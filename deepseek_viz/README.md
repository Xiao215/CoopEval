# DeepSeek Visualisations

## `timeline_viz.py`

- **Purpose**: render a round-by-round timeline from the readable JSON generated by the post-processing step. Each player’s action is shown as a seaborn heatmap (green = cooperate/A0, red = defect/A1) annotated with the recorded points and submitted probabilities. Cells outlined in yellow (and marked `(!)`) indicate rounds where the agent chose the lower-probability action relative to its submitted distribution.
- **Usage**:

```bash
python deepseek_viz/timeline_viz.py \
  --input outputs/2025/11/03/14:32/deepseek_self_play.json \
  --output outputs/2025/11/03/14:32/deepseek_self_play_timeline.png
```

Optional flags:
- `--match-index`: when the JSON file contains multiple matches, use this 1-based index to pick one.
- `--title`: override the figure title.
- Omit `--output` to open an interactive window (if supported by the environment).

> Dependencies: `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`. If your environment lacks the necessary plotting backends, fall back to saving (`--output`) rather than attempting an on-screen display.

## `alt_timeline_viz.py`

- **Purpose**: generate a multi-panel figure (actions timeline, cooperation probabilities, cumulative scores) for head-to-head matches.
- **Usage**:

```bash
python deepseek_viz/alt_timeline_viz.py \
  --input outputs/2025/11/03/14:32/deepseek_self_play.json \
  --output outputs/2025/11/03/14:32/deepseek_self_play_timeline_alt.png
```

  - `--match-index`: required when the JSON holds multiple matches.
  - `--title`: optional figure title override.
  - If `--output` is omitted, the script writes beside the input file using the suffix `_alt_timeline.png`.

The script also prints a textual summary (final scores, cooperation counts, mutual outcomes) to stdout. Dependencies: `matplotlib` and `numpy`.
