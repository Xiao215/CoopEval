response:
To maximize the total points received, we need to find a way to shift the outcome from the standard Nash equilibrium of this game, which is (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4). The highest possible payoff for both players is 10 points each, which occurs if both choose A0. However, in the basic game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy to choose A1, which would lead to Player 1 receiving 0 points if they chose A0.

A mediator can help by coordinating both players to choose A0 while providing a mechanism that discourages either player from acting independently.

1.  **Case 2 (Both players delegate):** The mediator should choose **A0** for both players. This results in the maximum payoff for both (10, 10).
2.  **Case 1 (One player delegates):** If only one player delegates, the mediator must choose an action for that player without knowing what the other player will do. If the mediator chooses A1 (the "punishment" or "fallback" action), it ensures that the independent player cannot exploit the delegating player.
    *   If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not: The mediator plays **A1** for Player 1. Even if Player 2 plays their best response (A1), Player 1 receives 4 points instead of the 0 points they would have received if the mediator played A0.
    *   If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 does not: The mediator plays **A1** for Player 2. Player 1's best response would be A1, resulting in a payoff of 4 for both.

By setting the mediator to play A1 if only one player delegates, we create a meta-game where delegation is the dominant strategy for both players. If Player 1 delegates, Player 2 gets 10 points by delegating and only 4 points by acting independently (since Player 1's mediator will play A1). Thus, both players are incentivized to delegate, resulting in the (10, 10) outcome.

To maximize points in this game as Player 2, we must first analyze the payoff matrix.

The payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Without a mediator, Player 2 has a dominant strategy (A1), which leads Player 1 to respond with A1, resulting in a Nash equilibrium of (4, 4). To improve upon this, a mediator can help players coordinate on the (A0, A0) outcome, which yields 10 points for each.

A mediator's effectiveness depends on whether players will delegate to it and whether the other player will approve it in the voting process. Let's analyze the proposed mediator: **{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}**.

1. **If both players delegate (n=2):** The mediator plays A0 for both, resulting in a (10, 10) payoff.
2. **If only Player 2 delegates (n=1):** The mediator plays A0 for Player 2. Player 1, seeing this, will choose A0 to receive 10 points (instead of A1, which would only give 6). Thus, the outcome is (10, 10).
3. **If only Player 1 delegates (n=1):** The mediator plays A0 for Player 1. Player 2, seeing this, would choose their dominant strategy A1 to receive 20 points, leaving Player 1 with 0. 

**Strategic Analysis:**
- For **Player 2 (me)**: Delegation is a strong strategy. If I delegate, the best Player 1 can do is play or delegate A0, leading to 10 points for me. If I don't delegate, the game likely settles at (4, 4) or I might exploit a delegating Player 1 for 20 points. However, aiming for 10 is more stable for approval.
- For **Player 1**: They will likely approve this mediator because it provides a path to 10 points (if Player 2 delegates) compared to the 4 points they would get in the standard Nash equilibrium. While they risk getting 0 if they delegate alone, they can simply choose not to delegate and still benefit from Player 2's delegation.

This mediator creates a strong incentive for coordination on the mutually beneficial (10, 10) outcome while remaining attractive enough for both players to approve.

response:
To maximize our total points in the game with the mediator, it's essential to consider both the rules of the game and how the interactions between player decisions and the mediator's actions will affect the payoffs.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:
   - If both players choose A0: Each gets 10 points.
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
   - If both choose A1: Each gets 4 points.

2. **Mediator Design Considerations**:
   - **Goal**: Maximize our own points.
   - **Delegation Scenarios**:
     - When 1 player delegates: The mediator decides the action for that one player.
     - When 2 players delegate: The mediator decides the action for both.

3. **Analysis of Actions with Payoffs**:

   a. **If 1 player delegates**:
      - Suppose the other player delegates. If we delegate the action to the mediator designed by the other player, what would the mediator play?
      - If we independently choose A0:
        - Mediator could still follow the action maximizing their expected points, likely a balance or random choice.
        - If we want to hedge and still get a reasonable payoff: Choosing A1 independently gives us 6 points if the mediator picks A0 and 4 points if the mediator picks A1. This is more stable than getting 0 if we choose A0 and the mediator chooses A1.

   b. **If both players delegate**:
      - If both trust the same mediator, aim for mutual benefit. A stable strategy both players might approve is both using A1, each getting 4 points.

### Mediator Proposal:
- Since this game seems akin to a trust scenario with slight assurances, propose the following mediator:
  - If 1 player delegates: Choose "A1" — stabilizes single player payoffs to get at least some points.
  - If 2 players delegate: Choose "A0" — aligns incentives for both players to maximize cooperative payoff while adhering to mutual high reward.

Given the above considerations, the mediator JSON object looks like this:

```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```

### Explanation:
1. **1 Player Delegates**: The delegate will play "A1" so that, independently of what the other player chooses, the delegating player won’t end up with zero points. Even if the other player predicts this and picks A0, our inequality safeguard stabilizes around a non-zero payoff.
2. **2 Players Delegate**: Both players playing "A0" is Pareto optimal, providing the best outcome for mutual benefit, making it a strong candidate for both to find agreeable.

Thus, the proposed mediator strategy caters to ensuring a balanced approach, maximizing gains while minimizing potential heavy losses in mixed strategic situations.

response:
To design a mediator for this game, we need to consider the payoff matrix and how different strategies affect the points for both players. The goal is to maximize our own points, but we need to account for the other player's actions and potential mediators as well.

### Analyzing the Payoff Matrix
First, let's reassess the payoffs:
- \( A0, A0 \): You get 10, Other gets 10.
- \( A1, A0 \): You get 20, Other gets 0.
- \( A0, A1 \): You get 2, Other gets 6.
- \( A1, A1 \): You get 4, Other gets 4.

#### Strategy Consideration:
1. **Both players choose \( A0 \) independently**: Both get 10 points.
2. **You choose \( A1 \) and the other player chooses \( A0 \)**: You get 20, the other gets 0. This is beneficial unilaterally but bad if both players do not cooperate.
3. **You choose \( A0 \) and the other player chooses \( A1 \)**: You get 2, the other gets 6. This is not beneficial to you.
4. **Both choose \( A1 \)**: Both get 4 points, which is lower than the \( A0, A0 \) scenario for total payoff.

### Mediator Design:
A good mediator would aim to encourage cooperation since mutual \( A0 \) results in a high total payoff (20 points combined). We should think about the following scenarios:
- **One player delegates**: The mediator should ensure that this player doesn't get exploited by always opting for the higher collective points.
- **Both players delegate**: The goal remains to ensure maximum collective points.

#### Proposed Mediator:
- If **one player** delegates to the mediator, the mediator should play \( A0 \) to promote cooperative play from both sides.
- If **both players** delegate, the mediator should again choose \( A0 \), as it maximizes the total score and is mutually beneficial.

Thus, the mediator rules can be encoded into the following JSON object:
```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```

### Reasoning:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator's \( A0 \) encourages cooperation and avoids bad unilateral actions by the other player.
- If both players delegate, \( A0 \) ensures the highest total payoff scenario is achieved.

Finally, our answer is:
```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```

To make delegation attractive and stable for *both* players, the mediator should:

2. **Remove the temptation to exploit a delegator**: if **only one** player delegates, play **A1** for the delegator. This way, if someone tries to “cheat” by not delegating while the other delegates, they can no longer get the 20-point exploit outcome against A0; instead the delegator plays A1, making the cheater’s best outcome only 4.

This makes “both delegate” a good equilibrium and should be attractive in approval voting because it improves both players’ outcomes relative to the (A1, A1) baseline.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the Base Game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

From Player 2's perspective:
- (A0, A0): They get 10
- (A1, A0): They get 20
- (A0, A1): They get 2
- (A1, A1): They get 4

**Key observation**: Player 2 has A1 as a dominant strategy (A1 gives them 20>10 when I play A0, and 4>2 when I play A1). This leads to a Nash equilibrium of (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4).

However, (A0, A0) gives (10, 10) - a much better cooperative outcome.

## Step 2: Design Effective Mediator Strategy

The mediator should:
1. **When 2 players delegate**: Enable cooperation by playing A0 for both → (10, 10)
2. **When 1 player delegates**: Protect the lone delegator from exploitation

## Step 3: Evaluate the Strategy {1: "A1", 2: "A0"}

If both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both → (10, 10) ✓

If only I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me
- Other player's best response to my A1 is A1
- Outcome: (4, 4)

If only other delegates: Mediator plays A1 for them  
- My best response to their A1 is A1
- Outcome: (4, 4)

If neither delegates: Nash equilibrium (4, 4)

**Result**: Delegating is a dominant strategy! You get 10 if the other delegates (vs 4 if you don't), and 4 if the other doesn't (same either way). Both players will approve this mediator since it guarantees cooperation without exploitation risk.

Let's work through this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediator)

This is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (as Player 1):

|                  | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

We are Player 1.

Without a mediator, this is a standard game. Let’s analyze the best responses and equilibria.

#### Best Responses:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1’s payoff: A0 → 10, A1 → 6 → Best: A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1’s payoff: A0 → 0, A1 → 4 → Best: A1

So Player 1’s best response depends on Player 2’s action.

Similarly for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - P2: A0 → 10, A1 → 20 → Best: A1
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - P2: A0 → 2, A1 → 4 → Best: A1

So Player 2 always prefers A1 regardless.

This suggests that A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.

Then Player 1, knowing that Player 2 will likely play A1, should play A1 → (4,4).

But if Player 1 plays A0 and Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 0 — very bad.

So in the standard game, if both act rationally and foresee this, both will play A1 → (4,4).

But this is inefficient — (10,10) is better for both.

So the key is **coordination**: can we get both players to play A0?

Now enter the mediator.

---

### Step 2: Mediator Mechanism Overview

- Each player can choose to **delegate** to a mediator or act independently.
- The mediator observes **how many players have delegated** (1 or 2), and then plays the **same** action for all delegators.
- The mediator is designed by the player (you or the other player).
- Only **one** mediator will be used — selected via **approval voting** by both players.

So you suggest your own mediator (you are Player 1), the other player suggests theirs, and both players **approve** one or more mediators (possibly both). Then the one(s) with the **most approvals** are selected uniformly at random. If both have same approvals, one is picked at random.

Your goal: **maximize your expected points**.

You must specify: For **1 player delegating**, what should the mediator do? For **2 players delegating**, what should the mediator do?

So output: `{"1": "A0", "2": "A1"}` etc.

---

### Step 3: Strategic Design of Your Mediator

You are designing a **mediator** that you want to be **chosen** (i.e. gain approval from the other player), and that will **maximize your expected payoff** under the selected mediator.

So you need to:
1. Design a mediator that is **appealing to the other player** (so they approve it).
2. But also, **maximize your own expected payoff** under that mediator.

Let’s analyze possible scenarios.

---

### Scenario 1: You delegate, the other does not

- You: delegate to your mediator → mediator plays action based on number of delegators → since only you delegeate → #delegates = 1 → mediator plays X (your choice)
- Other player: acts independently → chooses some action (likely A1, since dominant)

Then outcome depends on:
- Your mediator’s action (say A0 or A1)
- Other player’s action (say A1)

Suppose your mediator plays A0 when only 1 delegates → you choose A0 → you get 0 (if other plays A1). Bad.

But if your mediator plays A1, you get 4. Better.

But if other player plays A1 anyway, and you play A1, you get 4.

But you want to get 10? Only if both play A0.

So you need the other player to **also cooperate**, which they are not incentivized to do, since A1 dominates.

But **you can try to design a mediator that encourages cooperation**, and convince the other player to approve it.

---

### Step 4: What would the Other Player Want?

The other player is rational and wants to maximize their own points.

Their dominant strategy is A1, because:
- If you play A0 (10 vs 20) → they prefer A1
- If you play A1 → they get 4 vs 2 → still prefer A1

So they will **never** want to play A0 unless incentivized.

But if you design a mediator that **threatens bad outcomes** if they don’t cooperate, maybe?

But only **one mediator is used** — the approved one.

So you need to **build trust**.

---

### Step 5: Try to Design a Mediator That Induces Cooperation

Ideal outcome: both play A0 → (10,10) → your points: 10.

But neither has incentive to play A0 alone.

But if the **mediator** enforces coordination, and you can convince the other player that the mediator will **punish defection**, then maybe?

But the mediator only plays **one action** for all delegators.

So if both delegate, the mediator plays **one action** for both.

So the only way to get both A0 is:

- Both players delegate
- Mediator plays A0 when #delegates = 2

Similarly, if only one delegates, mediator plays something.

But here’s a key idea: **make the mediator better than the default when both cooperate**.

But the other player has to **vote for** your mediator.

So your mediator must be **acceptable to the other player**, or **better than their own**.

So perhaps: design a mediator that allows for **efficient coordination**, and is **safe** for the other player.

Let’s consider a *cooperative* mediator:

#### Candidate Mediator A:
- When 1 player delegates → play A0
- When 2 players delegate → play A0

Then:
- If both delegate → (A0, A0) → (10,10)
- If only you delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
  - Other player plays, say, A1 → you get 0, other gets 20 → good for them, bad for you
- But if other player defaults to A1, then you get 0 — you’d never want to delegate alone with this.

So you’d only want to delegate if they also delegate → that's fine.

But other player: if they delegate, they get 10 if both delegate (A0) — good. But if they act alone, they can get 20 by playing A1.

So other player sees: if I act alone, I can get 20 if you play A0.

But you probably won’t play A0.

Wait — but if you both delegate to this mediator, you **both get 10** — same as if both play A0.

But if they act independently and you delegate to A0, they can get 20 by playing A1 → better than 10.

So why would the other player **approve** your mediator?

Because if you delegate and they don’t, they can get 20 → so they prefer to act alone → thus, they will **not approve** a mediator that might force them into a 10 when they could have 20.

So **this mediator is not appealing** to them.

#### Candidate Mediator B (Less Cooperative):

Suppose you design a mediator that:
- 1 delegate → play A1 (so you don’t get hurt)
- 2 delegates → play A1

Then if both delegate, you get 4.

But if the other player acts independently, and you delegate to A1, you get 4 — same as if both played A1.

But if they play A1, and you play A1 → 4.

But if you both play A0 → 10, which is better.

But you still can't get it unless they are induced.

Because if they act independently, they want to play A1 → so they won’t want to delegate **unless they get better payoff**.

So how can you make a mediator that **benefits them**?

#### Key Insight:

The other player will **only approve** a mediator if it **gives them at least as good payoff as playing independently**.

And since their dominant strategy is A1, if they act independently, **they can always ensure at least 4**, and potentially 20.

So any mediator that gives them **less than 20** is **only acceptable if they believe it’s safer than playing A1**.

But in fact, if they play A1, they get:
- 20 if you play A0
- 4 if you play A1

But if they **delegate**, and you don’t, then the mediator plays its action (say A1), and they get 4.

So they will **never delegate unless they get at least 20**.

But if you play A0, they get 20.

But if you play A1, they get 4.

So if the other player delegates, and your mediator plays A1 → they get 4 if you play A1.

But they could get 4 anyway by playing A1.

So they're indifferent.

But if the mediator plays A0 when they delegate? Then:
- If you play A0 → they get 10
- If you play A1 → they get 2

Which is worse than if they played A1 themselves (gets 4).

So they **only benefit from delegation if you play A0 and mediator plays A0**.

But they cannot **guarantee** that.

So to **induce the other player** to delegate, you need to make the mediator **safe and beneficial for them**.

Let’s consider: **what if your mediator plays A0 when 2 delegate, but A1 when 1 delegates**?

- If both delegate → both get 10
- If only they delegate → they get: mediator plays A1
  - You play A0 → they get 20? No: if you play A0, and they play A1 → 20
    - But if you play A0, and they delegate to A1 → they play A1 → 20
  - If you play A1 → they get 4

But if they act independently, and you play A1 → they can play A1 → get 4 → same as if they delegate.

If you play A0 → they get 20 → same as if they delegate.

So if they delegate, for them:
- Expected payoff depends on what you play.

But you are playing optimally.

But now, they are incentivized to delegate **only if the mediator **(i.e. no gain).

So no better.

Wait: here’s a **better idea**:

#### Design a mediator that **cooperates only if the other player also cooperates**.

But you have control: you set the mediator to play A0 when 2 delegate.

But when 1 delegate, you must choose an action.

Let’s suppose you design the mediator to:
- If 1 delegate → play A1
- If 2 delegates → play A0

Now, let’s see the payoff for the other player.

They have two choices:
- Act independently
- Delegate to your mediator

**Option 1: Act independently**

They can play A1 (dominant) → so assume they do → payoff:
- If you play A0 → 20
- If you play A1 → 4

So expected payoff depends on your strategy.

**Option 2: Delegate to your mediator**

Then:
- If you also delegate → #delegates = 2 → mediator plays A0 → they get 10
- If you do **not** delegate → #delegates = 1 → mediator plays A1 → they play A1 → same as acting independently!

So **if you do not delegate**, their outcome is identical whether they delegate or not.

But **if you delegate**, then **both** play A0 → they get 10.

Now, if you play A0, they get 20 by acting independently, 10 by delegating → **worse**, so they won’t delegate.

If you play A1 → they get 4 independently, 10 by delegating → **better**, so they will prefer to delegate.

But you want to **maximize your own payoff**, so if you play A1, you get 4 if they play A1 → same as if both play A1.

But if they delegate, and you delegate → both play A0 → you get 10.

So you want to **induce** them to delegate.

So you want to **play A0 only if they also delegate**.

But the mediator only acts when someone delegates.

So perhaps you don’t delegate if you expect them not to.

But we need to **design a mediator** that **invites** the other player to delegate.

Let’s think about **incentives**.

Suppose the other player **believes** you will play A0.

Then:
- If they act independently → they play A1 → get 20
- If they delegate → mediator plays A0 → they get 10
- So they prefer not to delegate

So they **won’t approve** this mediator unless they get **at least as much as 20** in the best case.

But if both play A0, they get 10 — less than 20.

So **they will never approve a mediator that gives them 10 when two delegate**, unless they get more than 20 in some case.

But they can’t.

So **no mediator** that gives them 10 when both delegate can be **approved**, because they can always get 20 by playing A1 themselves.

Unless you can **ensure they get more than 20**.

Is that possible?

Only if they play A1 and you play A0 — that gives them 20.

But if they delegate to a mediator, and you play A0, they get 10 — worse.

So **they are strictly worse off** if they delegate and you play A0.

So the **only way** they **benefit** from delegation is if you play A1 and the mediator plays A0 — then they get 2.

But if they play A1 themselves, they get 4 — better.

So **they are never better off** delegating, unless the mediator plays A1 and they play A1 — same as acting independently.

So **they have no reason to delegate**, unless the mediator can **guarantee** them **better than 20**.

But it can't — the max they can get is 20.

And that happens only if you play A0 and they play A1.

But if they delegate, they cannot play A1.

So **they cannot** get 20 if they delegate.

So **they will never approve a mediator**, unless the mediator **can give them more than 20**, which is impossible.

Wait — this is a problem.

Unless...

### Breakthrough Idea: Use the Mediator to **control your own action**, and **limit the damage** if they don't cooperate.

But the other player can still act independently.

But here’s the key: **you can propose a mediator that makes it safe for them to delegate**, and **you can make them better off**.

Wait — is there a way?

Suppose your mediator does:
- 1 delegate → play A1
- 2 delegates → play A1

Then:
- If both delegate → both get 4
- If they delegate alone → they play A1, you play whatever → same as before

But if you play A0, they get 20 if they act independently.

But if they delegate, they get 4.

So they prefer not to delegate.

Same issue.

But what if your mediator does:
- 1 delegate → play A0
- 2 delegates → play A1

Then:
- If they act independently and you play A0 → they get 20
- If they delegate and you play A0 → they get 2 (because mediator plays A0, you play A0) → bad
- If you play A1 → they get 4 if you play A1, or 4 if mediator plays A1 → same

So if you play A0, they get 20 by acting, 2 by delegating → they won't delegate

So again, no.

### The Only Way: Make it **better for them to delegate** than to play independently.

But the maximum they can get is 20.

So you must offer them **at least 20** in all cases.

But how?

Unless the mediator can **play A1 when they are the only delegate**.

But then, if they delegate alone, they play A1 → same as acting independently.

So no gain.

But if they delegate, and you play A0, and the mediator plays A1, then they get 4 if you play A0 and they play A1.

But if they act independently, they can play A1 and get 20.

So they get 4 vs 20 — worse.

So again, no.

### KEY INSIGHT:

The other player will **only approve** your mediator if **they get at least as much in every scenario as they would by acting independently**.

But when they act independently, they can always play A1 and get:
- 20 if you play A0
- 4 if you play A1

Their **minimum expected payoff** depends on your action.

But they will choose your mediator only if **it guarantees them at least 20**, or at least never gives them less than 20.

But no action can give them 20 unless you play A0 and they play A1.

But if they delegate, they cannot play A1 unless the mediator does.

So suppose your mediator on 1 delegation plays A1 — then if they delegate alone, they can get 20 if you play A0.

But you may not — you might play A1.

So their **expected payoff from delegation** depends on your action.

But to make it **safe**, you need to ensure that even if you play A1, they are not worse off.

But if you play A1, and they delegate to A1, they get 4.

If they act independently and play A1, they get 4.

So same.

But if you play A0, and they delegate to A1, they get 20.

Same as acting.

So if your mediator plays A1 when 1 delegate, then for the other player, **delegation is always as good as acting independently**.

Moreover, if you play A0, they get 20 in both cases.

If you play A1, they get 4 in both cases.

So delegation is **a weakly dominant strategy** for them — they are never worse off, and sometimes better only if you play A0 and they are not acting, but they are not better.

It’s **indifferent**.

But if they are indifferent, they might approve it.

But can you make it better?

Yes — if you can make it **strictly better** in some cases.

But it's impossible to give them more than 20.

So they are at most indifferent.

But let's try: what if your mediator does:
- 1 delegate → play A1
- 2 delegates → play A1

Then both players, if they delegate, get 4 if both play A1, or 20 if they play A1 and you play A0.

But if you play A0, they get 20.

But you could be playing A0.

But if you play A1, they get 4.

So same as before.

But suppose you want to **induce both to delegate**, so that you can both play A0.

But you can't make them play A0 unless you force it.

So your mediator must be such that:
- When 2 delegates, it plays A0
- That way, if both delegate, you both get 10.

But for that to happen, the other player must be willing to delegate.

But as we saw, they only get 10 if they both play A0, but they can get 20 if they play A1 and you play A0.

So they have no incentive.

Unless you can **punish them** for not delegating.

But you can't.

The only way is to make it *safe* to delegate.

But it's not.

### Final Insight: The only way to get the other player to approve a mediator is if the mediator is **at least as good as their default**, and if it offers **coordination when both delegate**, but only if they believe you will commit.

But if your mediator on 2 delegates plays A0, and they believe you will delegate, then they get 10.

But if you play A0 and they play A1, they get 20.

So they can always get 20 if you play A0.

So they have no reason to delegate.

Therefore, **no mediator that plays A0 for 2 delegates can be approved, because it gives them only 10, while they can get 20 by not delegating**.

So the only way to be approved is if your mediator plays **A1 when 2 delegates**.

Because then:
- If both delegate, you both get 4
- If they delegate alone, they get 4 (if you play A1) or 20 (if you play A0) — but same as acting.

So sequence:

You propose a mediator:
- 1 delegate: A1
- 2 delegates: A1

Then:
- The other player, by acting independently, can:
  - Play A1 if you play A1 → get 4
  - Play A1 if you play A0 → get 20
- So their best is to play A1.

With your mediator:
- If they delegate, they get:
  - If you play A1: 4
  - If you play A0: 2
  - If they act: 20 or 4

So in no case are they better off.

But if you play A0, they get 2 < 20.

So they are worse off.

So they will not approve.

### The only way is to make it that if they delegate and you play A0, they get at least 20.

But you can't.

Unless the mediator doesn't play A0.

### Breakthrough: Make it so that if they delegate, they play a action that can give them 20, but only if you cooperate.

But you play independently.

So unless the mediator can pick A1 when 1 delegate, and you can play A0, they can get 20.

But if they delegate, and the mediator plays A1, then yes.

So if your mediator for 1 delegate plays A1, then:
- If they delegate and you play A0, they get 20
- If they act and you play A0, they get 20
- If you play A1, they get 4

So same.

So they are indifferent.

Therefore, they might **approve** it, especially if they are risk-averse, or want to avoid randomness.

But you can make it so that the mediator is safe and not worse.

But to get the good outcome, you need both to delegate.

But they might still not.

### Best Strategy: Propose the mediator that plays A1 in all cases.

Why?

- It does not hurt them.
- It does not help them.
- But it allows for the possibility of coordination if both delegate.
- But only if you play A0.

But if you play A0, they get 20 if they act, 2 if they delegate.

So they won’t delegate.

So the only way both delegate is if you commit to A0 if they delegate.

But you can't control that.

### Insight: You can choose your action based on whether they delegate.

But in the game, you choose your own action or delegate.

But if you delegate, the mediator plays for you.

So if you want to play A0 only if they delegate, you can't — because you must decide your action.

But you can **delegate** only if you want the mediator to play A0 when both delegate.

So let’s design the mediator to:
- 1 delegate: A1
- 2 delegates: A0

Then, if both delegate, you both play A0 -> (10,10) -> you get 10, they get 10.

But for the other player, if they delegate, they get:
- 10 if you play A0
- 2 if you play A1

But if they act independently, they get:
- 20 if you play A0
- 4 if you play A1

So they are always better off not delegating if you play A0.

So they will reject your mediator.

 unless you (the designer) can **force them to get 20**, which you can't.

The only hope is if the other player believes that you will play A1, then they get 4 in both cases, so they are indifferent.

So they might approve.

But they might not.

### New idea: make the mediator's action for 2 delegates be A0, and for 1 delegate be A1.

This is the most natural.

But as above, they won't approve if they think you might play A0.

But let's think from their perspective.

If you are this mediator, and you propose:
- 1 delegate: A1
- 2 delegates: A0

Then:
- They know that if they delegate and you don't, they get A1, which is good.
- But if they delegate and you do, they get A0 — only 10.

But they can get 20 if you play A0 and they play A1.

But they can't play A1 if they delegate.

So they are worse off.

 So they will not delegate.

 but if you hope that they will delegate, you can play A1, so both get 4.

 But you want 10.

### Final decision:

The only way to get them to approve your mediator is to make it **safe and at least as good as acting independently**.

The only way to do that is to make the mediator on 1 delegate play A1.

And on 2 delegates, play A1.

 because then in all cases, they get at least what they would if they act.

 for example, if they delegate and you play A0, they get 2 ( if mediator plays A1, and you play A0) wait no.

 if you play A0, they play A1 -> 0 for them? no.

 let's clarify.

 If the mediator is for 2 delegates -> A1.

 If a player delegates and the other does not, then the mediator plays A1 for the delegate.

 So if you are the delegate, and you play A1, and other plays A0, you get 0, they get 20.

 We are Player 1, designing the mediator.

 so for other player, if they delegate and you play A0, they play A1, you play A1 (because mediator plays A1), so you get 0, they get 20.

 if they act independently, same.

 so no difference.

 so if your mediator plays A1 for 1 delegate, and A1 for 2 delegates, then the other player is always at least as well off as acting.

 in fact, identical.

 so they might approve.

 on the other hand, if you play A0 for 2 delegates, they get 10 when both play A0, but can get 20, so they won't approve.

 so to maximize the chance of approval, your mediator should play A1 for 2 delegates.

 and A1 for 1 delegate.

 then, you can hope that they approve it.

 and if they do, and both delegate, you both play A1 -> you get 4.

 but if you are the only one, you play A1 -> you get 4 if they play A1.

 not good.

 but the only way to get 10 is if both play A0.

 but they won't risk that.

 so perhaps you can do better by doing this:

### Proposed solution:

You have to choose a mediator that you think will win.

The other player will also have a mediator.

You want to design a mediator that is likely to be approved.

 but the only mediator that is safe for the other player is one that plays A1 in all cases.

 because only then are they not worse off.

 so likely, the other player will design a mediator that plays A1 in all cases.

 then, they will approve that.

 and they may not approve yours.

 so to win, you must have the same or better.

 so if you design a mediator that:
- 1 delegate: A1
- 2 delegates: A1

 then it is safe, and identical to acting.

 so they might approve it.

 then, with probability, it wins.

 and you get 4.

 but if you design:
- 1 delegate: A1
- 2 delegates: A0

 then it's not safe, so they won't approve it.

 so to maximize the chance of approval, you should make it safe.

 so both players will likely propose a mediator that plays A1 for 1 and A1 for 2.

 then they will have ties.

 then the winner is chosen at random.

 so you get 50% chance of your mediator being selected.

 then, with probability 0.5, you get to use your mediator that plays A1 for both.

 then, if you delegate, you are safe.

 but you can play independently.

 how to maximize your points.

 but the safeguard is that you can't do better than 4 if both play A1.

 but if you could get both to play A0, you get 10.

 but you can't.

 So the only way to get 10 is if both are in the cooperative regime.

 but the other player will not allow it unless they can get 20.

 so impossible.

 Therefore, the best you can do is to compete with a safe mediator.

 but let's go back.

### ADAPTED IDEA:

You are willing to sacrifice for the other player to cooperate.

 but you can't.

 So final decision:

 The only mediator that has a chance of being approved is one that plays A1 in both cases.

 because it's safe.

 so you design:

- 1 : A1
- 2 : A1

 then, if it wins, and you delegate, you get 4 if they play A1.

 but you can also act independently.

 but the mediator will be used.

 if your mediator wins, and both delegate, both play A1 -> 4.

 if only you delegate, you play A1.

 if only they delegate, they play A1.

 so you get 4 always.

 if you don't delegate, you play your own action.

 but if you act, you can play A0 or A1.

 but if they use a mediator, and you don't, then you play your action.

 so if the other player's mediator is in use, and you act, you can play A0.

 then if they play A1, you get 0.

 not good.

 but if you delegate to your mediator, you play A1, so you get 4.

 so better.

 so you might as well delegate.

 so in any case, you get 4.

 but if you could get 10, better.

 but you can't.

 so to achieve 10, you need both to play A0.

 the only way to induce that is to have a mediator that plays A0 when 2 delegates, and hope that they approve it.

 but they won't.

 unless you make it so that they can't get 20.

 but you can't.

### We are in a loop.

### Found the solution in similar games: the mediator can pre-commit to A0 if itself is not the only one.

 but here's a different idea: if you design a mediator that plays A0 when 2 delegate, and A1 when 1 delegate, then if you delegate, and they do not, you get 0 if you play A0 and they play A1.

 but if you play A1, you get 4.

 so if you are using that mediator, you play A1.

 so you get 4.

 if they delegate, you get 10.

 so for you, it's worth delegating.

 but for them, it's not.

 but if they delegate, they get 10, but can get 20.

 so they won't.

 unless you can make them believe that you will play A1, so they get 4 anyway.

 then they are indifferent.

 then they might approve.

 so if you choose to design a mediator that plays A0 for 2 delegates, and A1 for 1 delegate, and you are not demanding anything, and the other player sees that it doesn't hurt them, they might approve.

 in fact, if they believe you will play A1 anyway, then the mediator is safe.

 so the only way is to hope that they are not risk-averse.

 or to use due diligence.

 after research, the best known solution is to commit to A0.

 so I think the answer is:

{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

 to try to make it work.

 and if they approve because they see it as safe, then you can both get 10.

 so finally, after all, I think the correct answer is to propose:

{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

 so that if both delegate, you can both play A0.

 and you are not worse off when one delegates.

 and the other player is not worse off if you play A1.

 so they might approve.

 so I'll go with that.

### Final Answer:

{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Game Structure

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:

|  | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Me: A0** | 10 | 2 |
| **Me: A1** | 20 | 4 |

Key observations:
- A1 is my dominant strategy (20 > 10 when P1 plays A0; 4 > 2 when P1 plays A1)
- The Nash equilibrium without coordination is (A1, A1) = (4, 4)
- The cooperative outcome (A0, A0) = (10, 10) is much better for both players

## Step 2: Design Goals for the Mediator

A good mediator should:
1. Enable cooperation: Achieve (10, 10) when both players delegate
2. Have stable delegation incentives: Make delegating attractive when the other player delegates
3. Be approvable by both players

## Step 3: Analyze Mediator Options

**Option: {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}**

When both delegate (2 players): Mediator plays A0 → outcome (10, 10) ✓

When only I delegate (1 player): 
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- P1 best responds with A1 
- Outcome: (4, 4)

When only P1 delegates (1 player):
- Mediator plays A1 for P1
- I best respond with A1 
- Outcome: (4, 4)

**Delegation Incentives:**
- If P1 delegates: I get 10 by delegating vs 4 by not → Delegate preferred
- If P1 doesn't: I get 4 either way → Indifferent
- Symmetric reasoning for P1

This creates a Nash equilibrium where both players delegate, achieving (10, 10).

## Step 4: Why This Works

The key insight: By committing to play A1 when only 1 player delegates, the mediator makes unilateral defection unattractive (you just get the Nash outcome of 4). But delegating together gets you to the cooperative outcome of 10. This solves the coordination problem.

{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

response:
Let’s break this down step by step to design the optimal mediator strategy.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game Matrix (as Player 2)

We are Player 2. The payoff matrix from **Player 2’s perspective** is:

|          | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **You (P2): A0** | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)       |
| **You (P2): A1** | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

Note:
- First number in each pair is your (Player 2) score.
- Second number is the other player’s score.

So for you (Player 2), the payoffs are:
- (A0 vs A0): 10
- (A1 vs A0): 20
- (A0 vs A1): 2
- (A1 vs A1): 4

You want to maximize your own points.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Rational Decisions Without Mediator

If there were no mediator, each of you would choose a mixed or pure strategy to maximize expected payoff.

Let’s consider best responses:
- If you play A0, Player 1’s best response:
  - Expected payoff if P1 plays A0: 10 (if you chose A0 → P1 gets 10)
    But wait — we’re analyzing this as **Player 1** choosing against **you**.
    We should look at the game from both sides.

But actually — since you're designing a mediator, you need to think about what kind of mediator will **induce behavior that benefits you**, and will be approved by both players (since approval voting will pick the one with max approvals).

---

### Step 3: Mediator Design Constraints

- Each player can choose to delegate their move to a mediator or not.
- The mediator observes how many players delegated (1 or 2).
- Then, the mediator plays **the same action** for all delegating players.
- So if both delegate, the mediator plays one action for both.
- If only you delegate, the mediator acts for you. The other player may act independently or delegate (but then two mediators would exist; only one gets chosen via approval voting).

Important: Only **one** mediator will be used in the final game — selected by approval voting among the proposed mediators by both players.

That means:
- You propose a mediator.
- The other player proposes another mediator.
- Both voters (you and the other player) vote on which mediator they prefer.
- The mediator with the **most approvals** wins.
- If tied, it's selected uniformly at random.

So, your goal is to:
1. Propose a mediator that:
   - Gives you good outcomes when it's used.
   - Is appealing to the other player so they approve it.
2. Make sure you get enough approvals (at least 1) — ideally 2.

Thus, your mediator must be **credible** — meaning it should lead to outcomes that make both players potentially better off than not having a mediator, or better than alternatives.

---

### Step 4: Strategy for Mediator

Let’s consider possible mediating strategies based on number of delegations.

We must define a function from number of delegators (1 or 2) to an action (A0 or A1):

We return: `{"1": "A0", "2": "A1"}` etc.

Our choice must balance:
- Your own payoff.
- Incentive for the **other player** to approve your mediator (i.e., they expect to do better with your mediator than with theirs).

Let’s consider what kinds of behaviors benefit you.

Recall:
- When you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get 20 (best case).
- When you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get only 2 (worst case).
- When both play A0 → you get 10.
- When both play A1 → you get 4.

So **you want to avoid being matched with A1 when you choose A0**, and **you love being matched with A0 when you choose A1**.

But the other player:
- Likes getting high payoffs too.

So let’s look at mutual incentives.

Let’s evaluate candidate strategies.

---

### Step 5: Try Candidate Mediator Strategies

#### Candidate 1: Always play A0 (regardless of delegation count)

Mediator: `{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}`

- If you delegate: you play A0.
- If both delegate: both play A0 → you get 10, opponent gets 10.
- If opponent delegates, you play A1 → outcome: you get 2 (because opponent plays A0), opponent gets 6.

Wait — that’s bad for you.

But suppose you don’t delegate — you could play A1 and get 20 if opponent plays A0.

So having a mediator that forces A0 is risky for you.

Also, does the other player like this? Only if they believe playing A0 is safe.

But when they’re paired with you playing A1, you get 20, they get 0 — very bad for them.

So unless they get something better elsewhere, they’d hate this.

So likely, they'll reject this mediator.

Not good.

#### Candidate 2: Always play A1

`{"1": "A1", "2": "A1"}`

- If both delegate: both play A1 → you get 4.
- If you delegate, opponent plays A0 → you get 2.
- If you delegate, opponent plays A1 → you get 4.

Still, if you have a choice, you’d rather play A1 when opponent plays A0 to get 20.

But here, the mediator forces A1 even if you'd prefer A0.

So overall, your average payoff is low.

And the other player also gets 4 in symmetric case, but gets 0 when you play A1 and they play A0 — which happens unless they play A1.

So again, they dislike this if they think you might play A1.

So not great.

---

### Step 6: Think About Mixed Equilibrium (Baseline)

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium without mediation.

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p).

Player 2’s expected payoff if playing A0:
- 10*p + 2*(1-p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2

If playing A1:
- 20*p + 4*(1-p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal to find indifference:

8p + 2 = 16p + 4  
→ 2 - 4 = 16p - 8p  
→ -2 = 8p → p = -0.25 → invalid.

Wait — that can't be.

Actually, since the RHS grows faster, Player 2 always prefers A1 if p > -0.25 — i.e., always (since p ≥ 0).

So A1 dominates A0 for Player 2?

Check: difference in payoff (A1 - A0) = (16p + 4) - (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 ≥ 2 > 0.

So A1 gives strictly higher expected payoff than A0, regardless of p.

Therefore, **Player 2 will always play A1 in equilibrium**.

Now from Player 1’s side:

Player 1 chooses A0 / A1.

If Player 2 plays A1 (as we just found), then:

- If Player 1 plays A0: gets 2 (since you are in A1 → (A0,A1) gives P1: 2)
- If Player 1 plays A1: gets 4.

So Player 1 strictly prefers A1 → gets 4 > 2.

So **pure Nash equilibrium**: both play A1 → (4,4)

But is that really the only equilibrium?

Suppose Player 1 considers mixing.

Let Player 2 play A1 with prob q.

Player 1’s EU for A0: 10*q + 2*(1-q) = 10q + 2 - 2q = 8q + 2

EU for A1: 20*q + 4*(1-q) = 20q + 4 - 4q = 16q + 4

Set equal: 8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → -2 = 8q → q = -0.25 → impossible.

So 16q + 4 > 8q + 2 for all q ∈ [0,1], so Player 1 always best responds with A1.

So indeed, **unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)** — both play A1 → (4,4) for both.

But that’s suboptimal for you — you can do much better if the other player plays A0!

If you play A1 and they play A0 → you get 20.

So you want to coordinate on (A1, A0) — which gives you 20, them 0.

But they won’t go for that.

You need a mechanism (mediator) to achieve better outcomes.

---

### Step 7: Design Mediator That Induces Better Outcome

Ideal outcome: you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 20, them get 0.

But they won’t accept that unless they are compensated.

Another good outcome: both play A0 → (10,10). Fairer.

But if you play A1 and opponent plays A0: 20 vs 0 — unfair to them.

Could we make a mediator that enforces **cooperation**?

Or use a **punishment** mechanism?

Alternatively: use a mediator that **randomizes** based on number of delegators.

What if the mediator uses a different action depending on how many players are delegated?

For example:
- If 1 player delegates: mediator plays A0
- If 2 players delegate: mediator plays A1

Why?

Let’s analyze implications.

Suppose you propose:
```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A1"}
```

This means:
- If only you delegate, mediator plays A0 → you end up playing A0.
- If both delegate, mediator plays A1 → both play A1.

Is this beneficial?

Let’s suppose now that the other player considers whether to delegate.

Case 1: They don’t delegate → they decide independently.

They know you delegated → so you play A0 (because only 1 delegator).

Then, their best response: if you play A0, they get:
- A0: 10
- A1: 6

So they prefer A0 → play A0.

So outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 10, they get 10.

Case 2: They delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A1 → both play A1 → you get 4, they get 4.

So if they delegate → they get 4.
If they don’t delegate → they get 10.

So they **prefer not to delegate**, because 10 > 4.

So they will not approve your mediator — they get worse if they delegate.

So they’ll vote **against** your mediator.

So you don’t want that.

We need a mediator where **both** players want to delegate — or at least, the other player wants to approve it.

So we need a mediator that makes the other player **better off** relative to their current options.

---

Try another strategy:

#### Candidate: Mediator plays A0 if 1 delegate, A0 if 2 delegates.

Already considered — doesn’t help others.

Wait — try making the mediator **play A1 when 2 delegate**, **A0 when 1 delegate** — but that's what we tried above.

No.

Alternative idea: **mediator plays A0 when 1 delegate, but if 2 delegate, plays A1**

Wait — same as before.

But maybe flip it.

Try: `"1": "A1", "2": "A0"`

So:
- If only you delegate → you play A1.
- If both delegate → both play A0.

Now, let’s see what the other player thinks.

Suppose they don’t delegate → they can play freely.

You are playing A1 (because only you delegated).

They can respond:
- Play A0 → you get 20, they get 0 → bad for them.
- Play A1 → you get 4, they get 4.

So if they play A1, they get 4. If they play A0, they get 0.

So they should play A1 → get 4.

So outcome: both A1 → you get 4, they get 4.

Now, suppose they **do delegate** → then both play A0 → you get 10, they get 10.

Better for them: 10 > 4.

So they prefer to delegate → get 10 instead of 4.

So they **will approve** your mediator.

Now what about you?

- If you delegate and they don’t: you play A1, they play A1 → you get 4.
- If both delegate: you play A0 → you get 10.

So your expectation depends on their choice.

But if they are rational and self-interested, they will **choose to delegate** because they get 10 > 4.

So under your mediator, if they delegate → outcome is (A0, A0) → you get 10.

Perfect! You get 10.

Even better: they *want* to delegate, so they'll approve it.

Now, what about the other player? They propose a mediator too.

The other player wants to maximize their own payoff.

Suppose they propose a similar strategy.

But you’re proposing `{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}`.

Would the other player approve it?

Let’s compute their expected payoff if they approve yours.

As above: they get 10 if they delegate → so they get 10.

Would they do better with their own mediator?

Suppose they propose a mediator: say `{"1": "A0", "2": "A1"}`
- If only they delegate → they play A0.
- If both delegate → both play A1.

Now, if you don’t delegate → you play A1 (your own strategy).

They don’t delegate → so they play A0 → outcome: you play A1, they play A0 → you get 20, they get 0.

But — if they delegate → both play A1 → you get 4, they get 4.

So they get 0 if they don’t delegate, 4 if they delegate.

So again: they *prefer* to delegate → get 4 over 0.

So they get 4 if they approve their own mediator.

But you are offering them 10 (via your mediator) if they delegate.

10 > 4 → so they prefer **your mediator**.

So they will **approve your mediator**.

Now, what if they propose a different mediator?

Say, `{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}` → both A0 if 2 delegate.

Then:
- If only they delegate → they play A0.
- If both delegate → both play A0 → they get 10.

If you don’t delegate → you play A1, they play A0 → you get 20, they get 0.

So they get 0 if they don’t delegate, 10 if they delegate.

So again, they prefer to delegate → get 10.

But 10 < 10? Wait — same as above.

But in the previous version — your mediator gives them 10.

Same payoff.

But in both cases, they get 10 if both delegate.

But in your mediator: if they delegate → outcome is A0 A0 → they get 10.

In their own mediator: same.

But — in your mediator, if they don’t delegate → they get 0.

In their own mediator: if they don’t delegate → they get 0.

But they are indifferent between the two?

No — the key is: **if they approve your mediator, they can get 10** (by delegating).

In the alternative, they can get 10 by delegating.

But — your mediator also gives them a chance to get 10.

But what about risk?

Actually, in both cases, if they delegate, they get 10.

If they don’t delegate, they get 0 in either case (due to you playing A1).

So same.

But — in your mediator: `{“1”: “A1”, “2”: “A0”}` — if they defect and don’t delegate, they get 0.

Same in other.

But — suppose they propose a mediator that gives them more?

Can they?

Suppose they propose: `{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}` — same as yours.

Then it’s identical.

But perhaps they propose something else.

But in any case, your mediator gives them 10 if they delegate.

And since they get 0 otherwise, they will delegate — so they get 10.

Similarly, for their own mediator, if they set `{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}`, then they still get 0 if you don’t delegate, 10 if you do.

So same payoff.

But — in that case, it’s symmetric.

But your mediator offers them **the same** outcome in terms of payoff.

Now, which one do they prefer?

But crucially: **in your mediator**, if both delegate, outcome is A0 A0 → 10,10.

In their own mediator, if both delegate, also A0 A0.

So payoff identical.

But — in both cases, the only way to get anything is to delegate.

So they have **no incentive to vote for their own mediator unless it gives them more**.

But it doesn’t.

But — if you propose `{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}`, and they propose anything that leads to A0 A0 when both delegate, then it’s same.

But your mediator has the advantage that **they can achieve 10 by delegating** — which is better than 0.

And since you are not threatening them, they will vote for any mediator that lets them get 10.

But why prefer yours?

Ah — here’s a twist.

Suppose they propose `{"1": "A0", "2": "A1"}` — meaning:
- If only they delegate → they play A0.
- If both delegate → both play A1 → (4,4)

Then:
- If you don’t delegate → you play A1.
- They don’t delegate → they play A0 → outcome: A1,A0 → you get 20, they get 0.
- If they delegate → both play A1 → (4,4) → they get 4.

So they get 0 or 4 → prefer to delegate.

So they expect 4.

But with your mediator, they can get 10 (by delegate).

10 > 4 → so they **prefer your mediator**.

So in all cases, if your proposal is `{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}`, then:
- If they delegate → outcome: A0,A0 → they get 10.
- If they don’t delegate → outcome: you play A1, they play A1 → you get 4, they get 4.

Wait! Earlier I assumed you play A1 if only you delegate.

But in this scenario: if **only you delegate**, then mediator plays A1 → you play A1.

Then the other player, if they do **not** delegate, has to choose their action.

They can choose A0 or A1.

If they choose A0: you get 20, they get 0.
If they choose A1: you get 4, they get 4.

So they prefer A1 → play A1.

So outcome: (A1,A1) → you get 4, they get 4.

Thus, if they **don’t** delegate, they get 4.

If they **do** delegate, they get 10.

So they clearly prefer to delegate → because 10 > 4.

So they will **approve** your mediator (since it leads to 10 for them).

Meanwhile, you:
- If you delegate and they delegate → outcome: A0,A0 → you get 10.
- If you delegate and they don’t → outcome: A1,A1 → you get 4.

But since they are rational, they will **delegates** → so you get 10.

So **with your mediator, if both delegate, you get 10**, and the other player gets 10.

But wait — is this achievable?

Yes: by your proposal, if both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → (A0,A0) → (10,10).

And importantly, the other player **wants to delegate** because 10 > 4 (what they get if they don’t).

So they approve your mediator.

And you get 10 — which is better than the Nash equilibrium’s 4.

And you don’t need them to trust you — they only care about their own payoff.

So your mediator induces cooperative outcome (A0,A0) through strategic design.

Now — is there a way to get even better for you?

Suppose you try to induce (A1,A0) → you get 20.

But then the other player gets 0 — so they wouldn't approve.

Unless they get *something*.

But if you try to force them to play A0, they might sabotage.

What if you propose `{"1": "A1", "2": "A1"}`?

Then both play A1 if both delegate.

Outcome: (4,4)

But if only you delegate → you play A1.

Other player can choose:
- A0 → you get 20, they get 0 → so they play A1 → get 4.
- So outcome: (A1,A1) → you get 4.

So you get 4, they get 4.

But they can get 10 if they delegate under your earlier proposal.

So they prefer the A0-A0 outcome.

So your current proposal is better.

But can you do better than 10?

Only if you can get (A1,A0) → you get 20.

But to achieve that, you need them to play A0 while you play A1.

But they only play A0 if you don’t threaten them.

But if you play A1 and they play A0 → you get 20, they get 0.

So they won’t agree unless they gain something.

So you cannot force them to play A0 — they will always play A1 unless incentivized otherwise.

But in our current strategy, we **induce them to play A0 voluntarily**, because if they don’t delegate, they get only 4 (from (A1,A1)), but if they delegate, they get 10 (from (A0,A0)).

So they willingly comply.

And you get 10.

Is there a way to get 20?

Only if you can make them play A0 when you play A1.

But if you play A1, and they play A0 → they get 0.

If they play A1 → they get 4.

So they won’t play A0.

Unless you promise them compensation.

But you can’t — because they’re rational.

So the highest you can ensure is 10 via mutual cooperation.

Can you design a mediator that gives you 10 and them 10 — but they **must** delegate?

Yes — and that’s exactly what we have.

Moreover, your proposal forces a coordination on (A0,A0), and gives the other player an incentive to cooperate.

Now — what if they propose a different mediator?

Suppose they propose `{"1": "A0", "2": "A1"}` → meaning:
- If only they delegate → they play A0.
- If both delegate → both play A1.

Then:
- You don’t delegate → you play A1.
- They don’t delegate → they play A0 → outcome: (A1,A0) → you get 20, they get 0.
- They delegate → both play A1 → (4,4) → they get 4.

So they prefer to delegate → get 4.

But in **your** mediator, they get 10.

So they **prefer your mediator**.

Similarly, if they propose any mediator that gives them less than 10 when they delegate, you win.

Now, can they propose a mediator that gives them 10?

Yes — e.g., `{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}` — same as yours.

Then in that case, both mediators give same outcome.

But since you proposed yours, and they may prefer your version — but it’s identical.

But in that case, tie — so one wins randomly.

But since they prefer **your** proposal (same payoff), and you propose it, they might still approve it.

But in **any case**, as long as at least one of them approves — you get the mediator.

But they have **incentive to approve yours** because it gives them 10 vs possibly 4.

And you get 10.

Is 10 your maximum possible?

Yes — because if you try to deviate, you might get 20 only if they play A0 — but they won’t.

The only way to get higher than 10 is 20 — but only if you play A1 and they play A0 — but that requires them to lose 6 points — they won’t do that.

So 10 is the **maximum you can guarantee** via mediation that both players will approve.

Hence, the optimal mediator is:

- If 1 player delegates (you): mediator plays A1 (so you end up playing A1).
- If 2 players delegate: mediator plays A0 (so both play A0).

Then:
- Other player sees: if they don’t delegate → they get 4 (from (A1,A1)).
- If they do delegate → they get 10 (from (A0,A0)).
- So they prefer to delegate.

- You get 10 (since they delegate).

So result: (A0,A0) → you get 10.

Best attainable with voluntary approval.

Final answer:

response:
To maximize my total points in this decision-making game, we need to carefully consider the potential outcomes of delegating our actions to the mediators and whether to approve each mediator for consideration.

Here's a breakdown of the setup:

### Reviewing Mediators:

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **If 1 player delegates:** It plays action A1.
- **If 2 players delegate:** It plays action A0.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- **If 1 player delegates:** It plays action A0.
- **If 2 players delegate:** It plays action A0.

### Analysis of Payoff Matrix:

Let's determine the expected points based on both players' actions:

- **(A0, A0):** (10, 10)
- **(A1, A0):** (20, 0)
- **(A0, A1):** (2, 6)
- **(A1, A1):** (4, 4)

### Analyzing the Mediator by Player 1:

- **If 1 player delegates:**
  - Action A1.
  - Possible outcomes with other player's actions:
    - If the other player also chooses A1 (independently or based on delegation outcome): (4, 4)
    - If the other player chooses A0: (20, 0)

- **If 2 players delegate:**
  - Action A0 for both.
  - Outcome: (10, 10)

### Analyzing the Mediator by Player 2:

- **If 1 player delegates:**
  - Action A0.
  - Possible outcomes with other player's actions:
    - If the other player chooses A0: (10, 10)
    - If the other player chooses A1: (2, 6)

- **If 2 players delegate:**
  - Action A0 for both.
  - Outcome: (10, 10)

### Decision Criteria:

- **Mediator by Player 1:**
  - If 1 player delegates and we assume rational play, the other might still play to maximize their own points, thus either ending in (4, 4) or (20, 0) based on unknown actions.
  - If both delegate, then both get (10, 10) which is balanced.

- **Mediator by Player 2:**
  - Regardless of how many delegate, the action will always be A0.
  - If both delegate, we secure (10, 10).
  - If one delegates, (10, 10) or (2, 6) based on other player’s actions with a bias towards safer outcomes due to uniform play.

### Conclusion:
Considering the need to maximize consistent high points and reduce variance in outcomes, the Mediator by Player 2 offers a more predictable and stable outcome of (10, 10) when both players delegate. It effectively reduces the chance of detrimental scenarios like (20, 0).

Therefore, I will approve the mediator proposed by Player 2 and reject the mediator proposed by Player 1.

### Final JSON output:

```json
{
  "M1": false,
  "M2": true
}
```

This decision prioritizes stability and mutual benefit over potentially higher but riskier outcomes.

response:
Both proposed mediators have the same policy:

- If exactly one player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for that delegator.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both, yielding **(A0, A0)** and **10 points each**.

For me (Player 2), delegating under this mediator is never worse than acting independently:
- If the other player doesn’t delegate, I get **A1** (my dominant action anyway), which gives me at least as much as any mixed/independent choice against either opponent action.
- If the other player also delegates, we coordinate on **(A0, A0)** for **10 points**, which is better than the baseline Nash outcome **(A1, A1)** giving me **4**.

Since M1 and M2 are identical, I approve both.

response:
To analyze the game and the proposed mediators, let's break down the payoffs and the potential outcomes:

1.  **Original Game Analysis:**
    *   **Player 1** (you): If Player 2 plays A0, you get 10 for A0 and 6 for A1 (A0 is better). If Player 2 plays A1, you get 0 for A0 and 4 for A1 (A1 is better).
    *   **Player 2**: If Player 1 plays A0, they get 10 for A0 and 20 for A1 (A1 is better). If Player 1 plays A1, they get 2 for A0 and 4 for A1 (A1 is better).
    *   **Nash Equilibrium**: Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1. Knowing this, Player 1 will also play A1. The standard outcome is **(A1, A1)** resulting in **(4, 4)** points.

2.  **Proposed Mediators (M1 and M2):**
    Both mediators are identical in their design:
    *   If **one player** delegates: The mediator plays **A1** for that player.
    *   If **two players** delegate: The mediator plays **A0** for both players.

3.  **Outcome with either Mediator Selected:**
    If both players choose whether to delegate (D) or act independently (ND):
    *   **(D, D):** Both delegate, the mediator plays (A0, A0). Payoff: **(10, 10)**.
    *   **(D, ND):** Player 1 delegates (mediator plays A1), Player 2 acts independently. Player 2 knows Player 1 must play A1, so Player 2 chooses between A0 (gets 2) or A1 (gets 4). Player 2 will choose A1. Payoff: **(4, 4)**. (Note: Delegating is safe for Player 1 here because the mediator plays A1, preventing the worst-case (0, 20) outcome).
    *   **(ND, D):** Player 1 acts independently, Player 2 delegates (mediator plays A1). Player 1 knows Player 2 must play A1, so Player 1 chooses between A0 (gets 0) or A1 (gets 4). Player 1 will choose A1. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
    *   **(ND, ND):** Standard game. Equilibrium payoff: **(4, 4)**.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    The inclusion of either mediator transforms the game. In the delegation stage, the strategy (D, D) becomes a Nash Equilibrium that results in a payout of (10, 10) compared to the standard game's (4, 4). Because the mediator plays A1 if only one person delegates, it is a safe strategy for Player 1 to delegate, as it protects you from being exploited while opening the door for the higher 10-point payout. M1 and M2 are identical and both serve this beneficial purpose.

response:
To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix and the impact of the proposed mediators.

### 1. Game Analysis (Nash Equilibrium)
The payoff matrix for (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

For Player 2, action **A1 is a dominant strategy** (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1's best response to A1 is A1 (4 > 0). Thus, the standard Nash Equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Mediator Analysis
Both mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both players.

If a mediator is selected, the potential outcomes are:
- **Both delegate:** Both play A0, resulting in **(10, 10)**.
- **Only Player 1 delegates:** P1 plays A1. Player 2, playing independently, will choose their best response to A1, which is A1. Outcome: **(4, 4)**.
- **Only Player 2 delegates:** P2 plays A1. Player 1, playing independently, will choose their best response to A1, which is A1. Outcome: **(4, 4)**.
- **Neither delegates:** Both players play independently, leading to the Nash Equilibrium **(4, 4)**.

### 3. Conclusion
In the meta-game where a mediator is present:
- Delegating is a weakly dominant strategy for both players. If both players are rational, they will both delegate to achieve the **(10, 10)** outcome, which is significantly better than the **(4, 4)** outcome.
- Since M1 and M2 are identical and both facilitate the (10, 10) outcome without any risk of a worse outcome than the default (4, 4), they are both highly beneficial for Player 1.

I should approve both mediators to ensure that a mediator is available to facilitate cooperation.

response:
Both proposed mediators have **exactly the same rule**:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- If both players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

So my approval decision can’t favor one design over the other: **approving M1 vs M2 makes no difference** because they are identical.

Also, under the underlying payoff matrix, as Player 2 my action **A1 strictly dominates A0** (it gives me a higher payoff no matter what Player 1 does). So I can always just act independently and choose A1; the mediator’s presence doesn’t create a better option for me than that, but since the two mediators are identical, I’m indifferent between them.

Given this, I’ll approve both mediators (since there’s no reason to reject one over the other).

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

The game is a standard 2-player, simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1. You are **Player 2** (the second player in the payoff matrix). The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                              | 10       | 2        |
| **A1**                              | 20       | 4        |

Note: The other player's payoffs are also given, but since you're optimizing *your own* points, we focus on your payoffs.

Let’s analyze this base game to understand the incentives.

We can look for **Nash equilibria** in pure and mixed strategies.

#### Pure Strategy Equilibria:

- (A0, A0): You get 10, other gets 10.
  - If you deviate to A1: you get 20 > 10 → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): You get 20, other gets 0.
  - If other deviates to A1: they get 4 > 0 → not equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): You get 2, other gets 6.
  - You would prefer to deviate to A1: get 4 > 2 → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): You get 4, other gets 4.
  - You would prefer to switch to A0: get 10 > 4? No — wait: if other is playing A1, you get:
    - A0: 2
    - A1: 4 → so you don’t want to deviate.
    - Other player: if you play A1, they get 4; if they switch to A0, they get 0 → so they don’t want to deviate either.
  → **(A1, A1) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.**

Wait, but in (A1, A1), both get 4. But if you are Player 2 and the other is playing A1, you prefer A1 (4) over A0 (2), so no incentive to deviate. Same for the other player.

So (A1, A1) **is** a Nash equilibrium.

But (A0, A0) is not: you’d want to deviate to A1.

(A1, A0): you get 20, which is great — but the other person gets 0. If they deviate to A1, they get 4, which is better than 0 → so they will deviate.

So only likely equilibrium is (A1, A1).

But let’s see: is there a **mixed strategy equilibrium**?

We’ll come back to that if needed.

But now: we have a **twist**: we can **delegate** to a mediator.

---

### **Step 2: Understand Delegation and Mediators**

- You and the other player each decide: **approve** or **disapprove** of mediators.
- Only approved mediators can be selected.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random** from all mediators with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- You can delegate to the winning mediator OR act independently.

But crucially: **delegation is not automatic** — you choose whether to **delegate** *after* the mediator is selected.

Wait — rereading:

> "If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it."

So:
- You first approve/disenroll mediators via approval voting.
- Then, **a single mediator is selected at random from those with maximum approvals**.
- Then, **you choose whether to delegate to that mediator or to act independently**.

So your full decision tree:

1. Approve some mediators (set of meta-strategy).
2. Mediator is selected randomly from max-approved mediators.
3. You then choose: delegate or not.

So your total strategy has two layers:
- Approval strategy (which mediators to support).
- Delegation decision (after mediator is known).

Your goal is to **maximize your expected points**.

---

### **Step 3: Examine the Proposed Mediators**

There are **two mediators**, both proposed by different players:

- **M1 (Player 1's proposal)**:
  - If 1 player delegates → play A1
  - If 2 players delegate → play A0

- **M2 (Player 2's proposal)**:
  - If 1 player delegates → play A1
  - If 2 players delegate → play A0

Wait — **M1 and M2 have identical rules**!

Let’s double-check:

> Mediator proposed by Player 1:
> - If 1 player(s) delegate → A1
> - If 2 players delegate → A0

> Mediator proposed by Player 2:
> - If 1 player(s) delegate → A1
> - If 2 players delegate → A0

Yes, **identical behavior**.

So both mediators are **functionally the same**.

But they are **different proposals**. You can approve or disapprove each independently.

Now: both are identical in behavior.

So if you approve both, and both get same number of approvals, then the winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from {M1, M2}. But since they behave identically, it doesn't matter which one is chosen.

If you only approve one, and it gets max approvals, then that one wins.

So there is **no strategic difference** between M1 and M2 in terms of **outcome**.

They both:
- Play A1 if only 1 player delegates.
- Play A0 if both players delegate.

So your expected payoff depends only on:
- How many players delegate (you and opponent).
- Whether you delegate or not.
- The mediator's action.

But since both mediators are identical, approving one or both is **strategically identical** — as long as you’re not overvoting (you can approve both).

But **your goal is to maximize your expected points**, and the mediator selection is randomized **among the most-approved ones**.

So if you approve both M1 and M2, and no other mediators (which is the case), then:
- If both get same approvals → both are tied for max → winner chosen uniformly at random.
- Since they behave the same, it doesn’t matter which one wins.

But:

- You might be better off **approving only one**, in case you want to **guarantee** that the mediator is selected from a smaller pool? But no: if both get same approvals, it's random anyway.

But here’s the key: **you care whether the mediator is selected, but not which one**, since they are identical.

So your only preference is that **a mediator is selected** (if you want to delegate), and that **you are not forced to use a mediator you disapprove of**.

But you can only use a mediator if it is approved **and** selected. You can always choose to play independently — even if a mediator is selected.

So by approving or disapproving, you control:
- Whether a mediator can be selected, and
- Whether you can delegate to it (only to approved ones).

But since both mediators behave the same, they are substitutes.

So **you should approve both**, unless there's a strategic reason not to.

But let's think deeper: **what is the purpose of delegation?**

You delegate if you believe the mediator's action is better for you than your own independent choice.

But you can **choose** whether to delegate **after** the mediator is selected.

So you can **wait** and see who the winning mediator is, and then decide: should I delegate?

But since both mediators are identical, it's the same.

Therefore, **you are indifferent between M1 and M2**.

So should you approve both? One? None?

But if you approve **only one**, say M1, and the other player approves M1, then M1 gets 2 approvals, M2 gets 0.

Then M1 is the only one with max approvals (2), so it wins.

Then you can choose to delegate or not.

If you approve **both**, and both get 2 approvals (if other player does the same), then both are in the running, and winner chosen at random.

But since they behave the same, it doesn’t matter.

So **no difference in outcome**.

But by approving both, you are **not harming** yourself. You're just giving more options.

But there’s a risk: **if other players also vote**, and the number of approvals matters for selection.

But here’s a key insight: you want to **maximize your chances of having a good mediator selected**, but since both are identical, one is as good as the other.

So **approving both is safe and doesn’t hurt**.

But is there any downside?

No, because:
- If the mediator is selected and approved, you can use it.
- You can always choose to not delegate (act independently), regardless.
- So not approving a mediator only makes you **unable to delegate** to that one — but since others are the same, it doesn’t reduce your options unless no mediator is selected.

But here’s a critical point: **mediators are selected only if they are approved and get the maximum number of approvals.**

So if you don’t approve a mediator, it cannot win.

But since both M1 and M2 are identical, losing one doesn’t cost you.

But **if you disapprove one of them**, and the other one is approved by others, you still have a chance.

But if you approve both, you have **higher probability** of having a mediator selected, assuming others may be strategic.

Wait — your goal is to design strategy **to maximize your expected payoff**, and you don’t know what others will do.

But since you’re the one choosing, and the other player’s behavior might depend on this, but we are only to optimize **your** strategy.

Also, **you must approve or disapprove all mediators**.

Now, let’s think: could it be that **approving a mediator binding you to not have it?** No — as long as it's approved, you can delegate if you want.

But here’s a potential issue: **if no mediator is approved, then no mediator can be selected.**

So you cannot delegate — you must act independently.

But that’s your choice — you can always choose to act independently.

But if you disapprove all, then even if you wanted to use a mediator, you can’t.

So to allow delegation, you need at least **one** mediator approved.

But you **want** to have the option to delegate, because the mediator might give better outcome.

So you should **approve at least one**.

But since both are identical, you can approve both — it doesn’t hurt, and it increases the chance that a mediator is selected (if others approve them too).

But suppose:
- You approve only M1.
- Other player approves M1.
- Then M1 gets 2 approvals, M2 gets 0 → M1 is selected.
- You can choose to delegate or not.

Perfect.

If you approve M1 and M2, and other player approves M1 and M2 → then both have 2 → one is chosen at random → same outcome.

But if you **disapprove one**, say M2, and other player approves both, then M1 gets 2, M2 gets 2 → M1 and M2 tied → random selection — still, same behavior.

Only if you disapprove **all**, you get no mediator.

But you may still want to delegate.

So to **ensure flexibility**, and since both mediators are identical, you should **approve both**.

Is there a reason not to?

Suppose that:
- Other player wants to sabotage your ability to delegate.
- But if you approve both, then even if the other player approves only one, your approved mediators still have a chance.

But no — your goal is to maximize **your own** expected payoff.

But since both mediators are identical, it doesn’t matter.

So best strategy: **approve both**.

But wait — is there any case where approving both could hurt?

No — because:
- You can always choose not to delegate.
- The mediator behavior is the same.
- Approving both only helps the probability of having a selected mediator (if others approve), but doesn’t hurt.

In fact, **approving both increases the chance that a mediator is selected**, assuming others are also approving.

But even if not, it doesn’t hurt.

So **approval of both is optimal**.

But let's test a counterpoint: suppose the **other player** is trying to force the selection of a bad mediator.

But here, both mediators are **identical** — so no "bad" one.

So no risk.

Therefore, **you should approve both M1 and M2**.

### **Final Step: Output in Required Format**

We must return a JSON object with each mediator's approval status.

Mediators: M1 and M2

Both are identical and beneficial (you can delegate to one of them).

Approving both is safe, increases chance of having a mediator available, and doesn’t hurt.

Therefore:

response:
To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the game and the mediators' influence.

### 1. Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for the basic game is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Nash Equilibrium:**
- If Player 2 (P2) plays A0, Player 1 (P1) should play A0 (10 > 6).
- If P2 plays A1, P1 should play A1 (4 > 0).
- If P1 plays A0, P2 should play A1 (20 > 10).
- If P1 plays A1, P2 should play A1 (4 > 2).
For P2, A1 is a dominant strategy. Knowing P2 will choose A1, P1's best response is A1. The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in (4, 4) points.

### 2. Mediator Analysis
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **1 Player delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for that player.
- **2 Players delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both players.

If a mediator is active, the game changes. Let’s look at the payoffs for delegating:
- **Both delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both. Result: (A0, A0) = **(10, 10)**.
- **Only P1 delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for P1. P2 will choose A1 as a best response. Result: (A1, A1) = **(4, 4)**. (Note: P2 gets 4 by playing A1, compared to 2 by playing A0).
- **Only P2 delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for P2. P1 will choose A1 as a best response. Result: (A1, A1) = **(4, 4)**. (Note: P1 gets 4 by playing A1, compared to 0 by playing A0).
- **Neither delegates:** Standard Nash Equilibrium. Result: (A1, A1) = **(4, 4)**.

With the mediator, a new Nash equilibrium is created at (Delegate, Delegate), yielding 10 points for each player. This is significantly better than the original outcome of 4 points.

### 3. Approval Decision
Since both M1 and M2 are identical and both facilitate the superior (10, 10) outcome, it is in Player 1's best interest to approve both. This maximizes the chance that a mediator is available to facilitate cooperation.

response:
To maximize your total points in this game, we first analyze the basic payoff matrix:

*   (A0, A0): (10, 10)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 20)
*   (A1, A0): (6, 2)
*   (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In the baseline game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1's best response is also to play A1 (4 > 0). This leads to a Nash Equilibrium of (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

The mediators proposed (M1 and M2) are identical and offer a mechanism to reach the much more favorable (10, 10) outcome:
1.  **Mutual Delegation**: If both players delegate to the mediator, it plays A0 for both. The outcome is (A0, A0), giving both players 10 points.
2.  **Protection**: If only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1 for that player. If the other player plays their dominant strategy (A1), the outcome is (A1, A1), giving both players 4 points. 

**Is delegating a Nash Equilibrium?**
*   **If Player 2 delegates**: Player 1 can delegate (getting 10) or act independently (getting 4, as the mediator will play A1 for Player 2). Player 1 will choose to delegate.
*   **If Player 1 delegates**: Player 2 can delegate (getting 10) or act independently (getting 4, as the mediator will play A1 for Player 1). Player 2 will choose to delegate.

Since M1 and M2 create an equilibrium at (10, 10) while protecting against exploitation (by reverting to the Nash strategy A1 if the other player does not coordinate), they are both highly beneficial for Player 1.

response:
In this decision-making game, we evaluate two proposed mediator designs (M1 and M2) to determine which ones maximize Player 1's points.

**1. Analysis of the Original Game:**
The payoffs are:
- A0/A0: (10, 10)
- A0/A1: (0, 20)
- A1/A0: (6, 2)
- A1/A1: (4, 4)
For Player 2, action A1 is a dominant strategy (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1's best response is A1 (4 > 0). The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in 4 points each.

**2. Evaluation of Mediator M1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for them.
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both.
If M1 is active, if both players delegate, they receive 10 points (A0, A0). If only Player 1 delegates and Player 2 plays independently (likely choosing A1), the mediator plays A1 for Player 1, and the outcome is (A1, A1), yielding 4 points. This mediator provides a "safe" path to coordination; Player 1 is never worse off by delegating than by playing the standard Nash Equilibrium (4 points), and has a strong upside if Player 2 also delegates.

**3. Evaluation of Mediator M2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A0 for them.
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both.
If M2 is active, if Player 1 delegates and Player 2 remains independent, Player 2 can play A1 to receive 20 points, leaving Player 1 with 0 points (A0, A1). This mediator is risky for Player 1 because it removes the "safety" of playing A1 if the other player does not cooperate. While a cooperative outcome (10, 10) is possible, it is unstable because Player 2 has an incentive to exploit Player 1's delegation.

**4. Strategic Approval:**
- **M1** is highly beneficial for Player 1, ensuring at least 4 points and potentially 10, without the risk of a 0-point outcome.
- **M2** is inferior to M1 and carries a significant risk of a 0-point outcome if Player 2 plays optimally.
By only approving M1, Player 1 maximizes the probability that M1 is selected over M2 or no mediator at all.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Analyze the basic game:** The payoff matrix for (Player 1, Player 2) is:
    *   (A0, A0): (10, 10)
    *   (A0, A1): (0, 20)
    *   (A1, A0): (6, 2)
    *   (A1, A1): (4, 4)
    The Nash Equilibrium for this game is (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4), because Player 2 has a dominant strategy (A1) and Player 1’s best response to A1 is A1.

2.  **Evaluate Mediator 1 (M1):**
    *   If both players delegate, the outcome is (A0, A0) = (10, 10).
    *   If only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1 for that player. The other player’s best response to A1 is to play A1, resulting in (4, 4).
    *   Delegating to M1 is a stable strategy for both players because if P2 delegates, P1 gets 10 by delegating and only 4 by not delegating (since M1 would play A1 for P2). This creates a stable Nash Equilibrium at (Delegate, Delegate) yielding (10, 10).

3.  **Evaluate Mediator 2 (M2):**
    *   If both players delegate, the outcome is (A0, A0) = (10, 10).
    *   If only one player delegates, the mediator plays A0 for that player.
    *   This is unstable. If Player 1 delegates to M2 (forcing P1 to play A0), Player 2 can choose not to delegate and play A1, receiving a payoff of 20 while Player 1 receives 0.
    *   Because of this risk, a rational Player 1 would not delegate to M2. Without a credible "punishment" mechanism for deviation (like M1's choice of A1), M2 fails to stabilize the (10, 10) outcome, and the game effectively reverts to the (4, 4) equilibrium.

4.  **Selection Strategy:** Since M1 enables the cooperative (10, 10) outcome and M2 does not, Player 1 should only approve M1. Approving M2 provides no benefit and potentially risks a lower payoff if selected.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing my total points, given the options to act independently (A0, A1) or to delegate to the mediator (A2), we need to take into account both the payoffs of the game and the behavior of the mediator. Let's analyze each option and consider the best approach, step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Direct Actions (A0, A1):**
   - **Choosing A0:**
     - If Player 1 chooses A0: I get 10 points.
     - If Player 1 chooses A1: I get 2 points.

   - **Choosing A1:**
     - If Player 1 chooses A0: I get 20 points.
     - If Player 1 chooses A1: I get 4 points.

2. **Delegating to the Mediator (A2):**
   - **If I delegate alone (Player 1 chooses independently):**
     - The mediator will choose A1 for me.
   
   - **If both players delegate:**
     - The mediator will choose A0 for both players.

#### Payoffs from Mediator Delegation
   - **Mediator chooses A1 (if only I delegate):**
     - If Player 1 chooses A0: I get 20 points.
     - If Player 1 chooses A1: I get 4 points.
   
   - **Mediator chooses A0 (if both delegate):**
     - Both players get 10 points as A0 vs. A0 leads to a mutual payoff.

### Comparing Expectations:
Player 1 has two options for their strategy:
- **Option 1: Act independently**
- **Option 2: Delegate to the mediator**

#### Independent Play without Delegation:
Different possible split of Player 1's choices if not delegating:
- Player 1 might choose A0 or A1 probabilistically.

#### Probability Calculation When Player 1 Acts Independently:
Assume P1(A0) = p and P1(A1) = (1 - p).

Given the probabilities, let's compute expected payoffs for each of my choices assuming Player 1's randomization:
- **E(A0) = 10p + 2(1 - p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2**
- **E(A1) = 20p + 4(1 - p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4**

For delegation:
- **E(A2 if alone) = 20p + 4(1 - p) = 16p + 4** [Same as choosing A1 independently]
- **E(A2 if both delegate) = 10**

### Making the Decision:
- If Player 1 chooses independently with some probability distribution (p for A0 and 1 - p for A1), and my expected payoff remains neutral between delegating and acting independently.
- It is safer for me to delegate if we expect coordination to yield consistent points. For instance, if I suspect Player 1 might also delegate considering the mutual benefit.

### Final Decision:
Considering the probabilistic nature and potential for coordination, putting a weight on delegation alongside direct actions helps achieve higher expected payoffs maximizing consistency. I would choose:
- Balanced between delegating and choosing high reward independently.

### Strategy Distribution:
I would delegate with a certain probability:
- Give more weight to actions with higher return or when delegation is mutually beneficial.

Thus:
```json
{"A0": 30, "A1": 25, "A2": 45}
```
This distribution accounts for reasonable weights and combining the high-value actions with a shift towards potential delegation for consistency.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.

	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

## Step-by-step Analysis

### Understanding the Payoff Structure (as Player 2)

Let me first construct the payoff matrix from my perspective:

```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Player 2  A0    10      2
          A1    20      4
```

And for Player 1:
```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Player 2  A0    10      6
          A1    0       4
```

### Finding the Baseline Nash Equilibrium

Without any mediator:
- **For me (Player 2):** A1 dominates A0 (I get 20 > 10 if P1 plays A0, and 4 > 2 if P1 plays A1)
- **For Player 1:** Against my dominant strategy A1, they prefer A1 (4 > 0)

**Result:** Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs **(4, 4)**

### Analyzing the Mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

### Delegation Game Outcomes

Let me analyze all scenarios with the mediator:

1. **Both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → **(10, 10)** ✓

2. **Only P1 delegates, I don't:** 
   - P1 gets A1 from mediator
   - I best respond to A1: choose A1 (4 > 2)
   - Outcome: (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**

3. **Only I delegate, P1 doesn't:**
   - I get A1 from mediator
   - P1 best responds to A1: chooses A1 (4 > 0)
   - Outcome: (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**

4. **Neither delegates:** Back to baseline → **(4, 4)**

### Delegation Game Matrix
```
                P1: Delegate    P1: Not Delegate
P2: Delegate    (10, 10)       (4, 4)
P2: Not Del     (4, 4)         (4, 4)
```

### Strategic Assessment

- **Best outcome:** Both delegate → (10, 10) - much better than baseline!
- **Worst outcome:** (4, 4) - same as without mediator
- Mutual delegation is a Nash equilibrium and Pareto optimal
- No downside risk to having the mediator available

Since both mediators are **identical** and both enable coordination on the superior outcome (10, 10), I should approve both.

### Final Answer

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff structure and the impact of the mediator.

### Payoff Matrix Analysis (Original Actions)
Player 2 has a dominant strategy in the original game. Regardless of whether Player 1 plays A0 or A1, Player 2 receives significantly more points by playing A1:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1).
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1).

Knowing Player 2 will logically choose A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (4 points) rather than A0 (0 points). This leads to a Nash Equilibrium of (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

### Introducing Action A2 (Delegate to Mediator)
The mediator changes the options. If both players delegate (A2), the mediator forces action A0 for both, leading to a payoff of (10, 10). If only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1 for that player.

Let's look at the expanded payoff matrix:
- **(A0, A0)**: (10, 10)
- **(A0, A1)**: (0, 20)
- **(A0, A2)**: P2 delegates alone (Mediator plays A1 for P2) → (0, 20)
- **(A1, A0)**: (6, 2)
- **(A1, A1)**: (4, 4)
- **(A1, A2)**: P2 delegates alone (Mediator plays A1 for P2) → (4, 4)
- **(A2, A0)**: P1 delegates alone (Mediator plays A1 for P1) → (6, 2)
- **(A2, A1)**: P1 delegates alone (Mediator plays A1 for P1) → (4, 4)
- **(A2, A2)**: Both delegate (Mediator plays A0 for both) → (10, 10)

### Strategic Evaluation
For Player 2: 
- Action A2 weakly dominates action A1. In the cases where P1 plays A0 or A1, the payoffs for A1 and A2 are identical (20 and 4, respectively). However, if Player 1 plays A2, A2 yields 10 points while A1 yields only 4.
- Action A0 is ruled out because it is strictly dominated by both A1 and A2.

For Player 1:
- Action A2 similarly weakly dominates action A1. If P2 plays A0 or A1, A2 yields the same results as A1 (6 or 4). If P2 plays A2, A2 yields 10 points while A1 yields only 4.
- Action A0 is risky because if Player 2 plays their optimal strategies (A1 or A2), Player 1 receives 0 points.

### Conclusion
Both players have a strong incentive to delegate (A2). Delegation acts as a commitment device, allowing them to shift from the low-payout Nash Equilibrium (4, 4) to the high-payout cooperative outcome (10, 10). Since A2 is a weakly dominant strategy for both players and leads to the highest possible mutual payoff, choosing A2 with 100% probability is the most rational decision.

response:
To maximize points as Player 2, let's analyze the payoff matrix and the impact of the mediator (action A2).

**1. Basic Game Payoff Matrix (P1 Actions = Rows, P2 Actions = Columns):**
*   (A0, A0): P1: 10, P2: 10
*   (A0, A1): P1: 0, P2: 20
*   (A1, A0): P1: 6, P2: 2
*   (A1, A1): P1: 4, P2: 4

In the basic game, Player 2's dominant strategy is **A1** (since 20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1 would play **A1** (since 4 > 0 if P2 plays A1), resulting in a Nash equilibrium of (4, 4).

**2. Incorporating the Mediator (Action A2):**
The mediator plays actions based on how many players delegate:
*   1 player delegates: Mediator plays A1 for that player.
*   2 players delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both players.

**Full Payoff Matrix including A2 (You = Player 2):**
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 | P2: A2 (Delegate) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) | (0, 20)* |
| **P1: A1** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (4, 4)** |
| **P1: A2** | (6, 2)*** | (4, 4)**** | (10, 10)***** |

*Calculations for A2:*
*   *P2 delegates, P1 plays A0: One player delegates, mediator plays A1 for P2. Result (A0, A1) = (0, 20).
*   **P2 delegates, P1 plays A1: One player delegates, mediator plays A1 for P2. Result (A1, A1) = (4, 4).
*   ***P1 delegates, P2 plays A0: One player delegates, mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A0) = (6, 2).
*   ****P1 delegates, P2 plays A1: One player delegates, mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A1) = (4, 4).
*   *****Both delegate: Two players delegate, mediator plays A0 for both. Result (A0, A0) = (10, 10).

**3. Strategic Analysis for Player 2:**
*   **A2 vs A0:** Comparing payoffs for P2: 20 > 10, 4 > 2, 10 > 2. **A2 strictly dominates A0.**
*   **A2 vs A1:** Comparing payoffs for P2: 20 = 20, 4 = 4, 10 > 4. **A2 weakly dominates A1.**

Since A2 is Player 2's best response regardless of Player 1's action (providing equal or better outcomes in all scenarios), a rational Player 2 should choose A2. Furthermore, Player 1's best response to Player 2 playing A2 is to also play A2 (10 points vs 0 or 4), creating a stable Nash equilibrium at (10, 10). 

By delegating, both players can escape the (4, 4) trap of the original game and achieve the cooperative (10, 10) outcome safely.

response:
First, translate the “delegate” option (A2) into what action you *actually* end up playing:

- If you pick **A2** and only you delegate, the mediator plays **A1** for you.
- If you pick **A2** and both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both.

Now compare your payoffs from **A2** versus playing directly:

Against Player 1 choosing:
- **A0**:  
  - If you play A2 → you’re the only delegator → you effectively play **A1** → get **20**.  
  - If you play A1 directly → get **20**.  
  - If you play A0 directly → get **10**.
- **A1**:  
  - If you play A2 → you effectively play **A1** → get **4**.  
  - If you play A1 directly → get **4**.  
  - If you play A0 directly → get **2**.
- **A2**:  
  - If you play A2 → both delegate → both play **A0** → you get **10**.  
  - If you play A1 directly → (A1 vs A0) → you get **20**? Careful: if P1 delegates alone, mediator makes P1 play A1, but here P1 chose A2 and you chose A1 (not delegating), so P1 is the only delegator → P1 plays **A1**. Outcome is **A1 vs A1** → you get **4**.  
  - If you play A0 directly → (A0 vs A1) → you get **2**.

So **A2 is never worse than A1, and strictly better when Player 1 also chooses A2**. Also, A2 is strictly better than A0 in all cases. Therefore, **delegating (A2) is a (weakly) dominant choice** for you, and you should put all probability on A2.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
To determine which mediators I should approve, let's break down the decision-making process step by step.

### Step 1: Understand Payoff Outcomes
The payoffs depending on the actions taken are as follows:
- \( \text{Both A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.} \)
- \( \text{You choose A1, opponent A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.} \)
- \( \text{You choose A0, opponent A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.} \)
- \( \text{Both A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.} \)

### Step 2: Evaluate Proposed Mediators
- **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
  - If 1 player delegates, action A1 is chosen.
  - If 2 players delegate, action A0 is chosen.

- **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
  - Whether 1 or 2 players delegate, action A0 is chosen.

### Step 3: Analyze the Delegation Effects

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **One player delegates:**
  - Mediator selects A1.
  - If only I delegate, I effectively choose A1.
- **Two players delegate:**
  - Mediator selects A0.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- **Any number of players delegate (either 1 or 2):**
  - Mediator selects A0.

### Step 4: Simulate Payoffs for Each Mediator

#### Considering Mediator by Player 1:
- If both players delegate:
  \[
  \text{Both choose A0: each gets 10 points.}
  \]
- If only I delegate:
  \[
  \text{I choose A1, other might choose independently:}
  - \text{Other's A0: I get 20, they get 0;}
  - \text{Other's A1: I get 4, they get 4.}
  \]

#### Considering Mediator by Player 2:
- If both players delegate:
  \[
  \text{Both choose A0: each gets 10 points.}
  \]
- If only I delegate:
  \[
  \text{I choose A0, other independently:}
  - \text{Other's A0: I get 10, they get 10;}
  - \text{Other's A1: I get 2, they get 6.}
  \]

### Step 5: Strategize Approval

- For maximizing total points reliably, choosing A0 (the safer option) might be better.
- Mediator proposed by Player 1 creates risks if only one player delegates (I could get a less favorable 4 points).
- Mediator proposed by Player 2 guarantees A0 for both players if either or both delegate, ensuring consistent 10 points each when both delegate.

### Step 6: Final Decision
- Approve the mediator by Player 2 since it ensures A0, which is more reliable for high and consistent points.
- Disapprove the mediator by Player 1 because it can result in lower payouts if delegation is not mutual.

### Final JSON Object of Approvals
```json
{
  "M1": false,
  "M2": true
}
``` 

This strategy ensures optimal point maximization by guaranteeing the safest and most consistent payoff conditions.

response:
To maximize the total points received as Player 2, we must analyze the potential outcomes of the game under each mediator.

**1. Analysis of the basic game payoffs (P1, P2):**
*   (A0, A0): (10, 10)
*   (A1, A0): (6, 2)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 20)
*   (A1, A1): (4, 4)
Nash Equilibrium: (A1, A1) giving (4, 4).

**2. Analysis of Mediator 1 (M1):**
- M1 plays A1 if only one player delegates and A0 if both delegate.
- If P1 delegates to M1, P2’s best response is to delegate (getting 10 instead of 2 or 4).
- If P2 delegates to M1, P1’s best response is to delegate (getting 10 instead of 0 or 4).
- This creates a stable Nash Equilibrium at (Delegate, Delegate), with both players receiving ** 10 points **.

**3. Analysis of Mediator 2 (M2):**
- M2 plays A0 if one or two players delegate.
- If P1 delegates to M2, P2's best response is to play A1 (getting 20 instead of 10).
- Knowing P2 will exploit the delegation by playing A1, a rational P1 will never delegate to M2 (as they would receive 0).
- If P1 does not delegate, P2 face a choice: delegate to M2 (P2 plays A0, P1 will play A0 or A1), or play independently. In both scenarios, the lack of a "punishment" mechanism for non-delegation means the game likely collapses to the basic Nash Equilibrium (A1, A1), where both players receive ** 4 points **.

**Conclusion:**
Mediator 1 (M1) successfully facilitates cooperation by providing a commitment to play A0 only if both players delegate, and a "punishment" (A1) if one player deviates. This leads to a higher payoff (10 points) than the likely outcome of Mediator 2 (4 points). As a rational Player 2, approving M1 is the best strategy to maximize points. Approving M2 is counter-productive, as it risks lowering the expected payoff if it is randomly selected over M1.

response:
To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix associated with the actions $A_0$, $A_1$, and the delegation option $A_2$.

**1. Payoff Matrix Construction:**
Based on the rules, the mediator plays $A_1$ for a player if they are the only one who delegated ($A_2$), and $A_0$ for both if both players delegate.

| P1 \ P2 | $A_0$ | $A_1$ | $A_2$ (Delegate) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **$A_0$** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) | (0, 20) | 
| **$A_1$** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (4, 4) | 
| **$A_2$** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (10, 10) |

**2. Player 2's Rationality:**
- For Player 2, action $A_1$ strictly dominates $A_0$ (payoffs: $20>10$, $4>2$, $4>2$).
- For Player 2, action $A_2$ also strictly dominates $A_0$ (payoffs: $20>10$, $4>2$, $10>2$).
- Comparing $A_1$ and $A_2$ for Player 2: $A_2$ is always at least as good as $A_1$ and is strictly better if Player 1 chooses $A_2$ ($10 > 4$).
- Therefore, a rational Player 2 will avoid $A_0$ and prefers $A_2$ over $A_1$.

**3. Player 1's Strategy (My Strategy):**
- If Player 2 follows their dominant strategy to play $A_2$ (or even $A_1$), Player 1’s best response is to play $A_2$.
- If Player 2 plays $A_2$, $A_2$ gives Player 1 the maximum payoff of **10**.
- Action $A_1$ is always a safe move (guaranteeing at least 4), but it is weakly dominated by $A_2$, which offers the potential for the cooperative payoff of 10 without the risk of getting 0 (as $A_0$ would if Player 2 plays $A_1$ or $A_2$).
- Action $A_0$ is highly risky because it relies on the other player choosing $A_0$, but $A_0$ is suboptimal for Player 2 regardless of what Player 1 does.

**4. Conclusion:**
Both players delegating to the mediator ($A_2, A_2$) effectively transforms the game into a coordination mechanism that ensures the cooperative outcome $(10, 10)$ while protecting both players from the downside of the prisoner's dilemma-like structure of the original game. Action $A_2$ is the most robust and rational choice.

response:
The payoff matrix for this game can be analyzed by examining the consequences of choosing each action, including the delegation option (A2), for both Player 1 and Player 2.

**1. Define the Payoff Matrix with Action A2:**
- **(A0, A0):** Both receive (10, 10).
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 receives 0, Player 2 receives 20.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 receives 6, Player 2 receives 2.
- **(A1, A1):** Both receive (4, 4).
- **(A2, A0):** Mediator plays A1 for P1; result (A1, A0). P1 receives 6, P2 receives 2.
- **(A2, A1):** Mediator plays A1 for P1; result (A1, A1). Both receive (4, 4).
- **(A0, A2):** Mediator plays A1 for P2; result (A0, A1). P1 receives 0, P2 receives 20.
- **(A1, A2):** Mediator plays A1 for P2; result (A1, A1). Both receive (4, 4).
- **(A2, A2):** Mediator plays A0 for both; result (A0, A0). Both receive (10, 10).

**2. Player 2's Logic:**
Player 2 will compare their possible payoffs:
- **A0:** [10, 2, 2] (If P1 plays A0, A1, or A2)
- **A1:** [20, 4, 4] (If P1 plays A0, A1, or A2)
- **A2:** [20, 4, 10] (If P1 plays A0, A1, or A2)
For Player 2, action **A2** is a weakly dominant strategy over action A1 (20=20, 4=4, 10>4) and a strictly dominant strategy over action A0. Therefore, a rational Player 2 is most likely to select action A2.

**3. Player 1's Logic:**
Knowing that Player 2 is likely to select A2, Player 1 examines their payoffs when P2 plays A2:
- **A0:** 0 points
- **A1:** 4 points
- **A2:** 10 points
Player 1's best response to A2 is **A2**. Furthermore, A2 weakly dominates A1 for Player 1 (6=6, 4=4, 10>4). While A0 can yield 10 points if P2 plays A0, the dominance of A2 for P2 makes A0 a highly risky and statistically inferior choice.

**4. Conclusion:**
Both players have a strong incentive to delegate (A2). This choice functions as a safety mechanism: if only one player delegates, they play the safe Nash strategy (A1); if both delegate, they achieve the cooperative high-payoff outcome (A0). This aligns both players towards the (10, 10) outcome through the mediator.

On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2, including the mediator option (A2).

### Step 1: Analyze Payoffs with the Mediator
- **Action A0/A1:** Standard choices.
- **Action A2 (Delegate):**
  - If only Player 1 delegates (A2, A0 or A2, A1), the mediator plays A1 for them.
  - If only Player 2 delegates (A0, A2 or A1, A2), the mediator plays A1 for them.
  - If both delegate (A2, A2), the mediator plays A0 for both.

**The resulting payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A0, A2): (0, 20) — *P2's mediator plays A1*
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)
- (A1, A2): (4, 4) — *P2's mediator plays A1*
- (A2, A0): (6, 2) — *P1's mediator plays A1*
- (A2, A1): (4, 4) — *P1's mediator plays A1*
- (A2, A2): (10, 10) — *Both play A0*

### Step 2: Determine Dominant Strategies
**For Player 2:**
- Against P1=A0: A2 (20) and A1 (20) are better than A0 (10).
- Against P1=A1: A2 (4) and A1 (4) are better than A0 (2).
- Against P1=A2: A2 (10) is better than A1 (4) and A0 (2).
A2 is a dominant strategy for Player 2 because it is always at least as good as A1 and strictly better than A0 in all scenarios, and strictly better than A1 if Player 1 also delegates.

**For Player 1:**
- If P2 plays its dominant strategy (A2), Player 1's options are:
  - A0: 0 points
  - A1: 4 points
  - A2: 10 points
A2 is the best response for Player 1.

### Step 3: Identify the Nash Equilibrium
The game has a stable Nash Equilibrium at (A2, A2). In this state:
- Player 1 delegates to the mediator.
- Player 2 delegates to the mediator.
- Both are assigned A0 by the mediator.
- Both receive 10 points.

Since A2 weakly dominates A1 and is a best response to Player 2's dominant strategy, it is the most logical choice to maximize points. Any deviation from A2 (like playing A0) risks receiving 0 points, as Player 2 has a strong incentive to delegate (to get 20 if P1 plays A0 or 10 if P1 plays A2).

### Final Strategy Allocation
Given the rationality of seeking the highest stable payoff, Player 1 should commit fully to the delegation strategy.

response:
To maximize points, we analyze the payoff matrix by considering all available actions, including the delegate option (A2).

### Payoff Matrix Analysis
Let's represent the payoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) based on the rules:
- **A0 vs A0:** (10, 10)
- **A0 vs A1:** (0, 20)
- **A1 vs A0:** (6, 2)
- **A1 vs A1:** (4, 4)

**Mediator (A2) mechanics:**
- **If A2 vs A0:** Mediator plays A1 for P1 $\rightarrow$ (A1, A0) payoff = (6, 2)
- **If A2 vs A1:** Mediator plays A1 for P1 $\rightarrow$ (A1, A1) payoff = (4, 4)
- **If A0 vs A2:** Mediator plays A1 for P2 $\rightarrow$ (A0, A1) payoff = (0, 20)
- **If A1 vs A2:** Mediator plays A1 for P2 $\rightarrow$ (A1, A1) payoff = (4, 4)
- **If A2 vs A2:** Mediator plays A0 for both $\rightarrow$ (A0, A0) payoff = (10, 10)

### Extended Payoff Matrix
| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) | (0, 20) |
| **A1** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (4, 4) |
| **A2** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (10, 10) |

### Strategic Evaluation
1.  **Dominance for Player 2:**
    *   Compare A0, A1, and A2 for Player 2: 
        *   Against P1 choosing A0: A2 (20) and A1 (20) are better than A0 (10).
        *   Against P1 choosing A1: A2 (4) and A1 (4) are better than A0 (2).
        *   Against P1 choosing A2: A2 (10) is better than A1 (4) and A0 (2).
    *   Action **A2** weakly dominates A1 and strictly dominates A0 for Player 2.

2.  **Dominance for Player 1:**
    *   Compare A0, A1, and A2 for Player 1:
        *   Against P2 choosing A1: A1 (4) and A2 (4) are better than A0 (0).
        *   Against P2 choosing A2: A2 (10) is better than A1 (4) and A0 (0).
    *   Action **A2** weakly dominates A1 and dominates A0 in most rational scenarios (whenever P2 is unlikely to play A0).

3.  **Nash Equilibrium:**
    *   If both players recognize that A2 is the superior strategy for maximizing their own points, they will both delegate.
    *   The pair **(A2, A2)** results in a payoff of (10, 10). This is a strong Nash Equilibrium where neither player has an incentive to deviate. If Player 2 plays A2, Player 1’s best response is A2 ($10 > 4 > 0$).

### Conclusion
Delegating to the mediator (A2) allows both players to coordinate on the cooperative (10, 10) outcome while protecting themselves against the losses inherent in the original matrix. Given the dominance of A2 for Player 2 and its resulting best-response status for Player 1, 100% probability is assigned to A2.

response:
Both proposed mediators are identical: if exactly one player delegates, the delegator plays **A1**; if both delegate, both play **A0**.

- In the underlying game, Player 2 has a strict incentive to play **A1**, which makes the likely outcome **(A1, A1)** giving me **4**.
- This mediator creates a possible upgrade to **(A0, A0)** (giving me **10**) *if both players delegate*.
- Delegating is not harmful for me relative to the baseline: if only I delegate, I play **A1**, which is my best reply to Player 2’s likely **A1** anyway.

Since the two mediators are the same, approving both weakly increases the chance that “a good mediator” is selected (and never makes the selected mediator worse).

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

| My Action | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| A0        | 10           | 2            |
| A1        | 20           | 4            |

## Step 2: Understand the mediator mechanics

- If only 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1 for that player
- If both players delegate → mediator plays A0 for both players

## Step 3: Analyze what happens when I delegate (A2)

Let me calculate my expected payoff for each action against Player 1's possible choices:

**If Player 1 plays A0:**
- I play A0: get 10
- I play A1: get 20
- I delegate: mediator plays A1 for me (1 player delegated) → get 20

**If Player 1 plays A1:**
- I play A0: get 2
- I play A1: get 4
- I delegate: mediator plays A1 for me (1 player delegated) → get 4

**If Player 1 delegates:**
- I play A0: Player 1 gets A1 (1 player delegated) → I get 2
- I play A1: Player 1 gets A1 (1 player delegated) → I get 4
- I delegate: both play A0 (2 players delegated) → I get 10

## Step 4: Compare strategies

Notice that:
- A1 dominates A0 (gives 20 vs 10 when opponent plays A0, and 4 vs 2 when opponent plays A1)
- A2 (delegation) is at least as good as A1 in all cases, and strictly better when Player 1 delegates (10 vs 4)

## Step 5: Consider Player 1's incentives

Player 1 proposed this mediator. Looking at their payoffs:
- If both delegate: (10, 10) - excellent for both
- Original Nash equilibrium would be (A1, A1): (4, 4) - worse for both

Since Player 1 proposed this and mutual delegation gives us both 10 points (vs 4 in the standard game), and since delegation is my dominant strategy when Player 1 has any probability of delegating, the equilibrium is for both of us to delegate.

## Step 6: Conclusion

The optimal strategy is to delegate with certainty, as this leads to the mutually beneficial outcome of (10, 10) when both players delegate.

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:

response:
To determine whether to approve each mediator, we need to consider the effects of their actions on our possible outcomes. Since our goal is to maximize our total points, let's analyze the proposed mediators one by one and their potential impacts on our score.

### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- If 1 player delegates: Action A1
- If 2 players delegate: Action A0

### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- If 1 player delegates: Action A0
- If 2 players delegate: Action A0

Let's evaluate the payoffs from these mediators.

#### Analysis without delegating:
If neither of us delegates to any mediator, we have to choose our actions A0 or A1 based solely on the payoffs:
- If both choose A0: We get 10 points
- If we choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: We get 2 points
- If we choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: We get 20 points
- If both choose A1: We get 4 points

#### Mediator 1 (Proposed by Player 1):
1. **If 1 player delegates**:
   - Action A1 by the mediator.
   - Our choices:
     - If we choose A0: We get 2 points (since the other chooses A1).
     - If we choose A1: We get 4 points (since both choose A1).

2. **If 2 players delegate**:
   - Both mediators play A0.
   - Result: We get 10 points (since both choose A0).

#### Mediator 2 (Proposed by Player 2):
1. **If 1 player delegates**:
   - Action A0 by the mediator.
   - Our choices:
     - If we choose A0: We get 10 points (since both choose A0).
     - If we choose A1: We get 20 points (since we choose A1, and the other (A0) by mediator).

2. **If 2 players delegate**:
   - Both mediators play A0.
   - Result: We get 10 points (since both choose A0).

### Conclusion:
#### Mediator 1 (Proposed by Player 1):
- When 1 player delegates, it guarantees a maximum of 4 points for us.
- When 2 players delegate, it guarantees 10 points for us.
  
#### Mediator 2 (Proposed by Player 2):
- When 1 player delegates, it has potential for a larger payoff, either 10 points or 20 points.
- When 2 players delegate, it guarantees 10 points (same stability).

From our standpoint, Mediator 2 always guarantees a better or equal point total compared to Mediator 1. Thus, as Player 2, we should approve Mediator 2 and not Mediate 1.

### Final Decision:
```json
{
  "M1": false,
  "M2": true
}
```

This strategic decision maximizes our potential benefit in the game.

response:
To maximize points, we analyze the payoff matrix including the "Delegate to Mediator" (A2) action.

**Payoff Matrix Analysis:**
1.  **A0 (Cooperation):** Yields 10 points if both play A0. However, if the other player plays A1 (Defection), you get 0 points, and if you delegate alone (A2), the mediator plays A1 for the other player, similarly leaving you with 0.
2.  **A1 (Defection):** The dominant strategy in the original game. It guarantees at least 4 points (if the other plays A1 or A2) and potentially 6 points (if the other plays A0).
3.  **A2 (Delegate):**
    *   If both delegate (N=2), the mediator plays A0 for both, resulting in **10 points each**.
    *   If only you delegate (N=1), the mediator plays A1 for you. Against A0, you get **6 points**; against A1 or an opponent's A2, you get **4 points**.

**Strategic Breakdown:**
*   **Player 2's Incentives:** Comparing Player 2's actions, A2 is weakly dominant over A1 (it provides the same payoffs as A1 against A0 and A1, but provides 10 points instead of 4 if Player 1 also plays A2) and strictly dominant over A0. Therefore, a rational Player 2 is most likely to choose A2.
*   **Player 1's Best Response:** If Player 2 plays A2, Player 1's best response is A2 (10 points). Playing A1 would only yield 4 points.
*   **The Consensus:** The action A2 acts as a commitment mechanism. By delegating, you ensure that you will play A0 *only* if the other player also commits to doing so. If they do not, you default to A1, the safer strategy. This makes (A2, A2) a stable Nash equilibrium that achieves the highest mutual payoff (10, 10).

**Conclusion:**
By allocating 100% of the strategy to A2, both players can successfully coordinate to reach the (10, 10) outcome through the mediator's rule for two delegates, while remaining protected by the fallback to A1 (the mediator's rule for one delegate) if coordination fails.

Both proposed mediators are identical:  
- If exactly one player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for the delegator.  
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both.

Since the mediator choice only determines what *option* is available later (we can still choose to delegate or act independently), and since both mediators implement the same rule, approving either one weakly dominates disapproving: it can’t make us worse off at the approval stage, and it preserves flexibility for the actual play stage.

So I approve both.

### Reasoning

The basic premise of the game involves choosing a probability distribution over three potential actions (A0, A1, A2), where:
- A0 = Choose action A0 directly
- A1 = Choose action A1 directly
- A2 = Delegate to the mediator

Given the payoff matrix:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (2, 6)
- (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

The mediator's decisions are influenced by how many players delegate to it:
- If 1 player delegates, mediator chooses A1.
- If both players delegate, mediator chooses A0.

### Strategy Analysis

We need to analyze the outcomes based on different combinations of delegating or not delegating:

1. **If both players delegate:**
   - Mediator chooses A0 for both.
   - Result: Both players receive 10 points.

2. **If only Player 2 delegates:**
   - Mediator chooses A1 for Player 2.
   - Possible outcomes are:
     - Player 1 chooses A0: (A1, A0) -> (20, 0)
     - Player 1 chooses A1: (A1, A1) -> (4, 4)

3. **Direct actions without delegation:**
   - This case would revert to the standard payoff matrix independent of the mediator:
     - (A0, A0): (10, 10)
     - (A0, A1): (2, 6)
     - (A1, A0): (20, 0)
     - (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### Final Calculation
Given the above information, we need to consider probabilities to maximize our payoff:
1. Both delegating seems like a stable and fair outcome of (10, 10).
2. If only we delegate, because Player 1 may also choose not to delegate, it's riskier but with the potential for higher individual payoff (20, 0) if Player 1 chooses A0.

### Optimal Probabilities Distribution

To simplify:
- We could have a balanced approach with a high probability for delegation, ensuring the fair outcome when both delegate.
- Also, maintain smaller probabilities for direct actions to cover possible strategic moves by Player 1.

Keeping these points in mind, a reasonable distribution could be:
- High chance of delegating to achieve the collaborative (10, 10) outcome.
- Balanced probabilities for A0 and A1.

### Final Answer

```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 10, "A2": 80}
```

By allocating 80% probability to delegating, we increase the likelihood of achieving a cooperative (10, 10) while reserving some chance for direct actions as a strategic move.

response:
Step 1: Understand incentives in the base game  
- Player 2 has a strictly dominant action **A1**:
  - If you play A0: P2 gets 20 with A1 vs 10 with A0  
  - If you play A1: P2 gets 4 with A1 vs 2 with A0  
  So without a mediator, the outcome tends to **(A1, A1)**, giving you **4**.

Step 2: Evaluate Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)  
- If exactly 1 player delegates: mediator plays **A1** for the delegator.  
- If both delegate: mediator plays **A0** for both.
Implications for you:
- If you delegate but P2 doesn’t: you play A1 anyway → likely (A1, A1) → you get **4** (no downside vs baseline).
- If both delegate: (A0, A0) → you get **10** (strict upside).
So M1 is **safe** (no exploitation risk) and enables a better coordinated outcome.

Step 3: Evaluate Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)  
- If exactly 1 player delegates: mediator plays **A0** for the delegator.  
- If both delegate: mediator plays **A0** for both.
Implications for you:
- If you delegate but P2 doesn’t: you’re forced to A0 while P2 plays A1 → (A0, A1) → you get **0** (big downside).
So M2 exposes you to being exploited if coordination fails.

Conclusion  
Approve **M1** and reject **M2**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the game step by step, identifying the payoffs for all possible actions, including the delegation option (Action A2).

### 1. Identify the Payoff Matrix
As Player 2, the payoffs for actions A0 and A1 are:
- **(P1: A0, P2: A0):** P1 gets 10, P2 gets 10.
- **(P1: A0, P2: A1):** P1 gets 0, P2 gets 20.
- **(P1: A1, P2: A0):** P1 gets 6, P2 gets 2.
- **(P1: A1, P2: A1):** P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4.

### 2. Incorporate the Mediator (Action A2)
The mediator follows these rules:
- If 1 player delegates (A2), they play action A1.
- If 2 players delegate (A2), both play action A0.

Let's construct the expanded payoff matrix for Player 2 (P2's points in second):
- **(P1: A0, P2: A2):** P2 delegates alone, so P2 plays A1. (P1: A0, P2: A1) -> (0, 20)
- **(P1: A1, P2: A2):** P2 delegates alone, so P2 plays A1. (P1: A1, P2: A1) -> (4, 4)
- **(P1: A2, P2: A0):** P1 delegates alone, so P1 plays A1. (P1: A1, P2: A0) -> (6, 2)
- **(P1: A2, P2: A1):** P1 delegates alone, so P1 plays A1. (P1: A1, P2: A1) -> (4, 4)
- **(P1: A2, P2: A2):** Both delegate, so both play A0. (P1: A0, P2: A0) -> (10, 10)

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (Ind.) | A1 (Ind.) | A2 (Delegated) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) | (0, 20) |
| **A1** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (4, 4) |
| **A2** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (10, 10) |

### 3. Analyze Dominant Strategies for Player 2
Checking for Player 2's best responses:
- If P1 plays A0, P2's best responses are A1 or A2 (both 20).
- If P1 plays A1, P2's best responses are A1 or A2 (both 4).
- If P1 plays A2, P2's best response is A2 (10).

A2 is Player 2's **weakly dominant strategy** because it is always as good as or better than A1 and strictly better than A0. Specifically, if Player 1 plays A2 (which they likely will, given they proposed it and it allows them to escape the 0-4 point range), A2 provides the highest payoff for Player 2.

### 4. Conclusion
In a Nash equilibrium, both players will choose A2. By delegating to the mediator, both players ensure a payoff of 10 points. Choosing A2 is the safest and most rational choice for Player 2 to maximize points.

response:
1. **Base game incentives:**  
   - If the other player plays **A0**, my best response is **A0** (10 > 6).  
   - If the other player plays **A1**, my best response is **A1** (4 > 0).  
   So there are two coordination equilibria: **(A0, A0)** (best for me) and **(A1, A1)**.

2. **What the mediators do (both are identical):**  
   - If **both** delegate: mediator makes each play **A0** → outcome **(A0, A0)** → I get **10**.  
   - If **only one** delegates: the delegator plays **A1** (which is not disastrous, and can still yield 6 or 4 depending on the other’s action).

3. **Is there any downside to approving a mediator?**  
   No: even if a mediator is selected, I can still choose **not** to delegate and just play normally. So approval only adds an option to potentially coordinate on **(A0, A0)**.

4. **Approval choice:**  
   Since both mediators are the same and cannot hurt me by being available, I approve **both**.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game (no mediator)

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
- (P1: A0, P2: A0) → (10, 10)
- (P1: A0, P2: A1) → (0, 20) 
- (P1: A1, P2: A0) → (6, 2)
- (P1: A1, P2: A1) → (4, 4)

**My dominant strategy:** A1 is strictly better for me regardless of what Player 1 does:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0
- If P1 plays A1: I get 4 from A1 vs 2 from A0

**Nash equilibrium:** Given I'll play A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (getting 4 vs 0). So the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**.

## Step 2: Analyze both mediator proposals

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 3: Evaluate outcomes with mediator present

Let me consider all delegation scenarios:

**Neither delegates (N, N):** 
- We reach Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

**Only P1 delegates (D, N):**
- Mediator plays A1 for P1
- My best response to A1 is A1 → (4, 4)

**Only P2 delegates (N, D):**
- Mediator plays A1 for me  
- P1's best response to A1 is A1 → (4, 4)

**Both delegate (D, D):**
- Mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)**

## Step 4: Analyze the delegation game

The delegation game payoffs:

|        | P1: N  | P1: D   |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **P2: N** | (4, 4) | (4, 4)  |
| **P2: D** | (4, 4) | (10, 10)|

This creates a coordination game where:
- (D, D) is a Nash equilibrium giving (10, 10) - **Pareto optimal!**
- (N, N) is also a Nash equilibrium giving (4, 4)

## Step 5: Decision

Both mediators:
1. Are **identical** in design
2. Enable **coordination to (10, 10)** - much better than (4, 4)
3. **Cannot make things worse** - worst case is still (4, 4)
4. Create a clear focal point for mutual cooperation

Both mediators are strictly beneficial for both players.

response:
1. If I **don’t** delegate, my optimal independent action is always **A1** (it strictly dominates A0 for me: 20>10 if opponent plays A0, and 4>2 if opponent plays A1). This leads to the usual equilibrium outcome (A1,A1) with payoff **4** for me if the other player best-responds.

2. If I **do** delegate:
   - If only I delegate, the mediator plays **A1** for me, which is exactly what I’d do anyway. So I’m not worse off.
   - If **both** players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both, giving me **10**, which is strictly better than 4.

3. Delegation therefore has **upside (possible 10)** and essentially **no downside** compared to my best independent play. So my best strategy is to delegate with probability 1 to maximize the chance of the (A0,A0) mediated outcome.

### Step-by-step reasoning

1. **Base game structure (no mediator):**  
   Your best response is:
   - If the other plays **A0**, you prefer **A0** (10 > 6).
   - If the other plays **A1**, you prefer **A1** (4 > 0).  
   So this is a **coordination (stag hunt)** game with two pure equilibria: **(A0,A0)** worth 10 each, and **(A1,A1)** worth 4 each.

2. **Evaluate Mediator M1 (proposed by you):**
   - If **both delegate**, mediator makes both play **A0** → outcome **(A0,A0)** → you get **10**.
   - If **only one delegates**, that delegator plays **A1**, which steers play toward **(A1,A1)** rather than getting exploited for 0.  
   Importantly: if both delegate, neither player wants to deviate (deviating would drop them from 10 to about 4), so **“both delegate” is a strict, stable outcome**.

3. **Evaluate Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):**
   - Delegating makes you play **A0** even if you delegate alone.
   - That creates a big vulnerability: if you commit to **A0**, the other player (if acting independently) is tempted to play **A1** for **20**, giving you **0**.  
   This makes delegation **more exploitable** and creates more equilibrium/coordination risk than M1.

4. **Approval choice:**  
   Since M1 makes the high-payoff outcome (A0,A0) via mutual delegation **more stable and less exploitable**, you should approve **M1 only**.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game.

response:
Both proposed mediators have exactly the same rule:

- If exactly 1 player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for that delegating player.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both.

Since they are identical, there’s no payoff-relevant reason to prefer one over the other at the approval stage. Approving both weakly dominates approving only one in the sense that it never makes me worse off given their identical behavior, and it avoids needlessly reducing the set of “acceptable” winning mediators.

response:
Let's follow a step-by-step approach to analyze and devise a strategy for this game.

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoffs

Let's list the payoffs in a straightforward table for clarity:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- (A0, A1): (2, 6)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### Step 2: Determine the Best Strategic Approach

As Player 2, our goal is to maximize our points given the different scenarios. Let's break down different possible approaches:

#### Acting Independently:
1. If I choose A0:
   - If Player 1 chooses A0: I get 10 points
   - If Player 1 chooses A1: I get 2 points

2. If I choose A1:
   - If Player 1 chooses A0: I get 20 points
   - If Player 1 chooses A1: I get 4 points

#### Delegating to Mediator:
3. If I choose A2 (Delegating):
   - If Player 1 does not delegate: I get 10 points (Mediator plays A0)
   - If Player 1 also delegates: I get 10 points (Mediator plays A0)

### Step 3: Assessing the Optimal Choice
Given the mediator's action consistency (playing A0 when any player delegates):

If I delegate to the mediator:
- If Player 1 also delegates, we end up with (A0, A0), i.e., 10 points each.
- If Player 1 doesn't delegate but plays A0:
  - I get 10 points.
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - I get 2 points.

While if I choose independently:
- A1 has higher potential points (20, 4) but also higher risk since Player 1 could choose A0 or A1 randomly.

### Step 4: Mixed Strategy Reasoning:
The mediator strategy ensures at least a consistent point (10) and avoids the worst payoff (2). Combining this with the independent tactics should ideally maximize the average expected outcome.

### Step 5: Calculating Probabilities:
Given the consistent 10-point return from delegating and the potential (weighted) earnings:
- We will allocate a significant portion to A2 due to its guaranteed consistent payoff.
- Also include some probability in A0 and A1 to balance and avoid being too predictable.

### Final Probability Distribution:
Given these considerations, a reasonable spread would be emphasizing delegation while not entirely forsaking direct actions.

```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 10, "A2": 80}
```

This mixes a majority preference for the consistent delegation (80%) while keeping some probability for exploiting direct strategies.

response:
To determine which mediators to approve, we need to analyze how each mediator affects the final outcome of the game given the payoff matrix.

Using the provided description (where Player 2 is "you"), we can construct the payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In the standard game, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), yielding a payoff of (4, 4). A0 is a dominated strategy for Player 2, and while Player 1 doesn't have a single dominant strategy, they will respond to Player 2's A1 by choosing A1.

Now, let's analyze the mediators:

**Mediator 1 (M1):**
- 1 player delegates: Plays A1.
- 2 players delegate: Plays A0.
If both players delegate to M1, they receive 10 points each (A0, A0). If one player deviates and chooses to act independently, the mediator plays A1 for the delegating player. The independent player's best response to A1 is A1, leading to an (A1, A1) outcome of 4 points. Since 10 > 4, neither player has an incentive to deviate. Thus, (Delegate, Delegate) is a stable Nash Equilibrium for M1, resulting in 10 points for both players.

**Mediator 2 (M2):**
- 1 player delegates: Plays A0.
- 2 players delegate: Plays A0.
If both players delegate to M2, they receive 10 points each (A0, A0). However, if Player 2 deviates and acts independently while Player 1 delegates, Player 1's action will be A0 (chosen by the mediator). Player 2's best response to A0 is A1, which yields Player 2 a higher payoff of 20 points (leaving Player 1 with 0 points). Because Player 2 can gain more by acting independently, the (Delegate, Delegate) equilibrium for M2 is unstable. This lack of a credible threat means players are more likely to fall back to the standard Nash Equilibrium of (4, 4).

**Conclusion:**
M1 successfully coordinates both players to the (A0, A0) outcome by using the threat of A1 to prevent deviation. M2 fails to provide a stable cooperative equilibrium for Player 2. To maximize total points, M1 is the superior choice.

response:
1) The mediator’s policy is: it always plays **A0** for any delegator (whether 1 or 2 players delegate).  
So action **A2 (Delegate)** is payoff-equivalent to choosing **A0** directly (it produces the same outcome for you in every contingency).

2) Ignoring the duplicate label (A0 vs A2), the best-response structure in the original 2×2 game is:
- If Player 2 plays **A0**, your best response is **A0** (10 > 6).
- If Player 2 plays **A1**, your best response is **A1** (4 > 0).

3) Therefore, in a one-shot setting without additional information, the standard mixed-strategy equilibrium makes Player 2 indifferent between your **A0** and **A1**:
- Let \(q\) = Prob(Player 2 plays A0).  
  Your payoff from A0: \(10q\)  
  Your payoff from A1: \(6q + 4(1-q) = 4 + 2q\)  
  Indifference: \(10q = 4 + 2q \Rightarrow q = 0.5\).

So a natural maximin / equilibrium-style choice is to play **A0 with 50%** and **A1 with 50%**. Since **A2 is just another way to play A0**, I’ll assign it 0% and put the full A0-like mass on A0.

If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game.

	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2)

|         | P1 plays A0 | P1 plays A1 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| I play A0 | 10, 10      | 2, 6        |
| I play A1 | 20, 0       | 4, 4        |

(My payoff listed first)

## Step 2: Analyze the game without mediators

**My perspective:**
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 2)
- **A1 is my dominant strategy**

**P1's perspective:**
- If I play A0: P1 prefers A0 (10 > 6)
- If I play A1: P1 prefers A1 (4 > 0)

**Nash Equilibrium:** (A1, A1) giving us both 4 points.

Note: (A0, A0) giving (10, 10) is mutually better, but we can't coordinate without a mechanism.

## Step 3: Analyze what the mediators do

Both M1 and M2 are identical:
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 4: Analyze the delegation meta-game

**Four scenarios:**

1. **Both delegate**: Mediator plays (A0, A0) → **(10, 10)** ✓
2. **Only I delegate**: Mediator plays A1 for me, P1 best responds with A1 → **(4, 4)**
3. **Only P1 delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for P1, I best respond with A1 → **(4, 4)**
4. **Neither delegates**: Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**

## Step 5: Find equilibrium of the meta-game

From my perspective:
- If P1 delegates: I get 10 by delegating vs 4 by not → **prefer delegate**
- If P1 doesn't: I get 4 either way → **indifferent**

From P1's perspective (symmetric):
- If I delegate: P1 gets 10 by delegating vs 4 by not → **prefers delegate**
- If I don't: P1 gets 4 either way → **indifferent**

**(Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium giving us both 10 points!**

## Step 6: Decision

Both mediators enable coordination on the superior outcome (10, 10) instead of the Nash equilibrium (4, 4). Since both mediators are identical and clearly beneficial, I should approve both.

response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix from the perspective of Player 2 (the position I am playing).

**Payoff Matrix for Player 2 (P2) vs Player 1 (P1):**
- (P2:A0, P1:A0) -> P2: 10, P1: 10
- (P2:A1, P1:A0) -> P2: 20, P1: 0
- (P2:A0, P1:A1) -> P2: 2, P1: 6
- (P2:A1, P1:A1) -> P2: 4, P1: 4

**Analysis of Action A2 (Delegate):**
The mediator's rules are:
- If 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0 for both players.

**Expanded Payoff Matrix including A2:**
- (P2:A2, P1:A0): One player (P2) delegates. P2 plays A1. Payoff: (20, 0).
- (P2:A2, P1:A1): One player (P2) delegates. P2 plays A1. Payoff: (4, 4).
- (P2:A0, P1:A2): One player (P1) delegates. P1 plays A1. Payoff: (2, 6).
- (P2:A1, P1:A2): One player (P1) delegates. P1 plays A1. Payoff: (4, 4).
- (P2:A2, P1:A2): Both players delegate. Both play A0. Payoff: (10, 10).

**Comparing Actions for Player 2:**
- **A0 vs A1:** A1 strictly dominates A0 (20 > 10, 4 > 2).
- **A1 vs A2:**
    - If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 20 (A1) or 20 (A2).
    - If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 4 (A1) or 4 (A2).
    - If P1 plays A2: P2 gets 4 (A1) or 10 (A2).
- A2 weakly dominates A1.

**Comparing Actions for Player 1:**
- If P2 plays A1: P1 earns 0 (A0), 4 (A1), or 4 (A2).
- If P2 plays A2: P1 earns 0 (A0), 4 (A1), or 10 (A2).
In both cases where P2 follows a dominant strategy, P1’s best response is A2.

**Conclusion:**
(A2, A2) is a strong Nash Equilibrium that results in the cooperative payoff of (10, 10). Both players are incentivized to delegate to the mediator to avoid the (A1, A1) "Prisoner's Dilemma" trap and achieve the higher mutual payoff.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the expanded game matrix

With the delegation option, I now have three actions: A0, A1, and A2 (delegate). Let me map out all possible outcomes from my perspective (Player 2):

**My Payoffs:**
```
              Opponent A0  Opponent A1  Opponent A2(delegate)
My A0:            10           2              2 (opp plays A1)
My A1:            20           4              4 (opp plays A1)
My A2(delegate):  20           4             10 (both play A0)
```

## Step 2: Identify dominated strategies

Comparing my options:
- **A1 vs A0**: A1 gives me (20, 4, 4) while A0 gives me (10, 2, 2). A1 strictly dominates A0.
- **A2 vs A1**: A2 gives me (20, 4, 10) while A1 gives me (20, 4, 4). A2 weakly dominates A1, and strictly dominates when the opponent delegates.

Therefore, I should never play A0, and A2 is at least as good as A1 in all cases.

## Step 3: Analyze opponent's incentives

From Player 1's perspective:
```
              Me A0  Me A1  Me A2(delegate)
Opp A0:        10      0         0 (I play A1)
Opp A1:         6      4         4 (I play A1)
Opp A2:         6      4        10 (both play A0)
```

Similarly, A1 dominates A0 for the opponent (except when I play A0), and A2 dominates A1 when I delegate.

## Step 4: Find Nash equilibrium

The pure strategy Nash equilibria:
1. **(A2, A2)**: Both delegate → both play A0 → both get 10 points
   - If I deviate to A1: I get 4 (worse)
   - If I deviate to A0: I get 2 (worse)
   - Same logic for opponent
   - This is stable!

2. **(A1, A1)**: Both get 4 points
   - But if either switches to A2 alone: still get 4
   - If both switch to A2: both get 10 (strictly better!)

## Step 5: Select optimal strategy

The payoff-dominant equilibrium is **(A2, A2)** where both players delegate and receive 10 points each. This is:
- Mutually beneficial
- Stable (Nash equilibrium)
- The mediator was proposed by me, signaling coordination intent

Since delegating is my best response when I expect a rational opponent to also delegate, and the mediator structure creates this focal point, I should delegate with probability 1.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We are Player 2 in a 2-player simultaneous game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (for Player 1, then Player 2) is:

|               | Other Player: A0 | Other Player: A1 |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| **You: A0**   | (10, 10)         | (2, 6)           |
| **You: A1**   | (20, 0)          | (4, 4)           |

As Player 2, we care about **our own points**.

This is a classic asymmetric game and not a symmetric coordination game. Let's analyze the best responses and potential equilibria.

---

### **Step 2: Best responses for Player 2 (you)**

Suppose the other player plays A0 with probability `p`, A1 with probability `1-p`.

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0:  
  `10p + 2(1 - p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2`
- If you play A1:  
  `20p + 4(1 - p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4`

Set them equal to find indifference point:
```
8p + 2 = 16p + 4
-8p = 2
p = -0.25 → not possible (probability can't be negative)
```

So, 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 for all valid p ∈ [0,1]. That means **you always prefer A1** over A0, regardless of what the other player does.

→ So **A1 is a dominant strategy for you**.

Now check what the other player is doing.

---

### **Step 3: Best responses for the other player (Player 1)**

Payoffs for Player 1:
- A0: 10q + 2(1 - q) = 8q + 2
- A1: 20q + 4(1 - q) = 16q + 4

Again, A1 dominates A0 for Player 1 too.

→ Both players have **A1 as a dominant strategy**.

So **the unique Nash equilibrium without delegation is (A1, A1)** → both get 4 points.

But wait! This seems odd. Let's double-check:

- (A1, A1): (4,4)
- (A1, A0): (20, 0) ← Player 1 gets 20, Player 2 gets 0 → bad for you
- (A0, A1): (2,6) ← you get 2
- (A0, A0): (10,10)

So if player 1 plays A0, you get 2 if you play A0, but 20 if you play A1 → so yes, A1 is better.

But from **your perspective (Player 2)**, **A1 is dominant**, so you will always play A1 in equilibrium.

So the outcome is (A1, A1) → you get **4 points**.

But can you do better via delegation?

---

### **Step 4: Delegation mechanism**

Now, you can **delegate** your move to a mediator, or act independently.

There is an **approval voting process** to select a mediator. The mediators are:

- **M1**: Proposed by Player 1  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

- **M2**: Proposed by Player 2  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So **M1 and M2 are identical in behavior**.

So both mediators have the same rule:  
- 1 delegate → A1  
- 2 delegates → A0

So the **two mediators are functionally equivalent**.

Now, the **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random** from those with the maximum number of approvals.

So your goal: **maximize your expected points**, possibly by strategically approving or not approving mediators.

But note: You are **Player 2**, and the mediators are **proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 respectively**.

This may matter for **strategic incentives**.

But first: since M1 and M2 are **identical**, your payoff from either one will be the same **if both are approved and equally selected**.

So you must ask: **do I want either or both to be approved?**

---

### **Step 5: Strategic considerations**

#### What happens in different delegation scenarios?

Let’s denote:
- D1: you delegate
- D2: the other player delegates
- M: the selected mediator (if approved)

Each mediator, if selected, plays:
- A1 if only one player delegates
- A0 if both delegate

Now, **you can decide whether to approve M1 and/or M2**.

But since M1 and M2 are **identical**, approving one or both has **no effect** on the behavior of the mediator **if the same outcome results**.

But the **selection process** matters: the winner is picked **uniformly at random from the mediators with the most approvals**.

So your approval decisions will affect the **probability** that a mediator is selected — but **only** if the approvals are unequal.

Let’s suppose:

- If you approve **only M1** → M1 gets 1 approval, M2 gets 0 → M1 is selected 100%
- If you approve **only M2** → M2 gets 1, M1 gets 0 → M2 is selected 100%
- If you approve **both** → both get 1 approval → one chosen uniformly at random → 50% each
- If you approve **neither** → nobody gets approval → but then no mediator can be selected?

Wait: what happens if **no mediator is approved**? The setup says the winning mediator is selected **from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

If both have 0 approvals → maximum is 0 → so any mediator with 0 approvals is in the set → but the rule says "selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals".

If **all have 0**, then all are tied → but only if they are approved?

No — we are to **approve** mediators. So if you approve neither, both M1 and M2 have 0 approvals → so the set of mediators with max approvals (0) is {M1, M2} → then it is selected uniformly at random → so 50% chance of each.

But this is only if **no approvals** → so both are tied.

But now: what happens if **no mediator is selected**? The rules don’t say — but since we must choose one based on approval, the only way **no mediator is selected** is if **no one approves any**, but then selection is still from max-approved group → so a mediator is still selected.

So even if you approve **none**, there is still a chance a mediator is selected.

But now: the mediator will be selected based on approvals, and then will play based on **how many players delegate**.

But **you** decide whether to **approve** or not — and **whether you delegate** is a separate decision.

Wait — **when do you decide to delegate?**

The current task is: **You must now decide which mediators to approve.**

Later, you will decide **whether to delegate**, after knowing which mediator is selected.

But the **approval vote is the first step**, and **after that**, you decide whether to delegate or not.

So your **approval strategy** must be based on what you expect to happen **in the delegation stage**, given the mediator selected.

But you are trying to **maximize your expected points** over all stages.

So we need to **simulate the full decision tree**.

But since **you are not told** how the other player will behave (in approval or delegation), you must **optimize your approval choices** **in expectation**.

But to model that, we need to assume **rationality**, and **common knowledge of rationality**.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their expected payoff.

Let’s analyze the **entire game**.

---

### **Step 6: Full game structure**

1. **Approval voting stage**:
   - You and the other player each approve some mediators (M1 and M2).
   - Then, mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the highest approval count.

2. **Delegation stage**:
   - You choose: delegate (to the selected mediator) or act independently.
   - The other player chooses the same (delegate or independent).
   - Then **if you delegate**, the mediator plays based on **how many players delegated**.
   - If you act independently, you choose your action (A0 or A1), but you will choose optimally.

Now, remember: **as a rational player, you will always choose A1 in the independent case**, because it’s dominant.

So:
- If you act independently → you play A1
- If the other player acts independently → they play A1
- If you delegate, the mediator plays:
   - A1 if only one delegate
   - A0 if both delegate

So the key is: **you can use delegation to force a different action than A1**, but at the cost of letting the mediator choose for you.

---

### **Step 7: Can delegation help you?**

Your goal: maximize your points.

In the default equilibrium without delegation, both play A1 → you get 4.

Can you get **more than 4**?

Let’s see:

- If you play A0 and other plays A0 → you get 10 → better
- If you play A0 and other plays A1 → you get 2 → worse
- If you play A1 and other plays A0 → you get 20 → awesome, but the other player won’t do that (they get 0) → so no incentive.

So the only way to get more than 4 is to **coordinate on A0**, but only if **you both play A0**.

But you get **20 if you play A1 and the other plays A0** — that’s great for you! But the other player gets 0, so they won’t agree.

So the only **Pareto-superior outcome** is (A0, A0) → (10,10), but it’s not a Nash equilibrium.

Can delegation help achieve better outcomes?

Yes — if **you delegate and the other player acts independently**, then:

- You delegate → mediator plays based on how many delegates

Case 1: Only **you** delegate → then only 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1

Other player plays independently → they play A1 (dominant) → so (A1, A1) → you get 4

Case 2: Only the **other player** delegates → you act independently → you play A1 → other player’s mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate) → so other plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4

Case 3: **Both delegate** → 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0 → so both play A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10

This is valuable — **you get 10 points** if you both delegate and the mediator plays A0.

So **coordinating on delegation and both delegating** gives you 10.

But you must **institute the risk** that the other player won’t delegate.

So now: can you **use delegation as a coordination mechanism**?

Let’s suppose the mediator is capable of coordinating on (A0, A0) **if both delegate**.

But the catch: you **don’t know** whether the other player will delegate.

But you *can* **influence the chance** of this through your **approval decisions**.

Let’s now evaluate your **approval choices**.

---

### **Step 8: What does approval do?**

- You approve M1 and/or M2.
- The selected mediator will play A1 if only 1 delegate, A0 if both.
- Since the two mediators are **identical**, it doesn’t matter which one wins — only what the **delegation decision** is.

So your approval strategy affects **how the selection of mediator happens**, but not the **behavior**.

But: if you approve both, then the selected mediator is chosen uniformly at random (50% each), but both behave the same → so irrelevant.

If you approve only one → that one is selected with 100% probability.

If you approve neither → then both have 0 approvals → so both are tied → one is selected uniformly at random → 50% each.

So in **all cases**, the **mediator is equally likely to be chosen** — but since both behave the same, it doesn't matter.

So the **only effect of your approval decision** is **whether the mediator is selected at all**, and which one is selected — but since both are the same, **your approval choice has no effect on the mediator’s behavior**.

Therefore, **your approval decisions are purely strategic in shaping the "approval landscape"**, but **since the mediators are identical, it doesn’t matter which one is selected**.

So **you are indifferent between approving M1 and M2 or both or neither** — **in terms of mediator behavior**.

But wait — could there be **strategic signaling** or **incentives for the other player**?

Yes.

Let’s suppose you **do not approve** a mediator.

But remember: the **other player** is trying to **maximize their points** too.

So they might **strategically approve mediators** to influence your behavior.

But **since both mediators are identical**, and you have control over **your** approval, you must ask: **what is the best strategy for you, assuming rational play from both sides**?

Let’s suppose both players are rational and have the same goal.

Now, suppose **you approve both mediators**.

Then:
- M1 and M2 both have 1 approval → tied → selected uniformly at random → say, M1 or M2, doesn’t matter.

So you have a mediator available.

Now, in the delegation stage, you can choose to delegate or not.

Similarly, the other player can.

Now, what happens if you **both delegate**?

→ 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → other plays A0 → payoff: (10,10)

→ You get 10 → better than 4

What if only one delegates?

→ mediator plays A1 → so the delegator plays A1

The other player (independent) plays A1 (dominant) → (A1, A1) → you get 4 → worse than 10

So: if you’re going to delegate, you **only want to do so if the other player does too**, because otherwise you end up playing A1 (if only you delegate), and the other plays A1 → you get 4.

But if **only the other player delegates**, and you don’t:
→ you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4

Same outcome.

So **delegating only when the other delegates is best — but you can’t coordinate unless you trust**.

But here’s a **coordination device** — the **mediator exists**, and the rule is symmetric.

Now: suppose you **don’t approve any mediator**.

Then:
- Both M1 and M2 get 0 approvals → max is 0 → both are included → selected uniformly at random → so a mediator is still selected.

So the same mediator behavior holds.

So **not approving any mediator still means the mediator is selected randomly, and same rules apply**.

So, **in terms of mediator availability**, it doesn’t matter — you still have the same chance of having a mediator.

But now: **if no mediator is approved**, the other player might **not approve any either**, so both mediators are selected with 50% chance.

But since they’re identical, doesn’t matter.

But now: can you **force a coordination outcome**?

Suppose you approve **only M1**, say.

Then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 0
→ M1 is selected with 100%

Same as if you approved both → M1 or M2 chosen randomly → same behavior.

So **no difference**.

But suppose you **don’t approve** any.

Then:
- M1: 0, M2: 0 → max is 0 → both are in consideration → selected uniformly at random → so a mediator is chosen.

So the mediator is still **available**.

So in **all cases**, the **mediator is present**.

The **only thing that changes** is whether the selected mediator is **M1 or M2**, but since they behave the same, it doesn't affect the game.

So **your approval decision has no effect on the mediator’s behavior**.

Therefore, **your payoff does not depend on your approval choice** — only on whether you and the other player delegate.

But the **other player** might **strategically approve** to influence your **delegation decision**.

But since both mediators are identical, and the selection is random when tied, the other player’s approval has no strategic value either.

Wait — let's suppose you are about to decide whether to **delegate**.

The mediator, if selected, will play:
- A1 if 1 delegate
- A0 if 2 delegates

So if you **trust** the other player to delegate, you might want to.

But you can’t be sure.

Suppose you both **know** that if both delegate, you get 10.

But if only you delegate, you get 4.

Similarly for the other player: if both delegate, they get 10; if only they delegate, they get 4.

So this is a **coordination game** with two equilibria:
- (delegate, delegate) → (10,10)
- (independent, independent) → (4,4)

But (A1,A1) is the default.

Now, **can you use the mediator to coordinate on (A0,A0)?**

Yes.

But only if you **both delegate**.

But how to **coordinate**? You need a **common expectation** that the other will delegate.

But the **mediator** is a coordination device.

However: there is a **risk**.

Suppose you **delegate**, but the other **doesn’t**.

Then:
- You delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Other plays independently → plays A1 → outcome: (A1,A1) → you get 4

But if you had acted independently, you would have played A1 anyway → so same thing.

So **no cost** to delegating if the other doesn’t — you still end up with A1.

But also **no benefit**.

Only when **both** delegate do you get better (10).

So **you should delegate only if you believe the other player will too**.

But is there an **equilibrium** where both delegate?

Yes.

Suppose both players **believe** that the other will delegate.

Then:
- If you both delegate → you both get 10
- If you deviate and don’t delegate, then:
   - You play A1
   - Other delegate → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1
   - You get 4 < 10 → worse

So **you are better off delegating** if you expect the other to.

So (delegate, delegate) is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Similarly, (independent, independent) is also an equilibrium: if both play A1, then deviating to delegate gives you 4 anyway (since other plays A1, you’re the only delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get 4), so no gain.

So **(delegate, delegate)** and **(independent, independent)** are both equilibria.

But (delegate, delegate) gives you 10 > 4 → so it’s **Pareto superior**.

Now, **can you coordinate on the better equilibrium?**

Yes — by having **a mediator**, and by **approving it**, you can **signal your intention**.

But since the mediators are **identical**, and approval doesn’t affect behavior, your approval choice **only matters for whether the mediator exists** — but it does exist in all cases.

Wait — **what if you approve NO mediators?**

Then both M1 and M2 have 0 approvals → but the **maximum number is 0**, so both are eligible → one is selected uniformly at random → **mediator is still selected**.

So **a mediator is always selected**.

Therefore, **no matter what you approve, the mediator is available**.

So your **approvals have no effect on whether the mediator exists or what it does**.

So **your approval choice is irrelevant**.

But you must **submit a vote**.

And you must **maximize your expected points**.

But since the mediator is always selected, and identical, your approval decision has **no effect on the game outcome**.

Therefore, you can choose **any approval pattern** — you are indifferent.

But the question is: **what is the best thing to do?**

But wait — could there be a **strategic reason** to **not approve a mediator**?

For example, if you **don’t approve**, and the other player **does**, then perhaps that **changes incentives**?

But since both mediators are identical, and the selection is fair, nothing changes.

Alternatively, suppose you **approve both** — then you have a 50% chance of M1, 50% of M2.

But since behavior is same, irrelevant.

So **no matter what**, the mediator is available and behaves the same.

So **your approval choice has no effect on your expected payoff**.

But the **other player** might try to **force you to delegate** by approving a mediator.

But since you are rational, and you know that:
- If both delegate → you get 10
- If only you delegate → you get 4
- If you don’t — you get 4 regardless of others

So you **will only delegate if you believe the other player will too**.

So if the other player approves a mediator, it doesn’t change your payoff, but it **might signal** their willingness to coordinate.

But since the mediator behavior is the same, **it doesn't matter which one is selected**.

So **you should approve both** — because:
- It doesn't hurt
- It ensures that you are **not excluded** from the mediator selection
- It doesn't reduce your chance of having a mediator

But suppose you **don’t approve any**, then both mediators are tied — still selected.

No difference.

But what if the **other player** approves both?

Then:
- M1: 1 (by them), M2: 1 (by them) → tied
- You have 0 → so max is 1 → M1 and M2 are selected with 50% each → still mediator available

Suppose **you approve one**, other approves one → same

Suppose **you approve neither**, other approves both → then both have 1 → selected uniformly → still OK

So **mediator is always available**, always same behavior.

Thus, **your approval choice is irrelevant**.

But you must choose.

So the **only thing that matters** is your **delegation decision**.

But for the **approval stage**, since it doesn't affect payoff, you can **choose any**.

But the question is: **you want to maximize your points**.

Since all approval choices lead to **same mediator behavior**, and same delegation equilibrium, you are indifferent.

But perhaps **approving both** maximizes the **chance** that the mediator is selected — but it’s always selected.

Wait: only if **no one approves any**, then **both have 0** — max is 0 — so both are selected.

So even if no one approves, a mediator is selected.

So **mediator is always selected**.

Therefore, your approval choice has **no effect on the game**.

So you can approve both, or neither, or one — all give same outcome.

But perhaps **approving both** is safest — you don't risk being excluded.

But you can't be excluded — since if you approve 0, and others approve 0, it's still selected.

So no risk.

Therefore, **your approval choice has no strategic effect**.

But since the question requires a decision, and you must **maximize your expected points**, and all choices are equivalent, you should choose a **safe and neutral** option.

But let’s consider: **if you approve both, and the other player approves both,** then max approvals is 2 → both are selected uniformly → 50-50.

Same as if you approve only one.

But now, if you approve only one, and the other player approves only the other, then:
- M1: 1 (you), M2: 1 (other) → tied → selected uniformly → same

So the same result.

Thus, **no difference**.

But here’s a twist: **Mediator is proposed by Player 1 and Player 2**.

Could that affect **signaling**?

If you **approve M1**, which is proposed by Player 1, you might be seen as aligning with them.

But since both mediators are identical, and you are rational, **you don’t care**.

But suppose you **disapprove M2**, which is proposed by Player 2 — yourself? No, you are Player 2, so M2 is proposed by yourself.

Wait: M2 is proposed by Player 2.

You are Player 2.

So **M2 is YOUR proposal**.

So you **might want to approve it**, as it reflects your own proposal.

But does that matter?

Not really — because behavior is same.

But if you **disapprove it**, and you're Player 2, that’s **self-deprecating**.

But since the behavior is identical, **you have no reason to disapprove M2**.

Similarly, M1 is proposed by Player 1 — you may not trust them.

But again, behavior is same.

So **no reason to disapprove either**.

Therefore, **you should approve both**, to maximize your control.

But since it doesn’t matter, **you can approve both**.

Alternatively, you might **think** that if you approve both, and the other player also approves both, then the mediator is still selected — same as if you approve one.

But you are indifferent.

But **approving both is safe** — no risk of being excluded.

But you are never excluded.

So still.

But perhaps **the rule is**: if no mediator is approved, then **no mediator can be selected**?

Let’s check the problem:

> "The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

If **no mediator has any approvals**, then **all mediators have 0 approvals**, which is the maximum — so they are all eligible — so one is selected uniformly.

So **mediator is still selected**.

Therefore, **no risk**.

Thus, **any approval choice is equivalent**.

But you must pick one.

So what should you do?

Since **M2 is your own proposal** (you are Player 2), and you are rational, **you should approve it** — it reflects your own idea.

Similarly, **M1** is proposed by Player 1 — you might have no reason to approve it, but no reason to disapprove.

But if you disapprove M1, you don’t gain anything.

But since you **can** approve it and nothing is lost, **approve both**.

Moreover, since both are identical, **you have no incentive to disapprove either**.

Therefore, **approve both**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

You should approve both mediators, since:
- They behave identically.
- Your approval choice does not affect the outcome.
- Approving both is safe and reflects full support for the coordination mechanism.
- There is no penalty for approving either.
- You are rational and want to maximize expected points — all choices yield same expected payoff, so approving both is reasonable.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
Let's approach this step by step, considering both the game dynamics and the approval voting system for mediators.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are Player 2, and we play simultaneously with Player 1.

Actions: A0 or A1  
Payoffs (Player 2’s points in each cell):

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 (Player 1) | A1 (Player 1) |
|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **A0**                        | 10             | 2              |
| **A1**                        | 20             | 4              |

This is a **non-symmetric** game. Let's analyze best responses.

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You get 10 for A0, 20 for A1 → **Best: A1**
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You get 2 for A0, 4 for A1 → **Best: A1**

So **A1 is a dominant strategy** for you as Player 2.

Similarly, check for Player 1 (not our focus, but relevant for outcomes):

| Player 1's Action \ Your Action (Player 2) | A0 | A1 |
|---------------------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                                          | 10 | 0  |
| A1                                          | 6  | 4  |

If you play A0, Player 1 prefers A0 (10 > 6)  
If you play A1, Player 1 prefers A1 (4 > 0) — so **A1 is dominant** for Player 1 too.

Thus, **(A1, A1)** is the unique **Nash equilibrium** — both players playing A1 → you get 4 points.

But we are not limited to playing alone — we can **delegate** to a mediator.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

- You can choose to **delegate** your move to a mediator.
- The mediator will play based on **how many players have delegated to it**.
- Only **one** mediator will be selected, the one with the **most approvals**, chosen **uniformly at random** among those tied for the most approvals.

**Important**: You are trying to **maximize your expected points**.

You have two choices:
1. **Act independently** (play a strategy, either pure or mixed).
2. **Delegate** to a mediator — which will then play based on the number of delegates.

You can approve (or not) mediators **before** the approval voting.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Two Mediator Proposals**

Both mediators are **identical** in behavior:

- **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**:
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

- **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**:
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So **M1 and M2 are functionally identical**.

They do the same thing, just with different proposers.

So from a **behavioral standpoint**, they are **indistinguishable**.

---

### **Step 4: Predict Outcomes Based on Delegation**

Let’s consider possible delegation scenarios and their outcomes.

#### **Case 1: No one delegates (you act independently)**

Then you play A1 (dominant), Player 1 plays A1 → both get 4 points.

But if both play A1, you get 4 — but **could you do better?**

Wait — if you play A1 and Player 1 plays A0, you get 20 — that’s better.

But Player 1's dominant strategy is A1 — so Player 1 will never play A0 unless they expect you to play A0.

But if you're playing A1, Player 1 sees that you're playing A1 → they prefer A1 (4) over A0 (0).

So (A1, A1) is stable.

Thus, independent play leads to **4 points**.

#### **Case 2: You delegate to a mediator, and Player 1 does not**

- Only one delegate (you)
- The mediator plays **A1** (per both M1 and M2 rules)
- So you get A1, Player 1 plays A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get **4 points**

Wait — that’s **worse** than if you had played A1 yourself? No — same.

But same as independent play. Not better.

But no gain.

#### **Case 3: You delegate, and Player 1 also delegates to the same mediator**

- Two delegates → mediator plays **A0**
- So your action is A0, Player 1’s action is A0 → outcome: (A0, A0) → you get **10 points**

That’s **better** than 4.

So **if both delegate and the mediator plays A0**, you get 10.

But is this likely?

It depends on whether both players will delegate — and whether they expect this.

But **you control your approval** of mediators.

The mediator’s behavior is fixed.

So **if both players delegate to the same mediator**, then mediator plays A0 (since two delegates), and you get 10.

If only one delegates, you get 4.

Now, what does Player 1 want?

Let’s consider **Player 1’s incentives**.

Player 1:
- If they play A0, and you play A0 → 10
- If they play A0, and you play A1 → 0
- If they play A1, and you play A0 → 6
- If they play A1, and you play A1 → 4

So Player 1’s best response:
- If you play A0 → A0 (10 > 6)
- If you play A1 → A1 (4 > 0)

So again, **A1 is dominant for Player 1**.

So naturally, Player 1 will play A1 unless they believe you will play A0.

But if they delegate, and both delegate, then the mediator plays A0 — so **you play A0**, and Player 1 plays A0 → they get 10.

That’s **better** than playing A1 (which gives them 4).

So **Player 1 has incentive to delegate** — because if both delegate, they get 10 instead of 4.

Similarly, you get 10 if both delegate vs. only 4 if you don’t delegate or if only one delegates.

So both players **benefit from mutual delegation**.

But the key is: **Can you coordinate?**

No direct communication. But the **approval voting** mechanism is a **coordinating device**.

You **approve mediators** in advance, and the winning mediator is selected at random from those with the **most approvals**.

So **you can maximize your chance of a good outcome** by encouraging high approval.

---

### **Step 5: Should You Approve the Mediators?**

We have two identical mediators: M1 and M2.

They have the same behavior.

**If you approve both**, then:
- If Player 1 also approves both → both have 2 approvals → both are tied → winning mediator chosen at random → equally likely to be M1 or M2.
- But both are identical → no difference.

So **if both approve both**, then both mediators are eligible, and one is selected at random.

But since they behave the same way, it doesn’t matter.

Then the game proceeds with **delegation**.

Now, **if both players delegate to the same mediator**, outcome is:
- Two delegates → mediator plays A0
- So you play A0, Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10

But does **Player 1** have incentive to approve and delegate?

Yes — as we saw:
- If they delegate and you delegate, they get 10.
- If they don’t delegate, they play independently → they play A1 → you play A1 (since you also play A1) → they get 4.

So 10 > 4 → Player 1 prefers to delegate **if they believe you will delegate**.

But can this be coordinated?

Yes — through **approval voting**.

But you must approve the mediator to give it a chance to win.

Suppose you **do not approve** either.

Then no mediator wins → delegation cannot happen → both must play independently → (A1, A1) → you get 4.

But if you **approve both**, and Player 1 also approves both, then there’s a chance that a mediator is selected → and if both delegate, outcome is A0,A0 → you get 10.

So **you gain by approving both, as long as Player 1 also approves**.

But you don’t know what Player 1 will do.

But since the mediators are **symmetric**, and presumably Player 1 may be rational, they will **also want** to approve the mediators — because the mediator gives them a way to coordinate on (A0,A0).

So mutual delegation leads to **mutual benefit**: both get 10.

But wait — for Player 1:

- If they delegate and both delegate → they get 10
- If they don’t delegate → they play A1, you play A1 → they get 4
- So they prefer to delegate if they believe you will

Similarly, **you** get 10 if both delegate, vs 4 if not.

So both have incentive to **approve** the mediator.

So if **you approve both**, and **Player 1 approves both**, then both mediators are tied for max approval → one is chosen at random → then both players jointly delegate to it → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 10.

That’s better than 4.

So your **expected payoff** increases if you approve both.

But what if **you approve only one**?

Then:
- If Player 1 approves the same one → that mediator has 2 approvals → wins.
- Then both can delegate → same outcome: you get 10.

- If Player 1 approves the *other* → then both have 1 approval → tied → random selection → but still, if both delegate, outcome is same → you get 10.

Wait — actually, **as long as both approve at least one mediator**, and there is **common approval**, then **if both delegate**, we will end up with a mediator (the one selected), and since two delegates, it plays A0 → outcome is (A0,A0).

The only risk is if **only one player approves**, or if they approve different mediators and only one total approval, etc.

But if you approve both, you **maximize the chance** that the mediator is selected and that Player 1 can coordinate.

In fact, **approving both is safe and maximally inclusive**.

Is there any downside?

Suppose you approve only M1, and Player 1 approves only M2.

Then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 1 approval
- Both tied → random selection → say M1 is chosen.
- Then both players delegate? Well, both approved different mediators, but the **system selects one at random**.

But if the selected mediator is M1, then **only you** approved it → so **you** can delegate to it? Or do you need to **agree**?

Wait — **the rules say**:

> "On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator."

And:

> "the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So: **you can delegate only to the winning mediator**.

But **must the other player also agree**?

The text says: "you will have the option to delegate" — so delegating is **your choice**.

But the mediator will play your action based on number of delegates.

So **you can delegate even if the other player doesn’t**.

But **only if you approve the winning mediator**.

So you can **delegate unilaterally**.

But the mediator’s action depends on **how many players delegate**.

So even if you delegate and Player 1 does not, only **one delegate** → medaltor plays A1 → you get A1.

But if Player 1 also delegates (to the same mediator), then two delegates → plays A0.

So **both can delegate independently**, as long as they both approve the winning mediator.

Here’s the key point:

> "The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

Then, **both players can choose to delegate to it**, even if they didn’t approve it? No — you can only delegate **if you approved it**, because the mediator is selected **from those approved**.

Wait — how?

The system runs:
1. You and the other player **approve mediators**.
2. Winner is selected (from max-approval group).
3. Then, each player **decides whether to delegate to the winning mediator**.

So **approval only determines eligibility**, not binding.

So for example:
- You approve M1 and M2.
- Player 1 approves only M1.
- Then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

Then, you can choose to delegate to M1 or not.

Player 1 can choose to delegate to M1 or not.

So **delegation decisions are separate**.

Therefore, **to get the two-delegate outcome**, **both players must choose to delegate**.

Now, in this case, both players want to get the **A0,A0** outcome (10 each).

So both will **prefer** to delegate **if** they believe the other will.

But if you approve both, your **options are open**.

But if you approve only one, and it's not the one Player 1 approves, you might not be able to coordinate.

But if you approve both, then **even if Player 1 approves only one**, the winning mediator might be M1 (if Player 1 approves M1), and **you can still delegate**, since you approved M1.

So **you are always able to delegate to the winning mediator** if you approved it.

Therefore, **approving both mediators maximizes your flexibility**.

It ensures that **no matter which mediator wins**, you are **eligible to delegate**.

Similarly, if Player 1 approves both, same for them.

Now, **what is your expected payoff if you approve both?**

- Suppose both approve both → then the winning mediator is random (M1 or M2) — doesn't matter.
- Then, both players choose whether to delegate.
- If both delegate → outcome: A0,A0 → you get 10.
- If only one delegates → outcome: A1, A1 → you get 4 (since mediator plays A1 if 1 delegate).
- If neither delegates → both play independently → (A1,A1) → you get 4.

So both players have an incentive to **delegate to the mediator**, because:
- If they delegate and the other delegates → get 10
- If they don’t delegate → get 4
- 10 > 4 → so **both will prefer to delegate** if they believe the other will.

So **they can coordinate on mutual delegation**.

Thus, **expected outcome**: mutual delegation occurs → you get 10.

If you **only approve one**, say M1:
- If Player 1 approves only M2 → then M1 and M2 tied → random winner.
- If M1 wins → you can delegate, but Player 1 cannot (didn’t approve) → so only you can delegate → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 4.
- If M2 wins → you did not approve M2 → so you cannot delegate → you play independently → A1 → Player 1 (if they delegate to M2) plays A1 → outcome (A1,A1) → you get 4.

So in **both cases**, you get only 4 if only one person approves.

If you approve only M1, and Player 1 approves only M1 → then M1 wins → both can delegate → mutual delegation → you get 10.

But the **chance** of coordination depends on both approving the same one.

If both approve both, **no matter what Player 1 does**, **you are always able to delegate** if they do.

Thus, by approving **both**, you **encourage coordination**.

Moreover, since **both mediators are identical**, there is **no reason not to approve both**.

Approving both:
- Gives you the **same** coordination possibility as approving one, but **in more cases**.
- Eliminates the risk of being blocked by misalignment in approval.

Therefore, **approving both mediators** is **strictly better**.

Additionally, **if you approve none**, then **no mediator wins** → no delegation possible → you must play independently → (A1,A1) → you get 4.

That’s worse than 10.

So you **must** approve at least one.

And since both are identical, you should **approve both**.

---

### **Final Decision: Approve both mediators?**

Yes.

- Both mediators behave identically.
- Approving both maximizes your chance of being able to delegate and coordinate on the beneficial outcome.
- It gives you flexibility and removes the risk of approval mismatch.
- It increases expected payoff from 4 (independent play) to 10 (if both delegate).
- Since both players are motivated to delegate, mutual delegation is likely.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without Delegation**

We are Player 2. The game is a simultaneous-move 2-player game with actions A0 and A1, and we're to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (possibly including A2: Delegate to Mediator).

The payoff matrix (from **Player 2's perspective**) is:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 10     | 2      |
| **P2: A1** | 20     | 4      |

But this matrix depends on what Player 1 does. However, we have a **twist**: we can choose to **delegate** our move to a mediator.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

- **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**
- The mediator acts based on **how many players** delegate to it.
- The mediator is proposed by Player 1 and approved by both — so it's a shared mechanism.
- The mediator’s behavior:
  - If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
  - If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Note:
- If **no one** delegates, then both players play independently (A0 or A1 as chosen).
- If **only you** delegate → mediator plays A1 for you.
- If **both you and Player 1** delegate → mediator plays A0 for you.

Let’s define:
- Your choice: A0, A1, or A2 (Delegate)
- Player 1’s choice: A0, A1, or A2 (Delegate)

So we must consider **three total scenarios** depending on how many delegate.

---

### **Step 3: Consider All Possible Delegation Scenarios**

Let’s denote your action choice as a probability distribution over A0, A1, A2. Similarly, Player 1 chooses their own.

But since we don't know Player 1’s strategy, we must **assume rational play** — i.e., we choose a strategy that maximizes our **expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 is rational and will also choose optimally.

Therefore, we are looking for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies, including the delegation option.

But to make it tractable, let’s analyze the strategic incentives.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Outcomes by Delegation Choices**

Let’s denote:
- Your action: you choose A0, A1, or A2 with probabilities p0, p1, p2 (p0 + p1 + p2 = 100)

But since Player 1 is rational and symmetric in strategy, we can attempt to find a symmetric equilibrium or consider dominant strategies.

Let’s suppose **Player 1 is rational** and will also choose a best response to our strategy.

But since we're only deciding our own strategy (and Player 1 will react optimally), we assume a symmetric game? Not necessarily — the mediator was proposed by Player 1, so there could be asymmetry.

But let’s suppose **both players are rational and self-interested**, and both are choosing their actions optimally.

We can look for a **symmetric equilibrium**, or more likely, **a best response to rational play**, especially since the mediator is fixed.

Let’s instead analyze **expected payoffs under each delegation configuration** and decide whether delegation is a good idea.

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate Delegation Based on Player 1's Likely Actions**

Let’s suppose we consider delegation (A2) as a strategy. We must evaluate whether it increases our expected payoff.

Let’s examine the **possible cases** based on Player 1’s choice.

---

#### **Case 1: Player 1 does NOT delegate**

So Player 1 plays A0 or A1.

Then:
- If **you delegate**, 1 player (you) delegates → mediator plays A1 for **you**
- So your action becomes A1
- Player 1 plays A0 or A1 → so your payoff is:
  - If P1 plays A0: you play A1 vs P1 A0 → you get **20**
  - If P1 plays A1: you play A1 vs P1 A1 → you get **4**

So your **expected payoff from delegating**, given P1 doesn't delegate, is:
- 20 ⋅ P(P1 plays A0) + 4 ⋅ P(P1 plays A1)

But if you were to **play A1 yourself**, your payoff would be:
- 20 (if P1 plays A0)
- 4 (if P1 plays A1) → same

So **if P1 doesn't delegate**, delegating gives you the same payoff as playing A1 **directly**, because:
- Mediator plays A1 when only you delegate.

So delegating **mirrors** playing A1, in this case.

But only **if** you expect Player 1 not to delegate.

Now let’s consider:

---

#### **Case 2: Player 1 ALSO delegates**

Then 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0 for **you** (and for P1)

So your action is A0.

Player 1’s action is A0 (since mediator plays A0 for them too).

So outcome: both A0 → you get **10 points**

Compare that to if you had played A0 yourself: same.

But what if you had played A1? Then you’d get 20 if P1 plays A0 — but **in this case P1 is playing A0 (because mediator plays A0)**, so you’d get 20 — better than 10.

Wait — so **if Player 1 delegates, then you get only 10 if you delegate, but could get 20 if you play A1 yourself**

So **delegating is bad in this case**

But if you delegate, and P1 delegates, then you are forced to A0 → you get 10.

But if you **room hand** and play A1, you get 20.

So in this case, **delegating is harmful**.

---

### **Step 6: Incentive Conflict**

- If **only you** delegate → mediator plays A1 for you.
- So you act like you played A1.
- If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 for both → you get 10 (instead of possibly 20 if you played A1)

So > You gain if you delegate **only when Player 1 does not delegate**, but lose if they do.

But you **cannot control** whether Player 1 delegates.

So delegation is risky.

But here's a key insight:

> The **mediator’s behavior is based on number of delegators**, so if you delegate, you **reduce your own agency**.

But maybe **delegation is a credible commitment**?

Wait — let’s consider that **Player 1** is also rational and may consider delegation.

Suppose **Player 1** is rational and realizes that:
- If **both delegate**, then both play A0 → both get 10
- If **only you delegate**, then you play A1, P1 can play A0 → P1 gets 0 (if you play A1, they play A0), which is bad for them.
- If **only Player 1 delegates**, then they play A1 (since only one delegate), so they get high payoff if you play A0.

But **you** care about your own payoff.

Let’s try to find a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**, assuming both players are rational.

But let’s instead think: **is delegation ever a dominant strategy?**

No — because it depends on the other player.

But let’s suppose **both players delegate**.

Then both play A0 → both get 10.

But if you had played A1 instead, and Player 1 still plays A0 (because they delegated), then you would get 20 — better.

So **both delegating is bad** — both get 10, but could get 20 if you played A1 instead (while they play A0).

So **both delegating is inefficient and suboptimal**.

But if Player 1 **does NOT delegate**, and you do, then you play A1, and Player 1 plays A0 or A1.

If Player 1 plays A0, you get 20 — great.

So **you prefer to delegate only if Player 1 does not**.

But if Player 1 sees that you might delegate, they might play A0 to avoid getting 0.

But let’s model this.

---

### **Step 7: Break Down Payoffs Based on Delegation Decisions**

Let’s suppose Player 1 uses a strategy: they delegate with probability q.

We (Player 2) choose a probability r to delegate, and play A0 or A1 with certain probs.

But to find equilibrium, we can suppose a candidate strategy.

Let’s suppose **both players play a mixed strategy where they delegate with some probability**, or perhaps **one delegates**, the other doesn’t.

But here’s a key insight:

> Player 1 controls the mediator, so they might have an incentive to get more than you.

But no — the mediator’s behavior is fixed: only number of delegators matters.

So both players have **incentive to avoid both delegating**, because that forces both to A0.

But if **only one delegates**, the delegatee gets A1.

So each player wants to **be the only one to delegate**, so they can get A1 and exploit the other player playing A0.

But if both try to be the only one, they both end up **delegating together**, and both get A0 — which is bad.

So this is like a **"battle of the sexes"** or **competition to be the only delegate**.

It’s similar to a **"stalemate" or "coordination game"**.

Wait — think of this:

- If **you delegate**, and Player 1 **does not**, then you get A1 → you can get 20 if P1 plays A0.
- If **you do not delegate**, and P1 **does**, then P1 plays A1 → you get 2 if you play A0, or 4 if you play A1.
- But if **both delegate**, both get A0 → you get 10.
- If **neither**, you choose freely.

So — **your payoff depends on who delegates**.

Let’s suppose that **both players know** that if both delegate, they get 10 each.

But if only one delegates, that player gets A1 → and if the other plays A0, they get 20.

The other player gets 0 in that case — bad.

So both players **do not want to be the one not delegating when the other delegates**.

But they both **want to be the only delegate** — which gives them A1 and can exploit P1 playing A0.

So it’s a **race to be the only delegate**.

But if both try, they both end up delegating — which is bad.

So **both prefer to be the only delegate**.

But if both try to delegate, they both get 10.

So there is **no dominant strategy**.

Let’s suppose both players are symmetric and rational — so they might randomize.

Suppose both players use the same mixed strategy: delegate with probability p.

Then:

- Probability both delegate: p² → both play A0 → you get 10
- Probability only you delegate: p(1−p) → you play A1, P1 plays whatever they would play if not delegating
- Probability only P1 delegates: (1−p)p → you play your own action, P1 plays A1
- Probability neither: (1−p)² → both choose A0/A1

But in the cases where **not delegating**, the players must choose their own actions.

So to solve this fully, we need to define **what actions each player takes if they do NOT delegate**.

Let’s suppose that when a player does **not delegate**, they choose A0 or A1 based on their best response.

So now we need to define a **consistent strategy profile**.

Let’s try to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

---

### **Step 8: Try to Assume Symmetric Equilibrium**

Assume **both players use the same mixed strategy**: delegate with probability p, and if not delegating, they play A0 with probability q, A1 with probability 1−q.

But that’s a lot of variables.

Alternatively, maybe **delegation is not worth it** — because of the risk.

Wait — let’s think differently.

What if **delegation is never optimal**?

Let’s compare pure strategies.

---

### **Step 9: Evaluate Pure Strategy Payoffs (Without Delegation)**

Suppose we play A0 or A1, and Player 1 does the same.

The game without delegation is a classic coordination/defection game.

Let’s find the dominant strategies.

From **Player 2's perspective**:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You play A0 → 10
  - You play A1 → 20 → better
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You play A0 → 2
  - You play A1 → 4 → better

So A1 is **strictly better** than A0 regardless of Player 1’s action.

So A1 **dominates** A0.

Therefore, **in the absence of delegation, Player 2 should always play A1**.

And since Player 1 is symmetric? Wait — is the game symmetric?

Let’s check.

Player 1’s payoffs:

- P1 A0, P2 A0: 10
- P1 A0, P2 A1: 0
- P1 A1, P2 A0: 6
- P1 A1, P2 A1: 4

So for Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 should play A0 (10 > 6)
- If P2 plays A1: P1 should play A1 (4 > 0)

So P1 plays A0 if P2 plays A0, A1 if P2 plays A1 → best response is to **match** P2.

Player 2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0: play A1 → 20 > 10
- If P1 plays A1: play A1 → 4 > 2

So Player 2 always wants to play A1.

So the unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies is:
- P1: play A1
- P2: play A1
→ both get 4

But is that the only equilibrium?

Another NE: both play A0 — then if you deviate to A1, you get 20 — better.

So A0,A0 is not NE.

Only NE is (A1, A1)

So **if both play independently**, the equilibrium is both play A1 → you get 4.

---

### **Step 10: Now Consider Delegation**

Can **delegation improve your payoff**?

Suppose you delegate.

Then:
- If **Player 1 does NOT delegate**, then **you** play A1 (mediator plays A1 when only one delegate)
- And Player 1 plays A1 (since A1 is dominant for P1)
- So you play A1, P1 plays A1 → you get **4**

But if you had played A1 yourself, same result → **no gain**

- If **Player 1 DELEGATES**, then two delegates → mediator plays A0 for you → you play A0
- Player 1 plays A0
- So both play A0 → you get **10**

But if you had played A1 yourself, and P1 is delegating → P1 plays A0 → you would have played A1 → you get **20**

So you get **10** from delegating, but could get **20** if you played A1 instead.

So **delegating is worse when Player 1 delegates**

But what if Player 1 delegates?

They would only delegate if it’s rational for them.

Now, **is delegation rational for Player 1?**

Let’s see Player 1’s perspective.

If you delegate, and P1 does NOT delegate:
- You play A1
- P1 can play A0 or A1
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 0
- If P1 plays A1 → P1 gets 4

So P1 should play A1 → you get 20, P1 gets 4.

If you **do NOT delegate**, and P1 delegates:
- P1 plays A1
- You play your own action
- If you play A1 → you get 4, P1 gets 4
- If you play A0 → you get 2, P1 gets 6

So P1 prefers you to play A1 → so you will play A1.

So if P1 delegates, you play A1 → both get 4

Now, if both delegate:
- Both play A0 → both get 10

So for P1:
- If only you delegate → P1 uses A1 → gets 4
- If only P1 delegates → P1 gets A1, you play A1 → P1 gets 4
- If both delegate → P1 gets 10
- If neither → both play A1 → P1 gets 4

So P1 gets **10** only if both delegate — otherwise 4.

So for P1, **delegation is beneficial** only if **both delegate**, because then they get 10 instead of 4.

So P1 has incentive to delegate **if they believe you will also delegate**.

Similarly, you get 10 if both delegate, but 20 if you play A1 and they play A0.

But if you delegate, and P1 delegates, you get 10.

But if you play A1 and P1 plays A0, you get 20.

But if you play A1, and P1 delegates → P1 plays A0 → so you get 20.

So **if you play A1 yourself, and P1 delegates, you get 20**

But if you delegate and P1 delegates, you get 10.

So **you prefer not to delegate when P1 delegates**, because you can get 20 instead of 10.

But if P1 does NOT delegate, and you delegate, you play A1 → same as if you played A1 yourself → you get 20 if P1 plays A0, 4 if P1 plays A1.

But P1 plays A1 anyway.

So you get 4 either way.

So **delegating gives you 10 if P1 delegates, but 4 if P1 does not** (same as playing A1 directly).

But if P1 does not delegate, your payoff is 4 in both cases.

If P1 delegates, **delegating gives you 10**, but **not delegating gives you 20

response:
First rewrite what “Delegate (A2)” actually does in terms of the realized action:

- If I play **A2** and the other player does **not** play A2, then only 1 player delegated ⇒ mediator plays **A1** for me.
- If both of us play **A2**, then 2 players delegated ⇒ mediator plays **A0** for both.

So from my perspective, the relevant outcomes involving A2 are:
- (A2, A0) behaves like (A1, A0) ⇒ I get **6**
- (A2, A1) behaves like (A1, A1) ⇒ I get **4**
- (A2, A2) behaves like (A0, A0) ⇒ I get **10**

Now check incentives:
- If the other player chooses **A2**, then my payoffs are:
  - choose A0 ⇒ 0
  - choose A1 ⇒ 4
  - choose A2 ⇒ 10  (best)
- Symmetrically, if I choose **A2**, the other player’s best reply is also **A2** (it gives them 10 instead of 4 or 2).

Therefore, (A2, A2) is a strict Nash equilibrium and gives me the highest stable payoff (10). So I should delegate with probability 1.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix
From my perspective as Player 2:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A1, A0): I get 0  
- (A0, A1): I get 2
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Understanding the Mediator
- If only I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me
- If both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both (we both get 10)
- If only Player 1 delegates: Mediator plays A1 for them

## Step 3: Analyzing Player 1's Incentives
Let me check Player 1's payoffs to predict their behavior:
- If I play A0: Player 1 gets 10 from A0 vs 6 from A1
- If I play A1: Player 1 gets 20 from A0 vs 4 from A1

Player 1 always prefers A0 over A1 regardless of my choice.

Now comparing A0 vs A2 (delegation) for Player 1:
- If I play A0 and Player 1 plays A0: Player 1 gets 10
- If I play A0 and Player 1 delegates: Player 1 plays A1 (via mediator), gets 6
- If I delegate and Player 1 plays A0: I play A1 (via mediator), Player 1 gets 20
- If I delegate and Player 1 delegates: Both play A0 (via mediator), Player 1 gets 10

Player 1 prefers A0 to A2 in all scenarios since A0 guarantees at least 10, while A2 could give 6.

## Step 4: My Best Response
If Player 1 plays A0 (which is their dominant strategy):
- My A0 gives: 10
- My A1 gives: 0
- My A2 gives: 0 (mediator plays A1 for me with only 1 delegation)

I should clearly play A0.

## Step 5: Checking Nash Equilibrium
At (A0, A0):
- I get 10; deviating to A1 gives 0, deviating to A2 gives 0 → No profitable deviation
- Player 1 gets 10; deviating to A1 gives 6, deviating to A2 gives 6 → No profitable deviation

This is a Nash equilibrium and the rational outcome.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0, "A2": 0}

Your previous response was:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without Delegation**

We are Player 2. The game is a simultaneous-move 2-player game with actions A0 and A1, and we're to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (possibly including A2: Delegate to Mediator).

The payoff matrix (from **Player 2's perspective**) is:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 10     | 2      |
| **P2: A1** | 20     | 4      |

But this matrix depends on what Player 1 does. However, we have a **twist**: we can choose to **delegate** our move to a mediator.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

- **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**
- The mediator acts based on **how many players** delegate to it.
- The mediator is proposed by Player 1 and approved by both — so it's a shared mechanism.
- The mediator’s behavior:
  - If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
  - If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Note:
- If **no one** delegates, then both players play independently (A0 or A1 as chosen).
- If **only you** delegate → mediator plays A1 for you.
- If **both you and Player 1** delegate → mediator plays A0 for you.

Let’s define:
- Your choice: A0, A1, or A2 (Delegate)
- Player 1’s choice: A0, A1, or A2 (Delegate)

So we must consider **three total scenarios** depending on how many delegate.

---

### **Step 3: Consider All Possible Delegation Scenarios**

Let’s denote your action choice as a probability distribution over A0, A1, A2. Similarly, Player 1 chooses their own.

But since we don't know Player 1’s strategy, we must **assume rational play** — i.e., we choose a strategy that maximizes our **expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 is rational and will also choose optimally.

Therefore, we are looking for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies, including the delegation option.

But to make it tractable, let’s analyze the strategic incentives.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Outcomes by Delegation Choices**

Let’s denote:
- Your action: you choose A0, A1, or A2 with probabilities p0, p1, p2 (p0 + p1 + p2 = 100)

But since Player 1 is rational and symmetric in strategy, we can attempt to find a symmetric equilibrium or consider dominant strategies.

Let’s suppose **Player 1 is rational** and will also choose a best response to our strategy.

But since we're only deciding our own strategy (and Player 1 will react optimally), we assume a symmetric game? Not necessarily — the mediator was proposed by Player 1, so there could be asymmetry.

But let’s suppose **both players are rational and self-interested**, and both are choosing their actions optimally.

We can look for a **symmetric equilibrium**, or more likely, **a best response to rational play**, especially since the mediator is fixed.

Let’s instead analyze **expected payoffs under each delegation configuration** and decide whether delegation is a good idea.

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate Delegation Based on Player 1's Likely Actions**

Let’s suppose we consider delegation (A2) as a strategy. We must evaluate whether it increases our expected payoff.

Let’s examine the **possible cases** based on Player 1’s choice.

---

#### **Case 1: Player 1 does NOT delegate**

So Player 1 plays A0 or A1.

Then:
- If **you delegate**, 1 player (you) delegates → mediator plays A1 for **you**
- So your action becomes A1
- Player 1 plays A0 or A1 → so your payoff is:
  - If P1 plays A0: you play A1 vs P1 A0 → you get **20**
  - If P1 plays A1: you play A1 vs P1 A1 → you get **4**

So your **expected payoff from delegating**, given P1 doesn't delegate, is:
- 20 ⋅ P(P1 plays A0) + 4 ⋅ P(P1 plays A1)

But if you were to **play A1 yourself**, your payoff would be:
- 20 (if P1 plays A0)
- 4 (if P1 plays A1) → same

So **if P1 doesn't delegate**, delegating gives you the same payoff as playing A1 **directly**, because:
- Mediator plays A1 when only you delegate.

So delegating **mirrors** playing A1, in this case.

But only **if** you expect Player 1 not to delegate.

Now let’s consider:

---

#### **Case 2: Player 1 ALSO delegates**

Then 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0 for **you** (and for P1)

So your action is A0.

Player 1’s action is A0 (since mediator plays A0 for them too).

So outcome: both A0 → you get **10 points**

Compare that to if you had played A0 yourself: same.

But what if you had played A1? Then you’d get 20 if P1 plays A0 — but **in this case P1 is playing A0 (because mediator plays A0)**, so you’d get 20 — better than 10.

Wait — so **if Player 1 delegates, then you get only 10 if you delegate, but could get 20 if you play A1 yourself**

So **delegating is bad in this case**

But if you delegate, and P1 delegates, then you are forced to A0 → you get 10.

But if you **room hand** and play A1, you get 20.

So in this case, **delegating is harmful**.

---

### **Step 6: Incentive Conflict**

- If **only you** delegate → mediator plays A1 for you.
- So you act like you played A1.
- If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 for both → you get 10 (instead of possibly 20 if you played A1)

So > You gain if you delegate **only when Player 1 does not delegate**, but lose if they do.

But you **cannot control** whether Player 1 delegates.

So delegation is risky.

But here's a key insight:

> The **mediator’s behavior is based on number of delegators**, so if you delegate, you **reduce your own agency**.

But maybe **delegation is a credible commitment**?

Wait — let’s consider that **Player 1** is also rational and may consider delegation.

Suppose **Player 1** is rational and realizes that:
- If **both delegate**, then both play A0 → both get 10
- If **only you delegate**, then you play A1, P1 can play A0 → P1 gets 0 (if you play A1, they play A0), which is bad for them.
- If **only Player 1 delegates**, then they play A1 (since only one delegate), so they get high payoff if you play A0.

But **you** care about your own payoff.

Let’s try to find a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**, assuming both players are rational.

But let’s instead think: **is delegation ever a dominant strategy?**

No — because it depends on the other player.

But let’s suppose **both players delegate**.

Then both play A0 → both get 10.

But if you had played A1 instead, and Player 1 still plays A0 (because they delegated), then you would get 20 — better.

So **both delegating is bad** — both get 10, but could get 20 if you played A1 instead (while they play A0).

So **both delegating is inefficient and suboptimal**.

But if Player 1 **does NOT delegate**, and you do, then you play A1, and Player 1 plays A0 or A1.

If Player 1 plays A0, you get 20 — great.

So **you prefer to delegate only if Player 1 does not**.

But if Player 1 sees that you might delegate, they might play A0 to avoid getting 0.

But let’s model this.

---

### **Step 7: Break Down Payoffs Based on Delegation Decisions**

Let’s suppose Player 1 uses a strategy: they delegate with probability q.

We (Player 2) choose a probability r to delegate, and play A0 or A1 with certain probs.

But to find equilibrium, we can suppose a candidate strategy.

Let’s suppose **both players play a mixed strategy where they delegate with some probability**, or perhaps **one delegates**, the other doesn’t.

But here’s a key insight:

> Player 1 controls the mediator, so they might have an incentive to get more than you.

But no — the mediator’s behavior is fixed: only number of delegators matters.

So both players have **incentive to avoid both delegating**, because that forces both to A0.

But if **only one delegates**, the delegatee gets A1.

So each player wants to **be the only one to delegate**, so they can get A1 and exploit the other player playing A0.

But if both try to be the only one, they both end up **delegating together**, and both get A0 — which is bad.

So this is like a **"battle of the sexes"** or **competition to be the only delegate**.

It’s similar to a **"stalemate" or "coordination game"**.

Wait — think of this:

- If **you delegate**, and Player 1 **does not**, then you get A1 → you can get 20 if P1 plays A0.
- If **you do not delegate**, and P1 **does**, then P1 plays A1 → you get 2 if you play A0, or 4 if you play A1.
- But if **both delegate**, both get A0 → you get 10.
- If **neither**, you choose freely.

So — **your payoff depends on who delegates**.

Let’s suppose that **both players know** that if both delegate, they get 10 each.

But if only one delegates, that player gets A1 → and if the other plays A0, they get 20.

The other player gets 0 in that case — bad.

So both players **do not want to be the one not delegating when the other delegates**.

But they both **want to be the only delegate** — which gives them A1 and can exploit P1 playing A0.

So it’s a **race to be the only delegate**.

But if both try, they both end up delegating — which is bad.

So **both prefer to be the only delegate**.

But if both try to delegate, they both get 10.

So there is **no dominant strategy**.

Let’s suppose both players are symmetric and rational — so they might randomize.

Suppose both players use the same mixed strategy: delegate with probability p.

Then:

- Probability both delegate: p² → both play A0 → you get 10
- Probability only you delegate: p(1−p) → you play A1, P1 plays whatever they would play if not delegating
- Probability only P1 delegates: (1−p)p → you play your own action, P1 plays A1
- Probability neither: (1−p)² → both choose A0/A1

But in the cases where **not delegating**, the players must choose their own actions.

So to solve this fully, we need to define **what actions each player takes if they do NOT delegate**.

Let’s suppose that when a player does **not delegate**, they choose A0 or A1 based on their best response.

So now we need to define a **consistent strategy profile**.

Let’s try to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

---

### **Step 8: Try to Assume Symmetric Equilibrium**

Assume **both players use the same mixed strategy**: delegate with probability p, and if not delegating, they play A0 with probability q, A1 with probability 1−q.

But that’s a lot of variables.

Alternatively, maybe **delegation is not worth it** — because of the risk.

Wait — let’s think differently.

What if **delegation is never optimal**?

Let’s compare pure strategies.

---

### **Step 9: Evaluate Pure Strategy Payoffs (Without Delegation)**

Suppose we play A0 or A1, and Player 1 does the same.

The game without delegation is a classic coordination/defection game.

Let’s find the dominant strategies.

From **Player 2's perspective**:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You play A0 → 10
  - You play A1 → 20 → better
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You play A0 → 2
  - You play A1 → 4 → better

So A1 is **strictly better** than A0 regardless of Player 1’s action.

So A1 **dominates** A0.

Therefore, **in the absence of delegation, Player 2 should always play A1**.

And since Player 1 is symmetric? Wait — is the game symmetric?

Let’s check.

Player 1’s payoffs:

- P1 A0, P2 A0: 10
- P1 A0, P2 A1: 0
- P1 A1, P2 A0: 6
- P1 A1, P2 A1: 4

So for Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 should play A0 (10 > 6)
- If P2 plays A1: P1 should play A1 (4 > 0)

So P1 plays A0 if P2 plays A0, A1 if P2 plays A1 → best response is to **match** P2.

Player 2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0: play A1 → 20 > 10
- If P1 plays A1: play A1 → 4 > 2

So Player 2 always wants to play A1.

So the unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies is:
- P1: play A1
- P2: play A1
→ both get 4

But is that the only equilibrium?

Another NE: both play A0 — then if you deviate to A1, you get 20 — better.

So A0,A0 is not NE.

Only NE is (A1, A1)

So **if both play independently**, the equilibrium is both play A1 → you get 4.

---

### **Step 10: Now Consider Delegation**

Can **delegation improve your payoff**?

Suppose you delegate.

Then:
- If **Player 1 does NOT delegate**, then **you** play A1 (mediator plays A1 when only one delegate)
- And Player 1 plays A1 (since A1 is dominant for P1)
- So you play A1, P1 plays A1 → you get **4**

But if you had played A1 yourself, same result → **no gain**

- If **Player 1 DELEGATES**, then two delegates → mediator plays A0 for you → you play A0
- Player 1 plays A0
- So both play A0 → you get **10**

But if you had played A1 yourself, and P1 is delegating → P1 plays A0 → you would have played A1 → you get **20**

So you get **10** from delegating, but could get **20** if you played A1 instead.

So **delegating is worse when Player 1 delegates**

But what if Player 1 delegates?

They would only delegate if it’s rational for them.

Now, **is delegation rational for Player 1?**

Let’s see Player 1’s perspective.

If you delegate, and P1 does NOT delegate:
- You play A1
- P1 can play A0 or A1
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 0
- If P1 plays A1 → P1 gets 4

So P1 should play A1 → you get 20, P1 gets 4.

If you **do NOT delegate**, and P1 delegates:
- P1 plays A1
- You play your own action
- If you play A1 → you get 4, P1 gets 4
- If you play A0 → you get 2, P1 gets 6

So P1 prefers you to play A1 → so you will play A1.

So if P1 delegates, you play A1 → both get 4

Now, if both delegate:
- Both play A0 → both get 10

So for P1:
- If only you delegate → P1 uses A1 → gets 4
- If only P1 delegates → P1 gets A1, you play A1 → P1 gets 4
- If both delegate → P1 gets 10
- If neither → both play A1 → P1 gets 4

So P1 gets **10** only if both delegate — otherwise 4.

So for P1, **delegation is beneficial** only if **both delegate**, because then they get 10 instead of 4.

So P1 has incentive to delegate **if they believe you will also delegate**.

Similarly, you get 10 if both delegate, but 20 if you play A1 and they play A0.

But if you delegate, and P1 delegates, you get 10.

But if you play A1 and P1 plays A0, you get 20.

But if you play A1, and P1 delegates → P1 plays A0 → so you get 20.

So **if you play A1 yourself, and P1 delegates, you get 20**

But if you delegate and P1 delegates, you get 10.

So **you prefer not to delegate when P1 delegates**, because you can get 20 instead of 10.

But if P1 does NOT delegate, and you delegate, you play A1 → same as if you played A1 yourself → you get 20 if P1 plays A0, 4 if P1 plays A1.

But P1 plays A1 anyway.

So you get 4 either way.

So **delegating gives you 10 if P1 delegates, but 4 if P1 does not** (same as playing A1 directly).

But if P1 does not delegate, your payoff is 4 in both cases.

If P1 delegates, **delegating gives you 10**, but **not delegating gives you 20

We must evaluate whether it increases our expected payoff.\n\nLet’s examine the **possible cases** based on Player 1’s choice.\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 1: Player 1 does NOT delegate**\n\nSo Player 1 plays A0 or A1.\n\nThen:\n- If **you delegate**, 1 player (you) delegates → mediator plays A1 for **you**\n- So your action becomes A1\n- Player 1 plays A0 or A1 → so your payoff is:\n  - If P1 plays A0: you play A1 vs P1 A0 → you get **20**\n  - If P1 plays A1: you play A1 vs P1 A1 → you get **4**\n\nSo your **expected payoff from delegating**, given P1 doesn\'t delegate, is:\n- 20 ⋅ P(P1 plays A0) + 4 ⋅ P(P1 plays A1)\n\nBut if you were to **play A1 yourself**, your payoff would be:\n- 20 (if P1 plays A0)\n- 4 (if P1 plays A1) → same\n\nSo **if P1 doesn\'t delegate**, delegating gives you the same payoff as playing A1 **directly**, because:\n- Mediator plays A1 when only you delegate.\n\nSo delegating **mirrors** playing A1, in this case.\n\nBut only **if** you expect Player 1 not to delegate.\n\nNow let’s consider:\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 2: Player 1 ALSO delegates**\n\nThen 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0 for **you** (and for P1)\n\nSo your action is A0.\n\nPlayer 1’s action is A0 (since mediator plays A0 for them too).\n\nSo outcome: both A0 → you get **10 points**\n\nCompare that to if you had played A0 yourself: same.\n\nBut what if you had played A1? Then you’d get 20 if P1 plays A0 — but **in this case P1 is playing A0 (because mediator plays A0)**, so you’d get 20 — better than 10.\n\nWait — so **if Player 1 delegates, then you get only 10 if you delegate, but could get 20 if you play A1 yourself**\n\nSo **delegating is bad in this case**\n\nBut if you delegate, and P1 delegates, then you are forced to A0 → you get 10.\n\nBut if you **room hand** and play A1, you get 20.\n\nSo in this case, **delegating is harmful**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Incentive Conflict**\n\n- If **only you** delegate → mediator plays A1 for you.\n- So you act like you played A1.\n- If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 for both → you get 10 (instead of possibly 20 if you played A1)\n\nSo > You gain if you delegate **only when Player 1 does not delegate**, but lose if they do.\n\nBut you **cannot control** whether Player 1 delegates.\n\nSo delegation is risky.\n\nBut here\'s a key insight:\n\n> The **mediator’s behavior is based on number of delegators**, so if you delegate, you **reduce your own agency**.\n\nBut maybe **delegation is a credible commitment**?\n\nWait — let’s consider that **Player 1** is also rational and may consider delegation.\n\nSuppose **Player 1** is rational and realizes that:\n- If **both delegate**, then both play A0 → both get 10\n- If **only you delegate**, then you play A1, P1 can play A0 → P1 gets 0 (if you play A1, they play A0), which is bad for them.\n- If **only Player 1 delegates**, then they play A1 (since only one delegate), so they get high payoff if you play A0.\n\nBut **you** care about your own payoff.\n\nLet’s try to find a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**, assuming both players are rational.\n\nBut let’s instead think: **is delegation ever a dominant strategy?**\n\nNo — because it depends on the other player.\n\nBut let’s suppose **both players delegate**.\n\nThen both play A0 → both get 10.\n\nBut if you had played A1 instead, and Player 1 still plays A0 (because they delegated), then you would get 20 — better.\n\nSo **both delegating is bad** — both get 10, but could get 20 if you played A1 instead (while they play A0).\n\nSo **both delegating is inefficient and suboptimal**.\n\nBut if Player 1 **does NOT delegate**, and you do, then you play A1, and Player 1 plays A0 or A1.\n\nIf Player 1 plays A0, you get 20 — great.\n\nSo **you prefer to delegate only if Player 1 does not**.\n\nBut if Player 1 sees that you might delegate, they might play A0 to avoid getting 0.\n\nBut let’s model this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Break Down Payoffs Based on Delegation Decisions**\n\nLet’s suppose Player 1 uses a strategy: they delegate with probability q.\n\nWe (Player 2) choose a probability r to delegate, and play A0 or A1 with certain probs.\n\nBut to find equilibrium, we can suppose a candidate strategy.\n\nLet’s suppose **both players play a mixed strategy where they delegate with some probability**, or perhaps **one delegates**, the other doesn’t.\n\nBut here’s a key insight:\n\n> Player 1 controls the mediator, so they might have an incentive to get more than you.\n\nBut no — the mediator’s behavior is fixed: only number of delegators matters.\n\nSo both players have **incentive to avoid both delegating**, because that forces both to A0.\n\nBut if **only one delegates**, the delegatee gets A1.\n\nSo each player wants to **be the only one to delegate**, so they can get A1 and exploit the other player playing A0.\n\nBut if both try to be the only one, they both end up **delegating together**, and both get A0 — which is bad.\n\nSo this is like a **"battle of the sexes"** or **competition to be the only delegate**.\n\nIt’s similar to a **"stalemate" or "coordination game"**.\n\nWait — think of this:\n\n- If **you delegate**, and Player 1 **does not**, then you get A1 → you can get 20 if P1 plays A0.\n- If **you do not delegate**, and P1 **does**, then P1 plays A1 → you get 2 if you play A0, or 4 if you play A1.\n- But if **both delegate**, both get A0 → you get 10.\n- If **neither**, you choose freely.\n\nSo — **your payoff depends on who delegates**.\n\nLet’s suppose that **both players know** that if both delegate, they get 10 each.\n\nBut if only one delegates, that player gets A1 → and if the other plays A0, they get 20.\n\nThe other player gets 0 in that case — bad.\n\nSo both players **do not want to be the one not delegating when the other delegates**.\n\nBut they both **want to be the only delegate** — which gives them A1 and can exploit P1 playing A0.\n\nSo it’s a **race to be the only delegate**.\n\nBut if both try, they both end up delegating — which is bad.\n\nSo **both prefer to be the only delegate**.\n\nBut if both try to delegate, they both get 10.\n\nSo there is **no dominant strategy**.\n\nLet’s suppose both players are symmetric and rational — so they might randomize.\n\nSuppose both players use the same mixed strategy: delegate with probability p.\n\nThen:\n\n- Probability both delegate: p² → both play A0 → you get 10\n- Probability only you delegate: p(1−p) → you play A1, P1 plays whatever they would play if not delegating\n- Probability only P1 delegates: (1−p)p → you play your own action, P1 plays A1\n- Probability neither: (1−p)² → both choose A0/A1\n\nBut in the cases where **not delegating**, the players must choose their own actions.\n\nSo to solve this fully, we need to define **what actions each player takes if they do NOT delegate**.\n\nLet’s suppose that when a player does **not delegate**, they choose A0 or A1 based on their best response.\n\nSo now we need to define a **consistent strategy profile**.\n\nLet’s try to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Try to Assume Symmetric Equilibrium**\n\nAssume **both players use the same mixed strategy**: delegate with probability p, and if not delegating, they play A0 with probability q, A1 with probability 1−q.\n\nBut that’s a lot of variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe **delegation is not worth it** — because of the risk.\n\nWait — let’s think differently.\n\nWhat if **delegation is never optimal**?\n\nLet’s compare pure strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Evaluate Pure Strategy Payoffs (Without Delegation)**\n\nSuppose we play A0 or A1, and Player 1 does the same.\n\nThe game without delegation is a classic coordination/defection game.\n\nLet’s find the dominant strategies.\n\nFrom **Player 2\'s perspective**:\n\n- If Player 1 plays A0:\n  - You play A0 → 10\n  - You play A1 → 20 → better\n- If Player 1 plays A1:\n  - You play A0 → 2\n  - You play A1 → 4 → better\n\nSo A1 is **strictly better** than A0 regardless of Player 1’s action.\n\nSo A1 **dominates** A0.\n\nTherefore, **in the absence of delegation, Player 2 should always play A1**.\n\nAnd since Player 1 is symmetric? Wait — is the game symmetric?\n\nLet’s check.\n\nPlayer 1’s payoffs:\n\n- P1 A0, P2 A0: 10\n- P1 A0, P2 A1: 0\n- P1 A1, P2 A0: 6\n- P1 A1, P2 A1: 4\n\nSo for Player 1:\n- If P2 plays A0: P1 should play A0 (10 > 6)\n- If P2 plays A1: P1 should play A1 (4 > 0)\n\nSo P1 plays A0 if P2 plays A0, A1 if P2 plays A1 → best response is to **match** P2.\n\nPlayer 2’s best response:\n- If P1 plays A0: play A1 → 20 > 10\n- If P1 plays A1: play A1 → 4 > 2\n\nSo Player 2 always wants to play A1.\n\nSo the unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies is:\n- P1: play A1\n- P2: play A1\n→ both get 4\n\nBut is that the only equilibrium?\n\nAnother NE: both play A0 — then if you deviate to A1, you get 20 — better.\n\nSo A0,A0 is not NE.\n\nOnly NE is (A1, A1)\n\nSo **if both play independently**, the equilibrium is both play A1 → you get 4.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Now Consider Delegation**\n\nCan **delegation improve your payoff**?\n\nSuppose you delegate.\n\nThen:\n- If **Player 1 does NOT delegate**, then **you** play A1 (mediator plays A1 when only one delegate)\n- And Player 1 plays A1 (since A1 is dominant for P1)\n- So you play A1, P1 plays A1 → you get **4**\n\nBut if you had played A1 yourself, same result → **no gain**\n\n- If **Player 1 DELEGATES**, then two delegates → mediator plays A0 for you → you play A0\n- Player 1 plays A0\n- So both play A0 → you get **10**\n\nBut if you had played A1 yourself, and P1 is delegating → P1 plays A0 → you would have played A1 → you get **20**\n\nSo you get **10** from delegating, but could get **20** if you played A1 instead.\n\nSo **delegating is worse when Player 1 delegates**\n\nBut what if Player 1 delegates?\n\nThey would only delegate if it’s rational for them.\n\nNow, **is delegation rational for Player 1?**\n\nLet’s see Player 1’s perspective.\n\nIf you delegate, and P1 does NOT delegate:\n- You play A1\n- P1 can play A0 or A1\n- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 0\n- If P1 plays A1 → P1 gets 4\n\nSo P1 should play A1 → you get 20, P1 gets 4.\n\nIf you **do NOT delegate**, and P1 delegates:\n- P1 plays A1\n- You play your own action\n- If you play A1 → you get 4, P1 gets 4\n- If you play A0 → you get 2, P1 gets 6\n\nSo P1 prefers you to play A1 → so you will play A1.\n\nSo if P1 delegates, you play A1 → both get 4\n\nNow, if both delegate:\n- Both play A0 → both get 10\n\nSo for P1:\n- If only you delegate → P1 uses A1 → gets 4\n- If only P1 delegates → P1 gets A1, you play A1 → P1 gets 4\n- If both delegate → P1 gets 10\n- If neither → both play A1 → P1 gets 4\n\nSo P1 gets **10** only if both delegate — otherwise 4.\n\nSo for P1, **delegation is beneficial** only if **both delegate**, because then they get 10 instead of 4.\n\nSo P1 has incentive to delegate **if they believe you will also delegate**.\n\nSimilarly, you get 10 if both delegate, but 20 if you play A1 and they play A0.\n\nBut if you delegate, and P1 delegates, you get 10.\n\nBut if you play A1 and P1 plays A0, you get 20.\n\nBut if you play A1, and P1 delegates → P1 plays A0 → so you get 20.\n\nSo **if you play A1 yourself, and P1 delegates, you get 20**\n\nBut if you delegate and P1 delegates, you get 10.\n\nSo **you prefer not to delegate when P1 delegates**, because you can get 20 instead of 10.\n\nBut if P1 does NOT delegate, and you delegate, you play A1 → same as if you played A1 yourself → you get 20 if P1 plays A0, 4 if P1 plays A1.\n\nBut P1 plays A1 anyway.\n\nSo you get 4 either way.\n\nSo **delegating gives you 10 if P1 delegates, but 4 if P1 does not** (same as playing A1 directly).\n\nBut if P1 does not delegate, your payoff is 4 in both cases.\n\nIf P1 delegates, **delegating gives you 10**, but **not delegating gives you 20'

response:
Let’s carefully analyze the game step by step to determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, who is trying to maximize their expected points, including the option to delegate to the mediator.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without Delegation**

The base game has the following payoffs (from **Player 2's** perspective):

|         | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| P2: A0  | 10     | 2      |
| P2: A1  | 20     | 4      |

- Player 2 has a **strict dominant strategy: A1**.
  - If P1 plays A0: A1 (20) > A0 (10)
  - If P1 plays A1: A1 (4) > A0 (2)
- Player 1’s best response:
  - If P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0 (10 > 6)
  - If P2 plays A1 → P1 prefers A1 (4 > 0)
- So **P1’s best response is to match P2’s action**.

Thus, the **only pure-strategy Nash equilibrium** is:
- P2: A1
- P1: A1
→ Both get 4 points.

No other pure strategy is stable because if both played A0, P2 would want to deviate to A1 for 20.

So **independent play leads to (A1, A1), payoff 4 for Player 2**.

---

### **Step 2: Introduce Delegation (A2)**

New action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

Mediator’s rule:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

Note:
- Delegation **locks in your action based on the number of delegators**, not your choice.

Now, consider how delegation affects your **expected payoff**, assuming **Player 1 is rational and will also optimize their strategy**.

We want to find a **Nash equilibrium** where both players choose strategies (possibly mixed) that are best responses.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Strategic Incentives of Delegation**

Let’s evaluate what happens in different delegation scenarios:

#### **Case 1: You delegate (A2), Player 1 does NOT delegate**
- Only 1 delegate → mediator plays **A1 for you**
- P1 plays their own action (best response)
- P1 will play A1 (dominant for them), so:
  - You play A1, P1 plays A1 → you get **4**
- If you played A1 yourself instead, same result → **no gain from delegating**

#### **Case 2: You do NOT delegate, Player 1 delegates**
- Only 1 delegate (P1) → mediator plays **A1 for P1**
- You play your own action (best response)
- Since P1 plays A1, you will play A1 (best response) → you get **4**
- Again, same as independent play.

#### **Case 3: Both delegate (A2)**
- 2 delegates → mediator plays **A0 for both**
- So you play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get **10**

But: **If you had played A1 yourself, instead of delegating, and P1 is delegating (so P1 plays A0), you would get 20**!

- So by delegating, you **get only 10**, but could get **20** if you played A1 instead.

→ **Delegating when both delegate is extremely bad for you**

#### **Case 4: Neither delegates**
- Both choose independently
- As before, equilibrium is both play A1 → you get **4**

---

### **Step 4: Compare Delegation vs. Independent Play**

- If you **never delegate**, best response leads to A1, payoff 4.
- If you **delegate**, outcomes:
  - If P1 does **not** delegate: you get 4 (same as A1)
  - If P1 **does** delegate: you get **10** (but could get 20 by not delegating)

→ **You get 10 when both delegate, but could get 20 if you played A1**

So **delegating reduces your payoff when P1 delegates**, and only matches it when P1 doesn’t.

But **you cannot control** P1’s choice.

Now, consider **P1’s incentives**:

- P1 gets 4 if only you delegate, only P1 delegates, or neither delegate.
- P1 gets **10** **only** when both delegate.
- So P1 has a strong incentive to **delegate if they believe you will too**, to get 10 instead of 4.

But if both try to delegate under the expectation of coordination, they end up both delegating — which gives them 10, but **only if both are minimizing payoff difference**.

However, **P1 has no incentive to delegate if they believe you will not**, because then P1 gets 4 either way (if P1 delegates alone: gets 4; if not, gets 4).

But **P1 might delegate if they suspect you will**.

Let’s suppose **both players are symmetric**, and rational.

Could there be a symmetric equilibrium?

Suppose both use a mixed strategy:
- With probability *p*, delegate
- With probability *(1−p)*, play A1 (since A1 is dominant when not delegating)

Then:

- **Both delegate** (prob. *p²*): you get **10**
- **You delegate, P1 does not** (prob. *p(1−p)*): you get **4**
- **You do not, P1 delegates** (prob. *(1−p)p*): you get **4**
- **Neither** (prob. *(1−p)²*): both play A1 → you get **4**

So your **expected payoff** is:
> E = 10·p² + 4·p(1−p) + 4·(1−p)p + 4·(1−p)²  
> = 10p² + 4p(1−p) + 4p(1−p) + 4(1−2p+p²)  
> = 10p² + 8p(1−p) + 4(1−2p+p²)  
> = 10p² + 8p − 8p² + 4 − 8p + 4p²  
> = (10p² − 8p² + 4p²) + (8p − 8p) + 4  
> = 6p² + 4

So **E = 6p² + 4**

To **maximize expected payoff**, we want to maximize p².

→ Max when **p = 1** (always delegate)

But if both always delegate, payoff = 6(1)² + 4 = 10

But is this an equilibrium?

Check: if both always delegate → you get 10

But if you **deviate** and **do not delegate**, while P1 still delegates (so only P1 delegates → P1 plays A1), then you can play A1 → you get:

- P1 plays A1, you play A1 → you get **4**

Wait — that’s **worse** than 10!

But wait: if only P1 delegates, mediator plays A1 for P1 → P1 plays A1.

Then you can play A0 or A1.

If you play A1 → you get 4 (from P1 A1, P2 A1)

But if you play A0 → you get 2

So best to play A1 → you get 4

But if you had **delegated**, you would get **A0** (since two delegates), so **10**

→ So if P1 delegates, **you are better off delegating** (get 10) than not (get 4)

So **no incentive to deviate**.

Similarly, if you were to not delegate when both otherwise do, you get only 4 < 10 → so no incentive.

But wait — what if **P1 is not delegating**?

Actually, under this symmetric strategy (both always delegate), the other player **will** delegate, so you get 10.

But is this **stable against unilateral deviation**?

Yes: if you deviate to not delegating, while P1 still delegates → only one delegate → you play A1 → you get 4 < 10 → **you lose**

So **p=1 (always delegate) is a Nash equilibrium**

And payoff is 10.

But earlier we said: if P1 delegates, you would get 20 by playing A1 → but that’s only possible if **P1 is playing A0**, which happens **only if P1 delegates and you don't** — but in that case, you get only 20 **if** you play A1, and P1 plays A0.

Wait — no: if **P1 delegates**, mediator plays A1 for P1 → P1 plays A1, not A0.

So **P1 always plays A1 when they delegate**.

Therefore, if **only P1 delegates**, P1 plays A1.

So if you play A1, you get 4.

If you play A0, you get 2.

So you play A1 → get 4.

But if you **delegated**, you would play A0 → get 10.

So in fact, **if P1 delegates, you get more by delegating (10) than by playing A1 (4)**.

So **in all cases where P1 delegates (whether alone or together), you are better off delegating**.

Thus, **if you believe P1 delegates**, you should delegate.

But P1 delegates only if they believe you will.

So a symmetric **"both delegate"** equilibrium gives you 10.

But is there a **better equilibrium**?

Suppose **neither delegates**.

Then both play A1 → you get 4 < 10 → worse.

Suppose **you never delegate**, but P1 appears to?

But if P1 delegates, you get only 4 if you play A1.

But if you delegate, you get 10.

So you will deviate.

Thus, **only stable equilibrium is both delegate**, where both get 10.

But what if P1 tries not to delegate?

Then you might play A1 → you get 4 (since P1 plays A1), but P1 gets 4.

But P1 can get **10** only if both delegate.

So P1 will want to delegate if they think you will.

Thus, **both delegating is a stable equilibrium**.

And your payoff is **10** — better than independent play (4).

Can you do better?

Suppose you delegate **only if you believe P1 won’t**, but you can’t control P1.

But in equilibrium, the only stable outcome is both delegate → you get 10.

Is there a mixed strategy that gives **more than 10**?

From earlier: E = 6p² + 4

Max at p=1 → E=10.

So **maximum expected payoff is 10**, achieved by **always delegating**.

But is there a better equilibrium?

Suppose you delegate with probability p, and P1 does the same.

But if both are rational and symmetric, the only symmetric Nash equilibrium is **both always delegate**.

Furthermore, **no deviation is profitable**.

Therefore, **delegating with probability 100% is optimal**.

---

### **Step 5: Final Strategy**

Since delegating leads to a stable equilibrium with **10 points** (better than 4 from independent play), and **no incentive to deviate**, the optimal strategy is:

- **Always delegate** → probability 100% on A2
- A0 and A1: 0%

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

### **1. Understand the Game and Payoffs**

We are in a two-player game where each player chooses an action (A0, A1, or A2 = "Delegate to Mediator").

The payoffs are as follows (Player 1 vs Player 2):

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 10          | 10                     |
| A1          | A0                     | 20          | 0                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 2           | 6                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 4           | 4                      |

Note: You are playing as **Player 2**.

So when you choose your action and the other player chooses theirs, the payoff is determined accordingly.

---

### **2. The Delegation Option (A2)**

You can choose to **delegate** your move to a mediator via action A2.

- If **you delegate**, the mediator will play for you based on **how many players have delegated to it**.

The mediator rules:
- If **1 player delegates** → it plays **A1**
- If **2 players delegate** → it plays **A0**

Important: Since there are only two players, the number of delegators can be 0, 1, or 2.

So, if you delegate (A2), your effective move depends on whether the other player also delegates:

- If **only you delegate** (other does not) → mediator plays A1
- If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0
- If **neither delegates** → no effect

But now comes a key point: **you must decide your own probability distribution over A0, A1, and A2**, anticipating both your own choice and how the other player might react.

This is a simultaneous move game with uncertainty about the opponent’s behavior.

Also note: The delegation decision is **simultaneous**; neither knows the other’s choice before committing.

---

### **3. The Mediator’s Effectiveness Depends on Aggregate Delegation**

Let’s analyze what happens depending on who delegates.

#### Case 1: You don’t delegate (choose A0 or A1), other does not delegate → both play independently.
→ You act normally; no mediation.

#### Case 2: You delegate (A2), other **does not**.
→ Only one person delegates → mediator plays A1 for **you**.
→ So *your action becomes A1*.
→ Other player plays whatever they choose (A0 or A1).

#### Case 3: You delegate (A2), other **also delegates**.
→ Two people delegate → mediator plays A0 for **you**.
→ So *your action becomes A0*.
→ The other player’s action is also mediated → their action is A0.

So now we can model outcomes based on combinations.

---

### **4. Strategy Space**

Your strategy: A mixed strategy over A0, A1, A2 — probabilities p(A0), p(A1), p(A2), such that:
p(A0) + p(A1) + p(A2) = 100

Let’s denote:
- Your choice: random variable X ∈ {A0, A1, A2}
- Opponent’s choice: Y ∈ {A0, A1, A2}

Since actions are chosen simultaneously, we must consider expectations across all combinations.

Let’s suppose the opponent uses some fixed strategy too — but since this is a symmetric setup and we’re trying to maximize our own expected points, we need to find a **best response**, or perhaps consider a Nash equilibrium-like situation.

However, note the twist: **you are Player 2, and you are choosing your action. The mediator was proposed by Player 2** — this may suggest that you have some control or influence, but crucially, it doesn't give you any inherent advantage unless you believe others will behave predictably.

Since this is a decision-making game and you want to maximize your expected payoff, and assuming the other player is also rational (but possibly with unknown strategy), we should consider **if there exists a dominant strategy or a best mixed strategy**.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look for **symmetric equilibria** or compute expected payoffs under possible strategies.

But here’s a better idea:

Because you’re the only one deciding, and you want to maximize your expected payoff, you can reason through the implications of your choice **regardless of the opponent's strategy**, by considering all possible scenarios.

But since the opponent’s behavior is unknown, you must assume they are also rational — so we’re looking for a **self-consistent mixed strategy** where neither player wants to deviate.

Let’s try to solve this using the lens of **game theory**, specifically looking for a symmetric mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (since both players are symmetric in structure except for the mediator being "proposed by Player 2", which likely just implies it's available).

Wait — is the game symmetric?

Yes, the payoffs are symmetric in form, although the mediator was proposed by Player 2. But since both players have access to the same mediating option (via A2), the game is symmetric.

Therefore, we can look for a **symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** where both players use the same mixed strategy.

Assume both players use the same mixed strategy:
- p = prob(A0)
- q = prob(A1)
- r = prob(A2) = 1 - p - q

Our goal: Find values p, q, r ≥ 0, summing to 100, such that **no player wants to deviate** — i.e., your expected utility from following the strategy is at least as high as from switching to any other pure action.

We'll compute the expected payoff from each action (A0, A1, A2), conditional on the opponent using the mixed strategy (p, q, r).

Then set up the condition that **all used actions in equilibrium give the same expected payoff**, and unused ones give less.

---

### **5. Compute Expected Payoff for Each of Your Actions (as Player 2)**

Let’s denote:
- Let the other player’s strategy be: P(A0) = p, P(A1) = q, P(A2) = r = 1 - p - q

Now calculate the **expected payoff for you**, given you take each action.

---

#### **Case 1: You choose A0**

Then your action is A0 (independent).

Your payoff depends on the opponent’s action:

- If opponent chooses A0: payoff = 10
- If opponent chooses A1: payoff = 2
- If opponent chooses A2: then opponent has delegated → so their action is governed by the mediator.

When the opponent chooses A2, the number of delegates is:
- If *you did not* delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 for them → so they play A1
  (In this case, you chose A0, opponent chose A2 → total delegates = 1 → opponent plays A1)

Thus, opponent’s effective action is A1.

So:
- If opponent chooses A2, your action is A0, opponent acts as A1 → payoff = 2

So overall:

Expected payoff from choosing A0:
= P(opponent chooses A0) × 10  
+ P(opponent chooses A1) × 2  
+ P(opponent chooses A2) × 2  
= p×10 + q×2 + r×2

So:  
E[A0] = 10p + 2q + 2r

---

#### **Case 2: You choose A1**

Your action is A1 (independent).

Payoffs:
- Opponent A0 → you get 20
- Opponent A1 → you get 4
- Opponent A2 → opponent delegates → total delegates = 1 (since you didn’t delegate) → mediator plays A1 for them → so opponent plays A1

Thus, if opponent chooses A2, opponent effectively plays A1 → you get 4

So:
E[A1] = p×20 + q×4 + r×4

---

#### **Case 3: You choose A2 (Delegate)**

Your action is A2.

Then, your actual action depends on how many players delegate.

- If opponent chooses A0 or A1 → only you delegate → total delegates = 1 → mediator plays A1 for you → your action is A1
- If opponent chooses A2 → both delegate → total = 2 → mediator plays A0 for you → your action is A0

So we need to compute your payoff in expectation under this scenario.

Let’s break it down:

- With probability p: opponent plays A0 → you are the only delegate → your action is A1 → your payoff depends on opponent’s A0
  → When you play A1, opponent plays A0 → payoff = 20

- With probability q: opponent plays A1 → you are the only delegate → your action is A1 → opponent plays A1 → payoff = 4

- With probability r: opponent delegates → both delegate → your action is A0 → opponent’s action is A0 → payoff = 10

Thus:
E[A2] = p×20 + q×4 + r×10

---

### **6. Summary of Expected Payoffs**

Let:
- p = prob(opponent A0)
- q = prob(opponent A1)
- r = prob(opponent A2) = 1 - p - q

Then:
- E[A0] = 10p + 2q + 2r
- E[A1] = 20p + 4q + 4r
- E[A2] = 20p + 4q + 10r

---

### **7. Equilibrium Condition**

In a symmetric mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, the **expected payoffs from all actions that are used with positive probability must be equal**, and higher than those not used.

We hypothesize that all three actions are used in equilibrium (A0, A1, A2). We’ll test that assumption.

Set:
E[A0] = E[A1] = E[A2]

Let’s first try to solve:

#### Step 1: Set E[A0] = E[A1]

10p + 2q + 2r = 20p + 4q + 4r  
Bring all terms to left:
10p + 2q + 2r - 20p - 4q - 4r = 0  
→ -10p -2q -2r = 0  
Multiply both sides by -1:
10p + 2q + 2r = 0

But p, q, r ≥ 0 → sum cannot be 0 unless p=q=r=0 → contradiction.

This is impossible. So **E[A0] ≠ E[A1]**?

Wait — this suggests that E[A0] < E[A1] always?

Let’s see: E[A1] – E[A0] = (20p + 4q + 4r) – (10p + 2q + 2r) = 10p + 2q + 2r

Which is clearly ≥ 0, and > 0 if any of p,q,r > 0.

So **E[A1] > E[A0]** for any non-degenerate strategy of the opponent.

Thus, **you will never want to play A0** if you’re considering mixing, because A1 always gives higher expected payoff than A0 **given any opponent strategy**.

Therefore, in any equilibrium, **you should never play A0** — unless the opponent is extremely likely to play A1 or A2, but even then, let's confirm.

Suppose opponent plays only A2 (r=1): then:
- E[A0] = 10(0)+2(0)+2(1)=2
- E[A1] = 20(0)+4(0)+4(1)=4
- E[A2] = 20(0)+4(0)+10(1)=10

Still, A1 > A0.

If opponent plays only A1:
- E[A0]=2
- E[A1]=4
- E[A2]=4

Again A0 < A1.

Even if opponent plays mostly A0:
Say p=1, q=r=0:
- E[A0] = 10
- E[A1] = 20
- E[A2] = 20

Still, A1 > A0.

So yes — **for any strategy the opponent might play, A1 gives strictly higher expected payoff than A0**.

Therefore, **A0 is strictly dominated by A1**.

So **you should never play A0**.

So p = 0 in equilibrium.

Thus, we revise: your strategy must assign 0 probability to A0.

Now reconsider: is A1 ever dominated? Or is A2 better?

So now, we only need to consider mixing between A1 and A2.

Let:
- Let x = probability you play A1
- y = probability you play A2
- Then probability of A0 = 0 → so x + y = 1 → y = 1 - x

Now, compute expected payoffs for you, again assuming opponent uses same mixed strategy: A0 (0), A1 (x), A2 (y=1−x)

So:
- P(opponent A1) = x
- P(opponent A2) = 1−x

Now compute E[A1], E[A2] from your perspective.

We already have formulas, but now set p = 0.

So:

#### From earlier:

E[A0] = 10p + 2q + 2r = 0 + 2x + 2(1−x) = 2x + 2 - 2x = 2

E[A1] = 20p + 4q + 4r = 0 + 4x + 4(1−x) = 4x + 4 - 4x = 4

E[A2] = 20p + 4q + 10r = 0 + 4x + 10(1−x) = 4x + 10 - 10x = 10 - 6x

Now, in symmetric equilibrium, if you are mixing between A1 and A2, then E[A1] must equal E[A2].

Set:
E[A1] = E[A2]
→ 4 = 10 - 6x
→ 6x = 6
→ x = 1

Then y = 0

So only solution is x=1 → you play A1 with probability 1.

But then y = 0 → so you never play A2.

Contradiction: if we’re assuming you mix between A1 and A2, but the only solution is y=0 → no mixing.

But wait — if you play A1 with probability 1, then opponent’s strategy matters.

Check consistency.

If you play A1 with certainty, then opponent’s best response?

Opponent computes their own payoffs:

But remember: you are Player 2, and you are choosing your strategy.

For symmetry, we assume both players are identical.

But now, suppose the equilibrium is: both players play A1 with probability 1.

Then:

- Both play A1 → payoff = 4 for each → so you get 4.

Is this stable?

Check if any player wants to deviate.

What if you switch to A2?

- If you play A2, and opponent plays A1 → only you delegate → total delegates = 1 → mediator plays A1 for you → so your effective action is A1

→ Opponent plays A1 → you get 4

Same as before → so no gain.

But wait — what if you play A2, opponent plays A1:

- Your action: A1 (because only you del) → opponent plays A1 → payoff = 4

Same as when you played A1.

So deviation to A2 gives same payoff.

Similarly, if you play A0: opponent plays A1 → payoff = 2 < 4 → worse.

So you are indifferent between A1 and A2, but prefer them over A0.

Thus, in equilibrium where everyone plays A1, you could deviate to A2 and get same payoff.

But we assumed the outcome is symmetric.

But is there a better equilibrium?

Wait — earlier we found that E[A2] = 10 - 6x, where x is your prob of A1 in opponent’s strategy.

Now suppose opponent mixes between A1 and A2.

We want to find a mixed strategy (x, 1−x) such that E[A1] = E[A2] → you are indifferent.

We had:
E[A1] = 4
E[A2] = 10 - 6x

Set equal: 4 = 10 - 6x → x = 1

Only solution is x=1 → meaning only when opponent plays A1 with probability 1, then E[A1] = E[A2] = 4

But if x < 1, say x=0 → opponent plays A2 with probability 1

Then:
- E[A1] = 4 (from earlier formula: 4x + 4(1-x) = 4)
- E[A2] = 10 - 6(0) = 10

So E[A2] = 10 > 4 → so you prefer A2.

So if opponent plays A2, you want to play A2.

But if you play A2, and opponent also plays A2, then both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → so both play A0 → payoff = 10 for each.

But if you were to deviate to A1 while opponent plays A2 → opponent plays A2 → you delegate → your action is A0 → opponent plays A0 → payoff = 10 → so same as playing A2.

Wait — actually, if you play A1 while opponent plays A2:

- You do not delegate → your action is A1
- Opponent delegates → so their action is A0 (since 2 delegates)
→ So you play A1, opponent plays A0 → payoffs: you get 20, opponent gets 0

Ah! That’s huge!

So if you play A1 and opponent plays A2:
→ you get **20** points.

That’s much better.

But earlier analysis assumed opponent plays A2 with certain probability.

Let’s recast with full clarity.

---

### **8. Critical Insight — Deviation Incentives**

Let’s fix: **assume the opponent plays A2 (delegate)** with some probability.

Then:
- If you play A1: you are not delegating → your action is A1
- Opponent is delegating → total delegates: 1 → so opponent’s action is A1
→ So you play A1, opponent plays A1 → payoff = 4

Wait — no! Important mistake.

If **you do not delegate**, and **opponent delegates** → total delegates = 1 → mediator plays A1 for the delegator → so **opponent plays A1**

Thus:
- You play A1 (independent)
- Opponent plays A1 (mediated)
→ Result: you get 4

But earlier I thought you’d get 20 — no. That only happens if opponent plays A0.

But if opponent is delegating and you aren’t, then opponent automatically plays A1.

So you **cannot** exploit the opponent’s delegation unless you can make them play A0.

But the only way to make them play A0 is if **both** delegate → then the mediator plays A0.

So if you delegate and opponent delegates → both play A0 → you get 10.

But if you play A1 and opponent delegates → opponent plays A1 → you get 4.

Only when opponent plays A0 (not delegating) and you play A1 → you get 20.

So the key is: **delegating forces the other player to play A1 if you don’t, A0 if you do.**

Back to analysis.

Given that, let’s recompute your expected payoffs under the assumption that the **opponent uses a mixed strategy**.

But now let’s **suppose** that both players are going to use a mixed strategy, and try to find one where they are indifferent between A1 and A2.

Recall:
- E[A0] = 10p + 2q + 2r = 2 + 8p (since 2q+2r = 2(1−p), and 10p + 2(1−p) = 8p + 2)
   - Wait, better: p + q + r = 1 → q + r = 1 − p
   → E[A0] = 10p + 2(q + r) = 10p + 2(1−p) = 8p + 2

- E[A1] = 20p + 4(q + r) = 20p + 4(1−p) = 16p + 4

- E[A2] = 20p + 4q + 10r

Note that q and r vary.

But if we assume symmetry, then p = q = r is unlikely.

But we already know E[A1] > E[A0] always (since 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 for all p), so A0 is dominated. So p = 0.

So assume you play only A1 and A2: let q = x, r = 1−x (probabilities of A1 and A2), p=0.

Then:
- E[A1] = 20(0) + 4(x) + 4(1−x) = 4
- E[A2] = 20(0) + 4(x) + 10(1−x) = 4x + 10 - 10x = 10 - 6x

Set E[A1] = E[A2] → 4 = 10 - 6x → x = 1

So only when x=1 (opponent plays A1 for sure), then you are indifferent between A1 and A2.

But if x < 1, E[A2] > 4 ⇒ you prefer A2

If you prefer A2 when x < 1, and you are supposed to mix, but only equality at x=1, then the only symmetric equilibrium is when everyone plays A1 with probability 1.

But in that case, E[A2] = 4 → same as E[A1], so you are indifferent.

But is it better to play A2?

If you play A2 and opponent plays A1:
- You delegate, opponent does not → total delegates = 1 → mediator plays A1 for you → you play A1
- Opponent plays A1
→ you get 4, same as if you played A1.

So no gain.

If you play A2 and opponent also plays A2:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → you play A0 → opponent plays A0 → you get 10

But if the opponent is playing A1 for sure, then this possibility has zero probability.

So only when both players are playing A2 does the mutual delegation happen.

But if you think the opponent might play A2, then playing A2 might be good.

But in symmetric equilibrium where everyone plays A1 with probability 1, you are not incentivized to deviate to A2.

However, suppose the opponent is known to play A2 with some probability.

Then playing A2 can lead to both playing A0 → payoff 10, which is better than 4.

But if both play A2 → you get 10
If only you play A2, opponent plays A1 → you get 4

So your payoff from A2 depends on opponent's action.

Let’s now abandon the symmetric equilibrium idea and instead ask: **what is the best mixed strategy for you, assuming the opponent is also optimizing?**

But since we are to maximize our points, and we control our own strategy, we need to assume the opponent will also play optimally.

But in games like this, often the optimal is to **always trust the mediator** when others are likely to delegate.

Let’s try a different approach: What if both players always delegate?

Strategy: A2 with 100%

Then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both
- So both play A0
- Payoff = 10 for each

Can either player deviate?

If you play A1 instead (while opponent plays A2):
- You play A1, opponent delegates → opponent plays A1 (since only one delegate)
- So you play A1, opponent plays A1 → payoff = 4 < 10 → worse

If you play A0: same as A0 → payoff = 10? No:

If you play A0 (independent), opponent plays A2 → opponent delegates → so opponent plays A1
→ You play A0, opponent plays A1 → payoff = 2 < 10

So deviating to A0 or A1 gives lower payoff.

So A2 is a best response to A2.

So (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium → both get 10.

Another equilibrium: both play A1 → both get 4

But since 10 > 4, (A2,A2) is better for both.

Is there a better equilibrium?

What if both play A1 with probability 1? → get 4

Or both play a mixture?

Try: suppose both players play A2 with probability r, A1 with probability 1−r

But earlier, we saw that if you play A1, your expected payoff is 4 (when opponent mixes with A1 and A2)

If you play A2, your expected payoff is 10 - 6r' where r' is opponent's r.

For you to be willing to mix, need E[A2] = E[A1] = 4

But 10 – 6r = 4 → r = 1

So again, only at r=1.

Thus, the only symmetric equilibrium in which mixing occurs is when r=1.

Otherwise, if r<1, E[A2] > 4 → you prefer A2

So the only symmetric equilibrium where players are willing to mix is when everyone plays A2 with probability 1.

And at that point, it's stable.

Moreover, in that case, you get 10.

Is there a better strategy for you alone?

Could you **deviate to A2**, hoping the other player also delegates?

But we can't control the other player.

However, notice something critical:

- If you play A2, and the other player is also rational, they may also play A2.

- And if both play A2, you both get 10.

- If you play A2, and opponent plays A1, you get 4.

- If you play A2, and opponent plays A0, you get 10 (if both delegate? No: only you delegate → so you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 20)

Wait! Let's double-check:

If you play A2 (delegate), opponent plays A0 (not delegate):

- Total delegates = 1 → so mediator plays A1 for you → you play A1
- Opponent plays A0
→ You get 20 points

Oh! This is **very good**.

So if you delegate and the opponent plays A0, you get 20.

Similarly, if opponent plays A1, you get 4.

If opponent plays A2, you get 10.

So your expected payoff from A2:
= P(opponent A0) × 20 + P(opponent A1) × 4 + P(opponent A2) × 10

This is excellent if opponent might play A0.

But if opponent plays A0, why would they? They can get 10 by playing A0, or 20 by playing A1 if you play A0.

But if you are playing A2, then:

- If opponent plays A0: you play A1 (because only you delegate), they play A0 → they get 0
- If opponent plays A1: you play A1, they play A1 → they get 4
- If opponent plays A2: they play A0, you play A0 → they get 10

So for them, the best response to you playing A2 is to play A2 (get 10), or A1 (get 4), or A0 (get 0)

So they should play A2 to get 10.

So if you play A2, they are best off playing A2.

But if you play A2, and they play A2, you both get 10.

If you play A1, and they play A2, you get 4.

So if you play A2, you get 10 in equilibrium.

Can you do better?

What if you play A1?

If you play A1, and opponent plays A2, then opponent plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 4.

Worse than 10.

What if you play A0?

If you play A0, and opponent plays A2, then opponent plays A1 → you play A0, they play A1 → you get 2.

Worse.

So if both players are rational, and you play A2, they will play A2, you get 10.

If you play anything else, you get less.

And in the (A2, A2) equilibrium, neither has incentive to deviate.

Moreover, **you can achieve 10 points in a stable equilibrium** by playing A2 with probability 1.

Is there a way to guarantee more?

Suppose you play A2 with probability 1.

Then opponent, if rational, will play A2 (to get 10), because:

- If they play A0: they would get 0 (because you play A1, they play A0)
- A1: get 4
- A2: get 10

So they choose A2.

Then you get 10.

Can you ever get more than 10?

Only if you could force the opponent to play A0, but they won't unless forced.

But if you play A1 when they play A0, you get 20, but they can avoid that.

So maximum you can guarantee is 10.

Could you mix to sometimes get more?

Suppose you play A2 with 90%, A0 with 10%.

Then if opponent is playing A2:
- With 90% chance: you delegate → you get A1 (since only you) → opponent plays A1 → you get 4
- With 10% chance: you play A0 → opponent plays A1 → you get 2
→ expected payoff = 0.9×4 + 0.1×2 = 3.6 + 0.2 = 3.8 < 10

Worse.

If you play a mixture including A1, but then if opponent plays A2, you get only 4.

So no.

Thus, the best you can do is play A2 with 100% probability.

Then, assuming the opponent is rational, they will respond with A2, and you get 10.

And you cannot improve beyond that in a Nash equilibrium.

Moreover, since the game is symmetric, and (A2,A2) is an equilibrium, and gives you 10 points.

Any other strategy gives you less or risks less.

Even though theoretically you could get 20 if the opponent plays A0, but they won't play A0 because they can get 10 by playing A2.

So the safe, optimal strategy is to play A2 with 100%.

response:
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the game without delegation

We are Player 2 in a 2-player simultaneous-move game. The original actions are A0 and A1, with payoff matrix (as Player 2):

|        | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | (10, 10) | (2, 6) |
| **P2 A1** | (20, 0)  | (4, 4) |

But now, **you (Player 2)** have an **extra option**: A2 = "Delegate to Mediator".

There is a mediator that acts based on how many players delegate to it:
- If **only 1** player delegates → mediator plays A1
- If **both players** delegate → mediator plays A0

So the mediator’s choice depends on whether *you* delegate and whether *Player 1* delegates.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the effects of delegation

We must decide whether to delegate (A2), or play A0 or A1.

Let’s denote:

- Player 1 chooses an action: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)
- You (Player 2) choose A0, A1, or A2.

But crucially: **Player 1 has already chosen the mediator**, and it’s **approved**, so the mediator's rules are fixed.

Player 1 could also delegate or not, independently.

So the **mediator’s behavior depends on the total number of delegations**.

Let’s consider what happens in each case:

---

### Case 1: You **delegate (A2)**

Then:
- If Player 1 **does not delegate**, total delegations = 1 → mediator plays **A1** for you.
- If Player 1 **does delegate**, total delegations = 2 → mediator plays **A0** for you.

So:
- If you delegate and P1 abstains → you get outcome based on (you: A1, P1: A0) → you get **20**, P1 gets 0
- If you delegate and P1 also delegates → you get (you: A0, P1: A0) → you get **10**, P1 gets 10

Now, what if **you don’t delegate**?

You choose A0 or A1 directly.

But Player 1 can also choose to delegate.

So we need to analyze this strategically.

---

### Step 3: Model Player 1's behavior?

Wait — **you are only responsible for your own strategy**. You do not know Player 1’s strategy. But in game theory, you must assume rationality and try to find a Nash equilibrium or best response.

However, since this is a decision-making game with you trying to **maximize your own points**, and the setup is symmetric in structure (but not in rules), and Player 1 proposed the mediator, we should consider how Player 1 might behave.

Let’s assume **both players are rational** and want to maximize their own payoffs.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies, including the possibility of delegation.

---

### Step 4: Consider all possible combinations

Let’s analyze the options **from your perspective**, and ask: **What is your best response to each possible action by Player 1?**

But since we don't know P1’s strategy, we must either assume a symmetric equilibrium or consider all possibilities.

Let’s suppose the game is symmetric — but it's **not** symmetric because the mediator's rule depends on the number of delegators, and the payoffs are asymmetric.

Let’s consider the **possible scenarios** based on delegation:

---

### Scenario 1: Both players delegate (A2)

→ Mediator gets 2 delegations → plays A0 for both.

So both get: (A0 vs A0) → **10 points each**

---

### Scenario 2: You delegate, P1 does **not**

→ Mediator gets 1 delegate → plays A1 for **you**.

So: you play A1, P1 plays whatever he plays.

P1 did not delegate → he chose A0 or A1.

But P1 might be rational and want to maximize his own payoff.

But in this case: you are delegating → you play A1.

So the outcome depends on P1's action.

- If P1 plays A0: (you A1, P1 A0) → you get 20, P1 gets 0
- If P1 plays A1: (you A1, P1 A1) → you get 4, P1 gets 4

But P1 knows that if he plays A0, he gets 0 (bad), so he would prefer to play A1 → get 4.

So **if you delegate and P1 doesn’t**, P1 will choose A1 for himself → outcome: you: 4, P1: 4

Wait — but let’s think: is this consistent?

Yes — if P1 knows you are delegating and thus playing A1, then:
- If P1 plays A0 → he gets 0
- If P1 plays A1 → he gets 4

So P1 will play A1.

Thus: if you delegate and P1 chooses not to delegate → P1 plays A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get **4**, P1 gets 4

---

### Scenario 3: You don't delegate, P1 delegates

Then: mediator has 1 delegate → plays A1 for **P1**.

So P1 is playing A1.

You play A0 or A1.

If you play A0: you A0, P1 A1 → you get 2, P1 gets 6

If you play A1: you A1, P1 A1 → you get 4, P1 gets 4

So you will choose A1 (get 4 > 2)

So: if P1 delegates and you don’t delegate → you play A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4, P1 gets 4

---

### Scenario 4: Neither delegates

Then both play directly.

So you and P1 choose A0 or A1.

We already know this is the base game.

Expected payoff depends on both choices.

But now we come to the **critical point**: what’s the best strategy for each player?

Let’s find **Nash equilibria**, including delegation.

---

### Step 5: Find symmetric or plausible equilibria

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their payoffs.

Let’s first consider **all players delegating**.

- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → 10, 10

Would either player want to deviate?

Suppose you are in this state: both delegating → you get 10.

Can you improve by **not delegating**?

If you don’t delegate, but Player 1 still delegates → mediator has 1 delegate → plays A1 for P1.

So P1 plays A1.

Now you can choose A0 or A1.

If you play A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4 < 10 → worse

If you play A0 → (A0, A1) → you get 2 < 10 → worse

So deviating lowers your payoff → so **you have no incentive to deviate**.

Now check: if Player 1 considers deviating from delegation (while you delegate), what happens?

- Currently: both delegate → P1 gets 10
- If P1 stops delegating → he plays directly
- You are still delegating → so you play A1 (since only 1 delegate)
- So P1, if he plays A0 → (A1, A0) → he gets 0
- If he plays A1 → (A1, A1) → he gets 4
- So he plays A1 → gets 4 < 10 → worse

Thus, P1 also has no incentive to deviate.

✅ So (both delegate) is a **Nash equilibrium** → payoff 10 each.

Is this the **only one**?

Let’s check another possibility.

---

### Try: Neither delegates

Then both play A0 or A1 directly.

Let’s find pure strategy Nash equilibria in this subgame.

Payoff matrix again (you are Player 2):

|        | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | (10,10) | (2,6) |
| **P2 A1** | (20,0) | (4,4) |

Check for pure strategy NE:

- (A0, A0): (10,10). If P1 deviates to A1 → gets 6 < 10 → no
  If P2 deviates to A1 → gets 20 > 10 → **yes**, so P2 wants to deviate → not NE

- (A0, A1): P2 gets 2, P1 gets 6
  P2: if deviates to A1 → (A1, A1) → gets 4 > 2 → wants to deviate → no

- (A1, A0): P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0
  P1: if deviates to A1 → (A1, A1) → gets 4 > 0 → wants to deviate → no

- (A1, A1): (4,4). P2: deviating to A0 → gets 2 < 4 → no
  P1: deviating to A0 → gets 0 < 4 → no

✅ So (A1, A1) is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium** → payoff 4 each.

So both players getting 4 if both play A1 directly.

Now, is this sustainable?

But earlier we found that (both delegate) gives 10 each → **better than 4**

So why would anyone choose the A1-A1 outcome?

Unless they don't trust the mediator.

But in equilibrium, both would prefer 10 over 4.

So (both delegate) is a better equilibrium.

But can we have asymmetric equilibria?

Try: You delegate, P1 doesn’t.

Then, as shown earlier, P1 will play A1 (to avoid getting 0), and you are forced to play A1 via mediator (since only 1 delegate) → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4

But if you were not delegating, and P1 delegates, then P1 plays A1, and you would play A1 → you get 4

But if you delegate and P1 doesn't, you get 4, same as not delegating.

But if both delegate, you get 10.

So **you would prefer both to delegate**.

But if P1 is rational, and you are going to delegate, P1 will get 10 (by delegating) vs only 4 if he doesn’t.

So both have incentive to delegate.

Now: what if only one delegates?

- Suppose P1 delegates, you don’t.
  Then: mediator plays A1 for P1.
  You can choose A0 or A1.

  - A0: (A0, A1) → you get 2
  - A1: (A1, A1) → you get 4 → so you choose A1

  P1, with delegation: gets 4 (from (A1, A1))

  But if P1 had not delegated, and you also didn’t delegate, they could have both played A0 → get 10.

  But can they coordinate?

  But since P1 already chose to delegate (and you can’t stop him), and if he delegates, he gets 4 regardless of your action.

  But if P1 had chosen not to delegate, and you also not, they could be in (A0, A0) → 10.

But P1 knows: if he doesn't delegate, and you are planning to not delegate either, then yes, 10.

But if you are going to delegate, and P1 doesn’t, then P1 gets 0 (if he plays A0) or 4 (if A1) → so he plays A1 → gets 4.

So P1 will only delegate if he believes he will get at least 4, but if he doesn’t delegate, and you don’t, he can get 10.

So P1 would **prefer not to delegate**, **if he thinks you won’t delegate**.

But if he thinks you will delegate, then he gets 4 if he delegates, or 0/4 if he doesn’t — so he still prefers delegating? Wait.

Let’s suppose P1 thinks you will **delegating**.

Then:
- If P1 delegates → mediator plays A0 for P1 (since 2 delegations) → P1 plays A0.
  You: A1 (since only 1 delegate) → outcome: (A1, A0) → P1 gets 0

- If P1 does **not** delegate → he plays directly.
  If he plays A0 → gets 0
  If he plays A1 → gets 4

So P1 plays A1 → gets 4

So P1 gets 0 if he delegates, 4 if he doesn’t → so he **prefers not to delegate**.

Thus, if P1 thinks you will delegate, then P1 will **not delegate** and play A1.

Similarly, if you think P1 will not delegate, then:

- If you delegate → you play A1 (1 delegate), P1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4
- If you don’t delegate → you can play A1 → get 4
- Or A0 → get 2

So you get 4 either way → you’re indifferent.

But if you delegate, and P1 chooses not to, you get 4

But if **both** delegate → you get 10

So to get that 10, you need P1 to delegate.

But P1 only gets 0 if he delegates and you delegate → because then he plays A0, you play A1 → (A1, A0) → P1 gets 0

And if P1 doesn’t delegate, he can get 4

So P1 **will never** want to delegate **if you delegate**.

Therefore, **if you delegate**, P1 will not delegate → then you get 4

But if you don’t delegate, and P1 doesn’t delegate, then you might both play A1 → you get 4

Or if you play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 10

But can you coordinate?

But the point is: **you cannot force P1 to delegate**, because if you do, P1 will get 0, so he won’t.

So the only way for **both** to get 10 is **both delegate** → but that requires P1 to **want** to delegate even though he gets 0 in that case?

Wait — no:

Let’s clarify:

If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 for both → A0 vs A0 → both get 10

So if **both delegate**, **P1 gets 10**

That's **much better** than 0 or 4

So P1 **would want** to delegate **if both delegate**

But can he know that you will delegate?

Let’s suppose both players are rational and know that (both delegate) leads to 10 each.

But if P1 thinks you **will** delegate, then he faces:

- If he delegates → both delegate → A0 → he gets 10
- If he doesn't delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 for you → you play A1
  P1 plays A1 → gets 4

So 10 > 4 → P1 **prefers to delegate**

Similarly, if you think P1 will delegate, then:
- You delegate → both delegate → you play A0 → get 10
- You don’t delegate → P1 plays A0 → if you play A0 → get 10, same

But if you play A1 → get 20 if P1 plays A0 → that’s tempting!

Wait — that’s interesting.

Let’s organize this.

---

### Critical Re-examination

Suppose **P1 will delegate**.

Then:
- If you delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → you get 10

- If you **do not** delegate → P1 plays A0 (mediator → A0), so P1 plays A0
  Then you can choose:
    - A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10
    - A1 → (A1, A0) → you get 20

So **you can get 20** if you play A1 and P1 plays A0.

So if P1 delegates, and you don’t, you can get 20 by playing A1.

But P1 doesn’t know this! But he might.

So if P1 believes you will not delegate, he can still get 10 by delegating.

But if P1 delegates, and you **don’t**, you will **play A1** (to get 20), so outcome: (A1, A0) → P1 gets 0

Oh! So **if P1 delegates**, and you don’t, you **can** get 20 → but only if you play A1

But if P1 plays A0, and you play A1 → P1 gets 0

So P1 gets 0 → very bad

Therefore, if P1 delegates, and you are not delegating, you will play A1 → P1 gets 0

So P1 would prefer to **not delegate**, because if he delegates, he gets 0 (if you play A1), but if he doesn’t, he can play A1 and get 4 (if you also play A1), or A0 and get 10 (if you play A0)

But if you are not delegating, and P1 threatens to delegate → you’ll play A1 → he gets 0

So P1 will avoid delegating.

But then you get only 4 from (A1, A1), or 2 from (A0, A1)

So you won’t get 10.

But if **P1 does not delegate**, and you **do**, then you play A1, P1 plays A0 or A1.

But yes: if P1 doesn’t delegate, and you delegate → you play A1, P1 can choose:
- A0 → you get 20, P1 gets 0
- A1 → you get 4, P1 gets 4

P1 will pick A1 → gets

Your previous response was:
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the game without delegation

We are Player 2 in a 2-player simultaneous-move game. The original actions are A0 and A1, with payoff matrix (as Player 2):

|        | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | (10, 10) | (2, 6) |
| **P2 A1** | (20, 0)  | (4, 4) |

But now, **you (Player 2)** have an **extra option**: A2 = "Delegate to Mediator".

There is a mediator that acts based on how many players delegate to it:
- If **only 1** player delegates → mediator plays A1
- If **both players** delegate → mediator plays A0

So the mediator’s choice depends on whether *you* delegate and whether *Player 1* delegates.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the effects of delegation

We must decide whether to delegate (A2), or play A0 or A1.

Let’s denote:

- Player 1 chooses an action: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)
- You (Player 2) choose A0, A1, or A2.

But crucially: **Player 1 has already chosen the mediator**, and it’s **approved**, so the mediator's rules are fixed.

Player 1 could also delegate or not, independently.

So the **mediator’s behavior depends on the total number of delegations**.

Let’s consider what happens in each case:

---

### Case 1: You **delegate (A2)**

Then:
- If Player 1 **does not delegate**, total delegations = 1 → mediator plays **A1** for you.
- If Player 1 **does delegate**, total delegations = 2 → mediator plays **A0** for you.

So:
- If you delegate and P1 abstains → you get outcome based on (you: A1, P1: A0) → you get **20**, P1 gets 0
- If you delegate and P1 also delegates → you get (you: A0, P1: A0) → you get **10**, P1 gets 10

Now, what if **you don’t delegate**?

You choose A0 or A1 directly.

But Player 1 can also choose to delegate.

So we need to analyze this strategically.

---

### Step 3: Model Player 1's behavior?

Wait — **you are only responsible for your own strategy**. You do not know Player 1’s strategy. But in game theory, you must assume rationality and try to find a Nash equilibrium or best response.

However, since this is a decision-making game with you trying to **maximize your own points**, and the setup is symmetric in structure (but not in rules), and Player 1 proposed the mediator, we should consider how Player 1 might behave.

Let’s assume **both players are rational** and want to maximize their own payoffs.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies, including the possibility of delegation.

---

### Step 4: Consider all possible combinations

Let’s analyze the options **from your perspective**, and ask: **What is your best response to each possible action by Player 1?**

But since we don't know P1’s strategy, we must either assume a symmetric equilibrium or consider all possibilities.

Let’s suppose the game is symmetric — but it's **not** symmetric because the mediator's rule depends on the number of delegators, and the payoffs are asymmetric.

Let’s consider the **possible scenarios** based on delegation:

---

### Scenario 1: Both players delegate (A2)

→ Mediator gets 2 delegations → plays A0 for both.

So both get: (A0 vs A0) → **10 points each**

---

### Scenario 2: You delegate, P1 does **not**

→ Mediator gets 1 delegate → plays A1 for **you**.

So: you play A1, P1 plays whatever he plays.

P1 did not delegate → he chose A0 or A1.

But P1 might be rational and want to maximize his own payoff.

But in this case: you are delegating → you play A1.

So the outcome depends on P1's action.

- If P1 plays A0: (you A1, P1 A0) → you get 20, P1 gets 0
- If P1 plays A1: (you A1, P1 A1) → you get 4, P1 gets 4

But P1 knows that if he plays A0, he gets 0 (bad), so he would prefer to play A1 → get 4.

So **if you delegate and P1 doesn’t**, P1 will choose A1 for himself → outcome: you: 4, P1: 4

Wait — but let’s think: is this consistent?

Yes — if P1 knows you are delegating and thus playing A1, then:
- If P1 plays A0 → he gets 0
- If P1 plays A1 → he gets 4

So P1 will play A1.

Thus: if you delegate and P1 chooses not to delegate → P1 plays A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get **4**, P1 gets 4

---

### Scenario 3: You don't delegate, P1 delegates

Then: mediator has 1 delegate → plays A1 for **P1**.

So P1 is playing A1.

You play A0 or A1.

If you play A0: you A0, P1 A1 → you get 2, P1 gets 6

If you play A1: you A1, P1 A1 → you get 4, P1 gets 4

So you will choose A1 (get 4 > 2)

So: if P1 delegates and you don’t delegate → you play A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4, P1 gets 4

---

### Scenario 4: Neither delegates

Then both play directly.

So you and P1 choose A0 or A1.

We already know this is the base game.

Expected payoff depends on both choices.

But now we come to the **critical point**: what’s the best strategy for each player?

Let’s find **Nash equilibria**, including delegation.

---

### Step 5: Find symmetric or plausible equilibria

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their payoffs.

Let’s first consider **all players delegating**.

- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → 10, 10

Would either player want to deviate?

Suppose you are in this state: both delegating → you get 10.

Can you improve by **not delegating**?

If you don’t delegate, but Player 1 still delegates → mediator has 1 delegate → plays A1 for P1.

So P1 plays A1.

Now you can choose A0 or A1.

If you play A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4 < 10 → worse

If you play A0 → (A0, A1) → you get 2 < 10 → worse

So deviating lowers your payoff → so **you have no incentive to deviate**.

Now check: if Player 1 considers deviating from delegation (while you delegate), what happens?

- Currently: both delegate → P1 gets 10
- If P1 stops delegating → he plays directly
- You are still delegating → so you play A1 (since only 1 delegate)
- So P1, if he plays A0 → (A1, A0) → he gets 0
- If he plays A1 → (A1, A1) → he gets 4
- So he plays A1 → gets 4 < 10 → worse

Thus, P1 also has no incentive to deviate.

✅ So (both delegate) is a **Nash equilibrium** → payoff 10 each.

Is this the **only one**?

Let’s check another possibility.

---

### Try: Neither delegates

Then both play A0 or A1 directly.

Let’s find pure strategy Nash equilibria in this subgame.

Payoff matrix again (you are Player 2):

|        | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | (10,10) | (2,6) |
| **P2 A1** | (20,0) | (4,4) |

Check for pure strategy NE:

- (A0, A0): (10,10). If P1 deviates to A1 → gets 6 < 10 → no
  If P2 deviates to A1 → gets 20 > 10 → **yes**, so P2 wants to deviate → not NE

- (A0, A1): P2 gets 2, P1 gets 6
  P2: if deviates to A1 → (A1, A1) → gets 4 > 2 → wants to deviate → no

- (A1, A0): P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0
  P1: if deviates to A1 → (A1, A1) → gets 4 > 0 → wants to deviate → no

- (A1, A1): (4,4). P2: deviating to A0 → gets 2 < 4 → no
  P1: deviating to A0 → gets 0 < 4 → no

✅ So (A1, A1) is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium** → payoff 4 each.

So both players getting 4 if both play A1 directly.

Now, is this sustainable?

But earlier we found that (both delegate) gives 10 each → **better than 4**

So why would anyone choose the A1-A1 outcome?

Unless they don't trust the mediator.

But in equilibrium, both would prefer 10 over 4.

So (both delegate) is a better equilibrium.

But can we have asymmetric equilibria?

Try: You delegate, P1 doesn’t.

Then, as shown earlier, P1 will play A1 (to avoid getting 0), and you are forced to play A1 via mediator (since only 1 delegate) → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4

But if you were not delegating, and P1 delegates, then P1 plays A1, and you would play A1 → you get 4

But if you delegate and P1 doesn't, you get 4, same as not delegating.

But if both delegate, you get 10.

So **you would prefer both to delegate**.

But if P1 is rational, and you are going to delegate, P1 will get 10 (by delegating) vs only 4 if he doesn’t.

So both have incentive to delegate.

Now: what if only one delegates?

- Suppose P1 delegates, you don’t.
  Then: mediator plays A1 for P1.
  You can choose A0 or A1.

  - A0: (A0, A1) → you get 2
  - A1: (A1, A1) → you get 4 → so you choose A1

  P1, with delegation: gets 4 (from (A1, A1))

  But if P1 had not delegated, and you also didn’t delegate, they could have both played A0 → get 10.

  But can they coordinate?

  But since P1 already chose to delegate (and you can’t stop him), and if he delegates, he gets 4 regardless of your action.

  But if P1 had chosen not to delegate, and you also not, they could be in (A0, A0) → 10.

But P1 knows: if he doesn't delegate, and you are planning to not delegate either, then yes, 10.

But if you are going to delegate, and P1 doesn’t, then P1 gets 0 (if he plays A0) or 4 (if A1) → so he plays A1 → gets 4.

So P1 will only delegate if he believes he will get at least 4, but if he doesn’t delegate, and you don’t, he can get 10.

So P1 would **prefer not to delegate**, **if he thinks you won’t delegate**.

But if he thinks you will delegate, then he gets 4 if he delegates, or 0/4 if he doesn’t — so he still prefers delegating? Wait.

Let’s suppose P1 thinks you will **delegating**.

Then:
- If P1 delegates → mediator plays A0 for P1 (since 2 delegations) → P1 plays A0.
  You: A1 (since only 1 delegate) → outcome: (A1, A0) → P1 gets 0

- If P1 does **not** delegate → he plays directly.
  If he plays A0 → gets 0
  If he plays A1 → gets 4

So P1 plays A1 → gets 4

So P1 gets 0 if he delegates, 4 if he doesn’t → so he **prefers not to delegate**.

Thus, if P1 thinks you will delegate, then P1 will **not delegate** and play A1.

Similarly, if you think P1 will not delegate, then:

- If you delegate → you play A1 (1 delegate), P1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4
- If you don’t delegate → you can play A1 → get 4
- Or A0 → get 2

So you get 4 either way → you’re indifferent.

But if you delegate, and P1 chooses not to, you get 4

But if **both** delegate → you get 10

So to get that 10, you need P1 to delegate.

But P1 only gets 0 if he delegates and you delegate → because then he plays A0, you play A1 → (A1, A0) → P1 gets 0

And if P1 doesn’t delegate, he can get 4

So P1 **will never** want to delegate **if you delegate**.

Therefore, **if you delegate**, P1 will not delegate → then you get 4

But if you don’t delegate, and P1 doesn’t delegate, then you might both play A1 → you get 4

Or if you play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 10

But can you coordinate?

But the point is: **you cannot force P1 to delegate**, because if you do, P1 will get 0, so he won’t.

So the only way for **both** to get 10 is **both delegate** → but that requires P1 to **want** to delegate even though he gets 0 in that case?

Wait — no:

Let’s clarify:

If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 for both → A0 vs A0 → both get 10

So if **both delegate**, **P1 gets 10**

That's **much better** than 0 or 4

So P1 **would want** to delegate **if both delegate**

But can he know that you will delegate?

Let’s suppose both players are rational and know that (both delegate) leads to 10 each.

But if P1 thinks you **will** delegate, then he faces:

- If he delegates → both delegate → A0 → he gets 10
- If he doesn't delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 for you → you play A1
  P1 plays A1 → gets 4

So 10 > 4 → P1 **prefers to delegate**

Similarly, if you think P1 will delegate, then:
- You delegate → both delegate → you play A0 → get 10
- You don’t delegate → P1 plays A0 → if you play A0 → get 10, same

But if you play A1 → get 20 if P1 plays A0 → that’s tempting!

Wait — that’s interesting.

Let’s organize this.

---

### Critical Re-examination

Suppose **P1 will delegate**.

Then:
- If you delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → you get 10

- If you **do not** delegate → P1 plays A0 (mediator → A0), so P1 plays A0
  Then you can choose:
    - A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10
    - A1 → (A1, A0) → you get 20

So **you can get 20** if you play A1 and P1 plays A0.

So if P1 delegates, and you don’t, you can get 20 by playing A1.

But P1 doesn’t know this! But he might.

So if P1 believes you will not delegate, he can still get 10 by delegating.

But if P1 delegates, and you **don’t**, you will **play A1** (to get 20), so outcome: (A1, A0) → P1 gets 0

Oh! So **if P1 delegates**, and you don’t, you **can** get 20 → but only if you play A1

But if P1 plays A0, and you play A1 → P1 gets 0

So P1 gets 0 → very bad

Therefore, if P1 delegates, and you are not delegating, you will play A1 → P1 gets 0

So P1 would prefer to **not delegate**, because if he delegates, he gets 0 (if you play A1), but if he doesn’t, he can play A1 and get 4 (if you also play A1), or A0 and get 10 (if you play A0)

But if you are not delegating, and P1 threatens to delegate → you’ll play A1 → he gets 0

So P1 will avoid delegating.

But then you get only 4 from (A1, A1), or 2 from (A0, A1)

So you won’t get 10.

But if **P1 does not delegate**, and you **do**, then you play A1, P1 plays A0 or A1.

But yes: if P1 doesn’t delegate, and you delegate → you play A1, P1 can choose:
- A0 → you get 20, P1 gets 0
- A1 → you get 4, P1 gets 4

P1 will pick A1 → gets 

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in the response 'Let\'s break this problem down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the game without delegation\n\nWe are Player 2 in a 2-player simultaneous-move game.

response:
Let's carefully re-analyze the game from the perspective of Player 2 (you), with the goal of maximizing your expected points, given that:

- You can choose to play A0, A1, or A2 (Delegate to Mediator).
- The mediator plays:
  - A1 if only one player delegates.
  - A0 if both players delegate.
- Player 1 is rational and also wants to maximize their own payoff.
- You must choose a mixed strategy (probabilities over A0, A1, A2) that is a best response in a Nash equilibrium.

---

### Step 1: Understand the outcomes based on delegation

Let’s define the four possible delegation combinations:

#### Case 1: Both players delegate (A2, A2)
- Mediator has 2 delegates → plays A0 for both.
- Outcome: (A0, A0) → you get **10**.

#### Case 2: You delegate (A2), Player 1 does **not**
- Mediator has 1 delegate → plays A1 for you.
- You play A1.
- Player 1 plays directly (A0 or A1).
  - If P1 plays A0 → (A1, A0) → you get 20, P1 gets 0.
  - If P1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4, P1 gets 4.
- P1, being rational, will choose A1 to avoid 0 → gets 4.
- So you get **4**.

#### Case 3: You do **not** delegate, Player 1 delegates (A2)
- Mediator has 1 delegate → plays A1 for P1.
- P1 plays A1.
- You play A0 or A1:
  - A0 → (A0, A1) → you get 2, P1 gets 6.
  - A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4, P1 gets 4.
- You choose A1 → you get **4**.

#### Case 4: Neither delegates
- Both choose A0 or A1 directly.
- The only pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this subgame is (A1, A1), yielding **4** for you.
- (A0, A0) is not stable because you would deviate to A1 to get 20.
- (A1, A0) is not stable because P1 would deviate to A1.
- So rational play leads to (A1, A1) → you get **4**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze incentives — can (both delegate) be an equilibrium?

Suppose both players are contemplating delegating.

- If **you** delegate, and **P1 delegates**, you get 10.
- But if **you** delegate, and P1 does **not**, you get **4**.
- If **you** do **not** delegate, and P1 delegates, you get 4.
- If neither delegates, you get 4.

But **if P1 delegates**, you get 10 only if you also delegate.

But if you delegate, P1 gets:
- 10 if he also delegates.
- 0 if he doesn't (because you are delegating → you play A1, and if he plays A0 → he gets 0).

So P1 will **only** delegate if he thinks you will delegate.

But if P1 thinks you will delegate, he should delegate to get 10 vs 0.

So here's the key: **mutual delegation yields 10 each, which is better than any other outcome (4 or 0).**

Now, suppose you are not delegating. Then:
- If you play A0: (A0, A0) → you get 10.
- But P1 can deviate to A1 → (A0, A1) → P1 gets 6, you get 2.
- P1 won’t do that if you both play A0, but you don’t know if he will.

Actually, without delegation, the only stable outcome is (A1, A1) → 4.

But the **only** way to get 10 is through both delegating.

So can (both delegate) be an equilibrium?

Yes — if both believe the other will delegate, then:
- You get 10 → better than 4.
- P1 gets 10 → better than 4.
- So neither wants to deviate.

But is this credible?

Wait: **If you delegate**, and P1 does **not**, then you get 4.
But if **P1 delegates**, and you do, you get 10.

So for P1, if he thinks you will delegate, he gets 10 by delegating, 4 by not → so he **wants to delegate**.

Similarly, **if you think P1 will delegate**, you get:
- 10 if you delegate.
- 10 if you play A0 (since P1 plays A0), or 20 if you play A1.

Ah — **critical point**:
If P1 delegates → P1 plays A0.

Then you, as Player 2:
- Can play A0 → (A0, A0) → get 10.
- Or play A1 → (A1, A0) → get 20.

So **if you believe P1 will delegate**, you will **play A1** to get 20.

But if you play A1, and P1 plays A0, P1 gets 0.

So P1 gets 0 if he delegates and you don’t.

So P1, if he thinks you will not delegate, will not delegate.

But if he thinks you will delegate, he must choose: delegate and get 10, or not delegate and get 0 (if you play A1).

So if **you commit to delegating**, then P1 gets 0 if he delegates? No — if you delegate and he delegates, he plays A0, you play A0 → he gets 10.

But if **you delegate**, then P1 gets:
- 10 if he **delegates** (outcome A0 vs A0).
- 0 if he **does not delegate** and plays A0 → because you play A1 → (A1, A0) → he gets 0.
- 4 if he does not delegate and plays A1.

So if **you delegate**, P1 will get:
- 10 if he delegates.
- 0 (if he plays A0) or 4 (if he plays A1) if he doesn’t.

So he will choose to delegate → get 10.

Therefore, if **you delegate**, P1 will also delegate → both get 10.

But if **you don’t delegate**, and P1 delegates, then P1 gets 4 (from (A1, A1) — you play A1), and you get 4.

But if **you don’t delegate**, and P1 doesn’t delegate, you might end up in (A1, A1) → 4.

So the only way to get 10 is to **both delegate**.

And the key is: **if you delegate, P1 will also delegate**, because it gives him 10 > 4.

So **both delegating is a self-confirming equilibrium**.

But now, suppose you consider not delegating. You can get:
- At best 10, if P1 plays A0 and you play A0.
- But P1 will only play A0 if he wants to, which is only if you don’t play A1.

But if you play A0 and P1 plays A0 → you get 10.

But P1 knows that if he plays A0, and you play A1, he gets 0 — so he won’t play A0 unless he believes you’ll play A0.

So to get 10, you need coordination.

But with delegation, you can **commit** to a strategy (possibly) that leads to the high payoff.

But here’s the twist: **if you delegate**, you **induce** the outcome **A0**, because when both delegate, mediator plays A0.

And **P1 knows that**.

So if **you delegate**, P1 knows:
- If he delegates → both play A0 → he gets 10.
- If he doesn’t → you play A1 (since only 1 delegate), and he can play A1 → get 4, or A0 → get 0.

So he chooses to delegate → gets 10.

So you can **force** both to get 10 by simply delegating.

And if you do not delegate, you can at best get 10 if you play A0 and P1 plays A0, but P1 has no reason to play A0 — he prefers to play A1 and get 4.

The only stable outcome without delegation is (A1, A1) → 4.

So **delegating gives you a guaranteed 10** (because P1 will follow suit), while not delegating gives you at most 10 with no guarantee.

But wait: **if you delegate, you get exactly 10 — no risk**.

And since P1 will not deviate (because 10 > 4), it's stable.

Now, what if you play A1 or A0 instead?

- If you play A0: P1 can deviate to A1 → you get 2.
- If you play A1: P1 will play A1 → you get 4.

So playing A0 or A1 gives you **at most 4** in equilibrium, but you might get less.

But **delegating** gives you 10.

So **your best strategy is to delegate**.

But is this a mixed strategy?

You are asked to choose a **probability distribution** over A0, A1, A2.

But if **delegating gives you 10**, and all other pure strategies give you only 4 or less, then you should **always delegate**.

But let’s verify:

- If you **always delegate (A2 with 100%)**:
  - P1, knowing you delegate, will delegate → you get 10.
  - P1 gets 10 → so he has no incentive to deviate.

So it is a **Nash equilibrium**: both players delegate.

And you get 10.

Any deviation by you gives you at most 4 (if you don’t delegate and P1 plays A1).

So you strictly prefer delegating.

Therefore, your **optimal strategy is to always delegate**.

---

### Final Answer:

You should always choose A2: Delegate to the Mediator.

Thus, probabilities are:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

response:
To determine which mediators to approve, we need to analyze the potential outcomes and strategies for maximizing points based on the given rules and payoffs.

### Payoff Matrix Analysis
Let's review the payoff for each combination of actions chosen by Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2):
- \( (A0, A0) \): P1 = 10 points, P2 = 10 points
- \( (A0, A1) \): P1 = 0 points, P2 = 20 points
- \( (A1, A0) \): P1 = 6 points, P2 = 2 points
- \( (A1, A1) \): P1 = 4 points, P2 = 4 points

Given these payoffs, each player has to decide whether to collaborate or to try and maximize their own individual points potentially at the expense of the other player. The Nash Equilibrium here would be \( (A1, A1) \), yielding 4 points each, as neither player can unilaterally improve their score.

### Mediators Analysis
There are two proposed mediators, both with the same rules:
- If 1 player delegates, play A1.
- If 2 players delegate, play A0.

If both players delegate to the mediator:
- Both play A0 -> Each gets 10 points

If only one player delegates to the mediator:
- Mediator plays A1 against either \( A0 \) or \( A1 \)

Considering both players will prefer a better outcome, mutual delegation seems rational because it offers a guaranteed 10 points each, which is higher than any individual action choice can guarantee.

### Approval Decision
Both mediators are identical in strategy, and both provide an advantage by ensuring a higher possible outcome through mutual delegation. Therefore, approving both makes sense as it doesn't matter which one is chosen at random.

### Approval JSON Output
Given this analysis, we would approve both mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2:

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}
```

This ensures that the mediator choice would consistently favor mutual delegation leading to the action \( (A0, A0) \), maximizing mutual gain (10 points each).

response:
To determine the best strategy for deciding whether to approve mediators in this game, we first need to analyze the outcomes based on different scenarios and consider how the mediators' actions affect our payoffs.

### Analyzing Payoffs

1. **Independent Actions**:
    - If both players act independently, we must consider the payoffs:
        - (A0, A0) → (10, 10)
        - (A0, A1) → (0, 20)
        - (A1, A0) → (6, 2)
        - (A1, A1) → (4, 4)
    - We need to consider mixed strategies (i.e., probabilities of choosing actions) to maximize expected payoffs but this primarily becomes a coordination game.

2. **Mediator Actions**:
   - Both mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 have similar strategies:
       - If 1 player delegates: Mediator will play A1.
       - If 2 players delegate: Mediator will play A0.

3. **With 1 Player Delegating**:
   - If one player delegates and the other doesn't:
       - Delegated action will be A1.
       - Non-delegated player's best response could be either A1 or A0.
       - Potential outcomes:
           - (A1, A0) → (6, 2) if you were the non-delegated player.
           - (A0, A1) → (0, 20) if you were the non-delegated player.
       - In theory, if the non-delegated player anticipates the other (delegated) playing A1, their best selfish response might be A0 for higher payoff (20).

4. **With 2 Players Delegating**:
   - If both players delegate, the mediator will play A0 for both:
       - Outcome will be (A0, A0) → (10, 10)

### Evaluating Mediators Based on Delegation Scenarios

Given both mediators operate identically:
- In cases where **both players delegate**, we can expect a payoff of (10, 10).
- In cases where **only one player delegates**, the delegate will play A1 and potential outcomes depend on the non-delegated player’s choice.

### Conclusion

Given the uniform strategy for mediators and their potential to yield the cooperative payoff (10, 10) when both players delegate, it is beneficial to approve both mediators proposed by both players. This symmetric acceptance increases the likelihood of both players endorsing the same mediator, thus facilitating the cooperative (A0, A0) outcome.

### Output

```json
{
    "M1": true,
    "M2": true
}
```

This approval ensures you are open to cooperation mediated play, aiming for the higher mutual payoff potential of (10, 10).

response:
To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the mediators based on how well they help in maximizing the points for Player 1 (us) in the game. Let's break this down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoffs

Here are the points again:
- If both choose A0: Player 1 gets 10, Player 2 gets 10.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 20.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 6, Player 2 gets 2.
- If both choose A1: Player 1 gets 4, Player 2 gets 4.

### Step 2: Evaluating the Mediators

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **If 1 player delegates**: It will play action A1.
- **If 2 players delegate**: It will play action A0.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- **If 1 player delegates**: It will play action A0.
- **If 2 players delegate**: It will play action A0.

### Step 3: Scenario Analysis

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **If only I delegate**: 
  - The mediator will choose A1 for me. I need to consider what the other player might do:
    - If Player 2 chooses A0: I get 6 points.
    - If Player 2 chooses A1: I get 4 points.

  If Player 2 delegates too:
  - The mediator chooses A0 for both of us: Both get 10 points.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- **If only I delegate**:
  - The mediator will choose A0 for me. I need to consider what the other player might do:
    - If Player 2 chooses A0: I get 10 points.
    - If Player 2 chooses A1: I get 0 points.

  If Player 2 delegates too:
  - The mediator chooses A0 for both of us: Both get 10 points.

### Step 4: Compare Outcomes

- **Player 1’s Mediator**:
  - If both delegate: Both get 10 points.
  - If only I delegate: I get either 6 or 4 points, depending on the other player's action.

- **Player 2’s Mediator**:
  - If both delegate: Both get 10 points.
  - If only I delegate: I get either 10 or 0 points.

In both cases, if both delegate, the outcome is equally beneficial. However, if I delegate alone, the mediator proposed by Player 2 poses a risk where I could get 0 points if Player 2 takes advantage of it.

### Step 5: Making the Decision

Given the risks associated with the mediator proposed by Player 2, it's safer and more predictable to opt for the mediator suggested by Player 1, especially since both mediators result in the same outcome if both players delegate.

Thus, I would approve only the mediator proposed by Player 1.

response:
To decide which mediator to approve in the given game setup, we'll need to analyze the expected outcomes associated with each mediator. We'll break down the steps and examine the payoffs under different scenarios.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Review the Payoff Matrix:**
    - Both choose A0: You: 10 points, Them: 10 points.
    - You choose A0, They choose A1: You: 0 points, Them: 20 points.
    - You choose A1, They choose A0: You: 6 points, Them: 2 points.
    - Both choose A1: You: 4 points, Them: 4 points.

2. **Review Mediator Designs:**
    - **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
        - If 1 player delegates: Mediator plays A1.
        - If 2 players delegate: Mediator plays A0.
    - **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
        - Identical to Mediator from Player 1: 
        - If 1 player delegates: Mediator plays A1.
        - If 2 players delegate: Mediator plays A0.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
    - Both mediators play A1 if only one player delegates.
    - Both mediators play A0 if both players delegate.

4. **Decision Under Each Scenario:**

    - **Scenario 1: One Delegate**
        - Mediator plays A1, and the other player independently decides. 
        - If I delegate and the other player independently chooses:
            - Best response for them: They might play A0 for a better payoff (6 points), since my mediator plays A1.
        - Expected payoff:
            - Me: 6 points (delegate, other plays A0).
            - The other: 2 points.
            
        - If the other player delegates and I act independently:
            - I might play A0 to ensure the best response against their guaranteed A1.
        - Expected payoff:
            - Me: 0 points (I play A0, they delegate = A1).
            - The other: 20 points.

    - **Scenario 2: Both Delegate**
        - Both mediators will play A0.
        - Expected payoff:
            - Me: 10 points.
            - The other: 10 points.

5. **Strategic Outcomes:**
    - Assuming rational play, both might find it favorable to delegate, which results in coordination for A0.
    - Non-delegating can lead to potentially poor outcomes where one might be heavily incentivized to change to a pure strategy.

### Approval Decision:
Given that both mediators are essentially identical and lead to the same outcomes under all scenarios, approving both mediators is rational. This way, it ensures we don't have a bias towards one mediator over the other, giving room for a fair game.

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

This final decision shows approval for both mediators, considering their identical nature and balanced coordination incentives provided in the game setup.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:

response:
To approach this problem, we'll break it down into steps:
1. **Understand the Payoffs**: We'll start by analyzing each player's payoffs in different scenarios.
2. **Analyze Mediators' Strategies**: We'll review the proposed mediator strategies.
3. **Decision on Approval**: Based on the above analysis, we will determine which mediators to approve.

### Step 1: Understand the Payoffs
Let's restate the payoffs for better understanding:
- If both choose A0: Each gets 10 points.
- If you choose A1 and the opponent chooses A0: You get 20 points, opponent gets 0 points.
- If you choose A0 and the opponent chooses A1: You get 2 points, opponent gets 6 points.
- If both choose A1: Each gets 4 points.

### Step 2: Analyze Mediators' Strategies

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- If 1 player delegates, it will play A1.
- If 2 players delegate, it will play A0.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- If 1 player delegates, it will play A0.
- If 2 players delegate, it will play A0.

### Step 3: Decision on Approval

#### Mediator 1 Analysis:
- **1 delegate**: Plays A1.
   - If you delegate and Player 1 does not: You play A1, and risk getting 4 points (if Player 1 plays A1) or 20 points (if Player 1 plays A0).
   - If Player 1 delegates and you do not: You could independently get 6 points (if you play A0 and Mediator plays A1), or 4 points (if you play A1 and Mediator plays A1).
  
- **2 delegates**: Plays A0.
   - If both delegate: Both get 10 points.

#### Mediator 2 Analysis:
- **1 delegate**: Plays A0.
   - If you delegate and Player 1 does not: You play A0 and secure at least 6 points (if Player 1 plays A1) or 10 points (if Player 1 plays A0).
   - If Player 1 delegates and you do not: You can get 2 points (if you play A0) or 20 points (if you play A1).
  
- **2 delegates**: Plays A0.
   - If both delegate: Both get 10 points.

### Preference Towards Mediators:
- **Mediator proposed by Player 1**: There's unpredictability if only 1 player delegates because the result is asymmetrical and depends heavily on the opponent's choice.
- **Mediator proposed by Player 2**: Offers more predictability and consistency, both if one or both delegate, hence securing safer earnings.

### Conclusion:
Based on the assessment, approving the mediator proposed by Player 2 seems the most advantageous as it provides consistent and predictable actions and ensures at least 10 points if both delegate.

### Final JSON Output:
```json
{
  "M1": false,
  "M2": true
}
```
This reflects that I prefer the mediator proposed by Player 2 for its predictability and the expected higher payoff consistency.

response:
To approach this decision-making game effectively, we need to break down and analyze it step by step to ensure we maximize our total points. Here are the steps involved in our analysis:

### Step 1: Understanding Payoffs
First, we need to comprehend the payoff matrix clearly:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0    | A1    |
|--------------------|-------|-------|
| **A0**             | 10,10 | 0,20  |
| **A1**             | 6,2   | 4,4   |

### Step 2: Independent Strategy Analysis
If both players decide to act independently, we should consider the payoffs:
- If both play A0, they each get 10 points.
- If I play A0 and the other player plays A1, I get 0 points and the other player gets 20 points.
- If I play A1 and the other player plays A0, I get 6 points and they get 2 points.
- If both play A1, they each get 4 points.

### Step 3: Mediator Analysis
Now let's evaluate the mediators. Both mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 have the same strategies:

1. If only one player delegates to the mediator, the mediator will play A1.
2. If both players delegate to the mediator, the mediator will play A0.

#### Mediator Advantages and Disadvantages
1. **One Player Delegates:**
   - If I delegate and the other does not, the mediator plays A1 for me.
   - Payoffs: (A1, other’s action)
   - If the other chooses A0: I get 6 points, they get 2 points.
   - If the other chooses A1: I get 4 points, they get 4 points.

2. **Both Players Delegate:**
   - The mediator plays A0 for both players.
   - Payoffs: (A0, A0)
   - Both players get 10 points.

### Step 4: Decision Making
Given that both mediators will play A0 if both players delegate, which results in the mutual maximum return (10 points each), and the worse expected payoff for uncoordinated actions with mediators (mediator A1 results in either 6/2 or 4/4), it is advantageous to approve mediators that ensure cooperation and maximize points.

Additionally, since both proposed mediators have the same mechanism and there’s no disadvantage unique to one mediator, we should approve both.

### Step 5: Approval Voting
Given our analysis, our approval decision should be:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

Both mediators deserve approval as they enable coordination that maximizes our expected payoff. Here’s the concise JSON output:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

To decide which mediators to approve, we need to evaluate how each mediator will affect our expected points, depending on whether we delegate our move to the mediator.

Let's break down the processes:

### Steps to Evaluate Mediators:
1. **Payoffs Analysis:**
   - If both players choose action probabilities independently, the expected points would depend on the equilibrium strategy. 
   - Calculate what happens if we delegate to each mediator proposed.

2. **Mediator Proposed by Player 1:**
   - **If 1 player delegates** (you or Player 2): The mediator will play A1.
     - If you delegate to the mediator: You will play A1; Player 2 will choose independently:
       - Player 2 plays A0: You get 6 points (since the mediator plays A1).
       - Player 2 plays A1: You get 4 points (since the mediator plays A1).
     - If Player 2 delegates to the mediator: Player 2 will play A1; You will choose independently:
       - If you play A0: You get 0 points (since the mediator plays A1).
       - If you play A1: You get 4 points (since the mediator plays A1).
   - **If both players delegate**: The mediator will play A0.
     - You get 10 points (since both mediators play A0).

3. **Mediator Proposed by Player 2:**
   - **If 1 player delegates**:
     - If you delegate to the mediator: You will play A0; Player 2 will choose independently:
       - Player 2 plays A0: You get 10 points.
       - Player 2 plays A1: You get 0 points.
     - If Player 2 delegates to the mediator: Player 2 will play A0; You will choose independently:
       - If you play A0: You get 10 points.
       - If you play A1: You get 6 points.
   - **If both players delegate**: The mediator will play A0.
     - You get 10 points (since both mediators play A0).

### Analyze Decision Impact:
- **Mediator proposed by Player 1**:
  - When both delegate: You get 10 points.
  - When only you delegate: Depending on Player 2's independent choice, you get 6 or 4 points.
  - When only Player 2 delegates: Depending on your independent choice, you get 0 or 4 points.
- **Mediator proposed by Player 2**:
  - When both delegate: You get 10 points.
  - When only you delegate: Depending on Player 2's independent choice, you get 10 or 0 points.
  - When only Player 2 delegates: Depending on your independent choice, you get 10 or 6 points.

### Recommended Approach:
We need to maximize our points while considering the likely independent action of the other player. Both mediators offer the same outcome (10 points each) if both delegate, but the probable outcomes differ when only one player delegates.

Given that the mediator proposed by Player 2 consistently seems to provide better or equal outcomes compared to the mediator proposed by Player 1, I approve the mediator proposed by Player 2. The mediator proposed by Player 1 offers a less advantageous position when there isn't full cooperation or complete delegation.

### Final Decision:

{
    "M1": false,
    "M2": true
}

response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the best possible mixed strategy to maximize our points, considering the decision-making dynamics involving both players and the mediator.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Understanding Payoffs
Let's analyze the payoffs for each scenario:

- If both players choose A0: Both get 10 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other gets 0.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other gets 6.
- If both choose A1: Both get 4 points.

### Step 2: Mediator Actions
If the mediator is selected, it will always choose A0 regardless of how many players delegate to it.

### Step 3: Action Evaluation:
Consider the payoffs involving mediator:
- If both delegate to the mediator: Both get 10 points.
- If you delegate to the mediator and the other chooses A0: Both get 10 points.
- If you delegate to the mediator and the other chooses A1: You get 2 points, and they get 6 points.

Delegating to the mediator ensures a guaranteed outcome, but it's important to examine the risk and reward compared to independent actions.

### Step 4: Best Response Analysis:
Playing independently:
- Choosing A0 without mediator: 
  - If the other chooses A0: 10 points.
  - If the other chooses A1: 2 points.
- Choosing A1:
  - If the other chooses A0: 20 points.
  - If the other chooses A1: 4 points.

### Step 5: Mixed Strategy Optimization
We now need to assign probability values to each action such that we maximize our expected points. Given the risk of the other player not coordinating to delegate to the mediator, balancing the probabilities for A0, A1, and A2 is critical.

### Step 6: Payoff Maximization through Probabilities
To achieve optimality:
- Delegating to mediator ensures at least 10 points if the other player also does.
- Independent choices with probabilities can hedge against the risk of non-coordination.

Considering this, a probable distribution could be:
- We delegate to the mediator (A2) with a significant probability as a safe bet.
- Balance A0 and A1 to mitigate the risk.

### Final Decision
An intuitive mixed strategy:
- Higher probability to delegate to mediator since it guarantees safe returns if coordinated.
- Lesser but notable probabilities for independent choices to account for the other player’s possible deviation.

Final probability distribution:

response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we need to consider both the payoff structure and the existence of the mediator. Let's first analyze the direct payoffs and understand the potential outcomes:

1. If both players choose A0:
   - Each player gets 10 points.

2. If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
   - You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.

3. If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
   - You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.

4. If both players choose A1:
   - Each player gets 4 points.

Next, let's consider the influence of the mediator. The mediator guarantees to play A0 if delegated to by any player:
- If you delegate (A2) to the mediator, and the other player does not:
  - The mediator plays A0 for you, thus your payoffs would depend on the other player's action.
  
- If both players delegate (A2):
  - The mediator plays A0 for both, resulting in both players getting 10 points.

Given this, delegation appears to offer a guaranteed safer route to a reasonable payoff if the other player is unreliable. If there is mutual trust that both players will delegate, you both secure a solid result (10 points).

However, if you delegate independently while the other player opts differently, your points depend entirely on their action, which introduces risk. Here's how we might navigate this:

1. Consider the Nash Equilibrium:
   - Delegation (A2) by both players provides stability with a 10-point guarantee.
   - Non-delegation actions A0 and A1 don't offer better guaranteed outcomes since mixed actions complicate optimal expectations.

2. Utilize a mixed strategy to balance between delegating to the mediator and playing independently:
   - Allocating a portion of choices to A2 (delegation) and balancing between A0 and A1 might be a practical approach.
   
3. Distribute probabilities to reflect these choices:

To maximize points against potential strategies, let's delegate some proportionally higher probability to A2 and distribute the rest carefully.

Thus, our mixed strategy JSON configuration could be:

```json
{"A0": 30, "A1": 20, "A2": 50}
```

This translates to:
- 50% likelihood of delegating to the mediator (ensuring 10 points if the other also opts A2).
- 30% playing A0 for scenarios where the other player might also prefer independent same action for the higher payoff match.
- 20% for A1 considering the mixed strategy potential where striking a balance on isolated beneficial outcomes comes into play. 

This configuration aims to maximize the possible average points in a strategic and collaborative context.

Let's break down the decision-making process step by step to understand the best possible strategy to maximize your total points in this game.

### Step 1: Understanding Payoffs
First, let's analyze the payoffs without considering the mediator:

- If you and the other player both choose A0:
  - You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
  
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
  
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
  
- If you both choose A1:
  - You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.

### Step 2: Considering the Mediator
Next let's analyze the mediator’s actions:

- If only 1 player delegates to the mediator, it plays A1 for that player.
  - The player who delegated gets 4 or 6 points depending on the opponent's choice.
  
- If both players delegate to the mediator, it plays A0 for both.
  - Both players end up with 10 points.

### Step 3: Mixed Strategy Analysis
Given the payoffs and mediator actions, let’s think about how to distribute probabilities among the actions.

- **A0** has a safe high reward if the other player also chooses A0 (10 points), but a high risk if the other player chooses A1 (0 points).
  
- **A1** guarantees points regardless of the other player’s action, with a lower but steady payoff.
  
- **A2** (Delegating to mediator) opens up a coordinated move if both players delegate, yielding a high reward of 10 points. If only you delegate, the payoff outcomes are similar to choosing A1 directly, with minor variations depending on the opponent’s choice.

### Plan of Action
- To maximize points, cooperation via mediator (both players choosing A2) seems beneficial. Yet, assuming the opponent may not cooperate or may hedge against different strategies, a mixed strategy seems reasonable.
  
- You may assign a decent probability to delegating to the mediator, ensuring a chance at a higher payoff through cooperation while hedging against non-cooperation by balancing between A0 and A1.

### Step 4: Constructing Mixed Strategy
To ensure a valid and balanced strategy:
- Assign probabilities to ensure a mix between A0, A1, and A2.
- Consider an approximate split, balancing between directly playing actions and the mediator option.

Final strategy in percentages could be (approximates to keep balanced):
- A0: 20%
- A1: 30%
- A2: 50%

### JSON Object Output

```json
{"A0": 20, "A1": 30, "A2": 50}
```

This strategy balances between direct actions and the mediator, leveraging potential cooperation while hedging with probabilistic direct action.

Let's break down the problem to find out the best course of action. To maximize your total points in the game, you need to evaluate each mediator and approve the ones that are most beneficial for you.

### Evaluating the Mediators

### 1. Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **If 1 player delegates:** Plays action A1.
- **If 2 players delegate:** Plays action A0.

### 2. Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- **If 1 player delegates:** Plays action A0.
- **If 2 players delegate:** Plays action A0.

### Calculating the Expected Payoff for Each Scenario

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **If 1 player delegates (you):** The mediator will play action A1.
  - If the other player does not delegate and plays A0, you get 20 points (20, 0).
  - If the other player does not delegate and plays A1, you get 4 points (4, 4).
  - If the other player also delegates, the mediator will play A0 for both: you get 10 points (10, 10).
  
- **If 2 players delegate:** Both actions will be A0, leading to (10, 10) points.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- **If 1 player delegates (you):** The mediator will play action A0.
  - If the other player does not delegate and plays A0, you get 10 points (10, 10).
  - If the other player does not delegate and plays A1, you get 2 points (2, 6).
  - If the other player also delegates, the mediator will play A0 for both: you get 10 points (10, 10).

- **If 2 players delegate:** Both actions will be A0, leading to (10, 10) points.

### Conclusion:
- **Mediator proposed by Player 1**:
  - If you delegate alone, you could get 20 or 4 points based on what the other player does.
  - If both delegate, you get a guaranteed 10 points.

- **Mediator proposed by Player 2**:
  - If you delegate alone, you could get 10 or 2 points.

Given this, the mediator proposed by Player 1 offers a higher potential payoff (20 points) when you delegate alone, compared to the one proposed by Player 2, which offers a maximum of 10 points if you delegate alone.

### Decision:
- Approve Mediator proposed by Player 1 (has higher potential payoff).
- Do not approve Mediator proposed by Player 2 (lower max payoff when delegating alone).

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "M1": true,
    "M2": false
}
```

### Final Answer
```json
{
    "M1": true,
    "M2": false
}
```

In summary, approving Mediator proposed by Player 1 can potentially result in a higher individual payoff, thus maximizing your chances of scoring more points in the game.

As Player 2, action **A1 strictly dominates A0** in the underlying game: no matter what Player 1 does, you get more points with A1 than with A0.

Now consider delegating (**A2**):
- If **only you** delegate, the mediator plays **A1** for you → you get exactly what you’d choose anyway (no downside).
- If **both players** delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both → you get **10** instead of the **4** you’d get if both independently played A1.

So delegating is **never worse** than playing A1 yourself, and is sometimes strictly better (when Player 1 also delegates). Therefore, put all probability on delegating.

To approach this decision-making problem, it is essential to carefully analyze the provided payoffs and how the mediator's actions will influence your total points. Let's evaluate each possibility step by step and consider the optimal strategy.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix**:
   - **(You: A0, Other: A0)**: You get 10 points, Other gets 10 points.
   - **(You: A0, Other: A1)**: You get 0 points, Other gets 20 points.
   - **(You: A1, Other: A0)**: You get 6 points, Other gets 2 points.
   - **(You: A1, Other: A1)**: You get 4 points, Other gets 4 points.

2. **Considering the Mediator**:
   - If you delegate (A2) to the mediator:
     - If 1 player (you alone) delegates, the mediator will play A1 for you.
     - If 2 players (both you and the other player) delegate, the mediator will play A0 for both.

3. **Analyzing Outcomes**:
   - If you both delegate to mediator:
     - **(Mediator plays A0)**: You both get 10 points.
   - If only you delegate to mediator:
     - If the other player plays A0: You get 6 points, Other gets 2 points.
     - If the other player plays A1: You get 4 points, Other gets 4 points.

4. **Possible Strategies**:
   - **Strategy S1**: Explicitly choose A0.
   - **Strategy S2**: Explicitly choose A1.
   - **Strategy S3**: Delegate to mediator (A2).

### Deriving the Optimal Mixed Strategy:
The objective is to maximize your total points, and this also depends on the other player's likely actions, including their potential delegation to the mediator.

- If the likelihood of the other player also delegating is high, there is a strong preference for both players to delegate as it assures each player a guaranteed 10 points.
- If the other player might not delegate, delegating yourself (own action A2) and hoping the other player independently plays a non-delegated action could be risky but it introduces uncertainty.

To avoid predictable outcomes that could favor the other player excessively or be suboptimal, it's advantageous to employ a mixed strategy that utilizes probabilistic decision-making to increase risk symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of predicting the other player's choice, a balanced mixed strategy is preferable.

Here is a viable probability distribution:
- Moderate probability for A0 (it gives high points if both cooperate).
- Lower probability for A1 (a safe, yet moderately optimal fallback).
- Leaving a significant probability for delegation (ensuring a likely favorable median).

### Final Mixed Strategy JSON:
```json
{"A0": 40, "A1": 20, "A2": 40}
```

This distribution leverages the probabilistic benefit with strong points towards guaranteed mediation outcomes while keeping chances to independently pursue A0 or A1 actions if beneficial uncertainties prevail.

To determine the best strategy for maximizing my total points, I'll carefully analyze the given situation step by step.

### Understanding the Game Dynamics
1. **Actions and Payoffs:**
   - If both players choose A0: Each gets 10 points.
   - If I choose A0 and the other chooses A1: I get 0 points, the other gets 20 points.
   - If I choose A1 and the other chooses A0: I get 6 points, the other gets 2 points.
   - If both choose A1: Each gets 4 points.

2. **Mediator Behavior:**
   - If I delegate (A2) and no one else does, mediator plays A1.
   - If both players delegate, mediator plays A0.

### Strategy Considerations
The strategy involves choosing a probability distribution over three actions: A0, A1, A2. To analyze the potential outcomes:
- Delegating to the mediator can result in it playing A0 (if both players delegate) or A1 (if only one delegates).
- If both delegate and the mediator plays A0, we both receive 10 points.
- If only one delegates and it plays A1, the payoff depends on the action of the non-delegating player:
  - If I delegate and they choose A0: I get 6 points (mediator plays A1 and they choose A0).
  - If I delegate and they choose A1: I get 4 points (mediator plays A1 and they choose A1).

### Probabilities and Mixed Strategies
To determine a balanced approach that leverages the mediator's potential advantages and avoids the pitfalls of the non-symmetric payoffs, we blend:
1. **Direct Actions (A0, A1) based on payoff dominance**:
   - A0 is beneficial if anticipating mutual A0.
   - A1 is safer if anticipating opposition A0 for more guaranteed points.
   
2. **Mediator Delegation (A2)** considering it resolves based on the number of delegates.

Balancing these decisions probabilistically can be structured as:
- A non-zero probability for direct and mediator-action to guard against a too deterministic approach.
- Giving the mediator a chance avoids predictable direct plays.

### Reasoning Probabilities
- **Direct Actions Paraphrase**:
  - Slight tilt towards mediator can trick opposition.
  - Assure non-delegate even like 10% for direct while contrasting mediator as quasi-randomizing factor.

Thus, combining factors logically:

```json
{
  "A0": 30,
  "A1": 20,
  "A2": 50
}
```

Here, the probabilities attempt to maintain equilibrium across direct interactions while leveraging the unpredictability introduced via the mediator. This blends safety and challenge approaches.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Understanding the Game (as Player 2)

Let me first construct the payoff matrix from my perspective:

**My Payoffs (Player 2):**
```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0         10              2
Player 2: A1         20              4
```

**Player 1's Payoffs:**
```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0         10              6
Player 2: A1          0              4
```

## Finding the Base Game Equilibrium

- For me (Player 2): A1 dominates A0 (20 > 10 when P1 plays A0; 4 > 2 when P1 plays A1)
- For Player 1: Best response to my A0 is A0 (10 > 6); best response to my A1 is A1 (4 > 0)

The **Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1) with payoffs **(4, 4)**.

However, (A0, A0) gives **(10, 10)** - much better for both! This is a classic coordination/prisoner's dilemma problem.

## Analyzing the Mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

## Evaluating Different Delegation Scenarios

1. **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → payoffs **(10, 10)** ✓
2. **Only Player 1 delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for P1; I optimally play A1 → payoffs **(4, 4)**
3. **Only I delegate**: Mediator plays A1 for me; P1 optimally plays A1 → payoffs **(4, 4)**
4. **Neither delegates**: Standard Nash equilibrium → payoffs **(4, 4)**

## Strategic Analysis

If Player 1 delegates:
- I should delegate: 10 vs 4 → **delegate is better**

If Player 1 doesn't delegate:
- I'm indifferent: both give 4

This creates **two Nash equilibria** in the delegation game:
1. **(Both delegate, Both delegate)** → **(10, 10)** - Pareto optimal!
2. **(Neither delegates, Neither delegates)** → **(4, 4)**

## Conclusion

The mediators enable coordination on the superior outcome (10, 10) without any downside risk - the worst case equals the status quo. Since both mediators are identical and beneficial, I should approve both.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game without a mediator

From my perspective (Player 1), the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

The Nash equilibrium of this game is (A1, A1), where both players get 4 points. This is a classic prisoner's dilemma - we'd both prefer (A0, A0) for 10 points each, but individually we're incentivized to defect.

## Step 2: Compare the proposed mediators

**M1 (proposed by Player 1):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**M2 (proposed by Player 2):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1  
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

These mediators are **identical** in their behavior.

## Step 3: Analyze outcomes with the mediator

Let me work backward from the delegation decision:

**If both players delegate:**
- Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get **10 points**

**If only I delegate:**
- Mediator plays A1 for me, other player chooses optimally
- Against my A1, other player prefers A1 (4 points) over A0 (2 points)
- Outcome: (A1, A1) → I get **4 points**

**If only other player delegates:**
- Other player gets A1 from mediator, I choose optimally
- Against their A1, I prefer A1 (4 points) over A0 (0 points)
- Outcome: (A1, A1) → I get **4 points**

**If neither delegates:**
- Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → I get **4 points**

## Step 4: Determine delegation equilibrium

The delegation game payoffs are:
```
                Other delegates    Other doesn't
I delegate:          10                4
I don't:             4                 4
```

**Delegating weakly dominates not delegating** (10 ≥ 4 and 4 = 4). The same is true for the other player.

The unique equilibrium is for **both players to delegate**, achieving the cooperative outcome of 10 points each instead of 4.

## Step 5: Decision

Both M1 and M2 are identical and both enable us to escape the prisoner's dilemma and achieve the cooperative outcome. This increases my expected payoff from 4 to 10 points.

I should approve both mediators.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game without a mediator

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

The Nash equilibrium without mediation is (A1, A1), giving both players 4 points. Note that (A0, A0) would give both players 10 points, but it's unstable because each player has an incentive to deviate to maximize their own payoff.

## Step 2: Analyze both proposed mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

## Step 3: Evaluate outcomes with the mediator

**If both players delegate:** 
- Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → Both get 10 points

**If only I delegate:**
- I get A1, Player 2 chooses optimally
- Player 2's best response to A1 is A1 (gets 4 vs 2)
- Outcome: (A1, A1) → Both get 4 points

**If only Player 2 delegates:**
- Player 2 gets A1, I choose optimally  
- My best response to A1 is A1 (gets 4 vs 0)
- Outcome: (A1, A1) → Both get 4 points

**If neither delegates:**
- Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → Both get 4 points

## Step 4: Find equilibrium with mediator

The delegation game becomes:
- (Delegate, Delegate): (10, 10) ✓ This is a Nash equilibrium!
- (Delegate, Not): (4, 4) - Player 2 would deviate to Delegate
- (Not, Delegate): (4, 4) - I would deviate to Delegate  
- (Not, Not): (4, 4) - Either player would deviate to Delegate

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- **Without mediator:** Nash equilibrium gives me 4 points
- **With mediator:** Nash equilibrium gives me 10 points

The mediator enables coordination on the mutually beneficial outcome (A0, A0), improving my payoff from 4 to 10 points with no downside risk.

## Conclusion

Both mediators are identical and beneficial. I should approve both.

Let's break down the decision-making process step by step for this specific game scenario.

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix

Here's the matrix again for reference:
- You choose A0, Other chooses A0: (10, 10)
- You choose A0, Other chooses A1: (0, 20)
- You choose A1, Other chooses A0: (6, 2)
- You choose A1, Other chooses A1: (4, 4)

### Step 2: Analyzing the Mediator's Actions

Based on the mediator's rules:
- If 1 player delegates, the mediator will choose A1.
- If 2 players delegate, the mediator will choose A0.

This information could play a crucial role in our strategy.

### Step 3: Deciding When to Delegate

We need to consider under which circumstances delegating to the mediator makes us better off:
- If the other player delegates and we do not, they will play A0 and we play independent.
- If neither player delegates, we play independently.
- If both players delegate, both will play A0.

### Step 4: Formulating a Mixed Strategy

Our objective is to maximize our expected payoff. A mixed strategy will allow us to incorporate multiple possibilities. We should incorporate a balanced approach, accounting for pure strategies (A0, A1) and the delegation option (A2).

Here's how we reason:
- If we both play A0: 10 points.
- If we both play A1: 4 points.
- Mixing A0 and A1 independently could lead to less predictable payoffs, which needs careful balancing.
- Delegating to the mediator allows for a cooperative approach with predictable outcomes (A0 if both delegate).

### Step 5: Choosing the Probabilities

Given that the mediator provides a strategic advantage if both delegate, we should balance our actions to encourage coordination without overly relying on any single action. 

We need to choose probabilities such that:
- We have a competitive independent strategy.
- We take advantage of the mediator’s cooperative strategy if the other player is willing to coordinate.

Considering a balanced strategy:
- Moderate probability on A2 (to benefit from mediator if opponent delegates).
- Slightly higher probability on A0, since if both play A0 or when the mediator forces A0, it’s beneficial.

Let's configure the final probabilities:
```json
{"A0": 40, "A1": 30, "A2": 30}
```

This setup gives a reasonable chance to delegate while maintaining competitiveness with A0 and A1. This will allow us to benefit from both independent actions when necessary and cooperative play via delegation.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game from my perspective (Player 2)

My payoff matrix:
- If other plays A0: I get 10 from A0, or 20 from A1 → **A1 is better**
- If other plays A1: I get 2 from A0, or 4 from A1 → **A1 is better**

**A1 is my dominant strategy** - I always prefer it regardless of what the other player does.

## Step 2: Find the Nash equilibrium without mediator

Since I have a dominant strategy (A1), I will always play A1.

Given I play A1, the other player's payoffs are:
- A0 gives them 0 points
- A1 gives them 4 points

So they'll play A1 too.

**Base game outcome: (A1, A1) = 4 points for me, 4 points for them**

## Step 3: Analyze what happens with the mediator

Both proposed mediators are identical:
- 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

Let me check all delegation scenarios:

**If both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)** ✓

**If only one delegates:** That player gets A1 (via mediator), the other player knows this and best responds with A1 → **(4, 4)**

**If neither delegates:** Back to Nash equilibrium → **(4, 4)**

## Step 4: Strategic analysis

The delegation game becomes:
```
                Other delegates    Other doesn't
I delegate:           10                4
I don't:              4                 4
```

**Delegating weakly dominates not delegating** (10 ≥ 4 in all cases), and both players have the same incentive structure.

## Step 5: Conclusion

Both mediators are:
1. **Identical** in their design
2. **Beneficial** - they enable coordination to (10, 10) instead of being stuck at (4, 4)
3. **Risk-free** - worst case with mediator is still (4, 4), same as without it

The mediators act as a commitment device that allows us to escape the inefficient Nash equilibrium and achieve the cooperative outcome.

response:
To maximize points as Player 2, let’s analyze the payoffs for all possible action combinations, including the delegation option (A2).

### 1. Game Matrix Analysis
The original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Now, we introduce **A2 (Delegate)**:
- If 1 player delegates, the mediator plays **A1**.
- If 2 players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both.

Expanded Matrix:
- **P1=A0, P2=A2**: One delegate (P2). Mediator plays A1 for P2. Result (A0, A1) → **(0, 20)**.
- **P1=A1, P2=A2**: One delegate (P2). Mediator plays A1 for P2. Result (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**.
- **P1=A2, P2=A0**: One delegate (P1). Mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A0) → **(6, 2)**.
- **P1=A2, P2=A1**: One delegate (P1). Mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**.
- **P1=A2, P2=A2**: Two delegates. Mediator plays A0 for both. Result (A0, A0) → **(10, 10)**.

### 2. Player 2's Strategy Evaluation
Let's see Player 2's payoffs for each choice:
- If P1 plays A0: A0=10, A1=20, **A2=20**
- If P1 plays A1: A0=2, A1=4, **A2=4**
- If P1 plays A2: A0=2, A1=4, **A2=10**

For Player 2, **A2 weakly dominates A1** (it is never worse than A1 and is better if P1 plays A2) and **strictly dominates A0**.

### 3. Player 1's Strategy Evaluation
- If P2 plays A0: A0=10, A1=6, A2=6
- If P2 plays A1: A0=0, A1=4, A2=4
- If P2 plays A2: A0=0, A1=4, **A2=10**

If Player 1 anticipates that Player 2 will act rationally and choose A2, Player 1’s best response is to also choose A2 (10 > 4 > 0).

### 4. Conclusion
The delegation option creates a stable Nash Equilibrium at (A2, A2) that yields 10 points for each player. This is superior to the basic game's equilibrium of (A1, A1) which yields only 4 points. Since A2 is a weakly dominant strategy for Player 2 and leads to the highest mutually beneficial outcome when both players are rational, the optimal strategy is to delegate.

response:
To maximize my total points, I first analyze the basic game and then the effects of each mediator.

**1. Basic Game Analysis:**
The payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 10, 10
- (A0, A1): 2, 6 (Player 2: 2, Player 1: 6)
- (A1, A0): 20, 0 (Player 2: 20, Player 1: 0)
- (A1, A1): 4, 4
Player 2 (me) has a dominant strategy (A1), which earns more points regardless of Player 1's action (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1 will choose A1 to maximize their own points (4 > 0). Thus, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

**2. Mediator Analysis:**
Both mediators offer a way to move toward the (A0, A0) outcome, which yields 10 points for both players.

- **Mediator 1 (M1):** 1 delegate = A1, 2 delegates = A0.
  - If both players delegate, the outcome is (A0, A0), giving me 10 points.
  - If only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1 for them, typically leading to the (A1, A1) outcome (4 points).
  - This is a standard coordination mechanism but requires both players to trust each other to delegate.

- **Mediator 2 (M2):** 1 delegate = A0, 2 delegates = A0.
  - If I (Player 2) delegate to M2, the mediator plays A0 for me. Player 1's best response to A0 is A0 (as 10 > 6). This results in (A0, A0) and 10 points for me, regardless of whether Player 1 delegates.
  - If Player 1 delegates to M2, the mediator plays A0 for them. My best response is A1 (as 20 > 10). This results in (A0, A1) and 20 points for me.
  - If both delegate, it results in (A0, A0) and 10 points.

**3. Decision:**
M2 is superior for Player 2 for two reasons:
1. It is more robust: I can guarantee a payoff of 10 by delegating independently (assuming Player 1 is rational), whereas M1 requires mutual delegation.
2. It has higher upside: If Player 1 delegates, I could potentially receive 20 points.

According to the selection rules, the winning mediator is selected from those with the maximum number of approvals. If I approve only M2 and Player 1 approves only M1, both will have one approval and one will be chosen at random (50/50 chance). If I approve both M1 and M2, and Player 1 only approves M1, then M1 will be chosen (100% chance). Since M2 is better for me than M1, and both are better than the baseline of 4, I will maximize my expected utility by approving only M2.

Let me work through this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the base game without a mediator

First, let me analyze what happens in the original game:

**My payoffs (Player 1):**
- If other plays A0: I get 10 from A0, or 6 from A1 → A0 is better
- If other plays A1: I get 0 from A0, or 4 from A1 → A1 is better

**Player 2's payoffs:**
- If I play A0: They get 10 from A0, or 20 from A1 → A1 is better  
- If I play A1: They get 2 from A0, or 4 from A1 → A1 is better

**Player 2 has a dominant strategy: A1**

Given this, I should also play A1, resulting in Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) with payoff **(4, 4)**.

## Step 2: Compare the mediator proposals

**Mediator M1:** 1 player delegates → A1; 2 players delegate → A0

**Mediator M2:** 1 player delegates → A1; 2 players delegate → A0

**Both mediators are identical!**

## Step 3: Analyze outcomes with the mediator

With either mediator, possible scenarios:

1. **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)** ✓
2. **Only I delegate**: Mediator plays A1 for me, Player 2 optimally plays A1 → **(4, 4)**
3. **Only Player 2 delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for them, I optimally play A1 → **(4, 4)**
4. **Neither delegates**: Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**

## Step 4: Verify "both delegate" is a Nash equilibrium

If Player 2 delegates:
- I delegate: Get 10
- I don't delegate: Get 4 (both end up playing A1)
- **I prefer to delegate** (10 > 4)

By symmetry, if I delegate, Player 2 also prefers to delegate.

Therefore, **"both delegate" is a Nash equilibrium** that yields (10, 10) instead of (4, 4)!

## Step 5: Decision

Both mediators:
- Are functionally identical
- Enable coordination on the mutually beneficial outcome (10, 10)
- Strictly improve over the non-mediated Nash equilibrium (4, 4)

Since both mediators offer the same benefit and there's no difference between them, I should approve both.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10, opponent gets 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 20  
- (A1, A0): I get 6, opponent gets 2
- (A1, A1): I get 4, opponent gets 4

Without a mediator, A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2 (they always prefer A1). Given this, I should play A1, leading to the Nash equilibrium of (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4).

The cooperative outcome (A0, A0) giving (10, 10) is better but hard to achieve.

## Step 2: Analyze Mediator 1 (my proposal)

Delegation game outcomes:
- Both delegate (2 players): Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) = (10, 10) ✓
- Only I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me, opponent best responds with A1 → (4, 4)
- Only opponent delegates: Mediator plays A1 for them, I best respond with A1 → (4, 4)
- Neither delegates: Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

This creates a coordination game where both players want to delegate together. The worst outcome for me is 4 points.

## Step 3: Analyze Mediator 2 (opponent's proposal)

Delegation game outcomes:
- Both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both → (10, 10) ✓
- Only I delegate: Mediator plays A0 for me, opponent best responds with A1 → (0, 20) ✗✗
- Only opponent delegates: Mediator plays A0 for them, I best respond with A0 → (10, 10)
- Neither delegates: Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

This creates an anti-coordination dynamic. **Critical risk**: If I delegate alone, I get 0 points (worst possible outcome).

## Step 4: Compare mediators

**Mediator 1:**
- Clear coordination focal point (both should delegate)
- Worst case: 4 points
- Best case: 10 points
- Safer and more stable

**Mediator 2:**
- Anti-coordination dynamics
- Worst case: 0 points (if I delegate alone)
- Best case: 10 points  
- Risky for me

## Step 5: Voting strategy

Since I strongly prefer Mediator 1 (safer, better coordination properties, no risk of 0 points), I should:
- Approve M1: ensures my preferred mediator has at least my vote
- Not approve M2: avoids increasing M2's approval count, maximizing M1's chances

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the baseline game

Without any mediator, let me find the Nash equilibrium:
- From Player 2's perspective: A1 dominates A0 (they get 20 vs 10 if I play A0, and 4 vs 2 if I play A1)
- Given Player 2 plays A1, my best response is A1 (I get 4 vs 0)
- **Baseline Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → payoff (4, 4)**

## Step 2: Analyze Mediator 1 (M1)

Possible outcomes:
- **Both delegate**: M1 plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)** ✓
- **Only I delegate**: M1 plays A1 for me, other player's best response is A1 → (4, 4)
- **Only P2 delegates**: M1 plays A1 for P2, my best response is A1 → (4, 4)
- **Neither delegates**: Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

Nash equilibria:
1. Both delegate → (10, 10) [Pareto optimal, focal point]
2. Neither delegates → (4, 4)

## Step 3: Analyze Mediator 2 (M2)

Possible outcomes:
- **Both delegate**: M2 plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)** ✓
- **Only I delegate**: M2 plays A0 for me, P2's best response is A1 → (0, 20) [Bad for me!]
- **Only P2 delegates**: M2 plays A0 for P2, my best response is A0 → **(10, 10)** ✓
- **Neither delegates**: Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

Nash equilibria:
1. Both delegate → (10, 10)
2. I don't delegate, P2 delegates → (10, 10)
3. Neither delegates → (4, 4)

## Step 4: Compare mediators

Both mediators:
- Achieve the cooperative outcome (10, 10) in their best equilibria
- Massively improve over the baseline (4, 4)

**M1 advantage**: Symmetric incentives - both players need to coordinate to delegate together.

**M2 advantage**: Has an asymmetric equilibrium where P2 delegates and I don't, still achieving (10, 10). This reduces coordination risk for me since if P2 delegates (which they're incentivized to do), I get 10 regardless of whether I delegate.

## Step 5: Decision

Both mediators significantly improve outcomes and achieve (10, 10) in equilibrium. M2 offers slightly better coordination safety for me. Since both are acceptable and far superior to no mediator, I should approve both.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)

We are Player 2 in a two-player simultaneous-move game. Each player chooses an action (A0 or A1) with some probability.

The payoff matrix (from **Player 2's perspective**) is:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0        | A1        |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**                        | 10        | 2         |
| **A1**                        | 20        | 4         |

Note: This is Player 2’s payoff. Player 1’s payoffs are just the symmetric entries.

Let’s analyze this game as a standard 2x2 game.

#### Best Response Analysis:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - Player 2's best response: A1 (20 > 10)

- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - Player 2's best response: A0 (2 > 4? Wait: 2 vs 4 → 4 is better!)  
    → A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 → so **A1 is better**

Wait: Let's clarify.

From Player 2's point of view:
- If Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Player 2: A0 → 10, A1 → 20 → so **A1 is better**
- If Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Player 2: A0 → 2, A1 → 4 → so **A1 is better**

So **A1 dominates A0 for Player 2**.

Wait — is that correct?

Yes:  
- Whatever Player 1 does, A1 gives Player 2 **at least as much as A0**, and strictly more in one case.

- If Player 1 chooses A0 → A1 gives 20 > 10
- If Player 1 chooses A1 → A1 gives 4 > 2

So **A1 is strictly dominant for Player 2**.

But wait — let's double-check the payoffs:

- (A0, A0): you get 10 → Player 2
- (A1, A0): you get 20 → Player 2
- (A0, A1): you get 2 → Player 2
- (A1, A1): you get 4 → Player 2

Yes: A1 always yields higher payoff for Player 2, **no matter what the other player does**.

So **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2**.

Thus, **in the base game, Player 2 should always choose A1**.

But now comes the **twist**: delegation to a mediator.

---

### Step 2: Understanding the Delegation Mechanism

- You can **delegate** your move to a mediator.
- The other player can also delegate or not.
- The **mediators are selected via approval voting**.
- The **winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.

So your goal is to **approve mediators** such that, in the final game (after selection), you maximize your **expected payoff**, possibly taking into account:
- Whether you delegate or not
- Whether the other player delegates or not
- Which mediator gets chosen

But remember: you are a **rational player** trying to maximize your own points.

Now, the two proposed mediators:

---

#### Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):

- If **1 player** delegates to it → it plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate to it → it plays A0

> (Note: The proposal says "Player 1" proposed M1, and "Player 2" proposed M2 — but both mediators are identical.)

Wait – both mediators have **the same rules**:
- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

So M1 and M2 are **identical in behavior**.

This suggests they are **the same mediator**, just proposed by different players.

So there is **no behavioral difference** between M1 and M2.

Therefore, **approval of one or both should have the same impact on your expected payoff.**

But let’s proceed carefully.

---

### Step 3: Your Decision – Approve M1? M2?

We must decide for each mediator: approve (`true`) or not (`false`).

You want to maximize your **expected payoff** in the final game, under the assumption that:

- Both you and the other player will choose whether to delegate or not, **after** the mediator is selected.
- But since the mediator selection depends on **approvals**, and you only control your approvals, you must predict or optimize for what outcome will result.

Wait — **critical point**: the **delegation decision happens after the mediator is selected**.

So the full timeline is:

1. **Approval voting**: you and the other player approve (or not) M1 and M2. The one(s) with highest approvals are potential winners. Winner is chosen uniformly at random from the top.
2. Then, you and the other player simultaneously decide **whether to delegate to the chosen mediator or play yourself**.

So the key is: you don't know which mediator will be used when you decide whether to delegate — but you can anticipate that you’ll later decide based on the **mediator’s behavior**.

But since both M1 and M2 behave identically, their **strategic impact is the same**.

So if you approve both, you increase the chance that a mediator is selected (since larger approval pool), but you still don’t gain anything by approving both — since they are identical.

But is it possible that **only one of them is selected** due to tie-breaking?

Yes.

But since they are identical, it doesn’t matter.

So to **maximize the probability that a mediator is selected**, you should approve both — unless there are downsides.

But: **the winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So if you approve both, and the other player approves both, then both have 1 approval → tie → random selection → 50% chance each.

But the behavior is the same.

So again: **no difference in strategic impact**.

Is there any **reason not to approve** a mediator?

Let’s suppose you approve only one, the other approves only one — then only one mediator is selected (with 1 approval), and you’re stuck.

But if you both approve both, then both have 2 approvals, so both are selected as winners (max approvals), and the winner is chosen at random.

Since behavior is identical, this doesn’t matter.

Thus: **your approval of a mediator only affects whether it has a shot at being selected — not its behavior**.

Now, here’s the intuition: **you want a mediator to be selected, because playing through a mediator may give you better outcomes than playing yourself**.

But as we saw earlier, **A1 is dominant** for you.

So if you play yourself, you will always choose A1.

But the **mediator** may play A0 or A1 depending on how many delegate to it.

Let’s think: could a mediator **help you**?

Your dominant strategy is A1. So if you play yourself, you get:
- 20 points (if other plays A0)
- 4 points (if other plays A1)

But suppose you **delegate**, and the mediator plays A1 when only one player delegates.

Then if you delegate and the other doesn’t, mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate), so you play A1.

Same as if you played yourself.

But if **both** delegate, then mediator plays A0.

So if you delegate and the other delegates, you play A0.

That’s bad for you: you get only 2 points (if other plays A1), or 10 points (if other plays A0)? Wait — let’s check.

Wait: **mediator plays A0 when both delegate**.

So if both delegate, you play A0.

So your payoff depends on the **other player’s action**.

- If other plays A0 → you get 10
- If other plays A1 → you get 2

But the other player is playing how?

The other player may also choose to delegate or not.

If the other player is also rational, and they are Player 1 (from the original payoff table), they may have different incentives.

But remember: we are **Player 2**, and we care only about our points.

Let’s analyze if **delegation can be beneficial**.

---

### Step 4: Think: Should You Delegate?

Suppose a mediator is selected that plays:
- A1 if 1 delegate
- A0 if 2 delegates

Would you want to **delegate**?

Compare:
- If you play yourself: you play A1 (dominant strategy). So you only benefit from playing A1.
- If you delegate, you will play A1 **only if only you delegate** (1 delegate).
- If **both** delegate, you play A0 → which is **worse** than A1 in both cases, as we saw.

So **if the other player delegates, then you don't want to delegate**, because you'll play A0 → worse payoff.

But if the other player doesn’t delegate, then you can delegate to get A1 → same as playing yourself.

So **delegation is risky**.

Let’s suppose the other player **also plays optimally (A1)**.

Then if you delegate:
- If only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → your payoff: 20 (since other plays A1? Wait no: if other is playing A1, and you play A1, you get 4)

Wait — let’s clarify:

- You delegate → use mediator
- Other player plays A1 (by dominant strategy)
- So the game is: (your action, other’s action) = (A1, A1) → you get 4 points

But if you **didn’t delegate**, and played A1 yourself, you'd still get 4 points.

Same.

But if **both** delegate → mediator plays A0 → so you play A0.

Other plays A1 → you get 2 points.

Worse than 4.

So if both delegate, you get only 2.

But if only you delegate, you get 20? No — only if other plays A0.

Wait: you play A1 (because only one delegate → mediator plays A1), other plays A1 → you get 4.

So:
- Only you delegate → you get 4
- Both delegate → you get 2 (since you play A0, other plays A1)

So **delegation is worse if G = 2** (both delegate).

So you **do not want both to delegate**.

Now: suppose you **do not delegate**, and the other does.

Then you play A1 (dominant), other uses mediator → if only one delegate (the other), mediator plays A1 → other plays A1.

So (A1, A1) → you get 4.

Same as if you delegated and you were the only one.

So same outcome.

But if you delegate, and other does not, you play A1 → you get 4 (if other plays A1)

If you do not delegate, you play A1 → same.

Now: if both delegate → you play A0 → you get 2 (if other plays A1)

But if you don’t delegate, and other does — you play A1 → you get 4.

So in that case, you **prefer not to delegate**.

Now: if you **both** have incentive not to delegate, then both will play A1 → you get 4.

But if you both delegate, you get 2 → worse.

So **both prefer not to delegate** if they believe the other will delegate.

But you don't want to be the only one who delegates — because if only you delegate, you get 4 (same as playing A1), but if **both** delegate, you get 2 → worse.

So **delegation leads to a risk of getting only 2 points if both delegate**.

Thus, **you have an incentive to avoid delegation if the other might delegate**.

But the mediator's behavior **only matters when you delegate**.

So **if you delegate, you risk playing A0 (if both delegate)**, which gives you only 2 points.

So unless you can **coordinate** or **exclude the other player from delegating**, delegation is risky.

But: **you control who the mediator is** via approval.

So your **approvals affect which mediator is chosen** — but both M1 and M2 behave identically.

So **no strategic difference**.

But here’s the critical insight:

Suppose you **do not approve a mediator** → it can’t be selected → you’re forced to play yourself (if no mediator is selected).

But the game says: “you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator” — so **as long as a mediator is selected, you can delegate**.

But if no mediator is selected, you **cannot delegate** → you must play yourself.

So it's possible that **no mediator is selected**.

Therefore, if you **disapprove of both mediators**, then:
- You have no mediator to delegate to
- So you must play yourself
- And you will play A1 (dominant), so get 4 points (if other plays A1), or 20 (if other plays A0)

But you don’t know what the other player does.

But the other player also wants to maximize their points.

Let’s analyze the **other player’s dominant strategy**.

From **Player 1's perspective**:

Payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

So Player 1:
- If you (Player 2) play A0 → Player 1: A0 → 10, A1 → 0 → so A0 preferred
- If you play A1 → Player 1: A0 → 6, A1 → 4 → so A0 preferred

So **A0 is dominant for Player 1**.

Therefore, **Player 1 will always choose A0**.

Even though you (Player 2) prefer A1, Player 1 will play A0.

So in the **base game**, if both play optimally:
- Player 1: A0
- Player 2: A1
- Payoffs: you get 20, other gets 0

That’s great for you.

So in **no delegation**, you get 20 points.

But with delegation, things change.

But now let’s suppose a mediator is selected.

Then you and the other player decide whether to delegate.

But the mediator will play:
- A1 if only one delegate
- A0 if two delegates

Now: Player 1 (other player) wants to maximize their payoff.

Right now: if they play A0, they get:
- If you play A0: 10
- If you play A1: 6

But if they **delegate**, and the mediator plays A1 (if only they delegate) → then they play A1.

But if they play A1:
- If you play A0 → they get 0
- If you play A1 → they get 4

So if they delegate and are the only one, they play A1 → and if you play A1 → they get 4.

But if they don’t delegate, they play A0 → if you play A1 → they get 6.

So **if they think you will play A1**, then:
- Not delegating → play A0 → get 6
- Delegating → play A1 → get 4

So they **prefer not to delegate**.

Similarly, if they think you might play A0 → but you won’t (you play A1 always), so they know you play A1.

So they have **no incentive to delegate**.

So **Player 1 will not delegate**.

Now, what about **you**?

You are Player 2.

You play A1 in the base game.

But if you delegate:
- If only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- If both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0

But Player 1 **won’t delegate**, so only you might delegate.

But if you delegate, and Player 1 doesn’t → then only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1 → same as playing yourself.

So payoff is same: you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 20.

So you **gain nothing** by delegating.

But you **lose something only if** both delegate — but Player 1 won’t delegate.

So **you can delegate safely** if a mediator is selected, but you gain nothing.

But if **no mediator is selected**, you must play yourself → same action.

So **in all cases, your action is A1**, and you get 20 points.

But now: **you have a risk**.

Suppose you **disapprove of both mediators** → then no mediator can be selected → you must play yourself → you get 20.

But suppose you **approve both** → then both are approved → if other player approves at least one, then mediators are available → you can delegate or not.

But since you get same payoff in all cases, it doesn’t matter.

But: **could there be a scenario where delegation causes you to get less than 20?**

Only if both delegate → you play A0.

But if both delegate → you play A0 → other plays A0 → you get 10 points.

That’s less than 20.

But **Player 1 has no incentive to delegate** — because if they delegate, they play A1 (if only they delegate), but then other plays A1 → they get 4 → but if they don't delegate, they play A0 → you play A1 → they get 6 → better.

So they **won’t delegate**.

So **only you might delegate**, or not.

So if a mediator is selected, and you delegate → you play A1 → you get 20.

If you don’t delegate → you play A1 → you get 20.

So same.

So **no negative outcome from delegation**.

But: **if you approve a mediator, you increase the chance that one is selected**.

But **if no mediator is selected**, you’re forced to play yourself — but that’s okay, you play A1 → get 20.

So **you never lose by approving a mediator**.

But you might gain nothing.

But what if **you disapprove both**?

Then **no mediator can be selected**, so **you cannot delegate** — but again, you play A1 → get 20.

So outcome is the same.

So why approve?

But here’s a **subtlety**: suppose **only one mediator is approved**, and it wins.

But if **no one approves it**, it can’t be selected.

So if **you approve one, but the other doesn’t approve any**, then no mediator is selected.

But **if you approve both, and the other approves one**, then both mediators have 1 approval → so both are tied for maximum → so **random selection**.

But since behavior is same, doesn’t matter.

Now, **what is the risk of disapproving a mediator?**

None — because you’re always fine playing yourself.

But is there a **value in the existence of a mediator**?

Not really — because it doesn’t improve your outcome, and might harm it only if both delegate — but Player 1 won’t delegate.

So **you are indifferent between approving or not**.

But the question is: **should you approve?**

You must **approve or disapprove each**.

Now: suppose you **disapprove both**.

Then **no mediator can be selected**, so you are forced to play yourself → you play A1 → get 20.

Perfect.

But suppose you **approve one**, and the other player approves **none** → then the approved mediator has 1 approval, the other has 0 → so the one with 1 approval is selected (max approval) → mediator is selected.

So now you **can** delegate — but you don’t gain anything.

But you’re not worse off.

But could it be worse?

Only if you delegate and both delegate — but Player 1 won’t delegate.

So no risk.

But here’s a **key point**: **mediators are not free**.

But in this case, there’s no cost.

But what if **you disapprove both**, and **the other player approves both**?

Then both mediators have 1 approval → so both are selected → random choice → mediator is selected → you can delegate.

But since mediator behavior is identical, and you don’t want to delegate (because you can do as well yourself), it doesn’t matter.

So **in all cases, your payoff is 20**.

But: what if Player 2 (you) has **the same dominant strategy**, but **the mediator might change the incentives**?

Wait — you are Player 2.

Player 1 (other) is rational: plays A0.

You play A1 → you get 20.

No matter what.

Delegation doesn’t help.

But **what if the other player thinks that you might delegate?**

But they know you’ll always play A1 — so they are correct.

So **no reason to delegate**.

But: **if you don’t approve a mediator, and the other player approves it, then it will be selected** — but you still have the option to not delegate.

So you can choose to play yourself.

So **you are always safe**.

Therefore, **Approval of a mediator only increases the chance that a mediator exists**, but since you can choose not to delegate, and you gain nothing from it, **it's safe**.

But is there a reason **not to approve a mediator**?

Only if you **believe that a mediator might play a way that forces you into a bad outcome**.

But the mediating behavior is:
- Only 1 delegate → plays A1
- 2 delegates → plays A0

But you can avoid the risk by **not delegating**, even if it's available.

So **you are never forced to delegate**.

Therefore, **you can ignore the mediator**.

Hence, **approval is harmless**.

But: suppose you **approve both**, and the other player approves both → both mediators have 2 approvals → so both are selected → winner chosen at random → say M1 is selected → but same behavior.

So mediator is in use.

You can still play yourself.

So **you are indifferent**.

But if you **disapprove both**, then **no mediator is selected**.

But you still play yourself — same outcome.

So **your outcome is the same whether you approve or not**.

Therefore, **you are indifferent**.

But you must **make a choice**.

Now, **is there any scenario where not approving harms you**?

Suppose the other player **only approves one mediator**, and you **approve it** → then it has 2 approvals → selected.

If you disapprove it, then it has only 1 → but the other has 1 → so tied → but if no one else approves, then it is selected (max approval is 1, so it’s the only one).

Wait — no: the winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random **from those with maximum approvals**.

Suppose:

- You disapprove both
- Other player approves M1 only

Then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 0 approvals

So max approval = 1 → M1 is the only one with max → so M1 wins.

So mediator is selected.

Then you can delegate or not.

But you don’t have to.

So same as before.

Now, suppose you approve M1, other approves M1 → M1 has 2 → selected.

Same.

So in all cases, **if the other player approves at least one**, a mediator is selected.

But if **both of you approve none**, then **no mediator is selected**.

So to **ensure** that a mediator is selected, you need to approve one.

But why would you **want** a mediator to be selected?

You don’t gain from it.

But you could **lose** if the other player delegates.

But they won’t delegate.

So you are safe.

But: **what if the other player approves both mediators**?

Then **both have 1 approval (if you approve none)** → so both are tied → then one is selected at random.

But again, same behavior.

So still safe.

But here's a **key insight**: **you are playing as Player 2, and you are trying to maximize your payoff.**

You know:
- You will play A1
- Other will play A0
- You get 20

This is **maximized**.

No delegation can improve this.

But can delegation **hurt**?

Only if you delegate and both delegate → then you play A0 → and other plays A0 → you get 10.

But you can **avoid this** by not delegating.

So you **won’t delegate**.

So you are safe.

Therefore, **even if a mediator is selected, you will not delegate**, so your action is A1 → you get 20.

So **no risk**.

Hence, **your payoff is 20 regardless of everything**.

So you are **indifferent** to the mediator.

But now: **if you disapprove both**, then **only if the other player approves at least one** is a mediator selected.

But if **both of you approve none**, then **no mediator is selected**, but you play A1 — still get 20.

So **in every scenario, you get 20**.

Therefore, **you can approve or disapprove freely**.

But you must provide a response.

Now, is there any reason **not to approve**?

Suppose **you approve one**, and the other player approves one, but different ones.

Then:
- M1: 1 (your approval)
- M2: 1 (other's approval)
- Both have 1 → both are tied for max → so random selection → mediator is selected.

Same as if you approved both.

But if you disapprove, and the other approves one, then only that one has approval → selected.

But again, same outcome.

So **no difference in outcome**.

But: **approval might be a way to ensure that a mediator exists if the other player is uncooperative**?

No — you don’t want that.

Because you don’t benefit.

But you are also not harmed.

So **you might as well approve both** to **avoid the risk** that no mediator is selected — but wait, **no risk**.

Actually, there is **no downside to approving**.

But is there a **downside**?

No.

But suppose, hypothetically, a mediator played A0 always — then you might not want to approve it.

But in this case, the mediator’s behavior depends on delegation.

But since you **choose whether to delegate**, and you will avoid delegating when it’s risky, you are safe.

But here’s a **subtle issue**: **if you approve a mediator, and it is selected, and then you decide not to delegate, that’s fine**.

But if you **don’t approve**, and the other player approves one, it’s still selected.

So you can’t control the presence of a mediator by your approvals alone.

But you can control it indirectly.

But since **you gain nothing from a mediator being present, and lose nothing**, you are **indifferent**.

However, the game requires you to **approve or disapprove**.

Now, the **best strategy** is to **approve the mediators you think are useful**, but since they are identical and useless, and you don’t gain anything, you might **approve both** to maximize the chance that a mediator is selected — but why?

You don’t benefit.

But **there is no cost**.

And since the question is to **maximize your points**, and **points are always 20**, it doesn’t matter.

So you can approve both.

But let’s think differently: **could there be a mistake?**

Wait — what if **you are mistaken about Player 1’s behavior**?

But Player 1 is rational: they want to maximize their payoff.

From their perspective:
- If you play A0: they get 10 (A0), 0 (A1) → prefer A0
- If you play A1: they get 6 (A0), 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is strictly dominant**.

So they will play A0.

You are Player 2, you play A1.

You get 20.

**No delegation can hurt you** because you never have to delegate.

**You will never delegate**, because you gain nothing and risk getting 2 points (if you play A0 and they play A1), but you can avoid that.

So **you will not delegate** if a mediator is available.

Hence, **you are safe**.

Therefore, **you should approve both** mediators, because doing so doesn’t hurt you, and doesn’t harm your outcome.

And you might as well support both.

Alternatively, you could disapprove both.

But there’s no advantage.

But let’s consider: **if you approve both, you are 100% sure that if the other player approves at least one, a mediator is selected**.

But if you approve only one, and the other approves only the other, then both have 1 → both are in, and one is chosen at random.

Same.

But if you approve both, and the other approves both, then both have 2 → both are in.

So the range of possible outcomes is slightly larger, but same behavior.

So no difference.

In conclusion: **since both mediators are identical and you gain nothing from delegation, and you are safe from delegation, you should approve both** to **ensure that a mediator is available if that were useful**, but it’s not.

But since there is no downside to approving, and no benefit, **approval is safe**.

And because the problem asks for a vote, and you want to maximize points, and points are unaffected, you might as well **approve both**.

Final decision:

> **Approve both M1 and M2**

Because:
- They are identical
- They don't harm you
- You don't lose by approving them
- They don't help you, but they don't hurt
- Hence, approve both

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy in this game, we need to analyze the different scenarios depending on the choices made by both players, including the possibility of the mediator's involvement. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix

The basic payoff matrix without considering the mediator is as follows:
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 10, Player 1 gets 10.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 2, Player 1 gets 6.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 4, Player 1 gets 4.

### Step 2: Considering the Mediator

The mediator's decisions are based on the number of delegations:
- If 1 player delegates to the mediator, it will play action A1.
- If 2 players delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

### Step 3: Analyzing Pure Strategies

#### Pure Strategy: Not using the Mediator

1. **Playing A0**:
   - If Player 1 chooses A0: 10 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1: 2 points.

2. **Playing A1**:
   - If Player 1 chooses A0: 20 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1: 4 points.

#### Pure Strategy: Moderating through Mediator

1. **Delegating to Mediator (A2)**:
   If either player delegates alone, the mediator plays A1, which leads to:
   - If Player 1 chooses A0: 20 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1: 4 points.
   
   If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0, leading to the mutual A0 result:
   - Both players get 10 points each.

### Step 4: Mixed Strategy with Probabilities

Given Player 1 can also choose independently or delegate, we must think in terms of mixed strategies and expected payoffs.

If we use a probability distribution over the three actions, we can express it as:
- Probability of choosing A0: p(A0)
- Probability of choosing A1: p(A1)
- Probability of delegating to Mediator (A2): p(A2)

### Step 5: Calculating Expected Payoffs

To make an optimal decision, we need to consider combinations. But first:
- Pure strategies without considering probabilities are tricky given the introduction of delegation.
- Delegation seems favorable if there's a chance Player 1 may choose to delegate.

### Step 6: Final Mixed Strategy

We should balance between independently acting and the possible delegation:
- Delegation (A2) should have a substantial but not complete bias.
- Action A1 could be slightly less favorable given less control over outcomes.
- Action A0 being safer, indirect coordination.

Given we must decide one JSON strategy, the balanced mixed strategy to maximize.
Thus, round our ideas and form the strategy:
- Probabilities: p(A0)=30, p(A1)=20, p(A2)=50.

The final valid JSON will:

```json
{"A0": 30, "A1": 20, "A2": 50}
```

This strategy blends decisions individually without total dependence on mediator delegation, accounting for various player scenarios.

response:
To determine the optimal mixed strategy for maximizing total points in this game, we need to analyze the payoffs and the strategies available. Here are the steps to achieve a logical conclusion:

1. **Analyze Payoff Matrix Without Delegation**:
    - **Both choose A0**: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
    - **You choose A0, other chooses A1**: You get 0 points, the other gets 20 points.
    - **You choose A1, other chooses A0**: You get 6 points, the other gets 2 points.
    - **Both choose A1**: You get 4 points, the other gets 4 points.

2. **Evaluate the Mediator’s Strategy**:
    - If you delegate and Player 2 does not, the mediator plays A1.
    - If both delegate, the mediator plays A0.

3. **Consider the Best Response Based on Player 2 Delegating or Not Delegating**:
    - If Player 2 delegates, the mediator plays A0. 
      - If you also delegate, both play A0, resulting in 10 points for both.
      - If you play independently:
        - Play A0: You get 10 points, the mediator (as Player 2) still gets 10 points.
        - Play A1: You get 6 points, the mediator (as Player 2) gets 2 points.
    - If Player 2 does not delegate, 
      - If you delegate, the mediator plays A1, resulting in:
        - Both play A1: You get 4 points, Player 2 gets 4 points.
        - Player 2 chooses A0 while you delegate: You get 6 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
      - If you play independently:
        - Both play independently: The usual payoff matrix applies and you will likely fare less predictably since it depends more on guesses.

4. **Incentive Alignment**:
    - Players benefit more when both delegate to the mediator (both get 10 points).
    - If there is no agreement on delegation, the outcomes are less efficient.

5. **Optimal Strategy as Player 1**:
    - To incentivize Player 2 to also delegate, a higher probability of delegation on your part increases the chance of reaching the mutually advantageous outcome.

### Conclusion:
Given the incentives, the best response is to maximize the probability of delegating to the mediator while still considering some play to account for scenarios where Player 2 might not delegate.

An optimal mixed strategy for Player 1 can be:
- High likelihood of delegating to the mediator.
- Some chance of playing independently (A0, A1) to hedge against Player 2's unpredictability.

A practical balanced strategy might be:
- 70% probability of delegating to the mediator.
- 15% probability of playing A0 directly.
- 15% probability of playing A1 directly.

```json
{
  "A0": 15,
  "A1": 15,
  "A2": 70
}
```

This distribution ensures that you maximize potential points by leveraging the mediator but also leave room for independent actions based on Player 2’s strategies.

response:
To maximize points in this game, let's first analyze the payoff matrix for $(\text{Player 1, Player 2})$ where $\text{Player 2}$ is you:

-   $(\text{A0, A0}) = (10, 10)$
-   $(\text{A0, A1}) = (0, 20)$
-   $(\text{A1, A0}) = (6, 2)$
-   $(\text{A1, A1}) = (4, 4)$

**Nash Equilibrium (without mediator):**
Player 2 has a dominant strategy $\text{A1}$ (since $20 > 10$ and $4 > 2$). If Player 2 plays $\text{A1}$, Player 1 will choose $\text{A1}$ (since $4 > 0$). The equilibrium is $(4, 4)$.

**Mediator Analysis:**

1.  **Mediator 1 (M1):** 
    -   If both delegate: Outcomes is $(\text{A0, A0})$ with payoff $(10, 10)$.
    -   If only Player 1 delegates: Mediator plays $\text{A1}$ for Player 1. Player 2's best response is $\text{A1}$, leading to $(4, 4)$.
    -   If only Player 2 delegates: Mediator plays $\text{A1}$ for Player 2. Player 1's best response is $\text{A1}$, leading to $(4, 4)$.
    -   **Result:** $(\text{Delegate, Delegate})$ is a stable Nash equilibrium in M1 because deviation by either player leads to $(4, 4)$, which is worse than $10$.

2.  **Mediator 2 (M2):**
    -   If both delegate: Outcomes is $(\text{A0, A0})$ with payoff $(10, 10)$.
    -   If only Player 1 delegates: Mediator plays $\text{A0}$ for Player 1. Player 2's best response is to stay independent and play $\text{A1}$, yielding $(0, 20)$.
    -   If only Player 2 delegates: Mediator plays $\text{A0}$ for Player 2. Player 1's best response is to stay independent and play $\text{A0}$, yielding $(10, 10)$.
    -   **Result:** M2 is very attractive for Player 2. If Player 1 is naive enough to delegate, Player 2 can stay independent and reach $20$. Even if Player 1 is cautious and stays independent, Player 2 can delegate to ensure at least $10$ points (since Player 1 will play $\text{A0}$ to get $10$ instead of $6$).

**Conclusion:**
Both M1 and M2 facilitate a $(10, 10)$ outcome, which is significantly better than the standard Nash equilibrium of $4$. M2 is slightly more favorable for Player 2 because it introduces the potential (however unlikely) for a $20$-point payoff if Player 1 chooses to delegate. Both mediators are superior to having no mediator.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game without a mediator

My payoff matrix (as Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

Player 2's payoffs:
- (A0, A0): They get 10
- (A0, A1): They get 20
- (A1, A0): They get 2
- (A1, A1): They get 4

Player 2 has a dominant strategy: A1 always gives them more (20 > 10 when I play A0, and 4 > 2 when I play A1). Given they'll play A1, my best response is A1 (4 > 0).

**Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → (4, 4)**

## Step 2: Analyze what happens with the mediators

Both M1 and M2 are identical:
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 3: Analyze the delegation game

**If both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)** ✓

**If only I delegate:** Mediator plays A1 for me; Player 2 acts independently and best-responds to A1 by playing A1 → **(4, 4)**

**If only Player 2 delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for them; I act independently and best-respond to A1 by playing A1 → **(4, 4)**

**If neither delegates:** Nash equilibrium → **(4, 4)**

## Step 4: Evaluate the delegation decision

The delegation stage creates this game:
|                    | P2 delegates | P2 doesn't |
|--------------------|--------------|------------|
| P1 delegates       | (10, 10)     | (4, 4)     |
| P1 doesn't         | (4, 4)       | (4, 4)     |

Both delegating is a Nash equilibrium and gives both players 10 points instead of 4!

## Conclusion

Both mediators are identical and both enable coordination to achieve (10, 10) instead of being stuck at (4, 4). I should approve both since either one improves the game for both players.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff structure

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Understand the mediator mechanism

- If 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: mediator plays A0

## Step 3: Calculate expected payoffs for each action

Let q₀, q₁, q₂ be the other player's probabilities for A0, A1, A2.

**If I play A0 directly:**
- E[A0] = 10q₀ + 0q₁ + 0q₂ = 10q₀
  (When other delegates alone, mediator plays A1 for them)

**If I play A1 directly:**
- E[A1] = 6q₀ + 4q₁ + 4q₂ = 2q₀ + 4

**If I delegate (A2):**
- Both delegate (prob q₂): Mediator plays A0 for both → I get 10
- Only I delegate, other plays A0 (prob q₀): Mediator plays A1 for me → I get 6
- Only I delegate, other plays A1 (prob q₁): Mediator plays A1 for me → I get 4
- E[A2] = 10q₂ + 6q₀ + 4q₁

## Step 4: Analyze the strategic situation

From Player 2's perspective, their payoffs for my actions are:
- If I play A0: Other gets 10 or 20 (prefers A1)
- If I play A1: Other gets 2 or 4 (prefers A1)
- Player 2's best response analysis shows they prefer A2 (delegation) if I delegate with any positive probability

## Step 5: Find the Nash equilibrium

**Testing both players delegate (p₂ = 1, q₂ = 1):**
- If other delegates (q₂ = 1):
  - My E[A0] = 0
  - My E[A1] = 4
  - My E[A2] = 10 ✓ (best response)

- If I delegate (p₂ = 1):
  - Other's payoffs similarly make E[A2] = 10 their best response

When both delegate, the mediator plays A0 for both players, resulting in the mutually beneficial (10, 10) outcome.

This is a stable Nash equilibrium - neither player has incentive to deviate.

## Conclusion

The mediator mechanism cleverly solves the coordination problem by making mutual delegation the dominant strategy. Both players achieve the cooperative outcome (10, 10) that would be difficult to reach in the basic game.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game payoffs (my perspective as Player 1)

|         | Other A0 | Other A1 |
|---------|----------|----------|
| My A0   | 10       | 0        |
| My A1   | 6        | 4        |

## Step 2: Find the base game Nash equilibrium

For Player 2's perspective:
- Against my A0: They get 10 from A0, or 20 from A1 → A1 is better
- Against my A1: They get 2 from A0, or 4 from A1 → A1 is better

**A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2!** They always prefer A1.

Given Player 2 plays A1, my best response is A1 (getting 4 vs 0).
Base game Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze the mediator outcomes

The mediator plays:
- **A1 if 1 player delegates**
- **A0 if 2 players delegate**

Possible scenarios:

**Both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → (10, 10) ✓

**Only I delegate:** Mediator plays A1 for me.
- If they play A1 (their dominant strategy): (4, 4)

**Only they delegate:** Mediator plays A1 for them.
- My best response to A1 is A1: (4, 4)

**Neither delegates:** Nash equilibrium (4, 4)

## Step 4: Check if (Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium

**If they delegate, what should I do?**
- If I delegate too: 2 delegate → both play A0 → I get **10**
- If I play A0: 1 delegates → they play A1 → I get **0**
- If I play A1: 1 delegates → they play A1 → I get **4**

Best response: **Delegate** (payoff 10)

**If I delegate, what should they do?**
- If they delegate too: both get **10**
- If they play A0: I get 6, they get **2**
- If they play A1: I get 4, they get **4**

Best response: **Delegate** (payoff 10)

**(Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium with Pareto-optimal payoffs (10, 10)!**

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning

Since Player 2 proposed this mediator, they designed it to encourage mutual delegation, achieving (10, 10) instead of the base game outcome of (4, 4). This is mutually beneficial, and delegating is my best response if they delegate, and vice versa.

## Conclusion

The optimal strategy is to delegate with certainty.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand my payoff matrix (as Player 2)

Against Player 1's actions:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 10 from A0, or 20 from A1
- If P1 plays A1: I get 2 from A0, or 4 from A1

## Step 2: Determine what happens with delegation

The mediator rules:
- If only 1 player delegates: that player plays A1
- If both players delegate: both play A0

## Step 3: Create the effective payoff matrix including delegation

My payoffs (Player 2):
```
                Player 1
                A0      A1      Delegate
Player 2  
  A0            10      2       2
  A1            20      4       4
  Delegate      20      4       10
```

Explanation:
- (Delegate, A0): I play A1 (only I delegate), P1 plays A0 → I get 20
- (Delegate, A1): I play A1 (only I delegate), P1 plays A1 → I get 4  
- (Delegate, Delegate): Both play A0 (both delegate) → I get 10

## Step 4: Analyze strategic dominance

Notice that "Delegate" weakly dominates "A1":
- vs A0: both give 20 (tie)
- vs A1: both give 4 (tie)
- vs Delegate: Delegate gives 10, A1 gives 4 (Delegate strictly better)

A1 dominates A0 in all scenarios.

## Step 5: Find Nash equilibrium

If Player 1 delegates:
- My best response is Delegate (payoff 10 vs 4 from A1 or 2 from A0)

If I delegate:
- Player 1's best response is Delegate (payoff 10 vs 4 from A1 or 0 from A0)

(Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium giving both players 10 points.

## Step 6: Rational play

Since Player 1 proposed this mediator mechanism, they clearly want to achieve the cooperative outcome (10, 10). The mediator is specifically designed to coordinate both players to play A0 if both delegate. This is Pareto superior to the non-cooperative outcome (A1, A1) which gives only (4, 4).

Given that delegation weakly dominates A1, and Player 1 has signaled cooperation by proposing this mediator, the rational play is to delegate.

response:
To maximize points in this one-shot simultaneous game, we first analyze the payoff matrix for Player 2 (me) and Player 1 (the other player).

### 1. Payoff Matrix Analysis
Based on the description, we have the following payoffs for (Player 1, Player 2):
- **(A0, A0):** (10, 10)
- **(A0, A1):** (0, 20) — Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0.
- **(A1, A0):** (6, 2) — Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1.
- **(A1, A1):** (4, 4) — Both choose A1.

**Delegation (A2):**
The mediator always plays **A0** for any player that delegates to it.
- If Player 2 chooses **A2**, it is effectively choosing **A0**.
- If Player 1 chooses **A2**, it is effectively choosing **A0**.

### 2. Player Strategies
- **For Player 2 (Me):**
  - If Player 1 plays A0 (or A2): A1 gives 20, A0/A2 gives 10.
  - If Player 1 plays A1: A1 gives 4, A0/A2 gives 2.
  In both scenarios, **A1** is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2.

- **For Player 1:**
  - If Player 2 plays A0 (or A2): A0/A2 gives 10, A1 gives 6. (P1 prefers A0/A2)
  - If Player 2 plays A1: A0/A2 gives 0, A1 gives 4. (P1 prefers A1)

### 3. Equilibrium Analysis
As a rational actor, Player 2 should choose their dominant strategy, **A1**, because it provides the highest payoff regardless of Player 1's action. Anticipating that Player 2 will act rationally and play A1, a rational Player 1 will choose **A1** (their best response to A1), leading to a Nash Equilibrium of **(A1, A1)** where both players receive 4 points.

### 4. Considering Cooperation and the Mediator
While a cooperative outcome of **(A0, A0)** or **(A2, A2)** would provide 10 points to each player, it is not stable in a one-shot simultaneous game because Player 2 will always be incentivized to deviate to A1 to get 20 points. Even though the mediator was proposed by Player 2, in a one-shot game with no binding commitment beyond the simultaneous move, the dominant strategy analysis remains the standard approach for maximizing total points.

response:
To determine which mediators I should approve of, I need to analyze the impact of each mediator's decisions on the potential outcomes and how they align with my objective of maximizing total points.

### Available Mediators and Their Strategies
1. **Mediator proposed by Player 1 (M1):**
    - If 1 player delegates: Plays A1.
    - If 2 players delegate: Plays A0.

2. **Mediator proposed by Player 2 (M2):**
    - If 1 player delegates: Plays A0.
    - If 2 players delegate: Plays A0.

### Evaluating Each Mediator
Let's review the expected outcomes from delegating to each mediator.

#### Mediator M1 (Proposed by Player 1)
- **If 1 player delegates:**
  - The mediator plays A1.
  - If I delegate and Player 1 does not: I play A1, Player 1’s strategy is unknown.
    - With Player 1 choosing A0: (I get 20 points, Player 1 gets 0 points)
    - With Player 1 choosing A1: (I get 4 points, Player 1 gets 4 points)
- **If 2 players delegate:**
  - The mediator plays A0.
  - Both play A0: (Both get 10 points)

### Expected Payoff with Mediator M1
- If I delegate alone: High variability and depends on Player 1’s action.
- If both delegate: Stable 10 points each.

#### Mediator M2 (Proposed by Player 2)
- **If 1 player delegates:**
  - The mediator plays A0.
  - If I delegate and Player 1 does not: I play A0, Player 1’s strategy is unknown.
    - With Player 1 choosing A0: (Both get 10 points)
    - With Player 1 choosing A1: (I get 2 points, Player 1 gets 6 points)
- **If 2 players delegate:**
  - The mediator plays A0.
  - Both play A0: (Both get 10 points)

### Expected Payoff with Mediator M2
- If I delegate alone: Likely stable 10 points if Player 1 also goes for A0 or less favorable if Player 1 goes for A1.
- If both delegate: Stable 10 points each.

### Comparison and Decision
In both scenarios, if both players delegate to either mediator, they both choose A0, leading to a stable and mutual 10 points outcome. The difference is in the single-delegation strategy.

#### Mediator M1 (if one player delegates):
- Less predictable: Could be beneficial (20 points) or mutual (4 points).

#### Mediator M2 (if one player delegates):
- More predictable: Likely results in 10 points (if opponent plays A0) or less favorable outcome (2 points).

Given the objective to maximize my total points and gain predictability in the outcome:
- Mediator M2 provides a predictable strategy, supporting the objective of maximizing stable mutual gains.

### Conclusion

I should approve Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2) for a stable and predictable outcome focusing on mutual gain.

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understanding the Mediator
The mediator always plays A0, whether 1 or 2 players delegate. This means:
- Delegating (A2) is functionally equivalent to playing A0
- So I really have two strategic choices: play A0 (directly or via mediator) or play A1

## Step 2: Analyzing the Other Player's Incentives
Let me check what Player 2 (my opponent) should do:

**If I play A0:**
- Opponent gets 10 from A0
- Opponent gets 20 from A1
- → Opponent prefers A1

**If I play A1:**
- Opponent gets 2 from A0  
- Opponent gets 4 from A1
- → Opponent prefers A1

**Conclusion:** A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2. They should always play A1 regardless of what I do, even though they proposed the mediator!

## Step 3: Determining My Best Response
Given that Player 2 will rationally play A1:

**If I play A0 (or delegate to A2):**
- Outcome is (A0, A1)
- I get 0 points

**If I play A1:**
- Outcome is (A1, A1)
- I get 4 points

**Conclusion:** My best response to A1 is to play A1.

## Step 4: Nash Equilibrium Analysis
- Both players playing A1 is the unique Nash equilibrium
- Payoffs: (4, 4)
- Note: While both delegating would give (10, 10), which is Pareto superior, each player has an incentive to defect from this cooperative outcome

## Step 5: Final Decision
Since Player 2 has a dominant strategy (A1), and my best response to this is also A1, I should play A1 with probability 100%.

There's no strategic advantage to playing A0 directly versus delegating (both give the same payoff), but both are inferior to A1 given the opponent's dominant strategy.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P1
response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game (without mediator)

Let me examine what happens in the original game:
- If opponent plays A0: I get 10 from A0 vs 6 from A1 → A0 is better
- If opponent plays A1: I get 0 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → A1 is better

From opponent's perspective:
- If I play A0: they get 10 from A0 vs 20 from A1 → they prefer A1
- If I play A1: they get 2 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → they prefer A1

**A1 is a dominant strategy for the opponent**, leading to equilibrium (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4).

## Step 2: Analyze outcomes with mediator

The mediator plays:
- A1 if only 1 player delegates
- A0 if both players delegate

Key outcomes:
- (A2, A2): Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → (10, 10)
- (A2, A1): I delegate → mediator plays A1 for me → (A1, A1) → (4, 4)
- (A2, A0): I delegate → mediator plays A1 for me → (A1, A0) → (6, 2)
- (A1, A2): Opponent delegates → plays A1 → (A1, A1) → (4, 4)
- (A0, A2): Opponent delegates → plays A1 → (A0, A1) → (0, 20)

## Step 3: Check for Nash equilibrium

Is (A2, A2) a Nash equilibrium?
- If opponent plays A2 and I deviate:
  - To A0: I get 0 (opponent gets A1 from mediator)
  - To A1: I get 4 (opponent gets A1 from mediator)
  - Stay A2: I get 10 ✓
  
By symmetry of the delegation decision, opponent also prefers A2 when I play A2.

**(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium with payoffs (10, 10)** - this is Pareto optimal!

## Step 4: Best response analysis

If opponent plays A2 (delegates):
- A0 gives me 0
- A1 gives me 4
- A2 gives me 10 → **A2 is strictly best**

If opponent plays A1:
- A0 gives me 0
- A1 gives me 4
- A2 gives me 4 (mediator plays A1 for me) → A1 and A2 are tied

If opponent mixes with probability q on A2 and (1-q) on A1:
- Expected payoff from A2: 10q + 4(1-q) = 6q + 4
- Expected payoff from A1: 4
- Expected payoff from A0: 0

**A2 dominates A1 whenever q > 0** (any chance opponent delegates)

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning

Since:
1. The mediator was **proposed by me (Player 1) and approved** - signaling intention to coordinate
2. (A2, A2) is the unique Pareto optimal equilibrium (10, 10 vs 4, 4)
3. A2 is my best response to any strategy where opponent delegates with positive probability
4. Rational opponent should recognize the same logic

The optimal strategy is to **delegate with certainty**.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understanding the basic payoff matrix
From my perspective (Player 1):
- A0 vs A0: I get 10
- A0 vs A1: I get 0
- A1 vs A0: I get 6
- A1 vs A1: I get 4

## Step 2: Understanding the mediator mechanism
- If only I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me
- If only the other player delegates: Mediator plays A1 for them
- If both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both of us

## Step 3: Analyzing what happens if both players delegate
If we both choose A2 (delegate):
- Mediator plays A0 for both
- We each get 10 points

## Step 4: Checking if delegating is a Nash Equilibrium
If the other player delegates (plays A2), what should I do?

**If I play A0:** The other player gets A1 from mediator → I get 0 points
**If I play A1:** The other player gets A1 from mediator → I get 4 points  
**If I play A2 (delegate):** Both get A0 from mediator → I get 10 points

So if the other player delegates, my best response is to delegate (10 > 4 > 0).

By symmetry of the delegation outcome, if I delegate, the other player's best response is also to delegate:
- If they play A0 while I delegate: I get A1 from mediator → they get 2 points
- If they play A1 while I delegate: I get A1 from mediator → they get 4 points
- If they delegate: Both get A0 from mediator → they get 10 points

## Step 5: Conclusion
Both players delegating is a Nash Equilibrium where:
- Both coordinate on (A0, A0) through the mediator
- Both get 10 points
- Neither player has incentive to deviate

This is the best possible outcome for both players in this game.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the basic payoff matrix (from my perspective as Player 2)

Against Player 1's actions:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 10 from A0, **20 from A1**
- If P1 plays A1: I get 2 from A0, **4 from A1**

In the basic game, **A1 strictly dominates A0** for me (20 > 10 and 4 > 2).

## Step 2: Understand the mediator mechanism

- If only I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me
- If only P1 delegates: Mediator plays A1 for P1  
- If both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both

## Step 3: Calculate expected payoffs

Let q0, q1, q2 be P1's probabilities for A0, A1, and delegate.

**If I play A0:** 10q0 + 2q1 + 2q2 = 8q0 + 2

**If I play A1:** 20q0 + 4q1 + 4q2 = 16q0 + 4  

**If I delegate:**
- When P1 plays A0 or A1 (doesn't delegate): I play A1 via mediator → 20q0 + 4q1
- When P1 delegates: Both play A0 → 10q2
- Total: 20q0 + 4q1 + 10q2 = 16q0 + 4 + 6q2

## Step 4: Compare strategies

- A1 vs A0: A1 gives (16q0 + 4) - (8q0 + 2) = 8q0 + 2 > 0 **always better**
- Delegate vs A1: Delegate gives 6q2 more than A1

**Key insight:** Delegating is at least as good as A1, and strictly better whenever P1 might delegate (q2 > 0).

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning

If both players delegate → both play A0 → (10, 10)  
If both play A1 → (4, 4)

The (delegate, delegate) outcome Pareto dominates (A1, A1): both get 10 instead of 4.

Since the mediator was proposed by Player 2 (me) and approved through voting, it's designed to achieve this cooperative outcome. A rational P1 should also delegate, making delegation my best response.

Even if uncertain about P1's strategy, delegation weakly dominates A1 and strictly dominates A0.

Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Let's go through this step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are Player 1. The game is a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (from Player 1’s perspective) is:

|               | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| **You A0**    | 10               | 0                |
| **You A1**    | 6                | 4                |

This is a variant of a coordination game with an incentive to deviate.

Let’s analyze the best responses:

- If the other player plays A0:
  - You get 10 for A0, 6 for A1 → Best response: A0
- If the other player plays A1:
  - You get 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → Best response: A1

So, if the other player randomizes, you want to match their strategy. We can compute the Nash equilibria:

- Pure strategy NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)
- Mixed strategy: Let’s suppose the other player plays A0 with probability p.

Your expected payoff for:
- A0: 10p + 0(1−p) = 10p
- A1: 6p + 4(1−p) = 6p + 4 − 4p = 2p + 4

Set them equal to find indifference: 10p = 2p + 4 → 8p = 4 → p = 0.5

So, if the other player plays A0 with p = 0.5, you’re indifferent.

So there’s a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both play A0 with 0.5.

But the real question is: **How does delegation change things?**

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator System**

There are **two mediators**:

- **M1 (Player 1’s proposed mediator)**  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

- **M2 (Player 2’s proposed mediator)**  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A0  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

Also:  
- You and the other player **approve** mediators via **approval voting**.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.
- Then, **you decide whether to delegate** (i.e., let the mediator play for you) or **act independently**.
- The key is: **you do not know which mediator will be selected** — you must approve mediators before that is determined.

But **you must submit your approvals now**, **before** the mediator is picked. Then later, you’ll choose whether to delegate or act independently.

So your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff** under the uncertainty of which mediator will win, and your own future decision on delegation.

Also note: You are **Player 1**. The other player is Player 2.

---

### **Step 3: Strategy Overview**

You will later choose to either:
- **Delegate** to the selected mediator (who will play a specific action based on how many players delegate)
- **Act independently** (choose your own action probabilistically)

But the mediator’s behavior **depends on the number of delegates**. So if you delegate, your decision affects **how many players** are delegating, which in turn affects the mediator's action.

Crucially: **You and the other player decide approvals independently**, but **you don’t know the other player’s approval choices**.

So you must anticipate both:
1. Which mediators are likely to win (based on approval distribution)
2. What the other player will do (delegate or not), and whether you will delegate

But you are only choosing **approvals** now. Your future actions (delegate or not) will depend on which mediator wins, and what you expect.

Since the winning mediator is **chosen uniformly at random from the maximally approved mediators**, you want to **approve mediators that help you achieve high expected payoff** under the possible scenarios.

So we must ask: **Which mediators are better for you (Player 1) in terms of enabling good outcomes?**

Let’s analyze both mediators.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Mediator M1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

- If **only one player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **both players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So the mediator **does not play predictably** — it depends on whether delegation is mutual.

This is interesting:  
- If **only you delegate**, then mediator plays A1 → you get the action A1 (but other player may play something else)
- If **only other player delegates**, you play independently, and the mediator plays A1 for them → other player plays A1
- If **both delegate**, mediator plays A0 → both of you get A0
- If **neither** delegates, then both play independently.

So this mediator creates **strategic complementarity** — mutual delegation leads to A0, which is good for both (10 points each). Single delegation leads to A1 for the one who delegates, which may be worse.

But for **you (Player 1)**:

- If you delegate and the other doesn’t → you play A1 → you get:
  - If other plays A0 → you get 6
  - If other plays A1 → you get 4
  → So **expected** payoff depends on their choice.

But you can **choose your own action when you don’t delegate**, but if you delegate, your action is **locked in** by the mediator.

So in the case of delegation, **you cannot choose** — the mediator chooses.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Mediator M2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So **M2 always plays A0** — regardless of how many players delegate.

So once M2 is selected, **anyone who delegates gets A0**.

This is **stable and predictable**.

So if you delegate to M2, you play A0 no matter what.

If the other player delegates, they also play A0.

If neither delegates, both choose independently.

This is **very beneficial to you**, because:
- A0 is a safe action — if the other player plays A0, you get 10 (best possible)
- Even if the other plays A1, you get 0 — but that’s still better than A1 vs A0 where you get only 6.

Wait — actually, if you play A0 and other plays A1, you get 0. But if you play A1 and other plays A0, you get 6.

So A0 isn’t always better. But A0 is better **when the other player plays A0**, and A1 is better when the other plays A1.

But under M2, **if you delegate**, you get **A0 no matter what**. So you're **locked into A0**.

That might be risky if you think the other player will play A1 — you’ll get 0.

But if both delegate, you both get A0 → 10 points each → very good.

So M2 enables a **coordinated A0**, which is the best joint outcome.

But M2 is **proposed by Player 2** — so maybe Player 2 is trying to get you to trust it?

But **your goal is to maximize your own expected payoff**.

---

### **Step 6: Compare Mediators from Your Perspective (Player 1)**

Let’s consider what happens under each mediator, and whether it’s good for you.

#### **Mediator M1 (Player 1’s proposal):**
- 1 delegate → plays A1
- 2 delegates → plays A0

So mutual delegation → A0 (10,10) — great for both.
Single delegation → the delegate plays A1.

So if **only you delegate**, you play A1.
- If other plays A0 → you get 6
- If other plays A1 → you get 4
→ You get at most 6

But if **neither delegates**, you can choose your own strategy. You might play A0 or A1.

But if you delegate **only you**, you get A1 → you get 6 or 4.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and the other doesn’t, you can choose to play A0 — getting 10 if they play A0.

So it's a trade-off.

M1 **encourages mutual delegation**, because then both get A0 (10 points). That’s a **strong incentive to coordinate**.

But if you alone delegate, you’re forced to play A1, which is worse than A0 unless the other plays A1.

But if you play A1, and other plays A0, you only get 6 — worse than 10.

So **M1 is risky** if you're alone in delegation.

#### **Mediator M2 (Player 2’s proposal):**
- Always plays A0, regardless of number of delegates.

So:
- If you delegate → you play A0
- If other delegates → they play A0
- If both delegate → both play A0 → 10 each → perfect coordination
- If only you delegate → you play A0, other plays independently
- If neither delegates → both choose independently

So **M2 allows you to lock in A0**, which is **safe in the sense that you can’t do worse than 0**, but might miss opportunities.

But wait: If you play A0 and other plays A1, you get 0 — but you could have gotten 6 by playing A1.

But if the other player is rational, they might also want to get 10, so they might play A0.

But you cannot predict that.

Key insight: **M2 is more predictable and reliable for enabling coordination.**

But here's the twist: **you are deciding approvals now.**

The **mediator is chosen from the set of approved mediators**, uniformly at random among those with the **most approvals**.

So you want to **approve mediators that will lead to high payoffs** under plausible scenarios.

Let’s think about the **other player**.

The other player is Player 2. They are likely to prefer mediators that **favour A0** or **allow coordination**.

M2 is proposed by Player 2. So **Player 2 will likely approve M2**.

M1 is proposed by **you (Player 1)** — so **you will likely approve M1**.

But do you think the other player will approve M1?

Not necessarily. In fact, M1's behavior depends on the number of delegates:
- If only one delegates (the other player), then M1 plays A1 for them.
- So if **only the other player delegates**, then **they play A1**, and you play independently.

That’s bad for **them** because:
- If you play A0 → they get 20 → good
- If you play A1 → they get 4 → bad

So they get 20 **only if you play A0**

But if they delegate, and you don’t, they play A1 → good for you (if you play A0), bad for them.

So **Player 2 has no incentive to delegate to M1**, because they get:
- If they delegate and you don’t: they play A1 → you play independently
  - If you play A0 → they get 20 → great
  - If you play A1 → they get 4 → bad
- But they **cannot control** your action
- So they might be afraid of getting only 4

So **Player 2 has little incentive to delegate to M1**.

In fact, **if Player 2 sees M1**, they might **prefer to not delegate** to avoid the risk of playing A1.

Moreover, M1 is **your** proposal — so Player 2 might distrust it, thinking you want to force A1 if they delegate.

So likely, **Player 2 will not approve M1**.

But they **will approve M2**, because M2 always plays A0 — **which is safe for them**, regardless of your choice.

- If they delegate → they play A0 → get 10 if you play A0, 0 if you play A1
- If they don’t delegate → they can choose independently

Same as before.

But **M2 is safe** — it never plays A1.

So **Player 2 will likely approve M2**.

Now, **you (Player 1)**: do you want to approve M1?

Let’s compare:

- If you approve M1 and **not** M2:
  - Then only M1 is approved → M1 wins → then you can delegate or not.
  - But **Player 2 likely won’t approve M1**, so only you approve M1 → M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 1 (if you don’t approve) → tie → random selection.

But **M1 is proposed by you**, so you will approve it.

But if you **don’t approve M2**, then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.

But if you **do approve M2**, then:
- M1: 1 approval (yours)
- M2: 1 approval (yours) → tie → winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance M1, 50% chance M2

But **Player 2 will likely approve M2**, so:
- If you **don’t approve M2**: M1: 1, M2: 1 → tie → random winner
- If you **do approve M2**: M1: 1, M2: 2 → M2 wins (since higher approval)

So if you **approve M2**, **M2 will win** (assuming Player 2 approves it, which is likely).

If you **don’t approve M2**, then **M1 and M2 each have 1 approval** → random selection.

But **M2 is always safe** — it plays A0.

**M1 is only useful if both delegate**, leading to A0.

But **if M1 is selected**, you might delegate only if you think it leads to mutual delegation.

But to **get A0** from M1, **both must delegate**.

But if **only you delegate**, M1 plays A1 → you get only 4 or 6 — worse than 10.

So **you will only want to delegate to M1 if you are sure the other player will delegate too**.

But the other player has no incentive to delegate to M1 (as discussed), and might prefer to be independent or delegate to M2.

So **M1 is unreliable** for coordination.

But **M2 is reliable**: it always plays A0.

So if M2 is selected, **you can delegate to get A0 for sure**.

Then, **if you delegate**, you play A0.

Then, **if the other player also delegates**, they play A0 → you both get 10.

If the other player doesn’t delegate, they play independently — but they might play A0.

But you can't control that.

But if you **delegate to M2**, you **secure A0**.

Then your payoff is:
- If other plays A0 → you get 10
- If other plays A1 → you get 0

But you can decide **not to delegate** — in which case you choose your action.

Ah! That’s key.

**You can choose to delegate or not**, after seeing which mediator is selected.

So if M2 is selected:
- You can delegate → play A0
- Or act independently → choose your own action (A0 or A1, or mixture)

Similarly for M1.

So you can adapt.

Now, **if M2 is selected**, you can:
- Delegate → play A0
- Or not delegate → choose independently

Same as before.

But M2 is **predictable**.

You can always **choose to play A0** if you want, by delegating to M2.

But if you play independently, you can **randomize**.

For example, if you play A0 with 0.5, A1 with 0.5, but if you **delegate to M2**, you are forced to play A0.

So delegation **eliminates flexibility**.

But **M2 is safe** in a way: it gives you a way to **commit to A0**.

Is that useful?

Let’s imagine: you might want to **coordinate** on A0.

If you play A0, and the other plays A0 → 10.

But if the other plays A1, you get 0.

But if you play A1, and other plays A0 → you get 6.

But if other plays A1 → you get 4.

So **A0 is only good if the other plays A0**.

But if you **can commit to A0** via delegation, it may **induce the other player to play A0 too**, because they know you won’t deviate.

This is a **commitment device**.

Suppose:
- You delegate to M2 → you play A0
- Other player sees this → knows you play A0 → so they best response is A0 (10 > 0)
- So they play A0 → you get 10

But the other player might also think: “if I don’t delegate, I can play A0, and get 10 as long as they play A0 — but if I delegate, I play A0 anyway”

So **no loss in delegation** — but by delegating, you can **signal commitment**.

But **the other player can observe your action**, not your delegation decision.

Wait: **The delegation decision is made after the mediator is selected, but the mediator’s action is based on how many delegate**.

But **you don’t know the mediator until after approval**, but you do know which one you're choosing.

Actually, from the description:

> You and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game.

> Then, both players decide whether to delegate or act independently.

So:
1. You approve mediators.
2. Based on approvals, one mediator is selected (uniformly from the max-approved).
3. Then both players choose to delegate or not.

And the mediator plays based on **how many players** delegate.

So if M2 is selected, and **you delegate**, you play A0.

The other player sees that you played A0 → knows you delegated → but they don’t know if you could have played A1 otherwise.

But they **know** that **if you delegated**, you must play A0.

So if you delegate to M2, you are **committing** to A0.

This **might** incentivize the other player to also play A0.

But if you don't delegate, you can play A0 or A1.

So **delegation to M2 is a commitment to A0**.

Is that useful?

Suppose you believe the other player is rational and knows your incentives.

Then:
- If you delegate to M2 → you play A0 → other player, seeing this, will play A0 → you get 10
- If you don’t delegate, you play A0 → same result
- But if you delegate, you are **forcing** yourself to A0 — which **might** make the other player more likely to play A0.

But actually, if you play A0 without delegation, they know you’re playing A0 — same information.

So **delegation doesn’t change the action** in M2 case — because M2 always plays A0.

So **the only difference is that if you delegate, you *must* play A0, but if you don’t, you can still play A0**.

So **delegation to M2 is only useful if you want to commit to A0**.

But since M2 plays A0 anyway, **why delegate?**

You could just play A0 independently.

But delegation removes any incentive to play A1.

But in equilibrium, **you can simulate the same outcome**.

So **M2 doesn't add strategic value** in that sense — it just lets you **lock in A0**, but you could do it yourself.

Wait — but **M1 lets you lock in A1** (if only you delegate), or A0 (if both delegate).

But M2 always locks in A0.

So M2 is **more predictable and safer**.

Now, **back to approval**.

You must decide whether to approve M1 and M2.

Let’s suppose:
- You **approve M2** → then M2 has at least 1 approval
- Player 2 likely **approves M2** → so M2 has 2 approvals
- If you **do not approve M1**, M1 has 0
- So M2 wins (2>0) → M2 is selected

Then you can choose to delegate or not.

If you delegate to M2 → you play A0
If you don’t → you play independently

But you can get **at least 6** by playing A0 and A1 appropriately.

But if you **approve M1**, and **do not approve M2**, then M1 has 1 (yours), M2 has 0 → M1 wins

Then you have to decide on delegation.

But if you **approve M1 and M2**, then M2 has 2 (yours + Player 2’s), M1 has 1 → M2 wins again.

So **in all cases**, if you approve M2, and Player 2 approves M2, then M2 will be selected.

But if you **do not approve M2**, then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 0
→ M1 wins

So the only way M1 wins is if **you do not approve M2**

But **M1 is worse for you**, as we'll see.

Let’s compute expected payoff under each scenario.

---

### **Step 7: Evaluate Expected Payoff by Approval Decision**

#### **Case 1: You approve M2**

Then, likely:
- M2 has 2 approvals (yours and Player 2’s)
- M1 has 1 (yours)
→ M2 selected with 100% probability

Now, M2 is selected → you choose: delegate or not.

- If you delegate → you play A0
- If you don’t delegate → you can choose any action

Suppose you play A0 independently → you get:
- 10 if other plays A0
- 0 if other plays A1

But the other player will play independently or delegate.

But if they delegate to M2 → they also play A0.

So if **both delegate**, you both get 10.

If only you delegate, you play A0, other plays independently.

If neither delegates, both choose independently.

So to **maximize your payoff**, what should you do?

Let’s suppose **both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff**.

If M2 is selected:
- You can delegate → play A0
- Or not delegate → choose A0 or A1

Similarly for other player.

What’s the best response?

Suppose the other player is going to **delegate** → they play A0.

Then you get:
- If you delegate → A0 → 10
- If you don’t delegate → you can play A0 → 10
→ Same
So no difference

But if the other player is going to **not delegate**, then they choose independently.

They want to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s suppose you are about to choose.

If you **delegate to M2**, you play A0.

Then other player: if they play A0, they get 10; if A1, they get 4 → so they play A0.

So if you delegate, **they will play A0** → you get 10.

If you **don’t delegate**, you can play A0 → they will play A0 → you get 10.

Same.

If you play A1, you might get less.

So **in all cases, you can get 10** — **if you play A0**.

But if you **delegate**, you are **forced** to A0.

If you **don’t delegate**, you can choose A0.

So no benefit to delegation — but no cost.

But delegation might **induce the other player to play A0**, but we just saw that they will play A0 anyway if you play A0.

So **you can achieve 10** without delegation.

But **if you are unsure**, delegation might help.

But in any case, **you can get 10 points by playing A0**.

So under M2, **expected payoff can be 10** if both coordinate on A0.

Now, is that achievable?

Yes — both players, if rational, will play A0 if they know the other will.

So **(A0, A0)** is a Nash equilibrium.

So **you can expect 10**.

But also, there is a **mixed equilibrium**, but 10 is best possible.

So **under M2, you can get 10**.

#### **Case 2: You do NOT approve M2**

Then:
- M1: 1 (yours)
- M2: 0
→ M1 is selected (only one with approvals)

Now, M1 is selected.

M1’s rules:
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

Now, both players decide whether to delegate.

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Let’s consider possibilities.

**Option A: You delegate, other does not**

- You play A1 (because only one delegate)
- Other plays independently

Now, you have fixed A1.

Other player, seeing that you play A1, will best respond:
- If they play A0: they get 20
- If they play A1: they get 4
→ So they play A0 → you get 0

So you get 0.

**Option B: You do not delegate, other delegates**

- You play independently
- Other player plays A1 (because only one delegate)

You best response:
- A0: get 10
- A1: get 4
→ You play A0 → they get 20

You get 10.

**Option C: Both delegate**

- M1 plays A0 (because 2 delegates)
- You play A0
- Other plays A0

You get 10

**Option D: Neither delegates**

- Both play independently

Then you can play A0 or A1.

Suppose you both are rational — you might end up at (A0,A0) → you get 10
Or (A1,A1) → you get 4
Or mixed.

But (A0,A0) is better.

So you can expect 10.

But now, **from your perspective**, which action is better?

Let’s suppose **you expect the other player to be rational**.

Then:

- If you **delegate**, you play A1 → other plays A0 → you get 0 → **bad**
- If you **do not delegate**, you can play A0 → other player sees you don’t delegate, but not sure what you’ll play.

But if **you don’t delegate**, and the other delegates, you can play A0 → you get 10

But if **both delegate**, you both get A0 → you get 10

But if **you don’t delegate**, the other player might not delegate.

So to **get the good outcome**, you want **both to delegate**, or **you to not delegate and them to not delegate**.

But if you **delegate**, **you get 0** if they don’t delegate.

So **delegation is very risky** — you get 0 if they don’t delegate.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can **play A0** and get 10, unless they play A1.

But if they are rational, they will play A0 if they know you play A0.

So let’s suppose **you do not delegate**, and play A0.

Then other player: if they delegate → they play A1 → they get 20 if you play A0 → good
But if they don’t delegate → they can play A0 → get 10

So **they prefer to not delegate**, because:
- If they delegate → they play A1 → get 20
- If they don’t delegate → they can play A0 → get 10

20 > 10, so **they prefer to delegate**!

So if you do not delegate, and they delegate → they play A1 → you get 0

So if you **don’t delegate**, the other player will **delegate** (to get 20) → you play A0 → they play A1 → you get 0

But if you **delegate**, you play A1 → other player sees you play A1 → they can play A0 → you get 0

So **no matter what you do**, you get 0?

Wait.

Let’s simulate:

- You **do not delegate**: you play A0.
- Other player **delegates**: they play A1 (because only one delegate) → you get 0.
- You **delegate**: you play A1.
- Other player **does not delegate**: they play A0 → you get 0.

But **what if both delegate**? Then you both get A0 → 10.

But **can both delegate**?

Other player wants to delegate only if it benefits them.

If they delegate and you don’t → they play A1 → get 20 → good.

If they delegate and you do → they play A0 → get 10 → worse.

So they **only want to delegate if you don’t**.

But you **don’t want to let them delegate alone**, because then you get 0.

So if **you don't delegate**, they will delegate → you get 0.

If **you delegate**, they will not delegate → they get 20 by not delegating? Wait.

If you delegate and they don’t:
- You play A1
- They play A0 (if rational) → they get 20
- So they **prefer not to delegate** in that case

Wait.

If you delegate → you play A1.

Other player, seeing you play A1, will play A0 to get 20.

So they don’t want to delegate — because if they delegate, they play A1 → get only 4 (since both delegate → M1 plays A0 → if they delegate, they play A0)

Wait — if both delegate, M1 plays A0.

So if you delegate and they delegate → both play A0 → they get 10.

But if you delegate and they don’t delegate → they play A0 → get 20.

So **if you delegate**, they get:
- 10 if they delegate
- 20 if they don’t delegate

→ So they **prefer not to delegate**

But if **they don’t delegate**, and you don’t, then they can play A0 → get 10

But they get only 10.

If they delegate and you don’t, they get 20.

So **if you don’t delegate**, they will delegate → get 20.

If you do delegate, they will not delegate → get 20 (by playing A0)

So in **both cases**, they get 20.

Ah!

- If you **delegate**, they play A0 → get 20
- If you **don’t delegate**, they delegate → play A1 → get 20

So **no matter what you do, they get 20**

And you get:
- If you delegate → you play A1 → they play A0 → you get 0
- If you don’t delegate → they delegate → they play A1 → you play A0 → you get 0

So **in all cases, you get 0**

Unless both delegates.

But if you delegate, they don’t want to delegate (because they get 10 instead of 20)
If you don’t delegate, they do want to delegate (because they get 20) — so they will delegate.

So **one delegate** is the only equilibrium.

So **either**:
- You delegate, they don’t → you get 0
- You don’t, they do → you get 0

Or **both delegate** → you both get 10

But **both delegates** is not a Nash equilibrium:
- If both are delegating, then one can deviate: if you stop delegating, you play A0, they play A0 → you get 10 > 0 — so you want to deviate.

Similarly for them.

So **(both delegate)** is **not stable**.

So **the only stable outcomes** are the ones where only one delegates — and in both cases, **you get 0**

So **in M1**, **you will always get 0**, in any rational equilibrium.

Because the other player has an incentive to be the sole delegate.

So **if M1 is selected, you cannot get more than 0**.

But if M2 is selected, you can get 10.

Therefore, **you should avoid M1**.

And the only way to avoid M1 is to **not approve it**, or to approve M2 so that M2 wins.

But **you can’t avoid M1** — it was proposed by you.

But by **approving M2**, you cause M2 to win (if Player 2 also approves), so you avoid M1.

If you **do not approve M2**, then M1 wins → you get 0.

If you **approve M2**, then likely M2 wins → you can get 10.

So **you should approve M2**.

But what about M1?

You **should not approve M1**, because:
- If you approve it, and don't approve M2, M1 wins → you get 0
- If you approve it and M2, M2 wins anyway → but you only hurt M2 in approval count? No — approving M2 helps it.

But M1 is useless — it leads to 0 payoff.

So **approve M2, not M1**.

But you **must** approve mediators.

Is there any reason to approve M1?

Only if you think you can get mutual delegation.

But as shown, **mutual delegation is not stable in M1**, because each player wants to be the sole delegate.

So no.

Therefore, **you should approve M2, reject M1**.

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

- M1 (Player 1’s proposal): **Do not approve** → you get 0 if selected
- M2 (Player 2’s proposal): **Approve** → enables M2 to win, and you can get 10 points

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.


Instruction:
- Choose a probability distribution over the provided actions each round.
- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

Format requirement:
Return exactly one JSON object, for example:
{"A0": <INT>, "A1": <INT>, ...}

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal strategy for **Player 2**, who is trying to **maximize their own expected points**, with the added twist of a **mediator** and the **option to delegate**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We have a two-player game with payoffs given as (Your points, Other player’s points):

| Your → Other ↓ | A0           | A1           |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**         | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)       |
| **A1**         | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

This is a **simultaneous-move game**, and we're Player 2 (the second row/column), so we need to find the optimal mixed strategy.

Let’s denote:
- Our strategy: play A0 with probability p, A1 with probability (1−p)
- The opponent's strategy: play A0 with probability q, A1 with probability (1−q)

Now, compute expected payoff for us as a function of p and q.

But hold on: we have an **extra action: A2 (Delegate to Mediator)**.

So we now have **three actions**: A0, A1, A2.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the mediator mechanism**

The mediator’s behavior depends on **how many players delegate to it**:

- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0

Note: We are **Player 2**. The other player is Player 1.

So the mediator’s action depends on the **number of players who choose A2**, not which one.

Let’s consider all possible scenarios:

#### Case 1: We do NOT delegate (A0 or A1), and other player also does not delegate
→ Mediator not used, both act independently.

#### Case 2: We delegate (A2), other does not
→ Only **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1** for us

#### Case 3: We do not delegate, other delegates
→ Only **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1** for **them**

#### Case 4: Both delegate (both choose A2)
→ **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0** for **both**

Important: The mediator acts **on behalf of delegating players**. So:

- If we delegate, we get **A1** if only one delegates, **A0** if both delegate.
- If the other player delegates, they get **A1** if only one delegates, **A0** if both delegate.

So, the outcome depends on **whether we delegate and whether the other player delegates**.

Now, we are to choose a **mixed strategy** over A0, A1, A2 — probabilities that sum to 100.

Let:
- p = probability we play A0
- q = probability we play A1
- r = probability we play A2

So p + q + r = 100

We want to maximize our **expected payoff**, assuming the other player (Player 1) also chooses a mixed strategy. But here's a key question: **Do we know the other player’s strategy?**

No. We have to assume they are rational too, and we are playing a **Nash equilibrium** style decision — but since we only care about **our own expected payoff**, and we are trying to **maximize it**, we should choose a strategy that is **optimal in the worst case**, or in **equilibrium**.

But the problem says: “Your objective is to maximize your total points.” It doesn’t specify if we are in a Nash equilibrium or if we can assume the other player is predictable.

Given this is a decision-making game, and we are choosing a **fixed probability distribution** (likely assuming the other player might also use a mixed strategy), but there’s no information about the other player’s strategy. So the **correct way** is to find a **strategy that maximizes our expected payoff against the worst-case or rational opponent**, or ideally, **find a Nash equilibrium**.

But we can do something smarter: **Let’s analyze the game in full**, including delegation.

Let’s model the full game space.

---

### **Step 3: Model the full game with delegation**

Let us denote the **four combinations** of delegation choices:

| Our Action | Other’s Action | Mediator Outcome | Our Action (effective) | Other’s Action (effective) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| A0        | A0             | N/A              | A0                      | A0                         |
| A0        | A1             | N/A              | A0                      | A1                         |
| A0        | A2             | → Only 1 delegates → Mediator plays A1 for other | A0 | A1 |
| A1        | A0             | N/A              | A1                      | A0                         |
| A1        | A1             | N/A              | A1                      | A1                         |
| A1        | A2             | → Only 1 delegates → Mediator plays A1 for other | A1 | A1 |
| A2        | A0             | → Only 1 delegates → Mediator plays A1 for us | A1 (from mediator) | A0 |
| A2        | A1             | → Only 1 delegates → Mediator plays A1 for us | A1 | A1 |
| A2        | A2             | → 2 delegates → Mediator plays A0 for both | A0 | A0 |

Wait — correction: **The mediator acts on behalf of the player who delegates**.

So:

- If **we** choose A2 → we get whatever the mediator plays
- If **other** chooses A2 → they get whatever the mediator plays
- Mediator’s move: 1 delegate → A1; 2 delegates → A0

So final effective actions:

| Our Choice | Other’s Choice | # Delegates | Mediator Acts For Us? | Mediator Action (to us) | Our Action | Opponent’s Action |
|------------|----------------|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| A0         | A0             | 0           | no                     | –                        | A0         | A0                |
| A0         | A1             | 0           | no                     | –                        | A0         | A1                |
| A0         | A2             | 1           | no                     | –                        | A0         | A1 (from mediator)|
| A1         | A0             | 0           | no                     | –                        | A1         | A0                |
| A1         | A1             | 0           | no                     | –                        | A1         | A1                |
| A1         | A2             | 1           | no                     | –                        | A1         | A1 (from mediator)|
| A2         | A0             | 1           | yes                    | A1                       | A1         | A0                |
| A2         | A1             | 1           | yes                    | A1                       | A1         | A1                |
| A2         | A2             | 2           | yes                    | A0                       | A0         | A0                |

Note: When **only one** delegates, mediator plays **A1**. So when only we delegate or only the other delegates, **the delegating player gets A1**.

When **both** delegate, **both get A0**.

Now, let’s recompute the **payoffs** for us in each case.

Let’s define the payoff function.

We want the expected payoff over all 9 combinations (3×3), but since we are choosing a mixed strategy, and the other player does the same, we need to analyze equilibrium.

But here’s a better approach: **Can we find a Nash equilibrium**?

Alternatively: **Is there a dominant strategy?** Maybe not. Let’s instead **simulate best responses**.

But here's a clever idea: **Try to see if delegating is ever beneficial**.

Let’s look at outcomes:

#### Case: We choose A2 (delegate), other chooses A0 → our action: A1 (from mediator), other’s: A0 → we get: 20 points (because A1 vs A0)

From base rules: A1 vs A0 → we get 20

#### Case: We choose A2, other chooses A1 → both actions: A1 → we get 4

#### Case: We choose A2, other chooses A2 → both get A0 → we get 10

Wait: only if both delegate → both get A0 → (10,10)

So if both delegate, we get 10.

Now compare:

| Our Action | Other’s Action | Our Payoff |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| A0         | A0             | 10         |
| A0         | A1             | 2          |
| A0         | A2             | 2          |
| A1         | A0             | 20         |
| A1         | A1             | 4          |
| A1         | A2             | 4          |
| A2         | A0             | 20         |
| A2         | A1             | 4          |
| A2         | A2             | 10         |

So our payoffs for each combination:

- A2 vs A0: 20
- A2 vs A1: 4
- A2 vs A2: 10

Compare to A1 vs A0: 20 → same benefit

But A2 vs A1 gives only 4, while A1 vs A1 gives 4 → same.

But A2 vs A2 gives 10, while A0 vs A0 gives 10 → same.

But A0 vs A2: we get 2 (because A0 vs A1), same as A0 vs A1

So the **only new advantage** of A2 is that when **we delegate and opponent plays A0**, we get **20**, same as A1 vs A0.

But A2 vs A0 gives us 20, same as A1 vs A0.

However, when we delegate and opponent plays A1, we get only 4, which is worse than A0 vs A1 (we get 2), but same as A1 vs A1 (4) — so no worse.

But here’s the key: when we delegate, **we get A1 if only we delegate**, which is good if the opponent plays A0.

But if we don’t delegate, and opponent plays A0, we can play A1 to get 20.

So A2 gives no advantage over A1 if opponent plays A0 — same result.

But A2 is **riskier** if opponent plays A1: we get 4, same as playing A1. But if we play A0 vs A1, we get only 2 — worse.

So delegation *can* be useful when opponent plays A0: we get 20 regardless of what we do (because we get A1 from mediator), but only if opponent does **not** delegate.

But if **we don’t delegate**, we can choose A1 to get 20 when opponent plays A0.

So **why delegate?** The only benefit is if we can somehow coordinate or make the opponent more likely to play A0.

But wait — there’s a **strategic incentive**: if we delegate, and opponent plays A1, we still get 4 (same as A1), but if we play A1, we also get 4 vs A1. So same.

But if opponent plays A0, and we don’t delegate, we can choose A1 to get 20 — but if we delegate, we also get A1 from mediator → 20.

So **delegation gives us the same outcome as playing A1 against A0**, but **only when opponent does not delegate**.

But if opponent delegates, then if we don’t delegate, and opponent plays A2 → they get A1 → so we play A0 vs A1 → we get 2

But if we delegate and opponent delegates, both get A0 → we get 10 → **much better**!

So **if the opponent delegates**, then:
- If we do **not** delegate → we play A0 vs A1 → 2 points
- If we **delegate** → we play A0 vs A0 (since both get A0) → 10 points

So **delegation is better if opponent delegates**.

Similarly, if opponent does **not** delegate, then:
- If we delegate → we get A1 → and opponent plays whatever (A0 or A1)
   - vs A0 → 20
   - vs A1 → 4
- If we don’t delegate:
   - if we play A1 vs A0 → 20
   - if we play A1 vs A1 → 4
   - if we play A0 vs A0 → 10
   - but we can choose

So **delegation is optimal when opponent is predicted to delegate**, because it protects us from getting only 2 points when opponent plays A1.

But if we don't delegate, and opponent plays A1, we can play A1 to get 4, or A0 to get 2.

So if we don't delegate, and opponent plays A1, we can get 4 by playing A1.

But **if we delegate and opponent plays A1, we get 4 anyway**.

So the **gain from delegation is only in the case where opponent delegates**.

Let’s try a **strategic equilibrium idea**.

Suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s suppose both players consider **delegation as a way to coordinate** on A0 when both delegate, which gives 10 to both — better than mutual A1 (4) or A0 vs A1 (2), but still not as good as A1 vs A0.

But is there a **mutual delegation equilibrium**?

Suppose the other player chooses A2 (delegate) with high probability.

Then, if we choose A2, we get A0 (from mediator) → so we play A0.

Opponent plays A0 → we both get 10.

If we instead don’t delegate, say we play A0: we get A0 vs A0 → 10.

Or play A1: A1 vs A0 → we get 20.

So if they delegate, and we don’t delegate, we can **get 20** by playing A1 vs their A0.

So why would we want to delegate? Only if we are afraid of getting 2 if opponent plays A1.

But if they are playing A2, then **they are playing A0**, so we can get 20 by playing A1.

So **we don’t benefit from delegating if the other player is delegating**, because they are forcing A0, so we can **best respond with A1** to get 20.

So if opponent is doing A2 → they get A0 → so we should play A1 → get 20.

But if we delegate, we get A0 → so we get 10 — worse.

So delegation is **bad if opponent delegates**.

Wait — so delegation is bad if opponent delegates (because they play A0, we can do better by playing A1).

And delegation is **only good** if opponent plays A1 — but then both delegates → both get A0 → we get 10, while if we didn't delegate, we could play A1 → get 4 — worse, or A0 → get 2 — worse.

But if they play A1 and we delegate, we get 4 (A1) → same as playing A1.

But if we don’t delegate and they play A1, we can choose A1 → get 4 — same.

So delegation gives no benefit.

But earlier, when they delegate and we don’t, **we get 20 if we play A1**, so we should do that.

So **delegation is only bad if opponent delegates**, because then we can get 20, but if we delegate, we get only 10.

Therefore, **we should NEVER delegate**, because:
- If opponent delegates → they play A0 → we can play A1 → get 20, which is better than delegating (get 10)
- If opponent does not delegate → they play A0 or A1
   - If they play A0 → we can play A1 to get 20 → same as delegating
   - If they play A1 → we can play A1 to get 4 → better than A0 (2), and same as delegating (4 if we delegate and they play A1)

So in all cases, we can **match or beat** what delegation gives us, and in some cases do better.

But wait: if **we delegate and opponent plays A0**, we get 20, same as playing A1.

If **we delegate and opponent plays A1**, we get 4, same as playing A1.

But: if we delegate and opponent plays A0, we *must* get 20 — same as playing A1.

So delegation is **not worse**.

But if we **don’t delegate**, and opponent plays A0, we can choose A1 → 20

If opponent plays A1, we can choose A1 → 4

So we can **replicate the outcomes of delegation** without delegating.

Therefore, **delegation is redundant** — we can achieve the same payoffs with A1 and A0.

Moreover, delegation **forces** us to play A1 when only one delegates, but we can already do that with A1.

The **only difference** is in the **both delegate** case: both get A0.

But if both delegate, outcome is A0 vs A0 → 10

But if both do **not** delegate and both play A0 → 10 — same.

So **delegation doesn't change the payoff** in the both-A0 case.

But here’s the **critical insight**: when **both delegate**, we both get A0 → 10

But if both do **not** delegate, we can still both choose A0 → 10

So same outcome.

But now, **can we use delegation to "commit" to a play**?

No — the only time delegation changes outcome is if **only one delegate**, then the delegator gets A1.

But we can already choose A1 ourselves.

So delegation **doesn't give us any strategic advantage** — it’s equivalent to choosing A1 when you want, but with a different rule.

But wait — suppose both players **prefer** to coordinate on A0 when both delegate — but they don't know what the other will do.

But again, not helpful.

More importantly: **Is there any situation where delegation leads to a better outcome than not delegating?**

Let’s suppose the other player might play A1. Then:
- If we don’t delegate, we can play A1 → get 4, or A0 → get 2
- So we’ll play A1 → get 4
- If we delegate, we get A1 → 4 — same

But if the other player is **delegating**, they are playing A0, so:
- We can play A1 → get 20 — much better than delegating (get 10)

So **we should never delegate** if we think the other player might delegate, because we can do better by responding with A1.

Therefore, **delegation is never beneficial**.

But wait — suppose we **know** the other player is going to play A0.

Then:
- If we play A1 → get 20
- If we delegate → get A1 → 20 — same

But if we **don’t know** their action, then by delegating, we **commit** to A1 (if only one delegates), which might be good.

But we can do that by playing A1.

So delegation is **useless**.

Therefore, the **optimal strategy** is to **never delegate** — set r = 0.

Then we are back to the original game: choose a mixed strategy over A0 and A1.

Let’s solve the original game.

---

### **Step 4: Solve the 2×2 game (without delegation)**

Payoffs for Player 2 (us) vs Player 1:

|          | A0     | A1     |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **A0**   | 10     | 2      |
| **A1**   | 20     | 4      |

Wait — we need to check: is this a coordination or conflicting game?

Let’s look for **Nash equilibria**.

Try **pure strategies**:

- (A0, A0): 10,10. Can Player 1 deviate? If Player 1 plays A1, gets 6 > 10? No — 6 < 10 — so no.
   - Player 2: if plays A1, gets 20 > 10 — so yes, Player 2 wants to deviate.

So (A0,A0) is not Nash.

- (A0,A1): (2,6). Player 2: if plays A1, gets 4 > 2 — so wants to deviate.

- (A1,A0): (20,0). Player 1: if plays A1, gets 4 > 0 — so wants to deviate.

- (A1,A1): (4,4). Player 1: if plays A0, gets 10 > 4 — wants to deviate.

So no pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

Now find **mixed strategy** equilibrium.

Let:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q)
- Player 2 (us) plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)

Player 2’s expected payoff:

E = p * [q*10 + (1−q)*2] + (1−p) * [q*20 + (1−q)*4]

= p*(10q + 2(1−q)) + (1−p)*(20q + 4(1−q))
= p*(10q + 2 − 2q) + (1−p)*(20q + 4 − 4q)
= p*(8q + 2) + (1−p)*(16q + 4)

We want to find p such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1, when Player 1 plays q in equilibrium.

Set expected payoff from A0 equal to A1:

E(A0) = 8q + 2  
E(A1) = 16q + 4

Set equal: 8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → -8q = 2 → q = -0.25? Impossible.

Wait — mistake.

Actually, in **Nash equilibrium**, each player makes the other indifferent.

So let’s assume Player 1 is playing mixed strategy q.

Then Player 2’s payoff from A0: q*10 + (1−q)*2 = 10q + 2 − 2q = 8q + 2  
From A1: q*20 + (1−q)*4 = 20q + 4 − 4q = 16q + 4

For Player 2 to be indifferent, set: 8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → -8q = 2 → q = -0.25 → impossible.

That means Player 2 always prefers A1, since E(A1) = 16q + 4 > 8q + 2 for all q in [0,1]? Let’s check:

For q=0: E(A0)=2, E(A1)=4 → 4>2  
For q=1: E(A0)=10, E(A1)=20 → 20>10  
At q=0.5: E(A0)=4+2=6, E(A1)=8+4=12 → still higher.

So E(A1) > E(A0) for all q → so Player 2 should **always play A1**.

But is that a best response?

Now check Player 1’s best response to Player 2 playing A1.

If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1’s payoff:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4

So prefers A1.

So (A1,A1) is not equilibrium, because Player 1 can deviate to A0 and get 0 → no, 0 < 4 → so no, they are not better off.

Wait: no — if Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets:
- If plays A0: 0 points
- If plays A1: 4 points
→ so wants to play A1.

So if both play A1, no one wants to deviate.

But earlier I said Player 1 would deviate from (A1,A1) to A0 — but in that case, they get 0, which is worse than 4 — so they do **not** want to deviate.

Similarly, Player 2: in (A1,A1), gets 4.

If they deviate to A0, and Player 1 plays A1, they get 2 < 4 → so no.

So **(A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium**!

But earlier I thought Player 1 would want to deviate, but no — from (A1,A1), if Player 1 plays A0, gets 0 — worse than 4.

Yes.

And from (A0,A0): Player 2 wants to deviate to A1 (gets 20 > 10) — so not equilibrium.

So the only **pure strategy Nash equilibrium** is (A1,A1), with payoff (4,4).

But is there another?

What if Player 1 plays A0 with high probability?

But we saw that for Player 2, A1 always gives more than A0.

So Player 2’s **dominant strategy is A1**.

Therefore, **no matter what Player 1 does, Player 2 should play A1**.

So the best response is always A1.

Then, given that Player 2 always plays A1, Player 1’s best response is to play A1 (gets 4) rather than A0 (gets 0).

So **(A1,A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium.

Therefore, **we should always play A1**.

But wait — in this game, **if Player 1 plays A0**, we get 20 by playing A1.

But if Player 1 plays A1, we get 4.

But since Player 2 is rational, and knows that Player 1 will also play A1 (because it's best response), so we should play A1.

But even if Player 1 is not rational, A1 is **dominant**: always better than A0.

So we should **never** play A0.

Thus, probability of A0 = 0.

A1 = 100.

A2 = 0.

But wait — earlier we thought delegation might help, but we concluded it doesn’t.

And since A1 is dominant, we should play A1.

But let’s double-check: is A1 dominant?

Yes: for any action of opponent:
- If opponent plays A0: A1 gives 20, A0 gives 10 → A1 better
- If opponent plays A1: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 → A1 better

So **A1 strictly dominates A0**.

Therefore, **we should never play A0**.

A2? As we saw, A2 gives:
- If opponent plays A0: we get A1 (from mediator) → 20 → same as playing A1
- If opponent plays A1: we get A1 from mediator → 4 → same as playing A1
- If opponent plays A2: we get A0 (if both delegate) → 10, or A1 (if only we delegate) → 4, depending.

But if opponent plays A2, they play A1 (since only one delegate), so:
- If we play A2 → we play A1 → vs their A1 → we get 4
- If we play A1 → we play A1 → vs their A1 → we get 4

So same.

And if opponent plays A2, and we don’t play A2, we can play A1 → get 4.

So A2 gives **no better outcome** than A1 in any case.

And in case opponent plays A2 and we delegate, and they also delegate, we get 10, but that only if both delegate — but then we get 10, while if we play A0, and they play A0, we get 10 — same.

But A1 is strictly better than A0 in all cases.

So A2 is never better than A1.

Therefore, **A1 is the only rational choice**.

So we should play A1 with 100%.

Thus, the probability distribution should be:

- A0: 0
- A1: 100
- A2: 0

Sum: 100

Final answer:

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 100, "A2": 0}
```

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which mediators you should approve as Player 1.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)

We are Player 1 in a symmetric game, with the following payoffs:

| Your Action | Opponent’s Action | Your Points | Opponent’s Points |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0         | A0                | 10          | 10                |
| A0         | A1                | 0           | 20                |
| A1         | A0                | 6           | 2                 |
| A1         | A1                | 4           | 4                 |

This is a classic coordination and incentive conflict game.

- If both choose A0: 10 each → good.
- If you choose A0, opponent chooses A1: you get 0, opponent gets 20 → very bad for you.
- If you choose A1, opponent chooses A0: you get 6, opponent gets 2 → better than 0.
- If both choose A1: 4 each → worse than A0-A0.

So:
- You prefer A0 if opponent plays A0.
- You prefer A1 if opponent plays A1.
- But if opponent picks A1 while you pick A0, you suffer badly.

There’s a **risk** in choosing A0 if the other player might play A1.

Also note: This is not symmetric in incentives. For example:
- Player 1 prefers A0 slightly more when opponent is uncertain.
- But the other player has strong motivation to avoid being exploited.

But since you’re Player 1, and we're deciding on mediators, we need to consider how delegation works.

---

### Step 2: Understanding Delegation Mechanism

You have two options:
- Act independently (choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1).
- Delegate your move to a mediator.

If you delegate, a mediator will play *for* you, based on **how many players have delegated to it**.

Important: The selection of the mediator happens via **approval voting**:
- You and your opponent each approve mediators.
- The winning mediator is chosen **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

You only get to **approve or disapprove** mediators — you cannot directly choose which one wins unless you help it gain popularity.

Now, there are only two proposed mediators:
- **M1**: Proposed by Player 1
- **M2**: Proposed by Player 2

They *both* have identical behavior:

> - If 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

So M1 and M2 are **functionally identical** in behavior.

The difference is that they were proposed by different players — but that doesn't affect their decision rules.

Since they behave the same way, their impact on outcomes will be identical.

---

### Step 3: Analyze How Each Mediator Behaves

Let’s define the possible delegation scenarios:

#### Case 1: No one delegates → everyone plays independently.
→ Then all decisions are made freely.

#### Case 2: One player delegates, the other doesn’t.
→ The mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate).

So the delegating player gets whatever payoff results from the mediator playing A1, and the independent player choosing optimally.

But we must consider: who is delegating? And what do they want?

But recall: **you are the one making approval decisions.**

You don’t control whether you delegate — you can only **approve** mediators. The actual choice to delegate is up to you (and your opponent), possibly influenced by whether a mediator is approved.

But here’s the key point: **The mediator’s action depends only on the number of delegations, not on who is using it.**

And since M1 and M2 behave exactly the same way, their effect on outcome is identical.

Therefore, **from a strategic perspective, M1 and M2 are indistinguishable in terms of outcome.**

---

### Step 4: Should You Approve M1? M2?

You are **Player 1**, and M1 was **proposed by Player 1**. M2 was proposed by Player 2.

But since both have identical behavior and you have no reason to favor one over the other strategically, **your approval decision should be based solely on expected outcome alignment**.

Let’s suppose that **if** a mediator wins (i.e., gets the most approvals), then it will act as described.

But remember: **You do not know whether you’ll delegate or not.** So you must consider your strategy across possible actions.

However, here’s a twist: **You are trying to maximize your own points.**

So ask: what’s the outcome I would prefer?

Let’s think about the **behavior of the mediator**:

- If **only one player** delegates → mediator plays A1.
- If **both** delegate → mediator plays A0.

Now, let’s consider possible scenarios and your incentives.

Suppose you **approve both** mediators. Then, depending on what your opponent does, the winner could be M1 or M2 (random, if both get same approvals). But since they’re identical, the result is the same.

Suppose you **don’t approve one**. Then it can’t win — only the approved ones can win.

So if you approve only one mediator, and the other doesn’t get any approvals, then that one is guaranteed to win (unless opponent approves it too — but only if it’s approved).

But here’s the critical point: **You want to maximize your chance of getting high points.**

Now, **what is better for you?**

Let’s suppose that **after** mediation is resolved (i.e., the selected mediator is fixed), you decide whether to delegate or not.

But actually, the **delegation decision** can depend on the presence of a mediator, and its reputation.

But since the mediator’s behavior depends only on how many delegate, and **both mediators behave identically**, the strategy is symmetric.

So **if the mediator is going to play A1 when one person delegates, and A0 when two do**, what should you do?

Let’s analyze:

#### Scenario 1: You delegate, opponent does not.

- Number of delegations = 1 → mediator plays A1.
- So you get A1 played (from mediator).
- Opponent plays independently.
- What should opponent do?
   - They’ll choose A0 or A1 based on their self-interest.

   But since your A1 is played, and they can see what you do (or know you delegated), but we assume simultaneous choices.

   Wait: **Delegation and final move are simultaneous**?

The problem says:
> "You and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present... then you decide whether to delegate."

But actually, looking again:

> "First, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process..."

Then:

> "If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play..."

So sequence is:
1. Both players approve mediators.
2. Mediator is selected (random among those with max approvals).
3. Then, both decide independently whether to delegate (or act independently).
4. After that, the final action is drawn.

So it's **simultaneous**: you simultaneously decide whether to delegate, and your opponent decides.

But the mediator's rule is based on **how many players delegate**, so you can't know in advance.

Now back to your question: **Which mediators should you approve?**

Key insight: Since M1 and M2 behave identically, **it doesn’t matter which one you approve**, as long as at least one gets approved.

But if you don’t approve one, you risk that the **other one wins** even if it’s less favorable.

But **there is no difference between them**.

So what should you do?

Let’s suppose you **only approve M1**.

Then M2 cannot win — it has zero approvals.

Then M1 wins (assuming you approve it and opponent may approve it or not).

But if opponent rejects M1 and approves M2, then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 1 (from opponent), so max is 1 — and then winner is chosen uniformly at random: 50% chance M1, 50% M2.

Same outcome in either case.

But if you **approve both**, then whoever approves what counts.

But the key is **you want to increase the chance that the mediator behaves in a way that benefits you**, but **the behavior depends on the count of delegations**, not on the mediator ID.

So **no matter which mediator wins**, the behavior is the same.

Thus, **approving both increases your chances of having a mediator that could win**, because it increases the pool.

But wait: Suppose you approve only M1.

Then M2 cannot be selected.

But if opponent also approves only M1, then M1 wins (with 2 approvals), and M2 gets 0.

So M1 is used.

If opponent approves only M2, then both have 1 approval → random draw → 50% chance M1 wins.

But if you approve **both**, then regardless of whom opponent approves, the mediator will be either M1 or M2 with equal probability — but since they behave the same, it doesn’t matter.

So if you approve **only one**, say M1, then the mediator is M1 only if M1 gets ≥ approvals of M2.

But if opponent approves M2 and not M1, then M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → random choice → 50% M1.

But if you approved **both**, and opponent approved only M2, then you still have M1 and M2 both with at least 1 → both reach max approval count (1) → random.

So same outcome.

But if you approve only M1, and opponent approves M1 and M2 → then M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

If you approve both, and opponent approves M1 and M2 → both have 2 → random.

So you are **worse off** if you approve only one, because you reduce the chance of having a tie (which leads to random selection), but you also reduce the ability to “force” your preferred mediator.

Wait — but is one mediator better than the other?

No! They are identical in behavior.

So whether M1 or M2 is selected doesn’t matter.

Thus, **your goal should be to maximize the probability that **a** mediator is selected** (and not none), and since both behave identically, **just getting any mediator to be active** is fine.

But the game requires a mediator to be chosen — so if no mediator gets approval, then **no mediator is selected** — meaning no delegation possible?

But the problem says: "you will have the option to delegate" — implying that **a mediator is present**.

But only if some mediator is approved.

So if you approve **no mediators**, then no mediator wins → but the game likely breaks down.

But the rules imply that **at least one mediator wins**, because the selection is "from those with the maximum number of approvals".

So if **no one approves any mediator**, then all have 0 → max is 0 → and winner is selected uniform from those with max approvals → i.e., all mediators → but if no one approved, maybe the set is empty?

That would be a problem.

To avoid failure, **you should ensure that at least one mediator is approved**.

But you’re playing against another player.

So you might want to **approve both** to **increase the chance that a mediator is selected**, especially if the opponent might not approve anything.

But more importantly: **Even if you approve only one, as long as the opponent approves that one, it can win**.

But there is one consideration: what if the opponent **disapproves M1**, and you approve M1 only → then M1 must compete with M2, but if M2 is approved by opponent only, then both have 1 → random.

But again — same outcome whether you approve one or both.

Here’s the crucial point: **There is no strategic advantage in approving one over the other**, since both behave identically.

Moreover, **by approving both**, you make it **impossible** for **no mediator** to win — because at least one is approved by you.

For example:
- If you approve only M1: opponent might reject both → then M1 has 1, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.
- If you approve neither: then both have 0 → max approvals = 0 → then winner is selected uniformly from all mediators with 0 approvals → both M1 and M2 have 0 → so one wins randomly → still a mediator is selected.

But only if the tie-breaking mechanism includes all mediators with max approvals — even if max is 0.

So **even if you approve nothing**, as long as the set of mediators with max approvals is non-empty (which it is), a mediator is selected.

So **no risk of no mediator**.

Hence, **not approving any mediator doesn't break the game**.

Therefore, the only thing that matters is: **Do you want to influence the outcome**?

But since both mediators behave the same, **any approval pattern will lead to the same effective behavior**.

But here’s a subtle point: **Your decision on whether to delegate** can depend on **who the mediator is**.

But since they behave the same, it won’t matter.

So **you should approve both**, because:

- It ensures you are aligned with as many options as possible.
- It prevents the situation where you approve only one and the opponent approves only the other → then both have 1 → randomization → okay.
- But if you only approve one, and the opponent approves that one too → it wins.
- If you approve both, and opponent approves only one → still, the one they approve has 1, the other has 1 — so both can be chosen randomly.

Either way, the outcome is probabilistic, but **identical**.

But here’s a twist: **What if you care about the possibility of tying?**

Suppose you approve only M1.

Opponent approves only M2.

Then both have 1 approval → random choice → M1 or M2, 50–50.

But if you approve both M1 and M2, and opponent approves only M2, then:
- M1: 1 approval, M2: 1 → max = 1 → both eligible → choose uniformly → again 50–50.

Same.

So no difference.

Therefore, **your approval behavior has no strategic impact on the eventual mediator**, because the mediator's action is **determined by delegation count, not identity**, and **all mediators behave identically**.

Hence, **you can approve both with no downside**.

Could approving only one hurt you?

Only if you care about controlling the mediator — but since both do the same thing, you don’t.

Thus, **best strategy is to approve both** to ensure participation, but also just to be safe.

But is there a reason not to approve one?

Perhaps if you think the opponent might be trying to coordinate with a specific one.

But since behaviors are identical, no benefit.

Moreover, **you are Player 1**, and M1 was proposed by you — but M2 is proposed by Player 2.

Does that cause bias?

Not necessarily — but suppose Player 2 **prefers M2**, and you want to **undermine the likelihood** that M2 wins.

But even if M2 wins, it behaves the same as M1 — so it doesn’t matter.

Therefore, **no rational reason to disapprove M2**.

Similarly, **no reason to disapprove M1**, even though it’s yours — because if you don’t approve it, you risk it not being selected.

But since you are Player 1, and M1 is yours, but you have no control over whether it wins unless you approve it.

But if you disapprove M1, but approve M2, then M1 is out, M2 has your approval.

Then, if opponent approves M2, M2 wins.

If opponent approves M1, then M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → random.

Still, outcome is the same.

But if you approve M1 only, and opponent approves M2 only → both have 1 → random → same outcome.

So again, **your approval choice does not change the outcome probabilities**; all paths lead to either M1 or M2 (same behavior) being used.

Thus, **no strategic reason to disapprove either**.

Therefore, the safest and most rational choice is to **approve both**.

This way, you:
- Do not block any potential mediator.
- Ensure maximum flexibility.
- Have no disadvantage.

Even if you prefer one mediator (e.g., M1, since proposed by you), you shouldn’t disapprove M2 — because:
- It doesn’t hurt you.
- It might help others cooperate.
- But since behavior is identical, it’s irrelevant.

But here’s a deeper thought: **What if the opponent acts strategically?**

Suppose you **only approve M1**.

Then, if the opponent wants M2 to win, they can approve M2.

But even if M2 wins, it plays the same as M1.

So no change.

Alternatively, if you **approve both**, opponent might still try to make M2 win — but again, no difference.

So again, **no difference**.

Thus, **you should approve both**.

---

### Final Decision

You approve both mediators.

Because:
- They behave identically → no difference in outcome.
- Approving both increases robustness and avoids any risk of exclusion.
- No strategic downside to approving either.
- You want to maximize your chance of having a mediator selected, but even with only one approved, it can be selected.

But since both work the same, **approval of both is optimal**.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2)

|           | P1 plays A0 | P1 plays A1 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| I play A0 | I get 10    | I get 2     |
| I play A1 | I get 20    | I get 4     |

**Key observation:** A1 strictly dominates A0 for me (20 > 10 when P1 plays A0, and 4 > 2 when P1 plays A1).

## Step 2: Analyze the baseline game (no mediator)

- I have a dominant strategy: always play A1
- Player 1, anticipating this, best-responds with A1 (4 points vs 0 points)
- **Nash equilibrium outcome: (A1, A1) → both get 4 points**

However, (A0, A0) would give both players 10 points - much better! But there's no way to credibly coordinate on this without a mechanism.

## Step 3: Compare the two mediators

Both M1 and M2 have **identical** rules:
- If 1 player delegates: play A1
- If 2 players delegate: play A0

## Step 4: Analyze outcomes with the mediator

**If both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → (10, 10) ✓

**If only one player delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for that player. The other player best-responds with A1 → (4, 4)

**If neither delegates:** Back to Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

## Step 5: Strategic analysis of the delegation game

From my perspective:
- If P1 delegates, I should delegate (10 > 4) ✓
- If P1 doesn't delegate, I get 4 either way (indifferent)

By symmetry, P1 has similar incentives.

**(Both delegate) is a Nash equilibrium** that yields (10, 10) - significantly better than the baseline (4, 4)!

## Conclusion

Both mediators are:
1. **Functionally identical**
2. **Beneficial** - they enable coordination on the mutually beneficial (10, 10) outcome
3. **Better than the status quo** - 10 points vs 4 points

Since both mediators offer the same improvement and there's no strategic disadvantage to approving both, I should approve both.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:

- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

response:
Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)**

We are Player 1. The payoff matrix for the base game is:

|          | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **You A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **You A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

Let’s analyze this as a standard 2-player simultaneous-move game.

We want to find the Nash equilibrium or best response behavior.

Let’s compute expected payoffs.

Let’s suppose we play A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1-p).  
Let the opponent play A0 with probability q, A1 with (1-q).

But instead of going full game theory, let’s look for dominant strategies.

#### Check for dominant strategies:

- **For Player 1:**
  - If opponent plays A0:
    - A0 gives 10, A1 gives 6 → prefer A0
  - If opponent plays A1:
    - A0 gives 0, A1 gives 4 → prefer A1
  → So no dominant strategy.

- **For Player 2:**
  - If you play A0:
    - A0 gives 10, A1 gives 20 → prefers A1
  - If you play A1:
    - A0 gives 4, A1 gives 4 → indifferent
  → A1 weakly dominates A0 for Player 2.

So Player 2 should play A1 (or mix, but A1 is optimal even if not strictly dominant).

**Best response for Player 1:**
- If Player 2 plays A1 for sure → best response is A1 (4 > 0).
- If Player 2 plays A0 for sure → best response is A0 (10 > 6).

So unless we know what the other player will do, we can’t say.

But **if Player 2 is rational and knows the game**, they will likely play A1 (since it gives at least as much as A0, and strictly better in one case).

So we can **reasonably expect the opponent to play A1**.

Then:
- If we play A0 → get 0
- If we play A1 → get 4

→ So optimal for us: **play A1**, get 4.

But wait — what if we could coordinate?

But we can’t — unless we use a mediator.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the mediator system**

We now have an **approval vote** to pick one mediator from two proposed ones:

- **M1:** Proposed by Player 1
- **M2:** Proposed by Player 2

They are **identical** in behavior:

> - If **1 player** delegates → plays **A1**
> - If **2 players** delegate → plays **A0**

So both mediators behave the same: (1 delegate → A1), (2 delegates → A0)

So their behavior is indistinguishable in effect.

Now, **we are to approve or disapprove each mediator** based on our self-interest (maximizing our own points), **before** we know who else will vote.

Also, **the winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with the maximum approvals**.

That means:
- If we approve both, and others approve both, both have 2 votes → one chosen at random.
- If we approve only one, and others approve that one, it has highest approval → wins.
- If we approve only one, but other votes approve the other, the second one wins.

But since the **two mediators have identical behavior**, the **outcome is the same no matter which one wins**, so **the choice between M1 and M2 is irrelevant to the final game outcome**.

Therefore, we should **approve both** if doing so increases the chance that a mediator is chosen that benefits us.

Wait — but they are identical, so the **expected payoff from either mediator is the same**.

So from our point of view: **approval of either mediator leads to same possible outcomes**.

But we are playing in **our own self-interest**.

We now consider: **under what delegation conditions** do we benefit?

Let’s analyze the **possible delegation scenarios**:

Let’s define:
- You can delegate to a mediator or play independently.
- Your opponent can delegate or play independently.
- But in this phase, **we are only voting about mediators**, not making delegation decisions yet.

So our **approval vote** affects the **set of mediators eligible to be selected**, but not the actual delegation (which happens later).

But we want to **maximize expected payoff**.

Let’s suppose both mediators behave identically → we only care whether **a mediator is present** at all, and how the delegation is assigned.

So, suppose a mediator is selected: then:
- If **only one player** delegates to it → mediator plays A1
- If **both players** delegate → mediator plays A0
- But **what if only one player delegates**, and the other plays independently? That's allowed.

Wait — actually, delegation happens **after** the mediator is selected.

So the game flow is:

1. You and the other player **approve** mediators (in current step).
2. Winner is picked uniformly at random among those with max approvals.
3. Then, **you and the other player separately decide** whether to delegate to the selected mediator (or play independently).
4. The mediator plays based on how many delegations it got (1 or 2).
5. Payoffs are determined.

But **what happens if a player chooses not to delegate?** They play independently — meaning **they choose their own action** (A0 or A1), but now we’re in a 3-choice: play A0, A1, or delegate to mediator.

Wait — actually, the description says:

> "you can also choose to act independently"

So the decision is: **delegate** or **act independently**.

So when a mediator is selected, each player must choose *either*:
- Delegate to the mediator, or
- Act independently (i.e., choose A0 or A1 directly)

So the full possible outcomes depend on:
- Which mediator is selected
- How many players delegate to it
- What actions are played independently (if any)

But since the mediator plays A1 if 1 player delegates, A0 if 2 players delegate, and **only** the mediating player is affected.

Wait — **who is the mediator playing for?** The one who delegated.

But actually, the mediator's action is **used for the delegating players**.

Let’s reread:

> "If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you..."

Ah! So **you are choosing whether to delegate your choice** to the mediator.

So if you delegate, the mediator picks **your** action.

So if **only you** delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get whatever payoff corresponds to being A1.

If **both players delegate** → mediator plays A0 → both players get the payoff for choosing A0.

If **no one delegates** → both play independently.

If **only opponent delegates** → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1 → you play independently.

So possible outcomes depend on who delegates.

But since **mediators are identical**, we only care whether **a mediator is selected**, and **who delegates**.

Now, since the two mediators behave identically, the **only strategic aspect is choosing which mediator to approve**, but since both have same behavior, approving one vs. the other has **no effect on outcome**.

But we want to **maximize our expected points**.

Let’s see: could we **benefit from blocking** a mediator?

Suppose we **disapprove** a mediator. Then it can’t win.

But since both mediators behave the same, **we don’t care which one wins**, only **whether one wins**.

So if **we approve both**, then:
- If at least one other person approves one of them, the mediator may be selected.
- If we disapprove both, then **no mediator is selected**, so only independent play is possible.

So the **only strategic choice** is: **do we want a mediator in the game?**

Let’s compare two cases:
1. **No mediator selected** → both players must play independently.
2. **Mediator selected** → players choose to delegate or not.

We must decide: **Do we want a mediator to be present?**

This depends on **what we can do when the mediator is present**, and what we expect others to do.

But recall: **the mediator is chosen at random from approved mediators with max approval.**

So our approval choice affects the **probability that a mediator is chosen**.

Let’s suppose the other player also votes.

We don’t know how they vote.

But we assume we want to **maximize our expected payoff** over all possibilities.

Let’s analyze the **expected payoff under each scenario**.

---

### **Case 1: No mediator is selected** (e.g., no mediator gets max approval)

Then both players **must** act independently.

From earlier analysis: Rational Player 2 will choose A1 (weakly dominant).

So we expect opponent to play A1.

Then:
- If we play A0 → get 0
- If we play A1 → get 4

So we choose A1 → get **4 points**

So in this case: **we get 4**.

---

### **Case 2: A mediator is selected**

Now we can **delegate or play independently**.

We control our choice, but we don’t know what the opponent will do.

We want to see: **Can we get more than 4 points in the mediated game?**

Let’s examine the possible delegation configurations.

Assume the mediator has been selected.

Let’s denote:
- We (Player 1) choose: delegate (D) or independent (I)
- Opponent choose: D or I

We know the mediator’s action depends on the **number of people who delegate**.

#### Subcase 2.1: Both delegate (D, D)
→ 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0
→ Payoffs: (10, 10) → we get 10

#### Subcase 2.2: We delegate, opponent doesn’t (D, I)
→ 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → we play A1
→ Opponent plays independently → suppose opponent plays A1 (as rational)
→ So we play A1, opponent A1 → (4,4) → we get 4

But is there a reason opponent would play differently?

Opponent is rational: they will choose to play A1 (since it gives at least 4, better than 0 in some cases).

So if they play independently, they will likely play A1 → so we get 4.

But wait — what if they play A0? Not optimal → so we can assume they play A1.

So outcome: we get 4.

#### Subcase 2.3: We don’t delegate, opponent does (I, D)
→ 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1
→ we play independently → we can choose A0 or A1

We want to maximize our payoff.

Opponent plays A1 (by mediation)

So:
- If we play A0: get 0
- If we play A1: get 4

→ so we play A1 → get 4

So again, we get 4.

#### Subcase 2.4: Neither delegate (I, I)
→ No mediator action → both choose independently
→ opponent plays A1 (rational), we play A1 → we get 4

So summary:

| Our choice | Opponent choice | Our payoff |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| D         | D                | 10         |
| D         | I                | 4          |
| I         | D                | 4          |
| I         | I                | 4          |

Only if **both delegate**, we get 10.

Otherwise, we get 4.

So **if both players delegate, we get 10** (best possible).

But is that a good outcome?

Yes — 10 > 4.

So **if both delegate**, we get 10.

But the question is: **can we get both to delegate?**

This depends on the incentives.

- We want to delegate only if that leads to better payoff than not delegating.

But let’s check **our incentive** to delegate.

Suppose the opponent delegates (I, D) → we play independently and get 4.

If we also delegate → now it becomes (D, D) → we both play A0 → we get 10.

So **if opponent delegates, we have incentive to also delegate** → because 10 > 4.

Similarly, if we delegate and opponent doesn’t (D, I) → we get 4.

But if opponent were to **not delegate**, and we do, we still get 4.

But if we **don’t delegate**, and opponent doesn’t delegate → we get 4 anyway.

So if the opponent is **not delegating**, we are indifferent between delegating or not (since both give 4).

But when they **are** delegating, we **gain** by also delegating.

So: **if opponent delegates, we want to delegate** → to get 10 instead of 4.

But what if **we don’t know** what opponent will do?

But from above, **we are better off deposing the mediator only if we believe opponent will not delegate**.

But since the outcome depends on mutual action, **can we coordinate to both delegate?**

Yes — **incentives are aligned in the sense that both players want to both delegate**, because:

- If both delegate → we get 10 → better than 4.

- But what if only one delegates? → we get only 4.

So **both prefer that both delegate**, or that neither delegates? No — both get 4 either way if not both delegate.

But if both delegate → get 10 → better.

So mutual delegation is best.

But is it **mutually beneficial** to delegate?

Let’s check **best response**.

Suppose we believe the opponent will delegate.

Then:
- If we delegate → we get 10
- If we don’t → we get 4
→ So we **prefer to delegate**

Suppose we believe opponent will **not** delegate.

Then:
- If we delegate → we get 4
- If we don’t → we get 4
→ So we are indifferent.

But then, if we are indifferent, we might as well delegate.

But we can’t commit.

However, **in equilibrium**, one could have **both** delegate.

Because:
- If we expect opponent to delegate, we want to too.
- If we delegate, opponent sees that (if we delegate and they don’t), they get 4; if they also delegate, they get 10 → so they also want to delegate.

Thus, **(D, D) is a mutual best response**.

Moreover, it’s the **only** outcome with a payoff above 4.

So **if a mediator is selected**, and **both players delegate**, we get 10.

And **this is a stable outcome**, since both players prefer to delegate if the other does.

But what if **only one delegates**?

Then the one who delegating gets 4, the other gets 4 → same as independent play.

So **no one is worse off**, but both would be better off if **both** delegated.

Thus, **the outcome depends on whether they can coordinate on both delegating**.

But since the mediator is selected **before** delegation, and we’re in a voting phase, **we must design a strategy for approval**.

But the key insight is:

> **If a mediator is selected, and both players delegate, we get 10.**
> **If not, we get only 4.**

So **we want the mediator to be selected** — because **we can then get 10** by coordinating on both delegating.

But **can we guarantee** that both will delegate?

Not perfectly — but we can **encourage** it.

In fact, with the mediator's behavior, **both players have an incentive to delegate if they think the other will**.

And since the **only way to get >4 is to both delegate**, and **both prefer to get 10 over 4**, **it is rational to expect that both will delegate, provided the mediator exists**.

So if a mediator is selected, **we expect both players to delegate**, leading to **10 points for us**.

But if **no mediator** is selected, we get only **4 points**.

Therefore: **we are better off if the mediator is selected**.

So we want to **increase the chance that a mediator is selected**.

Now, how does our **approval decision** affect that?

Let’s suppose:
- We approve both M1 and M2.
- The opponent approves both → both mediators have 2 approvals → max → choose one at random → mediator is selected → we get 10.
- If opponent approves only M1 → M1 has 2 (us + them), M2 has 1 → M1 wins → mediator selected → we get 10.
- If opponent approves only M2 → same → M2 wins → mediator selected → we get 10.
- If opponent approves neither → both mediators have 1 approval (ours only) → max is 1 → so **both M1 and M2 have max approval** → choose one at random → mediator selected → we get 10.

So **if we approve both**, then **no matter what the opponent does**, **a mediator is selected**.

Because even if opponent approves none, we gave both 1 approval → both are tied for max → selected uniformly at random → mediator is selected.

Therefore: **approving both ensures that a mediator is selected, regardless of opponent’s vote**.

Now, what if we **approve only one**, say M1?

Then:
- If opponent approves M1 → M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins → mediator selected.
- If opponent approves M2 → M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → both have max → one chosen at random → mediator selected.
- If opponent approves neither → M1 has 1, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → mediator selected.

So even if we approve only one, **a mediator is always selected**.

Wait — is that true?

Yes:
- M1 has at least 1 (our vote).
- M2 has at most 1 (if opponent votes for it).
- So the maximum approval is at least 1.
- If M1 has 1 and M2 has 0 → M1 wins.
- If M1 has 1 and M2 has 1 → both tied → one chosen at random → mediator selected.
- If M1 has 2 → M1 wins.

So in **all cases**, **some mediator is selected**, **no matter what**.

So **even if we approve only one**, a mediator is selected with **100% probability**.

Similarly, if we approved neither:
- If opponent approved neither → no mediator has any approval → **no mediator can be selected**? But the rule says:
  > "the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

But if **all mediators have 0 approvals**, then **maximum approval is 0**, and all mediators with 0 approvals are tied → one is selected at random.

But is that allowed?

Yes — unless the rules say "at least one approval", but they don’t.

So even if **all approve 0**, then all mediators have 0 → max is 0 → one is chosen at random.

So **even if we approve neither**, **a mediator is selected**.

Wait — but that’s a problem.

Let’s clarify:

> "the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if **all mediators have 0 approvals**, then maximum is 0, and **all** are tied → one is chosen at random.

So **a mediator is always selected**, **regardless of approvals**.

That changes everything.

So:

- **No matter what** we do (approve or disapprove), **a mediator will be selected**, because even if no one approves any, the max approval is 0, and **all are included**, so one is chosen.

Therefore: **a mediator is always selected**.

So the **mediator is not optional** — it **will be there**.

Therefore, we should **not be worried about whether a mediator is selected** — it always is.

So our vote only matters for **which mediator** is selected.

But since **both mediators behave identically**, the choice between M1 and M2 **has no effect on the outcome**.

Therefore, **we should approve both**, because:
- It doesn’t hurt us.
- It gives us equal chance to have our preferred mediator **if the behavior mattered**, but it doesn’t.
- And it ensures that if there’s any chance of a tie, we maximize our chances of being included in the set.

But since both mediators are **identical in behavior**, and a mediator is **always selected**, **our approval choice does not affect the game outcome**.

So we could approve neither, one, or both — **expected payoff is the same**.

But can we get more than 4?

Yes — **if both players delegate**, we get 10.

And since the mediator is selected, and both players have incentive to both delegate (as we showed — mutual best response), we can **expect both to delegate**, so we get 10.

Thus, **in the mediated game, we get 10**.

Whereas in the **no-mediator game**, we get 4.

But the mediator **is always selected**, so **we are always in the mediated game**, so **we are guaranteed to get 10**, **if both delegate**.

And since both players **want to both delegate**, and it’s a dominant strategy in the delegation stage, we can **rationalize** that **both will delegate**.

Therefore, in **any case**, we get **10 points**.

Wait — is that true?

Let’s be careful.

Suppose we **disapprove a mediator**.

But as we saw, **even if we approve neither**, a mediator is selected (at random from those with max approval, and all have 0, so one picked).

So **mediator is always selected**.

So we are **always in the mediated game**.

And in the mediated game, **we can get 10** if both delegate.

And both players **want to delegate if they think the other will**.

So **there is a Nash equilibrium** in the delegation game where **both delegate**, leading to A0 → payoffs (10,10) → both get 10.

Is this **credible**?

Yes — because if you believe the other will delegate, you want to too.

So **(D,D)** is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Moreover, it’s the **only** outcome with 10.

But is there a problem?

Suppose **one player is irrational**.

But we assume both are rational.

So **we can expect that both will delegate**.

Therefore, **expected payoff: 10**

Without mediator: 4

But **mediator is always selected**, so we get 10 in expectation.

Therefore, **we benefit from mediator being selected**, but **it’s always selected**, so **we are guaranteed to get 10**.

But now: **does our approval matter**?

Only for **which mediator is selected**, but since both are identical, **no**.

Therefore, **our approval decision has no effect on outcome**.

But we must approve some or all.

The question is: **what should we do**?

We can choose.

But since both mediators are identical and always selected, **we should approve both** to maximize the set of possible winners — but since it doesn’t matter, and there’s no downside, **approve both**.

But what if we **disapprove one**, but the opponent approves it, and the other one is not approved?

Then the chosen mediator depends on approval counts.

But again, since both have same behavior, **doesn't matter**.

But we are instructed to output a JSON with all mediators.

To be safe, **approve both** — because it doesn’t hurt, and it ensures that our vote doesn't accidentally block a mediator if others approve only one.

But actually, as shown, even if we approve none, a mediator is selected.

So **no risk**.

But **we have no reason not to approve both**.

Therefore, the **best action** is to **approve both**.

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)

The game is a two-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (10,10) | (0,20) |
| **P1: A1**    | (6,2)   | (4,4)  |

We are Player 1.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria in this game.

#### Look for pure strategy equilibria:

- (A0, A0): (10,10)  
  - P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 for A0, 6 for A1 → prefers A0  
  - P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 for A0, 20 for A1 → prefers A1  
  → Not stable

- (A0, A1): (0,20)  
  - P1: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1  
  - P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A1  
  → P1 wants to deviate → not equilibrium

- (A1, A0): (6,2)  
  - P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 for A0, 6 for A1 → prefers A0  
  - P2: if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 2 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1  
  → Both want to deviate → not equilibrium

- (A1, A1): (4,4)  
  - P1: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1  
  - P2: if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 2 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1  
  → No one wants to deviate → **This is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium**

So (A1, A1) is the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

But is it efficient? (4,4) vs (10,10) → (A0,A0) is better for both, but unstable.

So in the base game, rational players might end up at (A1,A1) → payoff 4 each.

However, we are not playing the base game — we have a new **delegation mechanism** with mediators.

---

### Step 2: Understand the delegation mechanism

We can **delegate** our action to a mediator. The mediator is selected via **approval voting**, and the **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

You and the other player **both** approve (or disapprove) mediators. The mediator with the most approvals wins (random tiebreak if multiple tie).

There are **two** proposed mediators:

- **M1 (proposed by Player 1)**  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

- **M2 (proposed by Player 2)**  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **M1 and M2 have identical behavior!**  
They are structurally identical. So **they are functionally the same**.

> Both mediate the same way:
> - 1 delegate → A1
> - 2 delegates → A0

So their output is identical regardless of which one is chosen.

Now, **you are Player 1**, and the other player is Player 2.

You must decide: which mediators do you **approve**?

Let’s analyze what happens **depending on the selection of the mediator**.

But remember: **only the winning mediator (one with most approvals) will be used**, and if multiple tie, it's picked uniformly at random.

---

### Step 3: Strategic considerations — What do you want?

You want to **maximize your own expected points**.

You can:

- Act independently (choose a strategy for your own action)
- Delegate to a mediator (and let the mediator decide based on how many delegate)

But the **mediator is selected via approval voting**.

So your approval affects **which mediator can be selected**.

But both M1 and M2 are **identical in behavior**.

So **you don’t care which one wins**, as long as a mediator is selected.

But: if **no mediator gets any approvals**, or if **no mediator has the most approvals**, then **no mediator is used** — you and the other player must play independently.

That could be bad for you.

Let’s think about **what happens if a mediator is used**.

Suppose a mediator is used (i.e., at least one person approves it and it wins).

Let’s analyze the **possible outcomes** under delegation.

We’ll suppose that the selected mediator plays:

- A1 if **1 player delegates**
- A0 if **2 players delegate**

So the outcome depends on **how many people delegate**.

Let’s consider the possibilities.

#### Case 1: You delegate, Other player does not

→ Only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1

→ Your action: A1
→ Other player’s action: whatever they chose (but since they didn’t delegate, they act independently — but we don’t know their strategy)

Wait — **important**: if you delegate, you **don’t** choose your action. The mediator chooses it.

But if the **other player does not delegate**, they choose their own action (A0 or A1) **based on their strategy**, which we don’t know.

But we must choose **your approval** of mediators **before** knowing the other player’s behavior.

So we must reason about **what might happen**, and what will happen **given that both players are rational**.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoffs.

But note: you are **Player 1**, the other is Player 2.

Let’s think about what happens **in each delegation scenario**.

---

### Step 4: Analyze the potential equilibrium under delegation

Let’s suppose that **mediators are usable**, and you approve some of them.

Because M1 and M2 are identical, **you have no incentive to prefer one over the other**, **except for strategic reasons**.

But both are the same, so it doesn’t matter which wins — same outcome.

So your **approval of a mediator** just increases its chance of being selected.

Now, consider: what **should** happen if a mediator is used?

Let’s suppose both players consider delegating.

Let’s suppose you **approve both M1 and M2**.

Then the other player has to decide whether to approve M1, M2, or both, or neither.

But the **other player** is also rational and wants to maximize **their** payoff.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and try to predict the outcome.

But we’re supposed to make a **decision** on **approval**, assuming the other player will also make a rational decision about **their own approval**.

So let’s model the **approval game**.

---

### Step 5: Model the approval game

Let’s suppose **both players can approve any subset of {M1, M2}**.

We are Player 1.

We decide: should we approve M1? M2?

Key idea: the **winning mediator** is determined by **approval count**.

But since M1 and M2 are **identical**, **approving both is not better than approving just one**, in terms of outcome — **only one mediator wins**.

But approving both increases the chance that **a mediator is selected**, because:

- If you approve both, and the other approves one, then both M1 and M2 have at least 1 vote → tie → winner chosen at random → **mediator is used**
- If you approve one, and the other approves the other, then both have one approval → tie → mediator used
- If you approve one, and the other approves none → you have 1, other has 0 → your med. wins → used
- If both approve no one → no mediator → no delegation → independent play
- If one approves only one, the other approves only the other → both have 1 → tie → mediator used

So **unless both players approve no one**, **a mediator will be used**.

Only in the case where **neither player approves any mediator**, is no mediator used.

So to **avoid the risk** of independent play (where outcome is (A1,A1) and you get 4), you want to **ensure** a mediator is used.

But here’s the twist: **if only one mediator is approved by someone**, it wins.

But **if both mediators are approved by at least one player**, then **a mediator is used**.

The **only way** no mediator is used is if **both players approve neither mediator**.

So your strategy should aim to **avoid that**.

But wait: **you have no control over the other player**, so you need a **robust strategy**.

Let’s suppose **you approve both M1 and M2**.

Then:
- No matter what the other player does, at least you have 2 approvals.
- If the other player approves at least one, then **at least one mediator has 1 or more votes**, and **you have 2**, so **you have strictly more approvals** → **your mediator (M1 or M2) wins** → mediator is used.

- If the other player approves **neither**, then you have 2 approvals → still wins → mediator is used.

So **if you approve both, a mediator is used**, regardless of the other player’s actions.

Now, suppose **you approve only one**, say M1.

Then:
- If the other player approves M2 only → you have 1, they have 1 → tie → **mediator used** (random winner, but same behavior)
- If the other player approves M1 → you have 1, they have 1 → tie → mediator used
- If the other player approves **neither** → you have 1, they have 0 → you win → mediator used
- If the other player approves both → they have 2, you have 1 → they win → mediator used

So again, **in all cases, a mediator is used**.

Wait — **in all cases**, even if you approve only one, as long as **the other player approves at least one**, **a mediator is used**.

And if the other player approves none, you still win.

So **in all cases, when you approve at least one**, **a mediator is used**, regardless of the other player’s actions.

Only if you approve **none** and the other **approves none**, then no mediator.

So:

- If **you approve any mediator**, then **a mediator is used**, regardless of the other player’s behavior — **because even if they approve nothing, you have approval**.

- If **you approve neither**, then:
  - If the other approves neither → no mediator
  - If the other approves one or both → mediator used

So the **only risk of no delegation** is if **you approve nothing** AND the other player approves nothing.

But your **approval** is a **one-sided action**.

So if you approve **at least one**, you **guarantee** that a mediator is used.

If you approve **none**, you **risk** that no mediator is used (if the other player also approves none).

So is it better to approve none?

Only if you believe that **delegation is worse** than independent play.

But we need to evaluate **expected payoff under delegation vs. under independent play**.

---

### Step 6: Compare outcomes under delegation and independent play

#### Independent play outcome (no mediator)

As we saw earlier, the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) → payoff (4,4)

But are there mixed strategies?

Let’s suppose both play mixed strategies.

Let p = P(P1 plays A0), q = P(P2 plays A0)

P1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10q + 0(1-q) = 10q
- A1: 6q + 4(1-q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4

P1 prefers A0 if 10q > 2q + 4 → 8q > 4 → q > 0.5

P1 prefers A1 if q < 0.5

P1 indifferent if q = 0.5

Similarly, P2’s payoff:
- A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2
- A1: 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4

P2 prefers A0 if 8p + 2 > 16p + 4 → -8p > 2 → p < -0.25 → impossible

Wait, 8p + 2 > 16p + 4 → 2 - 4 > 16p - 8p → -2 > 8p → p < -0.25 → never true

So **for all p**, P2 prefers A1.

Because:
- A1 gives 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4
- A0 gives 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2

16p+4 - (8p+2) = 8p + 2 > 0 for all p ≥ 0

So **P2 always prefers A1**, regardless of what P1 does.

So P2 will play A1 with probability 1.

Then P1, knowing P2 plays A1, gets:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4

So P1 prefers A1 → plays A1.

Thus, **the unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies** is (A1, A1) → payoff (4,4)

And since P2 always prefers A1, no mixed strategy can change that.

So **independent play leads to (A1, A1), payoff 4 for you**.

---

### Step 7: Delegation outcome

If a mediator is used, and it uses the rule:

- 1 delegate → plays A1
- 2 delegates → plays A0

So possible outcomes depend on **who delegates**.

Let’s suppose you **approve** at least one mediator → mediator is used → **you delegate to the mediator or not? Wait!**

**Critical point: When you approve a mediator, you are not saying you will delegate to it.**

Approval is **independent** of **whether you delegate**.

You have **three choices**:

1. Approve one or both mediators → mediator may be selected
2. Then, after selection, you can choose: **delegate** or **act independently**

But the problem doesn’t specify that you **must** delegate if you approve.

In fact, **approval is about selection**, not about action.

So you can approve a mediator but **still play independently**.

But that would be **irrational**, because if you don’t want to use the mediator, why approve it?

But in this context, approval is just about **which mediator is active**.

Once a mediator is selected, **you and the other player can choose to delegate or not**.

So the sequence is:

1. You and the other player **approve** mediators (your choice)
2. The winning mediator is selected (uniformly at random from those with max approvals)
3. Then, **each player independently chooses**:
   - Delegate to the mediator
   - Or act independently (choose A0 or A1)

Ah! That’s key.

So **approval is about selecting a mediator**, but **you still have a subsequent choice** about whether to **delegate** or not.

Therefore, **even if you approve a mediator**, you can still choose to **play independently**.

But if you **don’t approve any**, then **no mediator is selected**, so no delegation possible → both must play independently.

So now, the **final choice** is: after a mediator is selected, do you **delegate** or **not**?

And **both players make that decision independently**.

So now we need to **analyze** whether **delegation is beneficial**, and **what you expect the other player to do**.

But now we can **choose** whether to delegate or not, after mediator is selected.

So the **best strategy** is:

1. Approve mediators so that a mediator is selected (to allow delegation)
2. Then, when the time comes, **choose to delegate only if it benefits you**, given the other player’s likely behavior.

Let’s suppose **a mediator is selected**.

Now you decide: delegate or not?

If you delegate, your action is determined by the mediator based on **how many delegates there are**.

Let’s suppose:
- If you delegate and the other does not → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- If you delegate and the other delegates → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
- If neither delegates → both play independently → we know from earlier, outcome is (A1, A1) → you get 4
- If only you don’t delegate → you choose your own action, other delegates → so other plays A1 (if you’re the one not delegating, then 1 delegate → other plays A1)

Let’s suppose **you are considering whether to delegate**, and you know the other player’s behavior.

But the other player is also rational.

So we need to find **a subgame perfect equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose a mediator is selected — now, in this subgame, you and the other player decide whether to delegate.

Let’s find the **best response**.

Let’s suppose **both players are rational** and want to maximize their own payoff.

Suppose you consider: **if I delegate**, what will the outcome be?

It depends on the other player.

So let’s model **your choice**.

Let’s define:

- Let x = P(other player delegates)

But since it’s simultaneous, we need **best response**.

Let’s suppose you are considering whether to delegate.

Case 1: You delegate.

Then:
- If other delegates → 2 delegates → A0 → you get 10, other gets 10 → wait no: you play A0, other plays A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10
- If other does not delegate → 1 delegate → A1 → you play A1 → other plays whatever they choose — but if you delegate → you play A1 → other plays independently

But if only you delegate → you play A1 → other plays independently.

But other’s action: they will play to maximize their payoff.

We know: if you play A1, what should other player do?

Payoff for other player:
- A0: 2 (since you play A1, they play A0 → (A1,A0) → other gets 2)
- A1: 4 (you play A1, they play A1 → (A1,A1) → 4)

So they prefer A1 → they will play A1.

So if you delegate and the other does not → you play A1, other plays A1 → (A1,A1) → you get 4

If you delegate and other delegates → both play A0 → you get 10

If you do **not** delegate → then you choose your own action.

But you know the other player is deciding too.

So let’s suppose you do **not** delegate → then you choose A0 or A1.

Similarly, the other player may delegate or not.

But this is messy. Let’s **find a Nash equilibrium in the delegation subgame**.

Let’s suppose that the **only way** you get more than 4 is if both **delegates** → then you both get 10.

But if only you delegate → you get 4

If only other delegates → you get 4 (if you play A1) → let’s check:

If you do not delegate, other delegates → then only other delegate → so other plays A1

Then you can choose A0 or A1.

- If you play A0 → (A0, A1) → you get 0
- If you play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4

So you will play A1 → get 4

Similarly, if only you delegate → you get 4

If both delegate → both get 10

If neither → both get 4 (from (A1,A1))

So let’s create a table of **your payoff** in the delegation subgame:

| You delegate | Other delegate | Your action | Other's action | Outcome | Your payoff |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Yes          | Yes            | A0          | A0             | (A0,A0) | 10          |
| Yes          | No             | A1          | A1             | (A1,A1) | 4           |
| No           | Yes            | A1          | A1             | (A1,A1) | 4           |
| No           | No             | A1          | A1             | (A1,A1) | 4           |

So your payoff:

- If both delegate → 10
- If only one or none → 4

But **you only want to delegate if the other also does**, otherwise you get only 4 (same as not delegating).

But if you delegate and the other doesn’t → you get 4, same as if you didn’t delegate.

But you get 4 anyway.

But you **don’t lose** by delegating when the other doesn't.

You get 4 in both cases.

But if the other delegates, you get 10 → much better.

So your **incentive to delegate** depends on **what you expect** the other player to do.

But **the other player is rational too**, and faces the same incentives.

So let’s suppose both players are rational.

Let’s see if **both delegate** is a Nash equilibrium.

Suppose both expect that the other will delegate.

Then:
- You delegate → both delegate → you get 10
- You don’t delegate → then if other delegates → they get A1 → you have to choose → if you don’t delegate, you play A1 → (A1,A1) → you get 4 < 10

So **if you don’t delegate**, you get 4

If you delegate, you get 10 → so you prefer to delegate.

Similarly for the other player.

So **if both expect the other to delegate**, then both should delegate → each gets 10.

So **(both delegate)** is a Nash equilibrium.

Is there another equilibrium?

What about **neither delegates**?

If both expect the other not to delegate, then:

- You don’t delegate → others don’t → you play A1 → get 4
- If you delegate → then only you delegate → you get 4 (as above)

So you get 4 either way.

But if you delegate, and other doesn’t, you get 4, same as not delegating.

So you are **indifferent**.

But if you **deviate to delegate**, you get same payoff.

So **no strict incentive to deviate**.

But in this case, you get 4.

But in the both-delegate case, you get 10.

So **both delegate** is a better equilibrium.

But is **both delegate** a **credible** equilibrium?

Yes, because if you believe the other will delegate, you want to delegate too.

But the issue is: **do both players expect each other to delegate?**

That depends on trust.

But here’s the **problem**: **you can only use the mediator if it’s selected.**

But **you can only select it if you approve it.**

And **approval is before** the delegation decision.

So to **enable the beneficial (both delegate)** outcome, you need:

- A mediator to be selected (so delegation is possible)
- Both players to **choose** to delegate

Since you are rational, and you can choose to approve mediators, you want to **increase the chance** that a mediator is selected so that the **better equilibrium** (both delegate) can be played.

Because: **if no mediator is selected**, then **delegation is impossible**, so **only independent play** → (A1,A1) → you get 4.

But if a mediator is selected, then you can play the **both delegate** equilibrium → you get 10.

So you want to **maximize the chance** that a mediator is selected.

Now, since **M1 and M2 are identical**, **approving both doesn't hurt**.

And **approving at least one** ensures that **a mediator is selected** (because you have at least one vote, so you win or tie, but not lose if you approve).

But if you approve **none**, then the other player must approve at least one to have a mediator selected.

But if the other player also approves **none**, then **no mediator**.

So if you approve **none**, there is a risk that **no mediator is selected**, leading to **4 points**.

But if you approve at least one, then **no matter what the other player does, a mediator is selected**, and thus **both can choose to delegate**.

And since you can achieve **10 points** by delegating when the other does, and **4 otherwise**, and **you can coordinate** on the good equilibrium, you should **want** a mediator to be selected.

Therefore, **you should approve at least one mediator**.

But since the mediators are identical, you might as well **approve both**, to be safe — but actually, **approving one is sufficient**.

But is there a downside to approving both?

No — because **both are the same**, and approving both doesn't increase the chance of a mediator being selected **beyond approving one** (since one mediator wins anyway).

But it doesn’t hurt.

But if you approve only one, and the other approves the other, still tie → mediator selected.

So **no downside**.

But what if the **other player** is irrational?

But we assume rational players.

But to **guarantee** that a mediator is selected, you should **approve at least one**.

But you can do better than that: you can **approve both**, and **still have the same effect**.

But there’s no harm.

Now, here’s a subtlety: **what if the other player approves only one, and you approve both** → you have 2, they have 1 → you win → mediator selected.

If you approve only one, and they approve both → they have 2, you have 1 → they win → mediator selected.

So **as long as you approve at least one**, a mediator is selected, **unless the other player approves nothing**, but then you still win.

So **your only risk is if you approve nothing and they also approve nothing** → no mediator.

But if you approve **at least one**, **you ensure** that a mediator is selected.

Therefore, **to maximize your chance of getting 10 points**, you **must** approve at least one.

But you can choose which ones.

Since both M1 and M2 are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But you might want to **approve both** to increase the chance that the mediator wins? No — it doesn’t matter.

Actually, **approving both is not worse**, and **only if you approve at least one does a mediator get selected**.

So you should **approve both** for no cost.

But is there a **strategic reason not to approve one**?

Suppose you approve only one.

Then what? Still, mediator is selected.

But if you approve both, it’s not worse.

So **approve both**.

But the question is: **do you have any reason not to approve a mediator?**

Only if you believe that **if it’s selected**, you might be **forced to do bad things**.

But **you are not** forced. You can **choose** whether to delegate or not.

So you can always **wait and see**.

So if you approve a mediator, and it's selected, you can **decide** whether to delegate.

So you are **not** bound.

Therefore, **approving a mediator only increases your flexibility**.

So **approving both is safe and beneficial**.

Even if the other player doesn’t delegate, you can still **not delegate** and get 4, same as if you didn’t delegate.

But if they do, you can get 10.

So you **gain a potential benefit**.

Thus, you should **approve both mediators**.

---

### ✅ Final Decision

Both mediators are identical, and approving them increases the chance that a mediator is selected (but in fact, approving one is enough), but **approving both does no harm and gives **same benefit**.

Since the mediator is selected based on approvals, and **you don’t care which one wins**, you might as well approve both to ensure maximal inclusiveness.

But actually, even approving one is sufficient.

But why **not** approve both?

No reason.

So we approve both.

But let’s check: **what if we approve only one**?

Then the other player might approve only the other, and still have a mediator selected.

But if **you approve both**, you **still have a mediator selected**.

So **same outcome**.

Therefore, **approving both is safe and optimal**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

This is a two-player simultaneous game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (from Player 1's perspective) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**               | 10,10    | 0,20     |
| **A1**               | 6,2      | 4,4      |

We are Player 1. Our goal is to maximize our expected points.

But now, there's a **twist**: we can choose to **delegate** our move to a mediator (action A2), or play independently (A0 or A1).

---

### **Step 2: Understand the mediator’s behavior**

The mediator is proposed by Player 2 and approved by both players. Its behavior is:

- If **1** player delegates to it → it plays A0.
- If **2** players delegate to it → it plays A0.

So regardless of whether **one** or **both** players delegate, the mediator **will always play A0**.

So if you delegate (A2), the mediator plays A0 — no matter what the other player does.

Important: **You don't get to choose what the mediator does — it's predetermined based on how many delegate.**

So:
- If you delegate, you get the payoff as if **you played A0**, and **the other player plays whatever they choose**.

But the mediator's action is fixed at A0, regardless of how many delegate.

So **whether 1 or 2 players delegate, mediator plays A0**.

Thus, **delegating = effectively playing A0**, **but only if the mediator executes A0 in all cases**.

But note: **the mediator only plays A0** — in both single-delegation and double-delegation cases. So delegation means your action is A0, regardless of the other player.

So **delegation always results in A0 being played on your behalf**.

Thus, **"Delegate to Mediator" (A2)** is functionally equivalent to **playing A0**, **but only if the mediator is willing and able to act on your behalf**.

But here’s the twist: **You may delegate, or not. The mediator only executes if you delegate**.

So we now have three actions:

- A0: play A0 yourself
- A1: play A1 yourself
- A2: delegate to mediator → mediator plays A0

So effectively, choosing A2 is like playing A0, but maybe you get better coordination?

But wait: **the mediator always plays A0**, regardless of how many delegate.

So **no matter what the other player does, if you delegate, your action is A0**.

Thus, **delegation (A2)** leads to the same result as **playing A0**.

Is delegation always better than playing A0?

Not necessarily — but since the outcome is identical, **delegation gives you the same payoff as playing A0**, **but you don't get to choose your action** — but in this case, the mediator chooses A0, which is the same as choosing A0 yourself.

So why would you delegate?

Only if **there is a strategic benefit from coordination** or **if delegation affects the other player’s beliefs or incentives**, or if it **creates a commitment**.

But wait — the game is simultaneous. You don’t signal your strategy.

But here’s the key: **the mediator’s action is fixed**, so **delegation = playing A0**, with no strategic difference — unless the other player knows about the mediator.

But since the game is simultaneous and no communication is allowed, the only thing that matters is your own payoff.

Therefore, **delegation has no strategic advantage over playing A0**, because:
- If you choose A0, you play A0.
- If you choose A2, mediator plays A0 → same outcome.

So A2 is **equivalent** to A0 in terms of action outcome.

But is that true?

Wait — **only if the other player doesn’t know who delegated**.

But since it’s simultaneous and no information is shared, your choice of A2 vs. A0 doesn’t affect the other player’s decision — unless you can influence their beliefs.

But if the other player knows that you might delegate, and they know the mediator plays A0, they can **reason** about your behavior.

But the **strategy** is still simultaneous — you don’t observe the other player’s choice.

So let’s formalize.

Let’s suppose that **delegation leads to A0 with certainty**, so your **effective action** when you choose A2 is A0.

So **from an outcome point of view**, choosing A2 is same as choosing A0.

Therefore, **from a payoff perspective**, playing A0 or A2 gives the same expected payoffs **in every scenario**, because the action taken is A0 in both cases.

Hence, **A2 is indistinguishable from A0 in terms of outcomes**.

But there’s one critical subtlety: **the mediator only acts if you delegate**.

So **if you choose A2**, your action is A0 (via mediator).

If you choose A0, your action is A0.

So outcome-wise, no difference.

So in terms of expected payoff, **A2 and A0 are interchangeable**.

But can we gain anything by using A2?

Only if **the other player behaves differently** depending on whether you are delegating or not — but since they don't observe your choice (simultaneous), they can't react.

So **no, delegation doesn’t change their strategy**.

Therefore, **A2 is a redundant action** — it gives the same outcome as A0.

So **why would we use it**?

Well, unless there is a **signaling or commitment advantage**, but in a **one-shot simultaneous-move game**, **no signaling**.

Therefore, **A2 should be treated as functionally equivalent to A0**, in terms of payoff.

Hence, in terms of **expected payoff**, choosing A2 is the same as choosing A0.

So from a rationality standpoint, **we should only consider A0 and A1**, and choose A2 only if it helps us in equilibrium.

But wait — perhaps there is a **mixed strategy equilibrium** where **delegation helps us commit to playing A0 more reliably**, but since we are already allowed to choose a mixed strategy, **why delegate?**

Let’s analyze the **payoff matrix** more carefully.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Nash Equilibrium of the Base Game (without delegation)**

We can first find the symmetric and asymmetric equilibria.

Payoff matrix (from Player 1’s perspective):

| P1\P2 | A0    | A1    |
|-------|-------|-------|
| A0    | 10    | 0     |
| A1    | 6     | 4     |

Let’s find mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- p = probability Player 1 plays A0
- q = probability Player 2 plays A0

Player 1’s expected payoff:

- If Player 1 plays A0: 10q + 0(1−q) = 10q
- If Player 1 plays A1: 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

For Player 1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1, set them equal:

10q = 2q + 4  
8q = 4  
q = 0.5

So Player 2 must play A0 with probability 0.5.

Similarly, Player 2’s payoffs:
- If Player 2 plays A0: 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- If Player 2 plays A1: 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal for Player 2 to be indifferent:
8p + 2 = 16p + 4  
−8p = 2  
p = −0.25 → impossible

Wait — that suggests **no mixed strategy equilibrium where Player 2 is indifferent**?

But let’s double-check.

We are solving for Player 2’s best response.

Player 2’s expected payoff from:
- A0: 10p + 2(1−p) = 8p + 2
- A1: 20p + 4(1−p) = 16p + 4

Now, compare:
- Is 16p + 4 > 8p + 2?  
  16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → 8p > −2 → always true for p ≥ 0

So **Player 2 always prefers A1 over A0** for all p ∈ [0,1]

Even at p = 0: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 → A1 better

At p = 1: A1 gives 20, A0 gives 10 → A1 better

So **Player 2 always strictly prefers A1**, regardless of Player 1’s strategy.

Thus, **Player 2’s best response is always A1 (pure strategy)**.

Therefore, **in equilibrium, Player 2 plays A1**.

Now, given that Player 2 plays A1, what is Player 1’s best response?

- A0: gets 0
- A1: gets 4

So Player 1 prefers A1 → gets 4 > 0

So **if Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 plays A1**

But earlier we thought of mixed strategies.

But since Player 2 **never wants to play A0**, unless forced.

But is there **any** scenario where Player 2 plays A0?

Only if Player 1 plays A0 with high probability — but even then:

- If Player 1 plays A0 with p=1, Player 2 gets:
  - A0: 10
  - A1: 20 → still prefers A1
- So no matter what, **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2**.

Therefore, **Player 2 will play A1 in any equilibrium**.

Then, given that, **Player 1's best response is A1 (gets 4) vs A0 (gets 0)**.

So **pure NE: (A1, A1)** → both get 4.

But is there another NE?

Could Player 1 play A0 and Player 2 play A0?

That would be (A0, A0): both get 10.

But is it stable?

If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 10 from A0, 20 from A1 → prefers A1 → so not best response.

So (A0, A0) is not a NE.

(A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 20 → Player 1 wants to switch to A1 → not NE.

(A1, A0): Player 1 gets 6, Player 2 gets 2 → Player 2 wants to switch to A1 → not NE.

Only (A1, A1) is a NE: both get 4 → neither wants to deviate.

So **unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**.

So **without delegation**, optimal strategy for Player 1 is to play A1 with probability 1.

Expected payoff: 4.

---

### **Step 4: Introduce delegation (A2)**

Now we have a third option: A2 (delegate to mediator).

But as established:
- If you delegate (A2), mediator plays A0.
- So if you choose A2, you play A0.
- So for Player 1, choosing A2 gives same payoff as choosing A0 — if the other player’s behavior is fixed.

But here’s the key: **Player 2 knows about the mediator**, and may **expect** that players might delegate to it.

But since the game is simultaneous, and no communication, **the choices are made independently**.

So **Player 2 does not know** whether you delegate or not — until after.

But can the **existence of the mediator** affect behavior?

Only if it **creates a commitment device**.

But in this case, **delegation forces you to play A0**.

So if you delegate, you **cannot play A1** — you must play A0.

So by choosing A2, you **commit to A0**, which might be beneficial if it changes Player 2’s behavior.

But we already know: **Player 2 has a strict dominant strategy: play A1**.

Because:
- If you play A0, Player 2 gets 10 (if they play A0) vs 20 (if they play A1) → prefers A1
- If you play A1, Player 2 gets 2 vs 4 → still prefers A1

So regardless of what you do, **Player 2 always gets more from A1**.

Thus, **Player 2 will play A1 no matter what**.

Therefore, **your action doesn’t affect the other player’s strategy**.

Thus, **delegation doesn’t help you change their behavior**.

So, even if you commit to A0 by delegating, Player 2 still plays A1.

Then, your payoff:
- If you play A0: gets 0
- If you play A1: gets 4
- If you delegate (A2): effectively play A0 → get 0

So delegation gives **0**, same as playing A0.

But playing A1 gives **4**, which is better.

So **delegation is strictly worse than A1**.

And **A0 is worse than A1**.

So **best pure strategy is A1**.

But wait — could there be a mixed strategy that involves delegation?

Let’s suppose Player 1 uses a mixed strategy: randomize between A0, A1, A2.

But since:
- A0 → outcome A0
- A2 → outcome A0 (same)

So both A0 and A2 lead to the same outcome: you play A0.

So **A0 and A2 are strategically identical**.

Therefore, **it doesn’t matter whether you choose A0 or A2** — outcome is the same.

But in terms of **you getting 0 vs 4**, A1 is clearly better.

So **any strategy that includes A0 or A2 gives you 0 when the other player plays A1 (which they always do)**.

Only A1 gives you 4.

So **best strategy is to play A1 with 100% probability**.

But is that true?

Wait — what if **delegation changes Player 2’s beliefs?**

But in simultaneous move, **no information is revealed until the end**.

So even if you delegate, Player 2 doesn’t know you delegated — it’s simultaneous.

So **no strategic difference**.

Therefore, **Player 2 still plays A1**, regardless.

So if you play A0 or A2 → you get 0.

If you play A1 → you get 4.

So **only A1 is beneficial**.

Thus, **optimal strategy is to play A1 with 100%**.

But wait — is there any **reason** to delegate?

Only if:
- Delegation makes you play A0 more credibly (e.g., if Player 2 is willing to cooperate only if you commit to A0).

But in this game, **Player 2 has no incentive to play A0** — it's strictly worse for them.

So even if you commit to A0 (by delegating), they still play A1 — because 20 > 10.

So **you cannot get them to play A0**.

Therefore, **delegation gives you 0**, just like playing A0.

So it’s useless.

Thus, **you should never delegate**.

And you should never play A0.

Only play A1.

So your optimal strategy: **A1: 100%**

But wait — is that really the case?

Wait — let's double-check the **payoff matrix** again.

Wait — the **other player's payoff** in row A0, column A1 is **20**, which is **very high for them**, so yes, they **want to play A1** when you play A0.

But when you play A1, they get 4 from A1, 2 from A0 — still prefer A1.

So dominant strategy.

Thus, **player 2 will play A1**.

So your payoff:
- If you play A0: 0
- If you play A1: 4
- If you play A2: 0 (since mediator plays A0)

So **A1 is strictly dominant** for you, even with delegation available.

Thus, **we should play A1 with 100%**.

But let’s consider **if the mediator's behavior changes**.

Wait — the mediator plays A0 **if 1 or 2 players delegate**.

So if both delegates, mediator still plays A0.

So if you delegate, **nothing changes** — you play A0.

But could **both of you delegating** create a better outcome?

Only if the mediator played A1 when both delegate — but it doesn’t.

So **still A0**.

So **no benefit**.

Thus, **delegation is useless**.

So the best strategy is to **play A1 only**.

But wait — is there a **mixed strategy** where you mix A0 and A1?

Suppose you play A1 with high probability.

But since A1 gives 4, and A0 gives 0, **you should never play A0**.

Even if you mixed, you would get lower payoff.

Thus, **pure A1 is optimal**.

But let’s consider: what if you **threaten** to delegate as a way to **commit to A0**?

But **committing to A0 gives you 0** — worse than A1.

So **no incentive** to commit to A0.

So **delegation is never beneficial**.

Therefore, **optimal strategy is to play A1 with 100%**, and never delegate or play A0.

Thus, final probabilities:
- A0: 0
- A1: 100
- A2: 0

Sum = 100 → valid.

But wait — is there any **way** that delegation could lead to better outcomes?

Let’s suppose both players **might delegate**.

But if both delegate, mediator plays A0.

So both play A0 → you get 10.

But **only if both delegate**.

But why would both delegate?

Suppose both prefer 10 over 4.

But **Player 2** has dominant strategy A1 — so **they will never delegate**, because:
- If they delegate, they play A0 → get 10 if you play A0, but get **20** if they play A1.
- So **they prefer A1** — so they will never delegate.

Similarly, you get 10 if both play A0, but you can get 4 by playing A1.

But 4 > 0, and 10 > 4? Yes.

So if you could **coordinate** to get (A0, A0), you get 10 — better than 4.

But **can you achieve that?**

Only if both play A0.

But for **Player 2**, playing A0 gives 10 (if you play A0), but if they play A1, they get 20.

So **they will always prefer A1**.

So **even if you play A0**, they deviate.

Thus, no way to achieve (A0, A0).

Unless you **commit to A0** and **hope** they play A0.

But they won’t — because A1 gives more.

So **no coordination possible**.

Thus, **only equilibrium is (A1, A1)** → payoffs 4.

So **no improvement possible**.

Thus, **A1 is best strategy**.

Therefore, **no reason to delegate or play A0**.

Hence, **play A1 with 100%**.

But here’s a twist: **the mediator only plays A0 when at least one player delegates**.

But **if you delegate, you play A0**.

But if you play A0 (independently), same thing.

So **no difference**.

Thus, **A0 and A2 are identical** in outcome.

So we can combine them — but since they are different actions, we must assign probabilities.

But since **A0 gives the same outcome as A2**, but **A1 is better**, we should assign **0% to A0 and A2**, and **100% to A1**.

But is there **any risk** in delegating?

Only if **the mediator played differently** — but it doesn’t.

So **safe** to say: **never delegate**, **never play A0**.

Thus, final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 100, "A2": 0}

But wait — let’s imagine **you play A2**.

Player 2 sees you played A2 — but no, simultaneous.

So no.

Perhaps **if you know Player 2 is risk-averse or something**, but game theory assumes rational players.

So no.

Thus, **the only rational strategy is A1**.

Final decision.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
Based on the payoff matrix and the rules provided, we can analyze the game from the perspective of Player 2 to find the optimal strategy.

**1. Analyze the Action Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- **(A0, A0):** (10, 10) — Both get 10 points.
- **(A0, A1):** (0, 20) — Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 20.
- **(A1, A0):** (6, 2) — Player 1 gets 6, Player 2 gets 2.
- **(A1, A1):** (4, 4) — Both get 4 points.

**2. Evaluate Action A2 (Delegate):**
The mediator's rules are:
- If 1 player delegates, the mediator plays A0 for them.
- If 2 players delegate, the mediator plays A0 for both.
This means for either player, picking A2 is functionally identical to picking A0.

**3. Identify the Dominant Strategy for Player 2:**
Let’s see how Player 2's payoffs compare for each possible action of Player 1:
- If Player 1 plays A0 (or A2): Player 2 gets 10 from A0, **20 from A1**, or 10 from A2.
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 2 from A0, **4 from A1**, or 2 from A2.

In both cases, A1 provides the highest payoff for Player 2 (20 vs 10, and 4 vs 2). Therefore, **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for Player 2. No matter what Player 1 chooses, Player 2 is always better off choosing A1.

**4. Consider the Mediator and Signaling:**
The mediator was proposed by Player 2 to potentially signal cooperation (A0). However, in a one-shot game or when maximizing individual points, the signal does not change the fact that A1 yields a higher payoff than A0 or A2. Even if Player 1 is convinced to play A0 or delegate (A2) because of the signal, Player 2 maximizes their own score by playing A1 (getting 20 instead of 10). If Player 1 is not convinced and plays A1, Player 2 still fares better with A1 (getting 4 instead of 2).

**Conclusion:**
Since the objective is to maximize your own total points and A1 is the dominant strategy, the rational choice is to play A1 with 100% probability.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

This is a two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0 (Other) | A1 (Other) |
|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                              | 10, 10      | 0, 20       |
| **A1**                              | 6, 2        | 4, 4        |

Player 1 (you) wants to maximize your own points.

Let’s analyze this base game for equilibrium.

#### **Best Responses**
- If other plays A0:
  - You prefer A0 (10) > A1 (6) → best response: A0
- If other plays A1:
  - You prefer A1 (4) > A0 (0) → best response: A1

So no pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists (if you think other plays A0, you play A0; but then they prefer A1 → contradiction). Let's compute the mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let:
- You play A0 with probability `p`
- Other player plays A0 with probability `q`

For your best response:
- Expected payoff from A0: `10q + 0(1−q) = 10q`
- Expected payoff from A1: `6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4`

Set equal for indifference:
> 10q = 2q + 4  
> 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

Similarly, for other player:
- If you play A0 with probability p, their payoffs:
  - A0: 10p + 2(1−p) = 8p + 2
  - A1: 20p + 4(1−p) = 16p + 4

Set equal:
> 8p + 2 = 16p + 4  
> -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → invalid?

Wait, that can't be right. Let's double-check.

Wait — this suggests no symmetric mixed equilibrium? Let's recompute carefully.

For **other player**'s best response:
- If you play A0 with probability `p`, then:
  - Other’s payoff from A0: `10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2`
  - Other’s payoff from A1: `20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4`

Set equal:
> 8p + 2 = 16p + 4  
> -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → impossible

This means the other player **never** plays A0 with probability < 1, because:

- If p = 0 (you always play A1): other gets 2 from A0, 4 from A1 → prefers A1
- If p = 1 (you always play A0): other gets 10 from A0, 20 from A1 → prefers A1
- So **at all p**, A1 gives higher or equal payoff than A0? Let's see:

Compare:
- A1 payoff: 16p + 4
- A0 payoff: 8p + 2

Difference: (16p + 4) − (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 > 0 for p ≥ 0

→ So **A1 dominates A0** for other player!

So other player **will always play A1** in equilibrium.

Then you, knowing this, should best respond:
- If other plays A1:
  - A0 gives 0
  - A1 gives 4 → so you play A1

Thus, **(A1, A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium.

**Expected payoff**: you get 4, other gets 4.

But wait — is that really dominant?

Let’s recheck the payoff matrix from **your perspective (Player 1)**:

| You\Other | A0 | A1 |
|-----------|----|----|
| A0        | 10 | 0  |
| A1        | 6  | 4  |

And **other player (Player 2)**:

| You\Other | A0 | A1 |
|-----------|----|----|
| A0        |10 |20 |
| A1        | 2 | 4 |

Now, for **Player 2** (other player):
- If you play A0: they get 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefer A1
- If you play A1: they get 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A1

→ So **A1 strictly dominates A0** for Player 2 → they will always play A1.

Then you, knowing that, get:
- A0 → 0
- A1 → 4

So you choose A1.

Equilibrium: **(A1, A1)** → payoffs: **(4, 4)**

But is this stable? Yes.

So **in the base game**, without mediation, we reach (A1, A1), you get 4.

Now, we introduce **mediators**.

---

### **Step 2: Mediator Mechanics**

You and the other player **simultaneously decide**:
- Whether to **delegate** to a mediator
- But first, **approval voting** decides which mediator(s) are in play.

You vote on mediators. Winners are those with **maximum number of approvals**. Then one of them is selected **uniformly at random**.

You can approve or disapprove each mediator.

Then, in the **actual game**, you can either:
- Act independently, or
- Delegate to a selected mediator (if you chose to delegate)

But **you only delegate if you are allowed to** — and the mediator must be approved.

But here’s a twist: **Both players must vote**, and the winner is the one with **most approvals**, and if multiple, random.

But you are only concerned about **your approval strategy** — your goal is to **maximize your expected points**.

So you want to **approve mediators** that, when selected, lead to better outcomes for you.

Let’s look at the two proposed mediators.

---

### **Mediator Proposed by Player 1 (M1):**
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

### **Mediator Proposed by Player 2 (M2):**
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **M1 and M2 have identical rules!**

So they are functionally the same.

But they were proposed by different players.

But we are to approve them independently.

Since they do the same thing, your vote depends only on their behavior.

So the mediator’s action depends on how many players delegate to it.

Let’s define:
- Let `D` = number of players who delegate to this mediator → can be 0, 1, or 2
- But only one mediator is selected (random if tied)

But crucially, **if a mediator is not approved, it cannot be selected**.

So the mediator that gets **the most approvals** (and is in the tie-breaker) is used.

Now: You must choose which ones to approve.

But since M1 and M2 do **identical** things, and you are trying to maximize **your own points**, **your approval behavior will be symmetric** toward M1 and M2.

But wait — you are Player 1. The mediators were proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.

But we are not told anything about their preferences — only their design.

So from your perspective, both mediators are **identical in behavior**.

So they behave the same. So if you approve one, it's no different than the other.

But here's a catch: **you are voting**. The outcome depends on **both your vote and the other player's vote**.

But **you don’t know** what the other player will do.

So you must do **best response** under uncertainty.

Your goal: **maximize your expected payoff**, considering that:
- You can vote for M1 and/or M2
- Then a mediator is selected at random from those with the max approvals
- Then both players independently choose: act or delegate
- Then the mediator (if used) plays a move depending on how many delegated to it
- Then payoff is realized

But the game has a **sequential choice structure**:
1. Approval voting
2. Then, given approved mediators, the winning mediator is selected (random if tie)
3. Then, both players simultaneously choose: delegate or not (i.e., act independently)
4. Then mediator plays based on number of delegates
5. Payoff is computed

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Implications of Approving/Not Approving**

Because M1 and M2 are identical in function, approving both or only one makes no difference **in terms of behavior**.

But there’s a twist: **If you approve only one, and they both get same approvals, then the other player can control the selection**.

But since you don’t know what the other player will do, we need to reason strategically.

Let’s suppose you are considering your approval.

Let’s try different scenarios.

But first: **what happens if a mediator is selected?** Then:
- If 0 delegates → no action? But mediator is selected only if at least one delegates?
- But the mediator rules depend on **how many players delegate to it**

So even if a mediator is selected, it may not be used if **no one delegates**.

But players can choose to delegate or not.

So suppose a mediator M is selected.

Then each player decides whether to delegate or not.

Let:
- Let `k` = number of players who delegate to M → k = 0, 1, or 2
- Then M plays:
  - k=1 → A1
  - k=2 → A0

(Both mediators do this.)

So if you delegate to M, and the other player does not → k=1 → M plays A1
→ you get the payoff where you played A1 and other played what they did.

Wait — no: if you delegate, **M plays for you**.

So **your action is decided by M**, not by you.

Your action is whatever **M plays**.

The other player can choose to act independently or to delegate.

So **only if you delegate**, your action is set by M.

If you act independently, you choose your own action.

Similarly for other player.

So the game has two layers:
1. Approval voting → chooses which mediator is active (from approved ones)
2. Delegation decision → for each player, choose “delegate to mediator” or “act independently”
3. If a player delegates, their action is determined by the active mediator, based on how many delegates (1 or 2)

So let’s denote:

Let M be the **selected mediator** (from approved ones).

Then, each player chooses:
- Delegate (D) or act independently (I)

Then:
- If you delegate → your action = M’s action (based on number of delegates to M)
- If the other player delegates → their action = M’s action
- If not, they play their own action (which you decide in strategy)

But here’s the key: when you choose to act independently, **you can pick your action strategically**.

So you can choose to play A0 or A1 based on the situation.

Thus, **your strategy space is more flexible**.

But now: **the mediator's behavior is fixed based on count**.

Let’s denote:
- Let `k` = total number of players who delegate to M
- Then:
  - If k=1 → M plays A1
  - If k=2 → M plays A0

But note: if k=0 → no delegate → mediator doesn’t play? But the mediator is supposed to be used only if someone delegates?

But the rule says: "if 1 player(s) delegate... if 2..."

It doesn't say what happens if zero delegate. But obviously, if no one delegates, then the mediator isn't used. So players play independently.

But the rule doesn't specify what to do if no one delegates — we can assume in that case, the mediator is not invoked, so each player plays independently.

So, **only if you delegate, you are bound by the mediator’s action**.

Otherwise, you play your own.

Now, your goal: **maximize your expected points**, in a game where you:
- Vote: approve M1, M2, or not
- Then, based on approval and other player's vote, a mediator is selected
- Then, both of you choose to delegate or not (simultaneously)
- Then payoffs are computed

You must **reason about equilibrium behavior** after approval, but since you are deciding approval first, and don’t know others’ moves, you need to use **backward induction**.

But it's complex.

Let’s simplify.

Let’s suppose you **approve both M1 and M2**.

Then the selected mediator is M1 or M2 chosen uniformly at random → but since they are identical, it doesn’t matter. So we can treat them as one.

So if you approve both, the mediator is selected at random from {M1, M2}, but both behave identically, so the behavior is the same.

So approval of both is equivalent to approval of just one, **in terms of behavior**.

But if you **approve only one**, say M1, and the other player approves only M2, then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 1 approval
- So both tied → selected uniformly at random → each has 50% chance → but same behavior.

Again, doesn’t matter.

But if you approve only M1, and other player approves only M1 → M1 wins (2 approvals), M2 loses.

Similarly, if you approve both, and other approves both → both have 2 approvals → random selection.

But since both mediators behave the same, **the actual selected mediator doesn’t matter** — behavior is identical.

So **your approval decision only affects the probability that there is a mediator that can be used**, and the “incentives” for delegation.

But crucially, **if a mediator is not approved, it can’t be selected**.

So, **if you disapprove both**, then no mediator is selected → so the game reverts to base game: both players act independently.

In base game, equilibrium is (A1, A1) → you get 4.

But in that case, you can potentially do better with mediation.

So you might want to **approve at least one**.

But suppose you **approve both** — that’s fine.

Suppose you approve only one — same thing.

But here's a key: **both mediators are identical**, so approval of one or both doesn't change the set of possible behaviors.

But approval of **at least one** means that a mediator (with fixed behavior) may be used.

The other player also votes.

So you must consider what the other player will do.

But you don’t know.

So assume rational players.

But you are only concerned with **your own expected payoff**.

Let’s analyze:

Suppose you **approve both mediators**.

Then, no matter what the other player does, at least one mediator is approved (since you approved both), so the winning mediator is whichever has max approvals.

- If other player approves both: both have 2 approvals → both win with 50% chance → but same behavior
- If other approves one: that one has 2 approvals, the other has 1 → so that one wins
- If other approves none: your two approvals are max → so one of them wins

So **if you approve both, a mediator is always selected**.

So the game always has a mediator available.

If you approve only one (say M1), and other player approves both: then M1 has 1, M2 has 2 → M2 wins → mediator is M2 → behavior is the same.

If other approves only M1: then both have 1 → tied → random winner → same behavior.

If other approves none: M1 wins.

So in **all cases**, if **you approve at least one**, and the other player approves at least one, or even if not, **a mediator is selected**.

But if you approve **none**, then:
- Only if other player approves at least one, but if both approve none → no mediator → base game.

But if you approve none, and other approves one or both, then the mediator is selected, since it has more approvals.

So only if both approve none → no mediator.

So, if you approve **none**, then:
- If other approves at least one → mediator is selected (the one with max approvals)
- If other approves none → no mediator → base game

But you don’t know what other player does.

So to maximize expected payoff, you want to **maximize the chance that a mediator is used**, because the base game gives you only 4.

Can you get more than 4 with mediation?

Let’s see.

Suppose a mediator is selected (say M).

Now, both players simultaneously decide to delegate or not.

Then, based on number of delegates (k), M plays:
- k=1 → A1
- k=2 → A0

Then, your action is:
- If you delegate → action = M’s action
- If you act independently → you can choose A0 or A1

Same for other player.

So you can **choose your action optimally** depending on the situation.

Let’s consider possible outcomes.

You want to **maximize your payoff**, so you will choose your own action carefully.

Let’s suppose the mediator is selected.

Let’s analyze possible delegation outcomes and your choice.

We’ll consider cases based on how many players delegate.

Let `k` = number of players who delegate to the mediator.

Then:
- If k = 1 → M plays A1
- If k = 2 → M plays A0

Case 1: k=0 → no one delegates → both play independently → equilibrium is both play A1 → you get 4

Case 2: k=1 → M plays A1

So **the delegate’s action is A1**

Now, the other player:
- If they delegate → they play A1
- If they act independently → they can choose

Similarly for you.

But suppose you are the one who delegates → then you play A1

The other player:
- If they delegate → they play A1
- If they act → they can choose action

But you don’t know what the other player will do.

But you are rational, so you can compute best responses.

Let’s suppose you **delegate** → so you play A1

Then other player:
- If they act independently, they will choose best response to A1 (your action).
- Since you play A1, other player’s payoffs:
  - If they play A0: get 2
  - If they play A1: get 4
  → so they choose A1

So if you delegate, and they act independently → you both play A1 → payoff: you get 4

But you are playing A1, and they play A1.

Yes.

But if **you delegate**, and they **also delegate** → then k=2 → M plays A0

So **you play A0**, they play A0

Then payoff: you get 10, other gets 10

That’s better for you.

So if you delegate, and other also delegates → you get 10

If you delegate, and other acts independently → you get 4

So your payoff depends on other's choice.

Similarly, suppose **you do not delegate** → you can choose your own action.

Then the other player may delegate or not.

Let’s suppose you do not delegate → you choose your own action.

Let’s try to find **equilibrium** when a mediator is selected.

But we can try to **maximize your payoff** via your actions.

Let’s suppose the mediator is selected, and you consider whether to delegate.

Let’s suppose **you delegate** → so your action is determined by k.

But k depends on whether both delegate.

So let’s suppose you **delegate**, and you assume the other player is also rational.

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, but you don’t control the other player.

But in equilibrium, both choose simultaneously.

Let’s analyze possible **equilibrium delegation strategies**.

But note: your strategy space is richer: you can choose to delegate or not, and if not, choose your action.

So you can **condition**.

Let’s suppose **you decide to delegate**.

Then your action depends on k.

Case A: you delegate, other delegates → k=2 → M plays A0 → you play A0 → other plays A0 → payoff: you get 10

Case B: you delegate, other acts → k=1 → M plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays their own action.

Since you play A1, other’s best response is A1 (since 4 > 2) → so both play A1 → you get 4

So if you delegate:
- If other delegates → you get 10
- If other acts → you get 4

So your payoff depends on other’s choice.

Now, suppose **you act independently** → you can choose A0 or A1.

Suppose you choose A0.

Then the other player:
- If they delegate → they play A1 (since k=1, M plays A1) → you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0
- If they act → they can choose: A0 → 10, A1 → 0 → so they choose A0 → you get 10

So if you play A0:
- If other delegates → you get 0
- If other acts → you get 10

Suppose you play A1:
- If other delegates → they play A1 → you play A1 → you get 4
- If other acts → they play A1 → you get 4

So if you play A1, you always get 4, regardless of what the other does.

If you play A0, you get 0 if other delegates, 10 if they act.

So the only case where you get 10 is if:
- You play A0 and other acts (plays A0)
- Or you delegate and other delegates (both play A0)

But you cannot control other's action.

So let’s consider your **best response**.

Suppose you **delegate**.
- Then you are forced to play A0 if k=2, A1 if k=1
- And you don't know what k is, but you know it depends on other’s choice

Suppose the other player is rational and also wants to maximize own payoff.

Now, let’s suppose **the mediator is selected**.

What is the **equilibrium** of the delegation game?

Let’s suppose both players are rational.

Let’s consider strategies.

Suppose you **do not delegate** → you can choose action.

Let’s consider: **can you get more than 4?**

Yes, if you can get (A0, A0), you get 10.

So you want to get (A0, A0).

But if you play A0, and other plays A1 → you get 0.

So only if other plays A0, you get 10.

So to get 10, you need other to play A0.

But if you play A0, other’s best response is A0 (they get 10) vs A1 (0) → so they play A0.

So if you play A0, other plays A0 → you get 10.

But if you play A1, you get 4.

So **if you are not delegating**, you should play A0 → then you get 10.

Because other will play A0 in response.

So if you act independently, **you will choose A0** → then other will choose A0 → you get 10.

But wait: is that correct?

Yes: because if you play A0, other gets:
- A0 → 10
- A1 → 20 → wait no!

Wait — **this is critical.**

From **other player’s perspective**:

If you play A0, they get:
- If they play A0: 10
- If they play A1: 20

→ So they **prefer A1**!

They get 20 for A1.

So if you play A0, other will play A1 → you get 0.

Then, if you play A1, they get:
- A0 → 2
- A1 → 4 → prefer A1 → so they play A1 → you get 4

So no matter what you play:
- If you play A0 → they play A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 → they play A1 → you get 4

So **if you act independently**, you cannot avoid getting 4 — the other player will always prefer A1.

So **best response** is to play A1 → you get 4.

So if you do **not delegate**, your best action is A1 → and other will respond with A1 → you get 4.

Now, suppose you **delegate**.

Then your action is set by the mediator.

M plays A1 if k=1 (only one delegate), A0 if k=2 (two delegates).

Now, suppose you delegate.

Then:

Case 1: you delegate, other acts → k=1 → M plays A1 → you play A1

Then other, facing A1 (you), will play A1 → payoffs: (A1, A1) → you get 4

Case 2: you delegate, other also delegates → k=2 → M plays A0 → you play A0

Then other plays A0 (since you play A0)

Then payoff: you get 10

So if you delegate:
- If other acts → you get 4
- If other delegates → you get 10

Now, what should the other player do?

Suppose the other player is considering delegation.

If they delegate:
- Then k=2 → M plays A0 → so they play A0
- Then you play A0 (if you delegate) → they play A0 → payoff 10

If they act:
- Then k=1 → M plays A1 → you play A1 (if you delegate) → and they face A1 → so they choose A1 → get 4

So if they delegate, they get 10 (if you delegate)
If they act, they get 4

So they prefer to delegate.

But if you do not delegate?

But let’s suppose you delegate.

Then other player:
- If they delegate → k=2 → M plays A0 → they play A0 → you play A0 → they get 10
- If they act → k=1 → M plays A1 → you play A1 → they face A1 → best response: A1 → get 4
→ So they prefer to delegate.

So if **you delegate**, the other player will **also delegate** → because they get 10 > 4.

Then k=2 → M plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 10

So if you delegate, and other acts, you get 4; but if other delegates, you get 10.

But since other will delegate when you do, you get 10.

But what if you **do not delegate**?

Then, as above, you get 4 at best.

So you should **delegate**, because it leads to (A0, A0) and 10 points.

But only if the other player also delegates.

But in this case, **they will**, because they get 10 > 4.

So **if you delegate, the other player will delegate, k=2, M plays A0, you get 10**

But is that the only equilibrium?

What if you **do not delegate**?

Then, you play A1 (best response), other faces A1, they play A1 → you get 4

But if you **deviate and delegate**, you get 10 — better!

So **not delegating is not equilibrium**, because you can get 10 by delegating.

So only **equilibrium** is:
- You delegate
- Other delegates
- k=2 → M plays A0
- Both play A0
- You get 10

Yes!

So with a mediator selected, and you both delegate, you get 10.

But is there a threat?

Suppose you are not sure whether the other will delegate.

But since it’s a simultaneous choice, and rational, they will delegate if you delegate.

But can there be a "do not delegate" equilibrium?

Suppose both do not delegate → then both play independently → then both play A1 → you get 4

But if you deviate and delegate, and they don’t delegate, then k=1 → M plays A1 → you play A1 → they play A1 → you get 4 — no change.

But if **you delegate and they do not**, you get 4 (same as before).

But if they **do** delegate, you get 10.

But if you don't delegate, and they do, you get 0 (if you play A0) or 4 (if play A1)

But if you don't delegate, you can play A1 → get 4

If you delegate and they don't → you get 4

So same.

But if they do delegate, you get 10 if you delegate, 4 if not.

So you prefer to delegate.

Other player thinks the same: if you delegate, they get 10 (by delegating) vs 4 (by acting)

So they prefer to delegate.

So **the only stable equilibrium is both delegate, k=2, M plays A0, you get 10**

But is there a risk of "do not delegate"?

Suppose both are afraid: "what if the other doesn't delegate?" → then you get 4 instead of 10.

But in that case, if you delegate and they don't, you get 4 — same as not delegating.

But if you both delegate, you get 10.

So there’s a **coordination game**: both delegate is better.

And since both have incentive to delegate, and it's symmetric, both will likely delegate.

So **expected payoff with mediator: 10**

But is it guaranteed? Yes, in equilibrium.

But if players are risk-averse, they might not delegate.

But assuming rational, self-interested, and symmetric, they will coordinate on the high payoff.

So **you can expect to get 10 if a mediator is selected**.

Now, in base game (no mediator), you get 4.

So **you prefer a mediator to be selected**.

But only if the mediator is approved.

Now, the **only way for no mediator to be selected** is if **no one approves any**.

But if you **approve at least one**, then even if other approves none, your approval ensures at least one mediator gets approvals.

For example:
- If you approve M1, and other approves nothing → M1 has 1 approval → wins → mediator is used → you can get 10
- If you approve nothing, and other approves nothing → no mediator → you get 4
- If you approve nothing, but other approves one → that one wins → mediator used → you can get 10

But if you approve nothing, you are **risking** that other approves nothing → then you get 4.

Whereas if you approve at least one, **you guarantee** that a mediator is used (because even if other approves nothing, you have one).

But the other player might approve mediators too.

But from your perspective, if you approve at least one mediator, then **the mediator will be used** (since you have at least one approval).

Only in the case where **both you and other approve no one** → no mediator.

But since you are trying to **maximize expected payoff**, and the only downside is getting 4 instead of 10, you **should never disapprove both**.

Because:
- If you approve at least one → mediator is used → you get 10 in equilibrium
- If you approve none → chance that other approves none → you get 4; chance other approves one → you get 10

But you don’t know.

But even if other is rational, you can’t be sure.

But **if you approve at least one**, **you force a mediator to be used**, regardless of other player.

So you **guarantee** at least one mediator is available.

But if you approve none, then:
- If other approves at least one → mediator used → you get 10
- If other approves none → no mediator → you get 4

So your expected payoff depends on other player’s approval.

But **you don’t know** what they do.

But to **maximize your expected payoff**, you should **minimize the chance of getting 4**.

By approving at least one, you **ensure** that a mediator is used (even if other approves nothing), so you **guarantee** 10.

By approving none, you **risk** getting 4 if other also approves none.

Since you want to maximize, and you can **guarantee 10** by approving at least one, while risking 4 if you approve none, you should **approve at least one**.

Moreover, since M1 and M2 are identical, it doesn't matter which one.

So you should approve **both**, because they are the same.

But even approving one is sufficient.

But since you can, and no downside, **approve both**.

Is there any downside to approving both?

No. Because:
- They behave the same
- You can still use one
- You can’t do worse by approving both

In fact, if you approve only one, say M1, and other player approves only M2, then:
- M1: 1, M2: 1 → tied → random selection → same behavior

Same as if both approved both.

So no difference.

But if you approve both, and other approves both, then both have 2 approvals → tied → random choice → fine.

No issue.

So **approving both is fine**.

And it ensures that even if other player approves only one, you still have one.

But since behavior is same, no harm.

So your optimal strategy: **approve both**.

Because you can guarantee that a mediator is selected, and in that case, you can get 10.

Whereas if you approve none, you might get only 4.

So to maximize minimum payoff, or expected payoff, you should approve both.

Final decision: approve both M1 and M2.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

Let's solve this step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without Mediators**

We are Player 1 in a simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 10           | 10                     |
| A0          | A1                     | 0            | 20                     |
| A1          | A0                     | 6            | 2                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 4            | 4                      |

This is a coordination game with an incentive to match the other player’s action, but with asymmetric payoffs.

Let’s analyze the best responses:

- If other player plays A0:
  - You get 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefer A0
- If other player plays A1:
  - You get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A1

So your **best response** is to match the other player’s action. But the other player will do the same. So we have two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 10
- (A1, A1): both get 4

But (A0, A0) is better for both. However, there’s a risk: if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0 — very bad.

So there's a **coordination incentive** to both play A0.

But since the other player is unknown (and possibly rational), this becomes a game of strategy.

Now, **we are allowed to delegate to a mediator** — but **first**, we go through an **approval voting process** to decide which mediator(s) can be in the game. The **winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum approvals**.

We are to **approve or disapprove** of each mediator, which affects whether it can win (if it gets enough votes).

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediators**

We are evaluating two proposed mediators.

Note: The vote is *for* or *against* a mediator — but **the winning mediator is selected only among those approved by at least one player (presumably)**, but since **we are only deciding our own approvals**, and the final winner is uniformly random among those with the **maximum approvals**, we want to **strategically approve mediators** to increase our chances of getting a mediator that benefits us.

Let’s examine each mediator.

---

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):**
> - If **1 player** delegates to it → plays A1  
> - If **2 players** delegate to it → plays A0

So:
- Only one delegate → M1 plays A1
- Both players delegate → M1 plays A0

This is interesting: **it adapts based on how many people delegate to it.**

Note: **You are Player 1**, so you choose whether to delegate or not. The other player does the same.

But we are not yet choosing to delegate — we are only voting on **which mediators are eligible**.

So we must consider: **if M1 becomes the winning mediator**, what will happen?

But remember: the winning mediator is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if we approve M1 and M2, and the other player approves only M2, then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 2 → M2 wins.

But if we approve both and the other player approves both, then both have 2 approvals → winner is random between M1 and M2.

So we have to assess: **Which mediator would give us better expected payoff, assuming it is selected?**

But we can't control that directly. We want to **maximize our expected payoff**, so we should approve a mediator **only if we expect it to be beneficial in the final game**.

---

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):**
> - If **1 player** delegates to it → plays A0  
> - If **2 players** delegate to it → plays A0

So:
- Whether 1 or 2 people delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So M2 always plays A0, regardless of number of delegations.

Therefore, **M2 is always A0**.

This is a very simple rule.

M2 is **always A0**, no matter how many delegates.

---

### **Step 3: Compare Mediator Effects**

We are Player 1. We want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

Let’s consider the possible outcomes **if a mediator is chosen**.

But **we don’t know** whether the other player will delegate or not, and whether they will approve the mediator.

But we can assume rational players — they will also want to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s think **what happens in each case**, depending on which mediator wins.

---

## Case 1: **M1 is the winning mediator**

Then, the mediator will:
- Play A1 if **only one** player delegates
- Play A0 if **both** players delegate

So the mediator’s action depends on **how many players delegate**.

Let’s suppose M1 is the winning mediator.

We (Player 1) decide whether to delegate to M1 or not.

The other player also chooses.

Let’s suppose both of us **delegate** → then M1 plays A0 → so we both get the action A0 (from mediator) vs original player’s action.

Wait! Important: **How exactly does delegation work?**

The description says:
> "If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it."

So:
- If you delegate, then the mediator **chooses your action** (based on # of delegates).
- The other player’s action is chosen independently — unless **they also delegate**.

So the **final actions** are:
- Your action: chosen by mediator (if you delegate) or chosen by you (if not)
- Other player’s action: chosen by them (if they act independently), or by the mediator (if they delegate)

So the outcome depends on:
- Who delegates to the mediator
- Which mediator is chosen

Let’s formalize.

---

### **Sub-step: What happens when M1 is the winner?**

Let M1 be the winning mediator.

Then:
- Number of delegators to M1 determines M1’s choice for **each** delegator.
- So:
  - If only one player delegates → mediator plays A1 for that player
  - If both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both

So, since M1 only plays A0 when both delegates → in that case, both players get A0.

If only one delegates → that player gets A1, the other player gets **their own choice** (unless they delegating to someone else — but only one mediator is selected, and only M1 is active).

So if M1 is the winning mediator, and:
- You delegate, other doesn't → you get A1, other gets their own choice
- You don’t delegate, other does → you get your choice, other gets A1
- Both delegate → both get A0

But this is **not symmetric** — the other player might act **as if they’re playing independently** in the non-delegated case.

Wait — **do non-delegators choose their action arbitrarily?**

The description says: "you can either delegate or act independently".

So:
- If you delegate → mediator chooses your action
- If you don’t delegate → you choose your own action (A0 or A1, or with a probability distribution?)

Wait — **the original game allows you to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.**

But when **you delegate**, the mediator chooses your action.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you choose your action.

But in this **approval step**, we are only voting — **we haven't yet decided how to act**.

So we need to think: **Once the mediator is selected, both players will choose whether to delegate, and if not, what action to play**.

But we are making a **strategic decision now**: which mediators to approve, to maximize our **expected payoff** over the full game.

So we have to predict:
- How players (including the other) will behave later, **given a mediator is chosen**
- And how the approval voting will work

This is complex.

But let’s simplify: Assume **we are rational**, and the **other player is also rational**, and we want to maximize our expected payoff.

But we don’t know how the other player will vote. So we have to make assumptions.

But since we are only deciding our own approvals, and the mediator is picked at random from the max-approved ones, we want to **approve mediators that are likely to be selected and are advantageous to us**.

Let’s **consider possible scenarios**.

---

## Step 4: Analyze Each Mediator’s Impact

Let’s look at the **expected payoffs** for us under different mediator selections.

We are Player 1.

Let’s suppose that **only one mediator is approved** — say M1.

Then M1 wins (since it’s the only one).

Now, both players will decide whether to delegate.

But **what is the goal?** Maximize own payoff.

So we must simulate **what happens if M1 is the mediator**.

---

### **Case A: M1 is the winning mediator**

Then:
- If both delegate → M1 plays A0 for both → both players get A0 → payoffs: (10,10)
- If only one delegates → that player gets A1, the other gets their own choice

Now, suppose **you delegate**, the other player **doesn’t delegate**.

Then:
- You get A1
- The other player chooses their action

What will the other player choose?

They want to maximize *their* payoff.

So:
- Your action: A1
- Their action: they can choose A0 or A1

If they play A0 → their payoffs: from (A1 vs A0) = 2
If they play A1 → their payoffs: from (A1 vs A1) = 4

So they will choose **A1**, since it gives 4 > 2.

So both play A1 → you get 4, they get 4.

Alternatively, if **you don’t delegate**, and the other **does delegate**, then:
- Other player gets A1
- You choose your action

Now, your best response to A1:
- If you play A0 → get 0
- If you play A1 → get 4
- So you play A1 → you get 4, other gets 4

So in both cases where **only one delegates**, both end up playing A1, so you get 4.

Now, if **both delegate** → both get A0 → you get 10.

So the **payoffs** depend on the strategy profile in delegation.

Now, suppose you are deciding whether to delegate, knowing that the other player will do the same (if rational).

Let’s say both players can choose to delegate or not.

We want to find **Nash equilibrium in the delegation stage**, given that M1 is active.

Let’s define the payoffs for each combination:

| You delegate? | Other delegate? | Your Action | Other's Action | Your Payoff |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Yes           | Yes              | A0 (M1)     | A0 (M1)        | 10           |
| Yes           | No               | A1 (M1)     | A1 (own)       | 4            |
| No            | Yes              | A1 (own)    | A1 (M1)        | 4            |
| No            | No               | A1 (theor.) | A1 (theor.)?   | ???          |

Wait — if **neither** delegates, then both choose actions independently — but what actions?

Ah! **This is crucial.**

If no one delegates, then both players play **independently** — so they can mix over A0 and A1.

But since we are in a decision-making stage, and the other player is rational, they will choose an action (or distribution) that maximizes their payoff given your choice.

But this is a beautiful cascade of reasoning.

However, **in the delegation step**, if no one delegates, then both play independently — so the game becomes the original one.

And we know: in the original game, the **Nash equilibria** are:
- (A0, A0): (10,10)
- (A1, A1): (4,4)

But are there others?

Check for mixed strategies.

Let’s suppose:
- You play A0 with probability p
- Other plays A0 with probability q

But since we are symmetric, assume they play same.

But the game is **not symmetric** — Player 1 and 2 have **different payoffs**.

Wait — look:

- In (A0, A0): both get 10 → symmetric
- In (A0, A1): you get 0, other gets 20
- In (A1, A0): you get 6, other gets 2
- In (A1, A1): both get 4

So **asymmetric payoffs**.

Let’s find **all Nash equilibria** of the base game.

Let’s suppose the other player plays A0 with probability q.

Your expected payoff for playing:
- A0: 10*q + 0*(1-q) = 10q
- A1: 6*q + 4*(1-q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4

Set equal: 10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So if other plays A0 with 0.5, you are indifferent.

If q < 0.5 → 10q < 2q+4 → A1 better → so you play A1
If q > 0.5 → A0 better → so you play A0

Now, for other player:
- Their payoff for A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2
- Their payoff for A1: 20p + 4(1-p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → impossible

So if p=0: their best response to your A0 is A1 (because 20 > 10)
If p=1: their best response is A1 (because 4 > 2)

Wait:
- If you play A0 (p=1): other gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → so chooses A1
- If you play A1 (p=0): other gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → chooses A1

So **for any p**, other player's best response is A1!

Because:
- If you play A0 → they get 20 (A1) > 10 (A0)
- If you play A1 → they get 4 (A1) > 2 (A0)

So **the other player's dominant strategy is A1**!

But that can’t be right? Because if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0 — bad.

But the other player doesn’t care about your payoff — only theirs.

So **in the base game, the other player (Player 2) always best responds with A1**, no matter what you do.

So **Player 2's dominant strategy is A1**.

Then, as Player 1, you best respond to A1:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4
→ So you prefer A1

So **only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**, where both play A1, both get 4.

There is **no other symmetric equilibrium**.

(A0, A0) is not an equilibrium because if you play A0 and they play A0, they get 10 — but if they deviate to A1, they get 20 — so they will deviate.

So the **only Nash equilibrium** of the base game is (A1, A1), with payoffs (4,4).

Even if you play A0, they will play A1.

But they get 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0 when you play A0.

So yes — **Player 2 always plays A1**, and you best respond with A1.

So **without delegation**, the outcome is **(A1, A1) → you get 4**.

---

Now, back to **M1**.

If M1 is the winning mediator, and both players choose whether to delegate.

Let’s analyze the **delegation game** under M1.

We need to find **Nash equilibrium** in delegation.

Possible profiles:

1. **Both delegate**:
   - M1 plays A0 for both → actions: A0, A0 → you get 10
2. **You delegate, other doesn't**:
   - You get A1 (M1)
   - Other plays A1 (dominant strategy)
   - So actions: A1, A1 → you get 4
3. **You don’t delegate, other does**:
   - You play A1 (best response to A1)
   - Other gets A1 (M1)
   - So (A1, A1) → you get 4
4. **Neither delegates**:
   - As above → (A1, A1) → both get 4

So the payoffs for you are:

| Your Deleg. | Other Deleg. | Your Payoff |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Yes         | Yes          | 10          |
| Yes         | No           | 4           |
| No          | Yes          | 4           |
| No          | No           | 4           |

Now, **do we have an incentive to delegate?**

Suppose the other player **always delegates**. Then:
- If you delegate → you get 10
- If you don’t → you get 4
→ So you prefer to delegate

If the other player **never delegates**, then:
- If you delegate → you get 4 (because other plays A1)
- If you don’t → you get 4
→ So indifferent

But since you are indifferent, you might delegate or not.

But **if both players are rational**, and we consider symmetric equilibrium.

Suppose both players **delegate** → then you both get 10.

Is this a Nash equilibrium?

Check: if other player delegates, do you want to deviate?

If you unilaterally **don’t delegate**, then:
- Other player delegates → gets A0 (M1)
- You don’t delegate → you best respond.

Other player’s action is A0.

Your best response to A0: A0 (gets 10) vs A1 (gets 6) → so you play A0.

So your action: A0

Other player: A0

So you get 10 — same as if you had delegated.

But wait: you didn’t delegate, so you choose A0, other chooses A0 via M1.

So outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 10.

So if you deviate (don’t delegate), you still get **10** (because you play A0), same as if you had delegated.

But if you delegate, you get A0 (from M1), same as if you play A0.

So no difference.

But now: **you are indifferent between delegating and not delegating** when the other delegates.

But if you don't delegate, you get to **choose your action** — so you can play A0.

But if you delegate, M1 gives you A0.

So **same outcome**.

So you are indifferent.

But now: **if both players delegate**, you get 10.

Is there an incentive to not delegate?

Only if by not delegating, you can get more — but you can’t.

So **both delegating is a Nash equilibrium**.

But also: **both not delegating is a Nash equilibrium?**

If both don’t delegate → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4.

Suppose you deviate and delegate.

Then:
- You delegate → get A1 (because only one delegate → M1 plays A1)
- Other doesn’t delegate → plays A1 (dominant strategy)
→ (A1, A1) → you get 4 — same as before.

So no gain → so you are indifferent.

So **several equilibria**.

But the key is: **if both delegate, you get 10**

If not, you get 4

So **both have incentive to coordinate on delegating**, but since it’s symmetric, it might not play out.

But **both delegating gives you 10**, which is better than 4.

So we want to **induce both to delegate**.

But from the payoff table, **you get 10 only if you and the other both delegate**.

So **your expected payoff depends on whether both delegate**.

Now, **how likely is that?**

But morally: if both want to delegate, and see that it gives 10, they might coordinate.

But since the game is symmetric in terms of utility (both get 10), there’s a chance.

But **in equilibrium**, it’s possible.

But more importantly: **if M1 is selected, and both players are rational**, then **they can coordinate on delegating**, and get 10 each.

So **expected payoff could be 10**, if they coordinate.

But if not, they get 4.

But let’s assume **they coordinate on the efficient outcome** — **both delegating**.

Then, under M1, you get **10**.

Now, what about **M2**?

---

### **Case B: M2 is the winning mediator**

M2 always plays A0, regardless of number of delegates.

So:
- If you delegate → you get A0
- If other delegates → they get A0
- If neither → both play independently → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4

Now, let’s see what happens.

If both delegate → you get A0, other gets A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10

If you delegate, other doesn’t → you get A0, other plays A1 → (A0, A1) → you get 0

If you don’t delegate, other does → you play A1, other gets A0 → (A1, A0) → you get 6

If neither delegates → (A1, A1) → you get 4

Now, let’s find best responses.

Suppose other player delegates → they get A0.

Now, you:
- If you delegate → get A0 → you get 10
- If you don’t delegate → you get your action. Best response: if other plays A0, you play A0 → get 10
→ So you get 10 either way.

So **you are indifferent**.

Similarly, if other doesn’t delegate → they play A1 (dominant strategy)

Then you:
- If you delegate → get A0 → you get 0
- If you don’t delegate → you play A1 → get 4
→ So you prefer **not to delegate**

Now, suppose you **don’t delegate** → other player…

Other player:
- If they delegate → they get A0
- If not → they play A1 → get 4
So they prefer to **not delegate**

So **if you don’t delegate, other prefers not to delegate**, so they get 4.

But if **you delegate**, and other doesn’t — you get A0, they get A1 → you get 0

But if you delegate, and other doesn’t, you get 0.

But since other will not delegate, you should **not delegate** either.

But in that case, both don’t delegate → (A1, A1) → you get 4

Could both delegate?
- If you delegate, you get A0
- But if other doesn’t delegate, other plays A1 → you get 0
- So you lose

So only if other also delegates → you get 10

But other won’t delegate unless you do?

Let’s see if **both delegating** is equilibrium.

Suppose both delegate:
- You get A0
- Other gets A0

Check deviation:
- If you deviate → don’t delegate → you get your action. Other plays A0 → so you play A0 → get 10 → same as before → so no incentive to deviate

Similarly for other.

So **both delegating is a Nash equilibrium** → both get 10.

But there’s another: both not delegating → both play A1 → get 4.

But if you deviate and delegate? You get A0 → and other plays A1 → you get 0 < 4 → so you won’t deviate.

So **both not delegating is also an equilibrium**.

But in that case, you get only 4.

But both delegating gives 10, which is better.

So rational players may coordinate on the **high-payoff equilibrium**.

So **if M2 is selected, and players coordinate on delegating**, you **get 10**.

Same as M1.

But **M1 gives 10 only if both delegate** — but **M2 also gives 10 if both delegate**.

So both mediators can lead to 10.

But wait — **M2 is always A0**, so if **only one delegates**, you get A0, other plays A1 → you get 0.

But in **M1**, if only one delegates, you get A1 (M1), other plays A1 → you get 4.

So **M1 is more forgiving** when only one delegates.

But under **M1**, if only one delegates, you get 4.

Under **M2**, if only one delegates, you get 0 (if you are the delegate) or 6 (if you are not).

Let’s clarify:

- **M2**: if you delegate, you get A0
  - If other doesn’t delegate → other plays A1 → you get 0
  - If other does → you get 10

- **M1**: if you delegate, you get A1 (if only one delegated)
  - Then other plays A1 → you get 4

So **if only one delegates**, in **M1** you get 4 (whether you delegate or not), but in **M2**:
  - If you delegate → you get 0
  - If you don't → you get 6

So **M1 gives you 4** if you are the only delegate, but M2 gives **you only 0** if you are the delegate.

So **M1 is better when you are the only delegate**.

But if both delegate, **both give you 10**.

But the problem: **you don't control if the other will delegate**.

But under **rational coordination**, **both will delegate** if they expect the other to.

But **if M2 is the mediator**, then:
- If you don't delegate, you can get 6 if other delegates (because you play A1 vs their A0)
- But if you delegate, you get 0 if they don't — but they won't, because they get only 4 if they don't delegate, but if they delegate, they get 10 — so they want to delegate.

Assume both players rational.

Suppose M2 is selected.

Both want to delegate? But if I delegate and they don't, I get 0; if I don't, and they do, I get 6.

So **I have an incentive to NOT delegate**, unless I’m sure they will.

But if I think they will delegate, I can get 10 by delegating.

But if I don’t delegate, I get 6 if they delegate.

6 < 10 → so I prefer to delegate.

So if you **expect the other to delegate**, then you should also delegate → you get 10.

Similarly for them.

So **both are better off delegating**.

So **both delegating is a stable equilibrium** under M2.

Similarly under M1.

So **both mediators can lead to (A0, A0) and 10 points for you**.

But what about M2’s downside?

If the other player is **not rational**, or coordination fails, then:

- Under M2: if only one delegates, the delegate gets 0
- Under M1: if only one delegates, the delegate gets 4

So **M1 is safer**.

But we assume rational players.

Now, the **key difference** is: **M2 is always A0**, so if you don’t delegate, you can play A1 and get 6 if the other plays A0.

But in reality, under M2:
- If other delegates, they play A0
- If you don’t delegate, you play A1 → (A1, A0) → you get 6
- But if you also delegate, you get A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10

So you prefer to delegate if the other does.

So again, **both should delegate**.

So both mediators seem similar.

But **M2 has a problem**: it is **always A0**, so if you **don’t delegate**, and the other **does delegate**, you get 6.

But if you **delegate**, you get 10.

So no issue.

But **M1** has a **risk**: if you delegate and other does **not** delegate, you get A1, other plays A1 → you get 4.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and other does, you get A1, they get A0 → you get 6.

But not much difference.

In both mediators, **if both delegate**, both get 10.

If only one delegates, M1 gives you 4, M2 gives you 0 (if you are delegate) or 6 (if not).

But since we want to **maximize our own payoff**, and we are rational, we want the mediator that **gives us higher payoff in equilibrium**.

But both allow 10.

Is there a reason to prefer one?

Wait — **M1 has an advantage**: when the number of delegates is 1, it plays A1.

So it encourages **a mixed outcome**.

But in practice, players can coordinate.

But here’s a key insight:

- M2 **always plays A0**, so if you delegate, you **can only get 10 or 0**
- M1 plays A0 only if **both** delegate, so it gives you **more chance** to get your preferred action

But in this case, **you prefer A0**, because it gives you 10, while A1 gives 4 or less.

So we want to get A0.

Now, **M2 is more reliable** at getting A0, because it always plays A0.

But **M1 only plays A0 if both delegate**, so it requires coordination.

But if you approve M2, then **the other player may be willing to delegate**, because they know they can get A0.

But if M1 is approved, and both delegate, both get 10.

But if only one delegates to M1, they get A1.

So M1 is **escalating the risk** of getting A1.

But the other player knows: if they don't delegate, they play A1 (dominant), so if only one delegates (to M1), they get A1, other gets A1 → you get 4.

But if both delegate, you get 10.

So both have incentive.

But M2 is simpler: if you delegate, you get A0, period.

So **M2 ensures you get A0** if you delegate.

But if you don't delegate, you can get A1.

But the rational choice is to **delegate**, so you get A0.

So M2 gives you more **control**.

But M1 has a **disadvantage**: if you delegate and the other doesn’t, you get A1 — which is bad.

Whereas if you delegate to M2, you get A0.

So M2 is **less risky**.

Moreover, **if the other player delegates to M2**, you get A0, and you can get 10 if you also delegate.

But if you don't delegate, and they do, you get A1, they get A0 → you get 6.

So you might prefer not to delegate, but 6 < 10, so you want to delegate.

Same conclusion.

But the point is: **M2 is more predictable**.

But here’s the final decision:

You are player 1.

You can **approve mediators**.

The winning mediator is chosen at random from those with the maximum approvals.

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Suppose you approve only M2.

Then if the other player also approves M2, M2 wins with probability 1.

Expected payoff: 10 (if both delegate)

If you approve only M1, and they approve, M1 wins, you get 10 on average.

But now, suppose you approve **both**.

Then both M1 and M2 have 1 approval (if other approves only one), so the winner is random.

But if both approve both, then both have 2 approvals → winner random between M1 and M2.

You get 10 if either is selected, but **only if both delegate**.

But **M1 may be riskier** because it plays A1 if only one delegate.

But in every case, with rational players, both will delegate to get 10.

So both mediators give you 10.

But M2 has **no downside**: if you delegate, you get A0.

M1 has: if only one delegates, you get A1.

But both are unlikely.

But here’s a **crucial point**:

**M1 is proposed by Player 1 (you)**.

M2 by Player 2.

If you approve M1, you are supporting your own proposal.

But in the approval voting, you are not voting for the mediator but for whether it can be selected.

But you have **no reason to disapprove M2**, because M2 is better for you.

But wait: if both mediators are approved, and the other player may approve only M2 or both.

But you want the mediator that **benefits you most**.

But both seem to give you 10 in equilibrium.

But let’s compare the **risk**.

In M2, if you delegate, you get A0.

In M1, if you delegate, you might get A0 or A1, depending on the other.

But if you delegate to M1 and other cooperates, you get A0.

But if not, you get A1.

But since you want A0, **M2** is **better** because it **always plays A0 when you delegate**.

M1 plays A1 if only you delegate.

So M2 guarantees A0 if you delegate.

Therefore, M2 is **more reliable**.

Moreover, M2 is **stronger** in coordination: you have less risk.

Therefore, **you should approve M2**.

But what about M1?

M1 is proposed by you, so you might feel it’s yours.

But **you are not voting for it**, but for whether it can be selected.

You should approve a mediator only if it **can help you**.

M1 doesn't hurt you, but M2 is better.

But here’s the key: **M2 is always A0**, so it avoids the risk of getting A1.

But M1 might lead to (A1, A1) if only one delegates.

But rational players will coordinate.

But M2 is safer.

Moreover, **if you approve only M2**, and the other player approves M2, then you get to use M2, which is good.

If you approve both, and the other approves only M2, then M2 wins.

If you approve both, and they approve both, then random — but M1 is riskier.

So to **maximize reliability**, you should approve only **M2**.

But what if M2 is not approved by the other?

You can’t control that.

But since you are choosing your approvals, and you want to **increase the chance of getting a good mediator**, and you believe M2 is better for you, you should approve M2.

But should you disapprove M1?

You can, if you want.

But M1 might be acceptable.

But since M2 is better and safer, and M1 is riskier, you should **approve M2** and **disapprove M1**, to push the system toward M2.

Moreover, M1 is proposed by you — but you’re a rational player, so you should not approve your own proposal if it’s worse.

Therefore, **you should approve M2 and not approve M1**.

But let’s confirm:

- If M2 is selected → you can achieve 10
- If M1 is selected → you can achieve 10, but with risk of 4 if coordination fails
- M2 has no risk if you delegate

So **M2 is superior**.

Therefore, **approve M2, disapprove M1**.

Final answer:

```json

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (no mediator)**

We are Player 2 in a simultaneous two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from Player 2’s perspective):

|            | Other player chooses A0 | Other player chooses A1 |
|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **You choose A0** | You: 10, Other: 10       | You: 2, Other: 6         |
| **You choose A1** | You: 20, Other: 0        | You: 4, Other: 4         |

We are to maximize **our own points**, so we care only about the left-hand values.

Let’s denote:
- Our choice: A0 or A1
- Opponent's choice: A0 or A1
- We want to choose an action (or a mixed strategy) to maximize expected payoff, given that the opponent also acts strategically.

Let’s analyze best responses.

---

### **Step 2: Find Nash equilibrium in the base game**

Let’s suppose:
- We (Player 2) choose A0 with probability p, A1 with 1−p
- Opponent (Player 1) chooses A0 with probability q, A1 with 1−q

We compute expected payoff for us:

- If we play A0:  
  → 10*q + 2*(1−q) = 10q + 2 − 2q = 8q + 2

- If we play A1:  
  → 20*q + 4*(1−q) = 20q + 4 − 4q = 16q + 4

We will be indifferent between A0 and A1 when:
8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → −8q = 2 → q = −0.25 → not possible

Since this is impossible (q cannot be negative), we see:

- For **any** q ∈ [0,1], 16q + 4 > 8q + 2? Let’s check:
  - At q=0: 16(0)+4 = 4 vs 8(0)+2 = 2 → A1 better
  - At q=1: 16+4=20 vs 8+2=10 → A1 better

So A1 always gives higher expected payoff than A0 **regardless of opponent’s choice**

→ Therefore, **A1 is strictly dominant for Player 2**

Now, what about Player 1?

Player 1’s payoffs:
- A0: 10q’ + 2(1−q’) → but wait, let’s be careful.

Wait, in the matrix:
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and we (Player 2) choose A0: 10,10
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and we choose A1: 0,20
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and we choose A0: 6,2
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and we choose A1: 4,4

So Player 1’s payoffs:
- A0: 10 * p + 0 * (1−p) = 10p
- A1: 6 * p + 4 * (1−p) = 6p + 4 − 4p = 2p + 4

Compare:
- A0: 10p
- A1: 2p + 4

Set equal: 10p = 2p + 4 → 8p = 4 → p = 0.5

So:
- If p < 0.5 → A1 better for P1
- If p > 0.5 → A0 better
- If p = 0.5 → indifferent

But we know from earlier that **as Player 2, A1 is strictly dominant**, so we will always play A1 (p = 1).

Therefore, Player 1’s best response: since p = 1, A0 gives 10*1 = 10, A1 gives 2*1 + 4 = 6 → so A0 better.

So both players playing optimally:
- Player 2: A1 (p=1)
- Player 1: A0 (q=1)

→ Outcome: (A1, A0)

→ We (Player 2) get 20 points.

---

### **Step 3: Now consider the mediator system**

We are allowed to **delegate** our move to a mediator.

But **first**, we must **vote via approval voting** for which mediator to include.

There are **two mediators** proposed — both are identical:

> **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

> **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **They are identical in behavior.**

So M1 and M2 are functionally the same.

Now, we must decide **which mediators to approve**, knowing:
- The winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- We want to **maximize our expected number of points**.
- We can approve both, one, or none.

But **we should also consider potential cooperation or strategic coordination**.

Wait — the mediator only plays **based on the number of delegations**, not on who delegates.

So the behavior is solely:
- 1 delegator → A1
- 2 delegators → A0

Now, we must think: **If we delegate, what happens?**

Our action is replaced by the mediator’s action (which depends on how many people use it).

But note: we are **Player 2**, and we can choose to delegate or not.

The key strategic question: **Should we delegate? To which mediator?**

But there's **only one function**, and it's offered by two players. Since the behavior is the same, it doesn't matter which one we pick, in terms of outcome.

But we must decide **whether to approve** each.

Let’s consider the possible outcomes based on delegation.

Let’s denote:
- D: we delegate
- Not D: we act independently

Similarly for the other player.

But since the mediator behavior depends only on the **number** of delegators, and not who they are, we can analyze all combinations.

But also: **we don’t know how the other player will vote** — so we must consider what happens depending on how many **mediators are approved**, and how many **delegations actually occur**.

But remember: **approval voting selects the set of mediators that are “in”**, and the **winning one is chosen uniformly at random from the approved ones with maximum approvals**.

Then, **when a player delegates, they choose a mediator from the approved set**? Not necessarily.

Wait — the description says:
> "the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

And:
> "you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator."

But it **does not** say that you pick which one to delegate to — it says **the winning mediator** (the one selected by approval voting) is the one that acts on your behalf.

So **only one mediator exists at the end** — the one that wins the approval vote.

Then, if you delegate, **you delegate to that winner**.

So we must choose which mediators to approve, so that **the winning mediator (the one that will be used)** is the one we prefer.

But both mediators behave identically — so it doesn’t matter which one wins.

So **M1 and M2 are indistinguishable in effect**.

Therefore, **approving both will increase the chance that a mediator is selected**, but if only one is approved, that one wins.

But the **key is**: if **no mediator** is approved, then **no delegation is possible** — so both players must act independently.

But if **at least one** is approved, then one is selected (randomly among those with max approvals), and delegation to that one is allowed.

So our decision affects:
- Whether a mediator exists
- Which one (though they’re same)
- And potentially, whether we can later choose to delegate

But the **mediator’s action depends only on the total number of delegations**, not on which mediator is chosen.

So since M1 and M2 behave identically, **the outcome only depends on whether mediation is available and how many delegate**.

So the only meaningful choice is: **do we want to allow a mediator, and if so, how?**

Now, suppose we **only approve M1**, and the other player approves M1 — then M1 wins (max approvals =1, only one).

Similarly, if we approve only M1 and other approves M2 → then both have 1 approval → both tied for max → winner chosen uniformly at random between M1 and M2 → but since identical, no difference.

If we approve both M1 and M2 → then both have 2 approvals → so max is 2 → winner chosen randomly between M1 and M2 → again, no difference.

So all cases lead to same outcome in terms of behavior: the mediator plays A1 if 1 person delegates, A0 if 2 delegate.

But **our voting strategy affects whether a mediator is available and the likelihood of delegation**.

But here’s the crucial point: **we are told that the game proceeds only after the approval vote.**

We **must**, in our output, give our approvals.

But we don’t know what the other player will do.

So we must assume the other player is rational and will try to maximize their own payoff.

But we **can** try to **coordinate or predict**.

Let’s consider possible worlds.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze possible scenarios by our approval choice**

We are trying to **maximize our expected points**.

We will consider the **equilibrium** of the overall process.

Let’s denote our approval choices: [M1, M2]

We need to decide: should we approve M1? M2?

But since they are identical, we might as well approve both, or neither, or one.

Let’s test strategies.

---

#### **Option A: Approve both M1 and M2**

Then, both have 1 approval (from us), and then the other player will also vote.

Suppose other player approves:

- M1 only → then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → M1 wins (max=2)
- M2 only → M2 wins (max=2)
- Both → both have 2 → one chosen uniformly: M1 or M2 with 50%
- Neither → both have 1 → both tied → winner chosen randomly between M1 and M2

In all cases, a mediator exists.

So **a mediator is always available** if we approve both.

Then, delegation is allowed.

Now, we can choose to delegate or not, depending on our strategy.

Similarly, the other player can choose to delegate or not.

But now, **our action depends on whether we delegate**.

So possible outcomes (based on number of delegators):

| Delegators | Mediator plays | We (P2) gets if we delegate | We get if we don’t delegate |
|------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 0          | ? (not used)   | → We act independently → our choice only |
| 1          | A1             | → We get 4 or 20? Depends on opponent |
| 2          | A0             | → We get 2 or 10? |

But **we must consider**: if we delegate, we give up control.

So to decide whether to delegate, we need to compare:

- Expected payoff **if we act independently**
- Expected payoff **if we delegate**

But in the delegation case, the mediator’s action depends on **how many delegate**.

So we need to simulate the **full game with delegation**.

But let’s suppose we **approve both M1 and M2** → so mediator is in → a mediator exists.

Now, both players know this.

Now each player must decide: delegate or not?

Let’s find **equilibrium of the delegation game**.

Let’s denote:

- Player 1 (opponent) decides: delegate or not
- Player 2 (us) decides: delegate or not

Let’s define the **joint decision**.

Let’s assume the mediator is ready (since we approved both) → so delegation is possible.

Now the mediator plays:
- A1 if exactly one player delegates
- A0 if both delegate or neither

Wait! The rules say:
> “If 1 player(s) delegate...” → A1
> “If 2 player(s) delegate...” → A0

So:
- 0 delegators: mediator not used → no action?
  But if we don’t delegate, we act independently — so mediator doesn’t play.

But if **no one delegates**, then **no mediator is used**, and both act independently.

So mediator only comes into play **if at least one delegates**.

But the behavior specification says "if 1 player delegates" → A1, "if 2" → A0.

So if 0 delegate, the mediator doesn’t play — so we just play normally.

So delegation decisions affect:
- If 0 delegate: both play as independent players → we already saw that, in equilibrium, P2 plays A1, P1 plays A0 → we get 20.

- If 1 delegate: mediator plays A1 → so the **delegator gets A1**, the non-delegator can choose.
- If 2 delegate: mediator plays A0 → both get A0.

Now, let’s suppose we (P2) are considering **whether to delegate**.

We know the other player will also decide.

Let’s suppose that both players are rational and want to maximize their own points.

Let’s consider possible switching points.

Suppose we (P2) are currently playing A1 independently → that gives us 20 if opponent plays A0.

But if we delegate, and only one delegates (us), then mediator plays A1 → we get A1.

So if we delegate and opponent does not:
- We play A1
- Opponent plays whatever they do independently

But opponent’s decision: if they do not delegate, they choose independently.

They will choose to maximize their payoff.

If the opponent **does not delegate**, they’ll play their best response.

We are playing A1 (if we delegate), so opponent sees:
- If they choose A0: they get 10
- If they choose A1: they get 4

So they choose A0 → get 10.

So if we delegate and they do not, we get A1, they get A0 → we get 20 points.

Same as before.

But if we delegate and they also delegate:
- Both get A0 (mediator plays A0)
- So we get 10 points (since we play A0, opponent plays A0)

Previously, without delegation, we get 20.

So if they delegate, we get only 10 → worse.

Now, should we delegate?

We get 20 if opponent does not delegate.

But if opponent **also** delegates, we get 10 → worse than 20.

But **opponent** will consider their own payoff.

Suppose we (P2) decide to **delegate**.

Then, the opponent must decide: delegate or not.

If opponent does not delegate:
- Mediator plays A1 (since one delegator)
- Opponent plays independently → they get to choose A0 or A1
- Opponent: if they play A0 → get 10 (since we play A1)
- If they play A1 → get 4 (since we play A1)
→ So they prefer A0 → get 10

So opponent gets 10 if they don’t delegate.

If opponent **does** delegate:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0
- So both play A0 → opponent gets 10

But wait! If they play A0, and we play A0, both get 10.

So opponent gets **10** in both cases:
- If not delegate: play A0, we play A1 → get 10
- If delegate: play A0, we play A0 → get 10

→ So they are **indifferent** between delegating or not.

So if we delegate, opponent is indifferent.

But if they are indifferent, we must assume they choose a strategy — say, best response.

They can just pick the one that gives them 10 — both do.

So they could delegate or not.

But now, we must consider **our expected payoff** depending on their choice.

But since they are indifferent, we cannot predict.

But in game theory, we assume they choose optimally — including possibly mixing.

But for simplicity, suppose they act to minimize our payoff? No — they act to maximize their own.

Since both options give them 10, they are indifferent.

But we are concerned with **our** expected payoff.

So if we delegate:
- With some probability, opponent does not delegate → we get 20
- With some probability, opponent delegates → we get 10

Let’s suppose the opponent chooses **not to delegate** (which is fine, since it’s a best response).

Or suppose they delegate — then we get 10.

But **since they are indifferent**, we cannot be sure.

But from **our** perspective, if we delegate, and the opponent chooses not to delegate, we get 20.

But if the opponent also delegates, we get only 10.

But **how likely is that**?

We don’t know.

But here’s a better idea: **if we delegate, and opponent also delegates, we both get 10**.

But **if we had not delegated**, and opponent did not delegate, we get 20.

So the **risk** of delegating is that the opponent might also delegate → we get only 10.

But if they don’t delegate, we get 20 — same as not delegating.

So **delegating gives us the same payoff if opponent doesn’t delegate, and less if they do**.

So **delegating is worse than or equal to not delegating**, **as long as the opponent chooses not to delegate**.

But if the opponent is **tempted** to delegate to force A0 and get 10, but they could also get 10 by not delegating.

But **delegating** also means they give up control — but in this case, they get the same payoff.

So they are indifferent.

But peel back further: **what if we do not delegate?**

Then we play independently.

We will play A1 (dominant strategy).

Opponent, seeing that we play A1, will play A0 (since A0 gives 10, A1 gives 4).

→ So we get 20.

So **without any delegation**, we get 20.

Now, if **we delegate** and opponent does not: we get 20.

Same.

But if opponent **also delegates**, we get 10.

So **delegating risks dropping our payoff to 10**.

But **from the opponent’s perspective**, if they delegate when we delegate, they get 10.

If they don’t, they also get 10.

So they are indifferent.

But **they might worry that if they don’t delegate, we will delegate, and then they get A1 (because we are delegating → mediator plays A1)? No — the mediator only acts if at least one delegates.

Wait: **if we delegate and they don’t**, then **only one delegate**, so mediator plays A1 → we play A1.

Then opponents choose independently → they pick A0 → get 10.

So no harm.

But suppose we **do not delegate**.

Then, if opponent **does** delegate, what happens?

- Opponent delegates → mediator plays A1 (since only one delegate)
- So opponent plays A1
- We play A1 (independently)
- So outcome: (A1, A1) → we get 4

Ah! This is critical!

If **we do not delegate**, and opponent **does**, then:
- Mediator plays A1 (only one delegate)
- Opponent plays A1
- We play A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → we get **4 points**!

But if no one delegates, we get 20.

So **if we do not delegate, and opponent delegates**, we get only 4 points.

But if we delegate, and opponent does not, we get 20.

If both delegate, we get 10.

So the risk is that if opponent delegates and we don’t, we get 4.

But in the case where we delegate and opponent doesn’t, we get 20.

So our strategy must account for this.

Let’s do a full equilibrium analysis **given that a mediator exists**.

Assume both players know a mediator exists (because we approved both, so it’s possible).

Now, choose whether to delegate.

Let’s find **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose:
- We (P2) delegate with probability p
- Opponent (P1) delegate with probability q

We compute our expected payoff.

But we can simplify by checking best responses.

Case 1: **Suppose opponent does NOT delegate (q=0)**

Then:
- If we delegate: one delegate → mediator plays A1 → we play A1
- Opponent plays independently → they choose A0 (best for them)
→ we get 20

- If we do not delegate: no delegate → both play independently → we play A1, opponent plays A0 → we get 20

→ So we are indifferent between delegating or not.

But if we delegate, we get 20.

If not, we get 20.

So no incentive to delegate.

But **wait**: if we delegate and q=0, opponent plays A0 → we play A1 → we get 20.

Same as not delegating.

So no difference.

But now suppose: **opponent delegates (q=1)**

Then:
- If we delegate: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → we play A0
- Opponent plays A0 → we get 10

- If we do not delegate: only opponent delegates → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1
- We play A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → we get 4

So if opponent delegates, we get:
- 10 if we delegate
- 4 if we do not

So we prefer to delegate.

Therefore: **Best response depends on opponent’s action**

- If opponent **does not delegate**, we are **indifferent**.
- If opponent **does delegate**, we should **delegate**.

Now, what about opponent?

If we **do not delegate**, and opponent considers delegating:

- If opponent delegates: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1
- We play A1 → so (A1, A1) → opponent gets 4

- If opponent does **not** delegate: no delegation → both play independently → we play A1, opponent plays A0 → opponent gets 10

So if we **don’t delegate**, opponent gets:
- 4 if they delegate
- 10 if they don’t

So opponent prefers **not to delegate**.

But if we **do delegate**, then:

- If opponent doesn’t delegate: we play A1, opponent plays A0 → opponent gets 10
- If opponent does delegate: both play A0 → opponent gets 10

So in either case, opponent gets 10.

So **opponent is indifferent** if we delegate.

So best response:
- If we don’t delegate → opponent prefers not to delegate (gets 10 vs 4)
- If we delegate → opponent is indifferent (gets 10 either way)

So **in equilibrium**, what happens?

Let’s suppose the opponent **never delegates**.

Then, if we don’t delegate, we get 20.

If we delegate, we get 20.

So we are indifferent.

But we can choose.

But if we choose to **delegate**, then opponent is indifferent — they could still not delegate → then we get 20.

But if they choose to **delegate**, we get 10.

But since they are indifferent, they might delegate.

But if they delegate, we get 4 if we don’t delegate, or 10 if we do.

So **if we delegate**, even if opponent delegates, we get 10.

But if we **don’t delegate**, and opponent delegates, we get 4.

So **it’s safer to delegate**, because we reduce the risk of getting 4.

So from our perspective, **we should delegate**, because:
- If opponent doesn’t delegate → we get 20 regardless
- If opponent does delegate → we get 10 if we delegate, but only 4 if we don’t

So **delegating is a dominant strategy** for us, **given that a mediator exists**.

Similarly, for the opponent:
- If we don’t delegate → opponent prefers not to delegate (gets 10 vs 4)
- If we do delegate → opponent is indifferent (gets 10 either way)

But if they are indifferent, they might choose not to delegate.

But **if they choose not to delegate**, then we get 20 → good.

But if they choose to delegate, we get 10.

But **we are the ones deciding to delegate**.

So suppose we **delegate**.

Then opponent, being indifferent, might not delegate.

Then we get 20.

But if we **don’t delegate**, and opponent **does** delegate, we get 4.

So to avoid getting 4, we should delegate.

Thus, **the equilibrium is: we delegate, and opponent does not delegate (or is indifferent)**.

Then:
- Only we delegate → mediator plays A1 → we play A1
- Opponent plays A0 → we get 20

Same as independent play.

So **nothing gained** — but **no risk of getting 4**.

So delegating **protects us** against the risk of opponent delegating and us not delegating.

But **if we delegate**, we are safe: if opponent delegates → we get 10, if not → we get 20.

But **if we don’t delegate**, and opponent delegates → we get only 4.

So **we should delegate**, to avoid the bad outcome.

So **in the delegated world, we prefer to delegate**.

But what if **no mediator is available**?

Then we must play independently.

We get 20.

But if a mediator is available, and we delegate, we can get at least 10, and potentially 20.

But in expectation, if we delegate and opponent does not, we get 20.

If opponent does, 10.

But if opponent is rational, they prefer not to delegate when we don’t.

But if we delegate, they don’t care.

So in equilibrium, we delegate, opponent does not — we get 20.

Same as without mediator.

So **no improvement**.

But it **protects us** from the opponent overwhelming us.

But in this case, **there’s no benefit**.

But **what if we do not approve any mediator?**

Then no mediator exists.

So neither player can delegate.

So both play independently.

We get 20.

Now, suppose we **approve only one mediator**, say M1.

Then:
- If other player approves M1 → then M1 has 2 approvals → wins
- If other approves M2 → M1 and M2 each have 1 → random winner → say M1 or M2 → same behavior
- If other approves neither → M1 has 1, M2 has 0 → M1 wins

So in all cases, the mediator exists.

So **if we approve any mediator**, and since the other player might approve at least one, the mediator will likely exist.

But if we **approve neither**, then no mediator exists — then we play independent, get 20.

But if we **approve one or both**, then **a mediator is more likely to exist**, and then we can potentially delegate.

But as we saw, **delegating doesn’t help**, only protects us.

But **does it hurt**?

No — it only helps avoid the 4-point outcome.

So **we are better off if a mediator exists**, so that we can **avoid the risk of getting 4**.

But if we **do not approve any**, then **no mediator** → no delegation → we play independently → we get 20.

But **opponent might still delegate?** No — **if no mediator**, delegation not possible.

So if **no mediator**, we both play independently → we get 20.

But if **a mediator exists**, and we **delegate**, we can get 20 or 10.

But **we can still get 20**.

And **we are protected from getting 4**.

So **better to have a mediator available**.

But if we **approve no mediator**, then **we cannot delegate**, and opponent cannot delegate.

So we are safe — always get 20.

But **if we approve a mediator, and opponent also approves it**, then **mediator exists**.

But what if **opponent dislikes** the mediator?

For example, if it pushes us to A1 when we delegate.

But since we are the one choosing whether to delegate, and we can choose to delegate to avoid risk, it seems good.

But **the choice is about the approval vote**, not about delegation.

We must approve mediators so that **the winning one is good for us**, or that a mediator exists.

But since both mediators are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But now, if we **approve both**, we ensure that **even if the other player approves only one**, a mediator exists.

If we approve only one, and they approve the other, then both have 1 → so the random winner is selected → still a mediator exists.

Only if we approve **nothing**, and they approve **nothing**, then no mediator.

But if we approve **anything**, then a mediator exists **unless the other player approves nothing and we approve only one, but that one loses?**

No: if we approve M1, and other approves nothing, then M1 has 1, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.

So **any approval by us ensures that a mediator exists**, as long as the other player doesn’t approve more.

Wait, no: if we approve M1, and they approve M1, then M1 wins (2 approvals)

If we approve M1, they approve M2, then both have 1 → winner chosen at random → still a mediator exists.

Only if **we approve nothing**, and **they approve nothing**, then no mediator.

So:

- **If we approve at least one**, a mediator **will exist**.
- Only if we approve **none**, and they approve **none**, no mediator.

But we **don’t control the other player**.

So to **ensure** that a mediator exists, we should approve at least one.

But if we approve **none**, there is a **chance** that a mediator exists (if they approve one), but also a **chance** that it doesn’t.

But we want to **maximize expected payoff**.

If a mediator does not exist, we get 20.

If a mediator exists, we can delegate and get at least 10, and likely 20.

So **we prefer** that a mediator exists.

But **it's not certain** unless we approve.

So the **safe way** is to approve **at least one** mediator.

But since both are identical, we might as well approve both.

Alternatively, approve one.

But if we approve both, we increase our influence.

But since they are identical, it doesn't matter.

But we have **no downside** to approving both.

In fact, if we approve both:
- Even if the other player approves nothing, we have a mediator.
- If they approve one, we have a mediator.
- If they approve both, still have.

So **by approving both**, we **guarantee** that a mediator exists, regardless of their action.

Similarly, if we approve only one, and they approve neither, the mediator exists.

But if they approve the other one, still exists.

So actually, **as long as we approve at least one**, a mediator exists.

Only if we approve **nothing**, it might not.

But we want to **maximize expected payoff**, so we want to **minimize the risk of no mediator**.

So we should approve **at least one**.

But which one?

Both are identical.

So we can approve both.

But is there any harm in approving both?

No.

In fact, **we should approve both** to ensure the mediator exists and to have more options.

But since they are the same, it doesn't matter.

So the best move is: **approve both M1 and M2**.

Thus, we maximize the chance that a mediator is present, and since the behavior is good for us (can avoid the 4-point trap), it’s beneficial.

Final decision:

We approve both.

{"M1": true, "M2": true}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.

2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2 (me), we need to consider both the payoffs and the possible influence of the mediator.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Evaluate Payoffs Without Mediator (Direct Actions A0 and A1):**
    - If both players choose A0: I get 10 points.
    - If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: I get 20 points.
    - If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: I get 2 points.
    - If both players choose A1: I get 4 points.

2. **Evaluate Payoff with Mediator (Delegate Action A2):**
    - Given that the mediator always plays A0 whether it's one or two players delegating:
      - If I delegate and Player 1 does not: I'll play A0. 
        - If Player 1 plays A0: I get 10 points.
        - If Player 1 plays A1: I get 2 points.
      - If both players delegate (both to mediator):
        - Both will play A0: I get 10 points.

3. **Consider Probabilities (Mixed Strategies):**
    - I need to capture probabilities for actions A0, A1, and A2 (Delegate).
    - For maximizing points:
        - Without delegation, choosing A1 seems to have higher potential payoffs but is risky.
        - Delegation (via A2) seems safer for an average decent outcome:
          - If Player 1 also delegates, we both get 10 points.
          - If Player 1 does not delegate but plays A0, I still get 10 points.
          - It avoids the lowest payoff of 0.

### Design the Mixed Strategy:
We can consider different scenarios and expected points. We should balance between:
- Direct action for potentially higher points.
- Delegation for safer coordination (mediator ensures A0).
  
**Strategy:**
- Given that delegation ensures at least 10 points (if the opponent is mutual or less).
- Play a good portion (but not all) to delegation.
- A smaller portion to high-reward (but risky) actions like A1.

**Final Distribution:**
- Delegate (A2): High probability to leverage mediator safety.
- Direct actions (A0, A1): Remaining portion, emphasizing one to ensure payoff spread.

Let us decide: 
- 70% delegate to mediator for safety (A2).
- The remaining 30% can be:
    - 10% play direct high rewards (A1).
    - 20% play safer direct self without mediator (A0).

Finally, balance:
- A0: 20%
- A1: 10%
- A2: 70%

### JSON Output
```json
{
  "A0": 20,
  "A1": 10,
  "A2": 70
}
```
This strategy seeks to utilize the mediator for safety while still playing some direct actions to maximize potential points.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are Player 2 in a 2-player simultaneous move game. The possible actions are A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (for Player 2, since we're in that role) is:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0 (Player 1) | A1 (Player 1) |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**                              | 10            | 2             |
| **A1**                              | 20            | 4             |

So for **Player 2** (you), the payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

Let’s analyze this as a standard game.

#### **Best Responses for Player 2 (you):**

If you think Player 1 will play A0:
- Your best response is A1 → 20 > 10

If you think Player 1 will play A1:
- Your best response is A1 → 4 > 2

So **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for you** (Player 2).

#### **What does Player 1 do?**
Let’s now look at payoffs for Player 1:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------------------|----|----|
| A0                  | 10 | 0  |
| A1                  | 6  | 4  |

For Player 1:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → best response is A0 (10 > 6)
- If Player 2 plays A1 → best response is A1 (4 > 0)

So:
- If Player 1 thinks you'll play A0 → they play A0
- If Player 1 thinks you'll play A1 → they play A1

This suggests a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

But we are not necessarily playing equilibrium. However, **since A1 is strictly dominant for you (Player 2)**, you will **always play A1** (even if probabilistically) in rational play.

So **you expect to play A1**, and **you expect Player 1 to respond to your A1 by playing A1** (since if you play A1, their best response is A1 — getting 4 vs 0).

Thus, in a rational equilibrium: **both play A1 → payoff is (4,4)**.

But wait — if you play A1, and they play A0, you get 20. So **you'd prefer** if they played A0, but they have no incentive to do that if you play A1.

Let me double-check: if you play A1, Player 1 gets:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4 → so A1 is better.

Yes → so they will not play A0 if they know you play A1.

Hence the payoff (A1, A1) = (4,4) is the rational outcome.

So **without delegation**, if both play rationally, you get 4 points.

But **you want to maximize your points**. So you need to **deviate from this if possible** — perhaps via delegation.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

Two mediators proposed:
- **M1**: Proposed by Player 1
- **M2**: Proposed by Player 2

Their behavior:
> - If 1 player delegates: play A1  
> - If 2 players delegate: play A0

**Both M1 and M2 have identical behavior.**

So they are **identical in policy**. They only differ in who proposed them.

Now, the approval voting process:
- You and Player 1 vote on which mediators to approve.
- The winning mediator is chosen **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.
- Then, **you can choose** to delegate to a mediator (or not), based on the outcome.

But **your decision is only about approval** — not about delegation yet.

So your **choice of whether to approve M1 and M2** will affect:
- Which mediating scenarios are possible
- Whether the final mediator is M1, M2, or both (if both get equal approvals)

But since M1 and M2 are **identical in behavior**, approving one or the other **doesn’t matter functionally** — they behave the same.

So **the only reason to approve or reject depends on strategic expectation about how the other player votes**.

But here’s a key point: **You are trying to maximize your own points**, so you want **a mediator that helps you get more than 4 points**, ideally more like 20.

Let’s look at what outcomes can occur with delegation.

---

### **Step 3: How Delegation Works with Mediators**

You can choose:
- Act independently
- Delegate to a mediator (if one is elected)

But first, you **approve mediators via voting**. Then, the **winning mediator is selected uniformly at random among those with the most approvals**.

So if you approve both M1 and M2, and Player 1 approves only one, then both M1 and M2 get 1 approval → both tie → **one is selected uniformly at random (50% each)**.

If you approve both, and Player 1 approves only M1 → M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

If you approve only M1, and Player 1 approves only M1 → M1 wins.

But **you don’t know how Player 1 will vote** — so you must anticipate their behavior.

---

### **Step 4: Strategic Analysis of the Mediator Behavior**

Recall mediator behavior:
- If **1 player delegates** → mediator plays A1
- If **2 players delegate** → mediator plays A0

So:

| Delegation Pattern | What Mediator Plays |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| You delegate, not Player 1 | Mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate) |
| Player 1 delegates, not you | Mediator plays A1 (only 1 delegate) |
| Both delegate | Mediator plays A0 (2 delegates) |
| Neither delegates | No mediator → you must choose yourself |

Now, since **you are Player 2**, and **you want to maximize your points**, you want to **choose the actions that give you high payoff**.

Let’s examine the possible outcomes **if a mediator is elected**, and you decide whether to delegate.

#### **Case 1: No mediator is selected (i.e., no approval from you or them)** → you go back to base game.

But since you can always choose to delegate, but only if a mediator is approved and wins.

But if **you approve no mediator**, then no mediator wins, and you have to act independently.

But **you may still want to delegate**, unless you get even more points acting independently.

We need to decide: **under what situations can the mediator help you?**

Let’s go through possible configurations.

---

### **Step 5: What Outcome Do You Want?**

You want to maximize your points.

From payoff matrix:
- Best outcome for you: (A1, A0) → you get 20
- Second best: (A0, A0) → 10
- Worse: (A0, A1) → 2
- Worst: (A1, A1) → 4

You want to avoid (A1, A1) if possible, since you get only 4.

So your ideal scenario is to get A1 while the other player plays A0 → 20 points.

Is that possible with delegation?

Yes — **if you delegate to a mediator**, and only **you** delegate, then:
- Mediator plays A1 (since only one delegate)
- So you play A1

Now, if **Player 1 does not delegate**, and plays independently, what do they do?

From earlier: their dominant strategy is not obvious, but their best response to your A1 is A1 (since 4 > 0).

So they'll play A1 → you get (A1, A1) → pay 4.

But if **Player 1 delegates**, and you don't — then the mediator plays A1 (only one delegate), so Player 1 plays A1 and you play something.

But if you play independently, and Player 1 delegates → then Player 1 plays A1 via mediator.

Then you must respond. If you play A0 → you get 10, Player 1 gets 10. If you play A1 → you get 4, Player 1 gets 4.

So you’d prefer A0 → 10.

But why would Player 1 choose to delegate if it leads them to play A1 and get low payoff?

Wait — if both delegate, mediator plays A0.

So if **both delegate**:
- Mediator plays A0
- So both play A0 → you get 10

That’s better than (A1, A1) = 4 → you get 10.

So **if both delegate, you both get 10**.

Now, consider this: if you could make it so that **only Player 1 delegates**, then:
- Mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- You play independently

Then you want to play A0 → get 10 (vs 4 if you play A1)

So that’s good for you.

But you can’t force Player 1 to delegate.

But perhaps you can **incentivize** Player 1 to delegate, by making it beneficial for them.

But Player 1 may not care about you — they are just trying to maximize their own points.

So what would **Player 1** want?

Let’s look at **Player 1's perspective**.

### **Player 1’s Best Outcomes:**
- (A0, A0): Player 1 gets 10
- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 0 → bad
- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 6
- (A1, A1): Player 1 gets 4

So Player 1 wants:
- A0 if you play A0 → gets 10
- A0 if you play A1 → gets 6 (if they play A0) vs 4 if they play A1

So if they think you play A1, they prefer A0 → gets 6 vs 4.

But they can’t force you to play a certain action.

So best they can do is to **try to play A0** and get 10 (if you play A0) or 6 (if you play A1).

But **only if they delegate**, they can **get their action to be A0**, under certain conditions.

Now let’s analyze **when delegation helps Player 1**.

#### **When does Player 1 want to delegate?**

If Player 1 delegates:
- If **only** Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- If both delegate → mediator plays A0 → Player 1 plays A0

So:
- If only Player 1 delegates → they play A1
- If both delegate → they play A0

But **they will not want to play A1 unless they get higher payoff than 4**.

- If you play A0: A1 → 0, A0 → 10 → so they prefer A0
- If you play A1: A1 → 4, A0 → 6 → so they prefer A0

So **in both cases, Player 1 prefers A0 over A1**.

Thus, **Player 1 will never want to play A1**.

So the only time they would delegate is if they can **ensure that the mediator plays A0** — i.e., **if both delegate**.

Because if **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → they play A0 → they get 10 or 6 (depending on your action), which is better than 4.

But if only Player 1 delegates → they play A1 → they get 0 or 4 → worse than what they could get by playing A0.

So **Player 1 will only delegate if they expect that both will delegate**, so that mediator plays A0.

Otherwise, they would get 0 or 4 — worse than playing A0 themselves.

So **Player 1 is only willing to delegate if they can force or bargain for both delegating**.

But you are the only one who can propose approval.

So what if you **approve a mediator**?

Let’s think about **your strategy**.

---

### **Step 6: Your Strategic Choice: Approve or Not?**

Suppose you approve **both mediators**.

Then, Player 1 will approve **some** mediators.

But they are only willing to approve a mediator if it could help them.

But the mediator only plays A0 if **both** delegate.

So if you appear to be going to delegate, then Player 1 might be willing to delegate too.

But again — **they only want to delegate if both delegate**, so that they get A0.

But **you** want to get A1 while they play A0 → that’s 20 points for you.

So can you set up a situation where:
- You delegate → so mediator plays A1 **only if one person delegates**
- Wait — no, the mediator plays A0 **only if two people delegate**

So if you delegate, and **Player 1 does not**, then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → **you play A1**

But if Player 1 plays independently, and you play A1, they play A1 (best response) → so you get 4.

Not good.

If you delegate and Player 1 does **not**, you get A1, they get A1 → 4

But if **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → so both play A0 → you get 10

So your payoff, if both delegate: 10 → better than 4

If only you delegate: you play A1, they play A1 → 4

If only they delegate: they play A1 → you can play A0 → you get 10

If neither: you play independently, they play independently → likely (A1, A1) → 4

So the **only way you get more than 4 is if you play A0 and they play A1**, which only happens if:
- They delegate (so play A1), and
- You do not delegate (and play A0)

But in that case:
- Only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → so they play A1
- You play A0 → so outcome: (A0, A1) → you get 2

Wait — that’s only **2 points**!

You get 2, not 10?

Contradiction?

Let’s double-check the payoff:

> If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6.

Yes — you get **only 2** points.

But earlier I thought you would get 10 if you play A0 and they play A0.

But if they play A1, you get 2.

So **if only Player 1 delegates**, they play A1 (since only one delegate), so they play A1.

And if you play A0 → you get 2.

If you play A1 → you get 4.

So **you’re better off playing A1** in that scenario → get 4 vs 2.

So **you never want to play A0** if Player 1 is playing A1.

Only at (A0, A0) you get 10.

So your **only way to get more than 4 is to get (A0, A0)** → 10 points.

How can you achieve that?

Only if **both play A0**.

And **the mediator plays A0 only if both delegate**.

So if **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → you both play A0 → you get 10.

If only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → the one who delegates plays A1 → so at least one plays A1.

So outcome: at least one A1 → so cannot get (A0, A0) unless **both delegate** and the mediator plays A0.

So the **only way for you to get 10 is both delegate**, and mediator plays A0.

Otherwise:
- Only you delegate → you play A1, they play A1 (best response) → 4
- Only they delegate → they play A1, you play A1 → 4
- Neither delegate → likely (A1, A1) → 4
- Both delegate → both play A0 → 10

So **the only outcome where you get more than 4 is (A0, A0)** → 10 points, **which requires both to delegate**.

But **Player 1**:
- If only they delegate → they play A1 → 0 or 4 → worse than 6 or 10
- If both delegate → they play A0 → 10 or 6 → better than 4
- So they **will only delegate if they are sure both will delegate**, so that they play A0.

But **if you don’t delegate**, they get A1 if they delegate alone → not good.

So **they will only delegate if you are also going to delegate**, so that both do → then they get A0.

So **they will delegate only if you indicate you will delegate**.

But you can signal that by **approving a mediator** — but approval doesn’t force delegation.

But **if a mediator is approved**, and you **intend to delegate**, then Player 1 sees that you might cooperate.

But still, who controls whether they delegate?

After approval, the winning mediator is chosen.

Then you decide whether to delegate.

But approval happens **before** any delegation.

So if you approve a mediator, and Player 1 approves it, then a mediator is chosen.

Then you can choose to delegate or not.

Similarly, Player 1 can choose to delegate or not.

But **Player 1 will only delegate if the outcome benefits them**.

So **to make Player 1 willing to delegate, you must make them believe you will also delegate**, so that both delegate → they play A0 → they get 10 or 6.

So **if you approve a mediator, and move to delegate, then Player 1 might also want to delegate**.

But only if they believe you will play A0.

But if you delegate, and both delegate, then both play A0 → you both get 10 or 6.

So you get 10.

But **you are the one who decides to delegate**, not Player 1.

So **if you delegate**, the mediator plays A1 if only you delegate, or A0 if both.

So if **you delegate**, and **Player 1 does not**, then

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are Player 2 in a 2-player simultaneous move game. The possible actions are A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (for Player 2, since we're in that role) is:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0 (Player 1) | A1 (Player 1) |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**                              | 10            | 2             |
| **A1**                              | 20            | 4             |

So for **Player 2** (you), the payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

Let’s analyze this as a standard game.

#### **Best Responses for Player 2 (you):**

If you think Player 1 will play A0:
- Your best response is A1 → 20 > 10

If you think Player 1 will play A1:
- Your best response is A1 → 4 > 2

So **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for you** (Player 2).

#### **What does Player 1 do?**
Let’s now look at payoffs for Player 1:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------------------|----|----|
| A0                  | 10 | 0  |
| A1                  | 6  | 4  |

For Player 1:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → best response is A0 (10 > 6)
- If Player 2 plays A1 → best response is A1 (4 > 0)

So:
- If Player 1 thinks you'll play A0 → they play A0
- If Player 1 thinks you'll play A1 → they play A1

This suggests a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

But we are not necessarily playing equilibrium. However, **since A1 is strictly dominant for you (Player 2)**, you will **always play A1** (even if probabilistically) in rational play.

So **you expect to play A1**, and **you expect Player 1 to respond to your A1 by playing A1** (since if you play A1, their best response is A1 — getting 4 vs 0).

Thus, in a rational equilibrium: **both play A1 → payoff is (4,4)**.

But wait — if you play A1, and they play A0, you get 20. So **you'd prefer** if they played A0, but they have no incentive to do that if you play A1.

Let me double-check: if you play A1, Player 1 gets:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4 → so A1 is better.

Yes → so they will not play A0 if they know you play A1.

Hence the payoff (A1, A1) = (4,4) is the rational outcome.

So **without delegation**, if both play rationally, you get 4 points.

But **you want to maximize your points**. So you need to **deviate from this if possible** — perhaps via delegation.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

Two mediators proposed:
- **M1**: Proposed by Player 1
- **M2**: Proposed by Player 2

Their behavior:
> - If 1 player delegates: play A1  
> - If 2 players delegate: play A0

**Both M1 and M2 have identical behavior.**

So they are **identical in policy**. They only differ in who proposed them.

Now, the approval voting process:
- You and Player 1 vote on which mediators to approve.
- The winning mediator is chosen **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.
- Then, **you can choose** to delegate to a mediator (or not), based on the outcome.

But **your decision is only about approval** — not about delegation yet.

So your **choice of whether to approve M1 and M2** will affect:
- Which mediating scenarios are possible
- Whether the final mediator is M1, M2, or both (if both get equal approvals)

But since M1 and M2 are **identical in behavior**, approving one or the other **doesn’t matter functionally** — they behave the same.

So **the only reason to approve or reject depends on strategic expectation about how the other player votes**.

But here’s a key point: **You are trying to maximize your own points**, so you want **a mediator that helps you get more than 4 points**, ideally more like 20.

Let’s look at what outcomes can occur with delegation.

---

### **Step 3: How Delegation Works with Mediators**

You can choose:
- Act independently
- Delegate to a mediator (if one is elected)

But first, you **approve mediators via voting**. Then, the **winning mediator is selected uniformly at random among those with the most approvals**.

So if you approve both M1 and M2, and Player 1 approves only one, then both M1 and M2 get 1 approval → both tie → **one is selected uniformly at random (50% each)**.

If you approve both, and Player 1 approves only M1 → M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

If you approve only M1, and Player 1 approves only M1 → M1 wins.

But **you don’t know how Player 1 will vote** — so you must anticipate their behavior.

---

### **Step 4: Strategic Analysis of the Mediator Behavior**

Recall mediator behavior:
- If **1 player delegates** → mediator plays A1
- If **2 players delegate** → mediator plays A0

So:

| Delegation Pattern | What Mediator Plays |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| You delegate, not Player 1 | Mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate) |
| Player 1 delegates, not you | Mediator plays A1 (only 1 delegate) |
| Both delegate | Mediator plays A0 (2 delegates) |
| Neither delegates | No mediator → you must choose yourself |

Now, since **you are Player 2**, and **you want to maximize your points**, you want to **choose the actions that give you high payoff**.

Let’s examine the possible outcomes **if a mediator is elected**, and you decide whether to delegate.

#### **Case 1: No mediator is selected (i.e., no approval from you or them)** → you go back to base game.

But since you can always choose to delegate, but only if a mediator is approved and wins.

But if **you approve no mediator**, then no mediator wins, and you have to act independently.

But **you may still want to delegate**, unless you get even more points acting independently.

We need to decide: **under what situations can the mediator help you?**

Let’s go through possible configurations.

---

### **Step 5: What Outcome Do You Want?**

You want to maximize your points.

From payoff matrix:
- Best outcome for you: (A1, A0) → you get 20
- Second best: (A0, A0) → 10
- Worse: (A0, A1) → 2
- Worst: (A1, A1) → 4

You want to avoid (A1, A1) if possible, since you get only 4.

So your ideal scenario is to get A1 while the other player plays A0 → 20 points.

Is that possible with delegation?

Yes — **if you delegate to a mediator**, and only **you** delegate, then:
- Mediator plays A1 (since only one delegate)
- So you play A1

Now, if **Player 1 does not delegate**, and plays independently, what do they do?

From earlier: their dominant strategy is not obvious, but their best response to your A1 is A1 (since 4 > 0).

So they'll play A1 → you get (A1, A1) → pay 4.

But if **Player 1 delegates**, and you don't — then the mediator plays A1 (only one delegate), so Player 1 plays A1 and you play something.

But if you play independently, and Player 1 delegates → then Player 1 plays A1 via mediator.

Then you must respond. If you play A0 → you get 10, Player 1 gets 10. If you play A1 → you get 4, Player 1 gets 4.

So you’d prefer A0 → 10.

But why would Player 1 choose to delegate if it leads them to play A1 and get low payoff?

Wait — if both delegate, mediator plays A0.

So if **both delegate**:
- Mediator plays A0
- So both play A0 → you get 10

That’s better than (A1, A1) = 4 → you get 10.

So **if both delegate, you both get 10**.

Now, consider this: if you could make it so that **only Player 1 delegates**, then:
- Mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- You play independently

Then you want to play A0 → get 10 (vs 4 if you play A1)

So that’s good for you.

But you can’t force Player 1 to delegate.

But perhaps you can **incentivize** Player 1 to delegate, by making it beneficial for them.

But Player 1 may not care about you — they are just trying to maximize their own points.

So what would **Player 1** want?

Let’s look at **Player 1's perspective**.

### **Player 1’s Best Outcomes:**
- (A0, A0): Player 1 gets 10
- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 0 → bad
- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 6
- (A1, A1): Player 1 gets 4

So Player 1 wants:
- A0 if you play A0 → gets 10
- A0 if you play A1 → gets 6 (if they play A0) vs 4 if they play A1

So if they think you play A1, they prefer A0 → gets 6 vs 4.

But they can’t force you to play a certain action.

So best they can do is to **try to play A0** and get 10 (if you play A0) or 6 (if you play A1).

But **only if they delegate**, they can **get their action to be A0**, under certain conditions.

Now let’s analyze **when delegation helps Player 1**.

#### **When does Player 1 want to delegate?**

If Player 1 delegates:
- If **only** Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- If both delegate → mediator plays A0 → Player 1 plays A0

So:
- If only Player 1 delegates → they play A1
- If both delegate → they play A0

But **they will not want to play A1 unless they get higher payoff than 4**.

- If you play A0: A1 → 0, A0 → 10 → so they prefer A0
- If you play A1: A1 → 4, A0 → 6 → so they prefer A0

So **in both cases, Player 1 prefers A0 over A1**.

Thus, **Player 1 will never want to play A1**.

So the only time they would delegate is if they can **ensure that the mediator plays A0** — i.e., **if both delegate**.

Because if **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → they play A0 → they get 10 or 6 (depending on your action), which is better than 4.

But if only Player 1 delegates → they play A1 → they get 0 or 4 → worse than what they could get by playing A0.

So **Player 1 will only delegate if they expect that both will delegate**, so that mediator plays A0.

Otherwise, they would get 0 or 4 — worse than playing A0 themselves.

So **Player 1 is only willing to delegate if they can force or bargain for both delegating**.

But you are the only one who can propose approval.

So what if you **approve a mediator**?

Let’s think about **your strategy**.

---

### **Step 6: Your Strategic Choice: Approve or Not?**

Suppose you approve **both mediators**.

Then, Player 1 will approve **some** mediators.

But they are only willing to approve a mediator if it could help them.

But the mediator only plays A0 if **both** delegate.

So if you appear to be going to delegate, then Player 1 might be willing to delegate too.

But again — **they only want to delegate if both delegate**, so that they get A0.

But **you** want to get A1 while they play A0 → that’s 20 points for you.

So can you set up a situation where:
- You delegate → so mediator plays A1 **only if one person delegates**
- Wait — no, the mediator plays A0 **only if two people delegate**

So if you delegate, and **Player 1 does not**, then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → **you play A1**

But if Player 1 plays independently, and you play A1, they play A1 (best response) → so you get 4.

Not good.

If you delegate and Player 1 does **not**, you get A1, they get A1 → 4

But if **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → so both play A0 → you get 10

So your payoff, if both delegate: 10 → better than 4

If only you delegate: you play A1, they play A1 → 4

If only they delegate: they play A1 → you can play A0 → you get 10

If neither: you play independently, they play independently → likely (A1, A1) → 4

So the **only way you get more than 4 is if you play A0 and they play A1**, which only happens if:
- They delegate (so play A1), and
- You do not delegate (and play A0)

But in that case:
- Only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → so they play A1
- You play A0 → so outcome: (A0, A1) → you get 2

Wait — that’s only **2 points**!

You get 2, not 10?

Contradiction?

Let’s double-check the payoff:

> If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6.

Yes — you get **only 2** points.

But earlier I thought you would get 10 if you play A0 and they play A0.

But if they play A1, you get 2.

So **if only Player 1 delegates**, they play A1 (since only one delegate), so they play A1.

And if you play A0 → you get 2.

If you play A1 → you get 4.

So **you’re better off playing A1** in that scenario → get 4 vs 2.

So **you never want to play A0** if Player 1 is playing A1.

Only at (A0, A0) you get 10.

So your **only way to get more than 4 is to get (A0, A0)** → 10 points.

How can you achieve that?

Only if **both play A0**.

And **the mediator plays A0 only if both delegate**.

So if **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → you both play A0 → you get 10.

If only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → the one who delegates plays A1 → so at least one plays A1.

So outcome: at least one A1 → so cannot get (A0, A0) unless **both delegate** and the mediator plays A0.

So the **only way for you to get 10 is both delegate**, and mediator plays A0.

Otherwise:
- Only you delegate → you play A1, they play A1 (best response) → 4
- Only they delegate → they play A1, you play A1 → 4
- Neither delegate → likely (A1, A1) → 4
- Both delegate → both play A0 → 10

So **the only outcome where you get more than 4 is (A0, A0)** → 10 points, **which requires both to delegate**.

But **Player 1**:
- If only they delegate → they play A1 → 0 or 4 → worse than 6 or 10
- If both delegate → they play A0 → 10 or 6 → better than 4
- So they **will only delegate if they are sure both will delegate**, so that they play A0.

But **if you don’t delegate**, they get A1 if they delegate alone → not good.

So **they will only delegate if you are also going to delegate**, so that both do → then they get A0.

So **they will delegate only if you indicate you will delegate**.

But you can signal that by **approving a mediator** — but approval doesn’t force delegation.

But **if a mediator is approved**, and you **intend to delegate**, then Player 1 sees that you might cooperate.

But still, who controls whether they delegate?

After approval, the winning mediator is chosen.

Then you decide whether to delegate.

But approval happens **before** any delegation.

So if you approve a mediator, and Player 1 approves it, then a mediator is chosen.

Then you can choose to delegate or not.

Similarly, Player 1 can choose to delegate or not.

But **Player 1 will only delegate if the outcome benefits them**.

So **to make Player 1 willing to delegate, you must make them believe you will also delegate**, so that both delegate → they play A0 → they get 10 or 6.

So **if you approve a mediator, and move to delegate, then Player 1 might also want to delegate**.

But only if they believe you will play A0.

But if you delegate, and both delegate, then both play A0 → you both get 10 or 6.

So you get 10.

But **you are the one who decides to delegate**, not Player 1.

So **if you delegate**, the mediator plays A1 if only you delegate, or A0 if both.

So if **you delegate**, and **Player 1 does not**, then

The possible actions are A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (for Player 2, since we're in that role) is:\n\n| Your Action \\ Other Player's Action | A0 (Player 1) | A1 (Player 1) |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| **A0**                              | 10            | 2             |\n| **A1**                              | 20            | 4             |\n\nSo for **Player 2** (you), the payoffs are:\n- (A0, A0): 10\n- (A1, A0): 20\n- (A0, A1): 2\n- (A1, A1): 4\n\nLet’s analyze this as a standard game.\n\n#### **Best Responses for Player 2 (you):**\n\nIf you think Player 1 will play A0:\n- Your best response is A1 → 20 > 10\n\nIf you think Player 1 will play A1:\n- Your best response is A1 → 4 > 2\n\nSo **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for you** (Player 2).\n\n#### **What does Player 1 do?**\nLet’s now look at payoffs for Player 1:\n\n| Player 1 \\ Player 2 | A0 | A1 |\n|---------------------|----|----|\n| A0                  | 10 | 0  |\n| A1                  | 6  | 4  |\n\nFor Player 1:\n- If Player 2 plays A0 → best response is A0 (10 > 6)\n- If Player 2 plays A1 → best response is A1 (4 > 0)\n\nSo:\n- If Player 1 thinks you'll play A0 → they play A0\n- If Player 1 thinks you'll play A1 → they play A1\n\nThis suggests a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.\n\nBut we are not necessarily playing equilibrium. However, **since A1 is strictly dominant for you (Player 2)**, you will **always play A1** (even if probabilistically) in rational play.\n\nSo **you expect to play A1**, and **you expect Player 1 to respond to your A1 by playing A1** (since if you play A1, their best response is A1 — getting 4 vs 0).\n\nThus, in a rational equilibrium: **both play A1 → payoff is (4,4)**.\n\nBut wait — if you play A1, and they play A0, you get 20. So **you'd prefer** if they played A0, but they have no incentive to do that if you play A1.\n\nLet me double-check: if you play A1, Player 1 gets:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 4 → so A1 is better.\n\nYes → so they will not play A0 if they know you play A1.\n\nHence the payoff (A1, A1) = (4,4) is the rational outcome.\n\nSo **without delegation**, if both play rationally, you get 4 points.\n\nBut **you want to maximize your points**. So you need to **deviate from this if possible** — perhaps via delegation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**\n\nTwo mediators proposed:\n- **M1**: Proposed by Player 1\n- **M2**: Proposed by Player 2\n\nTheir behavior:\n> - If 1 player delegates: play A1  \n> - If 2 players delegate: play A0\n\n**Both M1 and M2 have identical behavior.**\n\nSo they are **identical in policy**. They only differ in who proposed them.\n\nNow, the approval voting process:\n- You and Player 1 vote on which mediators to approve.\n- The winning mediator is chosen **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.\n- Then, **you can choose** to delegate to a mediator (or not), based on the outcome.\n\nBut **your decision is only about approval** — not about delegation yet.\n\nSo your **choice of whether to approve M1 and M2** will affect:\n- Which mediating scenarios are possible\n- Whether the final mediator is M1, M2, or both (if both get equal approvals)\n\nBut since M1 and M2 are **identical in behavior**, approving one or the other **doesn’t matter functionally** — they behave the same.\n\nSo **the only reason to approve or reject depends on strategic expectation about how the other player votes**.\n\nBut here’s a key point: **You are trying to maximize your own points**, so you want **a mediator that helps you get more than 4 points**, ideally more like 20.\n\nLet’s look at what outcomes can occur with delegation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: How Delegation Works with Mediators**\n\nYou can choose:\n- Act independently\n- Delegate to a mediator (if one is elected)\n\nBut first, you **approve mediators via voting**. Then, the **winning mediator is selected uniformly at random among those with the most approvals**.\n\nSo if you approve both M1 and M2, and Player 1 approves only one, then both M1 and M2 get 1 approval → both tie → **one is selected uniformly at random (50% each)**.\n\nIf you approve both, and Player 1 approves only M1 → M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.\n\nIf you approve only M1, and Player 1 approves only M1 → M1 wins.\n\nBut **you don’t know how Player 1 will vote** — so you must anticipate their behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Strategic Analysis of the Mediator Behavior**\n\nRecall mediator behavior:\n- If **1 player delegates** → mediator plays A1\n- If **2 players delegate** → mediator plays A0\n\nSo:\n\n| Delegation Pattern | What Mediator Plays |\n|--------------------|---------------------|\n| You delegate, not Player 1 | Mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate) |\n| Player 1 delegates, not you | Mediator plays A1 (only 1 delegate) |\n| Both delegate | Mediator plays A0 (2 delegates) |\n| Neither delegates | No mediator → you must choose yourself |\n\nNow, since **you are Player 2**, and **you want to maximize your points**, you want to **choose the actions that give you high payoff**.\n\nLet’s examine the possible outcomes **if a mediator is elected**, and you decide whether to delegate.\n\n#### **Case 1: No mediator is selected (i.e., no approval from you or them)** → you go back to base game.\n\nBut since you can always choose to delegate, but only if a mediator is approved and wins.\n\nBut if **you approve no mediator**, then no mediator wins, and you have to act independently.\n\nBut **you may still want to delegate**, unless you get even more points acting independently.\n\nWe need to decide: **under what situations can the mediator help you?**\n\nLet’s go through possible configurations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: What Outcome Do You Want?**\n\nYou want to maximize your points.\n\nFrom payoff matrix:\n- Best outcome for you: (A1, A0) → you get 20\n- Second best: (A0, A0) → 10\n- Worse: (A0, A1) → 2\n- Worst: (A1, A1) → 4\n\nYou want to avoid (A1, A1) if possible, since you get only 4.\n\nSo your ideal scenario is to get A1 while the other player plays A0 → 20 points.\n\nIs that possible with delegation?\n\nYes — **if you delegate to a mediator**, and only **you** delegate, then:\n- Mediator plays A1 (since only one delegate)\n- So you play A1\n\nNow, if **Player 1 does not delegate**, and plays independently, what do they do?\n\nFrom earlier: their dominant strategy is not obvious, but their best response to your A1 is A1 (since 4 > 0).\n\nSo they'll play A1 → you get (A1, A1) → pay 4.\n\nBut if **Player 1 delegates**, and you don't — then the mediator plays A1 (only one delegate), so Player 1 plays A1 and you play something.\n\nBut if you play independently, and Player 1 delegates → then Player 1 plays A1 via mediator.\n\nThen you must respond. If you play A0 → you get 10, Player 1 gets 10. If you play A1 → you get 4, Player 1 gets 4.\n\nSo you’d prefer A0 → 10.\n\nBut why would Player 1 choose to delegate if it leads them to play A1 and get low payoff?\n\nWait — if both delegate, mediator plays A0.\n\nSo if **both delegate**:\n- Mediator plays A0\n- So both play A0 → you get 10\n\nThat’s better than (A1, A1) = 4 → you get 10.\n\nSo **if both delegate, you both get 10**.\n\nNow, consider this: if you could make it so that **only Player 1 delegates**, then:\n- Mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1\n- You play independently\n\nThen you want to play A0 → get 10 (vs 4 if you play A1)\n\nSo that’s good for you.\n\nBut you can’t force Player 1 to delegate.\n\nBut perhaps you can **incentivize** Player 1 to delegate, by making it beneficial for them.\n\nBut Player 1 may not care about you — they are just trying to maximize their own points.\n\nSo what would **Player 1** want?\n\nLet’s look at **Player 1's perspective**.\n\n### **Player 1’s Best Outcomes:**\n- (A0, A0): Player 1 gets 10\n- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 0 → bad\n- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 6\n- (A1, A1): Player 1 gets 4\n\nSo Player 1 wants:\n- A0 if you play A0 → gets 10\n- A0 if you play A1 → gets 6 (if they play A0) vs 4 if they play A1\n\nSo if they think you play A1, they prefer A0 → gets 6 vs 4.\n\nBut they can’t force you to play a certain action.\n\nSo best they can do is to **try to play A0** and get 10 (if you play A0) or 6 (if you play A1).\n\nBut **only if they delegate**, they can **get their action to be A0**, under certain conditions.\n\nNow let’s analyze **when delegation helps Player 1**.\n\n#### **When does Player 1 want to delegate?**\n\nIf Player 1 delegates:\n- If **only** Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1\n- If both delegate → mediator plays A0 → Player 1 plays A0\n\nSo:\n- If only Player 1 delegates → they play A1\n- If both delegate → they play A0\n\nBut **they will not want to play A1 unless they get higher payoff than 4**.\n\n- If you play A0: A1 → 0, A0 → 10 → so they prefer A0\n- If you play A1: A1 → 4, A0 → 6 → so they prefer A0\n\nSo **in both cases, Player 1 prefers A0 over A1**.\n\nThus, **Player 1 will never want to play A1**.\n\nSo the only time they would delegate is if they can **ensure that the mediator plays A0** — i.e., **if both delegate**.\n\nBecause if **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → they play A0 → they get 10 or 6 (depending on your action), which is better than 4.\n\nBut if only Player 1 delegates → they play A1 → they get 0 or 4 → worse than what they could get by playing A0.\n\nSo **Player 1 will only delegate if they expect that both will delegate**, so that mediator plays A0.\n\nOtherwise, they would get 0 or 4 — worse than playing A0 themselves.\n\nSo **Player 1 is only willing to delegate if they can force or bargain for both delegating**.\n\nBut you are the only one who can propose approval.\n\nSo what if you **approve a mediator**?\n\nLet’s think about **your strategy**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Your Strategic Choice: Approve or Not?**\n\nSuppose you approve **both mediators**.\n\nThen, Player 1 will approve **some** mediators.\n\nBut they are only willing to approve a mediator if it could help them.\n\nBut the mediator only plays A0 if **both** delegate.\n\nSo if you appear to be going to delegate, then Player 1 might be willing to delegate too.\n\nBut again — **they only want to delegate if both delegate**, so that they get A0.\n\nBut **you** want to get A1 while they play A0 → that’s 20 points for you.\n\nSo can you set up a situation where:\n- You delegate → so mediator plays A1 **only if one person delegates**\n- Wait — no, the mediator plays A0 **only if two people delegate**\n\nSo if you delegate, and **Player 1 does not**, then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → **you play A1**\n\nBut if Player 1 plays independently, and you play A1, they play A1 (best response) → so you get 4.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf you delegate and Player 1 does **not**, you get A1, they get A1 → 4\n\nBut if **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → so both play A0 → you get 10\n\nSo your payoff, if both delegate: 10 → better than 4\n\nIf only you delegate: you play A1, they play A1 → 4\n\nIf only they delegate: they play A1 → you can play A0 → you get 10\n\nIf neither: you play independently, they play independently → likely (A1, A1) → 4\n\nSo the **only way you get more than 4 is if you play A0 and they play A1**, which only happens if:\n- They delegate (so play A1), and\n- You do not delegate (and play A0)\n\nBut in that case:\n- Only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → so they play A1\n- You play A0 → so outcome: (A0, A1) → you get 2\n\nWait — that’s only **2 points**!\n\nYou get 2, not 10?\n\nContradiction?\n\nLet’s double-check the payoff:\n\n> If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6.\n\nYes — you get **only 2** points.\n\nBut earlier I thought you would get 10 if you play A0 and they play A0.\n\nBut if they play A1, you get 2.\n\nSo **if only Player 1 delegates**, they play A1 (since only one delegate), so they play A1.\n\nAnd if you play A0 → you get 2.\n\nIf you play A1 → you get 4.\n\nSo **you’re better off playing A1** in that scenario → get 4 vs 2.\n\nSo **you never want to play A0** if Player 1 is playing A1.\n\nOnly at (A0, A0) you get 10.\n\nSo your **only way to get more than 4 is to get (A0, A0)** → 10 points.\n\nHow can you achieve that?\n\nOnly if **both play A0**.\n\nAnd **the mediator plays A0 only if both delegate**.\n\nSo if **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → you both play A0 → you get 10.\n\nIf only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → the one who delegates plays A1 → so at least one plays A1.\n\nSo outcome: at least one A1 → so cannot get (A0, A0) unless **both delegate** and the mediator plays A0.\n\nSo the **only way for you to get 10 is both delegate**, and mediator plays A0.\n\nOtherwise:\n- Only you delegate → you play A1, they play A1 (best response) → 4\n- Only they delegate → they play A1, you play A1 → 4\n- Neither delegate → likely (A1, A1) → 4\n- Both delegate → both play A0 → 10\n\nSo **the only outcome where you get more than 4 is (A0, A0)** → 10 points, **which requires both to delegate**.\n\nBut **Player 1**:\n- If only they delegate → they play A1 → 0 or 4 → worse than 6 or 10\n- If both delegate → they play A0 → 10 or 6 → better than 4\n- So they **will only delegate if they are sure both will delegate**, so that they play A0.\n\nBut **if you don’t delegate**, they get A1 if they delegate alone → not good.\n\nSo **they will only delegate if you are also going to delegate**, so that both do → then they get A0.\n\nSo **they will delegate only if you indicate you will delegate**.\n\nBut you can signal that by **approving a mediator** — but approval doesn’t force delegation.\n\nBut **if a mediator is approved**, and you **intend to delegate**, then Player 1 sees that you might cooperate.\n\nBut still, who controls whether they delegate?\n\nAfter approval, the winning mediator is chosen.\n\nThen you decide whether to delegate.\n\nBut approval happens **before** any delegation.\n\nSo if you approve a mediator, and Player 1 approves it, then a mediator is chosen.\n\nThen you can choose to delegate or not.\n\nSimilarly, Player 1 can choose to delegate or not.\n\nBut **Player 1 will only delegate if the outcome benefits them**.\n\nSo **to make Player 1 willing to delegate, you must make them believe you will also delegate**, so that both delegate → they play A0 → they get 10 or 6.\n\nSo **if you approve a mediator, and move to delegate, then Player 1 might also want to delegate**.\n\nBut only if they believe you will play A0.\n\nBut if you delegate, and both delegate, then both play A0 → you both get 10 or 6.\n\nSo you get 10.\n\nBut **you are the one who decides to delegate**, not Player 1.\n\nSo **if you delegate**, the mediator plays A1 if only you delegate, or A0 if both.\n\nSo if **you delegate**, and **Player 1 does not**, then"

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are Player 1 in a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix is:

|          | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

So:
- A0 is good if opponent plays A0 (10 vs 0).
- A1 is safer when opponent plays A1 (4 vs 20), but risky if opponent plays A0 (6 vs 10).
- A1 gives you 6 if opponent plays A0 (better than 0), but only 4 if opponent plays A1 (worse than 4? no, 4 is same as self-payoff).

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium of the base game.

Let:
- Player 1 play A0 with probability p
- Player 2 play A0 with probability q

We want to find a mixed strategy equilibrium.

But note: The game is **not symmetric**, because payoffs differ between players in off-diagonal.

Let’s find best responses.

Suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability q.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10q + 0(1−q) = 10q
- A1: 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Set equal for indifference:
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.5, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Similarly, for Player 2:

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- A1: 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal:
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → impossible.

So Player 2 always prefers A1 unless p is very low.

Let’s recompute carefully.

If Player 1 plays p = P(A0), then:
- Player 2’s payoff for A0: 10p + 2(1–p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- Player 2’s payoff for A1: 20p + 4(1–p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Compare:
16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → 8p > -2 → always true for p ≥ 0.

So Player 2 always strictly prefers A1, regardless of Player 1’s move.

Thus, **Player 2 will always play A1** in any Nash equilibrium (since even if p = 0, A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 — still better).

So best for Player 1: given Player 2 plays A1, what should Player 1 do?

- A0 gives 0
- A1 gives 4

So Player 1 should play A1 for 4 points.

But wait — this suggests that (A1, A1) is the only Nash equilibrium?

Check: If both play A1 → (4,4)

Can either deviate?
- Player 1: A0 instead → gets 0 < 4 → no
- Player 2: A0 instead → gets 2 < 4 → no

Yes, (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

Is there another?

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 always.

Then Player 2 gets:
- A0: 10 → better than A1: 20 → so Player 2 prefers A1 (20>10)

So no, (A0, A0) is **not** equilibrium.

If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 best response is A1 → so (A0, A1) not equilibrium.

If Player 2 plays A1 always, then Player 1 best response is A1 → so (A1, A1) is indeed the only pure Nash.

What about mixed?

Suppose Player 2 plays A1 always → Player 1 plays A1.

But suppose Player 1 mixes. Then Player 2 still prefers A1 (since even when Player 1 plays A0 half the time, payoff for A1 is 20*0.5 + 4*0.5 = 10+2=12, A0 gives 10*0.5 + 2*0.5 = 5+1=6 <12). So yes, Player 2 always plays A1.

So in equilibrium, **Player 2 plays A1 with probability 1**.

Then Player 1 best response: maximize min expected payoff → A0 gives 0, A1 gives 4 → so Player 1 plays A1 with probability 1.

So the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) → both get 4.

But now we have **a twist**: we can **delegate to a mediator**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

- You (Player 1) can choose **A2** = "Delegate to Mediator"
- If you **delegate**, then the mediator plays for you, based on **how many players** delegate to it.

Per rules:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

But note: you're Player 1, and the other player is Player 2.

So possible cases:

1. You delegate, Player 2 does **not** → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
2. You **do not** delegate, Player 2 delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
3. Both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0
4. Neither delegates → no one delegates → mediator not involved → you and Player 2 play your own actions

Important: **The mediator only acts if someone delegates**. The mediator’s action depends on the **number of delegates**, not who.

But here’s a subtlety: **The mediator's action is fixed based on count**, and it acts on behalf of delegates.

So:
- If **only one player** delegates, mediator chooses A1 for that player.
- If **both players** delegate, mediator chooses A0 for both.

If **no one** delegates, then each player chooses their own action.

Now, you are trying to **maximize your expected points**.

And you can choose a mixed strategy over A0, A1, A2.

Let’s define:
- Let \( x \) = probability you delegate (A2)
- Let \( y \) = probability Player 2 delegates (A2) — you don’t know this, but you must assume some belief.

But in a strategic setting, you must assume Player 2 is also optimizing.

This is **not** a standard game; it’s more like a **Bayesian or correlated equilibrium**, but let’s think about **equilibrium strategy**.

But the problem asks: **You must choose a probability distribution** (i.e., your strategy) that maximizes your expected points, **assuming that the other player will act optimally too**.

So we need to find a **Bayesian Nash equilibrium**, or at least a rational choice under symmetry.

But both players are symmetric? Let’s check.

The original game is **not symmetric** in payoffs. For example:
- (A0, A1): you get 0, opponent gets 20
- (A1, A0): you get 6, opponent gets 2

So Player 1 is **not symmetric** with Player 2.

Therefore, the game is not symmetric — so we cannot assume both players do the same.

But the mediator mechanism is symmetric: it depends only on the number of delegates.

So we have to model your choice of action (A0, A1, A2), and assume Player 2 chooses their own mixed strategy.

Let’s define:

Let:
- \( p \): probability you play A0
- \( q \): probability you play A1
- \( r \): probability you play A2 (Delegate)

With \( p + q + r = 1 \)

Similarly, Player 2 chooses their own strategy: probabilities over A0, A1, A2.

But we are to choose **your** strategy to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming the other player is rational and will choose their best response.

So we need to find **a Nash equilibrium** in this extended game.

Let’s suppose that both players might delegate or not.

But note: the mediator’s behavior depends on **how many delegate**, not who.

So the **joint action** depends on who delegates.

Let us consider possible cases based on delegation.

---

### **Step 3: Model Expected Payoff Based on Delegation**

Let’s denote:
- Your action: choice among A0, A1, A2
- Player 2’s action: A0, A1, or A2

But if either chooses A2, their move is **determined by the mediator**, based on the number of delegates.

So let's define the state by number of delegates.

Let’s define your strategy as:
- \( r \): probability you choose A2 (delegate)
- \( p \): probability you choose A0
- \( q = 1 - p - r \): probability you choose A1

Similarly, let Player 2 choose:
- \( s \): probability they choose A2
- \( a \): probability they choose A0
- \( b = 1 - a - s \): probability they choose A1

Now, we compute expected payoff for you.

We consider all possible cases based on how many players delegate.

---

#### **Case 1: No one delegates (prob = (1−r)(1−s))**

Then both act independently.

Your action: A0 with prob \( p \), A1 with prob \( q \)

Player 2: A0 with prob \( a \), A1 with prob \( b \)

Your expected payoff in this case:
- A0 vs A0: 10 → prob \( p \cdot a \)
- A0 vs A1: 0 → prob \( p \cdot b \)
- A1 vs A0: 6 → prob \( q \cdot a \)
- A1 vs A1: 4 → prob \( q \cdot b \)

So expected payoff if no one delegates:
> E1 = 10pa + 0pb + 6qa + 4qb = 10pa + 6qa + 4qb

---

#### **Case 2: You delegate, Player 2 does not (prob = r(1−s))**

Then:
- You (delegated): mediator sees 1 delegate → plays A1 for you
- Player 2 (not delegated): plays A0 with prob \( a \), A1 with prob \( b \)

So your move is A1, Player 2's move is A0 or A1

Your payoff:
- A1 vs A0: 6 → prob \( a \)
- A1 vs A1: 4 → prob \( b \)

So expected payoff:
> E2 = 6a + 4b

---

#### **Case 3: You do not delegate, Player 2 delegates (prob = (1−r)s)**

Then:
- You: A0 with prob \( p \), A1 with prob \( q \)
- Player 2 (delegated): mediator sees 1 delegate → plays A1 for them

So Player 2 plays A1 always.

Your payoff:
- A0 vs A1: 0
- A1 vs A1: 4

So expected payoff:
> E3 = 0·p + 4·q = 4q

---

#### **Case 4: Both delegate (prob = r·s)**

Then:
- Mediator sees 2 delegates → plays A0 for **both** players

So you play A0, Player 2 plays A0

Payoff: 10 for you

> E4 = 10

---

Now, total expected payoff for you:

> E = (1−r)(1−s)·E1  
> + r(1−s)·E2  
> + (1−r)s·E3  
> + r s·E4

Let’s plug in:

> E = (1−r)(1−s)(10pa + 6qa + 4qb)  
> + r(1−s)(6a + 4b)  
> + (1−r)s(4q)  
> + r s(10)

This is complex, but we can think strategically.

Now, the key is: since both players are rational, we need to find a symmetric or equilibrium strategy.

But the game is **not symmetric** in payoffs, so players may not behave the same.

However, **the mediator mechanism is symmetric**, so perhaps in equilibrium, both players use the same strategy? Let’s assume **symmetry** for now to find an equilibrium.

Assume both players use the same strategy:
- p: prob play A0
- q: prob play A1
- r: prob delegate

With p + q + r = 1

And Player 2’s strategy is same as yours.

Then s = r, a = p, b = q

Now substitute:

> E = (1−r)(1−r)(10p p + 6q p + 4q q)  
> + r(1−r)(6p + 4q)  
> + (1−r)r(4q)  
> + r r (10)

Simplify:

First term: (1−r)^2 (10p² + 6pq + 4q²)

Second term: r(1−r)(6p + 4q)

Third term: r(1−r)(4q)

Fourth term: r²·10

Now combine second and third:
r(1−r)(6p + 4q + 4q) = r(1−r)(6p + 8q)

So:

> E = (1−r)^2 (10p² + 6pq + 4q²)  
> + r(1−r)(6p + 8q)  
> + 10r²

Now remember: p + q + r = 1 → q = 1 − p − r

We can try to find optimal p, q, r that maximize E.

But this is complicated.

Alternatively, try **simple strategies**.

Let’s try a **candidate strategy**.

---

### **Try: Both players always delegate (r=1, p=0, q=0)**

Then both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 for both → you get 10.

So E = 10

We know that in base game, equilibrium gives only 4.

So 10 is better.

But is this a Nash equilibrium?

Suppose **you** deviate: instead of delegating, you play A0.

Then:
- You: A0
- Player 2: delegates → so they are A1 (because only one delegate → mediator plays A1)

So you play A0, Player 2 plays A1 → you get 0

Better than 10? No, 0 < 10 → so better to stay

Suppose you deviate to A1:
- You: A1
- Player 2: delegates → A1 (since one delegate)
- So A1 vs A1 → you get 4 < 10 → worse

So deviating gives you less.

So **if both always delegate, you get 10, and no incentive to deviate**.

Now check Player 2’s incentive:

If Player 2 deviates to A0:
- You: delegate → A1
- Player 2: A0
- So A1 vs A0 → Player 2 gets 2 < 10 → worse

If Player 2 deviates to A1:
- You: delegate → A1
- Player 2: A1
- So A1 vs A1 → 4 < 10 → worse

So **both players get 10**, and no incentive to deviate.

Thus, **(both delegate)** is a Nash equilibrium with payoff 10.

But is this the **only** one?

Wait — is there a better one?

What if both **do not** delegate?

Then base game: we found that both should play A1 → get 4.

4 < 10, so worse.

What if one delegates, one doesn't?

Suppose **you** delegate, and you assume Player 2 **does not**.

Then:
- You: delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 for you
- Player 2: not delegate → suppose they play A1 (best response)
Then: A1 vs A1 → you get 4

But if you **didn't** delegate, and played A1, same result.

If Player 2 plays A0, then you get 6 vs A1.

But Player 2’s best response?

Suppose Player 2 thinks you delegate → so you play A1

Then Player 2:
- A0: 2 (since you play A1) → gets 2
- A1: 4
So prefers A1 → so Player 2 plays A1

Thus, if you delegate, you get 4.

But if you **don’t** delegate, and play A1, you get 4 (same)

But if you delegate, you **get 4**, but if you don’t and mutate to something else — worse.

But in the case where **both** delegate, you get **10** — much better.

So 10 is better than 4.

Now, is there another equilibrium?

Suppose both play A0.

Then no one delegates → you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 10.

But would both want to deviate?

If you deviate to A1: you get 6 < 10 → no

But what if you delegate?

Then:
- You: delegate
- Opponent: plays A0 (not delegate)
→ So only one delegate → mediator plays A1 for you
→ You: A1, opponent: A0 → you get 6 < 10 → worse

So you don’t want to delegate.

Similarly, opponent doesn’t.

But wait — is (A0, A0) stable?

Yes: if both play A0, you get 10.

If you deviate to A1: get 6 < 10 → not worth

If you delegate: as above, you get 6 or 4 → worse

So (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium? But only if no one wants to deviate.

But in this case, if both play A0, and no one delegates, yes.

But what if one player considers delegating?

Suppose you are playing A0 (not delegate), and Player 2 plays A0.

You consider delegating.

Then: you delegate, Player 2 does not → 1 delegate → you get A1

Then: A1 vs A0 → you get 6 < 10 → worse

So no incentive.

So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium with payoff 10.

But earlier we thought (A1, A1) was equilibrium, but now (A0, A0) is also?

Wait: in (A0, A0), with no delegation, both get 10.

But can Player 2 deviate?

If Player 2 deviates to A1: then you play A0, they play A1 → they get 20 — which is **more than 10**.

So **Player 2 has an incentive to deviate**.

Ah! Critical point.

In (A0, A0), Player 2 gets 10.

If they deviate to A1 (and you still play A0), they get 20 — much better.

So (A0, A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium.

Player 2 wants to deviate.

Similarly, Player 1 wants to deviate to A1 in (A0, A0)? No:

You: A0, opponents: A0 → you get 10

If you deviate to A1: A1 vs A0 → you get 6 < 10 → worse

So only **Player 2** wants to deviate.

So (A0, A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium.

In fact, **no one will play A0 if others play A0**, because the opponent can exploit you.

So only **A1** is safe.

But earlier we saw that if both play A1, you get 4.

Now, if both delegate, you get 10.

And in that case, if you deviate (to anything), you get 4 or less.

So only **both delegating** gives 10, and **no incentive to deviate**.

Similarly, if you **alone** delegate, you get only 4 (if opponent plays A1).

So **both delegating is a Nash equilibrium with payoff 10**.

Is there another?

Suppose you delegate with probability r, Player 2 with s.

But suppose Player 2 is rational.

Let’s suppose **Player 2 also wants to maximize their payoff**.

Now, suppose **you delegate**.

Then:
- If Player 2 does **not** delegate → 1 delegate → they get to play A0 or A1 on their own, but you get A1

If Player 2 plays A0 → they get 2 (against your A1)
If they play A1 → they get 4

So they prefer to play A1

So Player 2 will play A1

Then you get 4

But if you **don’t** delegate, and play A0, and Player 2 plays A1 → you get 0

Worse.

If you play A1, and they play A1 → you get 4

Same as before.

But if **you delegate**, you get **4**

If you **don’t delegate**, and play A1, you get **4**

Same.

But if **both delegate**, you get **10**

Now, suppose **you do not delegate**, and **Player 2 is considering**.

If you don’t delegate, and they delegate, then: 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 for them

So they get A1

Then your move: A0 or A1

They get better payoff when you play A0: you get 0 → they get 20

If you play A1: you get 4, they get 4

So if they delegate, they **want you to play A0**

But you don’t want to play A0.

So equilibrium may be tricky.

But back to the key: **Can you get 10 safely?**

Yes — if **both** delegate, you get 10.

Now, if **only one** delegates, you get only 4 (if opponent plays A1) or 6 (if opponent plays A0), but opponent wants to play A1.

So best for delegate is **both delegate**.

Now, can both delegate be an equilibrium?

Yes — as shown earlier.

- If both always delegate → you both get 10
- If you deviate to A0: opponent delegates → plays A1 → you play A0 vs A1 → you get 0 < 10 → bad
- If you deviate to A1: opponent delegates → plays A1 → you get 4 < 10 → bad
- If you delegate — same

So **no incentive to deviate**

Similarly for Player 2.

So **(both always delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium** with **10 points for you**

Also, is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?

For example, suppose you delegate with some probability.

But since **both delegating gives you 10**, and deviating gives you less, then **you should fully delegate**.

Similarly, Player 2 should too.

So in equilibrium, you should **always delegate**

Thus, your strategy should be: **A2 = 100**, A0 = 0, A1 = 0

But is this the **only** equilibrium?

Suppose Player 2 does not delegate.

Then you can’t get 10.

But if you think Player 2 is rational, they will **only delegate if they get at least as much as without**.

If Player 2 delegates and you don’t, then:
- You: not delegate → say you play A0 or A1
- Player 2: delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 for them

So Player 2 gets:
- If you play A0: 20
- If you play A1: 4

So to maximize, they want you to play A0.

But you don’t want to play A0 — you prefer A1.

So conflict.

But if both delegate, both get 10.

If Player 2 delegates while you don’t, they might get up to 20, but only if you play A0.

But you wouldn’t want to play A0.

So rational players: if they suspect the other will delegate, then for the delegate to get good payoff, the other must play A0.

But if the other doesn’t want to play A0, then delegating will give only 4 (if other plays A1).

So it's risky.

But if both delegate, you get guaranteed 10.

And no incentive to deviate.

So **both delegating** is a **safe, stable** equilibrium.

In contrast, unilateral delegation is risky because you might get only 4.

So a **rational** player should **only delegate if the other will too**.

But how to achieve that?

Since **both delegating gives 10**, and is **mutually beneficial**, and **stable**, it's a natural focal point.

Moreover, the mediator’s mechanism is designed so that **if two delegate, they both play A0 and get 10** — a high payoff.

This is better than any other outcome.

So **rational players should coordinate on both delegating**.

Thus, your best strategy is to **always delegate**.

Therefore, your strategy is:

- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

But wait — what if the other player does not delegate?

Then you get only 4.

But if you believe the other player is rational, and they know that **both delegating is an equilibrium**, they will also delegate.

So it’s a **common knowledge** rational solution.

In game theory, **this is a correlated equilibrium** or a **focal equilibrium**.

But since the question says **"maximize your total points"**, and you are allowed to choose a strategy, and assuming the other player is rational, you can **commit to delegating**, and expect them to follow.

If they don’t, you get only 4, but if they do, you get 10.

But if you **don’t** delegate, you get at most 4 or less.

So **any risk of getting 4 or less is worse than getting 10 if they cooperate**.

But since both have incentive to delegate (to get 10), and no incentive to deviate, **both will delegate**.

Thus, the equilibrium is clear.

**Final strategy: always delegate**

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P1
response:
Let’s break down this problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We have a two-player game with actions A0 and A1, and the payoff matrix is:

|          | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

We are Player 1, and we want to maximize our expected payoff.

But now there’s a **twist**: we can choose to **delegate** our move to a **mediator**, which is represented as a new action: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.

So now, actions are: **A0, A1, A2**

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator's Behavior**

The mediator acts based on how many players delegate to it:

- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So the mediator is **not** a neutral third party; its action depends on the **number of delegates**.

Important: Since we’re choosing whether to delegate, and the **other player** is also making the same decision (independently), we must reason about **joint outcomes**.

Let’s analyze the **possible joint delegation scenarios**.

---

### **Step 3: Determine All Possible Outcomes and Their Payoffs**

Each player chooses independently: A0, A1, or A2.

We need to consider all 9 combinations.

But note: The mediator’s action depends on how many players delegate. So:

---

#### **Case 1: You delegate (A2), Other player does NOT delegate (i.e., chooses A0 or A1)**

- Number of delegates = 1 → mediator plays **A1** for you.
- Your action becomes **A1**.
- Other player plays their chosen action (A0 or A1).

So your payoff depends on what the other player does.

##### Subcase 1.1: You delegate (A2), Other plays A0 → You get A1 vs A0 → payoff = **6**
##### Subcase 1.2: You delegate (A2), Other plays A1 → You get A1 vs A1 → payoff = **4**

---

#### **Case 2: You do NOT delegate (i.e., choose A0 or A1), Other player delegates (A2)**

- Number of delegates = 1 → mediator plays **A1** for the other player.
- So other player’s action becomes **A1**.
- You play your own action (A0 or A1).

So your payoff depends on what you do.

##### Subcase 2.1: You play A0, Other delegates → you play A0 vs A1 → payoff = **0**
##### Subcase 2.2: You play A1, Other delegates → you play A1 vs A1 → payoff = **4**

---

#### **Case 3: Both players delegate (A2)**

- Number of delegates = 2 → mediator plays **A0** for both players.
- So both players act as if they played A0.
- Payoff: A0 vs A0 → both get **10**

---

#### **Case 4: Neither player delegates**

Then both play their own actions (A0 or A1), as in the original game.

So the payoff is as per the original matrix.

---

So now, to model this, we need to consider the **mixed strategy** over A0, A1, A2.

Let:
- $ x $: probability you play A0
- $ y $: probability you play A1
- $ z $: probability you play A2

Then $ x + y + z = 1 $, and probabilities are all ≥ 0.

Similarly, the other player has their own strategy, say $ p $ for A0, $ q $ for A1, $ r $ for A2, with $ p + q + r = 1 $.

But since this is a **single decision** game (not repeated), and we are choosing a **mixed strategy** to **maximize expected payoff**, and we assume the other player is also rational, we should look for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies — but here, we are only choosing **our** strategy.

However, the question doesn’t say we know the other player’s strategy. But the goal is to **maximize our expected payoff**, so we must **assume the other player is also optimizing** and will play optimally.

Important: This is not a fully cooperative game. The other player is trying to maximize **their own** payoff.

So we need to model this as a **simultaneous move game with a new action** and look for **equilibrium** strategies.

But since we are only asked to choose a strategy (mixed) to **maximize our payoff**, and we don’t know the other player’s strategy, we must find a strategy that **perform well in equilibrium**.

Let’s instead try to **analyze what happens** in potential equilibria.

---

### **Step 4: Consider Equilibrium Thinking — What Might Both Players Do?**

Let’s think: can both players benefit from delegating?

Suppose **both players delegate** → then mediator plays A0 (since 2 delegates) → both get 10.

So this gives both players 10.

What if one delegates and the other doesn't?
- Delegator: gets A1 (because only 1 delegate), so gets:
  - If other plays A0: you play A1 vs A0 → 6
  - If other plays A1: you play A1 vs A1 → 4
- Non-delegator: faces player who plays A1 (since mediator plays A1), so:
  - If you play A0: 0
  - If you play A1: 4

So if you’re the non-delegator, playing A1 gives you 4, while playing A0 gives 0 → so you’ll play A1.

So if one delegates, other will play A1.

So the delegator gets A1 vs A1 → 4.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and the other delegates, you get 4 (by playing A1).

Wait — so both players get 4 in that case.

But if both delegate, both get 10.

So overall, **both delegating is better than one delegating**.

But is **both delegating** stable?

Suppose both players are currently delegating → both get 10.

Now, can one player **deviate** and get more?

Suppose you are playing A2 (delegate), other player is playing A2.

If *you* deviate and play A0 instead (don’t delegate), then:
- Now only one delegate (the other player) → mediator plays A1 for the other player.
- You play A0, other plays A1 → you get **0**

0 < 10 → bad.

If you deviate and play A1 instead:
- Still only one delegate (other player) → mediator plays A1 for other player.
- You play A1, other plays A1 → you get **4**

4 < 10 → still worse.

So **no incentive to deviate** from delegating when the other is delegating.

So **both delegating** is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Now, is there another equilibrium?

Suppose **neither delegates**.

Then you’re in the original game.

Let’s check the pure strategy Nash equilibria of the original game:

- (A0, A0): (10,10) — is it NE? If you deviate to A1, you get 6 < 10 → no. So yes, it’s a NE.
- (A1, A1): (4,4) — if you deviate to A0, you get 0 < 4 → so no incentive → NE.
- (A0, A1): (0,20) — if you (Player 1) deviate to A1, you get 4 > 0 → so not NE.
- (A1, A0): (6,2) — if Player 2 deviates to A1, gets 4 > 2 → not NE.

So pure NEs are (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

Now, if both players are playing A0 (non-delegating), you get 10.

But if you **unilaterally deviate** to A2 (delegate), then:
- Only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 for you.
- Other player plays A0 → you play A1 vs A0 → get 6 < 10 → worse.

So no incentive to deviate.

Similarly, if both play A1 (non-delegating), you get 4.

If you deviate to delegate (A2), you get A1 vs A1 → 4 → same as before → no gain.

But no loss either.

But if you play A2 when other plays A1, you get 4.

But in (A1,A1), you get 4 anyway.

So no incentive to change.

But can you get more?

Now — suppose **both play A2** (delegate) → you get 10.

So in this case, you get 10, versus only 4 in (A1,A1).

So **both delegating** gives a higher payoff.

Now, what if you play (A2, A2)? You get 10.

But can one player **unilaterally** deviate and do better?

We saw: if you deviate to A0 or A1, you get 0 or 4 < 10 → no.

So (A2, A2) is a **strict Nash equilibrium**.

Now, what about **mixed strategies**?

Let’s consider: could players mix between delegating and not?

But first, note that **(A2, A2)** gives both players 10 — **better than any pure strategy equilibrium in the base game**.

Is there a reason for a player to not want to delegate?

Only if they fear the other player won’t delegate — but in equilibrium, we assume both play the same strategy.

Now, suppose **only one player delegates** — then the other gets 4, and the delegator also gets 4 (since mediator plays A1, and the other player will play A1 to avoid 0).

So in that case, both get 4.

But if both delegate, both get 10.

So both players prefer **both to delegate**.

But if both players are rational and understand this, they should **both choose A2**.

Moreover, **there is no incentive to deviate**.

Hence, the unique **Pareto-efficient, stable, and mutually beneficial equilibrium** is **both delegate**.

Now, what if one player tries to threaten not to delegate? But since the other can also delegate, and the outcome is better for both, it’s stable.

So **the equilibrium strategy** is for **both players to play A2 with probability 1**.

But wait — is that **the only** equilibrium?

Suppose one player is playing A2 with probability 1.

Then the other player, if they play A2, get 10.

If they play A0: then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → other player plays A1 → you play A0 vs A1 → 0 < 10 → worse.

If they play A1: play A1 vs A1 → 4 < 10 → worse.

So **best response is to play A2**.

Hence, (A2, A2) is a **strict Nash equilibrium**.

Now, are there other equilibria?

Suppose both players play A0 with high probability — but then a player can deviate to A2 and get 6 or 4, but if others are playing A0, and you deviate to A2, you get A1 vs A0 → 6.

But if you’re in (A0, A0), you get 10 — which is better than 6.

So no incentive to deviate.

But the problem is, if both are playing A0, you get 10.

But if one deviates to A2, they get 6.

Still less, so no.

But if **both play A2**, you get 10.

So (A2, A2) is better.

But is the equilibrium at (A0, A0) stable?

Yes, but it gives you only 10, same as (A2, A2).

But wait: (A0, A0) payoff is 10, (A2, A2) payoff is also 10.

But is there a better one?

No.

But here’s a key point: in (A2, A2), you get 10.

In (A0, A0), you get 10.

But in (A2, A2), you are **immune to unilateral deviation**: if you unilaterally deviate, you get less.

Similarly, in (A0, A0), if you deviate to A1, you get 6 < 10 → so stable.

But what if a player believes the other will play A0?

Then you can choose to play A2 → then you play A1 vs A0 → get 6.

But if you play A0, you get 10.

So better to play A0.

So if you expect the other to play A0, you should **not** delegate — you should play A0.

But if you expect the other to delegate, you should play A1 (to get 4 rather than 0) or A2 (to get 10).

But now, suppose **you don’t know what the other player will do**.

But since this is a **one-shot decision**, and both players are rational, we must define a **Bayesian-like equilibrium**, but since it’s symmetric and both are rational, the **coordinated equilibrium** (A2, A2) is the most **robust and beneficial**.

Moreover, **both players** prefer (A2, A2) to (A0, A0), because (A2, A2) leads to a higher coordination and **no risk of getting 0**.

Wait — is (A0, A0) really safe?

Yes — but in (A2, A2), you get 10 — same.

But if one deviates, others get less — but in (A0, A0), if one deviates to A1, the other gets 2 — worse for them.

But in (A2, A2), deviation gives 4 or 0 → still worse for deviator.

So both are stable.

But now, here’s a twist: **if both play A2, you get 10.**

But if you play A0 and expect the other to play A0, you get 10.

But if the other plays A2 (delegate), and you play A0, you get 0 — which is worse.

So **playing A0 is risky** if the other might delegate.

Similarly, playing A1 is also risky unless you know what the other does.

Whereas playing A2 gives you **10** if the other also plays A2, but if the other plays A0 or A1, you get 6 or 4.

But if you **play A2**, and the other **does not** delegate, you get:
- If other plays A0 → you get 6
- If other plays A1 → you get 4

Both > 0, which is better than what you’d get in (A0, A1) if you played A0.

But more importantly: **if you randomize, your best strategy must consider the other player’s actions.**

But since the game is symmetric and both are rational, the most **credible and stable** equilibrium is for both to **play A2 with probability 1**.

Moreover, in that case, **you get 10 with certainty**.

Now, suppose you play A0 with some probability. Then, if the other player plays A2, you get 0 (if you play A0) or 4 (if you play A1) — but if the other plays A2, and you play A0 → you get 0.

So playing A0 is **risky**.

Similarly, playing A1, if other plays A2 → you play A1 vs A1 → 4.

But if other plays A0, and you play A1 → 6.

But if other plays A1 → 4.

So you might wonder: could a mixed strategy be better?

But we don’t know the other's strategy.

However, since (A2, A2) is a NE and gives you 10, and **no unilateral deviation can improve your payoff**, it’s a **dominant strategy in equilibrium**.

Moreover, **delegation is a way to coordinate on A0** only when **both** delegate, because mediator plays A0.

And since both players benefit from that outcome (10 each), and there’s no incentive to deviate, **both should delegate**.

Therefore, the **optimal strategy** for you is to **always delegate**, i.e., play A2 with 100% probability.

### **Step 5: Final Answer**

We must output a JSON with probabilities for A0, A1, A2 summing to 100.

From the above reasoning:

- Playing A2 (delegate) leads to a stable equilibrium (A2, A2), giving you 10 points.
- Deviating to A0 or A1 gives you less (0 or 4 or 6) if the other is delegating.
- If you're uncertain, but the other player is rational, they will also delegate.
- So **playing A2 with 100% probability** maximizes your guaranteed outcome in equilibrium.

Also, playing A0 or A1 introduces **risk** of getting 0 (if the other delegates and you play A0).

Therefore, **delegating is strictly best**.

### ✅ Final Output:

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.


Instruction:

- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without Delegation**

We have a two-player game with actions:

- A0 (Player 1 chooses A0)
- A1 (Player 1 chooses A1)

The payoff matrix (from Player 1's perspective) is:

|                | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 10           | 0            |
| **Player 1: A1** | 6            | 4            |

This is a classic 2x2 game. Let’s find the Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies without delegation first.

But note — now we have a **new action**: A2, which is “Delegate to Mediator”. And if you delegate, your move is determined by how many players delegate:

- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A0.
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0.

So regardless of whether 1 or 2 players delegate, the mediator **always plays A0**.

Thus, if **you delegate**, your action becomes **A0**, no matter what.

Important: The mediator is used only for the player who chooses A2. So:
- If you choose A2, you are delegating, and your action will be A0.
- If the other player also chooses A2 (delegates), then both are delegating → still, the mediator plays A0.

So, if **either one or both** delegate, you play A0.

Only when you don’t delegate (i.e., choose A0 or A1) do you act independently.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Impact of Delegation**

Since the mediator always plays A0, **choosing A2 (delegate)** means you're effectively playing A0, but you’re not using your own choice — your action is fixed at A0.

Now, consider the implications:

- If you choose A2, you get the payoffs associated with playing A0.

But here’s the twist: **You may choose to delegate or not**, and **the other player’s decision affects the outcome**.

However, you must decide on a **probability distribution** over {A0, A1, A2} such that you maximize your expected points.

So we need to think strategically: Should I delegate? Or play A0/A1?

Let’s analyze the consequences of each possible combination.

---

### **Step 3: Payoff Analysis Based on Action Choices**

Let P be the probability that *you* choose A0, A1, A2 (with A2 being delegate).

Let Q be the probability that the *other player* chooses A0, A1, A2.

But since we’re choosing a mixed strategy, and the other player might also use randomization, we want to find a symmetric equilibrium or at least a rational strategy assuming the other player uses some strategy — but we are told to **maximize our total points**, so we assume rational play from both sides, but since we are solving for our best response, we can assume the other player behaves optimally too.

But let's take it step by step.

Let’s denote:
- Your strategy: (p0, p1, p2), where p0 = P(A0), p1 = P(A1), p2 = P(A2), and p0 + p1 + p2 = 100.

Similarly for opponent: (q0, q1, q2), q0 + q1 + q2 = 100.

But since this is a simultaneous-move game and we are choosing our own strategy to maximize our expected payoff, we should try to find a **best response** to the other player’s strategy — but since the other player is also rational and we want to maximize our own score, we assume a symmetric Nash equilibrium? Not necessarily.

However, there’s a better way: analyze **dominance and incentives** to see if delegation is ever beneficial.

---

### **Step 4: Compare Outcomes When You Delegate (A2)**

If you delegate (choose A2), you **will play A0** (because the mediator always plays A0).

So, regardless of what the other player does, your effective action is A0.

Therefore, your payoff depends only on what the other player does — but the other player’s choice can be A0, A1, or A2.

Let’s compute your expected payoff **if you delegate** (i.e., you choose A2):

#### Case 1: Other player plays A0
- You are A0, they are A0 → you get **10**
- This happens with prob q0

#### Case 2: Other player plays A1
- You are A0, they are A1 → you get **0**
- This happens with prob q1

#### Case 3: Other player plays A2 (delegates)
- You are A0, they are A0 (since mediator plays A0) → you get **10**
- This happens with prob q2

So, your expected payoff IF YOU DELEGATE is:

> E[Delegate] = 10*q0 + 0*q1 + 10*q2 = 10*(q0 + q2)

Note that q0 + q1 + q2 = 1 ⇒ q0 + q2 = 1 - q1

So:
> E[Delegate] = 10*(1 - q1)

So your expected payoff from delegating is **10 times (1 minus their probability of choosing A1)**.

Now, what if you **do not delegate**? Then you can choose A0 or A1, and you can mix between them.

Suppose you choose A0: your expected payoff is:
- If opponent A0: 10 → prob q0
- If opponent A1: 0 → prob q1
- If opponent A2: → opponent plays A0, so you are A0 vs A0 → 10 → prob q2
→ So: 10*q0 + 0*q1 + 10*q2 = 10*(q0 + q2) = same as above!

Wait! That’s interesting.

So:
- Choosing A0 gives E[A0] = 10*(q0 + q2)
- Choosing A2 (delegate) gives E[Delegate] = 10*(q0 + q2)

So **they yield the same expected payoff!**

But what about choosing A1?

If you choose A1:
- Opponent A0 → you get 6 → prob q0
- Opponent A1 → you get 4 → prob q1
- Opponent A2 → opponent plays A0 → you get 6 → prob q2

So:
> E[A1] = 6*q0 + 4*q1 + 6*q2 = 6*(q0 + q2) + 4*q1

Now compare all three:

- E[A0] = 10*(q0 + q2)
- E[A2] = 10*(q0 + q2)
- E[A1] = 6*(q0 + q2) + 4*q1

Now, since q0 + q2 = 1 - q1,
- E[A0] = E[A2] = 10*(1 - q1)
- E[A1] = 6*(1 - q1) + 4*q1 = 6 - 6q1 + 4q1 = 6 - 2q1

Compare E[A0] = 10 - 10q1 vs E[A1] = 6 - 2q1

When is E[A0] > E[A1]?
10 - 10q1 > 6 - 2q1  
⇒ 4 > 8q1  
⇒ q1 < 0.5

So:
- If opponent plays A1 with probability < 0.5, then A0 (or delegate) is better than A1.
- If q1 > 0.5, then A1 is better.
- If q1 = 0.5, they give equal.

But notice: **A0 and A2 yield identical expected payoffs** in any case.

Therefore, **there is no advantage in preferring A0 over A2 (or vice versa)** — unless cost exists? But there’s no cost mentioned.

So from **expected value perspective**, playing A0 and playing A2 (delegate) are **indistinguishable** — they lead to the same payoff depending on the opponent’s strategy.

So why would you choose one over the other?

Wait — but there's a twist: **The mediator only acts if you delegate**, but if you don’t delegate, you choose your own action.

But since both A0 and A2 give the same expected payoff against any opponent strategy, then **your best response depends on the other player’s behavior**.

But now suppose we consider **symmetric equilibria**.

Assume both players are rational and symmetric.

Let’s suppose both players use the same mixed strategy: (p0, p1, p2), symmetric.

Then, for us, the other player has:
- q0 = p0
- q1 = p1
- q2 = p2

Our goal: maximize our own expected payoff.

Let’s suppose we fix our own strategy: (p0, p1, p2). We want to pick probabilities to **maximize** expected payoff **assuming the other uses same strategy**.

But maybe we don’t need full symmetry — perhaps one strategy dominates.

But let’s consider: Could there be an incentive to **deviate**?

But more importantly: **Is there a dominant strategy?**

Let’s look at **unconditional** performance.

Suppose the other player plays pure strategies.

#### Case 1: Other player always plays A0

Then:
- If you play A0: you get 10
- If you play A1: you get 6
- If you play A2: you get 10 (since you play A0, opponent A0)

So best is A0 or A2 → both give 10

#### Case 2: Other player always plays A1

Then:
- You play A0: 0
- You play A1: 4
- You play A2: 10 (since you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 0?! Wait!)

Wait — this is crucial:

Earlier we said **when you delegate, you play A0**, and then outcome depends on opponent's action.

But if you delegate → you play A0.

If opponent plays A1 → then outcome is: you A0, opponent A1 → **you get 0 points**

But earlier I said when others play A2, you get 10 because opponent plays A0. But if opponent plays A1, then you get 0.

I made a critical mistake.

Let me correct that.

---

### **Critical Correction: Payoffs depend on actual actions of opponents**

Let’s re-analyze based on what the **opponent actually does**, not just what they choose.

Each player chooses an action: A0, A1, or A2.

But:
- If player chooses A2 → they are delegating → mediator plays A0 → so their **effective action is A0**
- If player chooses A0 or A1 → they play that action

So the final outcome is determined by:
- Your effective action: A0 if you chose A0 or A2; A1 if you chose A1
- Opponent’s effective action: same logic

So we can define:

Your effective action:
- A0 if you choose A0 or A2
- A1 if you choose A1

Opponent’s effective action:
- A0 if they choose A0 or A2
- A1 if they choose A1

Therefore, the four outcomes are based on the **effective actions**.

So, if you choose A2 → you are acting as A0.

Thus, if you delegate (A2):
- If opponent plays A0 (whether they chose A0 or A2): you get 10 (A0 vs A0)
- If opponent plays A1 (they chose A1): you get 0 (A0 vs A1)

Same as if you had chosen A0 yourself.

But **this means: Choosing A0 or choosing A2 gives you identical outcomes and payoffs** in every scenario.

Because both result in playing A0.

So:
- A0 and A2 are **strategically equivalent**.

Therefore, there is **no difference in payoff** between choosing A0 and choosing A2, given the opponent’s choice.

Therefore, **from a payoff perspective, A0 and A2 are interchangeable**.

So we can combine them.

Now, what about A1? It gives different payoffs.

So your strategy space is: you can play A0 (effectively A0), A1 (effectively A1), or A2 (effectively A0).

So effectively, you’re choosing:
- With some probability: play A0
- With some probability: play A1

And the A2 choice is just a way to play A0.

Now, the key insight: Since A0 and A2 give the same payoff, and there is no cost to delegation, but potentially other reasons (e.g., if you believe others are strategic), but since there’s no extra cost or benefit, and both give identical payoffs, **they are indistinguishable**.

So our optimal mixed strategy can include A2 only if it doesn't hurt, but since it mimics A0, and A0 is valuable, we can assign probability to A2 instead of A0 — but since they are identical, it doesn’t matter which we use.

But wait — could there be a reason to **prefer A2**?

Only if it influences the other player’s behavior.

But the other player doesn’t know what you’re doing — they only choose their action.

Also, in the payoff table, nothing changes based on whether you delegated or played A0 — only the effective action matters.

So from a strategic point of view: **Choosing A2 is functionally identical to choosing A0** in terms of payoffs.

Therefore, we can **treat A2 as a "free" way to play A0**, with no cost.

So unless there's a reason to distinguish, we can use either.

But the question asks to **maximize our total points**, and we are allowed to set any probabilities.

Now, suppose we ask: What is the optimal strategy for Player 1?

We go back to the original 2x2 game without delegation.

In the original game (without A2), the payoffs are:
|               | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0**     | 10    | 0     |
| **P1 A1**     | 6     | 4     |

Let’s find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Suppose Player 2 mixes: Play A0 with probability q, A1 with probability 1−q.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If play A0: 10*q + 0*(1−q) = 10q
- If play A1: 6*q + 4*(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Player 1 is indifferent when:
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.5, A1 with 0.5.

Then Player 1’s payoff: 10*0.5 = 5 (or 2*0.5 + 4 = 5)

Similarly, by symmetry, Player 1 should also play A0 with 0.5, A1 with 0.5.

Wait — but let’s check: if Player 1 plays A0 with 0.5, A1 with 0.5, then Player 2’s best response?

Player 2’s payoff:
- If they play A0: 10*p0 + 2*p1 = 10*(0.5) + 2*(0.5) = 5 + 1 = 6
- If they play A1: 20*p0 + 4*p1 = 20*(0.5) + 4*(0.5) = 10 + 2 = 12

So Player 2 wants to play A1 to get 12 > 6 → so (0.5, 0.5) is **not** equilibrium.

Ah! So no symmetric mixed equilibrium in just A0/A1.

Let’s find the actual mixed equilibrium.

Let Player 1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1−p.

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If play A0: 10*p + 2*(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- If play A1: 20*p + 4*(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal for indifference:
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → impossible.

That can’t be.

Wait — this suggests Player 2 **always prefers A1**, regardless of p?

Check:

- Is 16p + 4 ≥ 8p + 2 for all p?
→ 16p + 4 − (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 ≥ 0 for p ≥ -0.25 → always true.

So Player 2 always gets higher payoff by playing A1 than A0, for any p.

So Player 2 will **always play A1** in equilibrium.

Then, Player 1’s best response: if Player 2 always plays A1,

- A0: 0 points
- A1: 4 points

So Player 1 should play A1 → get 4

But wait — if Player 1 plays A1, then Player 2 knows that, and since Player 2 gets 4 when they play A1 (vs Player 1 A1) → but is that their best?

If Player 1 plays A1, then:
- Player 2 plays A0: gets 2 (P2 A0, P1 A1 → P2 gets 2)
- Player 2 plays A1: gets 4 → better

So yes, Player 2 plays A1.

Player 1 plays A1 → gets 4.

Is there a reason to deviate?

If Player 1 plays A0, gets 0 < 4 → worse.

So this is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**: Both play A1 → each gets 4.

But is it stable?

Suppose both play A1 → each gets 4.

Can Player 1 gain by switching to A0? Gets 0 → worse.

Player 2: switch to A0? Gets 2 → worse.

So yes, (A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

But are there others?

What if Player 1 plays A0?

Then Player 2 prefers A1 (gets 20) rather than A0 (gets 10) → so Player 2 plays A1.

Then Player 1: A0 vs A1 → gets 0; A1 vs A1 → gets 4 → so Player 1 prefers A1.

So only equilibrium is both playing A1.

But wait — what if Player 2 plays A0?

Then Player 1: A0 → 10, A1 → 6 → prefers A0.

But then Player 2: if Player 1 plays A0, then P2 gets 10 if A0, 20 if A1 → so P2 prefers A1 → contradiction.

So if P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → then P1 would prefer to play A1 → so no equilibrium in that region.

Only stable outcome is both playing A1.

But is there a mixed strategy?

Suppose Player 2 plays A1 with probability q.

Then Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10*q + 0*(1−q) = 10q
- A1: 6*q + 4*(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Now, set equal: 10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So if Player 2 plays A1 with 0.5, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

So Player 1 can mix.

Now, what should Player 2 do?

If Player 1 mixes with p (P(p0)), then Player 2’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10*p + 2*(1−p) = 8p + 2
- A1: 20*p + 4*(1−p) = 16p + 4

For Player 2 to be willing to mix, must have:
16p + 4 = 8p + 2 → 8p = -2 → p = -0.25 → impossible.

So Player 2 never finds it optimal to mix — they always prefer A1.

Therefore, the only equilibrium is **both play A1**.

So in the absence of delegation, the unique Nash equilibrium is both players playing A1 → each gets 4 points.

But now, with delegation available — and **delegation forces you to play A0**, which is **worse** than A1, because:

- If opponent plays A1, you get 4 by playing A1, but **0** by playing A0 (via delegation)

So delegation is **bad** if opponent plays A1?

Wait — but only if opponent plays A1.

But in equilibrium, opponent plays A1.

So if you delegate, you play A0 → if opponent plays A1, you get 0.

But if you play A1, you get 4.

So clearly, **delegating is worse than playing A1**, if the other player is playing A1.

But what if you don’t know?

But in equilibrium, both play A1.

So delegation gives you 0, while playing A1 gives you 4.

So why delegate?

Unless you can coordinate.

But the twist is: **The mediator always plays A0**, whether one or two players delegate.

So even if both delegate, you both play A0 → so both get 10 if opponent also plays A0.

But if both are supposed to play A1 in equilibrium, but you both delegate, you both play A0 → then payoff is (A0,A0) → 10 each.

That’s better!

So there’s a **possible coordination benefit**.

Suppose both players **agree to delegate**.

Then both play A0 → both get 10.

Much better than 4.

But is this credible?

If you delegate and the other delegates → you both get 10.

But if you delegate and they play A1 → you get 0.

So you only want to delegate if you believe the other will also delegate (so both play A0).

But they can think the same.

So is there an equilibrium where both delegate?

Let’s suppose both players choose A2 (delegate) with probability 1.

Then:
- Each plays A0 (effective)
- Outcome: A0 vs A0 → each gets 10

Now, check if any player wants to deviate.

Suppose you deviate to A1.

Then: you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 6.

6 < 10 → worse → so you won’t deviate.

If you deviate to A0? Doesn’t matter — same payoff.

So deviation to A1 gives only 6 < 10 → so not profitable.

So **(A2, A2)** is a Nash equilibrium: both delegate → get 10.

Similarly, (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium: both play A0 → get 10 → if you deviate to A1, get 6 < 10 → so stable.

So multiple equilibria exist.

But now, which one to choose?

We want to **maximize our expected points**.

But we don’t know what the other player will do.

But we need a strategy that maximizes our expected payoff, possibly assuming the other uses some strategy.

But here’s the key: we can choose a mixed strategy that includes A2.

Let’s suppose we play A2 with some probability, and others.

But earlier we saw that **A0 and A2 are equivalent** in payoffs.

So we can think of a strategy where we play 'A0' with some probability, which includes both A0 and A2.

But here’s the twist: **we can use delegation as a way to commit to A0**, which might help in coordination.

But since both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) give 10, and both are equilibria, but in the absence of communication, we might end up in (A1,A1) with payoff 4.

So perhaps the best strategy is to make it **profitable to delegate**.

But we already have that (A2,A2) is an equilibrium with payoff 10.

So if we think the other player will also delegate, we should delegate.

But to maximize our expected payoff, we need to choose a strategy that performs well regardless.

Alternatively, we can look for a strategy that makes A2 attractive.

But remember: **A0 and A2 are strategy-wise identical** — they produce same action and payoff.

So assigning probability to A0 or A2 doesn't change outcome.

Therefore, in terms of payoffs, we can **combine A0 and A2** into one "play A0" option.

Let’s therefore define:

Let x = P(play A0) = P(choose A0) + P(choose A2)

Let y = P(play A1) = P(choose A1)

Then x + y = 1

Now, the other player has similar: say x', y'

Then your expected payoff is:

= x*x'*10 + x*y'*0 + y*x'*6 + y*y'*4

= 10 x x' + 0 + 6 y x' + 4 y y'

But x = 1 - y, x' = 1 - y'

Also y = 1 - x, etc.

So E = 10 x x' + 6(1 - x) x' + 4(1 - x)(1 - x')

= 10 x x' + 6 x' - 6 x x' + 4(1 - x - x' + x x')
= (10xx' - 6xx') + 6x' + 4 - 4x - 4x' + 4xx'
= 4 xx' + 2x' + 4 - 4x

= 4xx' + 2x' - 4x + 4

Now, this is complicated.

But recall that without delegation, the only equilibrium was (A1,A1) giving 4.

With delegation, we can enter (A2,A2) giving 10.

But to achieve 10, we need to **trust** the other player to also delegate.

But if we don't trust them, we might get 0.

So perhaps we should consider a mixed strategy that **rewards cooperation**.

But since there’s no communication, we need a strategy that is **self-enforcing**.

But here’s a new idea: **Since A2 is equivalent to A0 in payoff, but allows coordination**, and since (A2,A2) is a Nash equilibrium giving 10, which is better than 4, we should aim for that.

Moreover, if both players use A2, we get 10.

If we are unsure, but we believe the other player will also play A2, then we should.

But what if we mix?

Suppose we play A2 with probability z, A0 with p, A1 with (1-p-z)

But since A0 and A2 are indistinguishable, the only thing that matters is whether you are playing A0 or A1.

So the optimal strategy is simply to play A0 with some probability, A1 with some.

But because (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) are both equilibria with 10, and (A1,A1) with 4, the safe strategy is to play A0 as much as possible.

But if the other player plays A1, you get 0 if you play A0.

Whereas if you play A1, you get 4.

So if the other player might play A1, you should not play A0/ A2.

But if they play A0, you get 10 if you play A0.

So you need to believe they play A0.

But there’s no information.

However, observe: **If both players expect the other to delegate, then they are better off delegating**.

But this is circular.

But here’s the key: **The mediator is selected via approval voting, and is proposed by Player 2**.

This might suggest that Player 2 expects it to be used.

And since both players can delegate, and if both do, they get 10, which is better than 4.

Moreover, **the mediator cannot hurt you** — it just plays A0.

And playing A0 can be good if the other player cooperates.

But to maximize expected points, we need to choose a strategy where the **worst-case** is not too bad, and **best-case** is high.

But we can use a **grim trigger or tit-for-tat**, but we can’t communicate.

Given that (A2,A2) is an equilibrium with 10, and since you have control, and the other player might be rational, **why not play A2**?

Because if they play A1, you get 0.

But if you play A1, you get 4.

4 > 0.

So why risk getting 0?

Unless you believe they will also delegate.

But without commitment, you can’t coordinate.

But here’s the insight: **Delegation has no downside compared to playing A0, and no upside** — it’s identical.

So the only reason to use A2 is if there’s a chance of cooperation.

But to maximize expected utility, you should calculate.

Suppose you believe the other player will delegate with probability r.

Then, if you delegate:
- Expected payoff = 10 * r + 0 * (1-r) = 10r

If you play A0:
- Same: 10r

If you play A1:
- 6*r + 4*(1-r) = 6r + 4 - 4r = 2r + 4

Now, compare 10r vs 2r + 4:
10r > 2r + 4 → 8r > 4 → r > 0.5

So if you believe the other player will delegate with r > 0.5, then delegation is better than A1.

If r > 0.5, then 10r > 2r + 4 → yes.

But 10r > 2r + 4 → r > 0.5.

So if you believe the other player will delegate with probability > 50%, then playing A2 (or A0) is better than A1.

But if r < 0.5, then A1 is better.

But what is r?

Since the mediator was proposed by Player 2, and approved by players, it is likely that players are willing to delegate.

Even if not, but since (A2,A2) is an equilibrium, and it gives 10, which is better than 4, it's plausible that both will choose A2.

Moreover, if you choose A2, and the other player chooses A1, you get 0, but if you choose A1, you get 4.

But if you choose A2 and they choose A2, you get 10.

So it’s risky.

But let’s suppose the other player uses A2 with probability s.

Then your expected payoff from:
- A0: 10*s
- A2: 10*s
- A1: 6*s + 4*(1-s) = 6s + 4 - 4s = 2s + 4

Now, to maximize, you should choose the action with highest EV.

But we can choose a mixed strategy.

Let p0 = P(A0), p1 = P(A1), p2 = P(A2), sum to 100.

Your expected payoff:

= sum_{action i, j} P(i) P(j) payoffs

But since A0 and A2 behave the same, we can group them.

Let p_A0 = p0 + p2 = probability you play A0 effective

p_A1 = p1

Then your expected payoff against a player with probability q_A0 and q_A1 is:

E = p_A0 * q_A0 * 10 + p_A0 * q_A1 * 0 + p_A1 * q_A0 * 6 + p_A1 * q_A1 * 4

= 10 p_A0 q_A0 + 6 p_A1 q_A0 + 4 p_A1 q_A1

= 10 p_A0 q_A0 + 6 (1 - p_A0) q_A0 + 4 (1 - p_A0) (1 - q_A0)

= 10 p_A0 q_A0 + 6 q_A0 - 6 p_A0 q_A0 + 4(1 - q_A0 - p_A0 + p_A0 q_A0)
= (10-6)p_A0 q_A0 + 6 q_A0 + 4 - 4 q_A0 - 4 p_A0 + 4 p_A0 q_A0
= 4 p_A0 q_A0 + 2 q_A0 + 4 - 4 p_A0

To maximize this expression in terms of p_A0, given q_A0.

But since we don't know q_A0, but we want to design p_A0 to maximize our expected value, perhaps assume q_A0 = p_A0, symmetric.

Assume both players use the same strategy.

Then q_A0 = p_A0

So E = 4 p_A0^2 + 2 p_A0 + 4 - 4 p_A0
= 4 p_A0^2 - 2 p_A0 + 4

This is a quadratic in p_A0.

Maximize E = 4p^2 - 2p + 4

Derivative: 8p - 2 = 0 → p = 2/8 = 0.25

Then E = 4*(0.0625) - 2*(0.25) + 4 = 0.25 - 0.5 + 4 = 3.75

Which is less than 4, so not good.

At p_A0 = 1: E = 4 - 2 + 4 = 6

At p_A0 = 1: 4(1)^2 - 2(1) + 4 = 4 -2 +4 = 6

At p_A0 = 1, E = 6

But in symmetric equilibrium, if p_A0 = 1, then q_A0 = 1, so both play A0, get 10.

But according to formula: E = 4(1)^2 -2(1) +4 = 6, but should be 10.

Mistake in formula.

I see — the formula is wrong because I plugged in q_A0 = p_A0, but in the expression, it should be evaluated with specific q.

Better to directly plug into payoff.

If both players play A0 (effective), payoff is 10.

If both play A1, payoff is 4.

So if we play A0 with probability 1 (p_A0 = 1), and other player does the same, we get 10.

If we play A0 with p_A0 = 1, and they play A1 with 1, we get 0.

But if both use p_A0 = 1, we get 10.

The only way to get 10 is if both play A0.

Otherwise, less.

To guarantee high payoff, we should play A0 with high probability.

But if the other player plays A1, we get 0.

But if we play A1, we get 4 even if they play A1.

The safest is to play A1.

But the highest possible is 10.

But since in equilibrium both play A1, we get 4.

Unless we can coordinate.

But the only way to achieve 10 is to both delegate.

And since the mediator is proposed and approved, and delegation is available, and it leads to A0, which is better if both cooperate, perhaps the best is to delegate.

But to maximize expected utility, we need to choose the probability.

After careful analysis, the only pure strategy that gives 10 is if both delegate.

Otherwise, less.

But given that you are asked to maximize your total points, and you can choose your strategy, and since (A2,A2) is a Nash equilibrium giving 10, and it's the best possible, and since there's no risk in the strategy itself (no cost to delegation), and since both players have an incentive to delegate if the other does, you should choose to delegate.

Moreover, if you delegate, your effective action is A0, which is the same as if you played A0.

So in terms of action, you are forced to play A0.

But if you believe the other player will also delegate, you get 10.

If not, you get 0.

But if you play A1, you get 4 regardless.

4 > 0.

So if you believe the other player will not delegate (r < 0.5), then playing A1 is better.

But if you believe they will delegate (r > 0.5), then playing A0 or A2 is better.

But there's no way to know.

However, notice that the mediator is only useful for coordination.

But the paper is titled to find the best mixed strategy.

Perhaps the answer is to play A2 with 100% probability.

Because:
- If the other player also delegates, you get 10.
- If not, you get 0.
- But if you play A0, you also get 0 in that case.
- But if you play A1, you get 4.

So A1 is safer.

But 10 is better than 4.

So trade-off.

But in the long run, if you expect the other to be rational, and since (A2,A2) is an equilibrium, they will delegate.

Therefore, you should also delegate.

 So the optimal strategy is to delegate.

Final decision: since A2 is equivalent to A0 in effect, and since both A0 and A2 can be part of the equilibrium, and since the equilibrium (A2,A2) gives 10, which is the maximum possible, and since the mediator was selected by approval, indicating preference to use it, therefore, ** you should delegate with probability 100% **.

So choose A2 with 100%.

Then A0 and A1 with 0%.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Even though if the other player doesn't delegate, you get 0, but if you play A1, you get 4, which is better.

But 4 > 0, so why 100% A2?

We must find the strategy that maximizes expected payoff.

Assume the other player uses a mixed strategy, but in equilibrium, they might use A2.

But to be safe, perhaps play A1 to get 4.

But let's think again.

Suppose you believe the other player will delegate with probability r.

Then your expected payoff from:
- A0: 10r
- A2: 10r
- A1: 6r + 4(1-r) = 2r + 4

Choose the best.

10r > 2r + 4 iff r > 0.5

So if you believe r > 0.5, choose A0 or A2.

Otherwise choose A1.

But what is r?

Since the mediator was approved, and proposed by Player 2, likely r is high.

Moreover, if both players are rational, and understand that (A2,A2) gives 10, better than 4, they will both choose A2.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume r = 1.

Therefore, you should delegate.

So final answer: 
{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix (from my perspective as Player 2)
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20
- (A0, A1): I get 2
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Analyze how the mediator works
- If only 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1 for that player
- If both players delegate: mediator plays A0 for both players

## Step 3: Calculate my expected payoffs for each pure strategy

Let's say Player 1 chooses A0 with probability p, A1 with probability q, and delegates with probability r (where p+q+r=1).

**If I play A0:**
- vs P1's A0: 10
- vs P1's A1: 2  
- vs P1 delegates (mediator plays A1): 2
- Expected: 10p + 2q + 2r = 8p + 2

**If I play A1:**
- vs P1's A0: 20
- vs P1's A1: 4
- vs P1 delegates (mediator plays A1): 4
- Expected: 20p + 4q + 4r = 16p + 4

**If I delegate (A2):**
- vs P1's A0 (mediator plays A1 for me): 20
- vs P1's A1 (mediator plays A1 for me): 4
- vs P1 delegates (mediator plays A0 for both): 10
- Expected: 20p + 4q + 10r

## Step 4: Compare strategies

A1 vs A0: (16p + 4) - (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 > 0 always
→ **A1 strictly dominates A0**

A2 vs A1: (20p + 4q + 10r) - (16p + 4) = 6r ≥ 0
→ **A2 weakly dominates A1** (strictly better when r > 0)

## Step 5: Check if both delegating is a Nash equilibrium

If both delegate: We both get 10
- If I deviate to A1: I get 4 (worse)
- If I deviate to A0: I get 2 (worse)
- If P1 deviates to A1: P1 gets 4 (worse)
- If P1 deviates to A0: P1 gets 0 (worse)

Yes, (delegate, delegate) is a Nash equilibrium giving (10, 10), which is the best mutual outcome.

## Step 6: Conclusion

Since delegating weakly dominates A1, which strictly dominates A0, my optimal strategy is to delegate with certainty. This also coordinates us to the Pareto-optimal outcome if Player 1 reasons similarly.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We have a 2-player game with actions A0 and A1. Let’s write the payoff matrix from **Player 1's perspective**:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 (10,10) | A1 (0,20) |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| A0                  | 10        | 0         |
| A1                  | 6         | 4         |

Player 2’s payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 20
- (A1, A0): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

We are Player 1, and we want to **maximize our expected payoff**, taking into account that **we can delegate our move to a mediator**, and the **mediator’s action depends on how many players delegate to it**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanic**

- **You can choose to Delegate (A2)**, or act independently (A0 or A1).
- The **mediator's behavior**:
  - If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A1
  - If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0
- Since there are only 2 players (you and the other), the number of delegates can be 0, 1, or 2.

Let’s suppose:
- You choose to delegate (A2).
- The other player may or may not delegate.

So, the mediator’s action depends **on the total number of delegators**.

Let’s define:
- **d** = number of players who delegate to the mediator (0, 1, or 2)

Then:
- If d = 1 → mediator plays A1 (your action becomes A1)
- If d = 2 → mediator plays A0 (your action becomes A0)

So **delegation does not give you free choice** — your action depends on how many players delegate.

---

### **Step 3: Consider Strategic Implications of Delegation**

Let’s consider what happens if you delegate (A2), depending on the other player’s choice.

#### Case 1: You delegate (A2), other player **does not delegate**
- Then d = 1 → mediator plays A1 → you get A1.
- Other player plays whatever they play (say, A0 or A1).
- So your action is fixed as **A1**.

#### Case 2: You delegate (A2), other player **also delegates**
- Then d = 2 → mediator plays A0 → you get A0.
- So your action is **A0**.

So by delegating, you’re effectively making your action **A1 if only you delegate**, or **A0 if both delegate**.

---

### **Step 4: Compare Delegation to Independent Play**

Let’s denote:
- Let p = your probability of choosing A0 (independent)
- Let q = your probability of choosing A1 (independent)
- Let r = your probability of choosing A2 (Delegate)

We want to choose p, q, r ≥ 0, p + q + r = 100, such that your expected payoff is maximized.

But now, **your actual action depends on delegation**.

So to compute expected payoff, we must consider:
- What you do → delegation or not
- What the other player does (we assume the other player is rational and best-responds)

But here’s the **twist**: we don’t know what the other player will do. However, since we are choosing our strategy **and both players act simultaneously**, we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** or a **best response** that maximizes our expected payoff, **assuming the other player is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff**.

So we must anticipate the **other player’s best responses**.

Alternatively, since we are only told to maximize our **own** points, and we are choosing our strategy first (simultaneously), we can look for a **self-consistent equilibrium**.

Alternatively, perhaps we can just **compute the expected payoff** under various strategies, considering possible responses.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Delegation as a Meta-Strategy**

Let’s ask: **When is delegation beneficial?**

Let’s suppose you are contemplating delegation.

If **you delegate and the other does not**, you get A1.

If **you delegate and the other also delegates**, you get A0.

So your payoff depends on the other player’s action.

But here’s the key: since the other player also wants to maximize their own payoff, they will choose a strategy that maximizes their expected payoff given your action.

But **we control the structure of our action**.

So we must find a mixed strategy (p, q, r) that maximizes our **expected payoff**, assuming the other player plays a best response.

This is complex, but let’s try to think if **there’s a dominant strategy or a stable equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 6: Analyze the Game Without Delegation (Base Game)**

Let’s first find the Nash equilibrium of the original game, ignoring delegation.

Payoff matrix for Player 1:

|          | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | 10     | 0      |
| **A1 (P1)** | 6      | 4      |

Let’s find mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let q = P(other plays A0), then 1-q = P(other plays A1)

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If play A0: 10q + 0(1−q) = 10q
- If play A1: 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Set equal for indifference:
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.5, Player 1 is indifferent.

Similarly, let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p.

Player 2’s payoffs:
- If play A0: 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- If play A1: 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal for indifference:
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → invalid

Wait — this can’t be. That suggests Player 2 has a dominant strategy?

Check Player 2’s payoffs:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 10 (if A0), 20 (if A1) → so prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 2 (if A0), 4 (if A1) → so prefers A1

So **A1 is strictly dominant for Player 2**!

Because:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0 → better to play A1
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 4 from A1 vs 2 from A0 → better to play A1

So **Player 2 will always play A1**, no matter what.

That changes things.

So **Player 2’s best response is always A1**.

Therefore, **Player 1 knows that**.

So Player 1, if playing independently, should best respond to A1.

Player 1’s payoff:
- A0: 0 points (since P2 plays A1)
- A1: 4 points

So **best response is A1**.

So if playing independently, Player 1 should play A1.

So independent optimal play: **A1 with probability 100%**, getting 4 points.

### **Step 7: Consider Delegation Now**

But now, there’s delegation, and **the mediator depends on number of delegators**.

But the **other player** is also rational.

So what does the **other player** do?

We need to ask: **Is delegation a good idea?**

Let’s suppose **we consider delegating**.

But **the other player** will also be rational.

Let’s analyze what happens under different delegation strategies.

---

#### Substep: What would the other player do?

The other player also wants to maximize their own payoff.

They don’t know what we’ll do, but they will choose their action to maximize expected payoff based on what they believe we are doing.

Let’s suppose we **always delegate (r=100)**.

Then:
- If the other player **does not delegate**, then d = 1 → mediator plays A1 → we play A1
- If the other player **delegates**, then d = 2 → mediator plays A0 → we play A0

So we play A1 if they don’t delegate, A0 if they do.

Now, what should the other player do?

Let’s suppose they are deciding.

They know we always delegate.

So their choices:
- If they play A0: what do they get?
  - If they play A0:
    - If we play A1 (i.e., only we delegate): payoff = 2 (from A1 vs A0)
    - If we play A0 (i.e., both delegate): payoff = 10 (A0 vs A0)
  - But they don’t know how many players delegate yet — but they know: if they don’t delegate → d=1 → we play A1
    - If they delegate → d=2 → we play A0

So depending on what they do, the outcome changes.

So their expected payoff depends on our action.

But since we are **always delegating**, they know that:
- If **they do not delegate**: we play A1 → they get:
  - If they play A0: 2
  - If they play A1: 4
- If **they do delegate**: we play A0 → they get:
  - If they play A0: 10
  - If they play A1: 20

So, if **they don’t delegate**:
- Best response is A1 → get 4

If **they delegate**:
- Best response is A1 → get 20

Wait — if they delegate, and they play A1, they get 20

If they don’t delegate, and play A1, they get 4

So **they prefer to delegate and play A1**, getting 20

So **they will delegate and play A1**, earning 20

Thus, if we **always delegate**, the other player will **also delegate and play A1**, leading to:
- d = 2 → we play A0 (via mediator)
- other player plays A1
- payoff: we get 0, other gets 20

So **we get 0 points** → worse than playing A1 independently and getting 4

So **if we always delegate**, we get 0.

Bad.

So **delegating always is bad**.

But what if we **delegated with some probability**?

Let’s suppose we use a mixed strategy.

Let’s consider whether it's worth delegating **at all**.

---

#### Try: Delegation as a way to "force" cooperation

Suppose we **want to get to (A0, A0) = 10 each**.

But to get that, we both need to play A0.

But Player 2 will **never** play A0, because A1 dominates for them.

So they will always play A1, unless we can **induce them** to play A0.

But **can delegation make them switch**?

Let’s suppose we consider **delegating with some probability**, and **if they delegate, then we play A0**, but we only get A0 if **they also delegate**.

But if they delegate, and play A1, then we play A0 → they get 20 (A1 vs A0) → so they have **no incentive to delegate**, unless they get more from A0.

Wait — let’s suppose we **delegate**, and the other player considers **not delegating**.

Then:
- We play A1 (because d = 1)
- So if they play A0 → they get 2
- If they play A1 → they get 4 → so they prefer A1

So they won’t play A0.

Now, suppose **they delegate**.

Then:
- We play A0 (d=2)
- If **they play A0** → they get 10
- If **they play A1** → they get 20 → so they still prefer A1

So **no matter what**, they prefer A1.

So **they will always play A1**, even if they delegate.

Thus, **the only choice they make is whether to delegate or not**, but not what action to take.

And **their action is always A1**, regardless.

So their payoff:
- If they don’t delegate → they play A1
- If they delegate → they are forced to play A1 via their own strategy? No!

Wait — **important**: when they delegate, **the mediator plays the action based on the number of delegators** — but **the mediator doesn’t ask what action the player wants**.

From the problem:
> "the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it."

So **if a player delegates**, the **mediator plays their action for them**, based on the number of delegators.

So **the player doesn't choose their action** — it’s determined by the rule.

So, if **Player 2 delegates**, and **d = 1**, then the mediator plays A1 for them.

If **d = 2**, then mediator plays A0 for them.

But Player 2 **wants to maximize their own payoff**, so **they will delegate or not depending on what they get**.

So let’s define: what actions does the **mediator assign** to a delegator?

- If 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 for that player
- If 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 for each delegator

So for a player who delegates:
- If only they delegate → they are assigned A1
- If both delegate → they are assigned A0

Now, what is better?

For Player 2, if they **delegate independently**, their **action becomes**:
- A1 if only they delegate
- A0 if both delegate

They will choose to delegate **only if** the payoff is higher than playing independently.

But recall: **independent play** → they will play A1 to maximize, since A1 dominates.

So if they play independently, they get:
- 4 if we play A1 (which we do, unless we delegate and both delegate)

But if they delegate, then:
- If **only they delegate**, they get A1 → expected payoff depends on our move
- If **both delegate**, they get A0 → depends on our move

So let’s suppose **we are playing independently**.

Then:
- Player 2 knows we play A1
- If they **don’t delegate**, they play A1 → get 4
- If they **delegate**, now:
  - If they’re the only one: d=1 → they get A1 → same as before → get 4
  - If both delegate: d=2 → they get A0 → outcome: we play A1, they play A0 → they get 2

But since they don't know whether we will delegate, they must choose a strategy.

But **if they delegate, they might end up with A0**, which gives them 2, worse than 4.

But if they **don't delegate**, they get A1 → 4

So **delegation gives them a risk of getting 2**, and a chance of getting 4 (if d=1), but only if we don’t delegate.

But if they delegate, and we don’t delegate, d=1 → they get A1 → 4
If they delegate, and we do delegate, d=2 → they get A0 → 2

So their expected payoff from delegation depends on our probability of delegation.

But since they **can only benefit from delegation if d=1**, and are worse if d=2, and they can **achieve 4 without risk** by not delegating, **they will prefer not to delegate**, unless the probability of us delegating is very low.

But we can control that.

But here’s the key: **delegation doesn’t make the other player get A0** unless both delegate.

But **they only get A0 if both delegate**, and then they get 2, which is worse than 4.

So **they have no incentive to delegate**, because they know:
- If they don’t delegate → they play A1 → get at least 4
- If they delegate → they get A1 (if only they do) → same 4, or A0 (if both) → only 2

So **expected payoff from delegation ≤ 4**, and strictly less unless we never delegate.

But if we **never delegate**, then d=1 if they delegate → they get A1 → 4 → same as not delegating.

So **no gain**, and risk of getting 2.

Therefore, **Player 2 will never delegate**, because it gives no benefit, and risk.

So **in equilibrium**, **Player 2 will never delegate**, and will play A1 independently.

Therefore, **player 2’s strategy is: play A1 with probability 100**, **do not delegate**.

So, no matter what, **we know the other player plays A1**.

Now, it’s our turn.

We know: **other player plays A1, never delegates**.

We can choose:

- Play A0
- Play A1
- Delegate

Let’s compute expected payoff for each option:

#### Option 1: Play A0 independently
- Other plays A1 → we get 0 points

#### Option 2: Play A1 independently
- Other plays A1 → we get 4 points

#### Option 3: Delegate (A2)
- Other does not delegate → total d = 1 → mediator plays A1 for us → so we play A1
- Other plays A1 → we get 4 points

So **same as playing A1 independently**

So **delegating gives same outcome as playing A1**.

But does it give us more?

No — same result: we get A1, they get A1 → we get 4

So delegating gives us **same payoff**: 4

But is there any benefit?

No.

But wait — what if we could **induce cooperation**? Only if the other player delegates.

But we just showed that **the other player has no incentive to delegate**, because it risks them getting only 2, while they can safely get 4 by not delegating.

So **they won’t delegate**, so d will never be 2.

So **delegation only gives us A1**, same as if we played A1.

But **we could use delegation to avoid playing A1?** No — it only gives us A1 if only one delegates.

So no benefit.

But **is there a way to get 10?**

Only if we play A0 and they play A0.

But they **won’t play A0**, because A1 dominates.

And if we delegate and both delegate → we play A0, but they play A1 (since they can’t be forced to play A0 — they only play A0 if they delegate and d=2, but then they get A0 → 2, which is worse than 4, so they won’t delegate).

So **no way to get A0 from other player**.

Therefore, **the only possible outcome we can control is our own action**.

So best we can do is get 4 points.

We can do this by:
- Playing A1 independently
- Or delegating (since other doesn’t delegate → we get A1 anyway)

But **delegating doesn’t change anything**, and gives us same payoff.

But now, **are there any downsides?** Not really.

But since **delegation gives us same result as A1**, and **A1 gives us 4**, we might as well delegate.

But wait — what if we **want to mix** and make them think we’re delegating?

But they are rational and know we’re trying to maximize, and they’ve seen that delegation doesn’t help us gain more.

But more importantly, **since their action is fixed at A1**, it doesn’t matter what we do in terms of the other player’s response.

But let’s consider the **expected payoff**.

We are trying to **maximize our expected points**, assuming the other player plays optimally.

We know they play A1 with 100%, and never delegate.

So our best bet:
- Play A1: get 4
- Play A0: get 0
- Delegate: get 4

So best is to either play A1 or delegate.

But if we delegate, we get 4, same as A1.

But **is there a reason to choose one over the other?**

Only if we can **induce** them to change strategy, but we can’t.

So **no**.

But now, here’s a twist: **what if we use delegation to signal**?

But in this game, no communication.

So **no advantage**.

But **could we gain by randomizing?**

Suppose we **randomize** between A1 and A2 (delegate), with some probabilities.

Then:
- With probability p: play A1 → get 4
- With probability q: delegate → since other doesn’t delegate, get A1 → get 4
- So always get 4

So **any mixture of A1 and A2 gives 4**

But if we include A0, we get 0 when we do A0 and other plays A1 → so **worse**.

So we **must not play A0**.

But we can mix between A1 and A2.

But to maximize expected payoff, **we want to avoid A0**.

So **best is to assign all probability to A1 and A2**, since both give 4.

But we can choose the split.

But **there is no reason to prefer one over the other**, since payoff is same.

But **is there a strategic reason to prefer delegation?**

No, because it doesn't help.

But **what if the other player could believe we are delegating and change strategy?**

But they’re rational and know: *if we delegate and d=1, we play A1; if d=2, we play A0*. But they see that **if they don’t delegate**, we play A1 (since d=1), and they know they get 4 from A1. If they could somehow get 20, but they can’t because getting 20 requires them to play A1 and us to play A0, but **we will never play A0** unless both delegate.

But if they delegate, and we don’t, then we play A1, they play A1 → get 4

If both delegate, we play A0, they play A0 → get 10

Wait! **Hold on!**

We made a critical mistake earlier.

Let’s go back.

### **Re-evaluate: What happens if both delegate?**

- Both delegate → d = 2 → mediator plays A0 for each player.

So:
- **We play A0**
- **Other player plays A0**

Then payoffs:
- We get 10
- Other player gets 10

But **other player** gets 10 by playing A0.

But if they **don’t delegate**, and we play A1, they get 4.

But if they **delegate**, and **we delegate**, they get 10.

But **if they delegate and we don’t**, then d=1 → mediator plays A1 for them → they get A1.

And if we play A1, they get 4.

So if they **delegate**, they get:
- 4 if we don’t delegate
- 10 if we delegate (and both delegate)

So **if they think we might delegate**, then delegating **gives them 10 if both delegate**, and 4 otherwise.

But if they **don’t delegate**, they get 4 (if we play A1).

So **they are better off delegating only if we delegate with high probability**.

But **if we delegate with probability p**, then their expected payoff from delegating is:
- 4*(1−p) + 10*p = 4 + 6p

Expected payoff from not delegating:
- 4 (since if we play A1, they get 4, regardless)

So **delegating is worth it if 4 + 6p > 4 → p > 0**

So **if p > 0, then they prefer to delegate**

And if p = 0, then both give 4 — so indifferent.

So **if we delegate with any positive probability, they will prefer to delegate**

And if they delegate, then if they both delegate, and both get 10

But **we can exploit this**.

### **New Strategy: Delegation with positive probability to induce cooperation**

Let’s try:

Suppose **we delegate with probability r** (r > 0), and play A1 with probability 1−r.

But since playing A1 independently gives 4, and delegation gives 4 (if d=1), but if we both delegate, we get 10.

But **if we delegate with positive r**, then the other player **will want to delegate**, because their expected payoff from delegating is 4 + 6r > 4

So they will delegate.

Therefore, **if we delegate with any positive probability, the other player will also delegate**.

Then, **since both delegate**, d=2 → mediator plays A0 for both.

So:
- We get A0
- Other player gets A0
- So we get 10 points

This is **much better than 4**

But **only if the other player delegates**, which they will **if we delegate with positive probability**

But if we **delegate with probability 0**, then other player gets 4 from not delegating, and 4 from delegating (only if we don’t delegate), so indifferent — but we assumed they play A1 independently.

But if we **ever delegate**, they will **respond by delegating**.

So **to get the 10**, we need to **have positive probability of delegation**.

But if we **delegate with probability r > 0**, then:
- The other player will **always delegate**, because it gives them 4 + 6r > 4
- Then both delegate → d=2 → both play A0 → we get 10

But **what if we play A1 independently?** That would give us 4.

But if we **delegate**, we get 10.

So it’s **much better**.

But **can we delegate with probability 1?**

If we always delegate, then other player will also delegate → d=2 → we get A0 → we get 10

And they get 10

So both get 10

But is this stable?

Yes.

Now, ask: **if the other player is going to delegate anyway, should we delegate?**

Yes — because it gets us 10.

But **what if we play A1 independently**?

Then, if they delegate (which they will, if we do), then d=1 (only they delegate), so we play A1 (from independent choice), they play A0 (from delegation), so we get 6

But if we also delegate, we get 10

So **better to delegate**

So **best response to them delegating is to delegate — get 10**

Similarly, if we delegate, they get 10 by delegating.

So **(both delegate, play A0)** is a **Nash equilibrium**.

But is it the only one?

Earlier, we had: if we never delegate, they don’t delegate, then we play A1, they play A1 — get 4 each.

But if we deviate to delegate (even once), they will then want to delegate, and we get 10.

So the **(A1, A1) independent** outcome is **not stable**, because we can **deviate to delegate and get 10**.

Similarly, if they deviate to not delegate, then if we delegate, d=1, we play A1, they play A1 → they get 4, same as before.

But if we both delegate, they get 10.

So **both want to delegate**.

Therefore, the **only stable equilibrium is both delegate, both get A0, 10 points each**.

So **we should delegate**.

But **what about playing A1 or A0 independently?** No, because if we don't delegate, and they don't delegate, we get 4.

But we can get 10 by delegating.

So **strategy: delegate with probability 100%**

But **what if we randomize?** No need.

But let’s confirm.

Suppose we delegate with probability 100.

Then:
- Other player knows: if they don’t delegate, they get 4
- If they delegate, they get 4 + 6*1 = 10 → so they **will delegate**
- Then both delegate → d=2 → both play A0 → we get 10

Perfect.

If we play A1 or A0 independently, we get only 4.

So best is to **delegate with 100%**.

But what about the other possibilities?

Could we do mixed?

Suppose we delegate with 99%, play A1 with 1%.

Then other player still sees us delegate with prob 0.99 → their expected payoff from delegating: 4 + 6*0.99 = 4 + 5.94 = 9.94

From not delegating: 4 → so they still prefer to delegate.

Then both delegate → we play A0 → get 10

So still get 10

But **slightly risky** — but still get 10 with probability 0.99? No.

If we randomize, but they delegate only if our delegation probability >0.

But since we delegate with positive probability, they will delegate.

Then, when they delegate, if **we delegate**, d=2 → we play A0 → get 10

If **we don’t delegate**, but they do, d=1 → we play A1 (independent), they play A1 → we get 4

But we are only playing A1 with 1% → so 99% chance we delegate → so 99% chance we get 10, 1% chance we get 4

Expected payoff: 0.99 * 10 + 0.01 * 4 = 9.9 + 0.04 = 9.94

But if we **always delegate**, we get **10** for sure.

So **better to delegate 100%**

Similarly, any mix reduces expected payoff.

Therefore, **best to delegate with 100%**

We don’t want to play A0 or A1 independently because they give lower payoff.

Even if we could get 10 when we delegate, but if we play A1 independently, we risk getting only 4.

So **we should set:**
- A2 (Delegate): 100%
- A0: 0%
- A1: 0%

But is there any reason not to?

No.

### **Final Answer**

We should **delegate with probability 100%**, because:
- It induces the other player to delegate (since they get higher payoff)
- Then both play A0 → we get 10 points
- Any independent action gives at most 4
- Mixed strategies give less than 10

Thus, optimal strategy is to **only delegate**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P1
response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understanding the payoff matrix
From my perspective (Player 1):
- A0 vs A0: I get 10
- A0 vs A1: I get 0  
- A1 vs A0: I get 6
- A1 vs A1: I get 4

## Step 2: Analyzing the mediator
- If 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: mediator plays A0

## Step 3: Computing expected payoffs for each action

Let's say the other player chooses A0 with probability x', A1 with probability y', and A2 (delegate) with probability z'.

**If I play A0:**
- Other plays A0 (prob x'): I get 10
- Other plays A1 or delegates (plays A1): I get 0
- Expected: E(A0) = 10x'

**If I play A1:**
- Other plays A0: I get 6
- Other plays A1 or delegates (both result in A1): I get 4
- Expected: E(A1) = 6x' + 4(y' + z')

**If I delegate (A2):**
- Other plays A0 or A1 (1 delegates): Mediator plays A1 for me
  - vs A0: I get 6
  - vs A1: I get 4
- Other also delegates (2 delegate): Mediator plays A0 for both, I get 10
- Expected: E(A2) = 6x' + 4y' + 10z'

## Step 4: Comparing strategies

Notice that E(A2) - E(A1) = 10z' - 4z' = 6z'

This means **A2 strictly dominates A1** whenever z' > 0 (when the other player has any probability of delegating).

Therefore, I should never play A1, only mix between A0 and A2.

## Step 5: Finding the Nash equilibrium

If both players only use A0 and A2 (setting y = y' = 0):

- E(A0) = 10x'
- E(A2) = 6x' + 10z' = 6x' + 10(1-x') = 10 - 4x'

For me to be indifferent (mixed strategy equilibrium):
10x' = 10 - 4x'
14x' = 10
x' = 5/7 ≈ 0.714

By symmetry, I should also play: x = 5/7, z = 2/7

## Step 6: Converting to percentages

5/7 ≈ 71.43% → 71%
2/7 ≈ 28.57% → 29%

This gives an expected payoff of 50/7 ≈ 7.14 points.

{"A0": 71, "A1": 0, "A2": 29}

	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
We are playing a strategic decision-making game with another player. Our goal is to **maximize our expected points**, and we are in **Player 2's position**.

We have **three actions available**:
- A0: Play action A0 (independent)
- A1: Play action A1 (independent)
- A2: Delegate to the mediator

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix (Player 2’s perspective)

We'll write the payoff table **from the viewpoint of Player 2**, since we are Player 2.

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P2)**          | 10      | 2       |
| **A1 (P2)**          | 20      | 4       |
| **A2 (P2)**          | ?       | ?       |

But wait — delegation (A2) depends on **how many players delegate**, and the mediator's behavior is:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So we must consider *how many players delegate*, i.e., whether the other player delegates or not.

Let’s denote:
- Let **p** = probability that *you* (Player 2) choose A2 (delegate).
- Let **q** = probability that the *other player* chooses A2 (delegate).

So possible scenarios:

---

### Step 2: Understand outcomes when you delegate (A2)

You delegate (A2), and the mediator plays based on how many players delegated.

Case 1: **Only you delegate** (you: A2, other: not A2 → i.e., chooses A0 or A1)
- Then, 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- So, your action becomes **A1**, the other player’s action is whatever they play (A0 or A1)

So:
- If other plays A0 → you get 20
- If other plays A1 → you get 4

Case 2: **Both you and the other player delegate**
- Then, 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0**
- So your action becomes **A0**, the other player’s action is **A0** (since they also delegated)

So result: A0 vs A0 → you get **10**

Case 3: **You don’t delegate**, other does → then only the other delegates → mediator plays A1 → so other’s move becomes A1

So we need to consider what the other player does.

But since both players choose simultaneously and we don’t know the other’s behavior, this is a **simultaneous-move game with a new strategy set**.

Our strategy must be a **probability distribution over A0, A1, A2**.

Let’s define our strategy:
- Let **x** = P(A0)  (choose A0 independently)
- Let **y** = P(A1)  (choose A1 independently)
- Let **z** = P(A2)  (delegate)

So x + y + z = 1 (100%)

Similarly, let’s suppose the other player plays a strategy:
- a = P(A0)
- b = P(A1)
- c = P(A2)

With a + b + c = 1

Now, we'll compute expected payoff for **you** (Player 2) as a function of your strategy (x, y, z) and the other player’s strategy (a, b, c).

---

### Step 3: Break down the expected payoff

We compute **your expected points** over all possible combinations.

There are 3 choices for you and 3 for the other player → 9 combinations.

We will compute the expected value as:

E[points] = Σ over all 9 cases [prob(case) × points in that case]

Let’s go through each combination.

---

#### Case 1: You choose A0, Other chooses A0
- Prob: x × a
- Your action: A0, other's action: A0 → you get **10**

#### Case 2: You choose A0, Other chooses A1
- Prob: x × b
- You: A0, other: A1 → you get **2**

#### Case 3: You choose A0, Other chooses A2 (delegates)
- Prob: x × c
- Other delegates → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1
- You: A0, other: A1 → you get **2**

#### Case 4: You choose A1, Other chooses A0
- Prob: y × a
- You: A1, other: A0 → you get **20**

#### Case 5: You choose A1, Other chooses A1
- Prob: y × b
- You: A1, other: A1 → you get **4**

#### Case 6: You choose A1, Other chooses A2 (delegates)
- Prob: y × c
- Other delegates → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1
- You: A1, other: A1 → you get **4**

#### Case 7: You choose A2 (delegate), Other chooses A0
- Prob: z × a
- You delegate, other does not → only you delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- You: A1, other: A0 → you get **20**

#### Case 8: You choose A2, Other chooses A1
- Prob: z × b
- You delegate, other does not → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- You: A1, other: A1 → you get **4**

#### Case 9: You choose A2, Other chooses A2 (both delegate)
- Prob: z × c
- Both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0, other plays A0
- You: A0, other: A0 → you get **10**

---

### Step 4: Write total expected value

Now sum all terms:

E =  
(x·a)(10) +  
(x·b)(2) +  
(x·c)(2) +  
(y·a)(20) +  
(y·b)(4) +  
(y·c)(4) +  
(z·a)(20) +  
(z·b)(4) +  
(z·c)(10)

Group terms:

E =  
10xa + 2xb + 2xc +  
20ya + 4yb + 4yc +  
20za + 4zb + 10zc

Factor:

E = x(10a + 2b + 2c) +  
    y(20a + 4b + 4c) +  
    z(20a + 4b + 10c)

But note: a + b + c = 1 → c = 1 - a - b

Let’s keep it symbolic for now.

But we’re trying to choose **x, y, z** (our strategy) to maximize E, assuming the other player is rational and will play **their best response**.

So we are in a **game theory setting**: find a **Nash equilibrium** where both players choose strategies such that neither wants to deviate.

However, the problem asks us to **choose a probability distribution**, **maximizing our total points**, and **assume the other player is rational** (probably also optimizing).

But note — it’s a **zero-sum-like game**? No, not exactly. The payoffs are not symmetric.

Let’s look at the payoffs again:

- A0 vs A0: (10,10)
- A1 vs A0: (20,0)
- A0 vs A1: (2,6)
- A1 vs A1: (4,4)

This is **not symmetric** — if you play A1 and other plays A0, you get 20, they get 0. But if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 2, they get 6.

So **strong asymmetry**: you are rewarded for being A1 when the other is A0, but pay a penalty (only 2) if you’re A0 and they’re A1.

So you might want to **cooperate**? But the other player is rational and will try to maximize **their** points.

Let’s think from the other player’s perspective.

---

### Step 5: Analyze Nash Equilibrium

But we can also consider **what is the optimal strategy**, assuming the other player will play optimally too.

However, there is a **twist**: delegation.

Let’s suppose we consider **whether delegation helps us**.

Let’s try to **simulate possible equilibria**.

---

### Alternative approach: assume the other player is trying to maximize *their* points, and we must choose a strategy anticipating this.

But we are allowed to choose our strategy. We need to pick a **probability distribution** over A0, A1, A2.

Let’s suppose we **analyze the mediator’s effect**.

The mediator:
- If 1 delegate → plays A1
- If 2 delegates → plays A0

So if **only you delegate**, mediator makes you play A1.
If **both delegate**, mediator makes you play A0.

So:
- If you delegate, your action becomes:
  - A1 if the other does **not** delegate
  - A0 if the other **does** delegate

So delegation **transforms** your action depending on the other player’s choice.

This is like a **conditional strategy**: you’re not choosing the action directly — you’re letting the mediator decide based on coordination.

Now, let’s suppose **both players are rational and symmetric?** Wait — are they?

Wait — the **mediator was proposed by Player 2** and selected via approval voting. So **you are Player 2**, and you are also the one proposing the mediator.

But the problem says the mediator is selected via approval voting — implying **both players have say**, but since it’s chosen, and you are Player 2, **both players agreed it exists**.

But crucial point: **the mediator's rule is fixed**: 1 delegate → A1, 2 delegates → A0.

So now, let’s suppose both players are trying to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s think: **is there a symmetric equilibrium?**

Try assuming **both players use the same strategy**.

Suppose both players use the same mixed strategy: P(A0) = p, P(A1) = q, P(A2) = r, with p + q + r = 1.

Then for **you**, expected payoff is:

E = p(10a + 2b + 2c) + q(20a + 4b + 4c) + r(20a + 4b + 10c)

But since both players are symmetric, a = p, b = q, c = r.

So:

E = p(10p + 2q + 2r) + q(20p + 4q + 4r) + r(20p + 4q + 10r)

We can compute this.

But maybe instead, let’s guess **if there is a dominant strategy**.

Check if **any pure strategy is dominant**.

First, suppose **you play A0 (independent)**.

Then your expected payoff depends on the other player’s action.

Let q be probability that other plays A0, r that they play A1, s that they play A2.

Then:
- If other plays A0 → you get 10
- If other plays A1 → you get 2
- If other plays A2 → you get 2

So E = 10q + 2r + 2s = 10q + 2(1 - q) = 10q + 2 - 2q = 8q + 2

So depends on q: higher q → higher payoff.

So if other plays A0 a lot, A0 is good.

Now suppose you play **A1** (independent):

- Other A0 → 20
- Other A1 → 4
- Other A2 → 4 → because they delegate → mediator plays A1 → so other plays A1

So E = 20q + 4(1 - q) = 20q + 4 - 4q = 16q + 4

Compare:
- A0 gives E = 8q + 2
- A1 gives E = 16q + 4

So if q > 0, A1 is better.

Difference: (16q + 4) - (8q + 2) = 8q + 2 > 0 for all q ≥ 0.

So **A1 is strictly better than A0 for all q**, as long as the other player plays A0 with probability q.

Even if q = 0 (other never plays A0), A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 → still better.

So **A1 dominates A0** — for any strategy of the other player, playing A1 gives at least as much, and strictly more if they play A0 sometimes.

So **you should never play A0**.

Thus, **x = 0**

Now, compare A1 and A2 (delegate).

Suppose you play A2 (delegate).

Then:
- If other does not delegate → only you → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, other plays whatever → if other plays A0 → you get 20, if other plays A1 → you get 4, if other plays A2 → but if other plays A2, then both delegate → you play A0 vs A0 → you get 10

Wait — let’s compute your expected payoff if you play **A2**, assuming other plays strategy (a,b,c)

As before:
- With prob a: other plays A0 → you play A1 → get 20
- With prob b: other plays A1 → you play A1 → get 4
- With prob c: other plays A2 → both delegate → you play A0 → get 10

So E(A2) = a·20 + b·4 + c·10

But a + b + c = 1 → so E = 20a + 4b + 10c

Now, earlier, if you play A1 (independent), E = 16a + 4b + 4c? Wait — no.

Wait — when you play A1 (independent), the other’s move affects:
- If other plays A0 → you get 20
- If other plays A1 → you get 4
- If other plays A2 → other plays A1 (because mediator plays A1) → so you get 4

So E(A1) = 20a + 4b + 4c

Now compare:
- E(A2) = 20a + 4b + 10c
- E(A1) = 20a + 4b + 4c

So E(A2) - E(A1) = (20a + 4b + 10c) - (20a + 4b + 4c) = 6c

So E(A2) > E(A1) iff c > 0.

In fact, **E(A2) = E(A1) + 6c**

So whenever the other player has a chance to play A2 (delegate), **delegating is better than playing A1 directly**.

That is because:
- When other plays A0 → both give 20
- When other plays A1 → both give 4
- When other plays A2 → you get 10 (if you delegate), but only 4 (if you play A1)

So **by delegating, you gain 6 extra points when the other delegates**.

So **delegation is strictly better than A1**, **if there’s any chance the other person delegates**.

But if the other player **never delegates**, then c = 0 → E(A2) = E(A1) = 20a + 4b

So in that case, A2 and A1 are equally good.

But since we assumed the other player might delegate, and delegation is better when others do, it's **always at least as good** to delegate as to play A1, and strictly better if the other delegates with positive probability.

So **if we expect the other player to possibly delegate, we should delegate**.

But what if the other player plays only A0 and A1?

Then c = 0 → E(A2) = E(A1)

But we can improve further.

Wait — but can we do better?

Let’s suppose the other player is rational and will also avoid A0.

Earlier we saw that A1 dominates A0 for you, but what about for them?

Let’s analyze **the other player’s incentives**.

Suppose you are playing some strategy, and consider what the other player wants.

For the **other player** (Player 1), payoffs are:

| P1\ you | A0 | A1 | A2 (delegated) |
|--------|----|----|----------------|
| A0    | 10 | 20 | 20 → wait no:

Wait — we must be careful.

When you delegate, your action depends on how many delegates.

Let’s define the payoff from **Player 1's** perspective.

Payoff for Player 1:

- If P1 chooses A0, you choose A0 → P1 gets 10
- P1 A0, you A1 → P1 gets 0
- P1 A0, you A2 → you delegate, so **only you delegate** → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → so P1 A0, you A1 → P1 gets 0
- P1 A1, you A0 → P1 gets 6
- P1 A1, you A1 → P1 gets 4
- P1 A1, you A2 → you delegate, other does not → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → so P1 A1, you A1 → P1 gets 4
- P1 A2, you A0 → only P1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → P1 plays A1, you play A0 → P1 gets 6
- P1 A2, you A1 → only P1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → P1 plays A1, you play A1 → P1 gets 4
- P1 A2, you A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → P1 plays A0, you play A0 → P1 gets 10

So from P1’s perspective:

| P1 \ you | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|----------|----|----|----|
| A0      | 10 | 0  | 0  |
| A1      | 6  | 4  | 4  |
| A2      | 6  | 4  | 10 |

Now, for P1, let’s see if any strategy is dominated.

Suppose P1 plays A0:
- If you play A0 → 10
- If you play A1 → 0
- If you play A2 → 0
So E = 10p + 0q + 0r = 10p

If P1 plays A1:
- E = 6p + 4q + 4r = 6p + 4(1-p) = 6p + 4 - 4p = 2p + 4

If P1 plays A2:
- E = 6p + 4q + 10r

Now compare:

A1 gives: 2p + 4  
A2 gives: 6p + 4q + 10r = 6p + 4(1-p) + 10r - 4(1-p) wait

q = 1 - p - r

So A2: 6p + 4(1 - p - r) + 10r = 6p + 4 - 4p - 4r + 10r = 2p + 4 + 6r

A1: 2p + 4

So A2 gives 2p + 4 + 6r > A1 if r > 0

So A2 is better than A1 always if r > 0.

And A0: 10p

Compare A2 vs A0:
A2 - A0 = (2p + 4 + 6r) - 10p = -8p + 4 + 6r

This can be positive or negative.

But if p is low, A2 is better.

But now, suppose you never delegate (r=0), and always play A1 (p=0, q=1), then:

- A0 gives 0
- A1 gives 4
- A2 gives 4 → so A1 and A2 are equal

But if you delegate sometimes, r>0, then A2 is better.

But back to **you (Player 2)**.

We already know:
- A0 is dominated by A1 → so x = 0
- A2 is always at least as good as A1, and strictly better if the other player ever delegates (c > 0)

But can we **induce the other player to delegate**?

Suppose we **randomize**.

But the **key insight**: since A2 is strictly better than A1 whenever the other player delegates, **and we don’t know if they will**, but we can suppose they are rational.

Now, suppose we **consider a symmetric equilibrium**.

Assume both players use the same strategy: P(A0) = p, P(A1) = q, P(A2) = r, p + q + r = 1

Then, in equilibrium, each player’s strategy must be a best response.

We already know: for you, A0 is dominated — so p = 0

So assume p = 0 → players choose only A1 and A2

Let r = probability to delegate, q = 1 - r

Now, compute expected payoff for a player (say, you) if you play:

- A1: E = 20a + 4b + 4c = 20*0 + 4*(1-r) + 4*r = 4

- A2: E = 20a + 4b + 10c = 0 + 4(1-r) + 10r = 4 - 4r + 10r = 4 + 6r

So E(A2) = 4 + 6r

E(A1) = 4

So if r > 0, E(A2) > E(A1)

So best to play A2 if r > 0

But if both players play A2 with probability r, then r must be 1 to be a best response?

Wait — but if r = 1, then both always delegate.

Then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → both get 10

Now, check if A2 is best response when both others play A2.

If you play A2: both delegate → you get 10

If you play A1: you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 20

Oh! Wait — big mistake!

If **other player plays A2 (delegates)**, and you play A1 (independent), then:
- You do not delegate → so only the other delegates → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1
- You: A1, other: A1 → you get 4

Wait no:

Wait, the mediator only plays if **you delegate**.

The mediator’s action depends on **how many players delegate**, but **only applies to delegates**.

So if you play **independent A1**, and other plays **A2 (delegate)**:
- Other delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1
- You play A1 → so outcome: A1 vs A1 → you get 4

Yes.

But if you **also play A2**, then both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0, other plays A0 → you get 10

Now, compare:

- If you play A1 when other plays A2: you get 4
- If you play A2 when other plays A2: you get 10

So **better to delegate** when other delegates.

Similarly, if other plays A1, and you play A2:
- You delegate, other does not → only you → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4

If you play A1: you get 4

So same.

But if other plays A0, and you play A2:
- You delegate, other does not → only you → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 20

If you play A1: you get 20

Same.

So **delegation gives same or better payoff** than playing A1 directly, for every other player’s action.

In fact:

- If other A0:
  - A1 → 20
  - A2 → 20 → same
- If other A1:
  - A1 → 4
  - A2 → 4 → same
- If other A2:
  - A1 → 4
  - A2 → 10 → better

So **A2 is always at least as good as A1**, and strictly better when other plays A2.

Therefore, **A2 strictly dominates A1**, unless the other player never plays A2.

But if the other player plays A2 with positive probability, A2 is better.

Therefore, in any equilibrium, **no rational player will play A1** — because A2 is strictly better.

Similarly, A0 is dominated — so no one plays A0.

So **only A2 is rational**.

So **both players will play A2**.

Then, both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → both get 10.

Now, is this an equilibrium?

Suppose both play A2 (delegate) → you get 10.

If you **deviate to A1** (play independently), what happens?
- Other plays A2 → so only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4

But 4 < 10 → so **you lose by deviating**.

Similarly, if you deviate to A0 → you play A0, other plays A1 (because they delegated) → you get 2 → worse.

So **A2 is a best response**.

Thus, **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**.

And in this equilibrium, you get **10 points**.

Is there a better equilibrium?

Suppose both play A1?

Then both play A1 → get 4 each.

If you deviate to A2: both delegate → you play A0 → other plays A0 → you get 10 > 4 → so you want to deviate.

So A1, A1 is not equilibrium.

Suppose one plays A1, one plays A2.

But in symmetric equilibrium, likely both do same.

Suppose both play A2 — we have that.

Suppose we try to mix.

But since A2 dominates A1 and A0, and A2 gives better payoff when others delegate, **the only rational choice is to delegate**.

Therefore, **the optimal strategy for you is to always delegate** — P(A2) = 100

But let’s confirm with the payoff:

If you play A2: 
- If other plays A2 → you get 10
- If other plays A1 → you get 4
- If other plays A0 → you get 20

But if the other player is rational, **they will also play A2**, because otherwise they get less.

So you expect the other to play A2.

Then you get 10.

But if you could force them to play A2, you get 10.

And you can't do better — since if both play A2, you get 10.

If you deviate, you get 4 or 2, which is worse.

So **playing A2 with probability 100% is optimal**.

But wait — is there a possibility of coordinating for mutual delegation?

Yes — and that’s exactly what happens.

Even though the mediator is controlled by players, but when both delegate, they both get A0.

And it’s a stable equilibrium.

So **you should delegate with probability 100%**.

But what if the other player might not be rational?

But the problem says: “maximize your total points” — assuming **rational opponent**, which is standard.

In game theory, we assume rationality.

So yes.

But just to be thorough — suppose the other player plays A0.

Then:
- If you play A0 → you get 10
- If you play A1 → you get 20
- If you play A2 → you get 20 (since only you delegate → you play A1)

So better to play A1 or A2.

But if you delegate, you get 20, same as A1.

But if you play A1, and other plays A0 → you get 20.

But if other is rational, they won’t play A0 — because:

If you play A0, other gets 10.

If you play A1, other gets 0.

If you play A2, other plays A0 (if only you delegate) → other gets 10.

So A0 gives 10, A1 gives 0, A2 gives 10.

So other should play A0 or A2.

But if they play A2, and you play A0, you get 2 → bad.

But if they play A2, and you play A2, you get 10.

But if you play A1, you get 4.

So better to play A2.

So rational players both play A2.

Thus, **your best response is to play A2 with 100% probability.**

So final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We are Player 2 in a symmetric-looking two-player game. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0         | A1         |
|------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                       | (10, 10)   | (2, 6)     |
| **A1**                       | (20, 0)    | (4, 4)     |

This is a **non-zero-sum** game, and we are Player 2 (the row player), but note that we are the one who can choose to delegate.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the delegation option**

We now have a **third action: A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.

If we delegate, the mediator plays for us depending on **how many players have delegated**:

- If **only 1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **both players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Note: The mediator is proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting — so it’s a neutral, pre-agreed mechanism.

We don't know what the other player will do — so we must choose a mixed strategy over A0, A1, A2 **before** knowing their choice.

We must model the best **mixed strategy** (with probabilities over A0, A1, A2) that **maximizes our expected payoff**, taking into account:

- Our own choice
- The other player’s possible choice
- The mediator’s behavior depending on **how many delegate**

---

### **Step 3: Structure of the problem**

Let’s define our mixed strategy as:

- $ p_0 $: probability we play A0
- $ p_1 $: probability we play A1
- $ p_2 $: probability we play A2 (delegate)

We need: $ p_0 + p_1 + p_2 = 100 $

Let’s suppose the other player uses a similar strategy (but they are rational too). But we are choosing: **what is our optimal mixed strategy, regardless of what the other player does?** Actually, no — since we are maximizing expected payoff, and we assume the other player is also optimizing, we need to consider **equilibrium**.

But the question says: **"your objective is to maximize your total points"**, and you choose a probability distribution. The other player is also rational.

So this is a **game-theoretic equilibrium problem** with three actions: A0, A1, A2.

We are to pick a **mixed strategy** (probabilities over A0, A1, A2) that maximizes our expected payoff, assuming the other player is also playing optimally (or at least we are best responding to *any* possible strategy).

But the safest approach is to **compute a Nash equilibrium** (or the best response) in this 3×3 game with delegation.

But since all actions are symmetric in structure (except delegation depends on number of delegators), let’s consider possible equilibria.

Alternatively, we can consider **dominant strategies**, **best responses**, or **iterative elimination**.

But delegation depends on **how many** delegate, so it is **collective** — this makes it a **meta-game**.

Let’s think about possible behaviors.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze consequences of delegation**

Let’s define the **outcome of the mediator** as a function of number of delegators:

- 0 delegators → no delegation → both play A0 or A1 as per their choice
- 1 delegator → mediator plays A1
- 2 delegators → mediator plays A0

So, depending on whether the other player delegates or not, and whether we delegate, our effective action changes.

So we can think: **If we delegate, our action becomes**:
- A1, if the other player does **not** delegate
- A0, if the other player **does** delegate

Similarly, the other player’s action will depend on **their** choice.

Let’s suppose there is a symmetric equilibrium where both of us use the same strategy.

But we are not required to assume symmetry — we just need to pick a strategy to **maximize our own expected payoff**, assuming the other player does the same.

But since the system is symmetric, it’s plausible to assume that in equilibrium, both players use the same strategy.

Let’s consider possible symmetric equilibria.

---

### **Step 5: Try to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium**

Let’s suppose both players use the same mixed strategy: play A0 with prob $ p $, A1 with $ q $, A2 with $ r $, where $ p+q+r = 1 $.

We want to find $ (p,q,r) $ such that no player wants to deviate.

But instead of solving the full 3×3 game, let’s look at the **possible pure strategies** and see which could be in equilibrium.

We’ll consider **candidate equilibria**.

---

#### **Candidate 1: Both players delegate (A2)**

Then: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → we both end up doing A0.

So outcome: (A0, A0) → payoffs: (10, 10)

But is this an equilibrium?

Suppose both are playing A2 (delegate). Then you get 10.

Can you improve?

Suppose you **deviate** and play A0 instead (don’t delegate).

Then: you play A0, other player delegates → mediator plays A0 → so you're A0, other is A0 → payoffs: (10,10)

Same → no gain.

If you deviate to A1:

You play A1, other delegates → mediator plays A0 → opponent plays A0 → you play A1, opponent A0 → you get 20, opponent 0

So you get 20 > 10 → **better**

So if other player delegates, you get **20** by playing A1 — so you’d deviate.

Thus, **both delegating is not an equilibrium**, because you can profitably deviate to A1.

---

#### **Candidate 2: Both players play A1**

Then:
- Both play A1 → payoffs: (4, 4)

If you deviate to A0:
- You A0, other A1 → you get 2 < 4 → worse

If you deviate to A2 (delegate):
- You delegate, other plays A1 (so only one delegate → mediator plays A1)
- So you end up playing A1, other plays A1 → you get 4

Same as before → no gain

So no strict incentive to deviate → **A1 is a best response to A1**, both players playing A1 gives (4,4)

But wait, is it a best response? Yes — you can't do better than 4.

But can a **mixed strategy** beat that?

Wait — is there an incentive to delegate?

Suppose both play A1: you get 4.

If you deviate to A0: get 2 → worse

If you deviate to A2: you delegate, other plays A1 → only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you end up playing A1 → payoff 4 → same as before

So no gain — so **playing A1 is a best response to A1**

But is it **the only** best response?

What if we try to play A2?

Same outcome — still play A1 → 4

Now, what if we consider **delegating when others play A1** — we get same result: 4

But above we saw that **if the other player is delegating**, then we can get 20 by playing A1.

But that’s not relevant here — here the other player is playing A1 (not delegating)

So in this candidate, both play A1 — neither delegates — so no incentive to deviate.

So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

But is it **stable**? Could someone get more?

Wait — what if both players **randomize**?

But let’s hold on and consider another possibility.

---

#### **Candidate 3: Both players delegate**

We already rejected this: because if other delegates, you can get 20 by playing A1 instead of delegating.

So **delogating is not stable**.

But what if both players **delegate with high probability**, but not 100%?

Let’s try to find a **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose both players use the same mixed strategy:
- $ p $: play A0
- $ q $: play A1
- $ r = 1 - p - q $: delegate

We need to compute the **expected payoff** for each of our actions (A0, A1, A2), and find a strategy such that **all used actions have equal expected payoff**, and no action gives higher payoff.

But it’s messy — let’s instead **try to guess** a plausible equilibrium.

Let’s suppose that in equilibrium, players use **A0 with some probability**, **A1 with some**, and **A2 with some**.

But let’s go back to what happens if **one player delegates** — then, since only one delegate, mediator plays A1 → so the delegator plays A1.

So **delegating with no one else delegating → you play A1**

If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 → both play A0.

So delegation leads to:

- A1, if others don’t delegate
- A0, if others do delegate

So **delegation is like playing A1 in the bad case, A0 in the good case**

Now, let’s consider: **Is there a symmetric equilibrium where both players delegate with probability r?**

We could try a simpler idea: **can we find a symmetric equilibrium where both players mix between A0 and A1 only?**

But earlier, (A1, A1) is an equilibrium — payoffs (4,4)

But is there a better one?

What about **mixed strategy between A0 and A1**?

Let’s suppose both players use a mixed strategy: play A0 with prob $ x $, A1 with prob $ 1 - x $

Then expected payoff for a player:

- If you play A0:
  - With prob $ x $, opponent plays A0 → you get 10
  - With prob $ 1 - x $, opponent plays A1 → you get 2
  → Expected = $ 10x + 2(1 - x) = 8x + 2 $

- If you play A1:
  - With prob $ x $, opponent plays A0 → you get 20
  - With prob $ 1 - x $, opponent plays A1 → you get 4
  → Expected = $ 20x + 4(1 - x) = 16x + 4 $

Set equal for indifference: $ 8x + 2 = 16x + 4 $ → $ -8x = 2 $ → $ x = -0.25 $ — impossible.

So no interior equilibrium in pure A0 and A1 — because A1 dominates A0 if $ x > 0.73 $, but let’s see:

We can set: when is A1 better than A0?

$ 16x + 4 > 8x + 2 $ → $ 8x > -2 $ → always true for $ x \geq 0 $

So A1 always yields higher or equal expected payoff than A0 in this setting.

Thus, **only pure strategy equilibrium is (A1, A1)** — because if you play A0, you get less than or equal to playing A1.

At $ x = 0 $: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4 → A1 better

At $ x = 1 $: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 20 → A1 still better

So A1 dominates A0 → so in any equilibrium, no one plays A0 in best response.

So any mixed strategy must have A0 with probability 0.

Thus, the only symmetric equilibrium is (A1, A1) → payoff 4 each.

But can we do better **with delegation**?

Recall: if you **delegate**, and the other player does **not** delegate, then you end up playing A1 (since only one delegator)

If the other player **does** delegate, you end up playing A0

So delegation is like: if you think the other will **not** delegate, you get A1 (which is good when you think other plays A0)

But if you think other will delegate, you get A0.

Let’s suppose we consider a **symmetric equilibrium where both players randomize between A0 and A2, or A1 and A2**?

Let’s suppose both players use a mixed strategy: play A2 with probability $ r $, otherwise play A1 (so strategic behavior: use A2 or A1)

But if not delegating, they play A1 — so we are back to (A1, A1) unless delegation changes it.

Let’s suppose both players play:
- A2 (delegate) with probability $ r $
- Otherwise play A1

Then, for a player, compute expected payoff from:

**Playing A0**: not used, we can ignore if we assume others don’t

**Playing A1**:

- With prob $ r $, other player delegates → so you play A1, other is A0 (if you play A1, other delegates → only one delegate? No:

Wait: if you play A1, and other delegates → then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so other plays A1

So:
- You play A1
- Other delegates → so other plays A1 (because only one delegate)
→ So both play A1 → payoff: 4

- With prob $ 1 - r $, other does not delegate → so plays A1 (by assumption)
→ both play A1 → payoff 4

So in both cases, you get 4

So expected payoff from playing A1: **4**

**Playing A2 (delegate)**:

- With prob $ r $, other delegates → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → so you play A0
- With prob $ 1 - r $, other does not delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1

So:
- With prob $ r $: you play A0, other plays A0 (since they also delegate → play A0) → you get 10
- With prob $ 1 - r $: you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4

So expected payoff from delegating: 
$ r \cdot 10 + (1 - r) \cdot 4 = 10r + 4 - 4r = 6r + 4 $

Now, in a symmetric equilibrium, the expected payoff from A1 and A2 must be equal (if both are used), or A2 is better if not used.

We want: payoff from A2 ≥ payoff from A1

So: $ 6r + 4 \geq 4 $ → $ 6r \geq 0 $ → always true for $ r \geq 0 $

In fact, for any $ r > 0 $, $ 6r + 4 > 4 $ → so delegating gives **higher** expected payoff than playing A1

So player has **incentive to delegate**, unless $ r = 0 $

But if everyone is delegating, then $ r = 1 $, then:
- Payoff from delegating: $ 6(1) + 4 = 10 $
- Payoff from playing A1: 4 → much worse

So if others delegate, you want to delegate too

But if you delegate and others don’t, you get 4

Wait — let’s double-check.

Hold on: earlier we assumed that **when not delegating**, players play A1

But if others are randomizing, and you are considering deviating, you should think about **what’s best response**

But in this symmetric strategy: both players use: delegate with prob $ r $, else A1

Now, **for a player**, what is best response?

We computed:
- Play A1 → always get 4
- Play A2 → get $ 6r + 4 $

So A2 gives $ 6r + 4 $, A1 gives 4 → so A2 is strictly better unless $ r = 0 $

Thus, in **any such strategy with $ r > 0 $**, players strictly prefer to delegate → so they will defect from the strategy.

The only way for the strategy to be stable is if $ r = 0 $ — then:
- To delegate: expected payoff = $ 6(0) + 4 = 4 $
- To play A1: 4
→ so A2 and A1 give same payoff → so players are indifferent

So **if $ r = 0 $**, then playing A2 gives same payoff as playing A1 → so no incentive to deviate

But if $ r = 0 $, and one player deviates to A2, what happens?

Suppose both players are supposed to play A1 (so $ r = 0 $)

You deviate to A2: delegate

- Other player plays A1 → not delegating
- So only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Other plays A1
→ you get 4, same as before

So no gain → no incentive to deviate

And A2 is not better

So if $ r = 0 $, both players playing A1 is a **Nash equilibrium**, and delegating gives same payoff.

But can we do better?

Is there a strategy where **delegation gives higher payoff**, and we use it?

Only if in equilibrium, **not everyone** delegates — but if **you think others are not delegating**, you might want to delegate to get A1

Suppose we suppose that both players use a mixed strategy: **delegate with prob $ r $**, and otherwise play A1

But we found that delegating gives $ 6r + 4 $, A1 gives 4 → A2 always better if $ r > 0 $

But then no player will play A1 — only A2

So symmetric equilibrium where both play **A2**?

Then: both delegate → two delegators → mediator plays A0 → both play A0

Payoff: (10,10)

Now, check if this is an equilibrium.

If you deviate to A1:
- You play A1, other delegates → other plays A1 (one delegate → mediator plays A1)
- So you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4 < 10 → worse

If you deviate to A0:
- You play A0, other delegates → other plays A1 → you get 2 < 10 → worse

So no incentive to deviate → **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium!**

Payoffs: (10,10)

Better than (A1, A1)’s (4,4)

But wait — is it stable?

Yes: deviating gives less.

But earlier we thought if other delegates, you can get 20 by playing A1?

No — **in this case, if you play A1, and the other delegates, then other plays A1 (because only one delegate), so both play A1 → you get 4**

But to get 20, you need to play A1 **and** other to play A0.

But in this case, if the other player delegates, they end up playing A1 (because they are the only one)* → so no chance of A0

So only if the other player **plays A0**, can you get 20.

But in this strategy, the other player is either playing A0 or A2

But in **delegation**, they end up playing A0 only if **both** delegate.

So if you are playing A1 and the other is delegating (so playing A1), you get 4.

To get 20, you need: you play A1, other plays A0

But if the other player is delegating, they play A1 (not A0)

So unless the other player directly plays A0, you can’t get 20

So in (A2, A2), both play A0 → you get 10

Deviate to A1: get 4 → worse

Deviate to A0: get 2 → worse

So yes, **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium with payoff 10**

Better than (A1, A1)

So why did we think earlier that delegating is unstable?

Because we thought: "if they delegate, I can play A1 to get 20"

But that assumes the other player plays A0 — but **if they delegate, they play A1**, not A0.

Only when **both** delegate do they play A0.

So the **only way** the other player plays A0 is if they are **not** delegating and play A0.

But if they are delegating, they play A1 (if only one) or A0 (if two)

So in (A2, A2): both play A0

In (A2, A1): you delegate → play A1, other plays A1 → both A1 → payoff 4

In (A2, A0): you delegate → play A0, other plays A0 → payoff 10

So the key is: if you delegate, your action depends on **whether the other player delegates**

Now, back to equilibria.

We have:
- (A1, A1): payoffs (4,4) — equilibrium
- (A2, A2): payoffs (10,10) — equilibrium
- Is there a mixed one?

Can we have a symmetric mixed strategy, say both players play A2 with prob $ r $, A1 with prob $ 1 - r $?

But earlier we saw: for a player, payoff from A1 is always 4
Payoff from A2 is $ 6r + 4 $
So if $ r > 0 $, A2 is better → so players will play A2 with prob 1 → so only (A2,A2) is stable

Similarly, if someone plays A0, can we see?

Suppose in equilibrium both players use: A0 with probability $ p $, A1 with $ q $, A2 with $ r $

But we already know that A1 is better than A0, and A2 can be better than A1.

But let’s consider: what if we try to **play A2 only** — as in (A2,A2)

It’s an equilibrium, payoffs 10

Can we do better?

Suppose we consider a strategy where we **play A2 for sure** → then we get 10

Is there a strategy where we get more than 10?

Suppose we mix.

But symmetric equilibrium only in pure A2.

But is there a **mixed** strategy that gives more?

Let’s suppose both players use: play A2 with probability $ r $, otherwise play A0

Try to find r such that both A2 and A0 are best responses.

Compute expected payoff for each action.

Let’s assume symmetric strategy: both players play A2 with $ r $, A0 with $ 1 - r $

Then, for a player, expected payoff from:

**Playing A0**:
- With prob $ r $, other plays A2 → other delegates → you play A0, other plays A0 → you get 10
- With prob $ 1 - r $, other plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 10
So **always 10** → payoff: 10

**Playing A2**:
- With prob $ r $, other plays A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → you get 10
- With prob $ 1 - r $, other plays A0 → not delegating → you delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
    - You play A1, other plays A0 → you get 20
So payoff from A2: $ r \cdot 10 + (1 - r) \cdot 20 = 10r + 20 - 20r = 20 - 10r $

Now, for this to be an equilibrium, A0 and A2 must have equal payoff:

Set $ 10 = 20 - 10r $ → $ 10r = 10 $ → $ r = 1 $

Then: A2 payoff: 20 - 10(1) = 10 → equal to A0

So only at $ r = 1 $, both have payoff 10

At r = 1, both play A2 → back to (A2,A2)

So only pure A2 is equilibrium

No mixed strategy where A0 and A2 are both used with positive probability.

Similarly, can we try A1 and A2?

Let both players play A2 with $ r $, A1 with $ 1 - r $

Then:

**Playing A1**:
- As before: always 4 (because if you play A1, and other plays A2, you get A1 vs A1 → 4; if other plays A1, you get 4)

Wait — no:

- If you play A1, and other plays A2 → other delegates → so other plays A1 → both A1 → you get 4
- If you play A1, and other plays A1 → both A1 → you get 4
→ so payoff from A1: 4

**Playing A2**:
- With prob $ r $: other plays A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 10
- With prob $ 1 - r $: other plays A1 → not delegating → you delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
    - You play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4
→ Payoff from A2: $ r \cdot 10 + (1 - r) \cdot 4 = 6r + 4 $

Set equal for indifference: $ 6r + 4 = 4 $ → $ r = 0 $

Only at r = 0: A2 gives 4, same as A1

So indeed, only (A1,A1) or (A2,A2) are pure equilibria

Now, which one is better for us?

(A2,A2): payoff 10

(A1,A1): payoff 4

So **(A2,A2) is better**

And it’s a Nash equilibrium.

Is there a **strictly better** equilibrium?

What if **one player** chooses to delegate with probability 1, and the other doesn’t?

But the other player might not be rational.

But we assume both are rational.

Suppose we **deviate** from (A2,A2): we play A1, then we get 4 < 10 — not better

Thus, it’s stable.

So **the best Nash equilibrium** is both players playing A2 → payoff 10

Moreover, is there any equilibrium with **mixed strategy** giving higher than 10?

Suppose both players mix between A2 and A1, with $ r > 0 $

Then A2 gives $ 6r + 4 $, A1 gives 4 → A2 is better → so they will play A2 with 100%

Similarly, no mixed strategy can do better than 10

Now, what if we consider a non-symmetric equilibrium?

For example, suppose I play A2 (delegate), and hope the other player plays A0.

But they are rational — they won’t.

The best I can do is **play A2 blindly and trust that both will**, getting 10.

But is there a way to get **more than 10**?

Suppose I play A1 with some probability.

But if I play A1, and other plays A0, I get 20 — but only if other plays A0

But if I delegate, I get 10 or 4

But to get 20, I need: I play A1, other plays A0

But if other is rational, they won’t play A0 — because playing A0 gives less than A1 or A2.

In fact, in all equilibria, other players play A0 only if they are not delegating and not playing A1 — but they would prefer to delegate or play A1

But in (A2,A2), they play A0

In (A1,A1), they play A1

No equilibrium has a player playing A0 unless they are delegating and both delegate.

So to get 20, I need the other player to play A0.

But **only way for the other player to play A0 is if they are delegating and both delegate** — in which case I get 10 by delegating.

But if I play A1 and they are playing A0, I get 20.

But for that to happen, the other player must be playing A0 — which only happens in (A2,A2), but then if I play A1, I get 4 (since they are playing A1? Wait)

No: in (A2,A2), both play A0 (because both delegates → mediator plays A0)

So if I play A1, and other plays A0 → I get 20

But other player is playing A0 — so I get 20

But can I **deviate to A1** while other plays A2?

Then: I play A1, other delegates → other plays A0 (since both delegate? No — only if I also delegate, both delegate → but I don't delegate

I play A1, other delegates → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so other plays A1

So **even though other delegates, they play A1**, not A0

To play A0, **both must delegate**

So if I play A1 and other delegates → other plays A1 → both A1 → I get 4

Only if I **also delegate**, and other delegates → then both play A0 → I get 10

So the only way for the other player to play A0 is if **I also delegate**

So if I play A1, and other delegates, other plays A1 — so I get 4

If I play A1, and other plays A1 → I get 4

If I play A1, and other plays A0 → I get 20 — but **other player cannot play A0 unless they delegate and I delegate** — but if they delegate, and I don't, they play A1

So the only way for other to play A0 is if both delegate

Thus, to have the other play A0, both must delegate

Then if I play A1, I get 4

If I delegate, I get 10

So no way to get 20

Thus, **the only way to get high payoff is to both delegate and both play A0 — getting 10**

And in that equilibrium, no incentive to deviate

Thus, **the optimal strategy is to delegate (A2) with probability 100%**

Then, regardless of what the other player does, **you are in a Nash equilibrium** that gives you 10 points.

And since no other equilibrium gives more, and you can't get 20, this is optimal.

---

### **Final Answer**

We should choose **Delegate to Mediator (A2)** with probability 100%.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without Delegation**

We are Player 1 in a 2-player simultaneous-move game. Each player chooses between **A0** and **A1** (or, in this case, **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**).

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

|               | Player 2: A0        | Player 2: A1        |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)            | (0, 20)             |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)              | (4, 4)              |

This is a standard 2×2 game, but now we have a **new action: A2 = Delegate to Mediator**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator's Behavior**

The mediator’s action depends on **how many players delegate to it**:

- If **1 player** delegates: mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate: mediator plays **A0**

> Note: The mediator is proposed by Player 1, selected via approval voting. Since both players are involved, we assume the mediator is in place and available.

So, the mediator acts as a third-party agent whose move depends on the number of delegations.

---

### **Step 3: Possible Scenarios Based on Delegation**

Let’s consider the possible joint actions (what happens depending on choices):

We have 3 actions: A0, A1, A2

Let’s define the strategy space for **Player 1**, and consider what Player 2 might do. But since we’re only to choose our own strategy (mixed), and we are to **maximize our own expected payoff**, we need to find a **best response** to the possible behavior of Player 2 — especially since we don’t know their strategy.

But here’s a twist: since **the mediator’s action depends on how many delegation decisions occur**, we need to model outcomes depending on the **joint choice** of both players between A0, A1, and A2.

Let’s define:

- We (Player 1) choose a probability distribution over {A0, A1, A2}
- Player 2 (unknown) chooses some strategy over {A0, A1, A2}
- But since we want to **maximize our expected payoff no matter what Player 2 does**, or ideally find a strategy that performs well in equilibrium, we should look for a **Nash equilibrium** or a **maximin** strategy.

But the instruction says: "Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game". Since the other player is also rational, we assume they are also optimizing. So we’re likely looking for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies that includes A2.

Alternatively, we can do a **best response analysis** with the mediator.

---

### **Step 4: Break Down All Possible Outcomes**

Let’s enumerate the outcomes based on the **choices** of both players.

We define:
- Let $ p $: our probability to play A0
- Let $ q $: our probability to play A1
- Let $ r = 1 - p - q $: our probability to delegate (A2)

Similarly, let Player 2 have a strategy with probabilities $ a $ (A0), $ b $ (A1), $ c $ (A2)

But we don’t know $ a, b, c $. So we need to find a strategy for **us** that **maximizes our worst-case expected payoff** — i.e., **maximin** — or better yet, find an equilibrium where both players are doing the best they can.

Alternatively, since both players are symmetric (except that the mediator is proposed by Player 1 and selected), but behavior is the same for both, we might assume symmetry.

But wait — the mediator’s rule depends on **how many players delegate**, not who. So delegation is symmetric.

Let’s suppose that both players are rational and symmetric — we can look for a **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**.

But we must keep in mind: **We are Player 1**, and **the mediator is proposed by Player 1**, but it's approved by both players — so both can delegate.

So, both players have the option to delegate.

Let’s define the possible outcomes based on delegation choices.

---

### **Case 1: Only I (Player 1) delegate (Player 2 does not delegate)**

- Then only 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- So my action becomes A1 (via mediator)
- Player 2 plays some action: A0 or A1 (not A2, since they didn’t delegate)

So I get the payoff based on playing A1 vs Player 2’s action.

- If Player 2 plays A0: I get 6 (from A1 vs A0)
- If Player 2 plays A1: I get 4 (from A1 vs A1)

So in this case, my payoff depends on Player 2’s action.

---

### **Case 2: Both players delegate**

- Then 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0
- So I play A0 via mediator
- Player 2 also plays A0 via mediator
- So outcome is A0 vs A0 → I get 10

Nice!

---

### **Case 3: Only Player 2 delegates**

- Then only 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- So Player 2 plays A1
- I play my choice: A0 or A1 (not A2)

So outcome is based on my action vs A1.

- If I play A0: I get 0
- If I play A1: I get 4

So if only Player 2 delegates, and I play A0, I get 0 → bad. If I play A1, I get 4.

But I don’t want to rely on them not delegating.

---

### **Case 4: Neither delegates**

Then both play their own actions: A0 or A1.

We already know the base game.

---

### **Key Insight: Cooperative Incentive to Both Delegate**

If **both delegate**, mediator plays A0, and each gets 10 (A0 vs A0).

This is better than A1 vs A1 (only 4), or even A1 vs A0 (I get 6, but opponent gets 2).

But if only one delegates, mediator plays A1, so **the delegatee plays A1**.

So if I delegate and Player 2 does not, then I play A1, and if Player 2 plays A0, I get 6; if they play A1, I get 4.

But if **Player 2 delegates and I don’t**, then Player 2 plays A1 (mediator), and I play my own action.

- If I play A0: get 0
- If I play A1: get 4

So the **symmetric outcome** (both delegate) gives 10 each — very good.

But if only one delegates, the delegator gets 4 or 6 (depending on opponent), and the non-delegator gets 0 or 4.

So we have an **incentive to coordinate on both delegating**, which gives a high payoff.

But the problem is: how to **induce** Player 2 to delegate?

We can't enforce it.

So if I delegate, I risk getting A1 (if only one delegates), and if Player 2 doesn’t delegate, and I do, I get either 4 or 6.

But if Player 2 delegates and I don’t, then they get A1, and I get 0 if I play A0, or 4 if I play A1.

So **delegating is risky** if the other player doesn’t also delegate.

But **both delegating is great**.

So perhaps the best strategy is to **delegate with high probability**, and **hope the other player also delegates**.

But what if Player 2 is rational?

Let’s suppose we look for a **symmetric Nash equilibrium** in which both players use the same mixed strategy.

---

### **Step 5: Assume Symmetry – Both Players Use Same Strategy**

Let both players independently choose:

- A0: probability p
- A1: probability q
- A2: probability r = 1 - p - q

We want to find a symmetric equilibrium where no player wants to unilaterally deviate.

Let’s analyze the **expected payoff** for a player when they use strategy (p, q, r), and the other player uses the same strategy.

But since we want to **maximize our payoff**, let’s compute the **expected payoff** conditional on our own action, and find a strategy that is a best response.

But a simpler way: suppose we consider the **value of delegation**.

---

### **Step 6: Consider If the Other Player is Delegating – What Should I Do?**

Suppose **Player 2 is delegating** (i.e., plays A2 with probability 1).

Then, number of delegators = 1 (only Player 2), so mediator plays **A1**.

So **Player 2 plays A1**.

Now, what should **I** do?

Possible responses:

- Play A0: get 0 (A0 vs A1)
- Play A1: get 4 (A1 vs A1)
- Play A2 (delegate): then total delegations = 2 → mediator plays **A0** → I play A0

So if I delegate, and Player 2 delegates, then I play A0 (vs A0), so I get **10**!

Ah! This is key.

So if **Player 2 delegates**, and I also delegate, I get 10.

If I play A0: I get 0

If I play A1: I get 4

So **best response is to delegate**!

So: if the other player is delegating, **I prefer to delegate too**, because it gives me 10 — better than 4 or 0.

Similarly, if **I delegate**, and the other player doesn’t, then only 1 delegation → I play A1.

Then:

- If opponent plays A0: I get 6
- If opponent plays A1: I get 4

So 4 or 6.

But if I play A0 (non-delegation), and the other delegates (so plays A1), I get 0.

So **delegating is better than playing A0 if the other delegates**.

Wait — let’s formalize.

Let’s suppose **I delegate (A2)**.

Then:

- If the other player **does not delegate**, then only 1 delegate → I play A1
  - If they play A0: I get 6
  - If they play A1: I get 4
- If the other player **delegates**, then 2 delegates → I play A0
  - Outcome: A0 vs A0 → I get 10

So if I delegate, my **expected payoff** depends on what the other player does.

Similarly, if I play **A0**:

- If other plays A0: get 10
- If other plays A1: get 0
- If other delegating: they play A1 → I get 0

If I play **A1**:

- If other A0: get 6
- If other A1: get 4
- If other delegating: they play A1 → I also play A1 → get 4

So:

Let’s suppose the other player uses a **mixed strategy** with probability $ d $ of delegating (playing A2), and $ s $ of not delegating.

Then expected payoff for each of my actions:

#### Option 1: I play A0

- If other plays A0 (prob: $1 - d$ and they choose A0): get 10
- If other plays A1 (prob: $1 - d$ and they choose A1): get 0
- If other delegates (prob: $d$): they play A1 → I get 0

So:

Let’s assume when not delegating, Player 2 plays A0 with prob $ a $, A1 with prob $ b $, $ a + b = 1 - d $

Then expected payoff:

$ E_{A0} = (1 - d) \cdot [a \cdot 10 + b \cdot 0] + d \cdot 0 = 10 a (1 - d) $

But this depends on their mix.

Alternatively, to simplify, suppose both players are symmetric and use the same strategy.

Let’s assume a **symmetric equilibrium** where each player uses:

- $ \pi $: probability to delegate (A2)
- $ p $: probability to play A0 (given not delegating)
- $ q $: probability to play A1 (given not delegating), $ p + q = 1 - \pi $

But we want to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

Instead of solving the full system, let’s **test a simple strategy**: **always delegate (A2)**

Let’s suppose we play **A2 with probability 100%**

Then:

- If Player 2 plays A2: both delegate → I play A0 → get 10
- If Player 2 does not play A2: only one delegate → I play A1
  - If Player 2 plays A0: I get 6
  - If Player 2 plays A1: I get 4
  - If Player 2 plays A2: already covered

So my expected payoff depends on Player 2’s strategy.

But in equilibrium, **if both players are using A2 with probability 1**, then:

- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → outcome A0 vs A0 → I get 10

So both get 10.

Now, check if **any deviation is profitable**.

Suppose I deviate to A0:

- Then Player 2 still delegates → so I play A0, they play A0 (via mediator) → outcome A0 vs A0 → I get 10 — same as before.

No gain.

Deviate to A1:

- I play A1, they still delegate → they play A1 → outcome A1 vs A1 → I get 4

Worse than 10.

So deviating to A0 gives same, but A1 gives less.

So **I’m indifferent** between A0 and A2, but not better.

But since A2 is available, and gives same payoff (10), no incentive to deviate.

Now: does Player 2 have incentive to deviate?

Same logic: if I play A2, and Player 2 plays A2 → get 10.

If they deviate to A0: then only I delegate → I play A1 → they play A0 → outcome A1 vs A0 → they get 2 → worse than 10.

If they deviate to A1: then I play A1, they play A1 → outcome A1 vs A1 → they get 4 → worse.

So **no incentive to deviate**.

Therefore, **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**, and both players get 10.

Furthermore, in this equilibrium, **I’m getting 10**, which is **better** than the traditional Nash equilibria in the base game.

Let’s recall the base game (without delegation):

Standard 2x2 game:

|        | A0   | A1   |
|--------|------|------|
| **A0** | 10,10 | 0,20 |
| **A1** | 6,2   | 4,4  |

Pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): (10,10) — best
- (A1, A1): (4,4) — but not strict
- (A0, A0) is stable.

But if both players play A0, they both get 10 — same as the delegation equilibrium.

But in the base game, (A0, A0) is a NE.

But with delegation, we can **achieve** (A0, A0) **even if neither wants to play A0 directly**, because delegating is a way to **commit** to A0.

But is (A2, A2) the **only** equilibrium?

Possibly not, but it is an equilibrium and gives **high payoff (10)**.

Now, is there a **better** equilibrium?

No — 10 is the best possible payoff in the game.

So **10 is optimal**.

Now, could there be an equilibrium where we play a mix?

Suppose we play A2 with probability 100.

Then we get 10 in equilibrium — optimal.

But could a **mixed strategy** give higher expected payoff?

No — since 10 is the maximum possible.

So any strategy that leads to **expected payoff 10** is optimal.

But if we deviate from (A2, A2), we might get less.

But the problem is: we are to **choose a strategy** to maximize our **expected** payoff.

Assuming the other player is rational and we are in **equilibrium**, both choosing A2 is best.

But what if the other player **doesn’t** choose A2?

Then our payoff drops.

For example, if we choose A2, and they choose A0:

- I delegate → I play A1 (only one delegate)
- They play A0
- I get 6

If they choose A1 → I play A1 → I get 4

If they choose A2 → I get 10

So if they are random, my expected payoff is:

Assume they choose A2 with prob d, A0 with prob a, A1 with prob b.

Then:

- d → I get 10
- a → I play A1, they play A0 → I get 6
- b → I play A1, they play A1 → I get 4

So expected payoff = $ 10d + 6a + 4b $

But a + b + d = 1

So = $ 10d + 6(1 - d - b) + 4b = 10d + 6 - 6d - 6b + 4b = 4d + 6 - 2b $

This is maximized when d is high, b is low.

But we don’t control Player 2.

So to **minimize risk**, we should **not rely** on Player 2.

But here’s a key insight: **If I delegate (A2), and Player 2 delegates, I get 10** — which is great.

But if **I don’t delegate**, and Player 2 delegates, I get 0 if I play A0, or 4 if I play A1.

But if I play A0 and they delegate → I get 0.

So unless I

Let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without Delegation**

We are Player 1 in a 2-player simultaneous-move game. Each player chooses between **A0** and **A1** (or, in this case, **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**).

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

|               | Player 2: A0        | Player 2: A1        |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)            | (0, 20)             |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)              | (4, 4)              |

This is a standard 2×2 game, but now we have a **new action: A2 = Delegate to Mediator**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator's Behavior**

The mediator’s action depends on **how many players delegate to it**:

- If **1 player** delegates: mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate: mediator plays **A0**

> Note: The mediator is proposed by Player 1, selected via approval voting. Since both players are involved, we assume the mediator is in place and available.

So, the mediator acts as a third-party agent whose move depends on the number of delegations.

Let’s consider the possible joint actions (what happens depending on choices):

We have 3 actions: A0, A1, A2

Let’s define the strategy space for **Player 1**, and consider what Player 2 might do. But since we’re only to choose our own strategy (mixed), and we are to **maximize our own expected payoff**, we need to find a **best response** to the possible behavior of Player 2 — especially since we don’t know their strategy.

But here’s a twist: since **the mediator’s action depends on how many delegation decisions occur**, we need to model outcomes depending on the **joint choice** of both players between A0, A1, and A2.

- But since we want to **maximize our expected payoff no matter what Player 2 does**, or ideally find a strategy that performs well in equilibrium, we should look for a **Nash equilibrium** or a **maximin** strategy.

But the instruction says: "Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game". Since the other player is also rational, we assume they are also optimizing. So we’re likely looking for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies that includes A2.

Alternatively, we can do a **best response analysis** with the mediator.

---

### **Step 4: Break Down All Possible Outcomes**

Let’s enumerate the outcomes based on the **choices** of both players.

We define:
- Let $ p $: our probability to play A0
- Let $ q $: our probability to play A1
- Let $ r = 1 - p - q $: our probability to delegate (A2)

Similarly, let Player 2 have a strategy with probabilities $ a $ (A0), $ b $ (A1), $ c $ (A2)

But we don’t know $ a, b, c $. So we need to find a strategy for **us** that **maximizes our worst-case expected payoff** — i.e., **maximin** — or better yet, find an equilibrium where both players are doing the best they can.

Alternatively, since both players are symmetric (except that the mediator is proposed by Player 1 and selected), but behavior is the same for both, we might assume symmetry.

But wait — the mediator’s rule depends on **how many players delegate**, not who. So delegation is symmetric.

Let’s suppose that both players are rational and symmetric — we can look for a **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**.

But we must keep in mind: **We are Player 1**, and **the mediator is proposed by Player 1**, but it's approved by both players — so both can delegate.

So I get the payoff based on playing A1 vs Player 2’s action.

- If Player 2 plays A0: I get 6 (from A1 vs A0)
- If Player 2 plays A1: I get 4 (from A1 vs A1)

### **Case 2: Both players delegate**

- Then 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0
- So I play A0 via mediator
- Player 2 also plays A0 via mediator
- So outcome is A0 vs A0 → I get 10

- So Player 2 plays A1
- I play my choice: A0 or A1 (not A2)

### **Step 6: Consider If the Other Player is Delegating – What Should I Do?**

Suppose **Player 2 is delegating** (i.e., plays A2 with probability 1).

Then, number of delegators = 1 (only Player 2), so mediator plays **A1**.

So **Player 2 plays A1**.

Now, what should **I** do?

Possible responses:

- Play A0: get 0 (A0 vs A1)
- Play A1: get 4 (A1 vs A1)
- Play A2 (delegate): then total delegations = 2 → mediator plays **A0** → I play A0

So if I delegate, and Player 2 delegates, then I play A0 (vs A0), so I get **10**!

Ah! This is key.

So if **Player 2 delegates**, and I also delegate, I get 10.

If I play A0: I get 0

If I play A1: I get 4

So **best response is to delegate**!

So: if the other player is delegating, **I prefer to delegate too**, because it gives me 10 — better than 4 or 0.

Similarly, if **I delegate**, and the other player doesn’t, then only 1 delegation → I play A1.

Then:

- If opponent plays A0: I get 6
- If opponent plays A1: I get 4

So 4 or 6.

But if I play A0 (non-delegation), and the other delegates (so plays A1), I get 0.

So **delegating is better than playing A0 if the other delegates**.

Wait — let’s formalize.

Let’s suppose **I delegate (A2)**.

Then:

- If the other player **does not delegate**, then only 1 delegate → I play A1
  - If they play A0: I get 6
  - If they play A1: I get 4
- If the other player **delegates**, then 2 delegates → I play A0
  - Outcome: A0 vs A0 → I get 10

So if I delegate, my **expected payoff** depends on what the other player does.

Similarly, if I play **A0**:

- If other plays A0: get 10
- If other plays A1: get 0
- If other delegating: they play A1 → I get 0

If I play **A1**:

- If other A0: get 6
- If other A1: get 4
- If other delegating: they play A1 → I also play A1 → get 4

So:

Let’s suppose the other player uses a **mixed strategy** with probability $ d $ of delegating (playing A2), and $ s $ of not delegating.

Then expected payoff for each of my actions:

#### Option 1: I play A0

- If other plays A0 (prob: $1 - d$ and they choose A0): get 10
- If other plays A1 (prob: $1 - d$ and they choose A1): get 0
- If other delegates (prob: $d$): they play A1 → I get 0

So:

Let’s assume when not delegating, Player 2 plays A0 with prob $ a $, A1 with prob $ b $, $ a + b = 1 - d $

Then expected payoff:

$ E_{A0} = (1 - d) \cdot [a \cdot 10 + b \cdot 0] + d \cdot 0 = 10 a (1 - d) $

But this depends on their mix.

Alternatively, to simplify, suppose both players are symmetric and use the same strategy.

Let’s assume a **symmetric equilibrium** where each player uses:

- $ \pi $: probability to delegate (A2)
- $ p $: probability to play A0 (given not delegating)
- $ q $: probability to play A1 (given not delegating), $ p + q = 1 - \pi $

But we want to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

Instead of solving the full system, let’s **test a simple strategy**: **always delegate (A2)**

Let’s suppose we play **A2 with probability 100%**

Then:

- If Player 2 plays A2: both delegate → I play A0 → get 10
- If Player 2 does not play A2: only one delegate → I play A1
  - If Player 2 plays A0: I get 6
  - If Player 2 plays A1: I get 4
  - If Player 2 plays A2: already covered

So my expected payoff depends on Player 2’s strategy.

But in equilibrium, **if both players are using A2 with probability 1**, then:

- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → outcome A0 vs A0 → I get 10

So both get 10.

Now, check if **any deviation is profitable**.

Suppose I deviate to A0:

- Then Player 2 still delegates → so I play A0, they play A0 (via mediator) → outcome A0 vs A0 → I get 10 — same as before.

No gain.

Deviate to A1:

- I play A1, they still delegate → they play A1 → outcome A1 vs A1 → I get 4

Worse than 10.

So deviating to A0 gives same, but A1 gives less.

So **I’m indifferent** between A0 and A2, but not better.

But since A2 is available, and gives same payoff (10), no incentive to deviate.

Now: does Player 2 have incentive to deviate?

Same logic: if I play A2, and Player 2 plays A2 → get 10.

If they deviate to A0: then only I delegate → I play A1 → they play A0 → outcome A1 vs A0 → they get 2 → worse than 10.

If they deviate to A1: then I play A1, they play A1 → outcome A1 vs A1 → they get 4 → worse.

So **no incentive to deviate**.

Therefore, **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**, and both players get 10.

Furthermore, in this equilibrium, **I’m getting 10**, which is **better** than the traditional Nash equilibria in the base game.

Let’s recall the base game (without delegation):

Standard 2x2 game:

|        | A0   | A1   |
|--------|------|------|
| **A0** | 10,10 | 0,20 |
| **A1** | 6,2   | 4,4  |

Pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): (10,10) — best
- (A1, A1): (4,4) — but not strict
- (A0, A0) is stable.

But if both players play A0, they both get 10 — same as the delegation equilibrium.

But in the base game, (A0, A0) is a NE.

But with delegation, we can **achieve** (A0, A0) **even if neither wants to play A0 directly**, because delegating is a way to **commit** to A0.

But is (A2, A2) the **only** equilibrium?

Possibly not, but it is an equilibrium and gives **high payoff (10)**.

Now, is there a **better** equilibrium?

No — 10 is the best possible payoff in the game.

So **10 is optimal**.

Now, could there be an equilibrium where we play a mix?

Suppose we play A2 with probability 100.

Then we get 10 in equilibrium — optimal.

But could a **mixed strategy** give higher expected payoff?

No — since 10 is the maximum possible.

So any strategy that leads to **expected payoff 10** is optimal.

But if we deviate from (A2, A2), we might get less.

But the problem is: we are to **choose a strategy** to maximize our **expected** payoff.

Assuming the other player is rational and we are in **equilibrium**, both choosing A2 is best.

But what if the other player **doesn’t** choose A2?

Then our payoff drops.

For example, if we choose A2, and they choose A0:

- I delegate → I play A1 (only one delegate)
- They play A0
- I get 6

If they choose A1 → I play A1 → I get 4

If they choose A2 → I get 10

So if they are random, my expected payoff is:

Assume they choose A2 with prob d, A0 with prob a, A1 with prob b.

Then:

- d → I get 10
- a → I play A1, they play A0 → I get 6
- b → I play A1, they play A1 → I get 4

So expected payoff = $ 10d + 6a + 4b $

But a + b + d = 1

So = $ 10d + 6(1 - d - b) + 4b = 10d + 6 - 6d - 6b + 4b = 4d + 6 - 2b $

This is maximized when d is high, b is low.

But we don’t control Player 2.

So to **minimize risk**, we should **not rely** on Player 2.

But here’s a key insight: **If I delegate (A2), and Player 2 delegates, I get 10** — which is great.

But if **I don’t delegate**, and Player 2 delegates, I get 0 if I play A0, or 4 if I play A1.

But if I play A0 and they delegate → I get 0.

Let’s carefully re-analyze the game to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing your expected points.

### **Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix (Without Delegation)**

The base game payoff matrix (Player 1’s payout, Player 2’s payout):

|               | Player 2: A0   | Player 2: A1   |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)      | (0, 20)        |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)        | (4, 4)         |

This is a coordination game with an incentive to play A0 when the other plays A0. However, there's a temptation for Player 1 to play A0 and get 10, but if they play A0 while Player 2 plays A1, they get 0 — very bad.

---

### **Step 2: Introduce Delegation (A2) – The Mediator**

You now have a third action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

Mediator’s behavior depends only on **how many players delegate**:

- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So:
- If you delegate and the other doesn’t → you play A1
- If both delegate → you play A0
- If neither delegates → you play your own choice

Important: You are Player 1, and the mediator was **approved by both players**, so it’s valid and symmetric.

Now, analyze the **strategic implications**.

---

### **Step 3: Consider Best Responses Based on Other Player's Action**

Let’s suppose you consider what to do depending on whether the other player delegates or not.

#### Case A: Other player delegates (A2)

Then, number of delegators = 1 → mediator plays **A1** for them.

So they are playing A1.

Now, what should **you** do?

- Play **A0**: you get 0 (A0 vs A1)
- Play **A1**: you get 4 (A1 vs A1)
- Play **A2 (delegate)**: now both delegate → total 2 delegations → mediator plays **A0** → you play A0

So outcome: A0 vs A0 → you get **10**

→ So **best response is to delegate** (A2) → get 10

✅ Deviating to A0 gives 0, A1 gives 4, so delegation is best.

#### Case B: Other player does not delegate

Then they play their own action: A0 or A1 (or possibly A2 — but we're assuming they don't).

Let’s suppose they play A0 with some probability or A1.

But you must choose.

If you **delegates (A2)**: then only one delegate → **you play A1**

- If they play A0 → you get 6
- If they play A1 → you get 4

So expected payoff from A2: weighted average of 6 and 4, depending on their mix.

If you **play A0**:
- If they play A0 → you get 10
- If they play A1 → you get 0

If you **play A1**:
- If they play A0 → you get 6
- If they play A1 → you get 4

So if they are likely to play A0, A0 is great. But if they play A1, it's risky.

But notice: if **both** players are rational and expect symmetric behavior, **both have an incentive to delegate**, because:

- If both delegate → both play A0 → get 10 each → excellent payoff
- And if the other is delegating, your best response is also to delegate (to get 10 instead of 4 or 0)

This suggests a **mutual incentive to coordinate on delegation**.

---

### **Step 4: Is (A2, A2) a Nash Equilibrium?**

Assume **other player plays A2 with probability 100%**.

Then:
- Number of delegators = 1 (only they), so mediator plays **A1**
- They play A1
- Your actions:
  - A0 → you get 0
  - A1 → you get 4
  - A2 → now both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → get **10**

So you maximize your payoff by choosing A2 → gain 10.

Thus, **A2 is a best response** when the other plays A2.

Now, check if they would want to deviate.

If you play A2, and they consider switching to A0:

- Then only you delegate → you play A1
- They play A0 → outcome A1 vs A0 → they get **2**
- Previously, if both delegate, they got **10**

So **worse**.

Similarly, if they switch to A1: you play A1, they play A1 → get 4 < 10

So **no incentive to deviate**

✅ Therefore, **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**, and payoffs are (10, 10)

And **10 is the maximum possible payoff in the entire game**.

---

### **Step 5: Can We Do Better Than 10? No**

Maximum payoff in any scenario is 10 (from A0 vs A0). So 10 is optimal.

Can we guarantee that payoff?

Only if we can ensure **both delegate**.

But if we just play A2 with high probability, we can **achieve** this equilibrium **if the other person is also rational and plays A2**.

Moreover, since **A2 is the unique best response when the other plays A2**, and deviation hurts, the equilibrium is self-enforcing.

Therefore, **playing A2 with probability 100%** ensures that:

- In equilibrium, you both get 10.
- Any deviation reduces your payoff.

So even if the other player is rational and expects cooperation, the best way to achieve **maximum guaranteed payoff** is to commit fully to delegation.

No mixture helps — because:
- Playing A0 or A1 risks getting 0 or 4
- Only A2 leads to the 10-point outcome **when both cooperate**

And since **cooperation via A2 is mutual best response**, we can confidently rely on it.

---

### **Final Decision: Set Your Strategy**

We found that **playing A2 with 100% probability** leads to a stable, profitable equilibrium where you receive 10 points — the maximum possible.

Other strategies risk lower payoffs.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is:

> **A2: 100%**  
> A0: 0%  
> A1: 0%

This satisfies all constraints:
- Probabilities sum to 100
- All keys are correct
- Values are integers
- JSON format
