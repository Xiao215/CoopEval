Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

To maximize points, we first analyze the base game's payoff matrix (Player 2's payoffs are listed first):

- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3) — P2 chooses A0, P1 chooses A1
- (A1, A0): (3, 0) — P2 chooses A1, P1 chooses A0
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In the base game, both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash equilibria. The outcome (A0, A0) provides the highest total payoff for both players (5 each), but (A1, A1) is a risk-dominant equilibrium.

A contract allows us to introduce additional payments. Given a contract {A0: X, A1: Y}, if Player 2 plays $A_{p2}$ and Player 1 plays $A_{p1}$, the net points for Player 2 will be the base payoff plus $Extra(A_{p2}) - Extra(A_{p1})$. Because the extra payments are drawn from the other player, any scenario where both players choose the same action results in a net exchange of zero, keeping the payoffs at (5, 5) for (A0, A0) and (3, 3) for (A1, A1).

To maximize total points, we want to ensure the players coordinate on the (A0, A0) outcome. By making A0 a dominant strategy, we eliminate the risk of the (A1, A1) equilibrium. For A0 to be a dominant strategy for both players:
1. Payoff(A0, A0) > Payoff(A1, A0) $\implies 5 > 3 + Y - X \implies X - Y > -2$
2. Payoff(A0, A1) > Payoff(A1, A1) $\implies 0 + X - Y > 3 \implies X - Y > 3$

By setting $X=4$ and $Y=0$, we satisfy $X - Y > 3$. The modified payoff matrix becomes:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this scenario, A0 is the strictly dominant strategy for both players, leading them to the (A0, A0) outcome with a payoff of 5 points each. This is the maximum achievable stable payoff in the game, as the sum of points in any other scenario is lower (3 or 6).

response:
To maximize points in this coordination game, we want to ensure both players choose action A0, which yields the highest joint and individual payoff (5, 5). Without a contract, the game has two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). (A1, A1) is often chosen because it is risk-dominant; each player is guaranteed 3 points regardless of the other's action, whereas A0 risks a payoff of 0.

By proposing a contract, we can alter the payoffs of the off-diagonal results (A0, A1 and A1, A0) without affecting the outcomes where both players choose the same action (A0, A0 and A1, A1), as the transfers between players cancel out in those cases.

To make A0 the only rational choice, we need to make it a dominant strategy. Let $C(A0)$ and $C(A1)$ be the contract values. The payoff for Player 1 when playing A0 if Player 2 plays A1 is $0 + C(A0) - C(A1)$. For A0 to be a dominant strategy, this must be greater than the payoff for playing A1 if Player 2 plays A1, which is $3 + C(A1) - C(A1) = 3$. 
Thus: $0 + C(A0) - C(A1) > 3 \implies C(A0) - C(A1) > 3$.

If we set $C(A0) = 4$ and $C(A1) = 0$, the payoff matrix becomes:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this scenario, A0 is a dominant strategy for both players ($5 > -1$ and $4 > 3$). This ensures the outcome is (A0, A0), providing 5 points. Any contract values that satisfy $C(A0) - C(A1) > 3$ will achieve this coordination while remaining fair and likely to be approved.

response:
To tackle this problem, we need to design a contract that aligns the incentives of both players to maximize the total points received by both. Here’s how we should approach this:

1. **Understanding the Game Payoffs**:
   - If both players choose A0: Each gets 5 points.
   - If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: I get 0 points, they get 3 points.
   - If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: I get 3 points, they get 0 points.
   - If both choose A1: Each gets 3 points.

2. **Objectives**:
   - Maximize my total points.
   - Ensure that both players are incentivized to accept the same contract.

3. **Alignment of Incentives**:
   - Both players choosing A0 yields the highest combined payoff (10 points).
   - A contract should encourage both players to choose A0.

4. **Designing the Contract**:
   - We need to make A0 more attractive if both choose A0 compared to any other combination.
   - To achieve this, we will provide a positive additional payment for choosing A0, making A1 less attractive.

5. **Proposing the Contract**:
   - To further entice the other player to choose A0, we may consider adding a slight penalty for choosing A1.

By offering a positive incentive for A0 and potentially imposing a slight penalty on A1, we align both players to aim for A0. Given that symmetrical incentives tend to be the most straightforward for mutual agreement, we’ll apply them equally to both parties.

**Optimal Contract Proposal**:
```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": -1}
```
Explanation:
- Adding 1 point for choosing A0 increases the total combined payoff for both players to 12 points if both choose A0.
- A penalty of -1 point for choosing A1 discourages both players from diverging to A1 unless the expected payoff justifies it.

Contract rationale:
- If both players choose A0: Each gets 5 + 1 = 6 points (total 12).
- If one chooses A0 and the other A1: A0 chooser gets 0 + 1 = 1 point, A1 chooser gets 3 - 1 = 2 points (total 3).
- If both choose A1: Each gets 3 - 1 = 2 points (total 4).

This balances the game's incentives to reach an agreement where both players maximize their payoffs by choosing A0.

response:
To design a contract that maximizes the total points received, we need to consider the payoffs of the original game and how we can incentivize both players to adopt certain strategies that lead to the most beneficial outcomes.

The original payoff matrix is as follows:

|          | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| You A0   | (5, 5)           | (0, 3)           |
| You A1   | (3, 0)           | (3, 3)           |

From this, it's clear that the most beneficial mutual outcome is when both players choose A0, resulting in a (5, 5) payoff. However, without coordination, there's a risk that players might choose A1 to avoid the (0, 3) or (3, 0) outcomes. We will use the contract to align both players' incentives towards the mutually beneficial (5, 5) outcome.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the Best Outcome**: Both players choosing A0 gives the highest total payoff of 10 points (5 points each).

2. **Understand Potential Divergence**: Without a contract, players might fear the other choosing A1, leading them to also choose A1, resulting in a less efficient (3, 3) payoff.

3. **Design Incentives**: The contract should incentivize both players to choose A0. We aim to penalize for choosing A1 and/or reward for choosing A0 to ensure both players willingly choose A0.

4. **Balance the Payoffs**: Ensure the incentives/penalties are balanced such that the total points distributed in the game do not drastically deviate from the original game's total points possible across both actions.

### Constructing the Contract:

- To incentivize A0, we reward for choosing A0.
- To disincentivize A1, we penalize for choosing A1.

Let’s propose additional payoffs as follows:
- A0: +2 points (additional bonus for coordination)
- A1: -2 points (penalty for deviation)

This setup makes sure that the total points when both choose A0 are still singly distributed but with additional encouragement to stick to A0.

### JSON Representation:

The final contract can be represented as a JSON object as required:

```json
{"A0": 2, "A1": -2}
```

### Explanation:

- **A0**: This gives a reward of +2 points if a player chooses A0, further encouraging the high payoff (5, 5) outcome.
- **A1**: This imposes a penalty of -2 points if a player chooses A1, discouraging the deviation to the (3, 3) outcome.

By proposing this contract, you ensure that choosing A0 is more attractive for both players, facilitating the optimal payoff configuration.

### Final Answer:

```json
{"A0": 2, "A1": -2}
```

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game
The payoff matrix is:
```
                Player 2 (Me)
           A0        A1
P1  A0   (5,5)    (0,3)
    A1   (3,0)    (3,3)
```

This is a coordination game with:
- Two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) yielding (5,5) and (A1,A1) yielding (3,3)
- A mixed Nash equilibrium where both play A0 with probability 3/5, yielding expected payoff of 3 for each player

### Step 2: Identify the Problem
The issue is coordination risk. We both want (A0,A0) for the payoff of 5 each, but there's risk - if I play A0 while the other plays A1, I get 0. This risk pushes us toward the mixed strategy equilibrium where we only get 3 on average.

### Step 3: Design Contract Objective
I want a contract that:
1. Makes (A0,A0) the clear Nash equilibrium
2. Is mutually beneficial so both players approve it
3. Maximizes my payoff subject to being acceptable

### Step 4: Propose a Penalty for Defection
I'll penalize playing A1 to make A0 dominant for me:

Contract: **A0: 0, A1: -4**

This means:
- When I play A0: no additional payment
- When I play A1: I pay 4 points to the other player

### Step 5: Verify the New Equilibrium
With this contract, the payoffs become:
```
                Player 2 (Me)
           A0        A1
P1  A0   (5,5)    (4,-1)
    A1   (3,0)    (7,-1)
```

- For me: A0 gives {5,0} vs A1 gives {-1,-1} → A0 is strictly dominant
- For Player 1 (knowing I'll play A0): gets 5 from A0, 3 from A1 → prefers A0

**Result: (A0,A0) is the unique Nash equilibrium, yielding (5,5)**

### Step 6: Check Acceptance
- Both players get 5 (vs. 3 in the mixed equilibrium)
- The outcome is fair and symmetric
- Both players should approve this contract

{"A0": 0, "A1": -4}

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

The payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): 5, 5 ← Best mutual outcome
- (A0, A1): 0, 3 
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3 ← Safe mutual outcome

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) giving 5 points each
- (A1, A1) giving 3 points each

The problem: A1 is safer because it guarantees at least 3 points, while playing A0 risks getting 0 if the other player chooses A1.

## Step 2: Understand contract mechanics

With a symmetric contract {"A0": X, "A1": Y}:
- Positive values mean receiving payment from the other player
- Negative values mean paying the other player
- When both play the same action, transfers cancel out

## Step 3: Design objectives

I want a contract that:
1. Makes (A0, A0) the unique Nash equilibrium
2. Benefits both players (so they'll approve it)
3. Maximizes coordination on the 5-point outcome

## Step 4: Find the solution

If I make A0 rewarding enough, it becomes dominant. Let me try {"A0": 4, "A1": 0}:

New payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 5, 5 (transfers cancel)
- (A0, A1): 4, -1 (I receive 4 from other; base: 0, 3)
- (A1, A0): -1, 4 (other receives 4 from me; base: 3, 0)  
- (A1, A1): 3, 3 (no transfers)

Now checking dominance:
- If other plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1 → **A0 better**
- If other plays A1: I get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **A0 better**

**A0 is now strictly dominant!** Same for the other player by symmetry.

## Step 5: Verify approval worthiness

- With this contract: unique equilibrium at (A0, A0) with payoff 5 each
- Without contract: risk of (A1, A1) with payoff 3 each
- Both players benefit, so both should approve

{"A0": 4, "A1": 0}

Let's break this down step by step, carefully analyzing the game, the payoffs, and how contracts can be used strategically to maximize our expected points.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a symmetric game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2), each choosing between A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|          | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

---

### **Step 2: Identify Nash Equilibria (Base Game)**

Let’s find the pure-strategy Nash equilibria.

- (A0, A0): If P1 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no incentive. If P2 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no incentive. → **NE**
- (A1, A1): If P1 deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3 → no incentive. Same for P2. → **NE**
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, could switch to A1 → gets 3 > 0 → deviation profitable → not NE
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 0, could switch to A1 → gets 3 > 0 → deviation profitable → not NE

So pure NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Now consider mixed strategies.

Let P1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p)  
Let P2 play A0 with probability q, A1 with (1-q)

For P1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- Expected payoff A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q
- Expected payoff A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3
Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

For P2 to be indifferent:
- A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3
Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So one mixed-strategy NE: both play A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4

Thus, the game has multiple equilibria: two pure and one mixed.

But importantly, the **(A0, A0)** outcome gives both 5 points → best for **both** in terms of payoffs.

But (A1, A1) gives only 3 each → worse.

So (A0, A0) is Pareto superior.

But in equilibrium, rational players may not coordinate on (A0, A0) unless they can commit or trust each other.

---

### **Step 3: Introduce the Contract Mechanism**

Now we can **propose a contract** that adds extra payoffs:

- For each action (A0 or A1), we define a number:
  - Positive: we get money from the other player (we are paid)
  - Negative: we pay money to the other player
  - Zero: no transfer

We can **propose** a contract. The **other player also proposes** one. Then both of us vote on the contracts (approval voting). The one with **most approvals** wins. In case of a tie, **randomly selected from the tied contracts**.

We are to **maximize our total points** — this includes:
- Base game payoff
- Contract payoff (if we accept the contract)

But note: **the contract only takes effect if both accept it.**

So we can only benefit from the contract **if we accept it AND the other player accepts it.**

We want to **design a contract that incentivizes the other player to accept it**, especially one that **leads to the outcome we prefer**, ideally (A0, A0), where we get 5.

But our own action choice is still probabilistic (we choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1). But we can influence the other player’s behavior via the contract.

---

### **Step 4: Strategy for Contracts**

We need to **design a contract that makes it in the other player’s interest to play A0**, so that we can reach (A0, A0) — which gives us 5 points.

But the contract is applied **unilaterally**: we specify the extra payoff for **our own actions**, and the other player specifies theirs.

But remember: **the contract is only active if both players accept it.**

So we can design a contract that gives **us incentives** (positive amounts) in certain actions, and/or **penalizes or rewards** the other player (via payments).

But here’s the catch: the **contract defines payments based on the action the player takes** — so when *I* play A0, I get +X (if contract says A0: +X), and similarly for A1.

Important: the **contract specifies payments from the "player's perspective"**.

Let’s clarify:

> "A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
> - Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
> - Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s)."

So, for **me**, if I play A0 and my contract says A0: +5, I get +5 from the contract (paid by the other player).

So the total payoff = base payoff + contract payoff.

The key is: the **other player designs their own contract** — so they will also want to influence the game outcome in their favor.

We want to design a contract such that:

1. It **is appealing enough to the other player** that they want to **accept it**.
2. Once accepted, it **leads to the outcome (A0, A0)** — or at least increases the probability of it — so we get high base payoff.
3. Even if they design their own contract, we need our contract to **win in the approval voting process**.

But we only get to **propose one contract**. The other player proposes another. Then both of us vote on both.

So we can **strategically propose a contract that we think will get both of us to accept** — and that leads to our preferred outcome.

---

### **Step 5: Target Outcome: (A0, A0)**

We want (A0, A0) because:
- We get 5 points (best possible)
- The other player also gets 5 points

So if we can coordinate on (A0, A0), we both get the best payoff.

But without cooperation, the other player might play A1 (if they think we are going to play A0), because playing A1 gets them 0 in (A0,A1), which is worse than 5 — so actually, in (A0,A1) they get 3, which is less than 5. Wait, no:

Check (A0, A1): we (P1) get 0, other player gets 3.

So if other player plays A1 when we play A0, they get 3 — less than 5, so they are worse off.

So **the other player has no incentive to play A1 when we play A0**, because they get only 3 instead of 5.

But if *they* play A0, and we play A1, then they get 0 — worse than 3.

So actually:
- If I play A0, they prefer A0 (get 5 vs 3)
- If I play A1, they prefer A1 (get 3 vs 0)

But if I play A1 and they play A0 → they get 0 → bad. So they'd rather play A1 to get 3.

So the problem is: **if I play A1, they play A1** (to avoid 0).

But if I play A0, they play A0 (to avoid 3).

But I want to **incentivize them to play A0**, because that leads to (A0, A0), which gives me 5.

But the issue is: **I don’t control their behavior** — they will choose their action to maximize their payoff, given my action.

So the only way to get (A0, A0) is if we both want to play A0.

But if I play A0, they will play A0 — so (A0,A0) is stable **if I play A0**.

But if I play A1, they play A1 → (A1,A1) → I get 3.

So if I play A0, I get 5. If I play A1, I get 3. So **I should play A0** — unless there’s a reason not to.

But if I play A0, I get 5 — best.

But **can I be sure the other player will play A0?**

Only if they are convinced it’s optimal.

But as above: if I play A0, their best response is A0 (5 > 3).

So if I play A0, they play A0 → I get 5.

But the problem is: **I don’t know what they will do**.

But in equilibrium, we can expect them to play A0 **if** I play A0.

But if I am uncertain, I might randomize.

But actually, **Pareto efficiency is achieved at (A0,A0)**, and both players have incentive to coordinate on it if they can.

But contracts can help us **enforce** that.

So let’s use the contract to **ensure that both players want to play A0**.

---

### **Step 6: Design a Contract That Makes A0 Dominant**

I want to create a contract such that **no matter what the other player does**, I am better off playing A0.

But I can't force them to play A0, but I can **reward** myself for playing A0 and **penalize me for playing A1**, if it helps.

But the contract affects **my own payoff**.

So I can say: "If I play A0, I get +5 extra; if I play A1, I pay -3".

But the other player sees that.

Alternatively, to **incentivize them** to play A0, I can **reward them** if they play A0.

But **only if I set up the contract to pay them when they play A0**.

But I'm proposing **my own** contract.

So I can say:

| Action | My contract payoff |
|--------|------------------|
| A0     | +2               |
| A1     | 0                |

Then, if I play A0, I get +2 extra — so my total payoff increases.

But this doesn't affect the other player directly — it’s **only my** extra. They don't get anything.

But they are **not** going to care about my extra payoff unless it makes them better off.

Unless **the contract is structured to benefit them**.

But wait: **the contract is an agreement: if I play A0, I pay them or they pay me?**

From the description:

> "Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s)."

So if I set A0: +2 in my contract, that means **I receive +2**, **from the other player**.

So if I play A0, the other player pays me 2.

Similarly, if I set A0: -2, I pay the other player 2.

Ah! So **the contract has a transfer effect**.

So if I write A0: +2, A1: 0, then:

- If I play A0: I get +2 **from the other player**
- If I play A1: no extra transfer

So this increases my payoff if I play A0.

But what does that do to the **other player**'s incentives?

Let’s suppose the **other player plays A0**, and I play A0 → I get +2 from them, so I am **indifferent or better**.

But their own payoff: they get 5 (base) + they pay me 2 → total 3.

Wait: if I play A0, I get +2 from them → so **they lose 2**.

Similarly, if I play A0 and they play A1, they get 3 (base) + they pay me 2 → total 1.

So they **get less** when I play A0.

But they might want to **avoid** me playing A0?

No — they have their own strategy.

This is getting complex.

Let’s reframe.

The contract is **my** proposal. It defines:
- How much **I** receive or pay based on the **action I take**.
- And transfers happen **between us**.

So my contract affects:
- My total payoff (base + contract)
- The other player's payoff (opposite of my gain/loss)

But the **other player** will also design a contract — so they may try to **penalize** me for playing certain actions.

But the **winning contract** is the one that **gets most approvals** — and we both vote.

So to make our contract **get approved**, we need **both players** to want to accept it.

So the contract must be **mutually beneficial** — or at least **not harmful** to each player.

But we are trying to **maximize our own total points**, so we should design a contract that:
1. Is acceptable to the other player (so they accept it)
2. Leads to high probability of (A0, A0)
3. Maximizes our expected payoff (base + contract)

---

### **Step 7: Key Insight — Design a Contract That Makes A0 Dominant for Both**

Let’s try to design a contract where:
- If I play A0, I get +2 from them
- If I play A1, I pay them 0

So my contract: {"A0": 2, "A1": 0}

Then:
- If I play A0 → I get +2 from them → they lose 2
- If I play A1 → no change

So my total payoff is increased if I play A0.

But the other player hates it when I play A0 — they lose 2.

But they only lose it if I play A0 — so they might want to **avoid** me playing A0 by playing A1 themselves — to make me play A1?

But if they play A1, and I play A0 → I get 0 base + 2 = 2, they get 3 base - 2 = 1

If they play A0 and I play A0 → I get 5 + 2 = 7, they get 5 - 2 = 3

If I play A1:
- I get 3 + 0 = 3
- They get 0 or 3 (depending on their choice)

But if they play A0 and I play A1: they get 0 base - 0 = 0

If they play A1 and I play A1: they get 3 - 0 = 3

So if they play A0, and I play A1, they get 0
If they play A1, and I play A1, they get 3

So they are better off playing A1 when I play A1.

But they don’t know what I will do.

So if I play A0, they get 3 (if they play A0) or 1 (if they play A1)

So they prefer to play A0.

If I play A1, they get 0 (if they play A0) or 3 (if they play A1) → so they prefer to play A1.

But I am incentivized to play A0 (gives me 5 + 2 = 7 vs 3 + 0 = 3)

So if I play A0, they prefer to play A0 → so (A0, A0) happens → I get 7 total.

But if I play A1, they play A1 → I get 3 → worse.

So I will play A0 → they play A0 → I get 7.

But the **other player gets 3** (5 - 2), which is worse than if they just played A0 in the base game (get 5).

So they are worse off — they might **not want to accept this contract**.

Indeed, if they accept it, and they play A0, they get only 3.

But if they reject it, and we play base game, they could get 5 in (A0,A0), or 3 in (A1,A1), etc.

So they are worse off under this contract **unless they play A0 and I play A0**.

But even then, they get only 3.

So they may **reject the contract** — which means I don’t get the extra 2.

So this contract may **not be accepted**.

But I want it accepted.

So I must **make it beneficial for the other player as well**.

### **Step 8: Design a Symmetric Contract That Rewards Coordination**

Idea: make a contract where **both players are rewarded when they both play A0**.

But only one contract can be chosen.

So instead, I can propose a contract that **gives each player a bonus when they play A0**, but only if both agree.

But contracts are **unilateral** — I set my contract.

But the contract can include transfers.

Suppose I propose:

{"A0": 2, "A1": -2}

Then:
- If I play A0: I get +2 from them
- If I play A1: I pay them 2

So if I play A0, I gain 2; if I play A1, I lose 2.

So I **strongly prefer to play A0**.

But the other player gets:
- If I play A0 → they lose 2
- If I play A1 → they gain 2

So they **hate it when I play A0**.

So they will want to **avoid** me playing A0 — by playing A0 to make me play A1? No — if they play A0, and I play A1 → I pay them 2 → they gain 2.

But I am playing A1 — so I get 3 base - 2 = 1, they get 0 + 2 = 2.

If they play A1 and I play A1: I get 3 - 2 = 1, they get 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait: when I play A1, I pay them 2 → so they gain 2.

So if I play A1, they get: base payoff + 2.

So if they play A1, they get 3 + 2 = 5  
If they play A0, they get 0 + 2 = 2

So they prefer to play A1 if I play A1.

But I prefer to play A0 (5 + 2 = 7 vs 3 - 2 = 1)

So I will play A0 — they will play A0 (since if they play A0, they get 5 - 2 = 3; if they play A1, they get 3 - 2 = 1) → so they prefer A0.

So (A0, A0): I get 5 + 2 = 7, they get 5 - 2 = 3

But they get 3, which is worse than 5.

So they dislike this.

To make them accept the contract, I must **give them a benefit**.

---

### **Step 9: Best Idea: A Contract That Gives Them a Benefit When They Play A0**

Suppose I propose a contract that says:
- If I play A0: I get +0 (no gain)
- If I play A1: I pay them -0 (no cost)

No incentive. But not helpful.

Suppose:
- I set A0: 0
- I set A1: 0

Then no contract effect — just base game.

Not useful.

Suppose:
- I set A0: 0
- I set A1: -5

Then if I play A1, I pay them 5.

But I would never play A1 — 3 - 5 = -2 < 5

So I play A0 → I get 5

But they get 5 + 0 = 5 (if I play A0)

So they get same as base.

But no extra benefit.

But if they play A0, I play A0 → they get 5 — same as base.

But if I play A1, I pay them 5 — they get 3 + 5 = 8 — better.

But I won't play A1.

So outcome is (A0,A0) — they get 5.

But they get same as base — so they might accept.

But is it better for them?

In base game, they can get 5 in (A0,A0), or 3 in others.

So they get 5 — same.

But I get 5 — same.

So no change — but they gain nothing.

So they might still accept — but not compelled.

But I want **them to prefer to accept**.

---

### **Step 10: Breakthrough: Propose a Contract That Makes A0 the Best for Them**

Let me propose:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0}

Then no change. But if they accept, we just play the base game.

They might accept if they think (A0,A0) is likely.

But not guaranteed.

Can I make it better for them?

Suppose I propose:

{"A0": 1, "A1": 1}

Then if I play A0 or A1, I get +1 from them.

So whenever I play anything, they pay me 1.

Then:
- If I play A0: I get 5 + 1 = 6, they get 5 - 1 = 4
- If I play A1: I get 3 + 1 = 4, they get 3 - 1 = 2

So they get less in both cases.

So they will hate this — they get 4 or 2, instead of 5 or 3.

So they will not accept.

---

### **Step 11: Final Strategy — Make Both Players Cooperate by Rewarding A0**

Idea: **Make it so that if they play A0, they get a bonus, but I absorb the cost.**

But I am designing my contract.

Suppose I propose:

{"A0": -1, "A1": 0}

Then:
- If I play A0, I pay them 1
- If I play A1, I pay them 0

So I am worse off when I play A0.

But I want them to play A0.

But if they play A0, and I play A0, I get 5 - 1 = 4, they get 5 + 1 = 6

If they play A0, and I play A1, I get 3 - 0 = 3, they get 0 + 1 = 1

If they play A1, and I play A1, I get 3 - 0 = 3, they get 3 + 0 = 3

So if they play A0, they get 6 or 1 — so they prefer to play A0 only if they think I play A0.

But if I play A0, I get 4; if I play A1, I get 3 — so I prefer A0.

So (A0,A0) happens: I get 4, they get 6.

They get 6 > 5 — better than base game.
I get 4 < 5 — worse than base game.

So they love this contract — it gives them 6 in (A0,A0), which is better than 5.

I get 4 < 5 — worse.

But I might still want to accept if it leads to (A0,A0), which is better than mixed.

But in base game, I could get 5 in (A0,A0) — here I get 4.

So I am worse off.

But the contract is for **both to accept** — and I want to maximize my total.

But if I propose this, they may accept (because they gain), but I lose.

Not good.

But what if I do the opposite?

What if I propose:

{"A0": 4, "A1": 0}

Then:
- If I play A0, I get +4 from them, so I get 5 + 4 = 9
- If I play A0, they get 5 - 4 = 1
- If I play A1, I get 3 + 0 = 3, they get 3

So if (A0,A0): I get 9, they get 1
If I play A1: I get 3, they get 3

So I prefer A0 — get 9
They prefer to play A1 if I play A1 (get 3) or A0 (get 1) — they want to play A1 if I play A1, A0 if I play A0? But if I play A0, they get 1; if they play A1, they get 3 — so they prefer A1.

But if they play A1 and I play A0: they get 3 (base) - 4 = -1

If they play A0 and I play A0: they get 1

So better to play A0.

They get 1 vs -1 — so they prefer A0.

So (A0,A0) happens: I get 9, they get 1

They get only 1, which is worse than 5.

So they will not accept — because they are getting less than base.

So they will reject.

---

### **Step 12: Optimal Contract — No Cost, But Creates Incentive for Coordination**

Final idea: **Propose a contract that makes A0 dominant for me, but gives the other player a benefit only when we cooperate.**

But I can't force anything.

Best compromise: **Propose a contract that gives the other player a bonus if they play A0, and I pay for it by paying them when I play A0? No, that hurts me.**

Wait: no.

Let’s think differently.

Suppose I propose:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0}

Then no contract effect.

But the other player can propose and get the benefit.

But I want my contract to win.

So I need to make my contract **appealing**.

Suppose I propose:

{"A0": 1, "A1": 0}

Then I get +1 if I play A0, 0 if A1.

So I am more likely to play A0.

But the other player pays me 1 if I play A0.

So if we are in (A0,A0): I get 5 + 1 = 6, they get 5 - 1 = 4

If they play A1 and I play A0: I get 0 + 1 = 1, they get 3 - 1 = 2

They get 4 or 2, which is less than 5, so they are worse off.

So they will not accept.

Unless... I make it so that they get a bonus when they play A0.

But I can't directly give them a bonus unless I pay them when I play A0 — but that's the opposite.

Wait — no.

The contract is defined by the player.

When I play A0, I pay or receive based on my contract.

If I want them to get +1 when they play A0, I can't do that in my contract — unless I set a penalty for them, which I can't.

The only way to make them better off is if my contract makes them receive money, but that means they get money when **I play an action**.

So only way is if I receive negative amounts (pay them) when I play something.

But then I am worse off.

So the only way to make the other player better off is to **not take any money from them**.

But then they get the same or less.

 unless the contract enables (A0,A0) to happen with higher probability.

But in base game, (A0,A0) can happen in equilibrium.

The problem is the other player might not trust.

So the best idea is to **offer a contract that benefits me and does not hurt the other player, and is credible**.

After careful thought, here is a brilliant idea:

### **Propose a contract that has no cost to them, and makes me play A0 for sure, and gives them 5 in (A0,A0), unchanged.**

So set my contract to: {"A0": 0, "A1": 0}

Then no transfer.

And if I play A0, I get 5.

They get 5.

So no harm, no gain.

But they might accept, hoping we both play A0.

But if we both play A0, we both get 5.

But in the contract, no change.

But they have no incentive to accept — but no reason to reject.

So acceptance is possible.

But I can do better.

What if I make it so that if they play A0, and I play A0, both get extra, but paid by me?

But I can't.

Final insight: since both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff, and (A0,A0) is Pareto efficient, and both have incentive to play A0 if the other does, the best contract is to **not have any contract** — because it's already good.

But we have to propose one.

And we want it to be accepted and lead to (A0,A0).

The key is: **make the contract such that the other player gets at least as much as in the base game, and I get as much as possible.**

Suppose I propose: {"A0": -1, "A1":0}

Then if I play A0, I pay them 1.

So in (A0,A0), I get 5 - 1 = 4, they get 5 + 1 = 6

They get 6 > 5 — better.

I get 4 < 5 — worse.

So they will accept because they gain.

I get less.

But if I don't propose this, and we play base game, I might get 5, or 3, or less.

But if I play A0, they play A0, I get 5.

But if I propose this contract, and they accept, then in (A0,A0) I get 4.

So I am worse off.

So not good.

Unless the contract allows us to coordinate on (A0,A0) more reliably.

But in base game, we can coordinate.

 perhaps the best is to set no transfer.

After analysis, the only contract that can be mutually acceptable and doesn't harm them is one that doesn't change payoffs.

So set:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0}

Then if they accept, we play the base game.

And they won't lose anything.

And I might get 5.

So it's safe.

But can I do better?

Final solution:

### **Propose: {"A0": 2, "A1": 2}**
Then I get +2 for any action.

So I play A0 for sure (5+2=7 vs 3+2=5).

They get 3 or 5 minus 2 = 1 or 3.

So if I play A0, they get 1 if they play A1, 3 if they play A0.

So they prefer A0 (3 > 1)

So (A0,A0) -> I get 7, they get 3.

They get 3, which is less than 5.

So they will not accept.

Unless I make it so that they get a bonus.

 impossible.

 after all, the only way to make them accept is to give them a benefit.

 best contract: make it so that they get a bonus when they play A0, but I pay the cost.

But I can't.

Therefore, the only contract that is not harmful to them and might be accepted is one where I give them if they do something.

 but I can't.

 wait.

 what if I offer: {"A0": -5, "A1": 0}

Then if I play A0, I pay them 5.

In (A0,A0): I get 5-5=0, they get 5+5=10

They love it.

I get 0.

 not good.

 no.

 after careful thought, the only viable contract is to have no transfer.

But let's read the game again.

Perhaps the contract can be used to make A0 the only rational choice.

But for me, if I set A0: 0, A1: -4, then if I play A1, I pay them 4.

So I get 3 - 4 = -1, but if I play A0, I get 5.

So I play A0.

The other player, if they play A0, and I play A0, they get 5 - 0 = 5.

If they play A1, they get 3 - 0 = 3.

So they prefer A0.

So (A0,A0) happens.

I get 5.

They get 5.

No transfer, because my contract has A0: 0, so no payment.

So if I set {"A0": 0, "A1": -100}

Then I am forced to play A0, because A1 gives me 3 - 100 = -97.

They get 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1.

So they play A0.

So (A0,A0) happens.

I get 5, they get 5.

The contract has no transfer in this case.

But if I set A1: -100, then when I play A1, I pay them 100.

But I never play A1, so no payment.

So it's as if no transfer.

And the other player gets same as base.

So they have no reason to reject.

And I get 5.

And this contract is safe.

But can I get more?

If I set A0: 1, A1: -100, then if I play A0, I get 5+1=6, they get 5-1=4.

They get 4 < 5, so they may reject.

So not good.

Therefore, the best is to set A0: 0, A1: any number, say -1, so that I am forced to play A0.

But to minimize the risk of rejection, better to set A1: 0.

Then my contract is {"A0": 0, "A1": 0}

It's harmless.

And it may be accepted.

And we play (A0,A0) with high probability.

But to ensure, I can set a very high penalty for A1.

But the risk is that they might not accept if they think it's a trick.

Given all, the safest and optimal contract is one that does not harm the other player and ensures that I play A0.

So let's to make it obvious.

Final decision:

**Propose: {"A0": 0, "A1": -1}**

- If I play A1, I pay them 1
- If I play A0, no transfer

Then:
- I will play A0 (5 > 3-1=2)
- If they play A0, I play A0, they get 5
- If they play A1, and I play A0, they get 3 - 0 = 3
- So they prefer A0 (5 > 3)

So (A0,A0) happens.

I get 5, they get 5.

No transfer, so they are not hurt.

And I ensure coordination.

And the contract has a -1 for A1, which is a small penalty.

So it's credible.

And they are not worse off.

So likely to accept.

And I get 5.

If I do nothing, in mixed strategy, I might get less.

So this is good.

But can I do better?

Suppose I set A0: 1, A1: -10

Then if I play A0, I get +1 from them, so 6
They get 4
They are worse off.

So not good.

So best is to avoid giving them less.

Therefore, the best contract is to have no positive or negative effect, but ensure my action is A0.

So only set A1: -1, A0: 0.

Then I and they both get 5.

And I ensure coordination in (A0,A0).

So this is optimal.

Final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": -1}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to design a contract that maximizes *your* total expected points, given that:

- You are Player 2.
- You and the other player (Player 1) simultaneously choose a probability over actions A0 and A1.
- After that, a random draw determines the actual actions based on those probabilities.
- Points are awarded based on the payoff matrix.
- Then, a contract is proposed by both players (you and the other player), and only the one with the most approvals will be implemented (with a tie broken uniformly at random).
- You can propose a contract: a pair of values (for A0 and A1) that represent additional payments you get (or pay) **if you play that action**.
- The contract only takes effect if **both players accept** it.
- Your goal: **maximize your expected total points** (original payoff + contract payoff), *conditioned on the contract being accepted*.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the base game (no contract)

Let’s first understand the base game without contracts.

Payoff for Player 2 (you):

| Your Choice \ Other's Choice | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| A0                            | 5        | 0        |
| A1                            | 3        | 3        |

Let’s denote:
- You play A0 with probability $ p $
- The other player plays A0 with probability $ q $

Then your expected payoff:
$$
E_2 = p \cdot [q \cdot 5 + (1 - q) \cdot 0] + (1 - p) \cdot [q \cdot 3 + (1 - q) \cdot 3]
= p(5q) + (1 - p)(3)
= 5pq + 3 - 3p
$$

We can analyze best responses later.

But notice:
- If the other player plays A0, you prefer A0 (5 > 3).
- If the other player plays A1, you are indifferent (0 vs 3) — A1 is better.
- So your best response is:
  - A0 if $ q > 0.6 $
  - A1 if $ q < 0.6 $
  - Indifferent if $ q = 0.6 $

Similarly, for Player 1:
| Their choice \ Your choice | A0 | A1 |
|----------------------------|----|----|
| A0                         | 5  | 3  |
| A1                         | 0  | 3  |

Their payoff:
- If you play A0: best to play A0 (5 > 0)
- If you play A1: indifferent (3 = 3)
- So best response: play A0 if $ p > 0 $, and indifferent otherwise.

This suggests a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

Let’s find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MNE):

- Let $ p $ = your (Player 2) probability of A0
- Let $ q $ = other player's (Player 1) probability of A0

For Player 1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- Their expected payoff from A0: $ 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p $
- From A1: $ 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 $
- Set equal: $ 5p = 3 \Rightarrow p = 0.6 $

For Player 2 to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- Your payoff from A0: $ 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q $
- From A1: $ 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 $
- Set equal: $ 5q = 3 \Rightarrow q = 0.6 $

So **(q = 0.6, p = 0.6)** is the unique mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

At this equilibrium:
- Expected payoff for you: plug in $ p = 0.6 $, $ q = 0.6 $
  $$
  E_2 = 5(0.6)(0.6) + 3 - 3(0.6) = 1.8 + 3 - 1.8 = 3
  $$
  So both players get 3 points on average.

But is this the best we can do? Can we do better by using a contract?

---

### Step 2: Understanding the contract

The contract specifies for each action an **extra payoff** you get (or pay) **if you play that action**.

So if you propose:
```json
{"A0": 2, "A1": -1}
```
Then:
- If you play A0, you receive +2 (from the contract), and the other player pays you 2 total (so they lose 2).
- If you play A1, you lose 1 (pay 1), and the other player gains 1.

The contract is **only active if both players accept**.

You and the other player each propose a contract. Then, for each contract, count how many players approve it. The one with the **maximum approvals** wins. If there's a tie, it's chosen uniformly at random.

You want to:
- Propose a contract that you expect to be accepted (and ideally, that gives you higher expected total payoff).
- Also, make it likely that **your contract gets accepted** — so it should be appealing to the other player.

So we need to design a contract such that:
1. It is **incentive-compatible**: both players have reason to accept it — i.e., it makes *each* player **better off** than the status quo (i.e., the Nash equilibrium with no contract).
2. It should **induce behavior** that is favorable to you.

But here’s the key: you **want** to be able to **coordinate on mutual cooperation** — particularly on (A0, A0), which gives both 5 points. That’s better than the 3 you get in equilibrium.

But currently, if one plays A0 and the other A1, you get 0, which is bad.

So you want to **incentivize both to play A0**.

But the other player has **no incentive to play A0** unless you play A0 — but you might not want to play A0 unless they do.

Hence, we need a contract that **makes it optimal for both to play A0**.

But you can't force anything — you can only propose terms.

So idea: **Design a contract that rewards A0 and penalizes A1**, but in a way that the other player finds it acceptable.

Let’s suppose you propose a contract where:
- If you play A0, you get +x
- If you play A1, you get -y

But **you cannot dictate the payoffs for the other player**. Only *your* payoffs are specified.

So, the contract is unilateral: you specify your own extra payoffs per action.

However, **the other player sees this too** and decides whether to accept it. If they accept, the contract is added to the game.

So, let’s suppose you propose a contract where:
- A0: +a (you gain a if you play A0)
- A1: -b (you lose b if you play A1)

This makes A0 more attractive to *you*. But the other player might **not** accept it unless it benefits them.

So for the other player to accept, they must **gain utility (or at least not lose)** from accepting the contract.

But in this setup, **the contract only specifies your extra payoffs**, not theirs.

Wait: **How does the contract affect the other player?**

The description says:
> "a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases: Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s)."

Ah! Important: **“drawn equally from the other player(s)”**

So if you receive +X when you play A0, that money **comes from the other player(s)** — so the other player loses X.

Similarly, if you pay -X (i.e., you receive -X), then that amount goes to the other player(s).

So the **contract is budget-neutral overall**.

For example:
- If you get +5 for playing A0, the other player pays 5 total.
- If you get -3 for playing A1, the other player gains 3.

So the **net transfer between you and the other player** is exactly what you specify — it's **not** that you gain X and the other gains nothing; rather, **one pays the other**.

Thus, the contract modifies the payoff matrix by transferring money **from the other player to you** based on how you play.

So if you play A0 and the contract says +a, then:
- You gain a
- The other player loses a

Similarly, if you play A1 and the contract says -b:
- You lose b (so net gain = -b)
- The other player gains b

So **you can only get money from the other player by playing actions you are incentivized to take**.

Now, you want to **design a contract** such that:
1. When both players accept it, the **equilibrium outcomes** become favorable to you (especially (A0, A0)).
2. The contract is **acceptable to the other player** — so that they have incentive to accept.

---

### Step 3: Designing a contract that induces (A0, A0)

Suppose you want to **make A0 a dominant strategy for you**, and you want the other player to also want to play A0.

But: the other player might not like playing A0 unless they get something.

Let’s suppose you propose a contract where:
- A0: +3 (you get +3 if you play A0, so other player loses 3)
- A1: 0 (you get nothing if you play A1, so no transfer)

Then your payoff structure becomes:
| Your choice / They choose | A0 | A1 |
|-----------------------------|----|----|
| A0                          | 5+3=8 | 0+3=3 |
| A1                          | 3+0=3 | 3+0=3 |

So for you: playing A0 is **always better or equal**, because:
- Against A0: 8 > 3
- Against A1: 3 = 3

So A0 dominates A1 for you.

Now, what about the other player?

Their original payoff: if you play A0, they get 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1 → so they prefer A0.

But now, you have a contract that **takes 3 points from them if you play A0**.

So when *you* play A0, they **lose 3** via contract.

So their total payoff:
- If you play A0:
  - They play A0: 5 (base) - 3 (contract loss) = 2
  - They play A1: 3 (base) - 3 (contract loss) = 0

So they still prefer A0, because 2 > 0.

If you play A1:
- You get 0 from contract (no loss), so no transfer.
- So they get:
  - A0: 5 (base) + 0 = 5
  - A1: 3 (base) + 0 = 3
  So still prefer A0.

So for the other player, **A0 is still best response in every case** (if you play A0, they prefer A0; if you play A1, they still prefer A0).

So for them, A0 is always best.

Now, you want **both to play A0** — but currently, you are **incentivized to play A0**, and they are **incentivized to play A0**.

So in equilibrium, both will play A0.

Then your total payoff:
- Base: 5
- Contract: +3 (since you played A0)
- Total: **8**

The other player:
- Base: 5
- Contract: -3 (loss)
- Total: **2**

So you gain **8**, they get **2**.

Now, would they **accept** this contract?

Well, if they **don’t accept**, then the game proceeds without contract — and in equilibrium, they get 3 (as we computed earlier).

But here, in the contract version, they get 2, which is **less** than 3.

So they **would not accept** this contract — it's worse for them.

So **you cannot propose a contract that harms the other player** and expect them to accept.

So you need a contract that makes **them better off** than without the contract.

But you want to get more than 3.

So, we need a contract that:
- Gives **you more than 3** expected payoff
- Gives **the other player more than 3** expected payoff
- So they have incentive to approve it
- And you are still better off

But wait: you can only **transfer money from them to you** based on your actions.

So your gains come at their expense.

Therefore, the **only way for both to be better off is if the contract causes a shift in behavior that increases total system payoff** (i.e., moves players to A0 A0), and the **contract redistributes the gains**.

But in this game, A0-A0 gives 5+5=10 total; while in the equilibrium, both get 3, so total 6.

So if we can induce A0-A0, we can create **4 extra points of total surplus**.

So if we can **split that surplus somehow** so that **both get more than 3**, and you get more than 3, that’s good.

But currently, if you just induce A0-A0 without contract, you get 5, they get 5 — both better than 3.

But the problem is: **without a contract, neither has incentive to play A0 if the other plays A1**.

For example, if you play A0, they prefer to play A0 (5 > 3), but if they play A1, you get 0.

But they don't know what you'll do.

So mutual cooperation is not stable.

But with a **contract that coordinates** the outcome, you can make **A0 A0 the equilibrium**.

But the contract can only affect payoffs, not directly make them play certain actions.

So idea:
- Propose a contract that makes **A0 A0 the unique equilibrium**.
- But make sure that **both players gain more than in the no-contract equilibrium (3 each)**.

So suppose you propose a contract where:
- If you play A0: you get +x
- If you play A1: you get -y

But since you are the one proposing, the other player decides whether to accept.

Let’s suppose you want to **coordinate on A0 A0**, so both play A0.

Then:
- Your total payoff: 5 + x (since you played A0)
- Their total payoff: 5 - x (since you get x, they lose x)

But only if they accept. If they don’t, both get 3.

So for them to accept, we need: $ 5 - x > 3 $ → $ x < 2 $

For you to benefit: $ 5 + x > 3 $ → $ x > -2 $ — easy.

So if $ x < 2 $, they prefer the contract.

But wait — this is only if the outcome is A0 A0.

But **could they end up playing something else**?

We need to make sure that **A0 A0 is the equilibrium under the contract**.

So let’s build this.

Suppose you propose:
- A0: +1
- A1: 0

Then:
- If you play A0: you get +1, so other player loses 1
- If you play A1: no transfer

Now, your payoff matrix (including contract):

| Your choice / Their choice | A0 | A1 |
|-----------------------------|----|----|
| A0                          | 5+1=6 | 0+1=1 |
| A1                          | 3+0=3 | 3+0=3 |

So your best response:
- If they play A0: you prefer A0 (6 > 3)
- If they play A1: indifferent (1 vs 3) → A1 is better

So you prefer A0 if they play A0, but A1 if they play A1.

Now, the other player:
- If you play A0: they get 5 - 1 = 4 (base 5, contract loss 1)
- If you play A1: they get 3 - 0 = 3

So if they play A0: get 4 (if you play A0) or 3 (if you play A1)
If they play A1: get 3 (if you play A0) or 3 (if you play A1)

So their payoff matrix:

| Their choice / Your choice | A0 | A1 |
|-----------------------------|----|----|
| A0                          | 4  | 3  |
| A1                          | 3  | 3  |

So if you play A0: they prefer A0 (4 > 3)
If you play A1: indifferent (3 = 3)

So their best response:
- A0 if you play A0
- A1 if you play A1

Now, can we have a mutual best response?

- If you play A0 → they best respond with A0 → then you: 6 > 3 → still want to play A0
- If you play A1 → they best respond with A1 → you are indifferent (3 vs 3), so you might play A1.

So **(A0, A0)** is a Nash equilibrium.

But **(A1, A1)** is also a Nash equilibrium: both play A1, get 3.

Is (A1, A1) stable?

- If you play A1, they are indifferent between A0 and A1 → so playing A1 is ok.
- If they play A1, you are indifferent → so you might play A1.

So **both A0-A0 and A1-A1 are equilibria**.

But in A1-A1:
- You get 3 (base) + 0 (contract) = 3
- They get 3 - 0 = 3

Which is **same as the original equilibrium**.

So they **could end up in the bad equilibrium**.

But you want to **coordinate on A0 A0**.

But without coordination, both equilibria are possible.

So the contract doesn’t help much unless we **eliminate** the (A1, A1) equilibrium.

How?

Suppose we make playing A0 more attractive to you **and** make playing A1 worse for you.

But if you make A1 worse (e.g., by adding penalty), you might make them more willing.

Try: **increase the penalty for A1**.

Suppose you propose:
- A0: +1
- A1: -2  (you pay 2 if you play A1)

Now, your payoff matrix:

| Your choice / Their choice | A0 | A1 |
|-----------------------------|----|----|
| A0                          | 5+1=6 | 0+1=1 |
| A1                          | 3-2=1 | 3-2=1 |

So **every time you play**, you get:
- If they play A0: 6 if you play A0, 1 if A1 → prefer A0
- If they play A1: 1 vs 1 → indifferent

So your best response: play A0 if they play A0; indifferent otherwise.

Now, their payoff:
- If you play A0: they lose 1 → get 5-1=4 (if they play A0), 3-1=2 (if A1)
- If you play A1: you lose 2 → they gain 2 → get 5+2=7 (if play A0), 3+2=5 (if play A1)

So their payoff matrix:

| Their choice / Your choice | A0 | A1 |
|-----------------------------|----|----|
| A0                          | 4  | 7  |
| A1                          | 2  | 5  |

So:
- If you play A0: they prefer A0 (4 > 2)
- If you play A1: they prefer A0 (7 > 5)

So **A0 is dominant strategy** for them.

Now, for you:
- If they play A0: you prefer A0 (6 > 1)
- If they play A1: indifferent (1 vs 1)

So **A0 is best response if they play A0**, and you are indifferent otherwise.

Now, can we have equilibrium?

- Suppose they play A0 → you best respond with A0 → then they get 4 (if you play A0), and prefer A0 → so (A0, A0) is equilibrium.

- Suppose they play A1 → you are indifferent → could play A1.

  But if you play A1, they get 7 if they play A0 → so they prefer to play A0.

  So if they play A1, they get 5 if you play A1, but would prefer to play A0 and get 7 → so they would deviate.

  So (A1, A1) is **not** equilibrium.

  Similarly, (A1, A0): you play A1, they play A0 → you get 1, but you could switch to A0 and get 6 → so you deviate.

So **only equilibrium is (A0, A0)**.

Perfect!

Now, in this equilibrium:
- You play A0 → you get 5 (base) + 1 (contract) = 6
- They play A0 → they get 5 (base) - 1 (contract) = 4

Compare to no contract: both get 3.

So:
- You get 6 > 3 → better
- They get 4 > 3 → better

So **both players are better off under this contract**.

Therefore, **they should accept it**.

Moreover, you **get 6**, which is a lot better than 3.

Could you do even better?

Try increasing the A0 bonus.

Suppose you try:
- A0: +2
- A1: -2

Then:
- Your payoffs:
  - (A0, A0): 5+2=7
  - (A0, A1): 0+2=2
  - (A1, A0): 3-2=1
  - (A1, A1): 3-2=1

So your best response:
- If they play A0: 7 vs 1 → prefer A0
- If they play A1: 2 vs 1 → prefer A0

So **A0 is dominant strategy** for you.

Their payoffs:
- If you play A0: lose 2 → get 5-2=3 (if A0), 3-2=1 (if A1)
- If you play A1: gain 2 → get 5+2=7 (if A0), 3+2=5 (if A1)

So their matrix:
| Their choice / Your choice | A0 | A1 |
|-----------------------------|----|----|
| A0                          | 3  | 7  |
| A1                          | 1  | 5  |

So if you play A0: prefer A0 (3 > 1)
If you play A1: prefer A0 (7 > 5)

So **A0 is dominant** for them.

Equilibrium: (A0, A0)

Your payoff: 5 + 2 = 7
Their payoff: 5 - 2 = 3

Now: you get 7, they get 3.

But **they get same as no contract** (3), but **no better**.

So they are **indifferent** to accepting.

But do we assume they accept if indifferent?

The contract is accepted if they **approve**.

Probably, we should assume they will **accept if they are weakly better off**, but perhaps only strictly better.

In this case, they do not get better — so they might reject.

But they get same as without contract.

So **no incentive to accept**.

Therefore, **they might reject**.

So to **ensure they accept**, we need them to **strictly benefit**.

So we need their total payoff > 3.

In the previous case with +1, -2: they got 4 > 3 → good.

Now with +2, -2: they get 3 → not good.

So **+2 is too much** — you get more, but they don’t.

Can we try A0: +1.5, A1: -1.5?

But values must be **integers**.

So we must choose integers.

Try:
- A0: +1
- A1: -1

Then:
- You: (A0,A0): 6, (A0,A1):1, (A1,A0):2, (A1,A1):2
- So you prefer A0 if they play A0 (6 vs 2), and if they play A1, you prefer A0 (1 vs 2) → wait, 1 < 2 → you prefer A1 if they play A1.

So not dominant.

Their payoffs:
- You play A0: they lose 1 → get 4 (A0), 2 (A1)
- You play A1: they gain 1 → get 6 (A0), 4 (A1)

So they prefer A0 in all cases → A0 dominant.

But you? If they play A1, you get 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → you prefer A1.

So if they play A1, you play A1.

But if you play A1, they prefer A0 → so they deviate → so (A1, A1) possible?

Suppose you play A1 → they get 6 if they play A0, 4 if A1 → so best to play A0 → so you deviate to A0.

So only (A0, A0) is stable? Let's see.

- If they play A0 → you get 6 vs 2 → prefer A0 → stable
- If you play A0 → they get 4 vs 2 → prefer A0
- If you play A1 → they get 6 vs 4 → prefer A0 → so you get A1 → they play A0 → you get 2 → but you prefer A0 → so deviate.

So **only (A0, A0)** is equilibrium.

Now, payoff:
- You: 5 + 1 = 6
- They: 5 - 1 = 4

Same as the +1, -2 case.

But you get same, and they get same, but this is simpler.

But earlier with +1, -2, you had a dominance for you.

But here, you don't dominate — but equilibrium still (A0, A0).

Now, to maximize your gain.

Try:
- A0: +1
- A1: -3 → but then they get more? Let's check.

Try:
- A0: +1
- A1: -2 → already tried: you get 6, they get 4

Try:
- A0: +1
- A1: -1 → you get 6, they get 4

Same.

Can you get **A0: +2**, **A1: -3**?

But then you get 7 when you play A0, but -0 when you play A1? No:

- A1: -3 → you lose 3

Then:
- You play A0 → get +2 → so 5+2=7
- You play A1 → get -3 → so 3-3=0

But if they play A1, you get: (A0,A1): 0+2=2, (A1,A1): 0

So if they play A1, you prefer A0 (2 vs 0)

If they play A0, you prefer A0 (7 vs 0) → so A0 is dominant.

Their payoffs:
- You play A0: they pay 2 → get 3 (A0), 1 (A1)
- You play A1: you pay 3 → they gain 3 → get 8 (A0), 6 (A1)

So they prefer A0 when you play A0 (3 > 1), and when you play A1, prefer A0 (8 > 6)

So A0 dominant.

Equilibrium: (A0, A0)

You get 5 + 2 = 7
They get 5 - 2 = 3

They get 3 — **same as no contract** — so might not approve.

So we need **them to get more than 3**.

So maximum you can give them is **3.999**, but since integers, **they must get at least 4**.

So they must get **5 - x ≥ 4** → x ≤ 1

So you can get **at most +1 bonus for A0** to ensure they get 4.

But also, the **penalty for A1**? You can make it large, but it doesn't affect their payoff directly.

But if you make A1 penalty large, you might make yourself less willing to play A1 — but if you have A0: +1, you already prefer A0.

But in the contract, you want **no possibility of bad outcome**, so you need **A0 to be the only equilibrium**.

With A0: +1, A1: -2, we had:
- You: (A0, A0):6, (A0,A1):1, (A1,A0):1, (A1,A1):1
- So if they play A0: you prefer A0 (6 vs 1)
- If they play A1: you get 1 vs 1 → indifferent → but then you are indifferent, but if you play A1, they get 5+2=7 if they play A0 → so they deviate → so you deviate back.

So only (A0,A0) is equilibrium.

And you get 6.

Can we do better?

Try **A0: +0**, **A1: -2**

Then:
- You: (A0,A0):5, (A0,A1):0, (A1,A0):1, (A1,A1):1
- If they play A0: you prefer A0 (5>1)
- If they play A1: you prefer A1 (0 vs 1) → so you play A1
- Then they get 5+2=7 if they play A0 → so they deviate → then you get 1 → prefer A0 → so back to A0.

But (A1,A1) possible?

If both play A1: you get 1, they get 3+2=5

But if you play A0, you get 0, but they play A1 → you get 0, but if you play A1, you get 1 → so you prefer A1.

But they get 5 if A1, but if they play A0, they get 7 → so they prefer A0 → so they deviate.

So equilibrium: A0 A0 → only.

Your payoff: 5
Their payoff: 5 - 0 = 5 → if you play A0, no transfer.

But you play A0 → they lose 0 → no loss.

So they get 5.

You get 5.

But without contract, you get 3.

So both get more: 5 > 3.

And you get **5**, which is better than 6? No, 5 < 6.

But earlier with +1, -2 you got **6**.

But here you get **5**.

So better to go with +1, -2.

But in +1, -2:
- You get 6
- They get 4

Is there a way to get more than 6?

Try:
- A0: +1
- A1: -2 → you get 6

Try A0: +1, A1: -3 → you get 6 still (since you play A0), and they get 5 - 1 = 4 still.

But you lose more if you play A1, but you don't.

So no benefit.

So **+1 and -2 gives you 6**.

Can you get **+2** and **A1 penalty higher**, but **still make them accept**?

Only if they get more than 3.

Suppose you set A0: +2, A1: 0

Then they get 5 - 2 = 3 if you play A0 — same as without.

So they are indifferent → might reject.

So no.

Try A0: +1, A1: -1 → you get 6, they get 4 → same as before.

So **best is to set A0: +1, A1: -2**.

Now, is there a contract where you get more?

What if you set A0: +1, A1: -2.

We already have that.

But in this case, you get 6.

But could you set A0: +1, A1: -2, and they accept — yes, because they get 4 > 3.

And you get 6 > 3.

And equilibrium is unique (A0, A0).

So **perfect**.

But wait: is there a contract where you get **7**?

Only if you get +2 for A0.

But then they get 3 → no incentive to accept.

So no.

Therefore, **optimal contract**: A0: +1, A1: -2.

But let me check if this is **stable**.

You play A0.

They play A0.

If they deviate to A1: they get 3 (base) -1 (contract) = 2 < 4 → worse.

If you deviate to A1: you get 3 - 2 (negative) = 1 < 6 → worse.

So yes, (A0, A0) is unique equilibrium.

And both get more than 3.

So accepted.

Could you set A0: +1, A1: -2, and that’s the best.

But is there a symmetric one?

No, you want to maximize your payoff.

Alternatively, could you set A0: +1, A1: -2.

But what if you set A0: +1, A1: -2.

Yes.

But in the output, values must be integers.

So final answer:

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": -2}
```

But wait — is there a contract where you get more by making them **more willing**?

Suppose you set A0: +1, A1: 0 → you get 6, they get 4 → same.

But then if they play A1, you are indifferent between A0 (1) and A1 (3) → so you prefer A1.

Then they get 5+0=5 if they play A0 → so deviate.

So they deviate to A0 → you get 6 → prefer A0.

So still (A0, A0) equilibrium.

But you get same 6.

But now no penalty on you for A1 — so **you might play A1 if they play A1**.

But they won’t.

But the outcome is same.

But with **stronger penalty (A1: -2)**, you are even more committed to A0.

So better for coordination.

So **+1, -2 is better**.

Therefore, this is optimal.

### ✅ Final Answer:

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To decide which contract(s) to approve, we need to evaluate how each contract influences the expected payoff in comparison to the original game without any contract. The objective is to maximize your total points received. Let's analyze each contract:

1. **Original Payoff Matrix:**

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
   & A0 & A1 \\
\hline
A0 & (5, 5) & (0, 3) \\
A1 & (3, 0) & (3, 3) \\
\end{array}
\]

2. **Contract proposed by Player 1:**

- **Additional Payment Details:**
  - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other player.
  - If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

Let's adjust the original payoffs with Player 1's contract:

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
   & A0 & A1 \\
\hline
A0 & (5+4-4, 5+4-4) & (0+4-4, 3-4+4) \\
A1 & (3-4+4, 0+4-4) & (3, 3) \\
\end{array}
\]

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
   & A0 & A1 \\
\hline
A0 & (5, 5) & (0, 3) \\
A1 & (3, 0) & (3, 3) \\
\end{array}
\]

Thus, the payoffs remain unchanged by Player 1's contract.

3. **Contract proposed by Player 2:**

- **Additional Payment Details:**
  - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
  - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Let's adjust the original payoffs with Player 2's contract:

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
   & A0 & A1 \\
\hline
A0 & (5+2-2, 5+2-2) & (0+2-2, 3-2+2) \\
A1 & (3-2+2, 0+2-2) & (3-2+2, 3-2+2) \\
\end{array}
\]

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
   & A0 & A1 \\
\hline
A0 & (5, 5) & (0, 3) \\
A1 & (3, 0) & (3, 3) \\
\end{array}
\]

Again, the payoffs remain unchanged by Player 2's contract.

Since the contracts do not have any effect on the payoffs and the game strategy remains the same, both contracts are neutral from a payoff perspective. To avoid bias, it’s logical to approve both or neither.

To ensure the process is fair and fulfills the requirement of uniform consideration, approving all contracts or none is appropriate. Here, I will choose to approve both contracts.

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

This ensures that in the event of random selection, both contracts are treated equally. The final decision returns both contracts with an approval disposition given they result in the same endgame as the original rules.

To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the base game and the impact of the proposed contracts.

### Base Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for the base game is:
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

In this game, there are two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding 5 points each, and (A1, A1) yielding 3 points each. While (A0, A0) is the social and individual optimum, (A1, A1) is safer because A1 guarantees at least 3 points regardless of the other player's move, whereas choosing A0 risks receiving 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

### Contract Analysis
Both proposed contracts (C1 and C2) are identical:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

Let's calculate the new payoffs under these contracts:
- **(A0, A0):** 
    - Player 1: 5 (base) + 4 (from Pl1 choosing A0) - 4 (given to Pl2 choosing A0) = 5
    - Player 2: 5 (base) + 4 (from Pl2 choosing A0) - 4 (given to Pl1 choosing A0) = 5
- **(A0, A1):** 
    - Player 1: 0 (base) + 4 (from Pl1 choosing A0) - 0 = 4
    - Player 2: 3 (base) + 0 - 4 (given to Pl1 choosing A0) = -1
- **(A1, A0):** 
    - Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 - 4 (given to Pl2 choosing A0) = -1
    - Player 2: 0 (base) + 4 (from Pl2 choosing A0) - 0 = 4
- **(A1, A1):** 
    - Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 - 0 = 3
    - Player 2: 3 (base) + 0 - 0 = 3

### Determining Dominant Strategies
Under the contract:
- If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 5 for A0 and -1 for A1. (A0 is better)
- If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 4 for A0 and 3 for A1. (A0 is better)

With the contract in place, A0 becomes a **strictly dominant strategy** for both players. This ensures both players will choose A0, resulting in the maximum possible payoff of 5 points for both. Without the contract, players might gravitate toward the "safer" (A1, A1) equilibrium to avoid the risk of getting 0 points.

Therefore, both C1 and C2 significantly improve the likelihood of achieving the 5-point outcome.

To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the game and the proposed contracts step by step.

### 1. Original Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for the original game is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two Nash Equilibria: (**A0, A0**) yielding 5 points and (**A1, A1**) yielding 3 points. While (A0, A0) is the best outcome, it is risky. If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you receive 0 points. Conversely, (A1, A1) is the "safer" risk-dominant equilibrium because A1 ensures at least some points regardless of the opponent's choice.

### 2. Contract C1 Analysis
Contract C1 states: If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** P1 gets 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**; P2 gets 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**.
- **(A0, A1):** P1 gets 0 + 4 = **4**; P2 gets 3 - 4 = **-1**.
- **(A1, A0):** P1 gets 3 - 4 = **-1**; P2 gets 0 + 4 = **4**.
- **(A1, A1):** P1 gets **3**; P2 gets **3**.

Under C1, A0 becomes a **strictly dominant strategy**. Regardless of what the other player does, choosing A0 provides a higher payoff (5 vs -1, or 4 vs 3). This guarantees both players will choose A0, resulting in **5 points**.

### 3. Contract C2 Analysis
Contract C2 states: If a player chooses A1, they pay 4 points to the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** P1 gets **5**; P2 gets **5**.
- **(A0, A1):** P1 gets 0 + 4 = **4**; P2 gets 3 - 4 = **-1**.
- **(A1, A0):** P1 gets 3 - 4 = **-1**; P2 gets 0 + 4 = **4**.
- **(A1, A1):** P1 gets 3 - 4 + 4 = **3**; P2 gets 3 - 4 + 4 = **3**.

Under C2, the result is identical to C1. A0 becomes the **strictly dominant strategy**, ensuring both players choose A0 and receive **5 points**.

### 4. Decision
Both contracts transform the game from a coordination problem with risks into a game with a single dominant strategy (A0) that leads to the best possible payoff (5 points). Since both contracts serve the objective of maximizing points and eliminate the risk of ending up in the inferior (A1, A1) equilibrium or the 0-point outcome, they are both highly beneficial.

response:
Based on the payoff matrix of the basic game, both players have two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) with 5 points each and (A1, A1) with 3 points each. While (A0, A0) is the better outcome, (A1, A1) is "safer" because playing A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's decision, whereas playing A0 entails a risk of getting 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

The proposed contracts (C1 and C2) are identical. Any contract that is implemented would result in the following modified payoff matrix:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

Under this contract:
1.  **Dominant Strategy:** A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both players. If the other player plays A0, you get 5 with A0 versus -1 with A1. If the other player plays A1, you get 4 with A0 versus 3 with A1.
2.  **Safety:** A0 also becomes the "safer" strategy, as the minimum payoff for A0 is 4, while the minimum payoff for A1 is -1.
3.  **Outcome:** The game will converge to the (A0, A0) equilibrium, which provides the maximum possible points (5) to both players.

Since the contracts change the game from having multiple equilibria to having a single, dominant, and more profitable equilibrium for both parties, both C1 and C2 are highly beneficial to Player 1.

To determine which contracts to approve, we need to analyze the resulting payoff matrices for each proposed contract and compare them to the base game.

### Base Game Payoff Matrix
The original payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) are:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) yields 5 points, it is risky because if the other player switches to A1, Player 1 receives 0. Action A1 is "safer" because it guarantees 3 points regardless of the opponent's choice, potentially leading to the (3, 3) equilibrium or a mixed-strategy equilibrium (also yielding 3 points).

### Contract 1 (C1) Analysis
- **A0 Payment:** +4 from the other player.
- **A1 Payment:** 0.

New Payoff Matrix (C1):
- **(A0, A0):** (5 + 4 - 4, 5 + 4 - 4) = **(5, 5)**
- **(A0, A1):** (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = **(4, -1)**
- **(A1, A0):** (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = **(-1, 4)**
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3) = **(3, 3)**

In C1, if Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 prefers A0 (5 > -1). if Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 prefers A0 (4 > 3). **A0 is a dominant strategy**, leading to the (5, 5) result.

### Contract 2 (C2) Analysis
- **A0 Payment:** +2 from the other player.
- **A1 Payment:** -2 to the other player.

New Payoff Matrix (C2):
- **(A0, A0):** (5 + 2 - 2, 5 + 2 - 2) = **(5, 5)**
- **(A0, A1):** (0 + 2 + 2, 3 - 2 - 2) = **(4, -1)**
- **(A1, A0):** (3 - 2 - 2, 0 + 2 + 2) = **(-1, 4)**
- **(A1, A1):** (3 - 2 + 2, 3 - 2 + 2) = **(3, 3)**

In C2, the calculations result in the exact same matrix as C1. **A0 is a dominant strategy**, leading to the (5, 5) result.

### Conclusion
Both contracts effectively transform the game from a risky coordination game into a game with a dominant strategy (A0) that yields the maximum possible payoff (5 points). No Contract carries a risk of ending up with only 3 points (the safe/maximin equilibrium). Therefore, approving both contracts maximizes the probability of securing 5 points.

response:
To maximize points in this scenario, we first need to analyze the payoff structure of the original game and how the proposed contracts modify it.

### 1. Original Game Analysis
The original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this "Stag Hunt" game, there are two Nash Equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: Yields 5 points each (Payoff-dominant).
- **(A1, A1)**: Yields 3 points each (Risk-dominant).

While (A0, A0) is superior, it is risky. If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you receive 0 points. If both players are risk-averse, they may settle for the safer (A1, A1) equilibrium, earning only 3 points each.

### 2. Contract Analysis
Both proposed contracts (C1 and C2) are identical:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points, taken from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

Adjusting the payoffs for Player 2 (your position) with either contract:
- **(A0, A0)**: 5 points (Original) + 4 (for playing A0) - 4 (taken for P1's A0) = **5 points**.
- **(A0, A1)**: 3 points (Original) - 4 (taken for P1's A0) = **-1 point**. (Wait, P2 plays A1, P1 plays A0)
- **(A1, A0)**: 0 points (Original) + 4 (for playing A0) = **4 points**. (Wait, P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1)
- **(A1, A1)**: 3 points (Original) + 0 = **3 points**.

Let's re-verify the matrix for Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1). Choose A0.
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1). Choose A0.

### 3. Conclusion
With either contract in place, **A0 becomes a dominant strategy** for both players. In a game where both players play their dominant strategy, the outcome will be (A0, A0), and both will receive 5 points. This is the highest possible payoff in the game and removes the risk of ending up at the lower-paying (A1, A1) equilibrium.

Since both contracts facilitate the best possible outcome and are identical, it is in your best interest to approve both.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
To evaluate the proposed contracts, we first analyze the original payoff matrix (Player 1 \ Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In the original game, there are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). However, (A1, A1) is the risk-dominant equilibrium because playing A1 guarantees 3 points, whereas playing A0 is risky (offering 5 or 0 points).

Now we evaluate the proposed contracts:

**Contract 1 (C1):**
- Choosing A0 adds 4 points (taken from the other player). Choosing A1 has no payment.
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 + 4 - 4 = 5.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 + 4 - 0 = 4; P2 gets 3 - 4 + 0 = -1.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3 - 4 + 0 = -1; P2 gets 0 + 4 - 0 = 4.
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 + 0 + 0 = 3.
- Resulting Matrix for C1: (A0, A0)=(5,5), (A0, A1)=(4,-1), (A1, A0)=(-1,4), (A1, A1)=(3,3). 
In this matrix, A0 is a strictly dominant strategy (5 > -1 and 4 > 3). Rational players will both play A0, resulting in 5 points each.

**Contract 2 (C2):**
- Choosing A0 adds 2 points (taken from the other player). Choosing A1 costs 2 points (given to the other player).
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 + 2 - 2 = 5.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 + 2 (for playing A0) + 2 (from P2 playing A1) = 4; P2 gets 3 - 2 - 2 = -1.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3 - 2 - 2 = -1; P2 gets 0 + 2 + 2 = 4.
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 - 2 + 2 = 3.
- Resulting Matrix for C2: (A0, A0)=(5,5), (A0, A1)=(4,-1), (A1, A0)=(-1,4), (A1, A1)=(3,3).
As with C1, A0 becomes a strictly dominant strategy, guaranteeing 5 points for both players.

Both contracts effectively remove the risk of playing A0 and coordinate the players toward the optimal (5, 5) outcome. Therefore, approving both is in the best interest of Player 1.

### Step 1: Baseline incentives (no contract)
Your payoffs (Player 2):

- If Player 1 plays **A0**: you prefer **A0** (5 > 3)
- If Player 1 plays **A1**: you prefer **A1** (3 > 0)

So the base game has coordination structure (two pure equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)).

---

### Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)
Rule: choosing **A0** gives you **+5** taken from the other player (so the other player pays **-5**).

So your payoff adjustment is:
- **+5** if you play A0
- **-5** if Player 1 plays A0 (because they take it from you)

Compute your resulting payoffs:

- (A0, A0): 5 + 5 − 5 = **5**
- (A0, A1): 3 + 0 − 5 = **−2**
- (A1, A0): 0 + 5 − 0 = **5**
- (A1, A1): 3 + 0 − 0 = **3**

Best responses:
- If Player 1 plays A0: A0 (5 > −2)
- If Player 1 plays A1: A0 (5 > 3)

So **A0 becomes strictly dominant** ⇒ outcome goes to **(A0, A0)** with payoff **5** for you.

Conclusion: **Approve C1**.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)
Rule:
- If you play **A0**: you receive **+2** from the other player
- If you play **A1**: you pay **2** to the other player

Your payoff adjustment depends on both actions:
- From your action: +2 if A0, −2 if A1
- From Player 1’s action: −2 if they play A0 (they take it from you), +2 if they play A1 (they pay you)

Compute your resulting payoffs:

- (A0, A0): 5 +2 −2 = **5**
- (A0, A1): 3 −2 −2 = **−1**
- (A1, A0): 0 +2 +2 = **4**
- (A1, A1): 3 −2 +2 = **3**

Best responses:
- If Player 1 plays A0: A0 (5 > −1)
- If Player 1 plays A1: A0 (4 > 3)

So again **A0 is strictly dominant** ⇒ outcome **(A0, A0)** with payoff **5** for you.

Conclusion: **Approve C2**.

---

### Step 4: Approval strategy
Both contracts implement the same equilibrium outcome for you (A0,A0) with payoff 5, and approving both cannot reduce your payoff under the contract-selection rule.

So approve both.

response:
To address this problem systematically, let's break down the steps needed to make an informed decision on whether to sign the contract.

### Step 1: Understand the Basic Payoff Matrix without the Contract

#### Original Payoff Matrix:
|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)      | (0, 3)        |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)      | (3, 3)        |

### Step 2: Analyze the Payoff Matrix with the Contract

If both players sign the contract, the payouts change because:
- Choosing A0 receives an additional payment of 4 points from the other player.
- Choosing A1 involves no additional payments.

Here’s the adjusted payoff matrix considering the contract:

#### Adjusted Payoff Matrix with Contract:
|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (9, 1)      | (4, -1)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (7, -1)     | (3, 3)        |

Here is the breakdown:
- If both choose A0: Player 1 gets 5 + 4 = 9 and Player 2 gets 5 - 4 = 1.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 + 4 = 4 and Player 2 gets 3 - 4 = -1.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 - 4 = -1 and Player 2 gets 0 + 4 = 4.
- If both choose A1: Both get 3.

### Step 3: Compare Strategies with and without the Contract

#### Without Contract:
Total payoffs based on strategy decisions:
- Cooperative (both choose A0): (5, 5) = Total 10 points.
- Mixed Strategy: Depending on probability, but overall worse than both cooperating.

#### With Contract:
Total payoffs based on strategy decisions:
- Cooperative (both choose A0): (9, 1) = Total 10 points. Player 1 is vastly better off.
- Mixed Strategy: Not appealing, as deviation to A1 for either player unilaterally reduces total payoff.

### Step 4: Strategic Considerations as Player 2 (My Perspective)
- The contract heavily skews benefits toward Player 1 when both cooperate while making my payoff significantly worse if both cooperate.
- If I don't sign the contract and Player 1 does, we revert to the original payoff structure which is more equitable.
- Evaluating potential outcomes:
  - If both don't sign: (5, 5) is a preferred outcome over any other mixed strategy.
  - If I sign and Player 1 defects (A1): I receive -1, which is significantly negative.

### Step 5: Decision

Considering the adjusted and original payoffs, signing the contract is detrimental to me as Player 2:

**Recommendation:** Do not sign the contract.

To determine which contracts to approve, let's analyze the game's payoff matrix and how each contract modifies it.

### **1. Original Payoff Matrix**
Based on the description:
- **(A0, A0)**: P1 = 5, P2 = 5
- **(A0, A1)**: P1 = 3, P2 = 0
- **(A1, A0)**: P1 = 0, P2 = 3
- **(A1, A1)**: P1 = 3, P2 = 3

*Note: Since you are Player 2, your payoffs are the second number in each pair.*

In this coordination game, there are two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria: **(A0, A0)** with payoff (5, 5) and **(A1, A1)** with payoff (3, 3). (A0, A0) is the most efficient outcome for both players, but there is a risk of coordinating on the less efficient (A1, A1).

---

### **2. Contract Analysis**

**Contract C1 (Transfer 5 if choosing A0):**
If a player chooses A0, they receive 5 points from the other player.
- **(A0, A0)**: Both choose A0. Each gets 5, pays 5. Net: (5+5-5, 5+5-5) = **(5, 5)**.
- **(A0, A1)**: P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1. P1: 3+5=8. P2: 0-5=-5. (Wait, re-reading: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3 initially? Let's use the matrix from the rules).
  *Correction using rules:* (A0, A1) is P1=0, P2=3 (P2 chose A1). P1: 0+5-0=5. P2: 3+0-5=-2. Result: **(5, -2)**.
- **(A1, A0)**: P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0. P1: 3+0-5=-2. P2: 0+5-0=5. Result: **(-2, 5)**.
- **(A1, A1)**: Both choose A1. No transfers. Result: **(3, 3)**.

Under C1, A0 is now a **dominant strategy** for both players because the payoff for A0 is always greater than the payoff for A1 (5 > -2 and 5 > 3). This guarantees the (5, 5) outcome.

**Contract C2 (Transfer 4 if choosing A0):**
If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- **(A0, A0)**: Net: (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = **(5, 5)**.
- **(A0, A1)**: P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1. P1: 0+4-0=4. P2: 3+0-4=-1. Result: **(4, -1)**.
- **(A1, A0)**: P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0. P1: 3+0-4=-1. P2: 0+4-0=4. Result: **(-1, 4)**.
- **(A1, A1)**: No transfers. Result: **(3, 3)**.

Under C2, A0 is also a **dominant strategy** for both players (5 > -1 and 4 > 3). This also guarantees the (5, 5) outcome.

---

### **3. Decision**
Both C1 and C2 effectively turn A0 into a dominant strategy, ensuring that both players will choose A0 and receive 5 points. This eliminates the risk of coordinating on the less desirable (A1, A1) Nash equilibrium or ending up in one of the 0-point outcomes. Since both contracts result in the maximum possible payout (5 points), you should approve both.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the game's payoff structure before and after the proposed contract.

### Original Game Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
| | A0 | A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

In the original game, there are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5) and (A1, A1) with payoffs (3, 3). While (A0, A0) is significantly better for both players, choosing A0 is risky: if Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 receives 0.

### The Contract:
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points and the other player loses 4 points.
- If a player chooses A1, no points are exchanged.

### Revised Game Matrix (with Contract):
If both players sign, the payouts change as follows:
- **(A0, A0):**
  - Player 1: 5 + 4 (for playing A0) - 4 (because P2 played A0) = 5
  - Player 2: 5 + 4 (for playing A0) - 4 (because P1 played A0) = 5
- **(A0, A1):**
  - Player 1: 0 + 4 (for playing A0) - 0 (because P2 played A1) = 4
  - Player 2: 3 - 4 (because P1 played A0) = -1
- **(A1, A0):**
  - Player 1: 3 - 4 (because P2 played A0) = -1
  - Player 2: 0 + 4 (for playing A0) = 4
- **(A1, A1):**
  - Player 1: 3 (no changes) = 3
  - Player 2: 3 (no changes) = 3

**Revised Matrix:**
| | A0 | A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **A0** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **A1** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

### Analysis of the Contract:
1.  **Dominant Strategy:** In the revised matrix, A0 is now a dominant strategy for both players. Regardless of what Player 2 does, Player 1 gets more points by playing A0 (5 > -1 and 4 > 3).
2.  **Security:** In the original game, playing A0 carried the risk of getting 0 points if the other player chose A1. With the contract, playing A0 guarantees at least 4 points even if the other player chooses A1.
3.  **Coordination:** The contract eliminates the lower-payoff Nash Equilibrium (A1, A1) and ensures that rational play leads to (A0, A0).

Since the contract makes the optimal outcome (A0, A0) the only Nash Equilibrium and eliminates the risk of trying to coordinate on that outcome, signing it is highly beneficial.

Step 1: Baseline game (no contract)
- My best response to A0 is A0 (5 > 3).
- My best response to A1 is A1 (3 > 0).
So the base game has two pure equilibria: (A0,A0) giving me 5, and (A1,A1) giving me 3.

Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)
Rule: If you play A0 you get +4 transferred from the other player; A1 has no transfer.
With 2 players, this implies:
- If both play A0, they each send/receive 4, so net transfer is 0 → payoffs stay (5,5).
- If I play A0 and the other plays A1, I receive 4 → my payoff becomes 0+4=4.
- If I play A1 and the other plays A0, I pay 4 → my payoff becomes 3−4=−1.
- If both play A1, unchanged at 3.

My incentives under C1:
- If the other plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives −1 → choose A0.
- If the other plays A1: A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3 → choose A0.
So A0 becomes strictly dominant for me (and symmetrically for the other player). That makes (A0,A0) the unique equilibrium, giving me 5 points. This is very good for me.

Conclusion: Approve C1.

Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)
Rule: If you play A0 you receive +2 from the other; if you play A1 you pay 2 to the other.
With 2 players:
- (A0,A0): net transfer 0 → still (5,5).
- (A0,A1): I get +2 → my payoff 0+2=2.
- (A1,A0): I pay 2 → my payoff 3−2=1.
- (A1,A1): net transfer 0 → still (3,3).

My incentives under C2:
- If the other plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives 1 → choose A0.
- If the other plays A1: A0 gives 2 vs A1 gives 3 → choose A1.
So it does *not* eliminate the bad (A1,A1) equilibrium; it keeps the coordination problem.

Strategic voting consideration:
- C1 is the contract that guarantees the high-payoff outcome (A0,A0) via dominance.
- If I also approve C2, and Player 1 approves both, then C1 and C2 could tie in approvals and be selected 50/50, lowering my expected value versus making C1 the unique winner.

Conclusion: Reject C2 to reduce the chance of a tie and maximize the chance C1 is selected.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

response:
To determine the optimal probability distribution for Player 2's actions in this game, let's analyze the payoff matrix and potential strategies.

### Payoff Matrix Without Contract Modifications

The basic payoffs for each combination of actions are as follows:
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets 5 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets 3 points.

### Analysis of Strategies

#### Pure Strategies

1. **If Player 2 always chooses A0:**
   - If Player 1 also chooses A0: Player 2 gets 5 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 points.

   Expected payoff = \(5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p\), where \(p\) is the probability that Player 1 chooses A0.

2. **If Player 2 always chooses A1:**
   - If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 points.
   - If Player 1 also chooses A1: Player 2 gets 3 points.

   Expected payoff = \(3p + 3(1 - p) = 3\).

#### Mixed Strategies

To find a mixed strategy equilibrium, we need to find the probability \(p\) where Player 1 is indifferent between choosing A0 and A1. For Player 1:
- Payoff if choosing A0: \(5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q\).
- Payoff if choosing A1: \(3q + 3(1 - q) = 3\).

Here, \(q\) is the probability that Player 2 chooses A0.

For Player 1 to be indifferent:
\[5q = 3.\]
Solving for \(q\):
\[
q = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6.
\]

Similarly, we want Player 2 to be indifferent between choosing A0 and A1. If \(p\) is the probability that Player 1 chooses A0:
- Payoff if choosing A0: \(5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p\).
- Payoff if choosing A1: \(3p + 3(1 - p) = 3\).

For Player 2 to be indifferent:
\[5p = 3\].
Solving for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6.
\]

### Conclusion

Since both \(p\) and \(q\) are 0.6, both players should choose A0 with probability 0.6 and A1 with probability 0.4 to maximize their expected payoffs in a Nash equilibrium.

Thus, the optimal probability distribution for Player 2 is:
- 60% for A0.
- 40% for A1.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to compare the likely outcomes of the game with and without the contract.

### Game Without the Contract
The original payoffs are:
*   (A0, A0): 5, 5
*   (A0, A1): 0, 3
*   (A1, A0): 3, 0
*   (A1, A1): 3, 3

This is a coordination game. There are two Nash Equilibria in pure strategies: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) provides the highest payoff (5), it is risky because if you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you receive 0 points. Therefore, players might choose A1 (the "safer" option) to ensure they get at least 3 points, potentially leading to the less optimal (3, 3) equilibrium.

### Game With the Contract
The contract is active only if both players sign it. It adds a payment of 4 points from the other player if a player chooses A0.
Modified payoffs:
*   **(A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives 5 points. Additionally, each receives 4 from the other and pays 4 to the other. Total: **5, 5**.
*   **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1. P1 gets 0 + 4 (from P2) = 4 points. P2 gets 3 - 4 (to P1) = -1 point. Total: **4, -1**.
*   **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0. P1 gets 3 - 4 (to P2) = -1 point. P2 gets 0 + 4 (from P1) = 4 points. Total: **-1, 4**.
*   **(A1, A1):** Both choose A1. No additional payments. Total: **3, 3**.

### Comparison
If the contract is signed:
*   If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 5 for A0 and -1 for A1. (A0 is better)
*   If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 4 for A0 and 3 for A1. (A0 is better)
Under the contract, A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy**. Both players, acting rationally to maximize their own points, will choose A0, resulting in the maximum possible payoff of **5 points** each.

### Conclusion
The contract effectively removes the risk associated with choosing A0. Without the contract, players might settle for the inferior (3, 3) equilibrium or risk receiving 0 points. With the contract, players are incentivized to choose A0 regardless of the other's choice, steering the game toward the optimal (5, 5) outcome. As Player 1, signing the contract maximizes the probability of receiving 5 points.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the payoff matrices for both the original game and the contract-modified game.

**Original Game Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)  (Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 plays A1)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)  (Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 plays A0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this base game, there are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5) and (A1, A1) with payoffs (3, 3). While (A0, A0) is the best outcome for both, (A1, A1) is "safer" because playing A1 ensures at least 3 points, whereas playing A0 might result in 0 points if the other player switches to A1.

**Contract Modification:**
The contract states that if a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives 4 points and pays 4 points.
  - P1: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
  - P2: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1.
  - P1: 0 + 4 = 4
  - P2: 3 - 4 = -1
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0.
  - P1: 3 - 4 = -1
  - P2: 0 + 4 = 4
- **(A1, A1):** No additional payments.
  - P1: 3
  - P2: 3

**Contract-Modified Payoff Matrix:**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Analysis of the Modified Game:**
In the modified game, let's look at Player 2's options:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 5 (playing A0) or -1 (playing A1).
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 4 (playing A0) or 3 (playing A1).
In both cases, playing A0 yields a higher payoff for Player 2. Thus, A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy** for Player 2. The same logic applies to Player 1. 

**Conclusion:**
Signing the contract transforms the game into one where (A0, A0) is the unique Nash Equilibrium reached through dominant strategies. This ensures an outcome of (5, 5). Without the contract, the players may settle on the risk-dominant equilibrium (A1, A1) yielding only 3 points each. Signing the contract aligns incentives toward the highest mutual payoff and eliminates the risk of receiving 0 points.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
```
                P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0          5, 5      0, 3
P2: A1          3, 0      3, 3
```

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 points ✓ (Best outcome)
- (A1, A1): I get 3 points

There's also a mixed strategy equilibrium where both players play A0 with probability 3/5, giving expected payoff of 3 points.

### Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1: Players choosing A0 receive +4 from the other player.

Modified payoffs:
```
                P1: A0       P1: A1
P2: A0          5, 5         4, -1
P2: A1         -1, 4         3, 3
```

Calculations:
- (A0, A0): Base 5 + receive 4 - pay 4 = 5
- (A0, A1): Base 0 + receive 4 = 4
- (A1, A0): Base 3 - pay 4 = -1
- (A1, A1): Base 3 (no payments) = 3

### Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2: Players choosing A1 pay 4 to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
```
                P1: A0       P1: A1
P2: A0          5, 5         4, -1
P2: A1         -1, 4         3, 3
```

Calculations:
- (A0, A0): Base 5 (no payments) = 5
- (A0, A1): Base 0 + receive 4 (P1 pays penalty) = 4
- (A1, A0): Base 3 - pay 4 (penalty) = -1
- (A1, A1): Base 3 - pay 4 + receive 4 = 3

**Key insight: Both contracts produce identical payoff structures!**

### Step 4: Find Equilibrium with Contracts

Under either contract, checking pure strategy equilibria:
- (A0, A0): Neither player wants to deviate (5 > -1). ✓ **Unique Nash Equilibrium**
- (A1, A1): I could deviate to A0 and get 4 > 3. Not an equilibrium.

### Step 5: Compare Outcomes

**Without contract:**
- Risk of coordination failure (might end up at (A1, A1) getting only 3)
- Risk of mixed strategy play (expected payoff of 3)

**With either contract:**
- Unique equilibrium at (A0, A0) giving me 5 points
- A0 becomes dominant strategy
- Eliminates coordination risk

### Conclusion

Both contracts are equivalent and beneficial. They:
1. Guarantee the best outcome (5 points)
2. Make A0 the dominant strategy
3. Eliminate any risk of coordination failure

I should approve both to maximize the probability that a contract is implemented.

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to compare the potential outcomes of the game with and without the contract.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The original payoff matrix for (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two Nash Equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: Both players receive 5 points.
- **(A1, A1)**: Both players receive 3 points.

While (A0, A0) is the better outcome for both, (A1, A1) is "safer" because if one player chooses A0 and the other deviates to A1, the player who chose A0 receives 0 points. This creates a coordination risk.

### 2. Analysis with the Contract
The contract specifies that any player choosing A0 receives 4 points, taken from the other players. If the contract is signed by both players, the modified payoff matrix becomes:
- **(A0, A0)**: 
    - Player 1: 5 (base) + 4 (from P2) - 4 (to P2) = 5
    - Player 2: 5 (base) + 4 (from P1) - 4 (to P1) = 5
- **(A0, A1)**: 
    - Player 1: 0 (base) + 4 (from P2) = 4
    - Player 2: 3 (base) - 4 (to P1) = -1
- **(A1, A0)**: 
    - Player 1: 3 (base) - 4 (to P2) = -1
    - Player 2: 0 (base) + 4 (from P1) = 4
- **(A1, A1)**: 
    - Player 1: 3
    - Player 2: 3

### 3. Strategy under the Contract
With the contract in place, let's look at Player 1's incentives:
- If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 5 points with A0, and -1 point with A1. (A0 is better)
- If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 4 points with A0, and 3 points with A1. (A0 is better)

Now A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy** for Player 1. The same applies to Player 2. When both players have A0 as a dominant strategy, they will both choose A0, leading to the outcome (5, 5).

### 4. Comparison and Conclusion
- **Without the contract**: Players face a coordination problem. They might reach (5, 5) but could also end up at (3, 3) or experience a mismatch (0 or 3).
- **With the contract**: The contract removes the risk of playing A0. Even if the other player plays A1, the player choosing A0 still receives 4 points (more than the 3 points they would get for playing A1). This guarantees that both players will rationally choose A0, resulting in the maximum possible payout of 5 points.

Since you are Player 1 and you proposed this contract to improve your outcome and stabilize the game at (A0, A0), signing it is the optimal decision.

response:
To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating the effects of the contract into the base payoffs.

**1. Analyze the Base Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**2. Incorporate the Contract:**
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points, taken from the other player(s).
- If a player chooses A1, no payment occurs.

Let's calculate the final payoffs for Player 1:
- **Case (A0, A0):**
  - Player 1 receives +4 for choosing A0 but loses 4 because Player 2 chose A0.
  - Final: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**
- **Case (A0, A1):**
  - Player 1 receives +4 for choosing A0. Player 2 chose A1, so no deduction for Player 1.
  - Final: 0 + 4 = **4**
- **Case (A1, A0):**
  - Player 1 chooses A1 (no bonus). Player 2 chooses A0, so Player 1 loses 4.
  - Final: 3 - 4 = **-1**
- **Case (A1, A1):**
  - No contract payments occur.
  - Final: **3**

**3. Determine the Optimal Strategy:**
Now we compare the final payoffs for Player 1 in each scenario based on Player 2's potential moves:
- **If Player 2 chooses A0:** Player 1 gets **5 points** with A0 and **-1 point** with A1. A0 is better.
- **If Player 2 chooses A1:** Player 1 gets **4 points** with A0 and **3 points** with A1. A0 is better.

In both scenarios, A0 yields a higher payoff for Player 1. Therefore, A0 is a strictly dominant strategy. Similarly, due to the symmetry of the game, A0 is also the dominant strategy for Player 2. Choosing A0 with 100% probability maximizes the expected points and aligns with the Nash Equilibrium of the modified game.

response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the base game and then evaluate how the proposed contract changes the incentives for both players.

### 1. Base Game Analysis
The base payoff matrix for (Player 1, Player 2) is:
*   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 3)
*   (A1, A0): (3, 0)
*   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this original game, there are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) resulting in 5 points each, and (A1, A1) resulting in 3 points each. While (A0, A0) is the Pareto optimal outcome, there is a risk: if one player chooses A0 and the other switches to or chooses A1, the player who chose A0 receives 0 points.

### 2. Contract Analysis
The proposed contract (which you, as Player 1, proposed) states:
*   A player choosing A0 receives +4 points from the other player.
*   A player choosing A1 receives/pays nothing extra.

**Modified Payoff Matrix with Contract (if signed by both):**
*   **(A0, A0):** Both choose A0. Both receive +4 and pay +4. Net change is 0.
    *   Player 1: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**
    *   Player 2: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**
*   **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 (+4), Player 2 chooses A1 (pays 4).
    *   Player 1: 0 + 4 = **4**
    *   Player 2: 3 - 4 = **-1**
*   **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1 (pays 4), Player 2 chooses A0 (+4).
    *   Player 1: 3 - 4 = **-1**
    *   Player 2: 0 + 4 = **4**
*   **(A1, A1):** No additional payments.
    *   Player 1: **3**
    *   Player 2: **3**

### 3. Incentives under the Contract
Under the contract, let's look at Player 1's incentives:
*   If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 5 points with A0 and -1 points with A1. (A0 is better)
*   If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 4 points with A0 and 3 points with A1. (A0 is better)

Choosing **A0 becomes a dominant strategy** for Player 1. The same logic applies to Player 2. Because both players have a dominant strategy to play A0, the game will reliably result in the (5, 5) outcome.

### 4. Conclusion
The contract effectively eliminates the risk of the (A1, A1) Nash equilibrium and the risk of receiving 0 points for trying to coordinate on (A0, A0). By making A0 the dominant strategy, the contract ensures both players receive the maximum possible payoff of 5 points. Since the contract stabilizes the best possible outcome for Player 1, signing it is the optimal choice.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.

Let's go step by step to analyze the game, the payoffs, and the contracts.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game Payoff Matrix**

We are **Player 2**, and the payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 (Player 1) | A1 (Player 1) |
|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**                         | 5, 5          | 0, 3          |
| **A1**                         | 3, 0          | 3, 3          |

So, from **your perspective (Player 2)**, the payoffs when you choose:
- A0: you get 5 if P1 chooses A0, 0 if P1 chooses A1
- A1: you get 3 if P1 chooses A0, 3 if P1 chooses A1

So your **best response** depends on P1’s strategy.

Let’s denote:
- $ p $: probability that Player 1 chooses A0
- $ 1-p $: probability that Player 1 chooses A1

Then your expected payoff for choosing:
- A0: $ 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p $
- A1: $ 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 $

So you choose A0 if $ 5p > 3 $ → $ p > 0.6 $

You choose A1 if $ p < 0.6 $

You are indifferent at $ p = 0.6 $

Now, what does Player 1 want?

Player 1's payoffs:

| Your Action \ P1's Action | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|----------------------------|---------|---------|
| A0 (P2)                    | 5, 5    | 3, 0    |
| A1 (P2)                    | 0, 3    | 3, 3    |

So P1's expected payoff from:
- Choosing A0: $ 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q $ where $ q $ is your (P2) probability of A0
- Choosing A1: $ 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 $

So P1 chooses A0 if $ 5q > 3 $ → $ q > 0.6 $

So the **Nash equilibrium** in pure strategies is **not obvious**, but notice:

- If both play A0: (5,5) — but each can deviate to A1 and get 3 (if other stays) → but wait:

Let’s check if there’s a pure strategy NE.

- (A0, A0): both get 5
    - P1: if deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no
    - P2: if deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no
    → So (A0, A0) is a **Nash equilibrium**

- (A1, A1): both get 3
    - P1: if deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3? No → but wait: if you (P2) play A1, and P1 switches to A0, then payoff is 3? Wait:

Wait — from P1’s perspective:
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 3 if plays A0, and 3 if plays A1 → indifferent. So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium only if P1 is indifferent.

But from (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3
From (A1, A1): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 3

So if both play A1: P1 gets 3. If P1 deviates to A0 while P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 (same), so okay.

Similarly P2: if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 3 no matter what → so A1 is best response.

So (A1, A1) is also a NE.

Now check (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3
- P1 would want to deviate to A1: gets 3 > 0 → so not NE

(A1, A0): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0
- P2 would want to deviate to A0: gets 5 > 0 → not NE

So two pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) — both get 5
- (A1, A1) — both get 3

But (A0, A0) is better for both.

However, (A1, A1) is also stable.

But in absence of coordination, they might fail to coordinate on (A0, A0).

But note: the game is similar to a **coordination game with a better outcome**.

Now: **is there a mixed strategy NE?**

Let’s look for a symmetric mixed strategy.

Suppose P1 plays A0 with probability $ p $

Then P2’s expected payoff:
- A0: $ 5p $
- A1: 3

So P2 is indifferent when $ 5p = 3 $ → $ p = 0.6 $

Similarly, P1 is indifferent when P2 plays A0 with probability $ q $ → $ 5q = 3 $ → $ q = 0.6 $

So **mixed strategy NE**: each plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%

Then expected payoff:
- For P2: $ 5*0.6 = 3 $ (from A0) or 3 (from A1) — so 3

So in mixed NE: both get 3.

But (A0, A0) gives 5 — better, but risk of not coordinating.

But for now, the **key point** is that **A0 is better for you if you think the other will cooperate**, but **A1 is safer**.

Now, contracts can change this.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+4 points**, drawn **equally from the other player(s)**.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So, this means:
- Choosing A0 → +4 points to self, -4 points to the other player (since total payment change is +4 -4 = 0, distributed from the other player).

Let’s compute **effective payoffs under C1**.

Assume both players **follow contract rules**, and we can model the **net payoff including the contract**.

Let’s define the **total payoff** for Player 2 in each case.

Remember: **you are Player 2**.

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|--------|---------|---------|
| A0     | 5 + 4 = 9, 5 - 4 = 1 | 0 + 4 = 4, 3 - 4 = -1 |
| A1     | 3 - 4 = -1, 0 + 4 = 4 | 3, 3 |

Wait — let's clarify:

When **a player chooses A0**, they get +4 **from the other player**.

So:
- If **you (P2)** choose A0 → you get +4 from P1
- If **P1** chooses A0 → P1 gets +4 from you

So total effect:
- (A0, A0): you get 5 (base) + 4 (from contract for choosing A0) = 9
    - P1 gets 5 + 4 = 9

But wait: the contract says “drawn equally from the other players” — so if both choose A0, each gets +4 from the other? That would be double payment?

But that can't be — total surplus would be +8, and no one loses.

Wait — the wording:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

“Drawn equally from the other players” → implies the cost is shared among other players.

But there’s only one other player.

So if **you** choose A0, you get +4, and **P1 pays 4** → P1’s total payoff is reduced by 4.

Similarly, if P1 chooses A0, P1 gets +4, and you (P2) pay 4.

So when both choose A0:
- You: base 5 + 4 = 9
- P1: base 5 + 4 = 9
→ But only one external source: so total extra +8? But both players gain +4 → total social gain +8?

But the cost is from “other players” — so if you get +4 from P1 when you play A0, that means P1 loses 4.

Similarly, P1 gets +4 from you if P1 plays A0 → you lose 4.

So if both play A0:
- You: +4 → from P1
- P1: +4 → from you

So net change: +8 total payoff? But that’s not a transfer — both gain.

Wait — but **money is extracted from the other player**.

So:
- If you play A0: you gain 4, **P1 pays 4**
- If P1 plays A0: P1 gains 4, **you pay 4**

So if both play A0:
- You get base 5 + contract +4 = 9
- P1 gets base 5 + contract +4 = 9
→ But you paid 4 to P1, and P1 paid 4 to you → net transfer: 0 between you.

So total payoffs: (9, 9)

But base was (5,5) → so total social gain of 8 → which is not sustainable.

Wait — that implies **money is created**? But that doesn’t make sense.

Let’s re-read: "drawn equally from the other players"

So if you choose A0, you get +4 — **and this is taken equally from the other player(s)**.

Since only one other player, that other player loses 4.

Similarly, if P1 chooses A0, P1 gains +4, and you lose 4.

So yes — if both choose A0:
- You: gain 4 from P1 → +4
- P1: gain 4 from you → +4
→ So both gain +4 → total +8 → **new total payoff = 5+5 +8 = 18**

But that means **the contract creates value** — which is possible if it’s a subsidy.

But that would be very good for both — but only if both cooperate.

But in this case, **C1 rewards A0** very strongly.

Let’s write the **effective payoffs under C1**:

| P2 \ P1 | A0            | A1            |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| A0     | 5+4=9, 5+4=9  | 0+4=4, 3−4=−1 |
| A1     | 3−4=−1, 0+4=4 | 3, 3          |

So for P2 (you):
- A0 vs A0: 9
- A0 vs A1: 4
- A1 vs A0: −1
- A1 vs A1: 3

So your expected payoff:

- Choose A0: get $ 9p + 4(1-p) = 9p + 4 - 4p = 5p + 4 $
- Choose A1: get $ -1p + 3(1-p) = -p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 4p $

Now compare: when is A0 better?
$ 5p + 4 > 3 - 4p $
→ $ 9p > -1 $ → always true for $ p \geq 0 $

Even at $ p = 0 $, A0 gives 4, A1 gives 3 → still better.

So **for all p**, A0 gives higher expected payoff to you.

So **you always prefer A0** under C1.

Similarly, P1’s payoffs:
- A0: 9p + 4(1-p) = 5p + 4
- A1: 4p + 3(1-p) = p + 3

Set equal: $ 5p + 4 = p + 3 $
→ $ 4p = -1 $ → impossible

So $ 5p + 4 > p + 3 $ for all p ≥ 0

So **P1 also always prefers A0**?

Wait — check p=0:
- P1 A0: 4
- P1 A1: 3 → so A0 better
p=1:
- A0: 9
- A1: 4 → still better

So yes — **both players prefer to play A0** under C1, **no matter what**.

So the only equilibrium is (A0, A0) → both get 9.

So **you get 9 under C1**.

Even better than base (5).

But is this stable? Yes — because if you deviate to A1, you get -1 (if P1 plays A0) or 3 (if P1 plays A1) — but if P1 plays A0 (which they will), you get -1 < 9 — not worth it.

So C1 induces (A0, A0) with payoff 9 for you.

So as Player 2, you **strongly benefit** from C1.

Now, **but wait** — the other players might prefer different things?

But recall: **you are deciding whether to approve C1**.

But **approval is independent**, and the contract is chosen **only if it has max approvals**.

So you should approve a contract if **it benefits you**, regardless of what others want — unless you expect others to play suboptimally.

But **you are maximizing your own points**.

So if C1 gives you 9 and is likely to be implemented (because both players want it), you should approve it.

But hold on — you must consider: **is C1 sustainable? Does it create incentives for others to play A0?**

Already checked: yes — both players **prefer A0** in all cases.

So C1 leads to (A0, A0), you get 9.

Now, what about **C2**?

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)** — i.e., **you** proposed it.

- If a player chooses A0, they receive +1 point, drawn equally from other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they **pay 2 points**, distributed equally among other players.

So:
- Choosing A0 → +1 to self, −1 to other
- Choosing A1 → −2 to self, +2 to other

Let’s write the **effective payoffs for you (P2)**.

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1)            | A1 (P1) |
|--------|--------------------|---------|
| A0     | 5+1=6, 5−1=4        | 0+1=1, 3+2=5 |
| A1     | 3−2=1, 0+1=1        | 3−2=1, 3+2=5 |

Wait: careful.

When you choose A0 → you gain +1, so you get +1 from P1.
When P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +1, you lose 1.

When you choose A1 → you give −2 to P1 → so you lose 2.
When P1 chooses A1 → P1 loses 2 → you gain 2.

So:

- (A0, A0): you get 5 (base) +1 (contract) = 6
    - P1 gets 5 +1 = 6

- (A0, A1): you get 0 (base) +1 (for A0) = 1
    - P1 gets 3 (base) −2 (because P1 chose A1) = 1
    Wait — P1 chooses A1 → so P1 pays −2 → so P1’s total is 3 −2 = 1
    You pay +2 to P1? No: when P1 chooses A1, they **pay 2 points to you** → so you gain +2
    So from base 0 + contract: you get +2 → so 0 +2 = 2?

Wait — confusion.

Let’s clarify: the **contract payments are added to the base payoff**, and are drawn from the other player.

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +1
- If **you** choose A1 → you pay -2 → so -2
- If **P1** chooses A0 → P1 gets +1
- If **P1** chooses A1 → P1 pays -2 → so -2

So total payoff:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|--------|---------|---------|
| A0 (P2) | 5 +1 = 6, 5 +1 = 6 | 0 +1 = 1, 3 −2 = 1 |
| A1 (P2) | 3 −2 = 1, 0 +1 = 1 | 3 −2 = 1, 3 −2 = 1 |

Wait — this can’t be right.

No: the **contract affects only the player choosing the action**.

So for you (P2), when:
- You choose A0: you get +1
- You choose A1: you get -2

For P1:
- P1 chooses A0: +1
- P1 chooses A1: -2

So the effective payoffs:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|--------|---------|---------|
| A0     | 5 + 1 = 6, 5 + 1 = 6 | 0 + 1 = 1, 3 − 2 = 1 |
| A1     | 3 − 2 = 1, 0 + 1 = 1 | 3 − 2 = 1, 3 − 2 = 1 |

Wait — in (A1, A1): 
- You get 3 (base) − 2 (contract) = 1
- P1 gets 3 − 2 = 1

Yes.

So payoffs:

- (A0, A0): (6,6)
- (A0, A1): (1,1)
- (A1, A0): (1,1)
- (A1, A1): (1,1)

Wait — that can’t be — base (A0, A1) is (0,3), now with contract:
- You: 0 (base) +1 (you played A0) = 1
- P1: 3 (base) −2 (P1 played A1) = 1

Same for others.

So **all outcomes give you 1, except (A0,A0) which gives you 6**.

So your payoff depends on both playing A0.

Now, what is **your incentive**?

You want to play A0 only if P1 plays A0.

Because if P1 plays A0:
- You get: A0 → 6, A1 → 1 → so prefer A0

If P1 plays A1:
- You get: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent

So your best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → play A0
- If P1 plays A1 → indifferent

Now, what does P1 want?

P1’s payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 5+1=6
- (A0,A1): 3−2=1
- (A1,A0): 0+1=1
- (A1,A1): 3−2=1

So P1:
- If you play A0 → prefers A0 (6 vs 1)
- If you play A1 → indifferent (1 vs 1)

So P1 wants A0 if you play A0.

So (A0, A0) is a **Nash equilibrium**: both want to play A0 if the other does.

But (A1, A1) is **not** a NE — because if P1 plays A1 and you play A1, then if P1 switches to A0, they get 1 (same) → but wait: if you play A1, and P1 switches to A0:
- P1 gets 0 (base) +1 = 1 → same as before → so indifferent.

But if P1 plays A0 and you play A1: P1 gets 1 (as above)

But you get: if you play A1 and P1 plays A0 → you get 3 −2 = 1

So actually, **any action by you is fine** — but if P1 plays A1, then you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Similarly, P1 is indifferent if you play A1.

So **(A1,A1)** is a **NE** only if both are indifferent.

But if both are indifferent, then it's a NE.

But is there a **better** NE?

Yes: (A0,A0) is also a NE.

But now — **what if both players think they will play A0?**

But under C2, the payoffs are:

- (A0,A0): (6,6)
- (all others): (1,1)

But now: **is (A0,A0) the only stable outcome?**

Suppose both are playing A1: (1,1)

But if you deviate to A0, and P1 plays A1 → you get 1 (same) → so you don’t gain.

Similarly, P1 doesn’t gain.

So (A1,A1) is a NE.

But it gives you only 1 → much worse than 6.

So if you can coordinate on (A0,A0), you get 6.

But without coordination, **you might fall into (A1,A1)** — because if one player thinks the other will play A1, they are indifferent — so may play A1.

In fact, **(A1,A1) is more stable** because if both expect A1, they stay.

But (A0,A0) is risky — if either deviates, both get 1, but if both cooperate, both get 6.

So it’s like a **battle of the sexes** or **Stag Hunt**.

But **you are trying to maximize your points** — so you want **high probability of (A0,A0)**.

But under C2, **there is no incentive to coordinate** unless you expect cooperation.

But more importantly: **you proposed C2** — so you don’t care about others’ approval unless it affects outcome.

But crucially: **C2 gives you 6 if both play A0, but only 1 otherwise**.

But **in the absence of coordination, you might end up in (A1,A1)**.

But is there a dominant strategy?

No — because if you play A0, you get 6 if P1 plays A0, 1 if P1 plays A1.

If you play A1, you get 1 regardless.

So your **best strategy depends on P1’s action**.

Similarly for P1.

But now: **what are the incentives for approving C2?**

You are proposing it — so you want it to be adopted.

But the key is: **the winning contract is selected at random from the ones with maximum approvals**.

So you get to influence which one wins — by approving or not.

But **you want the contract that gives you the most **points, assuming it is implemented.

Now compare:

- **C1**: if approved and implemented, leads to (A0,A0) → you get **9**
- **C2**: if approved and implemented, leads to either (A0,A0) giving you 6, or **worse** (1) if coordination fails.

So **C1 guarantees 9**, while **C2 gives you at best 6**, and likely worse.

So **C1 is strictly better**.

But why would you approve C2?

Only if you think it will lead to better outcomes — but in this case, it doesn't.

Now, but — **does C2 create incentive for P1 to play A0?**

Yes — if you play A0, P1 gets 6 if A0, 1 if A1 → so wants A0.

But you only get 6 if P1 plays A0.

But under C2, **your best outcome is 6**, but **you could get 9 in C1**.

So even as proposer of C2, you prefer C1.

But **can you approve both?**

Yes — approval is independent.

But the winning contract is the one with **max approvals**.

Suppose you approve C1 but not C2.

Then:
- Approval count: C1: 1 (if P1 approves), C2: 0
→ C1 wins (1 > 0)

Suppose you approve both:
- C1: 2 (if P1 approves), C2: 1 (you)
→ C1 wins again

Suppose you don’t approve C1, approve C2: then C2 has 1, C1 has 1 → random winner.

But you **prefer C1**.

So to maximize the chance of C1 winning, you should approve C1.

But also — you want contract that maximizes your payoff.

Now — **does C2 have any benefit over C1 for you?**

No — C1 gives 9, C2 gives at most 6.

So **C2 is worse**.

Moreover, **C2 may lead to lower outcomes** if there’s no coordination.

But C1 **guarantees** you get 9.

So you should **approve C1**, and **not approve C2**.

But **why would you not approve C2**?

Because it’s suboptimal for you.

But wait — **are you the proposer of C2**? Yes — but you are not required to approve it.

Approving a contract means you support its adoption.

But since C2 gives you less than C1, you should not approve C2.

Moreover: **if you approve both, then C1 will win** (as long as P1 approves C1), so C2 wins only if C1 gets fewer approvals — which is risky.

But if you approve C1 and not C2, then C1 has at least 1 approval, C2 has 1 (only you), so C1 wins.

If you deny C1, and approve C2, then C1 has fewer approvals, so could lose.

So to maximize your payoff, you should:

- Approve C1 ✅ (because it gives you 9)
- Do not approve C2 ❌ (because it gives you at most 6, and risks worse)

But is there a reason to approve C2?

Only if it increases chance of C1 winning — but no, approving C2 reduces C1’s chance (if P1 also approves C1), because approvals are counted, and C1 will tie or lose if both approved.

But if you approve C1 and C2:
- C1: 2 (you and P1)
- C2: 1 (you)

→ C1 wins

Even if you approve both, C1 still wins.

But if you **don’t** approve C1, then:
- C1: 1 (only P1)
- C2: 1 (you)
→ tie → random winner → 50% chance of C2 (your proposal), 50% of C1.

But in this case:
- C1: you get 9
- C2: you get at most 6 → 50% chance of 9, 50% chance of ≤6 → expected ~7.5

But if you approve C1, then C1 wins with probability 1 (assuming P1 approves C1), so you get 9 for sure.

So better to approve C1.

And not approve C2.

But what if P1 **does not approve C1**? Then:

- If you approve C1: C1 has 1
- C2 has 1 → tie → random: 50% chance of C1 → you get 9 with 50% prob → expected 4.5
- But if you approve C2 only: C2 has 1 → wins → you get at most 6

So you would prefer to approve C1 even if P1 rejects it — because expected value (4.5) > 6? No: 4.5 < 6.

Wait: if you don’t approve C1, and only approve C2:
- C2 wins → you get 6 (if (A0,A0) is played) → but is it?

Under C2, (A0,A0) is equilibrium — so yes, if both are playing rationally, they'll play (A0,A0) → you get 6.

But under C1, if it wins, you get 9.

But if P1 rejects C1, then C1 gets only your approval → C2 gets your approval → tie → random.

So 50% chance of C1 (you get 9), 50% chance of C2 (you get 6) → expected payoff: 7.5

But if you **don’t approve C1**, and only approve C2:
- C2 wins → you get 6 → less than 7.5

So better to approve C1 **even if P1 might not approve it**, because of the chance.

But you don’t know P1’s decision — but you control your own.

To **maximize your expected payoff**, you should approve C1 regardless, because:
- If P1 approves C1: C1 wins → you get 9
- If P1 rejects C1: you still approve → C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → tie → 50% you get 9 → expected 4.5 from 50% chance of C1, 50% of C2 (6) → total expected 0.5*9 + 0.5*6 = 7.5

But if you don’t approve C1, and only approve C2:
- C2 wins → you get 6 → **less than 7.5**

So you prefer to approve C1.

Now, what about C2?

If you approve C2, and C1 wins (if P1 approves C1), then C1 wins, and you get 9 anyway — so C2 approval doesn’t matter.

If P1 rejects C1, and you approve C2, then C1 and C2 tie — you are fine.

But if you **don’t approve C2**, and P1 rejects C1, then C1 has 1, C2 has 0 → C1 wins — you get 9.

But if you approve C2, and P1 rejects C1, then tie — 50% chance C2 — you get 6 if C2 wins.

But if you **don’t approve C2**, and P1 rejects C1, then C1 wins (because C2 has 0 approvals, C1 has 1) → you get 9.

So by **not approving C2**, you **maximize your payoff** when C1 has chance.

Only if **you believe that C1 cannot win**, then approving C2 might help — but no, because you should **always prefer C1**.

Moreover, **approving C2 has no benefit** — it doesn’t make C1 more likely to win.

In fact, it might **reduce** C1’s chance if P1 only approves C1 — then C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → tie → C1 wins 50% of the time.

But if you **don’t approve C2**, then C1 wins for sure if P1 approves.

So **you should neither approve C2 nor approve C1 if you’re unsure**.

But given that C1 dominates C2 for you, you should approve C1.

And **you should not approve C2** — because it only reduces your expected payoff (by introducing a chance of a worse outcome).

Therefore:

- Approve C1: YES → because it gives you 9
- Approve C2: NO → because it gives you at most 6, and adds risk

Final answer:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}
```

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

To maximize points in this game, it is necessary to analyze the payoff matrix and the influence of the rejected contract.

**Payoff Matrix:**
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

**Strategic Analysis:**
1.  **Nash Equilibria:** There are two Nash equilibria in this game: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) provides a higher payoff for both players (5 points each), it is riskier for Player 1.
2.  **Weak Dominance/Safety:** Action A1 is a "safe" move for both players. For Player 1, choosing A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of Player 2’s choice. Choosing A0, however, is a gamble: if Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 5 points, but if Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 0 points.
3.  **The Contract Influence:** Player 1 proposed a contract that would have penalized anyone choosing A1 if the other player chose A0, effectively making A0 a dominant strategy. Player 2 rejected this contract. This rejection is a strong signal that Player 2 does not feel comfortable committing to A0 or intends to play A1 without the risk of a penalty.
4.  **Risk Assessment:** To justify choosing A0, Player 1 must believe there is at least a 60% probability that Player 2 will choose A0 (since $5p > 3$, where $p$ is the probability of P2 choosing A0). Given that Player 2 rejected a contract that was designed to facilitate and protect the (A0, A0) outcome, it is highly probable that Player 2 will opt for the safety of A1.
5.  **Conclusion:** If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1’s best response is A1 to avoid receiving 0 points. Since A1 also guarantees Player 1 3 points (the same outcome they would get if Player 2 also played A1), it is the most rational choice given the suspicion signaled by Player 2's rejection of the contract.

Given the risk and the strong signal from Player 2, the safest and most likely optimal move for Player 1 is A1.

Here is the twist:

- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the payoff structure of the original game and compare it with the payoff structure after the contract is applied.

**1. Original Game Analysis:**
The payoff matrix for Player 1 (you) and Player 2 is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding 5 points each, and (A1, A1) yielding 3 points each. There is also a risk for Player 1: if they choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, Player 1 receives 0 points.

**2. Contract Analysis:**
The contract specifies:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

If both players sign, the payouts change as follows:
- **(A0, A0):** Player 1 receives 5 base points. Player 1 receives 4 points from Player 2 (for A0) but must pay Player 2 4 points (for Player 2’s A0). Net payoff: **(5, 5)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 receives 0 base points and receives 4 points from Player 2. Player 2 receives 3 base points and must pay 4 points. Net payoff: **(4, -1)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 receives 3 base points and must pay 4 points. Player 2 receives 0 base points and receives 4 points. Net payoff: **(-1, 4)**.
- **(A1, A1):** No additional payments. Net payoff: **(3, 3)**.

**3. Modified Game Dynamics:**
With the contract active, look at Player 1's incentives:
- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 5 points for A0 and -1 for A1. (A0 is better)
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 4 points for A0 and 3 for A1. (A0 is better)
Thus, A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players. This ensures the outcome (A0, A0), which results in the maximum possible payoff (5 points).

**4. Conclusion:**
Signing the contract turns a coordination game (where you might accidentally end up with 3 or 0 points) into a game where the optimal outcome (5 points) is driven by dominant strategies. Since the contract was proposed by you (Player 1) and specifically designed to secure the (A0, A0) outcome, signing it is the most rational decision to maximize your total points.

response:
To determine which contracts to approve, we need to analyze the effect of each contract on our points.

Let's first look at the payoffs without any contracts (baseline payoffs):

- If both choose A0: both players get 5 points.
- If you (Player 2) choose A0 and the other player (Player 1) chooses A1: you get 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: you get 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: both players get 3 points.

Next, let's analyze the proposed contracts:

### Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

#### Under this contract (C1):
- Both players choose A0: 
  - Payoff for Player 2: 5 (base) + 5 (additional) - 5 (drawn from Player 1) = 5 + 5 - 5 = 5.
  - Payoff for Player 1: 5 (base) + 5 (additional) - 5 (drawn from Player 2) = 5 + 5 - 5 = 5.
- Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Payoff for Player 2: 0 (base) + 5 (additional) - 5 (drawn from Player 1) = 0 + 5 - 0 = 0.
  - Payoff for Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 (additional) - 0 = 3.
- Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Payoff for Player 2: 3 (base) + 0 (additional) - 0 (no additional for A1) = 3.
  - Payoff for Player 1: 0 (base) + 5 (additional) - 5 (drawn from Player 2) = 0 + 5 - 3 = 2.
- Both choose A1:
  - Payoff for Player 2: 3 (base) + 0 (additional) - 0 (no additional for A1) = 3.
  - Payoff for Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 (additional) - 0 (no additional for A1) = 3.

This contract does not change incentives significantly, as the players still have the incentive to potentially mix strategies.

### Contract proposed by Player 2 (you):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

#### Under this contract (C2):
- Both players choose A0:
  - Payoff for Player 2: 5 (base) + 2 (additional) - 2 (drawn from Player 1) = 5 + 2 - 2 = 5.
  - Payoff for Player 1: 5 (base) + 2 (additional) - 2 (drawn from Player 2) = 5.
- Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Payoff for Player 2: 0 (base) + 2 (additional) - 2 (drawn from Player 1) = 0 + 2 = 2.
  - Payoff for Player 1: 3 (base) - 2 (penalty) = 1.
- Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Payoff for Player 2: 3 (base) - 2 (penalty) = 1.
  - Payoff for Player 1: 0 (base) + 2 (additional) - 2 = 0.
- Both choose A1:
  - Payoff for Player 2: 3 (base) - 2 (penalty) = 1.
  - Payoff for Player 1: 3 (base) - 2 (penalty) = 1.

This contract changes incentives significantly. Playing A0 becomes more attractive because of the reward and lower penalty compared to A1.

### Conclusion:
Given the incentive structures, approving the contract proposed by Player 2 is advantageous more often as it promotes mutual cooperation and harsher penalties for defection.

### Final Decision:
```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

Base payoff matrix (from my perspective as Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

Let me find the Nash equilibrium. If the other player plays A0 with probability p:
- My expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- My expected payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

I'm indifferent when 5p = 3, so p = 0.6

The mixed Nash equilibrium has both players playing A0 with probability 0.6, giving me an **expected payoff of 3**.

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- +4 points to whoever plays A0 (paid by the other player)
- 0 for whoever plays A1

New payoff matrix WITH contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 + 4 - 4 = 5 (I get bonus, pay bonus)
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 4 = 4 (I get bonus, pay nothing)
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 4 = -1 (I get nothing, pay bonus)
- (A1, A1): I get 3 (no bonuses)

Now checking best responses:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (get 5) over A1 (get -1)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (get 4) over A1 (get 3)

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy!** By symmetry, it's also dominant for the other player.

With the contract, we both play A0 with certainty, and I get **expected payoff of 5**.

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- Without contract: Expected payoff = 3
- With contract: Expected payoff = 5

The contract eliminates coordination risk and ensures we reach the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome.

**Decision: I should sign the contract.**

To determine the optimal strategy for this decision-making game, we must first analyze the final payoff matrix after incorporating the consequences of the payment contract.

### 1. Basic Payoff Matrix (You, Other Player)
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### 2. Incorporating the Contract
The contract specifies:
- Choosing A0: +4 points (taken from the other player).
- Choosing A1: 0 points (no transfer).

Let's recalculate the payoffs:
- **(A0, A0)**: Both players choose A0.
  - You receive 4 points from the other player but also give 4 points to the other player. Net change is 0.
  - Payoff: (5, 5).
- **(A0, A1)**: You choose A0, the other player chooses A1.
  - You receive 4 points from the other player. The other player gives 4 points (and receives 0).
  - Payoff: (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = (4, -1).
- **(A1, A0)**: You choose A1, the other player chooses A0.
  - You give 4 points to the other player. The other player receives 4 points.
  - Payoff: (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = (-1, 4).
- **(A1, A1)**: Both choose A1.
  - No points are transferred.
  - Payoff: (3, 3).

### 3. New Payoff Matrix
| | A0 (Other) | A1 (Other) |
|---|---|---|
| **A0 (You)** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **A1 (You)** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

### 4. Strategic Analysis
To maximize points, we look for dominant strategies:
- If the other player chooses **A0**: Comparing your options, A0 gives you 5 points, and A1 gives you -1 point. (5 > -1)
- If the other player chooses **A1**: Comparing your options, A0 gives you 4 points, and A1 gives you 3 points. (4 > 3)

In both scenarios, choosing **A0** results in a higher payoff than choosing A1. Therefore, A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy**. Furthermore, if both players act rationally and choose A0, they both receive 5 points, which is the highest possible payoff in the matrix (the socially optimal outcome).

There is no incentive to choose A1 under this contract, as it results in lower payoffs regardless of the other player's decision.

### Final Decision
Based on this analysis, the optimal strategy is to choose A0 with 100% probability.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
To determine the best strategy, we first analyze the base payoff matrix and then adjust it based on the payment contract. I am Player 2 (P2), and the other player is Player 1 (P1).

### 1. Base Payoff Matrix (P1, P2)
Based on the description:
- **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5 points $\rightarrow (5, 5)$
- **(P1=A1, P2=A0)**: "If you (P2) choose A0 and the other player (P1) chooses A1: you get 0, other gets 3" $\rightarrow (3, 0)$
- **(P1=A0, P2=A1)**: "If you (P2) choose A1 and the other player (P1) chooses A0: you get 3, other gets 0" $\rightarrow (0, 3)$
- **(P1=A1, P2=A1)**: Both get 3 points $\rightarrow (3, 3)$

### 2. Contract Adjustments
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."
- **(A0, A0)**: Both players choose A0. P1 gets +4 and loses 4; P2 gets +4 and loses 4. Net change is 0. $\rightarrow (5, 5)$
- **(P1=A1, P2=A0)**: P2 chooses A0, so P2 gets +4 from P1. Net: $P1 = 3 - 4 = -1$, $P2 = 0 + 4 = 4$. $\rightarrow (-1, 4)$
- **(P1=A0, P2=A1)**: P1 chooses A0, so P1 gets +4 from P2. Net: $P1 = 0 + 4 = 4$, $P2 = 3 - 4 = -1$. $\rightarrow (4, -1)$
- **(P1=A1, P2=A1)**: No one chooses A0. Net change is 0. $\rightarrow (3, 3)$

### 3. Adjusted Payoff Matrix (P1, P2)
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **P1: A1** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

### 4. Strategic Analysis
- **For Player 1**:
    - If P2 chooses A0, P1 gets 5 from A0 or -1 from A1. A0 is better.
    - If P2 chooses A1, P1 gets 4 from A0 or 3 from A1. A0 is better.
    - **A0 is a dominant strategy for P1.**
- **For Player 2 (Me)**:
    - If P1 chooses A0, P2 gets 5 from A0 or -1 from A1. A0 is better.
    - If P1 chooses A1, P2 gets 4 from A0 or 3 from A1. A0 is better.
    - **A0 is a dominant strategy for P2.**

The contract successfully turns a game that previously had two Nash equilibria (A0, A0 and A1, A1) into a game where A0 is the strictly dominant strategy for both players. Choosing A0 maximizes the expected points regardless of the other player's decision.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the payoff matrices of the original game and the game with the contract in place.

### Original Payoff Matrix
The original payoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) are:
- **(A0, A0):** (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** (0, 3)
- **(A1, A0):** (3, 0)
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)

In this version, there are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) with 5 points each and (A1, A1) with 3 points each. However, (A0, A0) is risky; if Player 1 chooses A0 expecting Player 2 to do the same, but Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 ends up with 0 points.

### Contract Impact
The proposed contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payment is made.

If both players sign the contract, the new payoffs are calculated as follows:
- **(A0, A0):** 
    - Player 1: 5 (base) + 4 (for A0) - 4 (to Player 2) = 5
    - Player 2: 5 (base) + 4 (for A0) - 4 (to Player 1) = 5
- **(A0, A1):** 
    - Player 1: 0 (base) + 4 (for A0) = 4
    - Player 2: 3 (base) - 4 (to Player 1) = -1
- **(A1, A0):** 
    - Player 1: 3 (base) - 4 (to Player 2) = -1
    - Player 2: 0 (base) + 4 (for A0) = 4
- **(A1, A1):** 
    - Player 1: 3
    - Player 2: 3

### Revised Payoff Matrix (with Contract)
- **(A0, A0):** (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** (4, -1)
- **(A1, A0):** (-1, 4)
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)

### Analysis of the Contract
Under the contract, A0 becomes a **dominant strategy** for both players:
- If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 5 points with A0 vs -1 point with A1.
- If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 4 points with A0 vs 3 points with A1.

By signing the contract, you eliminate the risk of the (0, 3) and (3, 3) outcomes and turn the game into one where A0 is always the best move, leading both players to the optimal (5, 5) outcome. Since Player 1 proposed this contract, it is clearly intended to stabilize the cooperative result and maximize points.

To determine the best strategy, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and then calculate the modified payoffs after including the effects of the payment contract.

**Original Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Contract Details:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points and the other player loses 4 points.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no transfer.

**Modified Payoffs with Contract:**
1.  **Both choose A0:**
    - Player 1: 5 (original) + 4 (for choosing A0) - 4 (taken by P2 for choosing A0) = 5
    - Player 2: 5 (original) + 4 (for choosing A0) - 4 (taken by P1 for choosing A0) = 5
    - Result: (5, 5)
2.  **Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:**
    - Player 1: 0 (original) + 4 (for choosing A0) - 0 (no transfer from P2) = 4
    - Player 2: 3 (original) + 0 (for choosing A1) - 4 (taken by P1 for choosing A0) = -1
    - Result: (4, -1)
3.  **Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:**
    - Player 1: 3 (original) + 0 (for choosing A1) - 4 (taken by P2 for choosing A0) = -1
    - Player 2: 0 (original) + 4 (for choosing A0) - 0 (no transfer from P1) = 4
    - Result: (-1, 4)
4.  **Both choose A1:**
    - Player 1: 3 (original) + 0 = 3
    - Player 2: 3 (original) + 0 = 3
    - Result: (3, 3)

**Strategy Analysis:**
- **Player 1's Dominant Strategy:** 
    - If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 5 points by choosing A0 and -1 point by choosing A1.
    - If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 4 points by choosing A0 and 3 points by choosing A1.
    In both scenarios, A0 yields a higher payoff for Player 1.
- **Player 2's Dominant Strategy:**
    - Because the matrix is symmetric, Player 2 also has a dominant strategy to choose A0 (5 > -1 and 4 > 3).

Both players are incentivized to choose A0 to maximize their individual points and ensure they don't lose points to the other player. This results in the Nash Equilibrium (A0, A0), which also happens to provide the highest total points for both players (5, 5).

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Please ONLY provide the output to the above question.

To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the game step by step, incorporating the payoff description and the effects of the contract.

### 1. Identify the Players and Basic Actions
- **You (Player 2):** Actions A0, A1
- **Other Player (Player 1):** Actions A0, A1

### 2. Determine Original Payoffs (P1, P2)
Based on the payoff description:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 $\rightarrow$ (5, 5)
- (P2 chooses A0, P1 chooses A1): P2 gets 0, P1 gets 3 $\rightarrow$ (3, 0)
- (P2 chooses A1, P1 chooses A0): P2 gets 3, P1 gets 0 $\rightarrow$ (0, 3)
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 $\rightarrow$ (3, 3)

### 3. Apply the Twist (The Contract)
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payment occurs.

**Adjusted Calculations:**
- **Outcome (A0, A0):**
  - Player 2 gets 5 (base) + 5 (from choosing A0) - 5 (Player 1 chose A0) = 5
  - Player 1 gets 5 (base) + 5 (from choosing A0) - 5 (Player 2 chose A0) = 5
  - **Final: (5, 5)**

- **Outcome (P1: A1, P2: A0):**
  - Player 2 gets 0 (base) + 5 (from choosing A0) - 0 (Player 1 chose A1) = 5
  - Player 1 gets 3 (base) + 0 (from choosing A1) - 5 (Player 2 chose A0) = -2
  - **Final: (3 - 5, 0 + 5) = (-2, 5)**

- **Outcome (P1: A0, P2: A1):**
  - Player 2 gets 3 (base) + 0 (from choosing A1) - 5 (Player 1 chose A0) = -2
  - Player 1 gets 0 (base) + 5 (from choosing A0) - 0 (Player 2 chose A1) = 5
  - **Final: (0 + 5, 3 - 5) = (5, -2)**

- **Outcome (A1, A1):**
  - No contract adjustment.
  - **Final: (3, 3)**

### 4. Create the Final Payoff Matrix (P1, P2)
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---:|:---:|:---:|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (5, -2) |
| **P1: A1** | (-2, 5) | (3, 3) |

### 5. Strategy Analysis
From your perspective as Player 2:
- If Player 1 chooses **A0**, choosing **A0** gives you **5** points, while choosing **A1** gives you **-2**.
- If Player 1 chooses **A1**, choosing **A0** gives you **5** points, while choosing **A1** gives you **3**.

Action **A0** is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2, as it yields the highest payoff regardless of what Player 1 chooses. Conversely, Player 1 also finds **A0** to be a dominant strategy. In a game with rational players aiming to maximize points, both will choose **A0**.

### 6. Final Decision
Since A0 is the dominant action, the strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoff matrix with the contract

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0: they get +4 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1: no payment

Let me calculate all four scenarios (My action, Opponent's action):

**Case 1: (A0, A0)**
- Base payoff: I get 5
- I chose A0: I get +4 (from opponent)
- Opponent chose A0: I pay -4 (to opponent)
- **My total: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5**

**Case 2: (A0, A1)**
- Base payoff: I get 0
- I chose A0: I get +4 (from opponent)
- Opponent chose A1: no contract effect
- **My total: 0 + 4 = 4**

**Case 3: (A1, A0)**
- Base payoff: I get 3
- I chose A1: no contract effect
- Opponent chose A0: I pay -4 (to opponent)
- **My total: 3 - 4 = -1**

**Case 4: (A1, A1)**
- Base payoff: I get 3
- No contract effects
- **My total: 3**

## Step 2: Determine optimal strategy

Modified payoff matrix (my payoffs):
- If opponent plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1
- If opponent plays A1: A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3

Let the opponent play A0 with probability p and A1 with probability (1-p).

**Expected payoff for A0:** 5p + 4(1-p) = p + 4

**Expected payoff for A1:** -1p + 3(1-p) = 3 - 4p

Comparing: A0 is better when p + 4 > 3 - 4p
- This gives: 5p > -1, or p > -0.2

Since p ∈ [0,1], this inequality is **always true**.

## Step 3: Conclusion

**A0 strictly dominates A1** regardless of what the opponent does. The contract transformed the game such that choosing A0 is always optimal.

Therefore, I should play A0 with 100% probability.

response:
To determine the best strategy for Player 1, we first need to re-evaluate the payoff matrix by incorporating the effects of the contract.

### Initial Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
*   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 3)
*   (A1, A0): (3, 0)
*   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### Contract Details:
*   If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points, and the other player loses 4 points.
*   If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

### Adjusted Payoff Matrix:
1.  **(A0, A0):**
    *   Player 1 chooses A0: +4 from Player 2, -4 from Player 2 (because Player 2 also chose A0). Net change: 0.
    *   Player 2 chooses A0: +4 from Player 1, -4 from Player 1 (because Player 1 also chose A0). Net change: 0.
    *   **Final Payoff: (5, 5)**

2.  **(A0, A1):**
    *   Player 1 chooses A0: +4 from Player 2.
    *   Player 2 chooses A1: No payment received, but pays 4 to Player 1.
    *   **Final Payoff: (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = (4, -1)**

3.  **(A1, A0):**
    *   Player 1 chooses A1: No payment received, but pays 4 to Player 2.
    *   Player 2 chooses A0: +4 from Player 1.
    *   **Final Payoff: (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = (-1, 4)**

4.  **(A1, A1):**
    *   Neither player chooses A0: No payments.
    *   **Final Payoff: (3, 3)**

### Decision Analysis for Player 1:
*   If Player 2 chooses **A0**: Player 1 gets **5** points by choosing A0 and **-1** point by choosing A1. (A0 is better)
*   If Player 2 chooses **A1**: Player 1 gets **4** points by choosing A0 and **3** points by choosing A1. (A0 is better)

In both possible scenarios, choosing **A0** results in a higher payoff for Player 1. Consequently, A0 is a strictly dominant strategy. Furthermore, since the game is symmetric, A0 is also the dominant strategy for Player 2. If both players act rationally to maximize their own total points, they will both choose A0, resulting in a payoff of 5 points each.

### Strategy:
Since A0 is the dominant strategy, Player 1 should commit 100% of their probability to A0.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

The game is a simultaneous move game with two players. Each chooses between A0 or A1.

The payoff matrix (from the perspective of Player 2) is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0         | A1         |
|----------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**               | 5, 5       | 0, 3       |
| **A1**               | 3, 0       | 3, 3       |

So:
- (A0, A0): (5,5)
- (A0, A1): (0,3)
- (A1, A0): (3,0)
- (A1, A1): (3,3)

This is **not** a standard prisoner’s dilemma, but it has some similarities.

Let’s determine the best responses.

#### Player 2’s Best Response:
- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - Player 2 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → **A0** is better.
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - Player 2 gets 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → **A1** is better.

So Player 2’s best response depends on Player 1’s choice.

#### Nash Equilibrium?
Let’s look for pure strategy equilibria:

- (A0, A0): Player 1 gets 5; if Player 1 deviates to A1, gets 3 → worse. Player 2: if deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no incentive. So (A0, A0) **is a Nash equilibrium**.
- (A1, A1): Player 1 gets 3; if deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3 → no. Player 2: deviating to A0 → gets 0 < 3 → no. So (A1, A1) **is also a Nash equilibrium**.
- (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 3. If Player 2 deviates to A1 → gets 3, same. But Player 1 gets 3 if they play A1; if they switch to A0, they get 5 > 3 → so Player 1 wants to deviate. Not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 0, wants to deviate to A0 → gets 5. So not equilibrium.

So two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

There may also be a mixed strategy equilibrium, but let’s see what happens with the contract.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

The contract says:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other players.

So:
- If **you** choose A0, you get +4 points.
- The **other player** loses 4 points (since the 4 points are "drawn equally from the other players" — and since only one other player, they lose 4).
- If you choose A1: no additional payment.

So the **contract modifies the payoffs** **only when you play A0**, adding +4 to your payoff and subtracting 4 from the opponent’s.

Important: The contract is **only active if both players sign it**. So the contract is **only in effect if you say “yes”** and Player 1 also agrees (which they did by proposing it via approval voting — so they signed, presumably).

But **you** must decide whether to sign.

So:
- If **you do not sign**, contract is not active → game is base game.
- If **you sign**, contract is active → payoffs are modified as above.

We must consider: **Is it in your interest to sign the contract, assuming Player 1 has already signed?**

Remember: You are Player 2.

So the contract affects:
- Your payoff when you play A0: +4
- Player 1’s payoff when you play A0: -4

When you play A1: no change.

---

### Step 3: Rewrite Payoffs with Contract Active

Let’s rewrite the game with the contract in effect (i.e., both signed).

New payoffs (from Player 2’s perspective):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0        | A1        |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0** (with +4)     | 5+4=9, 5-4=1 | 0+4=4, 3-4= -1 |
| **A1**               | 3, 0        | 3, 3        |

Details:
- If you play A0, you get +4, opponent loses 4.
- So:
  - (A0, A0): you get 5+4=9; opponent gets 5-4=1
  - (A0, A1): you get 0+4=4; opponent gets 3-4=-1
  - (A1, A0): you get 3, opponent gets 0
  - (A1, A1): you get 3, opponent gets 3

Now, analyze this new game *with the contract in place*.

---

### Step 4: Analyze Player 2’s Incentives with Contract Active

Player 2 wants to maximize their payoff.

Let’s look at best responses.

#### If Player 1 plays A0:
- Player 2: A0 → 9, A1 → 3 → best to play **A0**

#### If Player 1 plays A1:
- Player 2: A0 → 4, A1 → 3 → best to play **A0**

So **no matter what Player 1 does, Player 2’s best response is A0**.

So **A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 2** when the contract is active.

That means, if you sign the contract, you should play A0 no matter what.

Player 1, meanwhile, may still play A0 or A1 depending on their incentives.

But since you are deciding whether to sign, you should ask: **Is it better for me to sign the contract?**

We need to compare:
- Your expected payoff **if you do NOT sign** (so game is original)
- Your expected payoff **if you DO sign** (so game is modified, and you play optimally)

But we must consider how Player 1 will play, and whether the contract changes their incentives.

Let’s analyze.

---

### Step 5: Predict Player 1's Behavior — With Contract

Player 1’s payoff **changes** only when **you (Player 2) play A0**, because only then do they lose 4 points.

So:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → Player 1 gets 1 (if they play A0) or -1 (if they play A1)
- If Player 2 plays A1 → no change → Player 1 gets 0 for A0, 3 for A1

Player 1’s payoffs (from their view):

With contract active:

| P1 \ P2 | A0         | A1         |
|---------|------------|------------|
| A0      | 1 (5-4)    | 0          |
| A1      | -1 (3-4)   | 3          |

So:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1: A0 → 1, A1 → -1 → so plays A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1: A0 → 0, A1 → 3 → so plays A1

But from above, we know that **you (Player 2)** will play A0 regardless, because it’s dominant.

So **Player 1 should expect you to play A0**.

Therefore, Player 1 will play A0 → payoff 1, instead of A1 (payoff -1)

So with contract active:
- You play A0
- Player 1 plays A0
- Final outcome: (A0, A0)
- Your payoff: 9

---

### Step 6: Compare to Not Signing

If you **do not** sign the contract, then the base game applies.

The game has two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Which one will be played?

But the contract was **proposed by Player 1**, who will not sign unless they believe they benefit.

So **Player 1** will only sign if they believe they benefit.

But you’re deciding whether to sign, and you care about your **own payoff**, assuming Player 1 has already signed (since the contract was approved).

Wait: the contract is only active if **all players sign**.

So if you **don’t sign**, contract is **not active**, no matter what Player 1 does.

So to analyze, we must compare:
- Your expected payoff if you **sign** → contract active → you get 9 (from A0,A0, as above)
- Your expected payoff if you **don’t sign** → base game

But in the base game, what will happen?

We must consider **what outcome is likely** in the base game.

In base game:
- Pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)
- (A0,A0) is more "efficient" (total 10 vs 6)
- But both are equilibria.

But which one will be played?

Player 1, who proposed the contract, likely wants to **prevent** a bad outcome.

In base game:
- If both play A0: you get 5
- If both play A1: you get 3
- So Player 1 prefers (A0,A0) over (A1,A1)

But **you** (Player 2) get 5 in (A0,A0), 3 in (A1,A1)

So in **both** equilibria, you get **more** than the other equilibrium.

But Player 1 proposed the contract, so they must believe that either:
- They are doing better with the contract, or
- They have a preference

But the contract **only applies if both sign**.

Now, **if you don't sign**, contract is off → base game.

So let’s suppose you don’t sign → base game.

What happens?

You are Player 2.

What will you do?

Best response:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → you prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If Player 1 plays A1 → you prefer A1 (3 > 0)

So it depends on beliefs.

But in the absence of coordination, multiple outcomes.

So **if you don’t sign**, the game is base game, and you face uncertainty.

But since you are trying to **maximize expected points**, you should consider the **most likely equilibria**.

Note that (A0,A0) is **Pareto superior** (total payoff 10) vs (A1,A1) (total 6).

Also: both players get more in (A0,A0) than in (A1,A1).

So (A0,A0) is a **strong candidate for focal point** — especially since it’s the first coordination outcome.

Moreover, Player 1 proposed a contract — implying they want to **coordinate on A0**, perhaps.

Therefore, it is **reasonable to expect** that if no contract is in place, the players might **still coordinate** on (A0,A0), especially if they can communicate or think strategically.

In many such games (coordination games), (A0,A0) is the expected outcome.

So **without contract**, you expect (A0,A0) → you get 5.

But **with contract**, you get 9.

Is there a risk?

Suppose (A0,A0) is not reached if you don’t sign.

Suppose instead they play (A1,A1) — then you get 3.

But (A0,A0) is more likely to be selected due to efficiency and dominance.

But let’s suppose **you don’t sign** — base game — and the only equilibria are (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

To maximize your **minimum** payoff, you might worry about (A1,A1) — but you have no way to force coordination.

However, in the absence of a contract, if both players are rational and know each other are rational, they could converge on (A0,A0) via backward induction or focal point.

But there’s no strict dominance (for you), only mixed best responses.

But let’s suppose you **don’t sign** → you might get 5 (if (A0,A0)) or 3 (if (A1,A1)).

Expected payoff depends on beliefs.

But **with the contract**, you **know** you will get 9 — because you can play A0 (dominant), and Player 1 will respond with A0 (since they get 1 vs -1).

So:

- **If you sign**: you get **9**
- **If you do not sign**: you get **at best 5** (in (A0,A0)), **at worst 3**

Even **if** (A0,A0) is the only possible outcome in base game, you get 5 — **less than 9**

So **signing leads to higher payoff**

But wait: does the contract **force coordination on A0**?

Yes — because after signing, A0 becomes dominant for you, and Player 1 then plays A0 in response.

So (A0,A0) is guaranteed.

So your payoff is **9**, guaranteed.

Without contract, you get at most 5.

Hence, **signing is clearly better**

But is there a risk?

One concern: what if Player 1 changes their mind? But the contract was approved via voting — so Player 1 **has already said yes**. They want the contract.

So if you sign, it’s active.

If you don’t sign, it’s off — base game.

So **by signing, you get 9**.

**By not signing**, you get at most 5, possibly less.

Even if you believe that (A0,A0) is the only outcome, 5 < 9.

So **signing is better in expectation**.

Also: the contract **aligns incentives** so that you dominate A0, and Player 1 cannot do better than A0.

Is there any downside?

Only if you misjudged Player 1’s play.

But in this case, they are **expected** to play A0 when you play A0 — because they get 1 (vs -1)

So no issue.

Therefore, **signing the contract gives you a guaranteed 9 points.**

Not signing gives you at most 5.

So **you should sign**.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

As Player 2, my payoff matrix is:
```
               P1: A0    P1: A1
Me (P2): A0    (5, 5)    (0, 3)
Me (P2): A1    (3, 0)    (3, 3)
```

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving (5,5) and (A1, A1) giving (3,3).

The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium has both players playing A0 with probability 3/5, yielding an expected payoff of **3 points** for each player.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Under C1, if a player chooses A0, they get +5 from the other player:

```
               P1: A0         P1: A1
Me (P2): A0    (5, 5)         (5, -2)
Me (P2): A1    (-2, 5)        (3, 3)
```

Analysis:
- For me: A0 gives 5 regardless of P1's choice; A1 gives -2 or 3. **A0 dominates A1**.
- For P1: A0 gives 5 regardless of my choice; A1 gives -2 or 3. **A0 dominates A1**.

**Nash Equilibrium under C1: (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5)**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Under C2, if a player chooses A1, they pay 4 to the other player:

```
               P1: A0         P1: A1
Me (P2): A0    (5, 5)         (4, -1)
Me (P2): A1    (-1, 4)        (3, 3)
```

Analysis:
- For me: A0 gives 5 or 4; A1 gives -1 or 3. **A0 dominates A1**.
- For P1: A0 gives 5 or 4; A1 gives -1 or 3. **A0 dominates A1**.

**Nash Equilibrium under C2: (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5)**

## Step 4: Compare Outcomes

- **No contract**: Expected payoff = 3 points
- **Contract 1**: Payoff = 5 points
- **Contract 2**: Payoff = 5 points

Both contracts make A0 a dominant strategy for both players, ensuring we reach the efficient outcome (A0, A0) with 5 points each. This is significantly better than the 3 points I'd expect in the base game's mixed strategy equilibrium.

## Conclusion

Both contracts improve my payoff from 3 to 5 points. I should approve both.

response:
Both proposed contracts are identical, so my approvals can only affect **which identical contract label** is selected, not the incentives or outcomes.

Let’s compute the modified payoffs (additional payments are transfers between players):

- **(A0, A0):** each gets +2 from the other ⇒ net 0 transfer ⇒ payoff stays **5**
- **(A0, A1):** I get +2 (other pays 2) ⇒ **0 + 2 = 2**
- **(A1, A0):** I pay 2 ⇒ **3 − 2 = 1**
- **(A1, A1):** both pay 2 to the other ⇒ net 0 ⇒ payoff stays **3**

So my payoff matrix becomes:

- (A0,A0)=5, (A0,A1)=2  
- (A1,A0)=1, (A1,A1)=3

Since **C1 and C2 are the same contract**, approving or rejecting doesn’t change the substance—only the label that might be randomly picked. I’ll approve both.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 1, let's analyze the payoff matrix after incorporating the payment contract.

### Initial Payoff Matrix (P1, P2):
- **(A0, A0):** (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** (0, 3)
- **(A1, A0):** (3, 0)
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)

### The Contract:
- If a player chooses **A0**, they receive +4 points, and the other player loses 4 points.
- If a player chooses **A1**, there is no additional payment.

### Adjusted Payoff Matrix:
Let's calculate the net payoff for each scenario based on the contract:

1.  **(A0, A0):**
    - P1 receives +4 for choosing A0 and loses 4 for P2 choosing A0. Total change: 0.
    - P2 receives +4 for choosing A0 and loses 4 for P1 choosing A0. Total change: 0.
    - **Net Payoff: (5, 5)**

2.  **(A0, A1):**
    - P1 receives +4 for choosing A0.
    - P2 loses 4 for P1 choosing A0.
    - **Net Payoff: (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = (4, -1)**

3.  **(A1, A0):**
    - P1 loses 4 for P2 choosing A0.
    - P2 receives +4 for choosing A0.
    - **Net Payoff: (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = (-1, 4)**

4.  **(A1, A1):**
    - No additional payments because neither chose A0.
    - **Net Payoff: (3, 3)**

### Strategy Analysis:
Now we analyze the final matrix:
- **If Player 2 chooses A0:** Player 1 gets **5 points** if they choose A0, and **-1 point** if they choose A1.
- **If Player 2 chooses A1:** Player 1 gets **4 points** if they choose A0, and **3 points** if they choose A1.

In both cases, choosing **A0** results in a higher payoff for Player 1 than choosing A1 (5 > -1 and 4 > 3). Therefore, **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy** for Player 1.

The same logic applies to Player 2 (the matrix is symmetric):
- **If Player 1 chooses A0:** Player 2 gets 5 for A0 and -1 for A1.
- **If Player 1 chooses A1:** Player 2 gets 4 for A0 and 3 for A1.
A0 is also a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2.

In game theory, if a strategy is strictly dominant, a rational player will always choose it. Both players choosing A0 leads to the Nash Equilibrium of (5, 5).

### Final Action Probabilities:
Since A0 is a strictly dominant strategy, Player 1 should assign 100% probability to A0.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!


Instruction:

- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

response:
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game without the contract

The original payoff matrix (Player 2’s perspective, since we are Player 2) is:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                        | 5        | 0        |
| **A1**                        | 3        | 3        |

So, from Player 2’s perspective (you):

- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → you get **5**
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get **0**
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get **3**
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → you get **3**

This is a coordination game with a twist: A0 gives higher payoff *only if* the opponent also plays A0. Otherwise, A0 is very bad.

---

### Step 2: Now add the contract

The **contract** says:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, **drawn equally from the other players**.

Important points:
- The **additional 4 points** are *added* to your payoff **if you choose A0**.
- The 4 points are **drawn from the other player(s)** — meaning the opponent loses 4 points **if you choose A0**.

So, for **you (Player 2)**:
- If you play A0 → you get **+4** extra points
- If opponent plays A0 → they pay you 4 points → they lose 4 points

But **only the player who chooses A0** gets the +4 bonus and causes the opponent to lose 4.

So the **total payoff structure changes**.

We must now compute the **new payoff matrix** from **your perspective (Player 2)**, incorporating this contract.

---

### Step 3: Update the payoff matrix with the contract

Let’s recompute the payoffs considering the contract.

Recall:  
- The original payoffs (from the rules) are modified by the contract.
- The contract adds +4 points to **you** if **you** play A0.
- The contract deducts 4 points from the **opponent** if **you** play A0.

But **only you** get the +4 if you choose A0. The opponent only suffers a loss of 4 if *you* choose A0.

So now, your payoff in each outcome is:

#### Case 1: You → A0, Opponent → A0
- Original: You get 5
- You chose A0 → you get **+4** → total = 5 + 4 = **9**
- Opponent chose A0 → they paid 4 → their original payoff would have been 5, but now:
  - They get 5 − 4 = 1 (but we don’t care about their payoff, only yours)
- So **your payoff = 9**

#### Case 2: You → A0, Opponent → A1
- Original: You get 0
- You chose A0 → you get **+4** → total = 0 + 4 = **4**
- Opponent chose A1 → no penalty → they keep original 3 (but irrelevant)
- So **your payoff = 4**

#### Case 3: You → A1, Opponent → A0
- Original: You get 3
- You chose A1 → **no bonus**
- Opponent chose A0 → they paid 4, but since you didn’t choose A0, **you don’t get the bonus**
- So your payoff remains **3**
- (Note: the contract only gives you the bonus if you play A0)

#### Case 4: You → A1, Opponent → A1
- Original: You get 3
- You chose A1 → no bonus
- Opponent chose A1 → no penalty
- So your payoff remains **3**

So, updated payoff matrix (your perspective):

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                        | 9        | 4        |
| **A1**                        | 3        | 3        |

This is **critical**.

Now, note that **A0 is always better for you than A1** in every case:
- If opponent plays A0: 9 vs 3 → A0 is better
- If opponent plays A1: 4 vs 3 → A0 is better

So, **A0 dominates A1** for you now.

That means you should **always play A0**, regardless of what the opponent does.

But wait — is that really the case? Let’s verify.

Yes: for every possible action of the opponent, A0 gives you strictly higher payoff than A1.

- Against A0: 9 > 3
- Against A1: 4 > 3

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** in terms of payoff for you.

Thus, you should **always choose A0**.

Therefore, your optimal strategy is to set:
- A0: 100%
- A1: 0%

But wait — what about the **opponent’s strategy**? Do they affect this?

No — because regardless of what they do, A0 gives you a higher payoff.

Even if they play A1 with certainty, you still get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1.

So **no rational player should ever play A1** in this game from your perspective.

---

### Step 4: But is there any trick?

Let’s consider the **contract effect on the opponent**.

The contract penalizes the opponent **if you play A0**. That might influence their decision — but **you are not trying to predict their strategy** — you are trying to **maximize your own payoff**.

Your goal is **not to minimize their payoff**, but to maximize your **own** payoff.

And since A0 gives you a higher payoff no matter what they do, **A0 is best for you regardless of their strategy**.

Thus, playing A0 with 100% probability is **dominant**.

---

### Step 5: Final decision

You **must** choose a probability distribution. Since A0 strictly dominates A1, the optimal strategy is to play A0 with probability 100%.

So:
- A0: 100
- A1: 0

Sum is 100 — valid.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

response:
To determine the approvals for each proposed contract, we first need to understand how each contract affects the payoffs and then decide if it benefits us as Player 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Basic Payoff Matrix:
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

#### Proposed Contracts:
- **Contract proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 (C1 and C2)**: 
    - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
    - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Let's rewrite the payoff matrix considering the proposed contract terms:

#### With Proposed Contract:
Increase payoff for A0 by 2 points and decrease payoff for A1 by 2 points.

##### New Payoff Matrix:
- **Both choose A0:**
  - Each player gets: 5 (basic) + 2 (additional) = 7 points.
- **You choose A0, other player chooses A1:**
  - You get: 0 (basic) + 2 (additional) = 2 points.
  - Other player gets: 3 (basic) - 2 (penalty) = 1 point.
- **You choose A1, other player chooses A0:**
  - You get: 3 (basic) - 2 (penalty) = 1 point.
  - Other player gets: 0 (basic) + 2 (additional) = 2 points.
- **Both choose A1:**
  - Each player gets: 3 (basic) - 2 (penalty) = 1 point.

##### Analysis:
1. **Choosing A0:**
   - If the other player also chooses A0: you both maximize points with 7 points each.
   - If the other player chooses A1: you still get 2 points (better than 0 without the contract).
   
2. **Choosing A1:**
   - If the other player also chooses A1: you both end up with 1 point.
   - If the other player chooses A0: you get only 1 point (worse compared to the other combinations).

This transformed game strongly incentivizes choosing A0 for both players as it maximizes joint payoff and individual payoff better than choosing A1.

Since the contract encourages cooperation and results in a higher payoff for choosing A0, it aligns with our goal of maximizing total points.

### Conclusion:
- Contract 1 and Contract 2 are essentially the same.
- Both contracts significantly improve the outcomes when both players cooperate by choosing A0.

#### Decision
Given that both contracts improve the overall payoffs and drive the players toward cooperation, we should approve both.

### Output:
```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": true
}
```

This ensures that we maximize the opportunities for higher payoffs regardless of which contract gets chosen in the game.

agent: openai/gpt-5.2(CoT)#P1
response:
Both proposed contracts change incentives by creating transfers between players based on actions.

### Step 1: Compute my payoffs under each contract

Because there are 2 players, “drawn equally from the other players” means any bonus to one player is paid entirely by the other (a pure transfer).

#### Contract C1
- If I play **A0**: I get **+2** from the other player.
- If I play **A1**: I pay **2** to the other player (**-2** for me).
Also, I may have to pay/receive depending on what the *other* player does.

My net payoffs:

- (A0, A0): base 5 +2 −2 = **5**
- (A0, A1): base 0 +2 +2 = **4**
- (A1, A0): base 3 −2 −2 = **−1**
- (A1, A1): base 3 −2 +2 = **3**

So against either opponent action, **A0 strictly dominates A1** (5 > −1 and 4 > 3). This makes (A0, A0) the clear outcome.

#### Contract C2
- If I play **A0**: I get **+4** from the other player.
- If I play **A1**: no transfer.
Again include what happens when the other player chooses A0 (I then pay them 4).

My net payoffs:

- (A0, A0): base 5 +4 −4 = **5**
- (A0, A1): base 0 +4 = **4**
- (A1, A0): base 3 −4 = **−1**
- (A1, A1): base 3 = **3**

This is the *same* payoff matrix as C1, hence again **A0 strictly dominates**.

### Step 2: Voting decision
Since **both contracts are equally good for me** (they induce the same incentives and outcome) and both are better than having no contract (which risks ending up at the lower-payoff outcome), I should **approve both** to maximize the chance that some contract is selected.

### Step 1: Understand the base game incentives
Payoffs (Player 1 first):

- (A0, A0) = (5, 5)  
- (A0, A1) = (0, 3)  
- (A1, A0) = (3, 0)  
- (A1, A1) = (3, 3)

There are two pure equilibria: **(A0,A0)** (better) and **(A1,A1)** (worse).

---

### Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (Player 1’s proposal)
C1: choosing **A0** gives you **+2** (taken from the other player); choosing **A1** makes you **pay 2** to the other.

With 2 players, this is a direct transfer between players.

Adjusted outcomes for Player 1:

- (A0, A0): still **5** (both transfer equally; net 0)
- (A0, A1): **0 + 2 = 2**
- (A1, A0): **3 − 2 = 1**
- (A1, A1): still **3** (net 0)

So C1 still has **two equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1). It improves the “temptation” structure somewhat, but does **not** eliminate the bad equilibrium (A1,A1) with payoff 3.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (Player 2’s proposal)
C2: choosing **A0** gives you **+4** taken from the other player; choosing **A1** has **no transfer**.

Adjusted outcomes for Player 1:

- (A0, A0): still **5** (equal transfers; net 0)
- (A0, A1): **0 + 4 = 4**
- (A1, A0): **3 − 4 = -1**
- (A1, A1): still **3**

Now compare Player 1’s action incentives:

- If Player 2 plays A0: A0 gives **5**, A1 gives **-1** → prefer **A0**
- If Player 2 plays A1: A0 gives **4**, A1 gives **3** → still prefer **A0**

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** under C2, meaning the unique equilibrium is **(A0, A0)** with payoff **5**.

C2 is therefore the strongest contract for maximizing your expected payoff.

---

### Step 4: Approval strategy
Approving C1 can only *reduce* the chance C2 is selected (because ties among max-approved contracts are broken uniformly at random). Since C2 is strictly better from a strategic stability perspective (forces (A0,A0)), the best voting tactic is:

- **Approve C2**
- **Do not approve C1**

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's break down the scenario into steps and analyze the outcomes.

### Step 1: Understand the Basic Payoff Matrix Without Contract
Let's first look at the payoffs for each combination of choices without any contracts:
- If both choose A0: Both get 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: Both get 3 points.

### Step 2: Understand the Payoff Matrix With the Contract
If the contract is signed, the payoffs for each action combination will change due to the added payments:
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: Both get 5 points from the basic game and an additional 5 points (10 points each), but they have to pay 5 points to each other for choosing A0, so both retain 5 points. This is essentially unchanged from the basic game.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points from the basic game, but 5 points from the contract (total 5 points). Player 1 gets 3 points but pays 5 points (net loss of 2 points), so Player 1 ends up with -2 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points from the basic game, minus 5 points to Player 1 (total: -2 points). Player 1 gets 0 points from the basic game, plus 5 points (total: 5 points).
- If both choose A1: Both get 3 points, and no additional payment. So, both retain 3 points.

### Step 3: Compare Expected Outcomes
Next, we need to compare the possible payoffs with and without the contract to understand if it's beneficial to sign.

- Without the contract:
  - A0 vs A0: 5 points each
  - A0 vs A1: 0, 3 points
  - A1 vs A0: 3, 0 points
  - A1 vs A1: 3 points each

- With the contract:
  - A0 vs A0: 5 points each (no net change)
  - A0 vs A1: 5, -2 points
  - A1 vs A0: -2, 5 points
  - A1 vs A1: 3 points each (no net change)

### Step 4: Evaluate Decision
If the contract is signed, the dynamics change in the following way:
- Choosing A0 yourself guarantees you at least 5 points (if the other player chooses A0) or still leaves you positive if the other player chooses A1.
- Choosing A1 could result in a loss or lower gain if Player 1 decides to pick A0.

From Player 2's perspective, signing the contract:
- Incentivizes others (Player 1) to pick A0, which would also push Player 2 to pick A0 to maximize points.
- Essentially converts the game into a mutual agreement of picking A0, guaranteeing a payoff of 5 points each.

Since signing the contract guarantees a better predictable outcome, and the losses for deviating under the contract are less severe, it is beneficial to sign the contract.

### Final Decision
Given the better predictability and higher payoffs on average, Player 2 should sign the contract.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs

From my perspective (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Analyze the original game without contract

In the base game:
- If opponent plays A0, I prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If opponent plays A1, I prefer A1 (3 > 0)

This creates two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5 points each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 points each. There's a coordination problem - we might not end up at the better equilibrium.

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract penalizes A1 by -4 points (paid to the other player).

New payoffs for me (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): 5 + 0 = **5** (no one pays)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 4 = **4** (opponent pays me 4)
- (A1, A0): 3 - 4 = **-1** (I pay opponent 4)
- (A1, A1): 3 - 4 + 4 = **3** (we both pay each other 4)

## Step 4: Analyze strategic incentives with contract

With the contract:
- If opponent plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → **A0 is better**
- If opponent plays A1: A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → **A0 is better**

A0 becomes a **dominant strategy** for me! The same applies to my opponent by symmetry.

## Step 5: Decision

With the contract:
- A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both players
- The unique Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) with 5 points each
- This is the best possible outcome and eliminates coordination risk

Without the contract, we risk ending up at the inferior (A1, A1) equilibrium or miscoordinating.

**I should sign the contract.**

Under each proposed contract (they’re identical), the “bonus/penalty” is a pure transfer between players:

- If I play **A0**: I receive **+2** taken from the other player.
- If I play **A1**: I pay **2** to the other player (so I get **−2**).

So my **net payoffs** become:

- (A0, A0): 5 +2−2 = **5**
- (A0, A1): 0 +2 = **2**
- (A1, A0): 3 −2 = **1**
- (A1, A1): 3 −2+2 = **3**

This keeps the two pure equilibria (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), but it makes **A0 much less “risky”**: I choose A0 whenever I believe the other plays A0 with probability > 0.2 (instead of > 0.6 without the contract). That shifts behavior toward the high-payoff coordination outcome (A0,A0), which is good for me.

Since C1 and C2 are the same, I approve both.

2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

1) Incorporate the contract into payoffs (2 players, so the whole ±2 transfers happen between us):
- If I choose **A0**: I **receive +2** from the other player.
- If I choose **A1**: I **pay -2** to the other player.
- If the other chooses **A0**: I **pay -2** to them.
- If the other chooses **A1**: I **receive +2** from them.

2) Compute my adjusted payoff for each outcome (base payoff + my contract effect + other’s contract effect):
- (A0, A0): 5 +2 −2 = **5**
- (A0, A1): 0 +2 +2 = **4**
- (A1, A0): 3 −2 −2 = **−1**
- (A1, A1): 3 −2 +2 = **3**

3) Best response:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives −1 → prefer **A0**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3 → prefer **A0**

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**, and the optimal strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing my total points in this game, let's delve into the rules and payoffs step-by-step, taking into account the additional payment contract.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding Direct Payoffs**: 
   - If both choose A0, I get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
   - If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, I get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
   - If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, I get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
   - If both choose A1, I get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

2. **Understanding Contract Effects**:
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 5 points taken from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, there are no additional point exchanges.

3. **Total Payoff Calculation**:
   - Both choose A0: I get 5 (payoff) + 5 (contract) - 5 (to other player) = 5 points.
   - I choose A0, other chooses A1: I get 0 (payoff) + 5 (contract) - 5 (to other player) = -5 points.
   - I choose A1, other chooses A0: I get 3 points.
   - Both choose A1: I get 3 points.

4. **Optimizing Strategy**:
   - Evaluating the payoffs:
     - Both choosing A0 results in me getting 5 points in total.
     - My choosing A0 and other choosing A1 means I lose 5 points in total.
     - My choosing A1 and other choosing A0 results in me getting 3 points.
     - Both choosing A1 gives me 3 points.

Since choosing A0 when Player 1 also chooses A0 nets me 5 points (the maximum) while any scenario where I choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1 results in a loss, careful consideration is needed. If I choose A1 and Player 1 also chooses A1, I get a stable 3 points. Therefore, I need to estimate Player 1's strategy:

- Player 1 has an incentive to choose A0 to receive the extra points.
- If Player 1 expects me to gain more from choosing A1, they might avoid A0.

Because of the contract, Player 1 might choose A0 with a likely higher probability to benefit from the 10-point net gain between players choosing A0 simultaneously. The best counter-strategy is a mixed one:

### Final Strategy:
Given the likely higher propensity of Player 1 to choose A0, I will assign a higher probability to A1, ensuring a balance between the expected outcomes.

Therefore, a practical and balanced probability distribution could be:
- Weighting A0 slightly because it has potential gain if both choose A0.
- Predominantly choosing A1 anticipating maximizing points if Player 1 chooses A0.

### JSON Object Format:

```json
{
  "A0": 40,
  "A1": 60
}
```

This mixed strategy assigns a higher likelihood to A1, anticipating Player 1 will often choose A0 to exploit the contract's additional benefit. This setup aims to balance the payoffs and manage risks effectively.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

- Respond with a valid JSON object.

response:
Certainly, let's break down the decision-making process step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding Payoffs without Contract
First, let's reiterate the payoffs for the basic game without the contract:
- If both players choose A0, each gets 5 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 3 points and Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 0 points and Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If both players choose A1, each gets 3 points.

### Step 2: Understanding Payoffs with Contract
Now, let's see how the payoffs change with the contract:
- Choosing A0 gives an additional 2 points.
- Choosing A1 incurs a cost of 2 points.

Let's compute the new payoffs under the contract:
- If both players choose A0:
  - Each gets 5 points + 2 points = 7 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1 gets 3 points + 2 points = 5 points.
  - Player 2 gets 0 points - 2 points = -2 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1 gets 0 points - 2 points = -2 points.
  - Player 2 gets 3 points + 2 points = 5 points.
- If both players choose A1:
  - Each gets 3 points - 2 points = 1 point.

### Step 3: Evaluating Choice Probabilities
Without the contract, both players playing A0 (giving each 5 points) appears strongly dominant as it maximizes their payoffs. But with the contract:
- The net gain from both playing A0 is 7 points, which is the highest.
- The net gain where Player 2 benefits most (if Player 2 plays A1 and Player 1 plays A0) is only 5 points.
- The worst scenario under the contract is both choosing A1, resulting in only 1 point each.

### Step 4: Rational Decision to Sign the Contract
Given the contract significantly penalizes the A1 choice and heavily incentivizes A0:
- Both players opting for A0 becomes the most beneficial scenario.
- The contract eliminates the incentive for either player to choose A1 due to the severe penalty.

### Conclusion
Given the fact that under the contract, both choosing A0 increases points from 5 to 7 as opposed to scenarios involving A1 which lead to penalties and lower net payoffs, it's in Player 2's interest to sign the contract. Assuming Player 1 is rational and seeks to maximize their points too, they should also find this contract beneficial and agree to it.

Thus, Player 2 should choose to sign the contract.

### Final Answer

{"sign": true}

First incorporate the contract into the payoffs (2 players, so all transfers are between you and Player 1):

- If **you play A0**: you **gain +2** from Player 1. If you play **A1**: you **pay -2** to Player 1.  
- If **Player 1 plays A0**: Player 1 gains +2 from you, so **you lose -2**. If Player 1 plays **A1**: Player 1 pays -2 to you, so **you gain +2**.

Now compute your final payoff in each outcome = (base payoff) + (your contract effect) + (opponent contract effect):

1) You A0, P1 A0: base 5 +2 −2 = **5**  
2) You A0, P1 A1: base 0 +2 +2 = **4**  
3) You A1, P1 A0: base 3 −2 −2 = **−1**  
4) You A1, P1 A1: base 3 −2 +2 = **3**

Comparison:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives −1 → choose **A0**
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3 → choose **A0**

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**, and the best strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.

response:
To determine whether Player 2 should sign the contract, let's analyze the game with and without it.

### **1. Original Game Analysis**
The original payoff matrix for Player 2 and Player 1 (P2, P1) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Player 2's Incentives:**
- If P1 chooses A0, P2's best response is A0 (5 points vs. 3 points).
- If P1 chooses A1, P2's best response is A1 (3 points vs. 0 points).

This is a coordination-style game. There are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) yields more points (5 points), A0 is risky for Player 2 because if P1 chooses A1, Player 2 receives 0 points.

### **2. The Contract**
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

If both players sign, the matrix is modified:
- **(A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives 4 points and pays 4 points.
  - P2 payoff: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
  - P1 payoff: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
- **(A0, A1):** P2 chooses A0, P1 chooses A1. P2 receives 4 points from P1.
  - P2 payoff: 0 + 4 = 4
  - P1 payoff: 3 - 4 = -1
- **(A1, A0):** P2 chooses A1, P1 chooses A0. P1 receives 4 points from P2.
  - P2 payoff: 3 - 4 = -1
  - P1 payoff: 0 + 4 = 4
- **(A1, A1):** Neither receives or pays points.
  - P2 payoff: 3
  - P1 payoff: 3

### **3. Contracted Game Analysis**
Now, let's look at Player 2's incentives with the contract:
- If P1 chooses A0, P2 gets 5 (A0) or -1 (A1). **A0 is better.**
- If P1 chooses A1, P2 gets 4 (A0) or 3 (A1). **A0 is better.**

Under the contract, **A0 becomes a dominant strategy** for Player 2. The same logic applies to Player 1 (A0 is dominant for them as well). Therefore, if the contract is signed, both players will choose A0, resulting in a (5, 5) payoff.

### **Conclusion**
- **Security:** Without the contract, choosing A0 is risky (0 points possible). With the contract, choosing A0 is the best move regardless of the other player's choice.
- **Outcome:** The contract guarantees an environment where both players are incentivized to move toward the highest-paying outcome (5, 5).
- **Risk-Free Signing:** Signing the contract only impacts the game if the other player also signs. Since the contract creates a dominant strategy that leads to the maximum possible payoff, it is in your best interest to sign.

response:
Let's break down the problem to make an informed decision on the optimal probability distribution over actions \(A0\) and \(A1\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Payoffs Overview:

1. **If both players select A0:**
   - Player 2 receives 5 points.
   - Player 1 receives 5 points.
2. **If Player 2 selects A0 and Player 1 selects A1:**
   - Player 2 receives 0 points.
   - Player 1 receives 3 points.
3. **If Player 2 selects A1 and Player 1 selects A0:**
   - Player 2 receives 3 points.
   - Player 1 receives 0 points.
4. **If both players select A1:**
   - Player 2 receives 3 points.
   - Player 1 receives 3 points.

#### Contract Analysis:
Since Player 1 rejected the contract, it is not active. So, we only consider the original payoffs as described above.

#### Strategy Consideration:
Since the game is symmetric with respect to the actions and payoffs, we can assume that Player 1 will aim to maximize their own points rationally.

#### Calculating Expected Utilities:

Let \( p \) be the probability that Player 1 chooses \( A0 \), and \( 1 - p \) be the probability that Player 1 chooses \( A1 \).
Similarly, let \( q \) be the probability that Player 2 (you) chooses \( A0 \), and \( 1 - q \) be the probability that you choose \( A1 \).

We need to calculate the expected value of choosing A0 and A1 for you and compare them.

**Expected value if you choose \( A0 \):**
\[ \text{E}(A0) = 5p + 0(1-p) \]
\[ \text{E}(A0) = 5p \]

**Expected value if you choose \( A1 \):**
\[ \text{E}(A1) = 3(1-p) + 3p \]
\[ \text{E}(A1) = 3 \]

To maximize your utility, align the probabilities such that \( \text{E}(A0) = \text{E}(A1) \):

\[ 5p = 3 \]

Solving for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \]

Thus, Player 1 will choose \( A0 \) with a probability of \( 0.6 \) and \( A1 \) with a probability of \( 0.4 \).

#### Determining Your Optimal Strategy:
Now, knowing Player 1’s mixed strategy, we should choose probabilities \( q \) (for \( A0 \)) and \( 1 - q \) (for \( A1 \)) that maximize our expected points.

To find the optimal response to Player 1's strategy:

\[ \text{E}(A0) = 5(0.6) = 3 \]
\[ \text{E}(A1) = 3 \]

Both choices \( A0 \) and \( A1 \) yield the same expected utility for us, given Player 1’s mixed strategy. Thus, a mixed strategy for Player 2 where \( q = 0.6 \) and \( 1 - q = 0.4 \) is also optimal.

### Conclusion:

To maximize expected points, Player 2 should align their strategy with the mixed strategy of Player 1. The probability distribution over actions \( A0 \) and \( A1 \) for you (Player 2) should be the same 60% and 40%.

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "A0": 60,
  "A1": 40
}

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate modified payoffs with the contract

The contract adds payments when A1 is chosen (-4 points to the player choosing it, +4 to the other player).

**Modified payoffs for me (Player 2):**

- **(A0, A0)**: 5 (base) + 0 (no contract payments) = **5**
- **(A0, A1)**: 0 (base) + 4 (I receive from opponent's payment) = **4**  
- **(A1, A0)**: 3 (base) - 4 (I pay) = **-1**
- **(A1, A1)**: 3 (base) - 4 (I pay) + 4 (I receive) = **3**

## Step 2: Determine best response

Let me compare my payoffs for each action given what the opponent might do:

**If opponent plays A0:**
- My A0 gives: 5
- My A1 gives: -1
- **A0 is better**

**If opponent plays A1:**
- My A0 gives: 4
- My A1 gives: 3
- **A0 is better**

## Step 3: Identify dominant strategy

A0 gives me strictly higher payoffs regardless of what the opponent does. This means **A0 is a dominant strategy**.

## Step 4: Verify Nash equilibrium

The game is symmetric due to the contract structure. Both players face the same incentives, so both will choose A0. At (A0, A0):
- Each player gets 5 points
- Neither player benefits from deviating to A1 (would get -1 instead)

This is a Nash equilibrium and the optimal outcome.

## Conclusion

The contract successfully penalizes A1 enough to make A0 the dominant strategy for both players, achieving the cooperative outcome.

Let's work through this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)

We are Player 2 in a simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff table (Player 1, Player 2):

|         | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P2: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

So for **Player 2**, the payoffs are:
- If P1 plays A0:  
  - A0 → 5  
  - A1 → 0  
- If P1 plays A1:  
  - A0 → 3  
  - A1 → 3

From Player 2’s perspective:
- A0 is better when P1 plays A0 (5 vs 0), but worse when P1 plays A1 (3 vs 3 – tie).
- A1 is always at least as good as A0 when P1 plays A1, and better than A0 when P1 plays A0.

But notice: **A1 weakly dominates A0** for Player 2?
Wait — let's check:

- A0: if P1 plays A0 → 5, if P1 plays A1 → 3 → expected = 5p + 3(1-p) = 3 + 2p
- A1: always gives 3 points, regardless of P1’s action

So A0 gives more than A1 only if 3 + 2p > 3 → p > 0.

But when p = 1 (P1 plays A0), A0 gives 5 > 3 → A0 better.
When p = 0, A0 gives 3 = 3 → same.

So A0 gives higher payoff only when P1 plays A0 with positive probability.

But since A2 only gets 3 from A1 regardless, and 3 or 5 from A0, **A0 is better if P1 plays A0 often**, but **A1 is safer**.

But there’s a **Nash equilibrium** here.

Try to find Nash equilibria.

- Is (A0, A0) a Nash?  
  P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 5 from A0, 3 from A1 → so A0 is best → yes  
  P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 5 from A0, 3 from A1 → A0 best → yes  
  So (A0, A0) is a NE.

- Is (A1, A1) a Nash?  
  P1: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 from A0, 3 from A1 → indifferent → could play A1  
  P2: same → gets 3 in both → indifferent  
  So (A1, A1) is also a NE.

- Is (A0, A1) a NE? P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3  
  But P1 can deviate to A1 → get 3 > 0 → so not NE.

- Is (A1, A0)? P1: A1, P2: A0 → P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0  
  P2: if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 3 from A1, 0 from A0 → so P2 wants to switch → not NE.

So two pure NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

There may be mixed strategy NE as well, but we can come back to that if needed.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contracts

Now, contracts propose **additional payments** based on your action.

Important: The **payment is drawn equally from the other player**.

That means:
- If a player gains +X, that X is taken from the other player (or distributed equally — wording is "drawn equally from the other players").
- Since only two players, "drawn equally from the other players" means the whole amount is taken from the other player.

So:
- If you get +5 for playing A0, the other player pays -5.
- If you pay -2 for playing A1, that -2 is given to the other player.

---

### Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1):

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments.

So:
- If you play A0 → +5 (from the other player)
- If you play A1 → 0

This is a **benefit for A0**.

But note: **Player 1 proposed this contract.** So Player 1 wants to encourage players to play A0.

But we are **Player 2**, and we are choosing whether to **approve** this contract.

If the contract is approved, it will be implemented.

So we need to ask: **Does this contract increase my expected payoff (as Player 2), assuming the other player chooses rationally?**

That is, under the contract, do we want to play A0 or A1? And how does the contract affect the game?

Let’s recompute the **total payoff** for Player 2 when the contract is in effect.

---

#### Evaluate C1 (proposed by P1):

After contract, **if you play A0 → get +5**, regardless of opponent.

So total payoffs change:

|         | P1: A0 (P2: A0) | P1: A1 (P2: A0) |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **P2: A0** | 5 + 5 = 10 | 3 + 5 = 8 |
| **P2: A1** | 3 + 0 = 3 | 3 + 0 = 3 |

Wait — no. The contract says: **if you play A0, you get +5, taken from the other**.

So it’s **independent of what the other player does** — just depends on *your* action.

So for **Player 2**:
- If you play A0 → +5
- If you play A1 → 0

So the **payoff matrix becomes** (Player 1, Player 2):

|         | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (5, 10) | (0, 8) |
| **P2: A1** | (3, 3) | (3, 3) |

Let’s go back: base payoffs, then add +5 to the **player who played A0**.

So when P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0:
- Base: (5,5), now P1 gets +5 (from contract), P2 gets +5 → (10,10)

Wait — mistake!

The contract says: "if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player."

"Each player" — so if **both** play A0, both get +5, and since there's only one other player, that means **each takes +5 from the other**.

But that’s impossible — both can't take +5 from each other.

Wait, this is critical.

The phrasing: “drawn equally from the other players” suggests that **each player who plays A0 gets a bonus of 5, funded by the other player**.

But if both play A0, then:
- Player 1 gets +5 from Player 2 (who pays it)
- Player 2 gets +5 from Player 1 (who pays it)

So net for each: +5 – 5 = 0? That can't be — it would cancel.

But the contract says: **"drawn equally from the other players"**.

Wait — if there are multiple other players, the cost is split among them. But there are **only two players**.

So: if you play A0, you get +5, and it's drawn **equally from the other players**.

Since only one other player, the **entire** 5 is taken from them.

So:
- When both play A0: Player 1 gets +5 (from P2), Player 2 gets +5 (from P1) → but they are both paying and receiving.
- So **net**: P1: +5 (from P2) – 5 (to P2) = 0? No — that’s not right.

Wait — let’s read carefully: **"If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."**

This means: **Each player who chooses A0 receives +5, and the total amount comes from the other players**.

But if both choose A0, then:
- The total bonus to be paid: 5 (for P1) + 5 (for P2) = 10
- This 10 must be drawn from the **other players**.

But since there is only one other player for each, the **other player** must pay the full 5.

So:
- P1 gets +5, funded by P2
- P2 gets +5, funded by P1

So each pays 5 to the other? Net: zero.

But that’s not sustainable — it’s like a cross-payment.

But the **payment is drawn from other players**, so it's from the **opponent**.

So if P1 plays A0, they get +5, **paid by P2**.
If P2 plays A0, they get +5, **paid by P1**.

So if both play A0:
- P1: base 5 + +5 (from P2) = 10
- P2: base 5 + +5 (from P1) = 10

But P1 pays 5 to P2, P2 pays 5 to P1 → so net transfer: 0, net gain: 10 each.

Yes — it's symmetric.

So final payoffs for C1:

|         | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (5+5=10, 5+5=10) | (0+5=5, 3+5=8) |
| **P2: A1** | (3+0=3, 0+0=0) | (3+0=3, 3+0=3) |

Wait — correction: the bonus is only if the player plays A0.

So:
- If P1 plays A0 → gets +5 from P2
- If P2 plays A0 → gets +5 from P1

So only the player who played A0 gets the +5.

So:
- (A0, A0): both get +5 → P1: 5+5=10, P2: 5+5=10
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +5, P2 plays A1 → gets 0 → base: (0,3), so total: (0+5=5, 3+0=3)
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → gets 0, P2 plays A0 → gets +5 → base: (3,0), so total: (3+0=3, 0+5=5)
- (A1, A1): both get 0 → (3,3)

So final payoff matrix under C1:

|         | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (10,10) | (5,3) |
| **P2: A1** | (3,5) | (3,3) |

Now, **as Player 2**, look at the payoffs:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - A0 → 10
  - A1 → 3 → so A0 is better
- If P1 plays A1:
  - A0 → 3
  - A1 → 3 → tie

So **A0 weakly dominates A1** for Player 2 under C1 — because when P1 plays A0, you get 10 vs 3; when P1 plays A1, 3 vs 3.

Thus, Player 2 will always prefer A0.

Likewise, check Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - A0 → 10
  - A1 → 3 → A0 better
- If P2 plays A1:
  - A0 → 5
  - A1 → 3 → A0 better

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1 too.

So under C1, **both players will play A0**, and the outcome is (A0, A0), with payoffs (10,10) — much better than original (5,5).

But **we are Player 2**, and we get 10 instead of 5.

So **C1 is very good for Player 2**.

So we should **approve C1**.

But wait — is that realistic?

Yes — the contract is proposed by Player 1, but we get to approve it.

And if it passes, we both play A0 and get 10 each.

So **C1 is very beneficial to Player 2**.

Now, what about C2?

---

### Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2):

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Again, both players are symmetric in the wording.

So:
- If you play A0 → get +1
- If you play A1 → pay -2 (i.e., lose 2 points, which go to the other player)

Now, what happens when both play A0?

- P1 gets +1 (from P2)
- P2 gets +1 (from P1)
- So net: each gets +1

Base: (5,5) → total (6,6)

(A0,A0): (5+1=6, 5+1=6)

(A0,A1):
- P1: plays A0 → gets +1 (from P2)
- P2: plays A1 → pays -2 (so loses 2, which goes to P1)
- Base: (0,3) → total: (0+1=1, 3–2=1)

(A1,A0):
- P1: A1 → pays -2 (to P2)
- P2: A0 → gets +1 (from P1)
- Base: (3,0) → total: (3–2=1, 0+1=1)

(A1,A1):
- Both play A1 → each pays -2 → goes to other
- So P1 loses 2 (to P2), P2 loses 2 (to P1) → net: 0 for each
- Base: (3,3) → total: (3–2=1, 3–2=1)

So the payoff matrix under C2 is:

|         | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (6,6) | (1,1) |
| **P2: A1** | (1,1) | (1,1) |

Wait — hold on.

For (A0,A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +1 from P2; P2 plays A1 → pays -2 to P1 → so P1 gets +1 - (-2)? No.

Clarify:

- The payment is **in addition** to base.

So:
- P1’s total payoff = base + bonus/payout

For (A0, A1):
- Base: (0,3)
- P1: plays A0 → gets +1
- P2: plays A1 → pays -2 → so P2 loses 2
- So P1: 0 + 1 = 1
- P2: 3 + (–2) = 1

For (A1, A0):
- P1: plays A1 → pays -2 → gets -2
- P2: plays A0 → gets +1
- Base: (3,0)
- So P1: 3 – 2 = 1
- P2: 0 + 1 = 1

For (A1, A1):
- Both play A1 → each pays -2 → so each loses 2
- Base: (3,3)
- So (3–2=1, 3–2=1)

For (A0, A0):
- Both get +1
- So (5+1=6, 5+1=6)

So yes:

|         | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (6,6) | (1,1) |
| **P2: A1** | (1,1) | (1,1) |

So **regardless of the other player's choice**, if you play A1, you get only 1.

If you play A0, you get 6 if the other plays A0, 1 if the other plays A1.

But **as Player 2**, what should you do?

- If P1 plays A0 → then:
  - P2: A0 → 6
  - A1 → 1 → so A0 is better
- If P1 plays A1 → then:
  - P2: A0 → 1
  - A1 → 1 → same

So **A0 weakly dominates A1** for Player 2.

But the key is: **what will the other player do?**

Player 1’s incentives:

- If P2 plays A0 → P1: A0 → 6, A1 → 1 → A0 better
- If P2 plays A1 → P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent

So **P1 prefers A0 if P2 plays A0**, and is indifferent if P2 plays A1.

So P1 will play **A0** if they think P2 might play A0.

But in equilibrium, both will likely play A0 — because if both play A0, they get 6 each — much better than 1.

So **both players have incentive to play A0**.

In fact, (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium under C2.

(A1, A1) is not — because if P2 plays A1, P1 can deviate to A0 and get 1 → same → so indifferent.

But since (A0, A0) yields 6 > 1, players will coordinate on A0.

So expected outcome: (A0, A0), payoffs (6,6) — better than base (5,5), and better than C1's (10,10)? No — 6 < 10.

But **for Player 2**, under C2: 6 points
Under C1: 10 points

So C1 gives higher payoff.

But is C1 really better?

Yes — 10 > 6.

But wait — is C1 really sustainable?

In C1, we have:
- Both play A0 → get 10 each

But **who benefits more?**

In C1, **the bonus is +5 for A0**, so both get 5 extra.

In C2, bonus is only +1 for A0, but penalty of -2 for A1.

But **C1 gives a bigger reward for A0**, so it pushes players toward A0 more strongly.

And **the outcome is better** for Player 2: 10 vs 6.

So **C1 is better for Player 2**.

But **we must consider approval**: we can approve multiple contracts.

The contract that **wins** is selected uniformly at random from those with **maximum approvals**.

So we want to approve contracts that are **good for us**, and that are **likely to pass** (i.e., not all approved by others).

But the problem says: "the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So **our approval matters for increasing the number of approvals**.

But since we are only one player, and the other player is Player 1, we don't know their approval.

But we are to **maximize our total points**, **assuming the contract is selected**.

So:

- We want to **maximize our expected payoff** from the final contract.
- The final contract is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So to maximize our payoff, we need to choose a set of contracts to approve such that:
- The maximum approval count is as high as possible (to have more contracts in the pool), **but more importantly**, we want the **best** contract(s) in that pool to be as good as possible for us.

But if we approve only C1, and Player 1 approves only C1 (possibly), then C1 has 2 approvals (if we both approve), then it wins.

But if we approve both C1 and C2, then if only C1 gets more approvals, it wins.

But we don’t know what Player 1 will do.

So we must assume Player 1 is rational and acts in their self-interest.

So let’s analyze **Player 1’s rational preferences**.

---

### Player 1’s Perspective

#### C1 (proposed by P1)

Payoffs under C1:

|         | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (10,10) | (5,3) |
| **P2: A1** | (3,5) | (3,3) |

So for Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 → 10, A1 → 3 → A0 better
- If P2 plays A1: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → A0 better

So A0 strictly dominant → play A0

Then P2 will play A0 (as we saw), result: (10,10)

So Player 1 gets 10.

#### C2 (proposed by P2)

Payoffs under C2:

|         | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (6,6) | (1,1) |
| **P2: A1** | (1,1) | (1,1) |

For Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 → 6, A1 → 1 → A0 better
- If P2 plays A1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent

So **A0 dominates A1** (weakly, but still best choice)

So P1 will play A0

Then P2 will play A0 (as we saw)

Result: (6,6)

Player 1 gets 6.

So **Player 1 prefers C1 (10) over C2 (6)**.

Therefore, **Player 1 will approve C1**, and **will not approve C2**.

Now, **we are Player 2**.

We want to maximize our payoff.

We expect Player 1 to:
- Approve C1 (because it gives them 10)
- Not approve C2 (because it gives them only 6)

So:
- If we approve **only C1**, then:
  - C1 has 2 approvals (us and P1)
  - C2 has 1 approval (only us)
  - Max approvals = 2 → only C1 is selected → C1 wins
  - We get 10

- If we approve **both C1 and C2**:
  - C1: 2 approvals
  - C2: 2 approvals (us and P1? No — P1 doesn’t approve C2)
    - P1 only approves C1
    - So C2 has only 1 approval
  - Max approvals = 2 (C1 has 2, C2 has 1) → C1 wins
  - We get 10

- If we approve **neither**:
  - C1: 1 approval (P1 only)
  - C2: 1 approval (us only)
  - Max approvals = 1 → both are in max set → chosen uniformly at random
  - So with 50% chance C1 (we get 10), 50% chance C2 (we get 6)
  - Expected payoff: 0.5×10 + 0.5×6 = 5 + 3 = 8

But 8 < 10, so worse.

- If we approve **only C2**:
  - C1: 1 approval (only P1)
  - C2: 2 approvals (us and ... P1 only approves C1, so only us) → so C2 has 1 approval
  - Max approvals = 1 → both in pool → pick uniformly: 50% C1 (we get 10), 50% C2 (we get 6)
  - Expected: 8

So **our best option is to approve C1**.

We get 10 in all cases where we approve C1 (because C1 wins when approved by us and P1).

If we don’t approve C1, we risk getting only 6 or 8.

Therefore, **we should approve C1**.

Should we approve C2?

If we approve C2, it doesn’t hurt us — but if we approve both, we still get the same outcome (C1 wins).

But C2 gives us only 6, and we get 10 from C1.

So approving C2 doesn’t help us — it just adds a contract that won’t win.

But it doesn’t **hurt** — because even if we approve C2, C1 still wins.

But does it help?

No — we get the same payoff.

But since we are trying to **maximize total points**, and we don’t get more from C2, we can approve or disapprove.

But is there a risk?

Suppose we **do not approve C1**, but approve C2.

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (P1)
- C2: 1 approval (us)
- Max approvals = 1 → both in pool → random draw → 50% chance C1 (10), 50% C2 (6) → expected 8 < 10

So worse.

But if we approve C1 and C2:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 1 approval → so max is 2 → C1 wins → we get 10

So same as approving only C1.

So **approving C2 is neutral** — we don’t get worse, but we don’t get better.

But since the question is to **maximize total points**, and we get 10 either way, it doesn’t matter.

But **should we approve C2?**

Only if it benefits us.

But it doesn’t — we never get the benefit from C2 unless it wins, but it never wins when we approve C1 (since C1 has more approvals).

But if we **don’t approve C1**, and only approve C2, we get expected 8.

So to maximize, we must approve C1.

But we can also approve C2 — it doesn’t harm.

But the question is: **do we approve?**

Since approving C2 doesn’t hurt us, and we don’t lose anything, but also don’t gain — but is there a reason to approve?

Only if we believe that approving C2 might increase the chances of something better.

But C2 is worse for us.

But wait — if we **approve both**, then C1 wins → we get 10.

If we approve only C1, same thing.

So both strategies give us 10.

But suppose Player 1 changes — but we assume rational behavior.

So **both actions give us 10**.

So we can choose to approve C2 or not.

But to be safe, and since it doesn’t hurt, we can approve.

But is there a downside?

No — we only lose if we approve C2 and it wins — but it won’t win.

So no downside.

But perhaps we should not approve C2 — because it’s worse for us and only complicates.

But the problem says: **maximize total points**.

And both strategies give us 10.

So we can approve both.

But let’s see — **does approving C2 affect the outcome?** No.

So from a decision-making perspective, **it doesn’t matter**.

But to be optimal, we should only approve what benefits us.

But since it doesn’t cost anything, and might not hurt, but doesn’t help, we could include it.

But actually, **it might affect the approval count**.

Suppose only we approve C2 — it gets 1 approval.

But if we **don’t approve it**, it still gets 1.

So no change.

But in terms of payoff, it’s irrelevant.

So to maximize, we should approve only C1.

But let's see the final answer format.

We must output all contracts.

C1 and C2.

We want to approve C1 — yes.

C2 — no, because it gives us less than C1, and we won’t get it anyway.

But since approving it doesn’t hurt, and we are free to approve, why not?

But our goal is to **maximize total points**, and we get 10 in both cases.

So approval of C2 is **irrelevant**.

But the **contract selection is uniform at random from those with max approvals**.

If we approve C2, then:
- C1: 2 approvals (us and P1)
- C2: 1 approval (only us) → max is 2 → only C1 is in the max set → C1 wins → we get 10

If we don’t approve C2:
- C1: 2
- C2: 1 → same → C1 wins

So in both cases, same.

So **we can approve C2 or not**.

But since the contract is **proposed by Player 2**, and we are Player 2, and C2 gives us less than C1, and we prefer C1, we should **not approve C2**.

But is there a reason to approve it?

No — it doesn’t help us.

In fact, if we approve C2, we are spending an approval on a contract that won’t win, and we could have used it elsewhere — but there are no other contracts.

But we are not constrained in number.

But since it doesn’t help and we are trying to maximize, we should **only approve C1**.

Moreover, if we approve both, the system may consider it, but the outcome is the same.

But to be precise, **approving C2 does not increase our expected payoff**, so we should **not** approve it.

But the question is: do we approve?

We should **approve C1**, **not approve C2**.

Final decision:

- C1: approve → true
- C2: disapprove → false

Because approving C2 gives us no benefit, and we don’t want to support a contract that gives us less.

Even though it doesn’t hurt, **we are to maximize our payoff**, so we should only support contracts that are good for us.

And C2 gives us only 6, while C1 gives 10.

So we want C1 to win.

So we should approve C1 and reject C2.

But in case we reject C1, we get 8 expected — worse.

So only way to get 10 is to approve C1.

Now, **but wait**: what if Player 1 doesn’t approve C1?

But we assumed Player 1 does — because it gives them 10 > 6.

So they will.

So our only safe path to 10 is to approve C1.

So approve C1.

Reject C2.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we first incorporate the payment contract into the original payoff matrix. The contract specifies that selecting A0 results in a net transfer of 4 points from the other player to the selector, while selecting A1 results in no transfer.

1.  **Modified Payoff Calculation**:

    *   **Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1**: Original (0, 3). Player 1 receives 4 from Player 2. Net: (0+4, 3-4) = **(4, -1)**.
    *   **Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0**: Original (3, 0). Player 2 receives 4 from Player 1. Net: (3-4, 0+4) = **(-1, 4)**.
    *   **Both choose A1**: No transfers. Original (3, 3) = **(3, 3)**.

2.  **Strategic Analysis (for Player 2)**:
    *   If Player 1 chooses **A0**, Player 2 earns **5** with A0 and **-1** with A1.
    *   If Player 1 chooses **A1**, Player 2 earns **4** with A0 and **3** with A1.

In both scenarios, A0 provides a higher payoff than A1. Therefore, A0 is the strictly dominant strategy for maximizing points.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 4 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

### Step 1: Understand the base incentives
Base payoff matrix (Player 1 payoff listed first):

- (A0, A0) → (5, 5)  
- (A0, A1) → (0, 3)  
- (A1, A0) → (3, 0)  
- (A1, A1) → (3, 3)

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria: **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)**.

---

### Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)
Rule:  
- If you play **A0**, you **receive +2** from the other player.  
- If you play **A1**, you **pay 2** to the other player.

With 2 players, transfers are directly between the two players. Compute Player 1’s resulting payoffs:

- (A0, A0): both receive +2 and both pay +2 → net 0 transfer → **5**
- (A0, A1): P1 gets base 0 + receives 2 (because P1 played A0, and P2 must pay) → **2**
- (A1, A0): P1 gets base 3 − pays 2 → **1**
- (A1, A1): both pay 2 and both receive 2 → net 0 → **3**

So P1 payoff matrix becomes:

- If P2 plays A0: A0 gives 5, A1 gives 1 → best response **A0**
- If P2 plays A1: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 → best response **A1**

So C1 **still leaves two equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1). That means there is still coordination risk, and you could end up in the worse equilibrium (A1,A1) with payoff 3.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)
Rule:
- Playing **A0**: no transfers
- Playing **A1**: you **pay 4** to the other player

Compute Player 1’s resulting payoffs:

- (A0, A0): **5**
- (A0, A1): base 0 + receive 4 (since P2 played A1 and pays 4) → **4**
- (A1, A0): base 3 − pay 4 → **-1**
- (A1, A1): both pay 4 and receive 4 → net 0 → **3**

Now check best responses for Player 1:

- If P2 plays A0: A0=5 vs A1=-1 → **A0**
- If P2 plays A1: A0=4 vs A1=3 → **A0**

So under C2, **A0 is strictly dominant**, and the unique equilibrium is **(A0, A0)** giving you **5 for sure**.

---

### Step 4: Approval decision
- **C2** is clearly beneficial: it removes coordination risk and guarantees the high-payoff outcome (5).
- **C1** is risky: it still allows the low equilibrium (A1,A1) with payoff 3, and approving it can only increase the chance it gets selected (depending on the approval vote situation).

So: **approve C2, reject C1**.

```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}

**Step 1: Start from the base game**
Payoffs (Player 1 first):

- (A0, A0) = (5, 5)  
- (A0, A1) = (0, 3)  
- (A1, A0) = (3, 0)  
- (A1, A1) = (3, 3)

There are two pure equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

---

**Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (Player 1’s proposal)**
Rule:  
- If you play **A0**: you **receive +2** (taken from the other player)  
- If you play **A1**: you **pay -2** (given to the other player)

With 2 players, transfers are directly between the two players. Player 1’s net transfer depends on both actions.

Compute Player 1 payoffs:

- (A0, A0): base 5 + (P1 +2) + (P2 A0 ⇒ P1 pays 2) = 5  
- (A0, A1): base 0 + (P1 +2) + (P2 A1 ⇒ P1 receives 2) = 4  
- (A1, A0): base 3 + (P1 -2) + (P2 A0 ⇒ P1 pays 2) = -1  
- (A1, A1): base 3 + (P1 -2) + (P2 A1 ⇒ P1 receives 2) = 3  

So P1 payoff matrix becomes:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 gives 5, A1 gives -1 → **A0 better**
- If P2 plays A1: A0 gives 4, A1 gives 3 → **A0 better**

Thus **A0 is strictly dominant**, so the unique outcome is (A0,A0) giving **5** to me.

---

**Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (Player 2’s proposal)**
Rule:
- If you play **A0**: you **receive +1**
- If you play **A1**: you **pay -2**

Compute Player 1 payoffs:

- (A0, A0): base 5 + (P1 +1) + (P2 A0 ⇒ P1 pays 1) = 5  
- (A0, A1): base 0 + (P1 +1) + (P2 A1 ⇒ P1 receives 2) = 3  
- (A1, A0): base 3 + (P1 -2) + (P2 A0 ⇒ P1 pays 1) = 0  
- (A1, A1): base 3 + (P1 -2) + (P2 A1 ⇒ P1 receives 2) = 3  

So P1 payoff matrix becomes [[5,3],[0,3]]. Here **A0 is only weakly dominant**, and (A1,A1) can still be an equilibrium (since if the other plays A1, I’m indifferent between A0 and A1).

So C2 is **not as good as C1** at guaranteeing the high-payoff coordination on A0.

---

**Step 4: Approval choice**
Approving C2 can only make it more likely to be selected (e.g., if Player 2 approves it), which risks selecting the weaker contract compared to C1. So I approve **only C1**.

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

Base game payoffs (My action, P1's action):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3) 
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

## Step 2: Analyze the base game without contracts

In the base game:
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A0 (5) over A1 (3)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (3) over A0 (0)

Neither action dominates, creating a coordination problem. There are two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5) - the better outcome
- (A1, A1) with payoffs (3, 3) - a worse outcome

There's also a mixed Nash equilibrium. This creates uncertainty and risk of coordination failure.

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs under Contract 1

With C1 (+2 for A0, -2 for A1):
- (A0, A0): 5+2-2 = (5, 5) [both get +2 from each other]
- (A0, A1): 0+2+2 = (4, -1) [I get +2 and receive P1's -2 penalty]
- (A1, A0): 3-2-2 = (-1, 4) [I pay -2 and P1 gets +2]
- (A1, A1): 3-2+2 = (3, 3) [both pay -2 to each other]

## Step 4: Calculate payoffs under Contract 2

With C2 (no change for A0, -4 for A1):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) [no changes]
- (A0, A1): 0+4 = (4, -1) [P1 pays -4 to me]
- (A1, A0): 3-4 = (-1, 4) [I pay -4 to P1]
- (A1, A1): 3-4+4 = (3, 3) [both pay -4 to each other]

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

Both C1 and C2 produce identical modified games!

Under both contracts:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1 → I prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: I get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → I prefer A0

**A0 now strictly dominates A1 for both players!**

This creates a unique dominant strategy equilibrium at (A0, A0) with guaranteed payoff of 5.

## Step 6: Decision

Both contracts:
1. Guarantee the best outcome (5, 5) through dominant strategies
2. Eliminate coordination failure risk
3. Remove the possibility of the worse equilibrium (3, 3)

Since both contracts are equivalent and strictly better than the uncertain base game, I should approve both.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game without the contract

The payoff matrix (my payoffs, opponent's payoffs):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

Without the contract, this game has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) yielding 5 points each - the good outcome
- (A1, A1) yielding 3 points each - the bad outcome

There's a coordination problem: we might end up in the worse equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- Playing A0: no payment
- Playing A1: pay 4 points to the other player

New payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) - no change
- (A0, A1): (0+4, 3-4) = (4, -1) - I receive 4 from opponent's payment
- (A1, A0): (3-4, 0+4) = (-1, 4) - I pay 4 to opponent
- (A1, A1): (3-4+4, 3-4+4) = (3, 3) - we pay each other, net zero

## Step 3: Find the equilibrium with contract

With the contract, checking my best responses:
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 points) over A1 (-1 points)
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A0 (4 points) over A1 (3 points)

**A0 becomes a strictly dominant strategy for both players!**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: Risk of coordination failure, possible 3-point equilibrium
- **With contract**: Guaranteed unique equilibrium at (A0, A0) giving 5 points each

The contract eliminates the bad equilibrium and guarantees the best outcome. Any rational player should sign this.

## Step 5: Decision

Signing the contract is optimal because:
1. If both sign → guaranteed 5 points (best possible)
2. If opponent doesn't sign → contract inactive, back to original game (no worse off)

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether you (Player 2) should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without the contract)

The original payoff matrix (you are Player 2, the other player is Player 1):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0        | A1        |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**              | (5, 5)    | (0, 3)    |
| **A1**              | (3, 0)    | (3, 3)    |

So:
- If both play A0: both get 5
- You play A0, they play A1: you get 0, they get 3
- You play A1, they play A0: you get 3, they get 0
- Both play A1: both get 3

This is **not** a classic prisoner's dilemma, but it has some similar structure.

Note that:
- For you (Player 2), **A0** is best when Player 1 plays A0 (5 > 3), but bad if they play A1 (0 < 3).
- A1 gives you 3 regardless of what they do (if they play A0: 3, if they play A1: 3), so **A1 is a dominant strategy for you** in the original game.

Let’s verify that.

### Step 2: Determine the best response in the original game

For you (Player 2):

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - A0: 5 points
  - A1: 3 points → better to play A0

- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - A0: 0 points
  - A1: 3 points → better to play A1

So your best response depends on what Player 1 does.

But now, suppose you are choosing a **probability distribution** over actions. You and Player 1 choose simultaneously.

This is a game with no pure strategy Nash equilibrium? Let's check.

Let’s compute mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let:
- You (Player 2) play A0 with probability p
- Player 1 play A0 with probability q

Then your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- If you play A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

Set equal for indifference: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5

So you are indifferent when q = 3/5.

Similarly, for Player 1:
- If they play A0: 5p + 3(1−p) = 2p + 3
- If they play A1: 0p + 3(1−p) = 3 − 3p

Set equal: 2p + 3 = 3 − 3p → 5p = 0 → p = 0

So in mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability 3/5, A1 with 2/5
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0, A1 with 1

So the unique mixed strategy equilibrium has you playing A1 with probability 1.

Thus, **your optimal strategy in the original game is to play A1 with probability 1**, and you expect to get 3 points.

But now we have a **contract** proposal.

---

### Step 3: Understand the contract

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- If **you** play A0 → you get +5 points
- But **you must pay 5 points to the other player** (since "drawn equally from the other players" — and there’s only one other player), so the other player gets +5 points from your choice of A0.

Wait: “drawn equally from the other players” — since there’s only one other player, that means **you pay 5 points to the other player** if you play A0.

So:
- If you play A0 → you gain +5, the other player gains +5 (from you)
- If you play A1 → nothing changes

Important note: this **only applies if you sign the contract**.

The contract becomes active **only if all players sign it**. So if you sign, but the other player doesn’t, then it does nothing.

But the contract was “selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1)”, so it may be that Player 1 wants it, but we don’t know if they’ll sign it.

But your decision is: should **you sign**?

We must assume that **if you sign**, and the other player also signs, then the contract applies.

But we don’t know whether the other player will sign. However, since it was proposed by Player 1 and approved via voting, it's possible they will sign. But we are only deciding on your action.

You need to decide whether to sign **given that the contract is proposed**, and it only applies if both sign.

So your payoff depends on:
- Whether you sign
- Whether the other player signs
- Your action choice

But since **you** control your action and your signing decision, and the other player controls theirs, and you both choose simultaneously, you must think strategically.

However, since you are being asked only to decide whether to sign, and the other player has not yet committed, we need to evaluate based on **expected outcomes under the contract**, considering that the contract only activates if both sign.

But **we do not know whether Player 1 will sign**.

But here’s a key insight: the **contract benefits you only if you play A0**, because:
- If you play A0, you get +5
- If you play A1, no change

But in the original game, as we found, the equilibrium is for **you to play A1** (dominant strategy in a way — actually, in the mixed equilibrium, you play A1 with probability 1).

But now, with the contract, **playing A0 becomes more attractive** because of the +5 bonus.

Let’s re-analyze.

---

### Step 4: How does the contract change your incentives?

Suppose **you sign the contract** and the **other player signs it**. Then the contract is active.

Now, the payoffs change:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 (with +5) | A1 |
|---------------------|--------------|----|
| **A0**              | (5 + 5, 5 + 5) = (10, 10) | (0 + 5, 3) = (5, 3) |
| **A1**              | (3, 0 + 5) = (3, 5) | (3, 3) |

Wait: let’s clarify.

The contract says:
- If a player plays A0 → they get +5 **from the other player**
- So the **player** who plays A0 gets +5, the other player loses 5

So the **net change** is that the other player pays 5 to the A0 player.

Therefore, new payoffs (with contract active):

|       | P1: A0       | P1: A1       |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| P2: A0| (5 + 5, 5 + 5) = (10, 10) | (0 + 5, 3 + 0) = (5, 3) ? Wait no.

No: let’s be careful.

The **contract adds 5 to the player who plays A0**, and **subtracts 5 from the other player**.

So if:
- P2 plays A0, P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 + 5 = 10, P1 gets 5 − 5 = 0
- P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0 + 5 = 5, P1 gets 3 − 5 = −2
- P2 plays A1, P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3 − 5 = −2, P1 gets 5 + 5 = 10? Wait no.

Wait, the rule says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- If you (P2) play A0 → you get +5, and the other player (P1) loses 5
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +5, P2 loses 5

So the **net transfer** is only when **that player** plays A0.

So the revised payoffs with contract active:

| P1 \ P2 | A0          | A1          |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **A0** | (5 + 5, 5 − 5) = (10, 0) | (0 + 5, 3 − 5) = (5, −2) |
| **A1** | (3 − 5, 0 + 5) = (−2, 5) | (3, 3) |

Wait — no.

Let’s re-express the contract:

- When P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +5, P1 loses 5
- When P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +5, P2 loses 5

So for each outcome:

1. P1: A0, P2: A0
   - Original: (5,5)
   - P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +5, P2 loses 5
   - P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +5, P1 loses 5
   - Net: P1: 5 + 5 − 5 = 5
   - P2: 5 − 5 + 5 = 5
   - Wait — that’s still (5,5)? That can't be.

Hold on! There's a key issue here.

The contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players."

"Equally from the other players" → but there's only one other player.

So if both players play A0:
- P2 gets +5 (from contract), but P2 also "gives" 5 to P1 (since P1 is the other player, and P2 is paying 5 to draw from other players)
- But P1 also gets +5 (from playing A0), and gives 5 to P2

So net effect: both get +5 and −5 → net 0.

So the *net transfer* between them is zero.

But both get +5 extra from the contract? Then **the contract creates a transfer of 5 from each to the other**?

Wait — no, it's not a transfer *between* them — it's a separate mechanism: every time someone plays A0, they get +5, and the other player loses 5.

But if both play A0, then:
- P2 gets +5 (because playing A0), and loses 5 (because P1 is the other player playing A0), so net: 0
- Similarly, P1 gets +5 from playing A0, loses 5 to P2 → net 0
So total transfer: no net effect.

Similarly:
- If only P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +5, P1 loses 5 → net: P2 gains 5, P1 loses 5
- If only P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +5, P2 loses 5 → net: P1 gains 5, P2 loses 5
- If neither plays A0 → no change

So the contract only causes a **transfer between players** when exactly one plays A0.

But the **magnitude of the transfer** is 5 each way.

But the **net effect** is:

| Outcome          | P2 gets | P1 gets |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| A0, A0           | 5 + 5 − 5 = 5 | 5 + 5 − 5 = 5 |
| A0, A1           | 0 + 5 − 5 = 0 | 3 + 5 − 5 = 3 → wait no

Let’s do it properly.

Original payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (5,5)
- (A0, A1): (0,3)
- (A1, A0): (3,0)
- (A1, A1): (3,3)

Now, add contract effects:

- Whenever a player plays A0, they get +5, the other player loses 5.

So:
1. (A0, A0): both play A0 → both get +5 and lose 5 → net original +0 → (5,5) → no change
2. (A0, A1): P1 A0 → P1 gets +5, P2 loses 5; P2 A1 → no bonus or penalty
   → P1: 3 + 5 = 8, P2: 0 − 5 = −5 → (−5, 8)
3. (A1, A0): P2 A0 → P2 gets +5, P1 loses 5; P1 A1 → no effect
   → P2: 0 + 5 = 5, P1: 3 − 5 = −2 → (5, −2)
4. (A1, A1): no A0 → (3,3)

Wait — no:
- In (A1, A0): P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +5, P1 loses 5
- P1 plays A1 → no effect
- So P2: 0 (base) +5 = 5
- P1: 3 (base) −5 = −2 → (5, −2)

Similarly:
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +5, P2 loses 5
- P2 plays A1 → no effect
- P1: 3 + 5 = 8
- P2: 0 − 5 = −5 → (−5, 8)

And (A0,A0): both get +5 and lose 5 → net 0 → (5,5)

(A1,A1): (3,3)

So revised payoff matrix **with contract active**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0          | A1          |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **A0** | (5, 5)      | (−5, 8)     |
| **A1** | (5, −2)     | (3, 3)      |

Now, this is a **very different game**.

Let’s analyze your best response.

You are Player 2.

If P1 plays A0:
- You play A0 → 5
- You play A1 → −5 → so better to play A0

If P1 plays A1:
- You play A0 → 5
- You play A1 → 3 → still better to play A0

So **A0 is a dominant strategy for you** when the contract is active.

Similarly, for Player 1:
- If you play A0:
  - P1 plays A0 → 5
  - P1 plays A1 → −2 → so better to play A0
- If you play A1:
  - P1 plays A0 → 8
  - P1 plays A1 → 3 → better to play A0

So A0 is also dominant for P1.

Thus, **if the contract is active**, both players will play A0, and outcome is (5,5).

So both get 5.

Recall: in the **original game**, the equilibrium is for you to play A1 with probability 1, and you get 3 points.

If both play A0 with contract, you get 5.

So **you gain by signing the contract**, **provided that the other player also signs**.

But what if the other player does **not** sign?

Then the contract **does not apply**, regardless of your choice.

So:
- If you sign, but P1 doesn't → contract inactive → original payoffs
- If you don't sign → contract inactive → original payoffs

So your choice to sign only matters if **both sign**, and then you get the improved game.

But **you don’t control** whether P1 signs.

But **P1 is the proposer** — they proposed the contract.

Why would they propose a contract that only benefits you if they sign?

Wait — from their perspective, if they sign, and you sign, they get (5,5), same as you.

But in the original game, they could get more?

In original game, if P1 plays A0 with probability 3/5, and you play A1 with probability 1, expected payoff is 3.

But if contract is active, and both play A0, they get 5 → **better**.

So P1 **has an incentive to sign**, because it increases their payoff from 3 to 5.

So **P1 will likely sign the contract**, since it benefits them.

Moreover, the contract is proposed by P1 and selected via approval voting — so they want it to pass.

Therefore, **P1 will sign**.

Now, if P1 signs, and you sign, the contract activates.

If you sign, and P1 doesn’t, contract inactive → same as before.

But since P1 likely signs, and you benefit by signing (you go from 3 → 5), then **you should sign**.

But wait — what if P1 signs but you don’t?

Then contract inactive → you play original game → you get 3.

But if you sign and P1 signs → you get 5.

So **you gain 2 points** by signing, if P1 signs.

And since P1 has incentive to sign, you can expect they will.

But what if you *don’t* sign? Then even if P1 signs, contract inactive.

So you get only 3.

So **you only gain by signing if P1 signs**.

But P1 will only sign if they benefit.

In original game, P1’s expected payoff is 3.

With contract active, they get 5.

So yes, P1 benefits from signing.

In fact, P1’s best response is to play A0 regardless, so they get at least 5.

So P1 will sign.

Therefore, **if you sign, contract activates, you get 5**.

If you don’t sign, even if P1 signs, contract doesn’t activate → you get 3.

So **your optimal action is to sign**.

But wait — could there be a situation where you sign but P1 doesn’t?

But the contract requires **all players to sign**.

So only if **you sign and P1 signs**, it activates.

If you don’t sign, it doesn’t activate.

So to activate, **both must sign**.

But P1, being rational, will sign because they gain from it.

So **P1 signs**.

Now, if P1 signs, and you sign → contract active → you get 5.

If you don’t sign → contract inactive → you get 3.

So **you get more by signing**.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

But wait — is there a risk?

Suppose P1 is **not rational**? But we are to assume rational players.

And the contract benefits P1 unambiguously.

So P1 will sign.

Thus, as long as **you sign**, contract activates, you get 5.

You don’t get anything worse.

So **signing is a strict improvement** if the other player signs, which they will.

Hence, **you should sign**.

Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

The game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P2)**   | (5,5)   | (0,3)   |
| **A1 (P2)**   | (3,0)   | (3,3)   |

We are the **Player 2** in this game.

Let’s define strategies:
- Let $ p $ be the probability that **you** (Player 2) play A0.
- Let $ q $ be the probability that **Player 1** plays A0.

Your expected payoff:

$$
EU_2 = p \cdot q \cdot 5 + p \cdot (1 - q) \cdot 3 + (1 - p) \cdot q \cdot 0 + (1 - p) \cdot (1 - q) \cdot 3
$$

Simplify:

$$
EU_2 = 5pq + 3p(1 - q) + 0 + 3(1 - p)(1 - q)
$$
$$
= 5pq + 3p - 3pq + 3(1 - p - q + pq)
$$
$$
= (5pq - 3pq + 3pq) + 3p + 3 - 3p - 3q
$$
$$
= 5pq + 3 - 3q
$$

Wait — let's recompute carefully:

$$
EU_2 = 5pq + 3p(1 - q) + 0 + 3(1 - p)(1 - q)
$$
$$
= 5pq + 3p - 3pq + 3(1 - p - q + pq)
$$
$$
= (5pq - 3pq + 3pq) + 3p + 3 - 3p - 3q
$$
$$
= 5pq + 3 - 3q
$$

Wait — the terms:

- $3p - 3p = 0$
- So: $5pq - 3pq = 2pq$
- Then: $+ 3pq$ from the last term? No — let's expand fully:

$$
= 5pq + 3p - 3pq + 3(1 - p - q + pq)
= (5pq - 3pq) + 3p + 3 - 3p - 3q + 3pq
= 2pq + 3pq + 3 - 3q
= 5pq + 3 - 3q
$$

Yes — so:

$$
EU_2 = 5pq + 3 - 3q
$$

Now, take derivative w.r.t. $p$ (since you choose $p$):

$$
\frac{dEU_2}{dp} = 5q
$$

This is **positive** for all $q > 0$, so you should set $p = 1$ if $q > 0$. But wait — that seems too strong.

Wait! Let’s double-check the entire calculation using an easier method.

---

### **Better: Use Standard Game Theory to Find Equilibrium**

We can find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let’s define:
- Player 2 (you): mix with probability $p$ on A0.
- Player 1: mix with probability $q$ on A0.

**Player 1’s expected payoff from A0 vs A1:**

- If Player 1 plays A0: payoff = $5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p$
- If Player 1 plays A1: payoff = $3p + 3(1 - p) = 3$

Set equal for indifference: $5p = 3 \Rightarrow p = 0.6$

**Player 2’s expected payoff:**

- If Player 2 plays A0: payoff = $5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q$
- If Player 2 plays A1: payoff = $3q + 3(1 - q) = 3$

Set equal: $5q = 3 \Rightarrow q = 0.6$

So, in symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:
- Both players play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

Expected payoff for each:

$EU = 5 \cdot 0.6 \cdot 0.6 + 0 \cdot 0.6 \cdot 0.4 + 3 \cdot 0.4 \cdot 0.6 + 3 \cdot 0.4 \cdot 0.4$

$$
= 5 \cdot 0.36 + 0 + 3 \cdot 0.24 + 3 \cdot 0.16 = 1.8 + 0.72 + 0.48 = 3.0
$$

So, **expected payoff in equilibrium is 3 points per player** if no contract.

But we now consider **contracts** that modify payoffs.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Contract Effects**

Each contract modifies payoffs based on the action chosen, with transfers between players.

Since **you are Player 2**, you care about how the **contract affects your total expected payoff**.

Contracts are **approved via voting**, and the winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with **maximum approvals**.

Your objective is to **maximize your expected total points**, so you want to:
- Approve contracts that **increase your expected payoff**
- Possibly **refrain from approving** contracts that hurt you or benefit the other player unfairly
- However, because **you vote**, and **multiple contracts can be approved**, and the **winning contract is chosen at random among those with the maximum number of approvals**, your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff across contracts**, but **you want to vote for contracts that are likely to be selected and beneficial to you**.

But **since you don’t know what others will do**, you must assume that you are the only one making decisions — i.e., you need to **choose which contracts to approve based on your own self-interest**.

The key is: **the contract that wins is selected at random from those with the most approvals.** So to increase your chances of a good contract being selected, you should **approve contracts that are beneficial to you**, and **not approve bad ones**.

But note: **if you approve a contract, you increase its approval count**. So to **maximize your expected payoff**, you should **approve only those contracts that are beneficial to you**, **and you should avoid approving ones that are harmful**, because:
- Approving a harmful contract might increase its chance of being selected (if it gets many approvals), which hurts you.
- But since **you only care about the final contract**, and it's chosen randomly from the most-approved ones, you want **your preferred contracts to be approved** and **unfavored ones not to be**.

But here's the catch: **you don't know what others will vote**, so you must assume your **own vote is pivotal** and act accordingly.

However, the problem does **not** say that other players are rational or coordinated — we are just a single player deciding which contracts to approve.

So the safest and best approach is: **approve a contract if and only if it increases your expected payoff in the game, assuming the contract is used**.

Because:
- If the contract is used, you get more or less.
- You can't prevent harm from a contract you don't approve.
- You only care about the **expected outcome**, so approving a contract you **like** (that increases your payoff) increases the chance that it gets selected and you benefit.

But if you approve a contract that is bad for you, it may **reduce** your expected payoff if it gets selected.

So we should **approve only contracts that are beneficial to you**, regardless of how many approvals they get.

But also: **if your approval increases the chance that a good contract wins**, you want to support good contracts.

Since the winning contract is **uniformly random among those with maximum approvals**, you want to:
- Approve contracts that are **good for you**, and
- Not approve contracts that are **bad for you**.

So your vote should reflect your **self-interest**: **approve if and only if the contract improves your expected payoff**.

Let’s now evaluate each contract from **your perspective as Player 2**.

---

## **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So, the **transfer** is:
- If **you** (Player 2) play A0: you get +2, but **Player 1** pays you 2 (since total is split equally between the two players).
- If you play A1: you pay 2, so you lose 2, and Player 1 gets +2.

Let’s formalize the **net effect** on **your payoff**:

### Case 1: You play A0
- You gain **+2** from the contract (bonus for A0).
- Player 1 pays you 2, so you get +2.
- So total contract effect: **+2**
- Your base payoff is unchanged (except for the contract adjustment).

### Case 2: You play A1
- You **pay** 2, so you lose 2.
- Player 1 gains 2.

So your **payoff under contract C1** becomes:

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment | Total Payoff |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| A0          | A0              | 5           | +2                  | 7            |
| A0          | A1              | 0           | +2                  | 2            |
| A1          | A0              | 3           | -2                  | 1            |
| A1          | A1              | 3           | -2                  | 1            |

So the **new payoff matrix**:

|               | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P2)**   | (7, 3)  | (2, 5)  |
| **A1 (P2)**   | (1, 5)  | (1, 5)  |

Wait: Let's compute **Player 2's payoffs** (your payoffs):

- (A2=A0, P1=A0): 5 (base) + 2 (contract A0) = 7
- (A2=A0, P1=A1): 0 (base) + 2 = 2
- (A2=A1, P1=A0): 3 (base) - 2 (contract A1) = 1
- (A2=A1, P1=A1): 3 - 2 = 1

Player 1's payoffs (for completeness):
- (A0,A0): 5 - 2 (you gain 2, they lose 2) → 3? Wait no:

Wait: Contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So **if you choose A0**, you get +2, **and that 2 is taken from the other player**.

Similarly, if you choose A1, you **pay 2**, and **that 2 goes to the other player**.

So **the transfer is: 2 points from the other player to you, if you play A0**.

So net:
- If you play A0: you gain +2, the other player loses 2.
- If you play A1: you lose 2, the other player gains +2.

So yes — the **change in your payoff** is:
- +2 if you play A0
- -2 if you play A1

And **the other player's payoff** changes in the **opposite** way.

So the updated payoff matrix (your payoffs, Player 2):

|               | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P2)**   | 5+2=7   | 0+2=2   |
| **A1 (P2)**   | 3-2=1   | 3-2=1   |

So your payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 7
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A0): 1
- (A1, A1): 1

Now, let's compute your **expected payoff** if you choose strategy $p$ (prob A0), P1 chooses $q$ (prob A0).

$$
EU_2 = 7pq + 2p(1 - q) + 1(1 - p)q + 1(1 - p)(1 - q)
$$
$$
= 7pq + 2p - 2pq + q - pq + 1 - q - p + pq
$$
Wait: expand carefully.

Terms:
- $7pq$
- $2p(1 - q) = 2p - 2pq$
- $1 \cdot (1 - p)q = q - pq$
- $1 \cdot (1 - p)(1 - q) = 1 - p - q + pq$

Add them all:

$$
7pq + 2p - 2pq + q - pq + 1 - p - q + pq
$$

Now combine:
- $pq$: 7 - 2 - 1 + 1 = 5pq
- $p$: 2p - p = p
- $q$: q - q = 0
- Constants: 1

So:
$$
EU_2 = 5pq + p + 1
$$

Now, what value of $p$ maximizes this for a fixed $q$?

Take derivative w.r.t. $p$: $5q + 1$

This is **always positive** (since $q \geq 0$), so your best response is to set $p = 1$ **no matter what $q$ is**.

Thus, **you will always play A0 if contract C1 is in effect**.

So you will play **A0 with probability 1**.

Now, what does Player 1 do?

Player 1’s payoff:
- If P1 plays A0: $3pq + 5p(1 - q)$ → wait no.

Original base payoffs for P1:
- (A0,A0): 5
- (A0,A1): 3
- (A1,A0): 0
- (A1,A1): 3

Now, **contract effect**:
- If P1 plays A0: gains +2
- If P1 plays A1: loses 2

So P1's payoff:
- (A0,A0): 5 + 2 = 7
- (A0,A1): 3 + 2 = 5
- (A1,A0): 0 - 2 = -2
- (A1,A1): 3 - 2 = 1

So P1’s payoff matrix:

|               | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)**   | 7       | 5       |
| **A1 (P1)**   | -2      | 1       |

Now, if you are playing A0 with probability 1, then P1’s expected payoff:

- A0: $7 \cdot 1 = 7$
- A1: $-2 \cdot 1 = -2$

So P1 will play A0 for sure.

So in the **equilibrium under C1**, both play A0.

Your payoff: 7.

Compare to **base game**, where expected payoff was 3.

So under C1, **you get 7** — a big increase.

So C1 is **very good for you**.

Now, is C1 **good for Player 1**? Let’s check.

Player 1’s payoff: 7 (from (A0,A0)) — same as you.

But if they deviate to A1, they get -2.

But base game: 5, now 7 — so **Player 1 also benefits**?

Wait: base game expected payoff was 3, now they get 7? Seems good.

But wait — in the base game, expected payoff is 3. That was under equilibrium.

But under C1, both play A0, so Player 1 gets 7 — **much better**.

But is Player 1 indifferent? They are clearly better off.

But **Player 1 proposed C1**, so they like it.

So C1 is **mutually beneficial**?

Wait — but look: the contract **punishes A1**, which is good for the cooperative outcome.

In fact, this contract **makes A0 dominate A1** for both players.

So yes, **C1 benefits both**.

But we are only concerned with **your payoff**.

You get **7**, which is much better than 3.

So **you should approve C1**.

---

## **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2 (You)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So contract effect:

- If you play A0 → you get +1 (from other player)
- If you play A1 → you pay 2 (to other player)

So net change to your payoff:
- A0: +1
- A1: -2

So your new payoff matrix:

|               | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P2)**   | 5+1=6   | 0+1=1   |
| **A1 (P2)**   | 3-2=1   | 3-2=1   |

Same as before, but now:
- When you play A0 and P1 plays A0: 6
- When you play A0 and P1 plays A1: 1
- When you play A1: 1 in both cases

So your expected payoff:

$$
EU_2 = 6pq + 1p(1 - q) + 1(1 - p)q + 1(1 - p)(1 - q)
$$

$$
= 6pq + p - pq + q - pq + 1 - p - q + pq
$$

Combine:
- $pq$: 6 - 1 - 1 + 1 = 5pq
- $p$: p - p = 0
- $q$: q - q = 0
- constant: 1

So:
$$
EU_2 = 5pq + 1
$$

Now, derivative w.r.t. $p$: $5q$

Again, **always positive**, so you will play A0 with probability 1.

Now, what does Player 1 do?

P1’s base payoffs:
- A0: 5 if opponent A0, 3 if opponent A1
- A1: 0 if opponent A0, 3 if opponent A1

Contract:
- P1 gets +1 if they play A0
- P1 pays 2 if they play A1

So P1’s payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 5 + 1 = 6
- (A0,A1): 3 + 1 = 4
- (A1,A0): 0 - 2 = -2
- (A1,A1): 3 - 2 = 1

So P1’s matrix:

|               | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)**   | 6       | 4       |
| **A1 (P1)**   | -2      | 1       |

If you play A0 (which you do), P1’s options:
- A0: 6
- A1: -2

So P1 will play A0.

So equilibrium: both play A0.

Your payoff: 6.

Compared to base game: 3 → better.

But compared to C1: C1 gives you 7, which is better.

So **C2 gives you 6**, C1 gives you **7**.

So **C1 is better than C2** for you.

But both are better than base.

Now: should you approve C2?

Yes — because it **gives you 6**, which is better than the base 3.

But you must ask: is it **worth approving**?

Yes — because if C2 is approved and wins, you get 6.

If you don’t approve, it may not get selected.

But you are only approving if it benefits you.

Both C1 and C2 are better for you than base.

But here’s the **crucial point**: you are **the proposer of C2**, and it's **designed to help you**.

But from your perspective: **C2 is good for you**.

So you should approve it.

But wait — could **not approving C2** be strategic?

Suppose you **don’t approve C2**, but C1 is approved by others.

Then C1 might get many approvals and be selected.

But **if you don’t approve C2**, C2 has 0 approvals, so it can't win.

But you **don’t care** about C2 winning if it's worse than C1.

But **you** are **player 2**, and you are **proposing C2**.

You **want to get benefits**.

So **if C2 is approved by you**, it gets at least 1 approval.

If others approve it, it can compete.

But you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

So **if C1 is better than C2**, but both are better than base, then you should **approve both**, so that **C1 has a chance** to win (and you get 7) and **C2 also survives**.

But if you **don’t approve C2**, it’s eliminated.

But since C1 is better for you, **you benefit more from C1 being selected**.

So you **should still approve C2** — because it **might help** if C1 fails.

But wait: **if you approve C2, you increase its approval count, which increases its chance of being selected**.

But if C2 is worse for you than C1, and **C1 is better**, then **you don't want C2 to be selected**.

But if you approve C2, you support a **worse contract**.

So you **should not approve C2** because it gives you less than C1.

But **C2 is still better than base**.

But if **C1 is available and better**, and **you approve C1**, then C1 might get high approval.

But if **C2 is not approved by you**, then C2 has **low chance** to win.

But if you **approve C2**, you give it **a chance to win**, which is bad — because you get less if it wins.

Therefore: **You should only approve contracts that are beneficial to you.**

But **C2 is beneficial** — gives you 6 vs base 3.

But if **C1 is also approved**, and C1 is better, then **the winning contract is chosen at random from the ones with maximum approval**.

So suppose **C1 gets 5 approvals**, C2 gets 1 (yours), then C1 wins.

Suppose **C1 gets 1 approval**, C2 gets 2, then C2 wins.

But if you **approve C2**, you’re helping a worse contract.

So **you should not approve C2** if C1 is available and better.

But **C1 is proposed by Player 1**, so not you.

But you can still approve it.

You must decide: should you approve C2?

Let’s suppose that **C1 is approved by Player 1 and possibly others**, and **you approve C1**.

Then C1 has high approval count.

If you **also approve C2**, then C2 gets 1 approval.

So C1 is still the best.

But if **C1 is rejected**, and C2 is approved by you, then C2 might win.

But **you don’t want to approve C2 unless it’s the best**.

But **C2 is not the best** — C1 is better.

So **you should only approve C1**.

But **approval is independent** — you can approve both, but if you do, you're helping a **worse contract**.

So **if you approve C2**, you risk that C2 wins, which gives you 6 instead of 7.

So **you lose expected payoff**.

Hence: **you should not approve C2**.

But wait — is that correct?

Let’s model expectations.

Suppose:
- You approve C1.
- You **do not approve** C2.

Then C1 is approved by you and perhaps others.
C2 has 0 approval.

So the maximum approval is at least 1 (from you), and C1 wins with probability 1.

You get 7.

If you **approve C2**, then C2 gets 1 approval.
C1 still gets at least 1.

Suppose C1 gets total approval count = k, C2 gets 1.

Then:
- If k ≥ 2, then C1 is the *maximum* (possibly tied), so C1 wins with high probability.
- If k = 1, then C1 and C2 are tied at 1, so the winner is chosen uniformly at random: 50% C1, 50% C2.

So your expected payoff: 0.5 * 7 + 0.5 * 6 = 3.5 + 3 = 6.5 < 7.

So **you are worse off**.

Thus, **by approving C2, you reduce your expected payoff**.

Therefore, **you should NOT approve C2**.

Even though C2 is better than base, you should not approve it because it **competes** with a superior contract (C1), and **your approval increases the chance that a suboptimal contract wins**.

You **only want to approve contracts that are the best**, or that **you have no reason to oppose**.

But since C1 is better than C2, and C2 is worse, **you should not approve C2**.

Wait — but **what if no other player approves C1**?

Then C1 gets 1 approval (yours), C2 gets 1 approval (yours), so both are tied at 1.

Then winner: 50% chance of C1, 50% C2.

Expected payoff: 6.5 < 7 — still worse than not approving C2.

So even in that case, you’re worse off.

Therefore, **approving C2 reduces your expected payoff** — so you should **not approve it**.

But what about if C2 is **the only contract**? Then you must approve it to get any benefit.

But here, **C1 exists and is better**.

So you should **only approve C1**.

But is there **any reason to approve C2**?

Only if it **increases the total expected payoff**, but **you can’t** — the only impact is on which contract wins, and **C1 is better**.

So **you should not approve C2**.

But let’s confirm: what if **no one else approves C1**?

Still, if you approve C1 and C2, then:
- C1 has 1 approval
- C2 has 1 approval
- Winner: 50% C1, 50% C2
- Expected payoff: 6.5 < 7

But if you **approves only C1**, and others don’t approve C1, then C1 still has 1 approval, C2 has 0 → C1 wins.

You get 7.

So in both cases, **approving C2 is strictly worse**.

Therefore: **you should NOT approve C2**.

But **C2 is proposed by you**, so you might think you should support yourself.

But **your goal is to maximize your expected points**, not to support your own proposal.

If supporting your proposal reduces your expected payoff, you should not do it.

So final decision:

- **C1**: approve → because it gives you 7, better than base.
- **C2**: do not approve → because it gives you only 6, and its approval risks selecting it, reducing your expected payoff.

But wait — one more thing.

What if **C1 is not approved by others**, and you approve C1, but not C2 — then C1 wins (1 approval).

You get 7.

If you **approve C2**, and not C1, then C2 wins (1 approval) → you get 6.

Worse.

So in all scenarios, **approving C2 is worse**.

But you **must** approve or reject each contract.

So conclusion:

You should approve **C1** and **not approve C2**.

But wait — what if **C1 is rejected by everyone except you**?

Then C1 has 1 approval, C2 has 1 (your approval) → both have 1, so winner is randomly picked between them → 50% chance of 7, 50% chance of 6 → 6.5.

If you **don’t approve C2**, then C2 has 0, C1 has 1 → C1 wins → 7.

So **you are better off not approving C2**.

Thus, **never approve C2**.

Even though it's proposed by you, it's worse than C1.

So final answer:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}
```

But wait — let’s check if C2 could be approved **if C1 were worse**.

But C1 is better.

So yes.

One last thing: are both contracts actually beneficial?

We said C1 gives you 7, C2 gives you 6 — yes.

And **C1 is a better deal**.

So **approve only C1**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

## Step-by-step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the basic game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)
- (Me: A0, Other: A0) → I get 5 points
- (Me: A0, Other: A1) → I get 0 points  
- (Me: A1, Other: A0) → I get 3 points
- (Me: A1, Other: A1) → I get 3 points

### Step 2: Apply the contract modification
The contract states: If a player chooses A1, they pay 4 points to the other player.

Modified payoffs for me (Player 2):
- **(Me: A0, Other: A0)** → 5 + 0 = **5 points**
  - No penalties
  
- **(Me: A0, Other: A1)** → 0 + 4 = **4 points**
  - Other player pays me 4 for choosing A1
  
- **(Me: A1, Other: A0)** → 3 - 4 = **-1 points**
  - I pay 4 for choosing A1
  
- **(Me: A1, Other: A1)** → 3 - 4 + 4 = **3 points**
  - I pay 4, but receive 4 from the other player (net 0 from contract)

### Step 3: Determine dominance
Let me compare my payoffs:

**If Other player chooses A0:**
- My A0 gives me: 5 points
- My A1 gives me: -1 points
- **A0 is better (5 > -1)**

**If Other player chooses A1:**
- My A0 gives me: 4 points
- My A1 gives me: 3 points
- **A0 is better (4 > 3)**

### Step 4: Conclusion
**A0 strictly dominates A1** - regardless of what the other player does, I always get more points by choosing A0.

The contract successfully penalizes A1 choices enough to make A0 the dominant strategy. Since rational Player 1 will also recognize that A0 dominates (the game is symmetric after the contract), both players should choose A0.

### Optimal Strategy
Choose A0 with certainty.

Let's analyze this step by step.

---

### **1. Understand the Base Payoff (Without Contract)**

The base game is a symmetric coordination game with some elements of prisoner's dilemma.

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Payoff | Other's Payoff |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5           | 5              |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3              |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0              |
| A1          | A1                     | 3           | 3              |

This is **not** a standard prisoner's dilemma (where mutual defection is worse than mutual cooperation), but rather a **coordination game with a preference for A0**.

- If both choose A0: 5,5
- If both choose A1: 3,3
- If you play A0 and they play A1: you get 0, they get 3 → bad for you
- If you play A1 and they play A0: you get 3, they get 0 → good for you

So A0 is better if you expect the other to play A0 (high reward), but risky if the other plays A1 (you get 0).

But remember: **You are Player 2**, and the contract is designed such that **Player 1 proposed the payment contract**.

---

### **2. Understand the Payment Contract**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players.

Important implications:

- **Choosing A0 earns you +5 points**, but this comes **from the other player**.
- So, **the cost of your +5 points is deducted from the other player's payoff**.
- If you choose A0: +5 to you, −5 from the other player.
- If you choose A1: no additional payment.

> **Note:** The contract says "drawn equally from the other players". Since there is only one other player, it means "from the other player".

So, **the contract redistributes 5 points from the opponent to you** when you play A0.

This makes choosing A0 **more attractive**, because you effectively get:

- Base payoff (from game) + 5 (from contract)

But the other player loses 5.

Let’s update the **total payoff** for Player 2 (you) under the contract.

---

### **3. Update Payoffs with Contract (You are Player 2)**

We now compute Player 2’s **total payoff** (base + contract) for each outcome.

Let’s denote:
- Your action (Player 2): A0 or A1
- Other player’s action (Player 1): A0 or A1

#### **Case 1: You (P2) choose A0, Player 1 chooses A0**

- Base payoff (P2): 5
- Contract: You get +5 (from P1)
- **Total P2 payoff: 5 + 5 = 10**
- P1: base 5, loses 5 → 0

#### **Case 2: You (P2) choose A0, Player 1 chooses A1**

- Base payoff (P2): 0
- Contract: You get +5
- **Total P2 payoff: 0 + 5 = 5**
- P1: base 3, loses 5 → −2

#### **Case 3: You (P2) choose A1, Player 1 chooses A0**

- Base payoff (P2): 3
- Contract: You choose A1 → no +5
- **Total P2 payoff: 3**
- P1: base 0, no loss → 0 (you don’t lose anything, but P1 doesn't gain from contract)

> Wait: The contract says: “If a player chooses A0, they receive +5 drawn from other players.” So only the **A0 choosers** get the +5.

So if you choose A1, you get **no extra**, and **no penalty**.

P1 gets nothing extra in this case either (since they chose A0, but you chose A1, so the gain goes to P1, but from P2? Let's clarify.)

Actually, the contract is:

> “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”

So:
- Each A0 choice results in 5 points **from the other player**.
- So if **you** choose A0 → you get +5 from **P1**
- If **P1** chooses A0 → P1 gets +5 from **you**

So in case 3:
- You (P2) choose A1 → no contract benefit
- P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +5 from **you**, so you lose 5

But your base payoff is **3**, and now you lose 5 from contract → **your total payoff = 3 - 5 = -2**

Wait — is that right?

Yes! The contract says **the 5 points are drawn from the other players** — so if P1 chooses A0, then P1 gains 5, which comes from **you**.

So every time **P1** chooses A0, **you (P2)** pay 5 to P1.

Similarly, every time **you** choose A0, **P1** pays you 5 → so you gain 5.

Therefore, the **contract is a direct transfer** based on your choice.

So update:

---

### **Revised Payoffs (Player 2's total payoff)**

| P2 Action | P1 Action | Base Payoff (P2) | Contract Effect (P2) | **Total P2 Payoff** |
|----------|----------|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| A0       | A0       | 5                | +5 (from P1)           | **10**              |
| A0       | A1       | 0                | +5 (from P1)           | **5**               |
| A1       | A0       | 3                | -5 (to P1)             | **-2**              |
| A1       | A1       | 3                | 0                      | **3**               |

> Important: The contract applies **regardless of what the other player does**. It’s based on **your own choice**.

So:

- Choosing A0 → +5 from other player.
- Choosing A1 → no gain/loss from contract.

Thus, **your total payoff** is:
> Base payoff + (5 if you chose A0) - (5 if the other player chose A0)

Why subtract 5 when P1 chooses A0? Because **P1 receives 5 from you** when P1 chooses A0.

So yes — if P1 chooses A0, **you lose 5**, even if you chose A1.

Similarly, if you choose A0, **you gain 5**, regardless of what P1 does.

So the correct formula for your total payoff is:

> **P2 Total Payoff = Base Payoff + 5 × [1 if you chose A0 else 0] - 5 × [1 if P1 chose A0 else 0]**

Let’s tabulate again with this in mind.

#### Final Payoff Table (P2 total):

| Your (P2) | P1 | Base | Contract Gain (A0) | Contract Loss (P1 A0) | Total |
|----------|----|------|---------------------|------------------------|-------|
| A0       | A0 | 5    | +5                  | −5                     | 5+5−5 = **5** |
| A0       | A1 | 0    | +5                  | 0                      | **5** |
| A1       | A0 | 3    | 0                   | −5                     | **−2** |
| A1       | A1 | 3    | 0                   | 0                      | **3** |

Wait! This contradicts the earlier calculation.

Let’s be precise.

- **Contract rule**: When a player chooses A0, they gain +5 from the other player.

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you gain +5 (from P1)
- If **P1** chooses A0 → you lose −5 (you pay 5 to P1)

So in **Case 1 (A0 vs A0)**:
- You: base 5, gain +5 (from A0), lose −5 (P1's A0) → 5 + 5 − 5 = **5**

→ **Not 10**, that’s a mistake earlier!

Similarly:
- Case 2 (A0 vs A1):
  - You: base 0, gain +5 (you chose A0), P1 chose A1 → no loss → 0 + 5 = **5**
- Case 3 (A1 vs A0):
  - You: base 3, you chose A1 → no gain, but P1 chose A0 → you lose −5 → 3 − 5 = **−2**
- Case 4 (A1 vs A1):
  - You: base 3, no gain, no loss → **3**

So the **correct total payoff matrix (for you, Player 2)** is:

| P2 \ P1 | A0     | A1     |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A0     | **5**  | **5**  |
| A1     | **-2** | **3**  |

Let’s double-check:

- (A0, A0): you get 5 (base) +5 (you chose A0) −5 (P1 chose A0) = 5 → ✔️
- (A0, A1): you get 0 +5 (you chose A0) −0 (P1 didn't choose A0) = 5 → ✔️
- (A1, A0): 3 +0 −5 = −2 → ✔️
- (A1, A1): 3 +0 −0 = 3 → ✔️

Yes.

So now, **your expected payoff depends on your strategy**, and **P1’s strategy**.

But now: we must **choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1** to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming P1 is also rational and will also optimize their own payoff (but P1 is the one who proposed the contract, so they may have strategic advantages).

---

### **4. Understand Player 1's Incentives**

Player 1 proposed the contract. They are also rational.

Let’s compute Player 1’s total payoff under the contract.

For P1:
- Base payoff:
  - (A0 vs A0): 5
  - (A0 vs A1): 3
  - (A1 vs A0): 0
  - (A1 vs A1): 3
- Plus:
  - If P1 chooses A0 → +5 from P2
  - If P2 chooses A0 → P1 loses 5

So P1’s total payoff = Base + 5×[P1 chose A0] - 5×[P2 chose A0]

So let’s compute P1’s payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0     | A1     |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A0     | 5 +5 −5 = **5** | 3 +5 −0 = **8** |
| A1     | 0 +0 −5 = **-5** | 3 +0 −0 = **3** |

So P1’s payoffs:

- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 8
- (A1, A0): -5
- (A1, A1): 3

So for P1, choosing A0 gives:
- 5 if P2 plays A0
- 8 if P2 plays A1 → much better!

But if P2 plays A0, P1 loses 5 (because P2 chose A0), so P1 gets only 5.

But if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 8.

So **P1 prefers A0 when P2 plays A1**, but gets only 5 when P2 plays A0.

But P1 also gets **+5** if they play A0, so even when they lose money to P2, they're still better off playing A0 if P2 plays optimally.

Wait — actually, we now see the **strategic structure**.

P1’s best responses:

- If P2 plays A0: P1’s payoffs:
  - A0: 5
  - A1: -5 → so P1 prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1’s payoffs:
  - A0: 8
  - A1: 3 → so P1 prefers A0

So **P1 always prefers A0**, regardless of what P2 does.

Therefore, **P1 will choose A0 with probability 1**, no matter what.

Because:
- Even if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 5 from A0, vs −5 from A1 → better to play A0.
- If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 8 from A0, 3 from A1 → still better.

So **rational P1 will always play A0**.

This is **critical**.

So even though the contract is disadvantageous in some cases, for P1, playing A0 is **dominated strategy**.

✅ **P1 will always play A0.**

---

### **5. Your Strategy: Given P1 always plays A0**

Since P1 will **always** play A0, you can condition your strategy on that.

Now, compute your expected payoff for each action (A0 or A1), knowing P1 plays A0:

- If you play A0: payoff = 5 (from earlier table)
- If you play A1: payoff = -2 (from table)

So:
- Choose A0 → 5 points
- Choose A1 → -2 points

Therefore, **you should choose A0 with probability 1**.

But wait — is that the only option?

But you are a rational player choosing a **probability distribution** over actions.

Since you want to **maximize expected payoff**, and:

- Playing A0 gives you 5
- Playing A1 gives you -2

→ You should play A0 with 100% probability.

But wait — what if you randomize? Let’s check.

Suppose you play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)

P1 plays A0 with probability 1.

Your expected payoff:

= p × (payoff A0 vs A0) + (1−p) × (payoff A1 vs A0)
= p × 5 + (1−p) × (−2)
= 5p − 2 + 2p
= 7p − 2

This is **increasing in p** → so maximum at p = 1 → expected payoff = 7×1 − 2 = 5

So indeed, you should set p = 1.

---

### **6. Final Decision**

You should choose A0 with probability 100%, A1 with 0%.

Even though the contract gives you +5 if you choose A0, but also costs you 5 if P1 chooses A0 — but P1 **always** chooses A0, so:

- When you choose A0: you gain +5 (contract), lose −5 (because P1 did A0), so net from contract: 0 → but base payoff is 5 → total 5
- When you choose A1: base payoff 3, but you lose −5 (because P1 chose A0) → total −2

So A0 is better.

Even though the **contract** makes A0 seem more tempting, the **cost** of P1 choosing A0 (which they always do) offsets the benefit.

But in this case, the A0 outcome still gives you 5 vs −2 for A1.

So **your best pure strategy is A0**.

Let's break this down step by step to determine whether you should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

First, analyze the game without the contract.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2; you are Player 2):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | 5,5    | 0,3    |
| **P2: A1**    | 3,0    | 3,3    |

This is a variant of a coordination game with a twist: both players prefer to coordinate on (A0, A0) for 5 points each, but if one chooses A0 and the other A1, the A1 player gets 3 and the A0 player gets 0.

Now, let’s find the Nash equilibria.

- (A0, A0): Both get 5 – if either deviates, they get 0 (if P2 deviates to A1 while P1 plays A0) or 3 (if P1 deviates). So both have incentive to stay. (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): Both get 3. If P2 deviates to A0 while P1 plays A1, P2 gets 0 → worse. Similarly for P1. So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): P2 gets 3, P1 gets 0. P2 is happy, P1 wants to switch to A0 → so not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 0, P1 gets 3. P2 wants to switch to A1 → not equilibrium.

So, two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). There's also a mixed strategy equilibrium, but let’s keep that in mind.

However, the key insight is: **(A0, A0)** is the most efficient outcome (total 10 points), while (A1, A1) is worse (total 6 points). But unless players coordinate, they might end up in (A1, A1).

Now, the **contract** is proposed.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

The contract says:

- If you choose **A0**, you get an additional **+2 points**, drawn **equally from the other player(s)**.
- If you choose **A1**, you pay an additional **-2 points**, **distributed equally to the other player(s)**.

Since there are only two players, "equally from the other players" means:
- If you play A0 → you gain +2, and the other player **loses 2**.
- If you play A1 → you lose 2, and the other player **gains 2**.

So this is a **transfer**: it redistributes points between players based on your action.

Let’s now compute the **new payoff matrix** under the contract, and consider whether you should sign it.

BUT — **you need to decide whether to sign the contract**.

The contract only takes effect if **all players sign**. So you must evaluate whether signing the contract increases your expected utility, **assuming the other player may also sign or not**.

But since this is a game where **both players simultaneously decide** whether to sign, and you're trying to maximize your own points, you must reason about the **possible outcomes depending on the signing decision**.

Let’s analyze **all combination of signing decisions**.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Outcomes Based on Signing

We consider four scenarios:

1. **You sign, P1 signs** → contract active.
2. **You sign, P1 does not sign** → contract inactive.
3. **You do not sign, P1 signs** → contract inactive.
4. **You do not sign, P1 does not sign** → contract inactive.

Note: Only when **both** sign is the contract active.

So, in cases 2, 3, and 4, **no contract** applies.

Only in case 1 does the contract apply.

Now, we must compute your **expected payoff** in each scenario, depending on the strategies chosen.

But here’s the key: **after your decision to sign or not, you and the other player simultaneously choose probabilities for A0 and A1.** The decision to sign affects only the **payoff structure**, not the action choices directly.

So your choice to sign alters the payoff matrix **if the contract is active**.

But since the other player also gets to sign, you must **anticipate** their choices.

However, the problem does **not** specify what the other player will do. So we must make rational assumptions.

Let’s suppose that **both players are rational and self-interested**.

So you need to ask:
- If you sign, what is the likely outcome?
- If you don't sign, what is the likely outcome?
- Which gives you higher expected points?

Let’s proceed.

---

### Step 4: Analyze Payoff Matrix with Contract (If Signed)

Suppose **both sign the contract** → contract applies.

Then, for each outcome, we **add** the contract effects:

| P1 \ P2 | A0   | A1   |
|---------|------|------|
| **A0**  | 5+2, 5-2 = 7,3 | 0-2, 3+2 = -2,5 |
| **A1**  | 3+2, 0-2 = 5,-2 | 3-2, 3+2 = 1,5 |

Wait: careful.

Let’s clarify:

- Contract applies **per player**, based on **their own action**.
- So, whenever a player chooses A0 → they gain +2, and other player loses 2.
- If a player chooses A1 → they lose 2, other player gains 2.

So total payoffs are:

- (A0, A0):  
  - P1: 5 + 2 (from A0) = 7  
  - P2: 5 + 2 (from A0) = 7  
  → But wait: the contract says the **player who chooses A0** gets +2, **paid by the other**. So each gets +2. But where does the money come from?

Here's the issue: **if both choose A0**, then:

- P1 gets +2 (from contract), paid by P2
- P2 gets +2 (from contract), paid by P1

But P1 loses 2 to P2, P2 loses 2 to P1 → **net, both gain 2**.

So total money inflow is zero: each pays 2 and gets 2, so net +2 for each.

So the **contract is self-financing**? But that’s impossible unless external cash.

But the problem says: "drawn equally from the other players".

But if both play A0, then each player gets +2 from the contract **and** pays 2 to the other.

So net: each gains 2.

Similarly, if both play A1: each loses 2.

So total: -4 overall.

This suggests the contract **creates or destroys money**, depending on actions.

But the problem says “drawn equally from the other players”. So if you play A0, you get +2, and the other player(s) collectively lose 2.

If you play A1, you pay 2, so other player(s) collectively gain 2.

Thus:

**In (A0, A0):**
- P1: 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7
- P2: 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7
→ Total: 14

**In (A0, A1):**
- P1 plays A0 → gets +2, so total: 5 + 2 = 7? But P2 plays A1 → pays 2 to others → so P2 gets 3 - 2 = 1, and P1 gets 0 (base) + 2 (from contract) - 2 (paid to P2)? No.

Wait, we must re-think.

The contract is **not a side payment**; it’s **applied after** the base payoff. So:

- P1 gets: base payoff + (contract bonus/penalty based on P1’s action)
- P2 gets: base payoff + (contract bonus/penalty based on P2’s action)

But the **money is extracted from or distributed to the other player(s)**.

So when P1 plays A0, P1 gets +2, and P2 loses 2.

When P1 plays A1, P1 loses 2, and P2 gains 2.

Similarly for P2.

Therefore, net flow is: for each player, their contract adjustment depends only on their own action.

So the total payoff to each player is:

**Player_i payoff = Base payoff + (2 if player_i played A0, -2 if player_i played A1)**

Let’s compute.

#### Contracted Payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2 gets +2) | A1 (P2 gets -2) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **A0 (P1 gets +2)** | P1: 5 + 2 = 7, P2: 5 + 2 = 7 → **(7,7)** | P1: 0 + 2 = 2, P2: 3 - 2 = 1 → **(2,1)** |
| **A1 (P1 gets -2)** | P1: 3 - 2 = 1, P2: 0 + 2 = 2 → **(1,2)** | P1: 3 - 2 = 1, P2: 3 - 2 = 1 → **(1,1)** |

Wait, let’s verify:

- (A0, A0): both get +2 → P1:5+2=7, P2:5+2=7 → (7,7)
- (A0, A1): P1: A0 → +2 (from contract), base = 0 → total 2; P2: A1 → -2, base = 3 → 1 → (2,1)
- (A1, A0): P1: A1 → -2, base = 3 → 1; P2: A0 → +2, base = 0 → 2 → (1,2)
- (A1, A1): both -2 → P1: 3-2=1, P2:3-2=1 → (1,1)

So the new matrix under contract is:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | 7,7 | 2,1 |
| **A1** | 1,2 | 1,1 |

Now, this is a **very different game**.

Let’s find equilibria.

- (A0, A0): 7,7 → if P1 deviates to A1, gets 1 < 7 → won’t deviate; same for P2. So it’s a Nash equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): 1,1 → if P1 deviates to A0, gets 2 > 1 → so P1 wants to deviate → not equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 1 → P1 could deviate to A1 and get 1, not better. But P2: gets 1, deviates to A0 → gets 7? But P1 is still A0 → if P2 switches to A0, gets 7 → YES! P2 wants to deviate. So not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 2, deviates to A1 → P1 still A1 → gets 1 < 2 → no. P1 gets 1, deviates to A0 → gets 2 > 1 → wants to deviate.

So **only pure equilibrium** is (A0, A0), where both get 7.

Even better: **(A0, A0)** is strictly dominant for both?

Let’s check: if the other plays A0:
- If you play A0: get 7
- If you play A1: get 1 → worse
So A0 better

If the other plays A1:
- You play A0: get 2
- You play A1: get 1 → still better to play A0

So **A0 is strictly dominant strategy for both players under the contract**.

So if the contract is active, **both players will play A0**, and both get **7 points**.

---

### Step 5: Without Contract

Now, if the contract is **not active**, we go back to the original game:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | 5,5 | 0,3 |
| **A1** | 3,0 | 3,3 |

As we saw earlier, two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Now, (A0, A0) gives 5 each. (A1, A1) gives 3 each.

But if neither player signs, and both are rational, **they might end up in (A1, A1)** — a risky coordination failure.

In fact, in such games, unless there is **pre-play communication** or **convention**, players might not coordinate on (A0, A0) due to the fear of being exploited.

The mixed strategy equilibrium?

Let’s find it.

Let P1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1-p.

P2 play A0 with probability q, A1 with 1-q.

You are Player 2.

For P2: expected payoff of playing A0:
= p * 5 + (1-p) * 0 = 5p

Expected payoff of playing A1:
= p * 3 + (1-p) * 3 = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5

Similarly, for P1 to be indifferent: q must be such that P1 gets same from A0 and A1.

P1’s payoff for A0: q*5 + (1-q)*0 = 5q

For A1: q*3 + (1-q)*3 = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5

So mixed strategy: both play A0 with probability 3/5.

Then expected payoff for each:

P2: if plays A0: 5*(3/5) = 3
If plays A1: 3 (always)

So expected payoff = 3

But this is **worse than 5**.

In practice, **rational players** might **coordinate** on (A0, A0) if they can. But if not, they might play (A1, A1), especially if A1 is seen as a safer choice.

But since 5 > 3, why would they play A1?

The risk is: if you play A0, and the other plays A1, you get 0.

If you play A1, you get 3 regardless.

So in the absence of trust, **playing A1 is a safe bet**.

Thus, without contract, **the equilibrium outcome is ambiguous**, but **(A1, A1) is a stable outcome**, while (A0, A0) requires coordination.

Given that, **if you sign the contract**, and the other player signs, then **you are guaranteed (A0, A0)** and both get 7.

But if **you sign, but P1 does not sign**, then the contract is **not active**, so payoffs are original.

Similarly, if you don’t sign, even if P1 does, the contract doesn’t apply.

So your options:

- If you **sign**, and P1 signs → you get **7** (from (A0, A0) under contract)
- If you **sign**, and P1 does **not** sign → contract inactive → you are in the original game, where you might get less if they play A1.

But if you sign and P1 doesn’t sign, then you are playing the original game, but **you are committed to the contract condition?** No.

The contract only applies **if both sign**.

So if you sign but P1 doesn’t, **you get no contract bonus**, and you are in the original game.

Similarly, if you don’t sign, even if P1 signs, you get no benefit.

So the **only way** to benefit and change the game is **if you both sign**.

Now, **if you sign**, what will P1 do? P1 is rational.

P1 will compare:
- If P1 signs, and you sign → P1 gets 7
- If P1 signs, but you don’t sign → contract inactive → P1 plays original game, and if you play A0 with some probability, P1’s payoff depends.

But **P1 does not know whether you sign** until the end.

We need to model this as a **simultaneous sign decision**.

So here’s the key: **you can only benefit if both sign**.

But if you sign, and P1 does not sign, **you get no benefit** and **you are still in original game**.

But you might be worse off?

Wait: **if you sign**, but contract doesn't apply, is there any cost?

The contract says: “the other player” pays you 2 if you play A0, or you pay them 2 if you play A1 — but only **if the contract is active**.

So if the contract doesn’t activate (because not both signed), then **no transfer happens**, so your action doesn’t affect the other’s points via contract.

So in **only if both sign**, the contract affects.

Thus, **signing the contract has no cost if it doesn’t activate** — you just get the original game.

But: **if you sign**, and the other player **does not**, you are in the base game.

But: **you might be seen as more cooperative**, and if P1 is rational, they might be more likely to play A0.

But the problem is: you can't observe P1’s signature until after.

So **we must assume both choose simultaneously**.

Now, let’s model the **expected outcome under different signing choices**.

---

### Step 6: Rational Decision to Sign

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their own expected payoff.

You consider:

**Option 1: Do not sign**

Then, contract is inactive no matter what.

You and P1 play the **original game**.

What happens?

- (A0, A0): 5,5
- (A1, A1): 3,3
- No other equilibria (mixed gives 3, which is worse for both)

If **both are rational and can coordinate**, they might play (A0, A0) → you get 5.

But if not, they might play (A1, A1) → you get 3.

**But what is more likely?**

Given that (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium and safe, and (A0, A0) requires trust, **in many such games, players end up in (A1, A1)** due to risk aversion.

So your expected payoff, **if you don’t sign**, is **at most 5**, but could be as low as 3.

**Option 2: Sign the contract**

Now, you only get the benefit if **P1 also signs**.

But if you sign, **P1 will also be rational**.

What does P1 gain from signing?

If P1 signs, and you sign → P1 gets 7 (from (A0, A0))

If P1 signs but you don’t → contract inactive → P1 is in original game.

So P1 will only sign if **they expect to get better than without signing**.

But if **you sign**, then P1 knows that **if they sign, both get 7**

If they don't sign, then play original game — P1 might get 5 or 3.

So **P1 will want to sign if they believe you will sign**.

And if **P1 signs**, and you sign, then both get 7.

But **can you convince P1 to sign?**

Since both are rational, **you can predict** that:

- If both sign → both get 7
- If only one signs → contract inactive → both play original game.

Now, suppose you sign.

Then P1's best response:
- If you sign, and P1 signs → P1 gets 7
- If you sign, but P1 does not → P1 plays original game. What do they get?

In the original game, if the other plays A0 with high probability (because you might be cooperating), P1’s best is to play A0.

But P1 is rational: **if they believe you will play A0, then P1 should play A0** → get 5.

But if P1 plays A0, and you play A0, they get 5 — but **if P1 signs**, they get **7**, so **P1 will want to sign**.

Similarly, if P1 signs, they are committed to the contract and will play A0 (since it’s dominant).

So **if you sign, P1 knows that:**
- If they sign → they get 7
- If they don’t → they play original game; but given you signed, they believe you might play A0, so they might get 5 or less.

So **P1 prefers to sign** to get 7.

Similarly, **you prefer to sign**, because if you do, P1 will sign too → you get 7.

Therefore, **the equilibrium outcome is: both sign, both play A0, both get 7**.

But is this stable?

Yes: because **if you don’t sign**, you get at best 5 in original game (if P1 plays A0), but if you sign, you get 7 (if P1 also signs) — and P1 will sign because they also get 7.

So **signing is strictly better** than not signing, **assuming the other player is rational**.

Even if not, **signing gives you a higher payoff under the best-case coordination**, and **you force coordination on A0**, which is better than the possible 3 in (A1, A1).

Moreover, **there is no downside to signing** — the contract only activates if both sign, so no cost in signing.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

---

### Final Answer

You should sign the contract because:
- It ensures that both players will play A0 (due to dominant strategy under contract).
- Both get 7 points — better than the 5 in (A0, A0) without contract, and much better than the 3 in (A1, A1).
- There is no cost to signing.
- A rational opponent will also sign, knowing they get 7.
- Thus, signing leads to a superior outcome.

First incorporate the contract into the payoffs.

**Contract effects (2 players):**
- If I choose **A0**: I get **+2** (taken from the other player).
- If I choose **A1**: I pay **-2** (given to the other player).
- If the other player chooses **A0**: I lose **-2** (since I fund their +2).
- If the other player chooses **A1**: I gain **+2** (since they pay me).

So my **net transfer** is:
- From my action: **A0 → +2**, **A1 → -2**
- From their action: **they A0 → -2**, **they A1 → +2**

Now compute my **effective payoff** (base payoff + transfers):

1) **(A0, A0)**: base 5 + (my +2) + (their A0 gives me -2) = **5**  
2) **(A0, A1)**: base 0 + (my +2) + (their A1 gives me +2) = **4**  
3) **(A1, A0)**: base 3 + (my -2) + (their A0 gives me -2) = **-1**  
4) **(A1, A1)**: base 3 + (my -2) + (their A1 gives me +2) = **3**

So my payoff table becomes:

- If they play **A0**: A0 gives **5**, A1 gives **-1** → prefer **A0**
- If they play **A1**: A0 gives **4**, A1 gives **3** → prefer **A0**

**A0 strictly dominates A1**, so I should put all probability on **A0**.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal strategy for **Player 2** in this game, given both the base payoff structure and the **contract** that modifies the payoffs.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base payoff matrix (without contract)

We are told that **you are Player 2**.

Let’s define the base payoffs (before contract) from Player 2's perspective:

| Your Action | Opponent (Player 1) Action | Your Payoff (Base) | Opponent Payoff (Base) |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                         | 5                  | 5                      |
| A0          | A1                         | 0                  | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                         | 3                  | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                         | 3                  | 3                      |

So for Player 2 (you), the base payoffs are:

- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → 5
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → 0
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → 3
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → 3

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract is in place and was proposed by Player 1, approved via voting.

**Contract terms:**

- If **you choose A0**, you get **+2 points**, which are **drawn equally from the other players**.
- If **you choose A1**, you **pay -2 points**, which are **distributed equally among the other players**.

Note: The contract is **symmetric in effect** — it applies to every player equally.

Let’s analyze its impact **from your (Player 2)** perspective.

Let $ p $ be the probability that Player 2 (you) chooses A0 (so $ 1-p $ is the probability of choosing A1).

Let $ q $ be the probability that Player 1 chooses A0 (so $ 1-q $ is for A1).

But now, since the contract applies **based on your choice**, we must adjust the **total payoff** you receive, depending on whether you play A0 or A1.

#### How does the contract affect your final payoff?

- If you choose A0: you get **+2** from the contract (in addition to base payoff).
- If you choose A1: you get **-2** from the contract (you pay 2, which goes to others).

So your total payoff is:

> **Total Payoff = Base Payoff + (contract adjustment based on your action)**

So:

- If you play A0: add +2 to your base payoff
- If you play A1: subtract 2 from your base payoff

This means:

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment | Final Payoff |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| A0          | A0               | 5           | +2                  | 7            |
| A0          | A1               | 0           | +2                  | 2            |
| A1          | A0               | 3           | -2                  | 1            |
| A1          | A1               | 3           | -2                  | 1            |

Note: The contract **only changes your payoff**, not the opponent’s. But since the contract says "drawn from other players", and you are the one who receives or pays it, it only affects **you** directly.

So the **effective payoff matrix for Player 2 (you)** is:

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Your Final Payoff |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0               | 7                 |
| A0          | A1               | 2                 |
| A1          | A0               | 1                 |
| A1          | A1               | 1                 |

---

### Step 3: Player 1’s incentives under the contract?

We must be careful: **Player 1 also faces the same contract**, meaning:

- If Player 1 plays A0 → gets +2 from contract
- If Player 1 plays A1 → pays -2

So their own payoffs are **also modified**.

But here’s the key: the contract **affects both players symmetrically**, so both are rewarded for choosing A0 and penalized for A1.

Let’s now find the **effective payoffs for Player 1** (in their own matrix):

| Their Action | Your Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment | Final Payoff |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| A0           | A0          | 5           | +2                  | 7            |
| A0           | A1          | 3           | +2                  | 5            |
| A1           | A0          | 0           | -2                  | -2           |
| A1           | A1          | 3           | -2                  | 1            |

So Player 1’s payoff matrix:

| Your Action | Player 1 Action | Their Payoff |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| A0          | A0               | 7            |
| A1          | A0               | 5            |
| A0          | A1               | -2           |
| A1          | A1               | 1            |

Note: This means **Player 1 is strongly incentivized to choose A0**, because:
- A0 gives them at least 5 (if you play A1) or 7 (if you play A0),
- While A1 only gives them 1 (if you do A1) or -2 (if you do A0) → bad.

So **Player 1 will want to play A0** to avoid losing 2 points.

But **you** are trying to maximize your own payoff. So you should anticipate **Player 1’s rational behavior**.

---

### Step 4: What will Player 1 do?

From their perspective, they will choose the action that maximizes their expected payoff **given your chosen strategy**.

But because the contract rewards A0 and penalizes A1, **A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 1**?

Let’s check:

- Suppose **you** play A0 with probability $ p $
- Then Player 1’s expected payoff:
  - If they play A0: $ p \cdot 7 + (1-p) \cdot 5 = 7p + 5(1-p) = 5 + 2p $
  - If they play A1: $ p \cdot (-2) + (1-p) \cdot 1 = -2p + 1 - p = 1 - 3p $

Compare:
- A0 vs A1: $ 5 + 2p $ vs $ 1 - 3p $

When is $ 5 + 2p > 1 - 3p $?
→ $ 5 + 2p > 1 - 3p $
→ $ 5p > -4 $
→ $ p > -0.8 $ → always true.

So for **all** $ p \in [0,1] $, A0 gives **strictly higher expected payoff** than A1 for Player 1.

**Therefore, Player 1 will always play A0.**

This is **a dominant strategy** for Player 1 **due to the contract**.

Even if Player 2 plays A1 with high probability, Player 1 still prefers A0 (since 5 > -2).

So: **Player 1 will play A0 with probability 100%.**

---

### Step 5: Your optimal response to Player 1 playing A0

Now that we know **Player 1 will always play A0**, your expected payoff given your own strategy is simple.

Let $ p $ = probability you (Player 2) play A0.

Then:
- With probability $ p $: you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get $ 7 $
- With probability $ 1-p $: you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get $ 1 $

So your expected payoff:

> $ E = p \cdot 7 + (1 - p) \cdot 1 = 7p + 1 - p = 6p + 1 $

This is **strictly increasing** in $ p $.

So to **maximize your expected payoff**, you should set $ p = 1 $ → always play A0.

Then your expected payoff is $ 6(1) + 1 = 7 $.

Any lower $ p $ gives you less.

---

### Step 6: Verify consistency

- You play A0 with probability 100% → you get 7 when opponent plays A0 (which they do).
- Opponent (Player 1) sees:
  - If they play A0: get 7 (vs you A0) → payoff 7
  - If they play A1: get -2 (vs you A0) → payoff -2 → worse
  - So they stick with A0.
- So equilibrium: both play A0 → your payoff is 7.

Is there any incentive to deviate?

- If you play A1 instead: payoff = 1 → worse than 7.
- So no.

Hence, **your best strategy is to always play A0**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer

You should play A0 with 100% probability, A1 with 0%.

response:
Let's break down the decision-making process step by step and analyze each contract proposal.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Payoff Without Any Contract:
- If both choose A0:
  - You: 5 points
  - Other player: 5 points
- If you choose A0 and other chooses A1:
  - You: 0 points
  - Other player: 3 points
- If you choose A1 and other chooses A0:
  - You: 3 points
  - Other player: 0 points
- If both choose A1:
  - You: 3 points
  - Other player: 3 points

#### Contract Proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they get 1 extra point from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they lose 1 point to the other player.

##### New Payoff Table with Contract by Player 1:
- Both choose A0:
  - You: 5 + 1 = 6 points
  - Other player: 5 + 1 = 6 points
- You choose A0, other chooses A1:
  - You: 0 + 1 = 1 point
  - Other player: 3 - 1 = 2 points
- You choose A1, other chooses A0:
  - You: 3 - 1 = 2 points
  - Other player: 0 + 1 = 1 point
- Both choose A1:
  - You: 3 - 1 = 2 points
  - Other player: 3 - 1 = 2 points

#### Contract Proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they get 4 extra points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional points are exchanged.

##### New Payoff Table with Contract by Player 2:
- Both choose A0:
  - You: 5 + 4 = 9 points
  - Other player: 5 - 4 = 1 point
- You choose A0, other chooses A1:
  - You: 0 + 4 = 4 points
  - Other player: 3 - 4 = -1 point
- You choose A1, other chooses A0:
  - You: 3 - 4 = -1 point
  - Other player: 0 + 4 = 4 points
- Both choose A1:
  - You: 3 points
  - Other player: 3 points

### Comparison and Approval Decision

#### Without the contracts:
- The equilibrium without cooperation might be both choosing A1, leading to 3 points each.

#### With Contract by Player 1:
- Both choosing A0 gives 6 points each — better than any non-cooperative outcome (2 points when both choose A1).

#### With Contract by Player 2:
- Both choosing A0 gives 9 points vs 1 point — highly unbalanced.
- You choosing A0 and other choosing A1 results in 4 points for you and -1 for the other, very detrimental for other player, could lead to high conflict.

### Conclusion
Contract by Player 1 seems fairer and more balance-providing for both parties, thus leading to more stable cooperation and mutual benefit.

response:
To determine whether to approve each of the proposed contracts, we'll need to evaluate the total points we can expect to receive under each contract compared to playing the game without any contract. Here's how to systematically analyze each contract:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Payoff Matrix (No Contract)**:
   - If both choose A0: Both players get 5 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
   - If both choose A1: Both players get 3 points.

2. **Introducing Contract by Player 1**:
   - A0 -> +1 point, A1 -> -1 point (from each player)
   
   Payoff Matrix under Contract by Player 1:
   - If both choose A0: Payoff = 5 + 1 (each) = 6 points for both.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Payoff = 3 - 1 = 2 points for Player 1, 0 + 1 = 1 point for Player 2.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Payoff = 0 + 1 = 1 point for Player 1, 3 - 1 = 2 points for Player 2.
   - If both choose A1: Payoff = 3 - 1 (each) = 2 points for both.

3. **Introducing Contract by Player 2**:
   - A0 -> +2 points, A1 -> -2 points (from each player)
   
   Payoff Matrix under Contract by Player 2:
   - If both choose A0: Payoff = 5 + 2 (each) = 7 points for both.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Payoff = 3 - 2 = 1 point for Player 1, 0 + 2 = 2 points for Player 2.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Payoff = 0 + 2 = 2 points for Player 1, 3 - 2 = 1 point for Player 2.
   - If both choose A1: Payoff = 3 - 2 (each) = 1 point for both.

### Comparison and Decision:

1. **No Contract**: Highest total points are achieved (5 points for both players) if both choose A0, stable at 5 points.
2. **Contract by Player 1**: Highest total points are 6 points if both choose A0, but if one player deviates to A1, the point distribution becomes unbalanced.
3. **Contract by Player 2**: Highest total points are 7 points if both choose A0, which is superior to all other configurations.

From a strategic point of view as Player 2, the contract proposed by Player 2 offers the highest potential payoff for mutual cooperation (both choosing A0). Here, the potential downside is accepting to pay 2 points if choosing A1, a significant penalty that makes harmonious cooperation more attractive.

**Final Decision**: Approve the contract that provides the highest reward for cooperation and overall fairness. Given the additional rewards for cooperation, we should approve only the contract proposed by Player 2.

response:
Let's break down the decision-making process for approving or rejecting the contracts based on the given setup and potential outcomes.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Basic Payoff Structure**:
    - Both players choosing A0 yields 5 points each.
    - You choosing A0 and the other player choosing A1 yields 0 points for you, 3 points for the other player.
    - You choosing A1 and the other player choosing A0 yields 3 points for you, 0 points for the other player.
    - Both players choosing A1 yields 3 points each.

2. **Contract Proposed by Player 1 (C1)**:
    - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other player.
    - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other players.
    
    - If both choose A0: Payoff = 5 + 1 - 0 = 6 points each.
    - If you choose A0, other chooses A1: Payoff = 0 + 1 - 1 = 0 points for you; 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 points for the other player.
    - If you choose A1, other chooses A0: Payoff = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 points for you; 0 + 1 - 1 = 0 points for the other player.
    - If both choose A1: Payoff = 3 - 1 - 1 + 1 = 3 points each.

3. **Contract Proposed by Player 2 (C2)**:
    - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
    - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.
    
    - If both choose A0: Payoff = 5 + 2 - 2 = 7 points each.
    - If you choose A0, other chooses A1: Payoff = 0 + 2 - 2 = 0 points for you; 3 - 2 + 2 = 3 points for the other player.
    - If you choose A1, other chooses A0: Payoff = 3 - 2 + 2 = 3 points for you; 0 + 2 - 2 = 0 points for the other player.
    - If both choose A1: Payoff = 3 - 2 - 2 + 2 = 1 point each.

### Comparison and Decision:

- **Contract 1 (C1)**: 
    - If both choose A0, each player gets 6 points.
    - If both choose A1, they get 3 points each.
    - A balanced outcome where players are mildly incentivized to choose A0, leading to mutual cooperation with higher collective points (6).

- **Contract 2 (C2)**: 
    - If both choose A0, each player gets 7 points.
    - If both choose A1, they fare worse with only 1 point each.
    - The incentives are stronger for choosing A0 and create a significant penalty for choosing A1, strongly encouraging mutual cooperation with an even higher payoff (7).

Given the objective to maximize points and the mutual best outcome when both players agree to cooperate, both contracts favor cooperation (A0). However, C2 offers a higher payoff when both cooperate (7 points), making it strictly better than C1 in that scenario.

### Final Decision:
- Approve both contracts since both encourage cooperation and increase total points.

response:
To determine which contracts to approve, it's essential to evaluate how each will affect the total points I can expect to receive. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Initial Payoff Matrix
The default game has the following payoff matrix for Player 1 (me) and Player 2:

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

### Step 2: Evaluate Contract 1
**Contract proposed by Player 1:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other players.

Adjusting the payoff matrix to include Contract 1:

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (6, 4)       | (1, 2)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (2, 1)       | (2, 2)       |

### Step 3: Evaluate Contract 2
**Contract proposed by Player 2:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Adjusting the payoff matrix to include Contract 2:

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (7, 3)       | (2, 1)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (1, 2)       | (1, 1)       |

### Step 4: Analyze the Effects

#### Contract 1 Analysis:
- Choosing A0 against A0 yields me 6 points, otherwise 1 against A1.
- Choosing A1 yields me 2 points regardless of the other player’s choice.

#### Contract 2 Analysis:
- Choosing A0 against A0 yields me 7 points, otherwise 2 against A1.
- Choosing A1 yields me 1 point regardless of the other player’s choice.

### Step 5: Approve Strategy
I need to maximize my expected payoff. In both contracts, choosing A0 when the other player also picks A0 is highly beneficial.
- Under Contract 1, A0 seems better than A1 in all outcomes except when Player 2 chooses A1 resulting in fewer points.
- Under Contract 2, A0 is significantly better than A1 when both choose A0; however, I get minimally better payoffs if the other player picks A0 while I pick A1.

Overall, both contracts help in steering behavior towards mutual cooperation (A0, A0), maintaining high payoffs. Both contracts incentivize cooperation but disincentivize deviation, holding both players accountable.

### Step 6: Final Approval Decision
Both contracts could potentially be beneficial. Approving both maximizes the chances of having at least one beneficial contract selected. 

Here's the JSON object with my approvals:

```json
{
    "C1": true,
    "C2": true
}
```

I approve both proposed contracts. They both encourage cooperative gameplay, which maximizes collective and individual payoffs.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
Let's evaluate the given contracts by analyzing how they impact the payoffs and the incentives for both players. Our goal is to maximize our expected points.

### Initial Payoff Matrix
First, let's recall the initial payoffs without any contract:

|           | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Player 1 A0** | (5, 5)     | (0, 3)     |
| **Player 1 A1** | (3, 0)     | (3, 3)     |

### Evaluating Contract C1
Contract C1 proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

We'll update the payoff matrix considering C1:

- **Player 1 A0** & **Player 2 A0**: (6, 4)
- **Player 1 A0** & **Player 2 A1**: (1, 2)
- **Player 1 A1** & **Player 2 A0**: (2, 1)
- **Player 1 A1** & **Player 2 A1**: (2, 2)

Updated Matrix under C1:

|           | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Player 1 A0** | (6, 4)     | (1, 2)     |
| **Player 1 A1** | (2, 1)     | (2, 2)     |

### Evaluating Contract C2
Contract C2 proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

We'll update the payoff matrix considering C2:

- **Player 1 A0** & **Player 2 A0**: (9, 1)
- **Player 1 A0** & **Player 2 A1**: (4, -1)
- **Player 1 A1** & **Player 2 A0**: (-1, 4)
- **Player 1 A1** & **Player 2 A1**: (3, 3)

Updated Matrix under C2:

|           | Player 2 A0| Player 2 A1 |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Player 1 A0** | (9, 1)    | (4, -1)    |
| **Player 1 A1** | (-1, 4)   | (3, 3)     |

### Analysis for Approval
- **Without any contract**, (A0, A0) yields the highest total points (10 points total, with Player 1 getting 5).
- **Under Contract C1**, the total points with (A0, A0) is 10, but we get an additional point making it the best option for us, thus increasing the incentive to go for (A0, A0). This strategy seems to work in our favor.
- **Under Contract C2**, choosing A0 gives us high points when Player 2 chooses A0, but it significantly disadvantages Player 2 while risking a significant loss if Player 2 chooses A1. This contract creates a high variance in outcomes and could lead to player 2 always favoring A1 to minimize loss, which isn’t ideal for us.

Therefore, Contract C1 aligns better with our goal of maximizing points while maintaining a balanced, incentivized strategy. Contract C2, while lucrative under certain conditions, carries higher risk and isn't as beneficial.

### Final Approval Decision

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": false
}
```

This approval ensures we endorse the contract that maximizes our expected payoffs while maintaining a stable and aligned strategy for both players.

response:
To determine whether to approve each contract, we need to consider the potential impacts of these contracts on the overall payouts to maximize our total points. Let's analyze both proposed contracts step-by-step.

### Analysis of the Game without Contracts:
First, let's understand the base game without any contracts in place:

- If both players choose A0:
  - Player 1: 5 points
  - Player 2: 5 points

- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 0 points
  - Player 2: 3 points

- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 3 points
  - Player 2: 0 points
  
- If both players choose A1:
  - Player 1: 3 points
  - Player 2: 3 points

### Contract Proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point drawn equally from the other player.
  - If both choose A0:
    - Player 1: 5 points + 1 point - 0.5 points = 5.5 points
    - Player 2: 5 points + 1 point - 0.5 points = 5.5 points
  - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
    - Player 1: 0 points + 1 point = 1 point
    - Player 2: 3 points - 1 point = 2 points
  - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
    - Player 1: 3 points - 1 point = 2 points
    - Player 2: 0 points + 1 point = 1 point
  - If both choose A1:
    - Player 1: 3 points - 0.5 points = 2.5 points
    - Player 2: 3 points - 0.5 points = 2.5 points

### Contract Proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there are no additional payments.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 4 points:
  - If both choose A0:
    - Player 1: 5 points
    - Player 2: 5 points
  - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
    - Player 1: 0 points + 2 points = 2 points
    - Player 2: 3 points - 4 points = -1 points
  - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
    - Player 1: 3 points - 4 points = -1 points
    - Player 2: 0 points + 2 points = 2 points
  - If both choose A1:
    - Player 1: 3 points - 4 points + 2 points = 1 point
    - Player 2: 3 points - 4 points + 2 points = 1 point

### Comparison of Contracts
**Contract 1 (Player 1's Proposal) Evaluation:**
- Mutual A0: Increases total points for both, still encourages cooperation.
- Mixed (A0 or A1): Slightly penalizes the chooser of A1, helps reduce defection.
- Mutual A1: Decreases incentive for mutual defection, still not ideal but better than base points.

**Contract 2 (Player 2's Proposal) Evaluation:**
- Mutual A0: No impact, same as base game points.
- Mixed: Severely penalizes the chooser of A1, heavily discourages defection.
- Mutual A1: Severely penalizes both, extreme disincentive for mutual defection.

Given that the aim is to maximize total points in a collaborative or self-interested rational approach, Contract 1 is marginally aligned towards cooperation while reducing defection risks moderately. Contract 2 excessively penalizes defection but gets extremely punitive when mutual defection occurs.

### Conclusion:
We can see that Contract 1 has a balanced approach that increases total points allocation during cooperation and lessens points loss during mixed or mutual defection states, compared to the severe penalties in Contract 2. Therefore, the strategy should approve Contract 1 and reject Contract 2.

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": false
}
```

This decision enhances the likelihood of high points in cooperative scenarios while maintaining defensible outcomes in defection scenarios.

response:
To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the proposed contracts and determine which ones align with our objective of maximizing our total points.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Evaluate the Basic Game without Contracts:**
   - If both players choose A0: Both get 5 points each.
   - If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other gets 3 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
   - If both players choose A1: Both get 3 points each.

2. **Analyze the Impacts of Each Contract:**

   **Contract 1 (C1) proposed by Player 1:**
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive 1 additional point from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 additional point to the other player.

   **Payoff with Contract 1:**
   - If both choose A0: Each player initially gets 5 points. With the contract, each gets 6 points (5 + 1 from the other player).
   - If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 0 points initially. With the contract, you get 1 point (0 + 1 from the other). The other player gets 3 points and pays you 1 point, resulting in 2 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 3 points initially. With the contract, you end up with 2 points (3 - 1 to the other player). The other player gets 1 point (0 + 1).
   - If both choose A1: Each player initially gets 3 points. With the contract, each pays 1 point, leaving them with 2 points (3 - 1).

   **Contract 2 (C2) proposed by Player 2:**
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive 1 additional point from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 additional points to the other player.

   **Payoff with Contract 2:**
   - If both choose A0: Each player initially gets 5 points. With the contract, each gets 6 points (5 + 1 from the other player).
   - If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 0 points initially. With the contract, you get 1 point (0 + 1 from the other). The other player gets 3 points and pays you 2 points, resulting in 1 point.
   - If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 3 points initially. With the contract, you end up with 1 point (3 - 2 to the other player). The other player gets 1 point (0 + 1).
   - If both choose A1: Each player initially gets 3 points. With the contract, each pays 2 points, leaving them with 1 point (3 - 2).

### Decision Making:

- **Contract C1:** 
  - Overall, when both choose A0, both players benefit the most (6 points each).
  - When there's a mix, the penalties and rewards seem balanced, not heavily inclined towards any drastic take.
  - If both choose A1, the result is less beneficial than without a contract but not drastically so.

- **Contract C2:** 
  - When both choose A0, the outcome is the best (6 points each).
  - When there's a mix, the penalties for choosing A1 are very steep (netting only 1 or negative points).
  - If both choose A1, the result is far less beneficial (1 point each).

Therefore, **Contract C2** penalizes choosing A1 very sharply, which could deter rational players from choosing A1 and thus promotes the maximum mutual gain strategy (both choosing A0).

### Conclusion:

Given that both contracts maximize mutual gain when both players pick A0, but **Contract C1** has less severe penalties for deviating strategies, I'd approve **Contract C1** to ensure more balanced flexibility.

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": false
}
```

This ensures the best blend of strategies while maximizing potential total points.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's examine how the payments and payoffs would change under the contract and if it would be beneficial for me (Player 2) to sign it or not.

### Understanding the Game Without the Contract
Let's first summarize the payoffs without considering the additional payments from the contract.
- If both players choose A0: Player 2 gets 5 points, Player 1 gets 5 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If both players choose A1: Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.

### Adding the Contract Payoffs
With the contract, the payoffs would adjust as:
- If both players choose A0: Player 2 gets 5 + 2 - 1 (subtracting 1 point for Player 1's additional payment) = 6 points, Player 1 gets 5 + 2 - 1 = 6 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 + 2 - 1 = 1 point, Player 1 gets 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 points, Player 1 gets 0 + 2 - 1 = 1 point.
- If both players choose A1: Player 2 gets 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 points, Player 1 gets 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 points.

### Analyzing the Effect
- **Without Contract:**
  - Best case for Player 2: 5 points (both choose A0).
  - Worst case for Player 2: 0 points (Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1).

- **With Contract:**
  - Best case for Player 2: 6 points (both choose A0).
  - Worst case for Player 2: 1 point (Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1).

The contract looks beneficial:
- It increases the payoff for mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) from 5 to 6 points.
- It mitigates the loss to some degree if Player 1 does not cooperate, as the worst payoff increases from 0 to 1 point.

Therefore, signing the contract looks advantageous because it improves the overall expected points for mutual cooperation and reduces the risk in the worst-case scenario.

### Conclusion
Given the improvements to both the best-case and worst-case scenarios for Player 2 with the contract in place, it is beneficial to sign it.

  "sign": true

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the payoffs with and without the contract.

### Payoff Matrix Without the Contract

The payoffs for each combination of actions are as follows (you are Player 1):

- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

We can summarize this in a matrix:

|         | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Player 1: A0 | (5, 5)       |  (0, 3)     |
| Player 1: A1 | (3, 0)       |  (3, 3)     |

### Payoff Matrix With the Contract

With the contract, choosing A0 gives an additional 2 points, whereas choosing A1 loses 2 points. This alters the payoffs because the contract specifies payments drawn equally from the other player.

Let's adjust the original matrix to include these payments:

- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0, you both get 5 + 2 (since both gain 2 points) = 7 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you get 0 + 2 = 2 points, the other player gets 3 - 2 = 1 point.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, you get 3 - 2 = 1 points, the other player gets 0 + 2 = 2 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1, you both get 3 - 2 = 1 point.

We can now summarize this adjusted payoff matrix:

|         | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Player 1: A0 | (7, 7)       |  (2, 1)     |
| Player 1: A1 | (1, 2)       |  (1, 1)     |

### Analysis

With the contract:
- The best outcome for both choosing A0 is 7 points each, representing a cooperative strategy.
- If miscoordination occurs, the penalties are spread more clearly: 2 vs 1, and 1 vs 2.
- Mutual non-cooperation (both choosing A1) gives a relatively low payoff (1 each).

Without the contract:
- The mutual cooperation outcome (A0, A0) is still good (5 each), but slightly worse than the cooperative scenario with the contract.
- Miscoordination is harsher: 0 and 3 points.
- Non-cooperation (A1, A1) is neutral but less than optimal compared to cooperative payoffs.

### Decision

The contract incentivizes both players to choose A0, leading to a mutual highest payoff of 7 points versus 5 points without the contract. Signing the contract maximizes the potential cooperative gain and mitigates risk due to miscoordination.

Thus, it is beneficial to sign the contract.

response:
Let's analyze the game and the payment contract step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix
Without considering the contract, the payoff matrix is:

|         | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| P2: A0  | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| P2: A1  | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

Where (X, Y) indicates (Player 2's payoff, Player 1's payoff) in points.

### Step 2: Understanding the Contract's Impact
The contract modifies the payoffs by adding or subtracting 2 points based on the actions:

- If either player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points.
- If either player chooses A1, they must pay 2 points.

This results in an updated payoff matrix:

|         | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| P2: A0  | (7, 3)       | (2, 1)       |
| P2: A1  | (1, 2)       | (1, 1)       |

### Step 3: Dominant Strategy Analysis
Looking at the updated payoff matrix, let's identify the best possible strategies:

- When Player 1 chooses A0:
  - If P2 chooses A0, P2 gets 7 points.
  - If P2 chooses A1, P2 gets 1 point.
  Thus, A0 is preferable for Player 2 (7 > 1).

- When Player 1 chooses A1:
  - If P2 chooses A0, P2 gets 2 points.
  - If P2 chooses A1, P2 gets 1 point.
  Thus, A0 is preferable for Player 2 (2 > 1).

In both scenarios, Player 2 should choose A0 to maximize points, regardless of what Player 1 does.

### Step 4: Probability Distribution
Given that A0 is the dominant strategy for Player 2 to maximize their payoff, the probability distribution should heavily favor A0.

### Conclusion
The optimal strategy is to put all the probability on A0 to ensure the maximum points each round, which translates to choosing A0 with 100% probability.

Finally, we'll convert this strategy into the required JSON format:

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

This distribution ensures that Player 2 maximizes their points with the given contract's constraints.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for this game, we need to analyze the payoffs and the impact of the payment contract on each decision. Let's break down the decision-making process step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Basic Payoff Structure
Without considering the contract, the payoffs are as follows:
1. If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:
   - You get 5 points.
   - The other player gets 5 points.
2. If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
   - You get 0 points.
   - The other player gets 3 points.
3. If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
   - You get 3 points.
   - The other player gets 0 points.
4. If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:
   - You both get 3 points each.

### Step 2: Integrate the Payment Contract
The payment contract modifies the payoffs as follows:
- Choosing A0 gives you an additional 2 points, taken from the other player.
- Choosing A1 costs you 2 points, given to the other player.

Revised payoffs:
1. If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:
   - You get 5 points + 2 points = **7 points**.
   - The other player gets 5 points - 2 points = **3 points**.
2. If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
   - You get 0 points + 2 points = **2 points**.
   - The other player gets 3 points - 2 points = **1 point**.
3. If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
   - You get 3 points - 2 points = **1 point**.
   - The other player gets 0 points + 2 points = **2 points**.
4. If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:
   - You get 3 points - 2 points = **1 point**.
   - The other player gets 3 points + 2 points = **5 points**.

### Step 3: Calculate Expected Payoff for Each Action Probability

To decide the optimal strategy, consider the potential choices and the randomness of choice probabilities.

Let \( P(A0) \) and \( P(A1) \) denote your probabilities for choosing A0 and A1, respectively. Similarly for Player 2, let \( Q(A0) \) and \( Q(A1) \) be the probabilities.

The expected payoffs for choosing A0 and A1 (from your perspective):

**Expected Payoff (A0):**
\[ 
E(A0) = Q(A0) \cdot 7 + Q(A1) \cdot 2 
\]
**Expected Payoff (A1):**
\[ 
E(A1) = Q(A0) \cdot 1 + Q(A1) \cdot 1 
\]

### Step 4: Analyze and Decide on Probabilities
To maximize the payoff, your goal is to select the action with the highest expected value. Since the equation for \( E(A1) \) remains constant (1 point), focus on maximizing \( E(A0) \).

Simplifying, with general \( Q(A0) \) and \( Q(A1) \):
\[ 
E(A0) = 7 \cdot Q(A0) + 2 \cdot Q(A1) 
\]
Since \( Q(A0) + Q(A1) = 1 \):
\[ 
E(A0) = 7 \cdot Q(A0) + 2 \cdot (1 - Q(A0)) 
= 7 \cdot Q(A0) + 2 - 2 \cdot Q(A0) 
= 5 \cdot Q(A0) + 2 
\]

### Step 5: Derive Optimal Strategy
Given that \( E(A0) \) is driven by \( Q(A0) \), noticing that increasing \( Q(A0) \) upweights more beneficial points.

To simplify, compile a strategy:
- You will predominantly favor \( A0 \) to maximize the higher output points.

### Final Answer

Given all the above analysis, optimal probability making \( A0 \) largely leads toward higher point accrual. Henceforth, output will bias mainly to \( A0 \).

```json
{
  "A0": 80,
  "A1": 20
}
```

This distribution means you have an 80% chance of choosing A0 and a 20% chance of choosing A1 to maximize your points considering the contract.

response:
To determine which contracts to approve, we need to carefully evaluate how each contract impacts our total points and the strategies that result. We will review each contract separately, compare the outcomes, and justify whether to approve or disapprove it.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### Default Payoff Matrix Analysis (Without Contracts)
First, let’s understand the payoffs without any contracts:
- (A0, A0) -> (5, 5)
- (A0, A1) -> (0, 3)
- (A1, A0) -> (3, 0)
- (A1, A1) -> (3, 3)

#### Contract 1 Analysis
**Contract proposed by Player 1:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other player.
  - (A0, A0): Both players get an additional 4 points (total: 9 points each).
  - (A0, A1): P2 gets 0 + 4 = 4 points, P1 gets 3 - 4 = -1 points.
  - (A1, A0): P2 gets 3 - 4 = -1 points, P1 gets 0 + 4 = 4 points.
  - (A1, A1): No change (total: 3 points each).

#### Contract 2 Analysis
**Contract proposed by Player 2:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player, and if a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points distributed equally among the other players.
  - (A0, A0): Both players get an additional 2 points (total: 7 points each).
  - (A0, A1): P2 gets 0 + 2 = 2 points, P1 gets 3 - 2 = 1 point.
  - (A1, A0): P2 gets 3 - 2 = 1 point, P1 gets 0 + 2 = 2 points.
  - (A1, A1): Both players get an additional penalty of -2 points (total: 1 point each).

### Strategy to Maximize Points
To maximize my total points, I will consider the new payoff matrices due to each contract design and determine which one increases my expected payoff and align both players' strategies towards mutual benefits.

#### Contract 1 (Player 1):
Payoff Matrix:
- (A0, A0) -> (9, 9)
- (A0, A1) -> (4, -1)
- (A1, A0) -> (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1) -> (3, 3)

#### Contract 2 (Player 2):
Payoff Matrix:
- (A0, A0) -> (7, 7)
- (A0, A1) -> (2, 1)
- (A1, A0) -> (1, 2)
- (A1, A1) -> (1, 1)

### Analysis and Conclusion
To maximize my points, I would prefer the matrix where mutual cooperation (choosing A0) is most beneficial and any deviation is punished less severely.

- **Player 1's Contract:** incentivizes A0 with significant benefits and punishes deviations strongly.
- **Player 2's Contract:** also favors A0 but with lesser benefits and softer penalties.

Given these evaluations, both contracts provide incentives for mutual A0, though Player 1's contract offers higher payoffs and more punitive measures for deviation, ensuring stronger adherence to A0.

### Final Approvals
Both contracts are acceptable since both improve the expected outcomes, but Player 1’s contract offers higher payoffs in cooperative scenarios.

response:
Under the original payoffs, there are two coordination equilibria: (A0,A0) giving 5 each, and (A1,A1) giving 3 each. So without a contract, there’s a meaningful risk the play ends up on (A1,A1).

**Contract C1 effect (A0 gets +4 from the other player):**
- If the other plays **A0**: my payoff is **A0 → 5**, **A1 → -1** ⇒ I prefer **A0**.
- If the other plays **A1**: my payoff is **A0 → 4**, **A1 → 3** ⇒ I still prefer **A0**.
So **A0 strictly dominates** under C1, making (A0,A0) the unique outcome, giving me **5**.

**Contract C2 effect (A0 gets +2 from other; A1 pays 2 to other):**
Computing outcomes shows it yields the **same effective payoff matrix** as C1 (notably: A0 vs A1 gives the A0-player 4 and the A1-player -1), so again **A0 strictly dominates** and (A0,A0) results with payoff **5** for me.

Both contracts improve (or at least secure) my outcome relative to the no-contract risk, so I approve **both** to maximize the chance that some contract is adopted.

On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:

- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Considering the payoff matrix of the base game for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2):

| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

In the base game, there are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) with a payoff of (5, 5) and (A1, A1) with a payoff of (3, 3). While (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant, (A1, A1) is often safer because choosing A1 guarantees a player at least 3 points regardless of the other player's move, whereas choosing A0 carries the risk of getting 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

The proposed contracts (C1 and C2 are identical) introduce a transfer of 4 points: any player choosing A0 receives 4 points from the other player. Let's recalculate the payoff matrix with this contract in place:

- **(A0, A0):** P1 gets $5 + 4 - 4 = 5$; P2 gets $5 + 4 - 4 = 5$.
- **(A0, A1):** P1 gets $0 + 4 - 0 = 4$; P2 gets $3 + 0 - 4 = -1$.
- **(A1, A0):** P1 gets $3 + 0 - 4 = -1$; P2 gets $0 + 4 - 0 = 4$.
- **(A1, A1):** P1 gets $3 + 0 - 0 = 3$; P2 gets $3 + 0 - 0 = 3$.

Revised Payoff Matrix:

| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **P1: A1** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

In this revised matrix, A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players. If P2 chooses A0, P1 prefers A0 (5 > -1). If P2 chooses A1, P1 still prefers A0 (4 > 3). The logic is identical for P2. Therefore, with the contract, both players are incentivized to choose A0, leading to the (A0, A0) outcome and a payoff of 5 points each. This is superior to the original coordination game where players might have defaulted to the "safe" A1 strategy and only received 3 points each.

Since the contracts (C1 and C2) stabilize the highest payout of 5 points as a dominant strategy equilibrium, they are beneficial for both players.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

The original payoff matrix (my payoff, other's payoff):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)  
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

## Step 2: Find the Nash equilibrium without contracts

Without a contract:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (5) over A1 (3)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A1 (3) over A0 (0)

No pure strategy dominates. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium has each player playing A0 with probability 3/5.

Expected payoff without contract: **3 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract C1 and C2

Both contracts are identical! They add:
- +4 points to whoever plays A0 (paid by the other player)
- No payment for A1

New effective payoffs with either contract:
- (A0, A0): (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0+4, 3-4) = (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (3-4, 0+4) = (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

## Step 4: Find Nash equilibrium with contracts

With either contract:
- If other plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1 → **A0 better**
- If other plays A1: I get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **A0 better**

A0 now **strictly dominates** A1 for me (and by symmetry, for the other player too).

Nash equilibrium with contract: Both play A0 with probability 1.

Expected payoff with contract: **5 points**

## Step 5: Decision

Since 5 > 3, both contracts improve my expected payoff from 3 to 5 points. Both contracts are identical and beneficial.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### 1. Understanding the Base Game

Let me first analyze the original game payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):

|        | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0 | 5, 5 | 0, 3 |
| I play A1 | 3, 0 | 3, 3 |

This is a **coordination game** with:
- Two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving (5,5) and (A1, A1) giving (3,3)
- A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both players play A0 with probability 3/5, yielding expected payoff of 3
- Risk of miscoordination or getting stuck at the inferior equilibrium

### 2. Analyzing the Proposed Contracts

Both C1 and C2 are **identical**:
- If a player chooses A0: they receive +4 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1: no additional payments

### 3. Modified Payoff Matrix with Contract

With either contract in place:

|        | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0 | 5+4-4 = **5** | 0+4 = **4** |
| I play A1 | 3-4 = **-1** | **3** |

Breakdown:
- (A0, A0): Both get +4 for playing A0, both pay -4 to the other → Net: (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): I get +4 for A0, opponent pays me -4, no other transfers → (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): Opponent gets +4, I pay -4 → (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): No transfers → (3, 3)

### 4. Finding the New Nash Equilibrium

With the contract:
- **If opponent plays A0**: I get 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- **If opponent plays A1**: I get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players!**

The unique Nash equilibrium is **(A0, A0)** with payoffs **(5, 5)**.

### 5. Comparison and Decision

**Without contract:**
- Risk of miscoordination
- Might get stuck at mixed strategy equilibrium (expected payoff = 3)
- Uncertainty between multiple equilibria

**With contract:**
- Guarantees the best outcome (5, 5)
- Eliminates coordination risk
- A0 is dominant, so rational play is clear

**Conclusion:** The contract is highly beneficial as it ensures I receive the maximum possible payoff of 5 points with certainty.

Since both C1 and C2 are identical and both beneficial, I approve both.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

Base game payoffs (My payoff, Opponent's payoff):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3) 
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This game has two Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) giving 5 points each - the efficient outcome
- (A1, A1) giving 3 points each - the inefficient outcome

Without a contract, there's coordination risk - we might end up at the worse equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1: +4 payment for playing A0, 0 for A1

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 4 - 4 = 5 (I receive 4 for my A0, pay 4 for opponent's A0)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 4 = 4 (I receive 4 for my A0, opponent plays A1)
- (A1, A0): 3 - 4 = -1 (I pay 4 for opponent's A0)
- (A1, A1): 3 (no payments)

My best responses:
- If opponent plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives -1 → Play A0
- If opponent plays A1: A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3 → Play A0

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy!** The same logic applies to my opponent. This guarantees the (A0, A0) outcome with 5 points for me.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2: +2 payment for playing A0, -2 payment for playing A1

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 2 - 2 = 5 (I receive 2, pay 2)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 + 2 = 4 (I receive 2 for A0, receive 2 from opponent's A1 penalty)
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 - 2 = -1 (I pay 2 penalty, pay 2 for opponent's A0 bonus)
- (A1, A1): 3 - 2 + 2 = 3 (I pay 2, receive 2)

My best responses:
- If opponent plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives -1 → Play A0
- If opponent plays A1: A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3 → Play A0

**A0 also becomes my dominant strategy under Contract 2!** Again, this guarantees (A0, A0) with 5 points.

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts achieve the same outcome:
- Transform the game so A0 is dominant for both players
- Eliminate coordination risk
- Guarantee the efficient equilibrium (5, 5)
- Increase my expected payoff from the risky base game to a guaranteed 5 points

Both contracts are beneficial and equivalent in outcome. I should approve both.

To maximize points, we first analyze the original payoff matrix (where Player 1 is the row player and Player 2 is the column player):

| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding (5, 5) and (A1, A1) yielding (3, 3). While (A0, A0) is socially optimal, action A1 is "safer" in the original game because it ensures a payoff of 3 regardless of the other player's move.

Next, we evaluate the proposed contracts:
- **Contract 1 (C1):** A0 receives 1 point from the other player; A1 pays 1 point to the other player.
    - (A0, A0): 5+1-1 = 5 each.
    - (A0, A1): P1 gets 0+2 = 2, P2 gets 3-2 = 1.
    - (A1, A0): P1 gets 3-2 = 1, P2 gets 0+2 = 2.
    - (A1, A1): 3-1+1 = 3 each.
  In C1, (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) remain equilibria. Risk for A0 is reduced (worst case 1 instead of 0), but A1 is still viable.

- **Contract 2 (C2):** A0 receives 4 points from the other player; A1 involves no payments.
    - (A0, A0): 5+4-4 = 5 each.
    - (A0, A1): P1 gets 0+4 = 4, P2 gets 3-4 = -1.
    - (A1, A0): P1 gets 3-4 = -1, P2 gets 0+4 = 4.
    - (A1, A1): 3 each.
  In C2, action A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players. For instance, if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 (5) over A1 (-1). If P1 plays A1, P2 prefers A0 (4) over A1 (3). This makes the (5, 5) outcome much more certain.

Since C2 transforms the game into one where the maximum payoff (5,5) is achieved through dominant strategies, it is the superior choice. C1 also improves upon the original game but is less effective than C2. To maximize the probability that the best contract (C2) is selected under the approval voting rules, Player 2 should only approve C2.

### Step-by-step reasoning (Player 2)

#### 1) Write the original payoff matrix (P1 rows, P2 columns)
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)  
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)  
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)  
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria: **(A0,A0)** and **(A1,A1)**, with (A0,A0) giving the best payoff (5 each).

#### 2) Understand what the contracts do (2 players)
Each contract is a **transfer** between the two players:
- If you play **A0**, you receive +k (the other pays k).
- If you play **A1**, you pay k (the other receives k).
- If both play the same action, transfers cancel out (net 0 each).

So the only changes are in the **off-diagonal** outcomes (miscoordination).

#### 3) Compute Player 2 payoffs under each contract

**Contract C1 (k = 1):**
- If (P1 A1, P2 A0): P2 gets \(0 + 1 = 1\)
- If (P1 A0, P2 A1): P2 gets \(3 - 1 = 2\)
- (A0,A0) stays 5; (A1,A1) stays 3

**Contract C2 (k = 2):**
- If (P1 A1, P2 A0): P2 gets \(0 + 2 = 2\)
- If (P1 A0, P2 A1): P2 gets \(3 - 2 = 1\)
- (A0,A0) stays 5; (A1,A1) stays 3

#### 4) Which contract is better for me?
Both contracts:
- keep the best coordinated outcome (A0,A0) at **5** for me,
- but **C2** rewards choosing **A0** more strongly in the miscoordination case where the other plays A1 (I’d get 2 instead of 1),
- and it penalizes choosing A1 against A0 more strongly (but I can avoid that by favoring A0).

So, from my perspective, **C2 provides stronger incentives toward A0 and better protects me when I play A0 and the other doesn’t**.

#### 5) Approval strategy
Since the winning contract is chosen among those with the most approvals, I should **not** approve a weaker alternative that could be selected instead of the stronger one.

So I approve **C2 only**, and reject **C1**.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract or not, let's break down the problem step by step. First, we will analyze the payoff structure without the contract, and then with the contract.

### Payoff Structure without Contract:
- If both players choose A0:
  - Player 1: 5 points
  - Player 2: 5 points

- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 0 points
  - Player 2: 3 points

- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 3 points
  - Player 2: 0 points

- If both players choose A1:
  - Player 1: 3 points
  - Player 2: 3 points

### Payoff Structure with Contract:
- If both players choose A0:
  - Player 1: 5 (base) + 1 (contract) = 6 points
  - Player 2: 5 (base) + 1 (contract) = 6 points

- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 0 (base) + 1 (contract) = 1 point
  - Player 2: 3 (base) - 1 (payment to Player 1) = 2 points

- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 3 (base) - 1 (payment to Player 2) = 2 points
  - Player 2: 0 (base) + 1 (contract) = 1 point

- If both players choose A1:
  - Player 1: 3 (base) - 1 (payment to Player 2) = 2 points
  - Player 2: 3 (base) - 1 (payment to Player 1) = 2 points

### Strategic Analysis with Contract:
The contract incentivizes players to choose A0 because it provides an additional positive payment for choosing A0 and an additional cost for choosing A1. This changes the expected payoff as follows:
- When both players aim to maximize their own points while considering the additional payment, choosing A0 becomes more attractive due to the extra point received.
- The Nash Equilibrium would likely shift from a potential mix of strategies or (A1, A1) scenario (without contract) to both players choosing (A0, A0) since they would both gain 6 points with the contract as opposed to 5 points without it.

### Conclusion:
Based on the adjustments in payoffs and the fact that the contract incentivizes mutually optimal behavior (both choosing A0), signing the contract appears beneficial. Both players get a higher reward, making it a Pareto improvement over the no-contract scenario.

### Final Answer:
Given these considerations, it would be rational to sign the contract because it maximizes the overall points you can receive in this context.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
Let's analyze the situation step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Basic Payoff Structure
First, consider the payoffs without the contract:

- If both players pick A0: each gets 5 points.
- If you pick A0 and the other player picks A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you pick A1 and the other player picks A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If both players pick A1: each gets 3 points.

### Step 2: Understand the Modified Payoff with the Contract
Now, let's see how the contract affects the payoffs:

- If you pick A0, you receive an additional 2 points from the other player.
- If you pick A1, you pay an additional 2 points to the other player.

This can be calculated as follows:

- If both players pick A0:
  - Each gets 5 points.
  - Each receives additional 2 points from the other.
  - Net gain is \(5 + 2 - 2 = 7\) points each.

- If you pick A0 and the other player picks A1:
  - You get 0 points.
  - You receive additional 2 points.
  - The other player gets 3 points.
  - The other player pays 2 points to you.
  - Net gain is \(0 + 2 = 2\) for you and \(3 - 2 = 1\) for the other player.

- If you pick A1 and the other player picks A0:
  - You get 3 points.
  - You pay 2 points.
  - The other player gets 0 points.
  - The other player receives 2 points from you.
  - Net gain is \(3 - 2 = 1\) for you and \(0 + 2 = 2\) for the other player.

- If both players pick A1:
  - Each gets 3 points.
  - Each pays 2 points to the other.
  - Net gain is \(3 - 2 + 2 - 2 = 1\) each.

### Step 3: Calculate Expected Payoffs
Let \( p \) be the probability of picking A0 and \( (1 - p) \) be the probability of picking A1. Assume the other player adopts the same strategy:

- **Without Contract:**

Expected payoff for you:
\[ 5p \cdot p + 0 \cdot p (1 - p) + 3 (1 - p) \cdot p + 3 (1 - p) \cdot (1 - p) \]
\[ = 5p^2 + 3(1-p)p + 3(1-p)^2 \]

Optimize to maximize by taking the derivative with respect to \( p \).

- **With Contract:**

Expected payoff for you:
\[ 7p \cdot p + 2p (1 - p) + 1 (1 - p) \cdot p + 1 (1 - p) \cdot (1 - p) \]
\[ = 7p^2 + 2p (1 - p) + 1 (1 - p) \cdot p + 1 (1 - p)^2 \]

Optimize to maximize by taking the derivative with respect to \( p \).

### Step 4: Compare the Scenarios
From our analysis, it's clear that:

- With the contract, picking A0 is always beneficial due to the guaranteed 2 points transfer, thus leading to higher points than playing without the contract.
- Without the contract, you would prefer the other player picking A0 for higher potential payoff but face uncertainties.

### Step 5: Final Decision
Considering both players likely aim to maximize their points and the transfer perks in the contract scenario, signing the contract provides a dominant strategy, optimizing the overall payout.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let's break down the game scenarios and the point outcomes with and without the contract.

### Standard Payoff Matrix (No Contract)

**Without the contract:**

|          | Other Player: A0 | Other Player: A1 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| You: A0  | 5, 5             | 0, 3             |
| You: A1  | 3, 0             | 3, 3             |

### Payoff Matrix with the Contract

With the contract, each player gets 4 additional points for A0, but these points are drawn from the other player. This means if you choose A0, you get 9 points (5 + 4), and the other player loses 4 points if they chose A0, leading to them getting 1 point (5 - 4). Similarly, if the other player chooses A0, they get 9 points, and you lose 4 points.

|          | Other Player: A0 | Other Player: A1 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| You: A0  | 9, 1             | 4, -1            |
| You: A1  | -1, 4            | 3, 3             |

### Expected Payoff Analysis

**Without the Contract (Original Scenario):**
- Mutual cooperation (A0, A0) leads to both players receiving 5 points.
- If one defects while the other cooperates:
  - (A0, A1) leads to you getting 0 points and the other getting 3 points.
  - (A1, A0) leads to you getting 3 points and the other getting 0 points.
- Mutual defection (A1, A1) leads to each player getting 3 points.

**With the Contract:**
- Mutual cooperation (A0, A0) is destabilized as:
  - (A0, A0) makes you gain 9 points and the other player get 1 point.
- Divergence:
  - (A0, A1) makes you gain 4 points and the other player lose 1 point.
  - (A1, A0) makes you lose 1 point and the other player gain 4 points.
- Mutual defection (A1, A1) still gives both 3 points each.

The new payoffs distort the original incentives. If both players act rationally considering the contract, they may no longer aim for mutual cooperation since they could improve their chances by defecting (A1) to avoid the 4-point loss while risking getting -1 for mutual divergence outcomes.

### Strategic Decision

Since signing the contract distorts the mutual cooperation (A0, A0) equilibrium:
- Without the contract, mutual cooperation maximizes mutual benefit (5 points each).
- With the contract, there are greater risks:
  - If both cooperate (A0, A0), it's beneficial, but this balance is unstable due to the point redistribution.

Given the instability and potential loss due to the contract's added complexity, it is advisable not to sign it to maintain the original stable payoff structure.

### Final Decision

Based on this analysis, the logical step would be to avoid signing the contract to maintain stable and predictable payoffs.

response:
Sure, let's break down the situation and analyze our optimal strategy step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding Payoffs Without Contract
First, let’s review the payoffs if there were no additional contract:

- (A0, A0): You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- (A0, A1): You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- (A1, A0): You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- (A1, A1): You get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

### Step 2: Understanding Payoffs With Contract
Now, consider how the contract affects these payoffs. The contract states:
- Choosing A0 adds 2 points to your payoff and removes 2 points from the other player's payoff.
- Choosing A1 removes 2 points from your payoff and adds 2 points to the other player's payoff.

This modifies the payoffs as follows:

- (A0, A0): You get 5 + 2 = 7 points; the other player gets 5 - 2 = 3 points.
- (A0, A1): You get 0 + 2 = 2 points; the other player gets 3 - 2 = 1 point.
- (A1, A0): You get 3 - 2 = 1 point; the other player gets 0 + 2 = 2 points.
- (A1, A1): You get 3 - 2 = 1 point; the other player gets 3 + 2 = 5 points.

### Step 3: Determining Strategy
Now that we know how the payoffs change with the contract, we can determine the strategy that maximizes our expected points. Let's consider the best responses based on these modified payoffs.

- **If the other player is likely to choose A0:**
  - By choosing A0, we get 7 points.
  - By choosing A1, we get 1 point.

  Here, A0 dominates since 7 > 1.

- **If the other player is likely to choose A1:**
  - By choosing A0, we get 2 points.
  - By choosing A1, we get 1 point.

  Here, A0 also dominates since 2 > 1.

### Step 4: Output the Probability Distribution
Since choosing A0 gives a higher expected payoff in both scenarios:

1. If the other player chooses A0, we get 7 points by choosing A0.
2. If the other player chooses A1, we get 2 points by choosing A0.

Choosing A1 yields fewer points in both cases. Therefore, the dominant strategy is to choose A0 with 100% probability.

### Final Answer:
```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

By following this strategy, we ensure that we maximize our points given the contract's constraints and the payoff table.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:

response:
Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Understand the base game equilibrium
2. Analyze each contract's impact
3. Determine which contracts benefit me

## Step 1: Base Game Analysis

Let me find the Nash equilibrium of the base game.

For me (Player 1):
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me 3 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 0, A1 gives me 3 → prefer A1

For the other player (symmetric game):
- If I play A0: A0 gives them 5, A1 gives them 0 → prefer A0  
- If I play A1: A0 gives them 3, A1 gives them 3 → indifferent

Using mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:
- I'm indifferent when: 5q = 3, so q = 3/5 (other's prob of A0)
- Other is indifferent when: 5p = 3, so p = 3/5 (my prob of A0)

**Base game equilibrium payoff: 3 for each player**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1 modifies payoffs as follows:
- When I choose A0: I receive +4 from other
- When other chooses A0: Other receives +4 from me

Modified payoff matrix:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 + 4 - 4 = 5, other gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 4 = 4, other gets 3 - 4 = -1
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 4 = -1, other gets 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1, A1): I get 3, other gets 3

Checking for dominant strategies:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5 vs A1 gives -1 → A0 dominates
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 4 vs A1 gives 3 → A0 dominates

**A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players!**
**Equilibrium: (A0, A0) with payoff 5 for me**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2:
- If I choose A0: I receive +2 from other
- If I choose A1: I pay 2 to other
- Same rules apply to the other player

Net payments:
- (A0, A0): I receive 2, pay 2 = 0 net
- (A0, A1): I receive 2, other pays me 2 = +4 net
- (A1, A0): I pay 2, other receives 2 = -4 net
- (A1, A1): I pay 2, other pays me 2 = 0 net

Modified payoff matrix:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 0 = 5
- (A0, A1): 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1, A0): 3 - 4 = -1
- (A1, A1): 3 + 0 = 3

**This is identical to Contract 1!**
**Equilibrium: (A0, A0) with payoff 5 for me**

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts:
- Transform the game so A0 becomes dominant for both players
- Lead to equilibrium (A0, A0) with payoff 5 for each player
- This is strictly better than the base game payoff of 3

Since both contracts give me the same improved outcome (5 vs 3), I should approve both.

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract or not, we need to analyze the payoffs with and without the contract in place. Let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Step 1: Payoffs without the Contract

Let's first look at the payoffs without a contract:

- If Player 2 (you) choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Payoff for Player 1: 5 points
  - Payoff for Player 2: 5 points

- If Player 2 (you) choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Payoff for Player 1: 3 points
  - Payoff for Player 2: 0 points

- If Player 2 (you) choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Payoff for Player 1: 0 points
  - Payoff for Player 2: 3 points

- If Player 2 (you) choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Payoff for Player 1: 3 points
  - Payoff for Player 2: 3 points

### Step 2: Payoffs with the Contract

Now let’s examine the updated payoffs if the contract is signed:

- If Player 2 (you) choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Payoff for Player 1: 5 + 4 (bonus for A0) - 4 (penalty as you chose A0) = 5 points
  - Payoff for Player 2: 5 + 4 (bonus for A0) - 4 (penalty to Player 1) = 5 points

- If Player 2 (you) choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Payoff for Player 1: 3 + 4 (bonus for Player 2 choosing A0) - 4 (penalty for Player 1 choosing A1) = 7 - 4 = 3 points
  - Payoff for Player 2: 0 + 4 (bonus for A0) - 4 (penalty as Player 1 chose A1) = 4 - 4 = 0 points

- If Player 2 (you) choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Payoff for Player 1: 0 + 4 (bonus for Player 1 choosing A0) - 4 (penalty for you choosing A1) = 4 - 4 = 0 points
  - Payoff for Player 2: 3 - 4 (penalty to Player 1 for choosing A0) = 3 points

- If Player 2 (you) choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Payoff for Player 1: 3 points
  - Payoff for Player 2: 3 points

### Step 3: Expected Payoff Calculation

Let's compare the optimal strategy in both scenarios (with and without contract):

#### Without Contract:
- A0 results in higher expected payoff if Player 1 is likely to choose A0.
- A1 results in a guaranteed 3 points in certain scenarios, which may be safer.

#### With Contract:
- Both players choosing A0 results in each player receiving 5 points.
- Deviating from A0 results in no change in payoff (still 3 points).

The contract makes mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) more rewarding by ensuring both players always get the optimal payoff (5 points), which simplifies the decision to cooperate.

### Step 4: Decision

Given that signing the contract ensures a more predictable and higher mutual payoff (5 points instead of 3 points in mutual A1 choice), it would be beneficial for both players to sign the contract.

### Final Decision

Here is the final decision in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sign": true
}
```

This decision allows for maximal mutual cooperation and guarantees a higher payoff when both choose A0.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Understand the Original Game
Without the contract, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This game has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) giving 5 points each (good outcome)
- (A1, A1) giving 3 points each (bad outcome)

There's a **coordination problem** - we might fail to coordinate on the better equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze the Contract
The contract specifies:
- Playing A0 → receive +4 points from the other player
- Playing A1 → no additional payment

## Step 3: Calculate New Payoffs with Contract
With the contract active:
- (A0, A0): (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = **(5, 5)**
- (A0, A1): (0+4, 3-4) = **(4, -1)**
- (A1, A0): (3-4, 0+4) = **(-1, 4)**
- (A1, A1): (3, 3) = **(3, 3)**

## Step 4: Find the Equilibrium with Contract
Let me check if A0 is a dominant strategy for me:
- If other plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: I get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1!**

By symmetry, A0 also dominates A1 for the other player.

## Step 5: Compare Outcomes
**Without contract:**
- Risk of coordination failure
- Might end at (A1, A1) for 3 points
- Expected payoff: uncertain, between 3-5

**With contract:**
- A0 becomes dominant strategy for both players
- Unique equilibrium at (A0, A0) 
- Guaranteed payoff: **5 points**

## Step 6: Decision
The contract:
✅ Preserves the best outcome (5 points)
✅ Eliminates the bad equilibrium
✅ Removes strategic uncertainty
✅ Makes cooperation the rational choice regardless of what the other player does

**Conclusion:** Signing the contract is beneficial because it guarantees the optimal outcome and eliminates coordination risk.

# Analysis

Let me break this down step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

Without the contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 5, other gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, other gets 3

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds: +4 points to whoever plays A0, paid by the other player.

With contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 5+4-4 = **5**, other gets 5+4-4 = **5**
  - Both get +4 for playing A0, both pay 4 to the other
- (A0, A1): I get 0+4 = **4**, other gets 3-4 = **-1**
  - I get +4 for A0, other pays me 4
- (A1, A0): I get 3-4 = **-1**, other gets 0+4 = **4**
  - I pay other 4 for their A0
- (A1, A1): I get **3**, other gets **3**
  - No payments

## Step 3: Analyze strategic implications

**With the contract**, from my perspective:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5 vs A1 gives me -1 → **A0 better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 4 vs A1 gives me 3 → **A0 better**

**A0 becomes a strictly dominant strategy for me!**

By symmetry, A0 also becomes strictly dominant for the other player.

## Step 4: Compare equilibria

**Without contract**: 
- Multiple Nash equilibria exist: (A0, A0) giving 5 each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 each
- Coordination risk - we might end up at the inferior (A1, A1) equilibrium

**With contract**:
- Unique Nash equilibrium: (A0, A0) giving 5 each
- No coordination risk - A0 is dominant for both players

## Step 5: Decision

The contract:
1. Guarantees the best outcome (5 points) by making A0 dominant
2. Eliminates coordination risk
3. Doesn't reduce my maximum achievable payoff
4. Makes rational play converge to the mutually beneficial outcome

**I should sign the contract.**

The contract adds: +4 points to whoever plays A0 (paid by the other player)

New payoffs with contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 5+4-4=5, other gets 5+4-4=5 (we both pay and receive 4)
- (A0, A1): I get 0+4=4, other gets 3-4=-1 (I receive 4 from other)
- (A1, A0): I get 3-4=-1, other gets 0+4=4 (I pay 4 to other)
- (A1, A1): I get 3, other gets 3 (no contract payments)

### Step 3: Analyze strategic implications

**With contract:**
- If other plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1 → I prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → I prefer A0

**A0 becomes a dominant strategy for me!** (and by symmetry, for the other player too)

This means with the contract, both players will rationally play A0, guaranteeing payoffs of 5 each.

### Step 4: Compare outcomes

**Without contract:**
- Multiple equilibria exist (pure: A0,A0 giving 5,5 and mixed strategy giving ~3,3)
- Risk of miscoordination or ending up in mixed strategy equilibrium
- Expected payoff: uncertain, potentially as low as 3

**With contract:**
- Unique dominant strategy equilibrium at (A0, A0)
- Guaranteed payoff: 5
- Eliminates coordination risk

### Conclusion

The contract serves as a coordination device that makes A0 dominant for both players, ensuring we achieve the best mutual outcome of 5 points each. Since the other player proposed this contract, they likely intend to sign it. Signing is clearly in my best interest.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
To solve this problem, we need to devise a strategy that maximizes our total points, factoring in the game rules, payoffs, and contract stipulations. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Game Setup and Payoffs**:
    - If Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2) both choose A0: P1 gets 5 points, P2 gets 5 points.
    - If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 0 points, P2 gets 3 points.
    - If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 3 points, P2 gets 0 points.
    - If both choose A1: Both players get 3 points.

2. **Contract Impact**:
    - Choosing A0 gives an additional 1 point from the other player.
    - Choosing A1 subtracts 1 point, given to the other player.
    
Now, let’s modify the payoffs according to the contract:

- **Modified payoffs** (including contract impact):
    - If both choose A0: P1 gets 6, P2 gets 4.
    - If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: P1 gets -1, P2 gets 4.
    - If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 4, P2 gets -1.
    - If both choose A1: Both get 2.

3. **Strategy Analysis**:
    - Both choosing A0 results in the highest net overall benefit (sum of payoffs: 10 points).
    - Choosing A1 leads to either 2 points each or a mix of 4 points and -1, which is less optimal in terms of maximizing total points.

Given the analysis:
- Both players maximizing their payoff would ideally aim to select A0 to ensure higher average points.

### Decision Based on Optimal Strategy

Given the calculations, both players should ideally choose A0 to maximize their points. However, realistically, some mixed strategy might also be plausible if there's uncertainty about the other player's actions. But pure strategy seems most rational based on the given payoff structure.

### Final Decision on Probability Distribution

To reflect a rational, optimal strategy derived from our analysis:

- Set a very high probability on A0: 100% and a very low probability on A1: 0%.

Here's the JSON object representing the derived strategy:

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

This is the most rational approach under the given circumstances to maximize the total points for Player 1.

1) Incorporate the contract as a transfer: if a player chooses **A0**, they **receive +4** and the other player **pays −4** (since there are only 2 players). If a player chooses **A1**, no transfer happens.

2) Compute my (Player 2) adjusted payoffs:

- **(A0, A0)**: base 5, both receive +4 and pay −4 ⇒ net transfer 0 ⇒ **5**
- **(A0, A1)**: base 0, I receive +4 from Player 1 ⇒ **4**
- **(A1, A0)**: base 3, I pay 4 to Player 1 ⇒ **−1**
- **(A1, A1)**: base 3, no transfers ⇒ **3**

3) Compare my actions:
- If Player 1 plays **A0**: A0 gives **5** vs A1 gives **−1** ⇒ prefer **A0**
- If Player 1 plays **A1**: A0 gives **4** vs A1 gives **3** ⇒ prefer **A0**

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**, meaning the best strategy is to always choose **A0**.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we must compare the potential outcomes of the game with and without the contract.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The basic payoffs (P1: other player, P2: you) are:
- (P1: A0, P2: A0): (5, 5)
- (P1: A0, P2: A1): (0, 3)
- (P1: A1, P2: A0): (3, 0)
- (P1: A1, P2: A1): (3, 3)

In this baseline game, there are two Nash Equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)** where both players receive 5 points.
- **(A1, A1)** where both players receive 3 points.

While (A0, A0) is the payoff-dominant equilibrium (better for both), the presence of two equilibria can sometimes lead to coordination failures or players settling for the less optimal (A1, A1) equilibrium.

### 2. Analysis with the Payment Contract
The contract specifies that any player who chooses A0 receives 4 points, and those points are drawn from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** Both choose A0. Each receives +4 and pays -4. Net change is 0. Payoffs stay **(5, 5)**.
- **(P1: A0, P2: A1):** P1 receives +4 from P2. P1's payoff becomes 0 + 4 = 4. P2's payoff becomes 3 - 4 = -1. Payoffs: **(4, -1)**.
- **(P1: A1, P2: A0):** P2 receives +4 from P1. P1's payoff becomes 3 - 4 = -1. P2's payoff becomes 0 + 4 = 4. Payoffs: **(-1, 4)**.
- **(P1: A1, P2: A1):** Neither receives or pays. Payoffs stay **(3, 3)**.

### 3. Comparison and Decision
In the contract-active game, P2’s strategy A0 is dominant:
- If P1 chooses A0, P2 gets 5 with A0 (vs. -1 with A1).
- If P1 chooses A1, P2 gets 4 with A0 (vs. 3 with A1).
The same applies to P1. Consequently, (A0, A0) becomes the **exclusive and dominant strategy Nash Equilibrium**.

By signing the contract:
- You ensure the game has a single, stable equilibrium at the highest possible payoff (5, 5).
- You protect yourself against the risk of the other player choosing A1 (if the contract is active, you still get 4 points instead of the 0 or 3 you might get otherwise).
- Since the contract only activates if both sign, there is no disadvantage to signing; if the other player doesn't sign, you simply return to the original game.

To maximize my total points, it is important to evaluate the payoffs and the potential strategies for both players. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze Payoff Matrix
The game has the following payoff matrix for Player 1:

|                 | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Player 1 A0** | 5 points         | 0 points        |
| **Player 1 A1** | 3 points         | 3 points        |

For the other player, the matrix is:
|                   | Player 1 A0    | Player 1 A1   |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Other Player A0** | 5 points       | 3 points      |
| **Other Player A1** | 0 points       | 3 points      |

### Step 2: Analyze the Best Responses

- **If I choose A0**:
  - If the other player chooses A0, we both get 5 points.
  - If the other player chooses A1, I get 0 points and they get 3 points.

- **If I choose A1**:
  - If the other player chooses A0, I get 3 points and they get 0 points.
  - If the other player chooses A1, we both get 3 points.

### Step 3: Determine Dominant Strategies
A dominant strategy is one that provides a player with a higher payoff regardless of the opponent's action:
- For Player 1:
  - Choosing A1 guarantees at least 3 points irrespective of the other player’s choice.
  - Choosing A0 only gives a higher payoff (5 points) if the other player also chooses A0, but it could result in 0 points otherwise.

Given that:
- A0 could yield 0 or 5 points.
- A1 yields consistently 3 points.

It seems choosing A1 is a safer and more stable strategy because it secures a higher minimum payoff (3 points instead of potentially 0 points).

### Step 4: Predicting the Other Player's Behavior
Since the other player understands the game just as I do, and knowing that I rejected the additional payment contract which changes incentives slightly, they might deduce that I favor the stability of A1 as well. Therefore, they might also lean towards choosing A1 for similar reasons.

### Step 5: Mixed Strategy Consideration
Despite the dominant strategy being A1, a mixed strategy could sometimes be beneficial to potentially confuse the other player. However, in this straightforward payoff setup, a mixed strategy might not be optimal if both players can deduce that A1 is the safe option.

### Step 6: Final Action Distribution
Given the analysis and the incentives aligned without the extra payment contract, I would choose:
- A1 with a higher probability because it guarantees 3 points irrespective of the other player’s action.

However, to mix it up slightly, I could play A0 with a very minimal probability to hedge against the chance that the other player might unexpectedly favor A0.

### Final Decision
Considering all the above, I'll go for:
- A slight edge towards A1, but with a very small chance assigned to A0.

Here is the JSON object on how I would distribute the probabilities:

{"A0": 10, "A1": 90}

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a symmetric 2-player game where each player chooses A0 or A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Payoff | Opponent's Payoff |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 5           | 5                 |
| A0          | A1                | 0           | 3                 |
| A1          | A0                | 3           | 0                 |
| A1          | A1                | 3           | 3                 |

We are playing **as Player 2**.

This is a classic coordination game with a **mixed Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s compute the Nash equilibrium in the base game.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability Player 1 plays A0
- $ q $ = probability Player 2 (you) plays A0

Your expected payoff from playing A0:
$$
EU(A0) = p \cdot 5 + (1 - p) \cdot 0 = 5p
$$

Your expected payoff from playing A1:
$$
EU(A1) = p \cdot 3 + (1 - p) \cdot 3 = 3
$$

You are indifferent when:
$$
5p = 3 \Rightarrow p = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
$$

So, if Player 1 plays A0 with probability 0.6, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Similarly, for Player 1 to be indifferent, they also need to play A0 with probability 0.6 (due to symmetry).

Thus, **Nash equilibrium: both players play A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with probability 0.4**.

Expected payoff for each player in equilibrium:

$$
EU = 0.6 \cdot 0.6 \cdot 5 + 0.6 \cdot 0.4 \cdot 0 + 0.4 \cdot 0.6 \cdot 3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.4 \cdot 3
$$
$$
= 0.36 \cdot 5 + 0 + 0.24 \cdot 3 + 0.16 \cdot 3 = 1.8 + 0.72 + 0.48 = 3.0
$$

So in the base game, **expected payoff per player is 3.0**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

A contract specifies **additional payments** based on your action:

- If you play A0: you get an additional **payment** (so gain extra points)
- If you play A1: you **pay** a penalty (lose points), and the money is distributed to others

The payment is **drawn equally from the other players**, meaning:
- The total cost of the penalty is split among the other players.
- The bonus is drawn equally from the other players.

But note: **You are playing as Player 2**, and we are reviewing two contracts:

- **C1**: Proposed by Player 1
- **C2**: Proposed by Player 2

We are to decide whether to **approve** each contract.

The winning contract is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So we must decide what's best for **us (Player 2)** — our goal is to **maximize our own expected points**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Each Contract**

Let’s evaluate each contract in terms of how it affects your (Player 2’s) expected payoff.

We assume both players will **rationalize and play optimally** under the contract, and will choose strategies to maximize their own final expected payoff.

We are to decide which contracts would **make us better off**.

---

#### **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1**

> - If a player chooses A0: +1 point (drawn equally from others)
> - If a player chooses A1: -1 point (distributed equally to others)

So each player gets:
- +1 if they play A0
- -1 if they play A1
- The money is split equally among the others

For **you (Player 2)**, the **additional** payoff from a choice depends on:
- Your action
- Your opponent's action

Let’s model the **effect on your expected payoff** when C1 is in effect.

Note: When you play A0, you gain +1, but you also pay part of the cost to others — but wait.

Let’s be careful.

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

This means: **you get +1**, and the **other player pays** the 1 point (in total) to you.

Similarly, **if you choose A1**, you **pay 1 point**, and **the other player receives** that 1 point.

So for **you**:

- If you play A0 → you gain +1, and the other player loses 1 (since they pay for it)
- If you play A1 → you lose 1, and the other player gains 1

But note: the payment is drawn **from the others**, so:
- If **you** play A0: you get +1, and **your opponent** pays 1 → his total payoff decreases by 1, yours increases by 1
- If **you** play A1: you lose 1, opponent gains 1

Thus, **this contract is symmetric** — both players are affected the same way.

So your **total payoff** is the base payoff **plus**:
- +1 if you play A0
- -1 if you play A1

Now let’s see how this changes the game.

Let’s define:

- $ q $: your (Player 2) probability of playing A0
- $ p $: Player 1’s probability of playing A0

**Your total expected payoff (with C1):**

$$
EU_{\text{you}} = \text{base payoff} + \text{contract bonus}
$$

We compute it over the four combinations:

| You | Opponent | Base Payoff | Contract Bonus (to you) | Total |
|-----|----------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|
| A0  | A0       | 5           | +1                       | 6     |
| A0  | A1       | 0           | +1                       | 1     |
| A1  | A0       | 3           | -1                       | 2     |
| A1  | A1       | 3           | -1                       | 2     |

So:

$$
EU_{\text{your total}} = q \cdot p \cdot 6 + q \cdot (1-p) \cdot 1 + (1-q) \cdot p \cdot 2 + (1-q) \cdot (1-p) \cdot 2
$$

Let’s simplify:

$$
= 6qp + q(1-p) + 2(1-q)p + 2(1-q)(1-p)
$$

Break it down:

- $ 6qp $
- $ q - qp $
- $ 2p - 2qp $
- $ 2(1 - q - p + qp) = 2 - 2q - 2p + 2qp $

Now sum:

$$
= 6qp + q - qp + 2p - 2qp + 2 - 2q - 2p + 2qp
$$

Combine like terms:

- $ qp $ terms: $ 6 -1 -2 +2 = 5qp $
- $ q $ terms: $ q - 2q = -q $
- $ p $ terms: $ 2p - 2p = 0 $
- Constants: $ +2 $

So:

$$
EU_{\text{you}} = 5qp - q + 2
$$

Now find the best response: for a fixed $ p $, what $ q $ maximizes this?

Take derivative w.r.t $ q $:

$$
\frac{dEU}{dq} = 5p - 1
$$

- If $ 5p - 1 > 0 \Rightarrow p > 0.2 $, then increase $ q $
- If $ p < 0.2 $, decrease $ q $
- If $ p = 0.2 $, indifferent

So:
- $ q = 1 $ if $ p > 0.2 $
- $ q = 0 $ if $ p < 0.2 $
- Any $ q $ if $ p = 0.2 $

Now suppose symmetric equilibrium: both play same strategy.

Assume $ p = q $

Then: Best response for you is $ q = 1 $ if $ p > 0.2 $, $ q = 0 $ if $ p < 0.2 $

So for symmetric equilibrium: try $ p = 0.2 $ → then $ 5p - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 $, so any $ q $ is best response?

Wait, if $ p = 0.2 $, then $ q $ doesn’t matter — marginal utility is zero.

Try $ q = 0.2 $: then $ p = 0.2 $

Now check if both are best responses.

Player 1’s expected payoff (same symmetry):

$$
EU_{\text{P1}} = 5pq - p + 2
$$

Same form. So at $ p = q = 0.2 $, both are indifferent.

But wait: at $ p = 0.2 $, marginal change is zero, so it's a best response.

But is it an equilibrium? Yes, because if both play $ p = 0.2 $, then each is indifferent, so any $ q $ is best response.

But is there a better equilibrium?

Let’s suppose $ p = 0.2 $, then you are indifferent — so you can choose any $ q $.

Suppose you play $ q = 0.5 $, then $ p = 0.2 $. But is Player 1 indifferent? Only if $ p = 0.2 $

But the idea is: the game has multiple equilibria.

But we are looking for **what expected payoff you get** in equilibrium.

Let’s suppose we go to the symmetric one where $ p = q = 0.2 $

Then your expected total payoff:

$$
EU = 5 \cdot (0.2) \cdot (0.2) - 0.2 + 2 = 5 \cdot 0.04 - 0.2 + 2 = 0.2 - 0.2 + 2 = 2.0
$$

But wait — is that the only equilibrium?

Suppose $ p > 0.2 $, then you want $ q = 1 $. Then if you play $ q = 1 $, Player 1 faces:

If Player 1 plays A0: your payoff (you) is 6 → then Player 1’s payoff: base + contract.

Player 1’s total payoff:

| His Action | Your Action | Base (P1) | Contract | Total |
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| A0         | A0          | 5         | +1       | 6     |
| A0         | A1          | 0         | +1       | 1     |
| A1         | A0          | 3         | -1       | 2     |
| A1         | A1          | 3         | -1       | 2     |

So if you play A0 (q=1), then P1’s expected payoff:
- $ p \cdot 6 + (1-p) \cdot 1 = 6p + 1 - p = 5p + 1 $

Best response: maximize $ 5p + 1 $ → always play A0 → p = 1

If p = 1, then you (Player 2) face:

- If you play A0: payoff = 6 (since P1 plays A0)
- If you play A1: payoff = 2 (since P1 plays A0)

So you prefer A0 → q = 1

So: $ p = 1, q = 1 $ → is this a Nash equilibrium?

Check:
- If P1 plays A0, you prefer A0 (6 > 2) → yes
- If you play A0, P1 prefers A0 (6 > 1) → yes

So (A0, A0) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium under C1.

Similarly, check (A1, A1): if both play A1:
- You get base 3, contract: -1 → total 2
- Opponent gets 3 -1 = 2

But if you deviate to A0, while P1 plays A1: you get base 0, contract +1 → total 1 < 2 → so not profitable.

Wait: in (A1, A1): you get 3 + (-1) = 2

If you deviate to A0: you get base 0, plus +1 → total 1 < 2 → so no incentive

Similarly, P1: deviating to A0 while you play A1 → gets base 0, contract +1 → total 1 < 2 → no incentive

So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

Now compare:

- (A0, A0): both get total payoff = 5 (base) + 1 (contract) = **6**
- (A1, A1): both get 3 (base) + (-1) = **2**

So (A0, A0) is better.

And we already saw that (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

Also, at $ p = q = 0.2 $, you get only 2.0, which is worse than 6.

So likely, the **efficient equilibrium** where both coordinate on A0 will be chosen (if both players are rational and expect others to play A0, they’d want to too).

But is there a risk of coordination failure?

Well, in game theory, we often assume players play **equilibria**.

But note: (A0, A0) is a dominant strategy equilibrium under C1?

Wait — for Player 2:
- If Opponent plays A0:
  - You: A0 → 6, A1 → 2 → prefer A0
- If Opponent plays A1:
  - You: A0 → 1, A1 → 2 → prefer A1

So not dominant.

But still: in equilibrium, it's possible that both go to A0.

Moreover, there is a **strong incentive to coordinate** on A0 because you both get 6 there.

In contrast, A1,A1 gives only 2.

So it's plausible that both players **coordinate on A0** if they can coordinate.

But **can they?**

Note: the base game doesn’t coordinate on A0 (because of risk of being exploited), but under C1, A0 is better.

In fact, A0 is better in **both** cases:
- If opponent plays A0: 6 > 2
- If opponent plays A1: 1 vs 2 → you prefer A1

Wait! If opponent plays A1, you prefer A1 (1 vs 2) — so if you think opponent will play A1, you play A1.

But if they play A0, you play A0.

So no dominant strategy.

But now let’s think: suppose both players are rational and know this.

They might play mixed strategies or coordinate.

But in **symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium**, we had earlier at $ p = q = 0.2 $

But we already see that (A0,A0) is a better equilibrium.

So **depending on expectations**, the game might converge to (A0,A0).

But to be consistent, let’s compute **expected payoff under the symmetric mixed equilibrium** where both play A0 with q = 0.2

We already computed:
$$
EU_{\text{you}} = 5 \cdot (0.2) \cdot (0.2) - 0.2 + 2 = 0.2 - 0.2 + 2 = 2.0
$$

But if the players coordinate on (A0,A0), you get 6, which is much better.

But since the contract is **binding only if approved**, and both players are rational, they may coordinate.

But here’s the key: **you want to maximize your own payoff**, so you should **approve a contract only if it increases your expected payoff**.

But we don’t know whether players will coordinate.

But **in game theory**, we assume equilibrium.

So we should look for **equilibrium outcomes**.

So under C1, possible equilibria:

1. (A0, A0): both get 6
2. (A1, A1): both get 2
3. Mixed equilibrium at p=q=0.2: expected payoff = 2.0

So if players play **any equilibrium**, you could get 6, 2, or 2.

But since (A0,A0) gives 6, which is higher than anything else, and both players benefit from it, **it’s a focal point**.

Is there any reason to avoid it?

No — so likely, if the contract is in place, rational players would **coordinate on A0**.

Thus, under C1, **you can expect to get 6**.

Compare to base game: expected payoff was 3.0

So **C1 increases your expected payoff from 3.0 to 6.0**.

But **only if coordination on A0 happens**.

But wait: in the **base game**, (A0,A0) is not an equilibrium because:
- If opponent plays A0, you prefer A0 → good
- But if opponent plays A1, you prefer A1 → so you’re afraid

But under C1, if you play A0 and opponent plays A1:
- You get 1 point (0 + 1)
- Opponent gets 0 + 1 = 1

In base game, you'd get 0 — so now you get a bonus.

But still: if opponent plays A1, you get 1 for A0, 2 for A1 → so prefer A1.

But again, if you **both** think the other will play A0, you’ll both choose A0.

With the contract, the **payoff is higher for A0** in the case where opponent plays A0 (6 vs 5), and only slightly worse if opponent plays A1 (1 vs 0).

But in case opponent plays A1, you prefer A1 anyway.

So the **threat of A1 is less bad** under C1.

In fact, **C1 makes A0 more attractive** when you expect A0 from opponent.

It **reduces the risk** of playing A0.

So likely, coordination is more stable.

Thus, **C1 leads to a higher expected payoff for you** — probably 6.

But let’s hold this and compare to C2.

---

#### **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2 (You)**

> - If a player chooses A0: +1 point (drawn equally from others)
> - If a player chooses A1: -2 points (distributed equally to others)

So:
- If you play A0: get +1
- If you play A1: pay -2 → lose 2

For **you (Player 2)**:
- A0: +1 bonus
- A1: -2 penalty

Now compute total payoff:

| You | Opponent | Base | Contract | Total |
|-----|----------|------|----------|-------|
| A0  | A0       | 5    | +1       | 6     |
| A0  | A1       | 0    | +1       | 1     |
| A1  | A0       | 3    | -2       | 1     |
| A1  | A1       | 3    | -2       | 1     |

Now compute your expected total payoff:

$$
EU = q p \cdot 6 + q (1-p) \cdot 1 + (1-q) p \cdot 1 + (1-q)(1-p) \cdot 1
$$

Simplify:

- $ 6qp $
- $ q - qp $
- $ p - qp $
- $ 1 - q - p + qp $

Sum:
- $ 6qp + q - qp + p - qp + 1 - q - p + qp $
- Combine:
  - $ qp $: 6 -1 -2 +1 = **4qp**
  - $ q $: +q - q = 0
  - $ p $: +p - p = 0
  - Constant: +1

So:
$$
EU = 4qp + 1
$$

Now, find best response.

Derivative w.r.t $ q $: $ 4p $

Since $ 4p > 0 $ for $ p > 0 $, you **always want q = 1**, no matter what p is.

**So no matter what the opponent does, you strictly prefer to play A0.**

Similarly, for Player 1:
- His expected payoff:
  - A0: gets +1 if he plays A0
  - A1: pays -2 if he plays A1

So:
| P1 | You | Base | Contract | Total |
|----|-----|------|----------|-------|
| A0 | A0 | 5    | +1       | 6     |
| A0 | A1 | 0    | +1       | 1     |
| A1 | A0 | 3    | -2       | 1     |
| A1 | A1 | 3    | -2       | 1     |

Wait — **you are playing A0 with probability 1** (if contract is in place)

So Player 1 knows you play A0

Then:
- If he plays A0: gets 5 (base) + 1 = 6
- If he plays A1: gets 0 (base) + 1 = 1

So he prefers A0 → p = 1

Thus, **(A0, A0) is the unique Nash equilibrium**

And you both get total payoff: 6

Now compare to base game: 3.0

So under C2, you get **6**

Even better than in C1? Same in this case — 6.

But let’s see:

In C1, we had **multiple equilibria**, including (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), but (A0,A0) is focal and likely.

In C2, **(A0,A0) is the only Nash equilibrium** → so **no coordination failure**.

So under C2, you are **guaranteed** to get 6.

Under C1, there is **risk** of (A1,A1) equilibrium where you get only 2.

But in C1, there is also a **dominant punishment**: if you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 1 instead of 0 — better.

But still, (A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

In fact, check if (A1,A1) is still equilibrium under C1:

- You play A1: get 2 (3-1)
- If you deviate to A0: get 1 (0+1) < 2 → no incentive
- Same for opponent

So yes, (A1,A1) is still a Nash equilibrium.

So if players coordinate poorly, you get 2.

But in C2, (A1,A1) is not an equilibrium.

Check under C2: if you play A1, you get 1 (base 3, penalty -2)

If you deviate to A0: base 0, bonus +1 → 1 → same

So if opponent plays A1, you are indifferent between A0 and A1

Similarly, if opponent plays A0, you prefer A0: 6 > 1

But if opponent plays A1, you get 1 from either action.

So **if the opponent plays A1**, you are indifferent.

So (A1,A1) is **weakly** an equilibrium?

Let’s check:

- You: play A1 → get 1
- Deviate to A0 → get 1 → same → so no incentive to deviate → so (A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium (weak)

But now, if you believe opponent will play A1, you are indifferent → so you might play A1.

Thus, **(A1,A1) is still a Nash equilibrium**, but it’s **not strict**.

But (A0,A0) is strict.

But because (A1,A1) is still a NE, there is still a risk.

But in C1, (A1,A1) is also a NE.

Wait — in C2, is (A1,A1) a NE?

- You: play A1 → get 1
- Deviate to A0: get 1 → no gain → so no incentive → yes, NE

So both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are NE.

But under C2, your **best response** is to play A0 **if you believe opponent plays anything with positive probability of A0**.

But if opponent plays A1 for sure, you are indifferent.

But if opponent plays A1, you get 1 either way.

But under C1, if opponent plays A1, you get 1 for A0, 2 for A1 → so you prefer A1.

But under C2, you get 1 in both cases.

So under C1, if opponent plays A1, you prefer A1.

Under C2, indifferent.

So in C1, (A1,A1) is more stable.

But in **C2**, because you are indifferent when opponent plays A1, but prefer A0 when opponent plays A0, and the only way to get 6 is to play A0, and only if opponent also plays A0.

But if you expect opponent to play A0, you play A0.

But opponent knows you play A0 → so he plays A0.

So (A0,A0) is a focal equilibrium.

(A1,A1) is less attractive because you get only 1, but in C1 you get 2.

So under C2, (A1,A1) gives 1, under C1 gives 2 → so C1 makes (A1,A1) more stable.

But in your case, **you want to maximize your expected payoff**.

Now, let’s consider the risk.

**In C2:**
- If players coordinate: you get 6
- If they don’t: you get 1
- But since you are proposing C2, and you are rational, you might expect that **both players will play A0**, because it’s best.

But in C1, you can get 6 or 2.

But 6 > 2, so **expected payoff depends on belief**.

But if both players are rational and expect each other to play A0, then (A0,A0) will be played.

But in C2, because the penalty for A1 is higher, the cost of deviating is higher, so players have stronger incentive to play A0.

But still, **in both contracts, (A0,A0) is a possible outcome**.

But in **C1**, there is a **real risk** that players end up in (A1,A1), getting only 2.

In **C2**, they get only 1 if in (A1,A1), so **worse** payoff in that case.

But since (A1,A1) is suboptimal, and (A0,A0) gives 6, it’s still likely to occur.

But here's the key difference:

In **C1**, if you play A0 and opponent plays A1: you get 1

In **C2**, you get 1 as well

But in C1, if you play A1 and opponent plays A1: you get 2

In C2: you get 1

So C2 hurts you in A1,A1 case.

But you **prefer** (A0,A0)

So **if coordination happens, both C1 and C2 give 6**.

But **if coordination fails**, C1 gives 2, C2 gives 1 → so C1 is better in failure case.

But you are choosing **whether to approve**.

Now, you are **Player 2**, and **C2 is proposed by you**.

You want to know: **do you want to approve C2?**

But the contract is **only effective if both approve**.

But here’s the catch:

- C1 is proposed by **Player 1**
- C2 is proposed by **you**

So you are deciding: **do you approve C1?** (even though it's not yours)

**Do you approve C2?** (yours)

Now, your goal is to **maximize your points**, so you should approve a contract only if it **increases your expected payoff**.

But under **C1**, you can get 6 (if coordination) or 2 (if not) — expected depends on beliefs.

But let’s assume that **players will coordinate on the best equilibrium** — that’s standard.

Even though (A1,A1) exists, it’s worse.

So likely, if C1 is approved, both will play (A0,A0) → you get 6.

Similarly, if C2 is approved, both play (A0,A0) → you get 6.

So both give you 6.

But **in C1**, there is **risk** of (A1,A1) equilibrium.

In C2, there is **slightly lower** payoff in A1,A1 (1 vs 2).

But **C1** gives **higher payoff in the failure case**.

But **you have more control over C2**.

But you are trying to **maximize your own payoff**.

Let’s compare:

- Base game: 3.0
- C1: can get 6 (if coordination), 2 (if not)
- C2: can get 6 (if coordination), 1 (if not)

So **both are better** than base game, **but C1 has higher worst-case payoff**.

But **you are the one deciding to approve**.

Now, **if you approve C1**, you get **6 if it passes** (assuming coordination).

Similarly, if you approve C2, you get **6**.

But note: **C2 is designed to make A1 cost more**, so **you are forcing a higher penalty for A1**, which makes you **less exposed to A1 actions**.

But **in both cases, you end up at A0,A0**, so it's the same.

But **is C2 better for you**?

Wait — in C1, if Player 1 plays A0, you get 6
If Player 1 plays A1, you get 1

In C2, if Player 1 plays A0, you get 6
If Player 1 plays A1, you get 1

Same — so no difference.

But in C1, if you play A1 and Player 1 plays A1, you get 2
In C2, you get 1 — so C1 is better for you in that case.

So **C1 is better for you in all cases where A1 is played**.

And in the case where both play A1, C1 gives 2, C2 gives 1.

So **C1 is better for you in every possible scenario**.

Therefore, **you should want C1 to pass**.

But C1 is proposed by **Player 1**, and you are deciding whether to approve it.

And C2 is yours.

Now, if you **approve C2**, you make sure that **A1 is punished more**, which might help **coordinate on A0**.

But since **C1 already makes A0 better**, and gives you higher payoff in failure case, **C1 is strictly better for you** in every outcome.

Therefore, **you should prefer C1 to C2**.

Even though you proposed C2, **C1 gives you higher payoff**.

So:

- If you **approve C1**: you get 6 (likely)
- If you **approve C2**: you get 6 (likely), but C1 is better

Now, there's a twist: the **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the maximum number of approvals.

So if you **approve both C1 and C2**, and **Player 1 approves C1**, then:
- C1 has 2 approvals (yours and P1)
- C2 has 1 approval (yours)
- So C1 wins
- You get 6

If you **approve only C1**, and P1 approves C1, then C1 wins, you get 6

If you **approve only C2**, and P1 approves C1, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 — C1 wins.

But if **Player 1 does not approve C1**, then only C2 might pass.

But we don't know what P1 will do.

But you are to decide your approvals to **maximize your own expected payoff**.

But you must assume that Player 1 will **approve C1** only if it benefits him.

And **C1 is good for Player 1 too**: symmetric.

So likely, Player 1 will approve C1.

But if you **don’t approve C1**, and only approve C2, then even if Player 1 approves C1, C1 has more approvals → still wins.

But if you **approve both**, then you get C1 (likely).

But if you **only approve C1**, you still get C1.

So no difference.

But the **key point**: **C1 is better for you than C2 in all scenarios**, so you should **prefer C1**.

Therefore, you should **approve C1**.

You should **not approve C2**, because:
- It gives you the same or worse payoff in all outcomes
- It is worse for you in the failure case

Moreover, you are proposing C2, but **if C2 passes**, you get only 6, but in failure case you get 1 — worse than C1's 2.

But **C1 already gives you 6 and better failure outcome**.

So **C2 is dominated by C1 for you**.

Therefore, **you should approve only C1**.

But what if C2 passes? You still get 6 — but worse than C1.

So better to have C1 pass.

But you can’t force C1 to pass — but by approving C1, you help it pass.

By **not approving C2**, you don’t hurt C1.

So optimal: **approve C1**, **do not approve C2**

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's analyze the decision step by step to determine whether signing the contract is beneficial for Player 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Baseline Payoffs Without the Contract:**  
   Evaluate the payoffs without the contract to have a baseline:
   - If both choose A0: Player 1 gets 5 points, Player 2 gets 5 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
   - If both choose A1: Both players get 3 points.

2. **Impact of the Contract:**  
   The contract alters the points by adding 1 point to A0 and subtracting 1 point from A1:
   - If a player plays A0, they get +1 point; if they play A1, they get -1 point.
   - The net effect on the payoffs:
     - If both choose A0: Player 1 gets \(5 + 1 = 6\), Player 2 gets \(5 + 1 = 6\).
     - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets \(0 + 1 = 1\), Player 2 gets \(3 - 1 = 2\).
     - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets \(3 - 1 = 2\), Player 2 gets \(0 + 1 = 1\).
     - If both choose A1: Both players get \(3 - 1 = 2\).

3. **Comparing the Outcomes:**
   - Without Contract:
     - A0-A0: (5, 5)
     - A0-A1: (0, 3)
     - A1-A0: (3, 0)
     - A1-A1: (3, 3)
   - With Contract:
     - A0-A0: (6, 6)
     - A0-A1: (1, 2)
     - A1-A0: (2, 1)
     - A1-A1: (2, 2)

4. **Decision-Making:**
   - Under the contract, mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) becomes even more favorable as it yields the highest combined payoff (12 points versus the next best 4 points total if both choose A1).
   - Compared to the baseline, the contract also improves the worst-case scenario payoff. The lowest payoff for either player is 1 point (in the scenarios where only one player chooses A0), while without the contract, the lowest payoff is 0 points.

5. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - The highest combined gain (both choosing A0) is more likely to occur under the contract since it becomes the dominant strategy. The contract encourages cooperation because deviating from A0 results in a lower payoff irrespective of what the other player chooses.

### Final Decision
Since the contract leads to higher potential rewards and less risk, it is beneficial for both players to sign. Therefore, Player 1 should sign the contract.

Here's the final JSON object representing the decision:

Let me work through this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the base payoffs

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5 points
- (A0, A1): I get 0 points  
- (A1, A0): I get 3 points
- (A1, A1): I get 3 points

## Step 2: Apply the contract modifications

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments

So the modified payoffs become:

- **(A0, A0)**: I get 5 + 4 (I chose A0) - 4 (other chose A0) = **5 points**
- **(A0, A1)**: I get 0 + 4 (I chose A0) - 0 (other chose A1) = **4 points**
- **(A1, A0)**: I get 3 + 0 (I chose A1) - 4 (other chose A0) = **-1 points**
- **(A1, A1)**: I get 3 + 0 (I chose A1) - 0 (other chose A1) = **3 points**

## Step 3: Analyze optimal strategy

My modified payoff matrix:
```
              Other A0    Other A1
My A0            5           4
My A1           -1           3
```

Let me check if one action dominates the other:
- A0 vs other's A0: 5 > -1 (A0 is better)
- A0 vs other's A1: 4 > 3 (A0 is better)

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - no matter what the other player does, I'm always better off choosing A0.

## Step 4: Verify expected payoff

If the other player chooses A0 with probability p:
- Expected payoff from A0: 5p + 4(1-p) = p + 4
- Expected payoff from A1: -1p + 3(1-p) = 3 - 4p

For all p ∈ [0,1], we have p + 4 ≥ 4 > 3 ≥ 3 - 4p, so A0 is always better.

## Conclusion

Since A0 strictly dominates A1, the optimal strategy is to choose A0 with 100% probability.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 4 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
Looking at this problem, I need to analyze how each contract affects the game outcomes and my expected payoff as Player 2.

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

From my perspective (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

The base game has (A0, A0) as a Pareto-optimal outcome where both players get 5. However, (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium where both get 3.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

Under C1, modified payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 + 1 - 1 = 5 (I receive 1 for playing A0, pay 1 to opponent who also played A0)
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 (I receive 1 for A0, receive 1 from opponent's A1 penalty)
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 (I pay 1 for A1, pay 1 to opponent's A0 reward)
- (A1, A1): I get 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 (I pay 1 for A1, receive 1 from opponent's A1 penalty)

Testing risk dominance: If opponent plays A0 with probability 0.5:
- My payoff from A0: 5(0.5) + 2(0.5) = 3.5
- My payoff from A1: 1(0.5) + 3(0.5) = 2

A0 is still better, but the advantage is reduced compared to the base game.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

Under C2, modified payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 (no additional payments)
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 4 = 4 (opponent pays 4 for playing A1)
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 4 = -1 (I pay 4 for playing A1)
- (A1, A1): I get 3 - 4 + 4 = 3 (both pay 4 to each other)

Testing risk dominance: If opponent plays A0 with probability 0.5:
- My payoff from A0: 5(0.5) + 4(0.5) = 4.5
- My payoff from A1: -1(0.5) + 3(0.5) = 1

A0 is strongly preferred! The heavy penalty for A1 makes (A0, A0) much more attractive.

## Step 4: Compare contracts

**No contract**: (A0, A0) gives payoff 5, but there's risk of coordinating on the inferior (A1, A1) equilibrium

**C1**: Makes the game more balanced but reduces the attractiveness of (A0, A0) relative to no contract. This could make coordination harder.

**C2**: Strongly incentivizes (A0, A0) by harshly penalizing A1. This makes the efficient outcome much more likely and risk-dominant.

## Conclusion

C2 is clearly beneficial as it makes (A0, A0) the focal and risk-dominant equilibrium. C1 actually weakens the incentive to coordinate on (A0, A0) compared to no contract, making it undesirable.

response:
To decide whether to sign the payment contract, let's analyze the situation step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix Without the Contract
Here is the payoff matrix without considering the contract:
- If both players choose A0, both get 5 points each.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you get 0 points and the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, you get 3 points and the other player gets 0 points.
- If both players choose A1, both get 3 points each.

### Step 2: Understand the Payoff Matrix With the Contract
The contract states that if a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 4 points, distributed equally among the other players. This means that the net effect is each player choosing A1 will lose 4 points and the other will gain 2 points.

Let's adjust the payoff matrix:
- If both players choose A0, both get 5 points each.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you get 2 points (0 + 2) and the other player gets -1 points (3 - 4).
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, you get -1 points (3 - 4) and the other player gets 2 points (0 + 2).
- If both players choose A1, both get -1 points (3 - 4 + 2).

### Step 3: Evaluate the Dominant Strategies
- Without the contract, choosing A0 guarantees you 5 points if the other player also chooses A0. Choosing A1 gives you uncertainty but a potential upside.
- With the contract, the incentives change significantly:
  - Choosing A0 guarantees 5 points if the other player also chooses A0.
  - Choosing A1, however, results in a net loss for both players and is not beneficial.

### Step 4: Best Response Analysis
Without the contract:
- If the other player is likely to choose A0, your best response is A0.
- If the other player is likely to choose A1, your best response could be A1 for a competitive gain.

With the contract:
- Choosing A1 is strongly disincentivized because it results in a net loss for you.
- The optimal strategy under mutual cooperation is for both players to choose A0, avoiding the penalty associated with A1.

### Step 5: Final Decision
Given that the contract heavily penalizes the action A1 for both players, and mutual A0 choices are optimal with the highest guaranteed payout (5 points each), it is beneficial to sign the contract.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs

Without the contract, my payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract states: choosing A0 gives +4 points from the other player.

Since there are 2 players, "drawn equally from other players" means the one other player pays the full 4 points.

New payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 4 (I receive) - 4 (I pay) = **5**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 4 (I receive) = **4**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 4 (I pay) = **-1**
- (A1, A1): 3 (no change) = **3**

## Step 3: Analyze the game WITH contract

Let me check if I have a dominant strategy:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → **A0 is better**

**A0 becomes a dominant strategy!** The same logic applies to the other player.

With contract: Unique equilibrium at (A0, A0) with payoff = **5**

## Step 4: Analyze the game WITHOUT contract

Checking for Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): payoff (5,5) - neither player wants to deviate → **Nash equilibrium**
- (A1, A1): payoff (3,3) - neither player wants to deviate → **Nash equilibrium**

Without contract: Two pure Nash equilibria with payoffs of **5 or 3**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

**Without contract:** 
- Risk of coordinating on the worse equilibrium (A1, A1) → payoff of 3
- Even in mixed strategy equilibrium, expected payoff ≈ 3.48

**With contract:**
- Guaranteed dominant strategy equilibrium (A0, A0) → payoff of 5
- No coordination risk

## Conclusion

The contract eliminates coordination risk and guarantees the best possible outcome (5 points) by making A0 a dominant strategy for both players. There is no downside.

To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, let's analyze the game step by step, considering both the original payoffs and the additional contract.

### 1. Identify the Original Payoffs (Row = Player 1, Column = Player 2)
*   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 3)
*   (A1, A0): (3, 0)
*   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### 2. Apply the Contract Rules
The contract states:
*   If a player chooses **A0**, they receive an additional **4 points**, taken from the other player.
*   If a player chooses **A1**, no additional points are transferred.

**Calculating new payoffs:**
*   **Case (A0, A0):**
    *   Player 1 gets +4 from Player 2, and Player 2 gets +4 from Player 1.
    *   Net change for each player is zero.
    *   Final: (5, 5)
*   **Case (A0, A1):**
    *   Player 1 gets +4 from Player 2. Player 2 pays 4.
    *   Final: (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = (4, -1)
*   **Case (A1, A0):**
    *   Player 2 gets +4 from Player 1. Player 1 pays 4.
    *   Final: (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = (-1, 4)
*   **Case (A1, A1):**
    *   No transfers occur.
    *   Final: (3, 3)

### 3. Analyze the Modified Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2)
| | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **Player 1: A1** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

### 4. Determine the Optimal Strategy
We look for the dominant strategy for Player 2 (the column player):
*   If Player 1 chooses **A0**, Player 2 earns **5** (by choosing A0) or **-1** (by choosing A1). **A0 is better.**
*   If Player 1 chooses **A1**, Player 2 earns **4** (by choosing A0) or **3** (by choosing A1). **A0 is better.**

Since A0 provides a higher payoff regardless of Player 1's action, **A0 is the strictly dominant strategy** for Player 2. The same logic applies to Player 1, making (A0, A0) the Nash equilibrium.

### Final Conclusion
Choosing A0 maximizes safety and potential points under the contract.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 4 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the Base Game

The payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) 
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria:
1. **(A0, A0)** yielding (5, 5) - the efficient outcome
2. **(A1, A1)** yielding (3, 3) - the safe but inferior outcome

There's also a mixed strategy equilibrium. Finding when I'm indifferent:
- If opponent plays A0 with probability p: EU(A0) = 5p, EU(A1) = 3
- Indifference at 5p = 3, so p = 0.6

At the mixed Nash equilibrium (both playing A0 with prob 0.6), my expected payoff is:
**0.36(5) + 0.24(0) + 0.24(3) + 0.16(3) = 3 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

"If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 from the other player"

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = **(5, 5)**
- (A0, A1): (0+4, 3-4) = **(4, -1)**
- (A1, A0): (3-4, 0+4) = **(-1, 4)**
- (A1, A1): **(3, 3)**

Now checking if A0 dominates:
- If opponent plays A0: A0 gives 5, A1 gives -1 → A0 better
- If opponent plays A1: A0 gives 4, A1 gives 3 → A0 better

**A0 is now a dominant strategy!** Both players will choose A0, yielding **(5, 5)**.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

"If a player chooses A1, they pay -4 to the other player"

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): **(5, 5)** (no payments)
- (A0, A1): (0+4, 3-4) = **(4, -1)**
- (A1, A0): (3-4, 0+4) = **(-1, 4)**
- (A1, A1): (3-4+4, 3-4+4) = **(3, 3)**

This is **identical to C1**! A0 is again dominant, yielding **(5, 5)**.

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts:
- Transform the game so A0 becomes a dominant strategy
- Guarantee the efficient outcome (5, 5)
- Increase my expected payoff from **3 to 5 points**
- Are beneficial for both players (Player 2 also improves from 3 to 5)

Since both contracts are equivalent and both strictly improve my outcome, I should approve both.

response:
To maximize my total points in this game, I need to carefully consider both the base payoff matrix and the additional payments specified in the contract.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Base Payoff Matrix:
1. **If both choose A0 (A0, A0)**:
   - Player 2: 5 points
   - Player 1: 5 points

2. **If Player 2 (me) chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1 (A0, A1)**:
   - Player 2: 0 points
   - Player 1: 3 points

3. **If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0 (A1, A0)**:
   - Player 2: 3 points
   - Player 1: 0 points

4. **If both choose A1 (A1, A1)**:
   - Player 2: 3 points
   - Player 1: 3 points

#### Additional Points from the Contract:
- **Choosing A0**: Gain an additional 4 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- **Choosing A1**: No additional payments.

With these additional payments, let's update the expected points for each case:

1. **(A0, A0)**:
   - Player 2: 5 + 4 = 9 points
   - Player 1: 5 - 4 = 1 point

2. **(A0, A1)**:
   - Player 2: 0 + 4 = 4 points
   - Player 1: 3 - 4 = -1 point

3. **(A1, A0)**:
   - Player 2: 3 - 4 = -1 point
   - Player 1: 0 + 4 = 4 points

4. **(A1, A1)**:
   - Player 2: 3 points
   - Player 1: 3 points

### Expected Payoffs
Now, we can calculate the expected payoffs for both Player 1 and Player 2 based on the updated points:

For each potential joint probability (P(A0, A0), P(A0, A1), P(A1, A0), P(A1, A1)), the expected payoff for Player 2 can be calculated.

### Optimization Strategy:
Given the updated payoff description:
- **(9, 1)**: If both choose A0
- **(4, -1)**: If I choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1
- **(-1, 4)**: If I choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0
- **(3, 3)**: If both choose A1

### Best Approach:
To maximize my total points, I should consider both safe gains and potential risks. The safest high payoff occurs when we both choose A0.

- Player 1 is incentivized to choose A0 if they predict similar incentives for me because of additional points from A0.

### Final Decision:
We should both choose A0 to maximize my expected payoff, and it’s also in Player 1’s interest. So, I will put 100% of my probability distribution on A0.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "A0": 100,
    "A1": 0
}
```

This configuration ensures the highest possible payoff for me under the given contract and basic game rules.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Calculate Modified Payoffs

First, I need to incorporate the contract into the original payoffs. The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payment

Modified payoff matrix for me (Player 1):

|          | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| I play A0 | 5 + 4 - 4 = **5** | 0 + 4 - 0 = **4** |
| I play A1 | 3 + 0 - 4 = **-1** | 3 + 0 - 0 = **3** |

## Step 2: Analyze My Best Response

Let me check which action is better for me in each scenario:

- **If the other player plays A0:** 
  - A0 gives me 5 points
  - A1 gives me -1 points
  - → A0 is better

- **If the other player plays A1:**
  - A0 gives me 4 points
  - A1 gives me 3 points
  - → A0 is better

## Step 3: Check for Dominance

Since A0 is better than A1 regardless of what the other player does, **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy** for me.

## Step 4: Verify Nash Equilibrium

The payoff structure is symmetric, so A0 is also a dominant strategy for Player 2. This means (A0, A0) is the unique Nash equilibrium, yielding 5 points for each player.

## Conclusion

Since A0 strictly dominates A1, I should play A0 with 100% probability to maximize my expected payoff.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base payoffs

The original game payoffs for me (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Apply the contract modification

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments

Since there are only 2 players, the 4 points come directly from/go to the other player.

## Step 3: Calculate modified payoffs

For each outcome:

**(A0, A0):**
- Base: 5
- I get +4 for choosing A0
- I pay -4 because other chose A0
- **Total: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5**

**(A0, A1):**
- Base: 0
- I get +4 for choosing A0
- Other chose A1, so no payment from me
- **Total: 0 + 4 = 4**

**(A1, A0):**
- Base: 3
- I chose A1, so I don't get the bonus
- I pay -4 because other chose A0
- **Total: 3 - 4 = -1**

**(A1, A1):**
- Base: 3
- No contract payments
- **Total: 3**

## Step 4: Analyze the modified game

My payoff matrix:
```
              Other A0    Other A1
My A0            5           4
My A1           -1           3
```

Comparing strategies:
- When other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → **A0 is better**
- When other plays A1: A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** in all scenarios.

## Conclusion

The optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Calculate Modified Payoffs with Contract

Let me first determine the actual payoffs including the contract effects.

**Contract terms:**
- Choosing A0 → receive +4 points from the other player
- Choosing A1 → no additional payment

**Modified payoffs for each scenario:**

**(A0, A0) - Both choose A0:**
- Base: I get 5
- I chose A0: +4 from other player
- Other chose A0: -4 to other player
- **My total: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5 points**

**(A0, A1) - I choose A0, other chooses A1:**
- Base: I get 0
- I chose A0: +4 from other player
- Other chose A1: no payment
- **My total: 0 + 4 = 4 points**

**(A1, A0) - I choose A1, other chooses A0:**
- Base: I get 3
- I chose A1: no payment
- Other chose A0: -4 to other player
- **My total: 3 - 4 = -1 points**

**(A1, A1) - Both choose A1:**
- Base: I get 3
- No contract payments
- **My total: 3 points**

### Step 2: Create My Payoff Matrix

|          | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0|       5        |       4        |
| I play A1|      -1        |       3        |

### Step 3: Determine Dominant Strategy

Comparing my payoffs:
- **When other plays A0:** A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → A0 is better
- **When other plays A1:** A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → A0 is better

**Conclusion:** A0 strictly dominates A1! No matter what the other player does, I'm always better off choosing A0.

### Step 4: Optimal Strategy

Since A0 is a strictly dominant strategy, the rational choice is to play A0 with 100% probability. This maximizes my expected payoff regardless of what the other player does.

The contract successfully incentivizes cooperation (choosing A0), which leads to a better outcome than the original game's prisoner's dilemma structure.

- (A0, A1): (0, 3) (Since P2 chooses A1, P2 gets 3 and P1 gets 0)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0) (Since P2 chooses A0, P2 gets 0 and P1 gets 3)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Step 2: Apply the contract rules:**
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they get +1 and the other player gets -1.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 (-1) and the other player gets +1.

**Total Adjusted Payoffs (P1, P2):**
1. **(A0, A0):**
   - Base: (5, 5)
   - P1 chooses A0: P1 +1, P2 -1
   - P2 chooses A0: P2 +1, P1 -1
   - Total: (5+1-1, 5+1-1) = **(5, 5)**

2. **(A0, A1):**
   - Base: (0, 3) (P1=A0, P2=A1)
   - P1 chooses A0: P1 +1, P2 -1
   - P2 chooses A1: P2 -1, P1 +1
   - Total: (0+1+1, 3-1-1) = **(2, 1)**

3. **(A1, A0):**
   - Base: (3, 0) (P1=A1, P2=A0)
   - P1 chooses A1: P1 -1, P2 +1
   - P2 chooses A0: P2 +1, P1 -1
   - Total: (3-1-1, 0+1+1) = **(1, 2)**

4. **(A1, A1):**
   - Base: (3, 3)
   - P1 chooses A1: P1 -1, P2 +1
   - P2 chooses A1: P2 -1, P1 +1
   - Total: (3-1+1, 3-1+1) = **(3, 3)**

**Step 3: Analyze the Adjusted Matrix (P1 \ P2):**
| | A0 | A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **A0** | (5, 5) | (2, 1) |
| **A1** | (1, 2) | (3, 3) |

**Step 4: Strategic Evaluation:**
This is a coordination game with two pure strategy Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).
- **Payoff Dominance:** (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant because 5 > 3 for both players.
- **Risk Dominance:** We compare the products of the losses from deviation.
   - For A0: (5-1) * (5-1) = 16
   - For A1: (3-2) * (3-2) = 1
   Since 16 > 1, **(A0, A0)** is the risk-dominant equilibrium.
- **Signaling:** Player 1 proposed this contract, which strongly suggests they intend to play the action that the contract makes most stable (A0).

Given that (A0, A0) is both the most profitable and the most stable outcome, choosing A0 is the most logical decision.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

As Player 2, the base game payoff matrix is (P1's payoff, P2's payoff):
```
         P2: A0   P2: A1
P1: A0   (5,5)    (0,3)
P1: A1   (3,0)    (3,3)
```

In the base game, there are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving (5,5) and (A1, A1) giving (3,3). The better outcome requires coordination.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1: Players choosing A0 receive +4 from the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- Both A0: (5,5) + both get +4 from each other - both pay 4 = (5,5)
- P1: A0, P2: A1: (0,3) + P1 gets +4 from P2 = (9,-4)
- P1: A1, P2: A0: (3,0) + P2 gets +4 from P1 = (-1,7)  
- Both A1: (3,3)

```
         P2: A0   P2: A1
P1: A0   (5,5)    (9,-4)
P1: A1   (-1,7)   (3,3)
```

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2: Players choosing A1 pay 4 to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- Both A0: (5,5)
- P1: A0, P2: A1: (0,3) + P2 pays 4 to P1 = (9,-4)
- P1: A1, P2: A0: (3,0) + P1 pays 4 to P2 = (-1,7)
- Both A1: (3,3) + both pay 4 to each other = (3,3)

```
         P2: A0   P2: A1
P1: A0   (5,5)    (9,-4)
P1: A1   (-1,7)   (3,3)
```

Both contracts yield identical payoff matrices!

## Step 4: Find equilibria under contracts

For Player 2 under either contract:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 5 with A0 vs -4 with A1 → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: I get 7 with A0 vs 3 with A1 → prefer A0

**A0 is a dominant strategy for me!**

For Player 1 under either contract:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 with A0 vs -1 with A1 → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 9 with A0 vs 3 with A1 → prefer A0

**A0 is also a dominant strategy for P1!**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- **Base game**: Multiple equilibria, requires coordination, risk of ending at (A1, A1) with payoff 3 for me
- **Either contract**: Unique dominant strategy equilibrium at (A0, A0) with payoff 5 for me

Both contracts make A0 a dominant strategy for both players, guaranteeing we reach the best possible outcome (5,5) without coordination risk. This is clearly beneficial for me as Player 2.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

**Without contract:**
- (Me: A0, Other: A0) → I get 5, they get 5
- (Me: A0, Other: A1) → I get 0, they get 3  
- (Me: A1, Other: A0) → I get 3, they get 0
- (Me: A1, Other: A1) → I get 3, they get 3

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs with the contract

The contract adds:
- Playing A0: no payment
- Playing A1: pay 4 points to the other player

**With contract:**
- (Me: A0, Other: A0) → I get 5, they get 5
- (Me: A0, Other: A1) → I get 0 + 4 (received from their payment) = 4, they get 3 - 4 = -1
- (Me: A1, Other: A0) → I get 3 - 4 = -1, they get 0 + 4 = 4
- (Me: A1, Other: A1) → I get 3 - 4 + 4 = 3, they get 3 - 4 + 4 = 3

## Step 3: Analyze strategic implications

**Without contract:**
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A1 (3 > 0)
- This creates strategic uncertainty and a potential mixed strategy equilibrium yielding only 3 points on average

**With contract:**
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > -1)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (4 > 3)
- **A0 becomes my dominant strategy!**

The same logic applies to Player 1 - A0 becomes their dominant strategy too.

## Step 4: Compare equilibrium outcomes

- **Without contract:** Mixed strategy equilibrium possible (expected payoff: 3), or cooperative equilibrium (5, 5) requiring coordination
- **With contract:** Unique dominant strategy equilibrium at (A0, A0) yielding (5, 5) guaranteed

## Conclusion

The contract makes mutual cooperation (A0, A0) the unique Nash equilibrium by making A1 costly. This guarantees me the maximum payoff of 5 points with no strategic risk, compared to potential outcomes as low as 3 (or even 0) without the contract.

response:

Let's closely examine each contract and determine whether approving it makes sense from the perspective of maximizing your total points.

### Base Game Analysis

First, let's understand the payoffs without any contracts:

- **Both choose A0 (0, 0)**: You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- **You choose A0 (0), the other chooses A1 (1)**: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- **You choose A1 (1), the other chooses A0 (0)**: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- **Both choose A1 (1, 1)**: You get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

### Contract 1 Analysis (Proposed by Player 1)

- If a player chooses A0, no additional payments happen.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point, distributed equally among the other player.

New payoffs under Contract 1:

- **Both choose A0 (0, 0)**: No change. You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- **You choose A0 (0), the other chooses A1 (1)**: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3+0.5 = 3.5 points.
- **You choose A1 (1), the other chooses A0 (0)**: You get 3-0.5 = 2.5 points, the other player gets 0+0.5 = 0.5 points.
- **Both choose A1 (1, 1)**: Both incur a penalty of 1 point, shared between them equally. You get 3-1+0.5 = 2.5 points, the other player gets 3-1+0.5 = 2.5 points.

### Contract 2 Analysis (Proposed by Player 2)

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other player.

New payoffs under Contract 2:

- **Both choose A0 (0, 0)**: You get 5+1 = 6 points, the other player gets 5+1 = 6 points.
- **You choose A0 (0), the other chooses A1 (1)**: You get 0+1 = 1 point, the other player gets 3-1 = 2 points.
- **You choose A1 (1), the other chooses A0 (0)**: You get 3-1 = 2 points, the other player gets 0+1 = 1 point.
- **Both choose A1 (1, 1)**: Both incur a penalty of 2 points. You get 3-2+1 = 2 points, the other player gets 3-2+1 = 2 points.

### Decision Criteria

We need to maximize our total points. Let's compare the payoffs for each contract:

- **Contract 1** (Player 1):
  - (0, 0): 5 points each
  - (0, 1): 0 vs. 3.5 
  - (1, 0): 2.5 vs. 0.5 
  - (1, 1): 2.5 points each

- **Contract 2** (Player 2):
  - (0, 0): 6 points each 
  - (0, 1): 1 vs. 2 
  - (1, 0): 2 vs. 1 
  - (1, 1): 2 points each

### Analysis Summary

- Contract 1: Mostly neutralizes A1 incentives with minor adjustments.
- Contract 2: Strongly incentivizes choosing A0 by providing additional points, thus aligning both players' actions towards (0,0) which gives a higher payoff than any other non-cooperative scenario.

Given these considerations, it makes sense to approve Contract 2 for the following reasons:
- It incentivizes both players to choose A0, resulting in higher mutual payoffs of 6 points.
- It shifts the balance towards a more cooperative scenario which results in maximized points for both players.

### Final Decision

I will approve Contract 2 and not approve Contract 1.

```json
{
    "C1": false,
    "C2": true
}
```

This decision makes the most strategic sense to maximize total points for Player 2.

response:
Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Basic Game Rules
1. Each player can choose between two actions, A0 and A1.
2. The outcomes are determined by the combination of actions chosen by both players.
3. Payoffs:
   - Both choose A0: Both get 5 points.
   - You choose A0, they choose A1: You get 0 points, they get 3 points.
   - You choose A1, they choose A0: You get 3 points, they get 0 points.
   - Both choose A1: Both get 3 points.

### Step 2: Understand the Contract
The contract adds the following penalty:
- Choosing A1 incurs a penalty of 4 points, distributed to the other player.
  - If you choose A1, you lose 4 points, and Player 2 gains 4 points.
  - If Player 2 chooses A1, they lose 4 points, and you gain 4 points.

### Step 3: Calculate the Effective Payoff with the Contract
Given the penalty, the payoffs now look like this:

- Both choose A0:
  - You: 5 (no penalty)
  - Player 2: 5 (no penalty)
- You choose A0, they choose A1:
  - You: 0 (no penalty)
  - Player 2: \(3 - 4 = -1\) (since they chose A1)
- You choose A1, they choose A0:
  - You: \(3 - 4 = -1\)
  - Player 2: 0 (no penalty)
- Both choose A1:
  - You: \(3 - 4 = -1\), plus you gain 4 from Player 2, so final: \(3 - 4 + 4 = 3\)
  - Player 2: \(3 - 4 = -1\), plus they gain 4 from you, so final: \(3 - 4 + 4 = 3\)

### Step 4: Determine the Optimal Strategy
Given the contract, the modified payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): you 5, them 5
- (A0, A1): you 0, them -1
- (A1, A0): you -1, them 0
- (A1, A1): you 3, them 3

For maximization, we look at expected payoffs:
- If both players choose A0, each gets 5, the highest among all options.
- Choosing A1 is dominated by A0 because A1 either reduces your payoff or leaves it the same as compared to A0.

It makes most sense to both agree to consistently choose A0, but since both players act simultaneously without communication, we should choose A0 100% of the time to avoid the penalties associated with A1.

To maximize the total points received as Player 2, let's analyze the original game and the proposed contracts.

### Game Analysis
The original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

There are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0), which yields 5 points each, and (A1, A1), which yields 3 points each. (A0, A0) is the payoff-dominant equilibrium.

### Contract Analysis

**Contract 1 (C1):** If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point to the other player.
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0+1, 3-1) = (1, 2)
- (A1, A0): (3-1, 0+1) = (2, 1)
- (A1, A1): (3-1+1, 3-1+1) = (3, 3)
**Result:** (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) remain equilibria. However, C1 makes A0 more stable by reducing the potential benefit of deviating to A1 (now 2 instead of 3 if the other player picks A0) and improving the payoff if you pick A0 while the other deviates (now 1 instead of 0).

**Contract 2 (C2):** If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- (A0, A0): (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0+4, 3-4) = (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (3-4, 0+4) = (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)
**Result:** Under C2, choosing A0 is a dominant strategy for both players. If Player 1 plays A0, you get 5 (A0) instead of -1 (A1). If Player 1 plays A1, you get 4 (A0) instead of 3 (A1). This guarantees the (5, 5) outcome even if players do not trust each other, as both players are incentivized to play A0 regardless of the other's choice.

### Decision Strategy
- **C1** improves the likelihood of a (5, 5) outcome compared to the original game by slightly penalizing A1.
- **C2** essentially guarantees the (5, 5) outcome by making A0 a dominant strategy with even higher potential payoffs if only one player coordinates.

Both contracts move the game toward the most favorable outcome (5 points). Approving both ensures the highest possible chance that a beneficial contract is selected, as the winning contract is chosen from those with the most approvals. Since both C1 and C2 are strictly better for gameplay stability than no contract at all, Player 2 should approve both.

{"C1": true, "C2": true}

- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Step 1: Compute how each contract changes *your* (Player 2’s) payoffs (2-player case, so “distributed equally” means all transfers go to/from the other player).

### Baseline payoffs (no contract)
- (A0,A0): 5  
- (A0,A1): 0  
- (A1,A0): 3  
- (A1,A1): 3  

---

## Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)
Rule: choosing **A1** makes you pay 1 to the other player; **A0** has no transfer.

Your payoffs become:
- (A0,A0): 5  
- (A0,A1): 0 + 1 = **1** (you receive 1 because the other played A1)
- (A1,A0): 3 − 1 = **2**
- (A1,A1): 3 (you pay 1 and receive 1)

This still leaves the same coordination problem: if you think the other plays A0, you prefer A0; if you think they play A1, you prefer A1.

---

## Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)
Rule: choosing **A0** gives you +2 taken from the other; choosing **A1** makes you pay 2 to the other.

Your payoffs become:
- (A0,A0): 5 (both get +2 and pay +2 → net 0) = **5**
- (A0,A1): 0 +2 (your A0 bonus) +2 (they pay for A1) = **4**
- (A1,A0): 3 −2 (your A1 penalty) −2 (they take 2 because they played A0) = **-1**
- (A1,A1): 3 (you pay 2 and receive 2) = **3**

Now **A0 is strictly better than A1 no matter what the other does**:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives -1
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3

So C2 forces the unique equilibrium to (A0,A0) and also greatly improves your outcome if the other might play A1.

---

Step 2: Approval decision  
Since C2 is clearly better for you strategically, and approving C1 could cause C1 to win (or increase its chances) in the approval/random tie-break process, the best choice is to **approve only C2**.

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the actual payoffs WITH the contract

The contract states that if a player chooses A1, they pay 4 points to the other player.

Let me recalculate my payoffs (as Player 2):

- **(A0, A0)**: Base: 5, No payments → **5 points**
- **(A0, A1)**: Base: 0, Other pays me 4 → **4 points**
- **(A1, A0)**: Base: 3, I pay 4 → **-1 points**
- **(A1, A1)**: Base: 3, I pay 4, Other pays me 4 → **3 points**

## Step 2: Determine my best response to each of the other player's actions

**If other player chooses A0:**
- I choose A0: I get 5
- I choose A1: I get -1
- **Best response: A0**

**If other player chooses A1:**
- I choose A0: I get 4
- I choose A1: I get 3
- **Best response: A0**

## Step 3: Conclusion

A0 is my dominant strategy - it's better regardless of what the other player does!

By symmetry, the other player faces the same payoff structure (the contract affects both players equally), so A0 is also their dominant strategy.

The contract successfully transforms this game so that mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) becomes the Nash equilibrium, giving us both 5 points instead of the 3 points we'd get if we both chose A1.

Since A0 strictly dominates A1 in all scenarios, I should choose A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Let me analyze this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the basic game without the contract

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:

|  | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **I play A0** | Me: 5, Them: 5 | Me: 0, Them: 3 |
| **I play A1** | Me: 3, Them: 0 | Me: 3, Them: 3 |

## Step 2: Identify Nash equilibria without contract

- **(A0, A0)**: Payoff (5, 5) - Neither player wants to deviate (would get 3 or 0). ✓ Nash equilibrium
- **(A1, A1)**: Payoff (3, 3) - Neither player wants to deviate (would get 0). ✓ Nash equilibrium

Without the contract, there are **two Nash equilibria**: the good one (5, 5) and the bad one (3, 3). This creates coordination risk.

## Step 3: Analyze the game with the contract

The contract imposes: If a player chooses A1, they pay 4 points to the other player.

New payoff matrix with contract:

|  | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **I play A0** | Me: 5, Them: 5 | Me: 0+4=**4**, Them: 3-4=**-1** |
| **I play A1** | Me: 3-4=**-1**, Them: 0+4=**4** | Me: 3-4+4=**3**, Them: 3-4+4=**3** |

## Step 4: Analyze strategic incentives with contract

With the contract:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (get 5) over A1 (get -1)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (get 4) over A1 (get 3)

**A0 becomes a dominant strategy for me!** The same logic applies to the other player.

## Step 5: Identify Nash equilibrium with contract

The unique Nash equilibrium is **(A0, A0)** with payoff **(5, 5)**.

The contract eliminates the bad equilibrium (3, 3) and ensures we coordinate on the efficient outcome.

## Step 6: Decision

The contract:
- Eliminates coordination risk
- Guarantees the best outcome (5 points) for both players
- Makes A0 a dominant strategy

**I should sign the contract.**

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game without contracts

The payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): 5 for me, 5 for other
- (A0, A1): 0 for me, 3 for other  
- (A1, A0): 3 for me, 0 for other
- (A1, A1): 3 for me, 3 for other

Without any contract, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) where both players get 3 points. This is because A1 gives me 3 regardless of what the other player does, while A0 only gives 5 if they cooperate but 0 if they don't.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

With Contract 1, the modified payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 4 - 4 = 5 for each (we each receive and pay 4)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 4 = 4 for me, 3 - 4 = -1 for other
- (A1, A0): 3 - 4 = -1 for me, 0 + 4 = 4 for other
- (A1, A1): 3 for each

Now A0 is dominant: it gives me at least 4 points, while A1 gives at most 3. The unique Nash equilibrium is **(A0, A0) with both getting 5 points**.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

With Contract 2, the modified payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 1 - 1 = 5 for each
- (A0, A1): 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 for me, 3 - 1 - 2 = 0 for other
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 - 1 = 0 for me, 0 + 2 + 1 = 3 for other  
- (A1, A1): 3 - 2 + 2 = 3 for each

Here, there are **two Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) giving 5 each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 each. At (A1, A1), if I switch to A0, I still get 3, so I'm indifferent. This creates coordination risk.

## Step 4: Compare contracts

- No contract: 3 points (certain)
- Contract 1: 5 points (certain - unique equilibrium)
- Contract 2: 5 points (if we coordinate well) or 3 points (coordination failure risk)

**Contract 1 is superior** because it has a unique Nash equilibrium at the Pareto-optimal outcome, eliminating coordination risk.

## Step 5: Strategic approval decision

If I approve only C1 and the other player (being rational) approves at least C1, then C1 will have at least 2 approvals and likely win. If I approve both contracts and the other player also approves both, we get a random selection with 50% chance of the riskier Contract 2.

Given that C1 strictly dominates C2 in terms of removing coordination risk, I should approve only C1.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game**

This is a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|       | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P2)** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **A1 (P2)** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

We are told that **you are Player 2** in this game.

So, from your perspective (Player 2), the payoffs are:

- If you play A0:
  - P1 plays A0 → you get 5
  - P1 plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1:
  - P1 plays A0 → you get 3
  - P1 plays A1 → you get 3

So your payoff depends on what P1 does.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Rational Behavior Without Contracts**

Let’s consider what the Nash equilibrium is here.

From **your perspective (Player 2)**:

- If you believe P1 will play A0 with probability p:
  - Expected payoff for A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
  - Expected payoff for A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3
  - You prefer A0 if 5p > 3 → p > 0.6
  - You prefer A1 if p < 0.6
  - Indifferent if p = 0.6

From **P1’s perspective**, similar logic:
- If P1 thinks you play A0 with probability q:
  - A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
  - A1: 0q + 3(1−q) = 3
  - P1 prefers A0 if q > 0.6

So the mixed-strategy equilibrium is when:
- P1 plays A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4
- You (P2) play A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4

This leads to expected payoffs:

- For you (P2):  
  = 0.6×0.6×5 + 0.6×0.4×0 + 0.4×0.6×3 + 0.4×0.4×3  
  = 0.36×5 + 0 + 0.24×3 + 0.16×3  
  = 1.8 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

Same for P1.

So **without contracts**, the expected payoff is **3 points** each.

But we now have **two proposed contracts**, and you will vote on them.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contracts**

#### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other player.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So:
- If **you (P2)** choose A0 → you get +4
- The cost is taken from the other player (P1) → P1 loses 4
- If **you** choose A1 → no additional change
- Similarly, if P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +4, you lose 4
- If P1 chooses A1 → no change

Important: “drawn equally from the other players” → since there's only one other player, it's directly taken from them.

So the *additional* payments are:

- A0 choice → gain +4 (you)
- A1 choice → 0

So the **modified payoffs** (your points) become:

| Your Action | P1's Action | Base Payoff | Additional | Total (Your) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| A0          | A0          | 5           | +4         | 9             |
| A0          | A1          | 0           | +4         | 4             |
| A1          | A0          | 3           | 0          | 3             |
| A1          | A1          | 3           | 0          | 3             |

So your payoff matrix (with C1) becomes:

|       | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P2)** | 9       | 4       |
| **A1 (P2)** | 3       | 3       |

This is highly biased toward A0 for you.

Now analyze your best response:

- If P1 plays A0 → you prefer A0 (9 > 3)
- If P1 plays A1 → you prefer A0 (4 > 3)
- So **A0 is strictly dominant for you** under C1

So in this contract, regardless of what P1 does, you will **always choose A0**.

Now what about P1?

P1’s payoffs with C1:

| P1 Action | Your Action | Base | Additional | Total (P1) |
|-----------|-------------|------|------------|-------------|
| A0        | A0          | 5    | −4         | 1           |
| A0        | A1          | 3    | −4         | −1          |
| A1        | A0          | 0    | 0          | 0           |
| A1        | A1          | 3    | 0          | 3           |

So P1’s matrix (with C1):

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)** | 1       | −1      |
| **A1 (P1)** | 0       | 3       |

So P1’s best response:
- If you (P2) play A0 → P1 prefers A0 (1 > 0)
- If you play A1 → P1 prefers A1 (3 > −1)

So:
- If you play A0 → P1 plays A0
- If you play A1 → P1 plays A1

But since **you always prefer A0**, you will play A0.

Then P1 will play A0.

Thus, outcome: **A0 vs A0** → you get 5 (base) + 4 (bonus) = **9 points**

So if C1 is implemented, you get **9 points**.

But is it stable?

Yes. You have no incentive to deviate (A0 is dominant). P1, given your A0, also plays A0.

So **C1 leads to 9 points for you**.

But wait: you are voting on it.

Do you want to approve it?

Yes — **you get 9 points under C1**, which is **much better than the 3 from the base game**.

So you should approve C1.

But let's check C2.

---

#### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2 — you)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other player.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If you choose A0 → you get +1
- If you choose A1 → you pay −2 (lose 2 points)

Same applies to P1.

So your payoff matrix with C2:

| Your Action | P1 Action | Base | Add. | Total |
|-------------|-----------|------|------|--------|
| A0          | A0        | 5    | +1   | 6      |
| A0          | A1        | 0    | +1   | 1      |
| A1          | A0        | 3    | −2   | 1      |
| A1          | A1        | 3    | −2   | 1      |

So your matrix (C2):

|       | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P2)** | 6       | 1       |
| **A1 (P2)** | 1       | 1       |

So now:
- If P1 plays A0 → you prefer A0 (6 > 1)
- If P1 plays A1 → you prefer A0 (1 vs 1) → indifferent

So **A0 is weakly dominant for you**.

You will **play A0** in equilibrium (or at least not deviate).

Now P1’s payoffs under C2:

| P1 Action | Your Action | Base | Add. | Total |
|-----------|-------------|------|------|--------|
| A0        | A0          | 5    | −1   | 4      |
| A0        | A1          | 3    | −1   | 2      |
| A1        | A0          | 0    | +2   | 2      |
| A1        | A1          | 3    | +2   | 5      |

So P1’s matrix (C2):

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)** | 4       | 2       |
| **A1 (P1)** | 2       | 5       |

So P1’s best responses:
- If you play A0 → P1 prefers A0 (4 > 2)
- If you play A1 → P1 prefers A1 (5 > 2)

But you will play A0 (as it's dominant), so P1 plays A0.

Thus, outcome: **A0 vs A0**

Your payoff: 5 (base) + 1 (bonus) = **6 points**

So under C2, you get **6 points**

Compare:
- C1: you get 9 points
- C2: you get 6 points
- Base: 3 points

So **C1 is better** for you.

But you are voting on C2 — it's your **own proposal**.

Do you approve it?

Yes — **you get 6 points under C2**, which is better than the base 3.

So even though it's worse than C1, it’s still **better than no contract**.

So **you should approve C2** as well?

Wait — but approval is **only about whether you want it to be passed**, based on your payoff.

If C2 passes, you get 6 points — better than base.

So yes — you would approve it.

But what if **both pass**?

The winning contract is selected **uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if **both** contracts are approved, they tie in approvals → one is chosen at random.

But you **don’t know** which will be selected.

So you must evaluate **your expected payoff** under the approval decisions.

Let’s formalize this.

---

### **Step 4: Game-Theoretic Voting Strategy**

You are deciding whether to approve C1 and/or C2.

Your goal: **maximize your expected payoff**.

Outcomes depend on which contracts pass.

But **you control your own approvals**, and the **winning contract is chosen uniformly at random among those with the maximum approvals**.

So possible approval combinations:

- Approve C1 only → C1 passes (1 approval), C2 fails
- Approve C2 only → C2 passes
- Approve both → both get 1 approval → max approvals = 1 → so **one is chosen uniformly at random** → you get 50% chance to get C1 (9 points), 50% chance to get C2 (6 points) → expected = (9 + 6)/2 = **7.5**
- Approve neither → no contract passes → base game → you get 3 points

So let’s compute your **expected payoff** under each approval choice:

#### **Option 1: Approve only C1**
- C1 passes → you get 9 points
- C2 fails → not relevant
- Expected payoff: **9**

#### **Option 2: Approve only C2**
- C2 passes → you get 6 points
- C1 fails
- Expected payoff: **6**

#### **Option 3: Approve both C1 and C2**
- Both get 1 approval → max approvals = 1 → winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% C1 (9), 50% C2 (6)
- Expected payoff: 0.5×9 + 0.5×6 = **7.5**

#### **Option 4: Approve neither**
- No contract → base game → you get 3 points

So ranking:
- Approve C1 only: 9
- Approve both: 7.5
- Approve C2 only: 6
- Approve neither: 3

**Best: Approve only C1 → expected 9**

But wait — if you approve **only C1**, then only C1 passes — you get 9.

If you approve **both**, you get **7.5 on average** — worse.

So you should **choose to approve only C1**, not C2.

But is that rational?

Yes — because C1 gives you **higher payoff than C2**, and **you don’t need to approve both** to get a good outcome.

But here’s the key: **you may not want to approve C2** if it reduces your expected payoff.

In fact, approving C2 even when C1 already passes **can hurt you**, because it opens the door to a **worse contract** being chosen with 50% chance.

So **you should not approve C2 if C1 is already approved**.

But **approval is based on your belief about the contract’s net effect**, **including the risk of randomness**.

You want to **maximize your expected payoff** under the approval rule.

So:

- Approve C1 only → payoff: 9
- Approve C2 only → 6
- Approve both → 7.5
- Approve neither → 3

Clearly, **approving only C1 gives the highest expected payoff (9)**.

But is there a reason to approve C2?

Only if it somehow improves your outcome.

But **approving C2 when C1 is already approved** makes it **less likely that C1 will be selected**, because now there is a tie — and it's selected at random.

So even though C2 is better than base, it's **worse than C1**.

So approving C2 when you have C1 is **risky and suboptimal** — you reduce your expected payoff from 9 to 7.5.

Hence, **you should not approve C2**.

But what if **C1 fails**?

But **you control your approval**, so you can choose to approve C1.

And since you want to **maximize expected payoff**, you **should approve C1**, and **not approve C2**.

Thus, your optimal strategy is to **approve C1 only**.

But is C1 even good for P1?

That doesn’t matter — you are only concerned with **your payoff**.

C1 is great for you — you get 9.

It’s risky for P1 — P1 gets only 1 when A0 vs A0.

But P1 might **not approve it**, and that’s fine.

You control your **approval**, not P1’s.

But the contract only passes **if enough players approve it**.

Wait — the contract is selected via **approval voting**, but we are not told how many approvals are needed for a contract to pass.

But the key sentence is:

> "The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

This implies that a contract **only needs some approvals** to be eligible — and the one with highest approvals wins — if tied, random.

But **how many approvals are needed for a contract to qualify**?

It's not specified, but the phrasing suggests that **any contract with at least one approval is eligible**, and then the one with **maximum approvals** wins.

But actually, it says: "from those with the maximum number of approvals" — so even if only one approval, if others get 0, then you win.

So for a contract to pass, it just needs **at least one approval**, and if it has the maximum number of approvals (i.e., more than or equal to others), and tied, random.

But in this case, you are **only player voting**? Or is P1 also voting?

Wait — the instruction says:

> "your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of."

So **you** are the one deciding.

And the contract is selected from those with maximum approvals.

But **who else is voting?**

The contracts are proposed by **Player 1** and **Player 2 (you)**.

So only two players: P1 and P2 (you).

So **both of you vote**.

But the problem only asks **you** to output your approval.

So you are to **simulate your decision**, but it's not just your choice — the outcome depends on what **P1** does.

But the problem **does not specify** P1’s preferences or behavior.

So we must assume that your decision is **independent**, and you are to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming P1’s approval decisions are **fixed or unknown**.

But the problem gives no guidance on P1’s preferences.

Therefore, **we must assume that P1’s voting behavior is fixed or given**, but it's not.

Wait — actually, the **only contracts proposed are C1 and C2** — so only two contracts.

C1: by P1

C2: by you

Now, **approval voting**: each player votes to approve or disapprove each contract?

But the instruction says:

> "your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of."

So **you** vote on **both** contracts.

Similarly, P1 votes on both.

But we don’t know P1’s votes.

But the **winning contract** is selected from those with **maximum number of approvals**.

So the outcome depends on **both players' votes**.

But since we don’t know P1’s behavior, we must **assume that P1's votes are unknown**, and we need to evaluate **our own approval** under **rational expectations**.

But — crucially — **you are trying to maximize your expected payoff**.

So what should you do?

You need to **choose your approvals** to **maximize your expected payoff**, **assuming P1 will vote rationally** (likely in their own interest).

But we don’t know how P1 will vote — but we can infer.

Let’s analyze P1’s preferences.

---

#### **P1’s Incentives**

##### **If C1 is implemented** (approved by you and P1)

- C1: A0 → +4, drawn from other player
- So if P1 plays A0 → gains +4
- But if P2 (you) plays A0 → P1 loses 4
- As we saw earlier: under C1, P1 gets:
  - A0 vs A0: 1 point
  - A0 vs A1: −1
  - A1 vs A0: 0
  - A1 vs A1: 3

So P1’s best outcome is A1 vs A1 → 3 points

But if you (P2) play A0 (which you will), P1 is forced to play A0 → gets only 1

So P1’s payoff under C1: **1 point**

Compare to base game: 3 points

So P1 **gets less** under C1 → **P1 will not approve C1**

Because their payoff drops from 3 to 1.

So **P1 will disapprove C1**

##### **If C2 is implemented**

C2: A0 → +1 (for player), A1 → −2 (paid)

P1’s payoffs under C2:

From earlier: 
- A0 vs A0: 4
- A0 vs A1: 2
- A1 vs A0: 2
- A1 vs A1: 5

P1’s **best** is A1 vs A1 → gets 5

In equilibrium: you play A0 (dominant), P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 4

Compare to base: 3 → **better than base**

So P1 gets 4 under C2 vs 3 base → **P1 prefers C2 over base** → so **P1 will approve C2**

Now, what about C1?

P1 gets only 1 under C1 → worse than base (3) → so **P1 disapproves C1**

So **P1's votes**:
- C1: no (disapprove)
- C2: yes (approve)

Now, you (P2) vote.

What do you do?

Let’s consider possible outcomes.

Suppose you approve C1 and C2.

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (you) → P1 disapproves → so C1: 1 approval
- C2: 2 approvals (you + P1) → so C2 has more approvals than C1

So winning contract → C2 (2 approvals)

You get **6 points** under C2

Suppose you approve C1 only.

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (you), P1: 0 → total 1
- C2: 0 (you), P1: 1 → C2: 1 approval

So both have 1 approval → max = 1 → winner chosen **uniformly at random**

So C1: 50% chance → you get 9
C2: 50% chance → you get 6

Expected payoff: 0.5×9 + 0.5×6 = **7.5**

Suppose you approve C2 only.

Then:
- C1: 0
- C2: 1 (you) + 1 (P1) = 2 → so C2 wins → you get 6

Suppose you approve neither.

Then:
- C1: 0
- C2: 1 → C2 wins → you get 6

But wait — C2 has 1 approval (P1), C1 has 0 → so C2 wins → you get 6

So summary:

| Your Approval | C1 | C2 | Winning Contract | Your Payoff |
|---------------|----|----|------------------|-------------|
| C1 only       | Y  | N  | random (C1 or C2) → 50% each | 7.5 |
| C2 only       | N  | Y  | C2 (2>0) | 6 |
| Both          | Y  | Y  | C2 (2>1) | 6 |
| Neither       | N  | N  | C2 (1>0) | 6 |

So your outcomes:

- Approve only C1: **7.5**
- Approve C2 only: 6
- Approve both: 6
- Approve neither: 6

So **best is to approve C1 only** → expected payoff 7.5

Even though C1 has no chance of passing (P1 disapproves), its **approval** gives you a **chance to beat C2** in the tie-breaking.

Because if you approve C1 and not C2, you get a 50% chance at 9 and 50% at 6 → average 7.5

But if you approve C2 (even only), you **guarantee** C2 wins, and you get only 6.

So you should **approve C1 only**, to create a tie that gives you a **50% shot at 9**.

You should **not approve C2**, because it leads to a **worse outcome**.

Even though C2 is good for P1, and even though C2 is good for you (6 > 3), **you can do better by not approving it**.

So your **optimal strategy is to approve C1 only**.

---

### **Final Decision**

You:
- Approve C1 → **true**
- Approve C2 → **false**

This gives you **7.5 expected payoff**, the highest possible.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 4 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (without contract)

My payoff matrix:
```
           Opp A0    Opp A1
My A0        5         0
My A1        3         3
```

## Step 2: Analyze the contract terms

If a player chooses A1, they pay 4 points to the other player.

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

My effective payoffs become:
```
           Opp A0         Opp A1
My A0    5 (no change)   0 + 4 = 4 (I receive opponent's payment)
My A1    3 - 4 = -1      3 - 4 + 4 = 3 (I pay, opponent pays)
         (I pay)
```

## Step 4: Compare strategic situations

**Without contract:**
- (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium → I get 5 points
- (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium → I get 3 points
- There's coordination risk - we might end up in the worse equilibrium

**With contract:**
- If opponent plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → A0 is strictly better
- If opponent plays A1: A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → A0 is strictly better

**A0 becomes a dominant strategy for me (and the opponent too)!**

## Step 5: Expected outcomes

- **With contract:** A0 dominates A1, so the unique equilibrium is (A0, A0) giving me **5 points**
- **Without contract:** Multiple equilibria exist, with risk of coordination failure

## Step 6: Decision

The contract:
1. Eliminates the inferior equilibrium (A1, A1)
2. Makes the optimal strategy obvious (A0 dominates)
3. Removes coordination risk
4. Improves my worst-case payoff when playing A0 (from 0 to 4)

The contract guarantees I'll rationally play A0 and get at least 4 points, with the best outcome being 5 points.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

We are Player 2. The payoff matrix (from Player 2's perspective) is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0      | A1      |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| **A0**               | 5       | 0       |
| **A1**               | 3       | 3       |

This is a classic coordination and conflict game. Let's analyze it.

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - Player 2 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A0.
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - Player 2 gets 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A1.

So there is no dominant strategy for Player 2 — it depends on Player 1’s action.

Now let’s look at Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): Both get 5. Is it stable?
  - If Player 2 deviates to A1: gets 3 < 5 → no incentive.
  - If Player 1 deviates to A1: gets 3 < 5 → no incentive.
  → So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

- (A1, A1): Both get 3.
  - If Player 2 deviates to A0: gets 0 < 3 → no.
  - If Player 1 deviates to A0: gets 0 < 3 → no.
  → (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

- (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 0, Player 1 gets 3.
  - Player 2 would want to switch to A1 to get 3 > 0.
  → Not a Nash equilibrium.

- (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 3, Player 1 gets 0.
  - Player 1 would want to switch to A1 to get 3 > 0.
  → Not a Nash equilibrium.

So there are **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

Mixed strategy may also exist, but we’ll revisit that later.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Important details:

- The contract is **only active if all players sign it**.
- You are deciding whether to sign it.
- The contract affects **both the player who acts** and **the other player(s)**.

Let’s examine how the contract alters the payoffs.

Since there are only two players, and the payment is "drawn equally from the other players":

- If **you** choose A0: you get +1, and the other player loses 1 (since payment is drawn from them).
- If **you** choose A1: you pay 1 (i.e., get -1), and the other player gains 1.

**So the contract alters the payoffs based on your action.**

Let’s write the **new payoff matrix with contract**, assuming the contract is signed (and thus active).

#### **Payoff Matrix with Contract (from Player 2's perspective):**

Let’s define the total payoff as original payoff + contract-adjusted payment.

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1 gets extra, P2 loses 1 if P2 plays A0) | A1 (P1 pays 1 if plays A1, so P2 gains 1) |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **A0** | Original: 5 + (if I play A0, I get +1) = 6, but P1 loses 1 → P1 pays 1 if they play A0? Wait — no: the contract is **when you play**, not when the other plays.

Let’s re-analyze carefully.

> The contract: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So **the payment is triggered by the choice of the player**, not based on the other's choice.

So:
- If **I choose A0**, I get +1, and the other player loses 1.
- If **I choose A1**, I pay -1, and the other player gains +1.

**Importantly, this adjustment is applied regardless of the outcome.**

So for a given outcome, we add the contract-adjusted payments.

Let’s compute new payoffs.

Let’s compute for each cell:

---

#### (A0, A0): both play A0
- Original payoff for P2: 5
- P2 played A0 → gets +1 from contract
- P1 played A0 → P1 gets +1, so P2 loses 1 (because P2 is the other player)
- So P2’s **total** = 5 + 1 (from own A0) - 1 (because P1 got +1) = **5**
- Wait — is the contract only about what **you** do, and the cost/benefit is distributed to others?

Yes: "drawn equally from the other players" — so **if you choose A0, you get +1, and each other player loses 1.**

Since only one other player, that player loses 1.

Similarly, if you choose A1, you lose 1, and each other player gains 1.

So:
- If **P2 plays A0**: P2 gets +1; P1 loses 1
- If **P2 plays A1**: P2 gets -1; P1 gains 1
- Same if P1 does it: if P1 plays A0, P2 loses 1; if P1 plays A1, P2 gains 1

So the contract affects both players’ payoffs based on **their own actions**, independently.

So let’s compute the total payoff.

---

### New Payoffs with Contract (both players signed):

#### Case: P2 = A0, P1 = A0
- Original: P2 gets 5
- P2 played A0 → +1
- P1 played A0 → P2 loses 1 (because P2 is "other player" to P1)
- So P2 total: 5 + 1 - 1 = **5**

#### Case: P2 = A0, P1 = A1
- Original: P2 gets 0
- P2 played A0 → +1
- P1 played A1 → P2 gains 1 (since P1 pays 1, P2 gets it)
- So P2 total: 0 + 1 + 1 = **2**

#### Case: P2 = A1, P1 = A0
- Original: P2 gets 3
- P2 played A1 → -1
- P1 played A0 → P2 loses 1
- So P2 total: 3 - 1 - 1 = **1**

#### Case: P2 = A1, P1 = A1
- Original: P2 gets 3
- P2 played A1 → -1
- P1 played A1 → P2 gains 1
- So P2 total: 3 - 1 + 1 = **3**

So the **new payoff matrix (Player 2)** is:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | 5  | 2  |
| **A1** | 1  | 3  |

Wait: from P2’s view:

- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A0): 1
- (A1, A1): 3

Now, what are the incentives?

Let’s analyze best responses.

For P2:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 5 for A0, 1 for A1 → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 2 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A1

So again, no dominant strategy.

But now let’s look for **Nash equilibria**.

- (A0, A0): P2 would not deviate (5 > 1), P1’s payoff (same logic) — let’s compute P1’s payoffs to check.

P1’s payoffs with contract:

#### (A0, A0):
- Original: 5
- P1 played A0 → +1
- P2 played A0 → so P1 loses 1
- Total: 5 + 1 - 1 = 5

#### (A0, A1):
- Original: 3
- P1 played A0 → +1
- P2 played A1 → P1 gains 1 (P2 pays 1)
- Total: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5

#### (A1, A0):
- Original: 0
- P1 played A1 → -1
- P2 played A0 → P1 loses 1
- Total: 0 -1 -1 = -2

#### (A1, A1):
- Original: 3
- P1 played A1 → -1
- P2 played A1 → P1 gains 1
- Total: 3 -1 +1 = 3

So P1’s matrix:
| P1 \ P2 | A0   | A1   |
|---------|------|------|
| **A0**  | 5    | 5    |
| **A1**  | -2   | 3    |

Now, check for Nash equilibria.

1. (A0, A0):
   - P2: 5 vs 1 → won't deviate
   - P1: 5 vs -2 → won't deviate
   → **Nash equilibrium**

2. (A0, A1):
   - P2: 2 vs 3 → wants to deviate to A1
   → Not equilibrium

3. (A1, A0):
   - P1: -2 vs 5 → wants to deviate to A0
   → Not equilibrium

4. (A1, A1):
   - P2: 3 vs 2 → won’t deviate
   - P1: 3 vs 5 → wants to deviate to A0
   → Not equilibrium

So only **(A0, A0)** is a Nash equilibrium under the contract.

But wait — is it really stable?

- In (A0, A0), both get 5 from original, plus from contract:
  - Each gets +1 (for their A0) and loses 1 (because other played A0)
  → So net 5 + 1 - 1 = 5, yes.

But now, suppose both expected to play A0 — but is there an incentive to deviate?

No — both prefer to stick.

But here's a problem: what if **you expect the other player to play A0**, then you also want to play A0 (gives 5) — better than playing A1 (1). So that's good.

But what if the contract changes the incentives too much?

Wait — from P2’s perspective, the new payoffs are:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | 5  | 2  |
| **A1** | 1  | 3  |

So P2's best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → best is A0 (5 > 1)
- If P1 plays A1 → best is A1 (3 > 2)

So best response function:
- P2 A0 iff P1 A0
- P2 A1 iff P1 A1

So the only equilibrium is when both choose same action.

But (A1, A1): P1 would not play A1 (because if P2 plays A0, P1 gets -2; if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 — so P1 would only play A1 if P2 plays A1). But in (A1, A1), P1 gets 3, and if deviates to A0, gets 5? Wait no:

P1’s payoff in (A1, A1): 3
In (A0, A1): 5 → so **P1 would deviate** from A1 to A0 if P2 plays A1.

So P1's best response to A1 is actually A0 (gets 5 > 3)!! So (A1, A1) can't be equilibrium.

Earlier I thought P1 gets 3 in (A1, A1) and 5 in (A0, A1) → so P1 prefers A0 if P2 plays A1.

So P1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 5 for A0, -2 for A1 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A0

So **P1’s dominant strategy is A0**!

P1’s best response is always A0.

Therefore, P1 will play A0 regardless.

Then P2’s best response: if P1 plays A0 → P2 prefers A0 (5 vs 1)

So the **only Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**.

And it’s stable.

But — crucially — **if the contract is signed, and both players are rational, they will play (A0, A0)**.

Now, what if you don’t sign the contract?

Then **no contract effect** — we go back to the base game.

In the base game, there are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

So if you don’t sign, you’re uncertain — could end up at (A0, A0) or (A1, A1), depending on coordination.

But if you **do sign**, the contract makes (A0, A0) the **only** Nash equilibrium, **and P1 has a dominant strategy to play A0**.

So signing the contract **forces coordination on A0**, and prevents the (A1, A1) equilibrium.

Now, which is better for you?

- In (A0, A0): you get 5 points (base) +1 (from your A0) -1 (from P1’s A0) = **5**
- In (A1, A1): you get 3 points (base)

So **in the signed contract scenario**, you *only* get 5 if the game goes to (A0, A0), which is the only equilibrium — so you get 5.

But **what if you don’t sign**?

Then you’re in the base game. There are two equilibria.

But which one will occur?

Without coordination, players might not coordinate on (A0, A0), especially since (A1, A1) is also stable.

If you assume players will coordinate on a focal point — (A0, A0) is better for both, so plausible.

But if the other player is not thinking strategically, or is risk-averse, maybe they go for A1.

But from the perspective of maximizing your expected payoff, **if you sign**, you **guarantee** the game goes to (A0, A0) (because P1 has dominant strategy A0, and you best respond with A0) → you get 5.

If you **don’t sign**, then you face uncertainty.

- If both play (A0, A0): you get 5
- If both play (A1, A1): you get 3
- If they miscoordinate: you get 0 or 3, but in equilibrium, we assume they play equilibrium.

But since there are **two equilibria**, and no coordination mechanism, your expected payoff depends on the probability of coordination.

If you believe coordination on (A0, A0) is likely, you might prefer not to sign.

But here's the key twist: **the contract only becomes active if both sign.**

So **if you don’t sign**, the contract doesn’t activate — and you are back to base game.

But **if you sign**, **only if the other signs too**, does the contract activate.

But **the other player is not forced to sign** — but in this scenario, the contract was "selected via approval voting" — it seems the other player may have voted yes.

Wait — the contract was proposed by Player 1, and selected via approval voting.

So it’s implied that **Player 1 signed** the contract.

But **you** are deciding whether to sign.

So:
- If you **sign**, then **both signed** → contract active → payoff matrix changes, and (A0, A0) is the unique equilibrium.
- If you **don’t sign**, contract not active → back to base game.

So your decision is: **sign or not**.

If you sign → contract active → you play a game where only (A0, A0) is equilibrium → you get 5.

If you don’t sign → contract inactive → base game → now, if the other player is rational, they might play A0 or A1.

But in the base game, (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are both equilibria.

But the other player (Player 1) — they are the one who proposed the contract.

Why did they propose it?

**They are rational. They saw that if the contract is active, they have a dominant strategy to play A0.**

And they get 5 in (A0, A0), and 3 in (A1, A1). So they prefer (A0, A0).

So if they **proposed** the contract, it suggests they want to coordinate on (A0, A0).

So likely, Player 1 expects to play A0.

But if you don’t sign the contract, then Player 1 still knows that in the base game, (A0, A0) is an equilibrium.

So Player 1 might still play A0.

But you don’t know what they will do.

Let’s suppose you **don’t sign**.

Then the game reverts to base game.

Player 1 can play:
- A0: if you play A0 → gets 5; if you play A1 → gets 0
- A1: if you play A0 → gets 3; if you play A1 → gets 3

So Player 1’s best response:
- If you play A0 → P1 prefers A0 (5 > 3)
- If you play A1 → P1 is indifferent (0 vs 3? Wait no)

Wait:
- If you play A1:
  - P1 plays A0 → gets 3 (from (A1, A0): P1 gets 3)
  - P1 plays A1 → gets 3
  → so indifferent.

So P1’s best response:
- A0 if you play A0
- Any (since indifferent) if you play A1

So if you play A1, P1 might play A1.

So if you play A1, P1 might play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 3

If you play A0, P1 plays A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 5

So **your best response in the base game** is A0, **if you believe P1 is rational**.

So if you believe Player 1 will play A0, you play A0 → get 5.

But if you don’t sign, and you play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 5.

But if you play A1, P1 might play A1 → you get 3.

So better to play A0.

Thus, in the base game, **if both are rational and believe the other is rational**, they might still coordinate on A0.

So in both cases — signing or not — you might get 5.

**But is that true?**

Wait — in the **signed case**, the contract **forces** the equilibrium to be (A0, A0).

In the **unsigned case**, you can still coordinate on A0, but there’s a risk of coordination failure — unless you can be sure the other player will play A0.

But in this setup, Player 1 proposed the contract — which is only beneficial to them if the game goes to A0.

In fact, if the contract is signed, Player 1 gets:
- In (A0, A0): 5 (original) +1 (their A0) -1 (your A0) = 5
- In (A1, A1): 3 (original) -1 (their A1) +1 (your A1) = 3
- So they prefer A0.

But if they are rational, and they **propose** the contract, they **want to make sure that A0 is played**.

So they **want you to sign**, so that the contract is active.

Now, back to your decision: should you sign?

If you sign, you get 5 (in (A0, A0)) — guaranteed.

If you **don’t sign**, then:
- The contract is inactive.
- You are back to base game.
- But Player 1 still wants you to play A0.
- But if you don't sign, you have **no incentive to play A0** in the contract sense? No — in base game, you still get 5 for playing A0 if they play A0, or 3 for A1 if they play A1.

But is there any reason to believe that not signing helps you?

Wait — **no**: in the **signed** case, you get 5 (and the game goes to (A0, A0)).

In the **unsigned** case, the game is base game, and **if both players are rational and coordination is achieved**, you get 5.

So same outcome.

But what if coordination fails?

In the **signed** case: **only (A0, A0) is equilibrium**, so no coordination failure — you **must** end up with (A0, A0) if both play rationally.

In the **unsigned** case: there are two equilibria — so if coordination fails and you play A1 while they play A0, you get 0 — **which is worse**.

So by **not signing**, you risk going to (A1, A1) or miscoordination.

But if you sign, you **guarantee** (A0, A0) and get 5.

Without signing, you risk:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A1, A1): 3
- Miscoordination: 0 or 3

So expected payoff might be lower.

But do you get more by signing?

Let’s compare:

- **If you sign**: you get exactly **5** (since (A0, A0) is the only equilibrium, and both play optimally).
- **If you don’t sign**: in base game, worst-case you get 3, best 5, but with risk of getting 0.

But if you believe that the other player will play A0 (because of the contract they proposed), then you get 5.

But if you don’t sign, and you play A0, they play A0 → you get 5.

But if you play A1, they might play A1 → you get 3.

So you should play A0.

Thus, with rational players, you would still get 5.

So same as signing?

But here’s the **crucial point**:

In the **signed case**, **you are committed to the contract**, and the game dynamics are altered.

But in the **unsigned case**, **you have no contract**, so your payoff is just base: 5 in (A0, A0).

But **if you sign**, you have the **same outcome** — 5.

But is there any reason to **not** sign?

What if you think that **not signing** lets you avoid being locked into the contract, but actually, **not signing avoids a risk?**

No — the contract only harms you if you play A1, but under the contract, you **don’t** want to play A1.

Wait — in the signed game, your payoff for playing A1 when they play A0 is **1** (was 3 originally), which is worse.

But since you won’t play A1 anyway — because you get 5 for A0 vs 1 for A1 — you’re still going to play A0.

So signing **only changes the payoffs** but **doesn't force you** to deviate — in fact, it strengthens your incentive to play A0.

But here’s a deeper point: **if you sign**, then even if you wanted to play A1, you couldn’t — no, you can still choose A1, but you wouldn’t because it’s worse.

So signing doesn’t hurt.

But **not signing** leaves you vulnerable to the risk of (A1, A1) or miscoordination, especially if the other player is uncertain.

But **in this case**, Player 1 proposed the contract — they **want to coordinate on A0**.

So if you don’t sign, the contract is inactive, and Player 1 might still play A0, but they no longer have the contract incentive.

But since (A0, A0) is still a Nash equilibrium, they might still play it.

But if you don’t sign, then Player 1 **doesn’t get the +1** if they play A0, because the contract isn’t active — so they only get 5 from original.

Same as you.

But in the contract case, they get 5 anyway.

So no harm.

But the key is: **by signing, you make the equilibrium unique and stable — (A0, A0).**

By not signing, you have **two possible equilibria** — (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

If you don’t sign, and Player 1 is not sure you will play A0, they might play A1 to guarantee 3.

Then if you play A1, you get 3.

But if you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0.

So you might avoid playing A0.

So coordination on (A0, A0) **fails**.

Thus, **not signing increases the risk of ending up in a worse equilibrium**.

Whereas **signing the contract resolves the coordination problem** and ensures (A0, A0).

Therefore, **signing the contract increases your safety and ensures the highest possible payoff (5)**.

Even though in both cases you get 5 if coordinated, the **signed contract makes coordination inevitable**, while **not signing leaves it uncertain**.

Thus, **signing the contract is better for you**.

Moreover, in the signed case, you **get 5**, and there is no risk.

In the unsigned case, you might get 3 or even 0.

So **your minimum guaranteed payoff is higher under the contract?** Not exactly, because in the base game, you could still get 5.

But **your expected payoff is higher under the contract**, because the contract eliminates the risk of miscoordination.

Even if coordination is perfect, you get 5.

But if coordination fails, you get less.

So the **expected payoff is higher** under the contract, because it removes ambiguity.

Thus, **you should sign**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P1
response:
To approach this game, we need to think strategically about both the payoffs from the actions and the contract's additional payments.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Payoff Dynamics Without Contract**:
    - If both players choose A0, each gets 5.
    - If Player 1 (P1) chooses A0 and Player 2 (P2) chooses A1, P1 gets 0, and P2 gets 3.
    - If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0, P1 gets 3 and P2 gets 0.
    - If both players choose A1, each gets 3.

2. **Contract's Impact**:
    - A0 choice gives an extra +1 point due to the contract.
    - A1 choice results in -1 point due to the contract.

3. **Net Payoffs Taking the Contract into Account**:
    - If both choose A0: each gets \(5 + 1 = 6\) points.
    - If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: P1 gets \(0 + 1 = 1\), and P2 gets \(3 - 1 = 2\).
    - If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: P1 gets \(3 - 1 = 2\), and P2 gets \(0 + 1 = 1\).
    - If both choose A1: each gets \(3 - 1 = 2\) points.

Based on the new payoffs:
- Choosing A0 appears advantageous if both choose A0 (both get 6 points).
- Mixed strategies show no particular advantage over mutual cooperation (both choose A0).

### Logical Conclusion:
The new payoffs suggest that both players benefit maximally by choosing A0. Given rational behavior aimed to maximize points and considering mutual benefits and penalties in mixed strategies, both players should favor A0 overwhelmingly.

### Proposed Strategy:
Given the dominant strategy of mutual cooperation, P1 should choose A0 with a high probability. A probability of 100% for A0 seems reasonable since deviations would not yield better outcomes considering rational behavior.

### Final Answer:
Given the analysis, the JSON object reflecting the optimal strategy is:

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 4 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoffs with the contract

The contract adds a penalty: if someone chooses A1, they pay 4 points to the other player.

**My payoffs (Player 2) WITH contract:**

| My Action | Other's Action | Base Payoff | I Pay | I Receive | **Total** |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A0 | A0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | **5** |
| A0 | A1 | 0 | 0 | 4 | **4** |
| A1 | A0 | 3 | 4 | 0 | **-1** |
| A1 | A1 | 3 | 4 | 4 | **3** |

## Step 2: Determine my best response

Let me compare A0 vs A1 for each possible action by the other player:

**If other player chooses A0:**
- A0 gives me: 5 points
- A1 gives me: -1 points
- **A0 is better**

**If other player chooses A1:**
- A0 gives me: 4 points  
- A1 gives me: 3 points
- **A0 is better**

## Step 3: Identify the dominant strategy

A0 gives me strictly higher payoffs than A1 regardless of what the other player does. This means **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy** for me.

## Step 4: Verify this makes sense

The contract was designed to penalize A1 with a 4-point payment. This penalty is severe enough to make A1 worse than A0 in all scenarios. The contract effectively enforces cooperation (both players choosing A0) by making defection costly.

## Conclusion

Since A0 strictly dominates A1, I should play A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Calculate Modified Payoffs

First, I need to account for the contract's payment structure.

**Contract effect:**
- Choosing A0: No additional payment
- Choosing A1: Pay 4 points (distributed to the other player)

**My payoffs with contract:**
- (A0, A0): 5 + 0 = **5 points**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 4 (receive payment from other) = **4 points**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 4 (I pay penalty) = **-1 points**
- (A1, A1): 3 - 4 (I pay) + 4 (I receive from other) = **3 points**

## Step 2: Check for Dominant Strategy

Let me compare A0 vs A1 for each possible action by the other player:

**If other player chooses A0:**
- My A0: 5 points
- My A1: -1 points
- **A0 is better** (5 > -1)

**If other player chooses A1:**
- My A0: 4 points
- My A1: 3 points
- **A0 is better** (4 > 3)

## Step 3: Conclusion

A0 **strictly dominates** A1 in all scenarios. Regardless of what the other player does, I'm always better off choosing A0.

Additionally, by symmetry, the other player faces the same payoff structure and will also prefer A0.

The contract has successfully transformed this game so that mutual cooperation (A0, A0) yielding 5 points each is the dominant strategy equilibrium.

**Optimal Strategy:** Play A0 with 100% probability.

On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game without contract

The payoff matrix from my perspective is:
- (A0, A0): I get 5, opponent gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, opponent gets 3

Without the contract:
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A1 (3 > 0)

This creates coordination problems. There are two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5 each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 each. There's also a mixed strategy equilibrium at approximately (0.6, 0.6) for A0, yielding expected payoff of 3.

## Step 2: Analyze payoffs with the contract

With the contract, when a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player.

New payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**, opponent gets 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 4 = **4**, opponent gets 3 - 4 = -1
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 4 = **-1**, opponent gets 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1, A1): I get **3**, opponent gets 3

## Step 3: Determine optimal strategy with contract

With contract payoffs:
- If opponent plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If opponent plays A1: I get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 becomes a dominant strategy!** The same logic applies to the opponent.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: Risk of (A1, A1) equilibrium (3 points) or mixed strategy (3 points expected)
- **With contract**: Guaranteed (A0, A0) equilibrium (5 points)

The contract ensures we coordinate on the best outcome (5 points each) by making A0 dominant. This eliminates the bad equilibrium and coordination risk.

**Conclusion**: Signing the contract guarantees the optimal outcome.

response:
Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step, including the base payoff structure, the role of contracts, the approval mechanism, and how to determine which contracts are favorable to **you**, as **Player 1**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game**

The base game is a coordination game with asymmetric payoffs:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Payoff | Other Player's Payoff |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5           | 5                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 3           | 3                      |

This is **not symmetric** in payoffs. Let’s identify the Nash equilibria.

#### Best Responses:

- **If other player plays A0:**
  - You get 5 (if A0) vs 3 (if A1) → prefer A0
- **If other player plays A1:**
  - You get 0 (if A0) vs 3 (if A1) → prefer A1

So:
- (A0, A0) → mutual best response → **Nash equilibrium**
- (A1, A1) → mutual best response → **Nash equilibrium**

(A0, A1) and (A1, A0) are **not** equilibria because one player wants to deviate.

Thus, the game has **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Now, which one is better?

- (A0, A0): you get 5
- (A1, A1): you get 3

So (A0, A0) is **Pareto superior** and better for you.

But since both equilibria exist, coordination is a problem. The challenge is to coordinate on (A0, A0) rather than (A1, A1).

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

Contracts modify payoffs by adding **side payments** based on actions.

#### Key rule:
- Contracts are only effective **if both players approve**.
- The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- But you are deciding **which contracts you approve**, and your goal is to **maximize your expected points**, assuming the other player is also rational and will approve contracts they prefer.

So your **decision** is strategic: you must approve contracts that either:
- Maximize your expected payoff **given the final selected contract**, and
- Are likely to be approved by the other player (if they are rational), so you can have more contracts approved.

But since only the **maximum approval** set wins (randomly selected), and tie-breaking is random among high-approval contracts, you should aim to **approve contracts that are in your interest**, and **that are likely to be acceptable to Player 2**, especially if you believe Player 2 will act rationally.

But we have to **evaluate each contract** from **your perspective (Player 1)**: what does it do to your payoffs, and how does it affect behavior?

Let’s define the two contracts.

---

### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payment.
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since there are **two players**, "distributed equally among the other players" means:
- If one player chooses A1 → they pay 1 point → the **other player receives 1 point**.

This is a **penalty on A1**.

Let’s compute the **total payoff (base + contract)** for Player 1 under C1:

| Your Action | Other's Action | Base Payoff | Contract: You Pay? | You Receive from Other? | Total Payoff |
|------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| A0         | A0             | 5           | No                  | No                       | 5            |
| A0         | A1             | 0           | No                  | Yes (1 from other)       | 0 + 1 = 1    |
| A1         | A0             | 3           | Yes (pay 1)         | No                       | 3 - 1 = 2    |
| A1         | A1             | 3           | Yes (pay 1)         | Yes (receive 1 from other) | 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 |

So new total payoffs under C1:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Total Payoff |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 5                 |
| A0          | A1                | 1                 |
| A1          | A0                | 2                 |
| A1          | A1                | 3                 |

Now, let’s analyze best responses.

- If opponent plays A0:
  - You get 5 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1:
  - You get 1 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So **still two equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

But now:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A1, A1): 3

So (A0, A0) is still **stronger**.

But is (A0, A0) now **more stable**?

Let’s check if any player has incentive to deviate from (A0, A0):
- You: if you deviate to A1 while opponent plays A0 → get 2 vs 5 → not worth it → stay
- Opponent: same

So **(A0, A0)** is now **strictly better** than (A1, A1) for both players.

But more importantly: is (A1, A1) still an equilibrium?

- If you play A1, opponent plays A1 → you get 3
- Suppose you deviate to A0: you get 1 (since opponent plays A1) → worse than 3 → so no incentive to deviate

So (A1, A1) is still an equilibrium!

But the **payoff** is worse for you (3 vs 5), so you **prefer (A0,A0)**.

But both equilibria still exist. However, **the penalty on A1 makes A1 less attractive**, especially since in (A1, A0), you get only 2 instead of 3 (base) — so **reduced incentive to play A1**.

So C1 **does not eliminate the (A1, A1) equilibrium**, but it **makes (A0,A0) more attractive** for you.

Now — from **your perspective (Player 1)**:
- C1 shifts incentives slightly toward (A0, A0)
- But (A1, A1) is still an equilibrium, so you risk getting 3
- But if you trust coordination, (A0, A0) is possible and gives you 5

But here’s the key: **you are proposing C1**.
You **want it to pass**. But will Player 2 approve it?

Let’s look at Player 2’s payoff under C1.

#### Player 2’s Payoff under C1:

- If Player 2 plays A0 → nothing, unless Player 1 plays A1
- If Player 2 plays A1 → pays 1; gets 1 if Player 1 plays A1

So symmetric to you:

| P2 Action | P1 Action | P2 Base | P2 Pay from Contract | Total |
|----------|-----------|--------|------------------------|-------|
| A0       | A0        | 5      | 0                      | 5     |
| A0       | A1        | 3      | 1 (from P1)            | 4     |
| A1       | A0        | 0      | 0                      | 0     |
| A1       | A1        | 3      | 1 (from P1)            | 4     |

So Player 2’s payoffs under C1:

- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 4
- (A1, A0): 0 → very bad
- (A1, A1): 4

So Player 2:
- Prefers A0 if opponent plays A0 → 5 vs 0 → yes
- Prefers A1 if opponent plays A1 → 4 vs 0 → so (A1, A1) is equilibrium
- But in (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 0 → no incentive to play A1 if opponent plays A0

Best responses:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 5 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 4 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → indifferent

So (A0, A0) is still a **strict** equilibrium for P2 → stable.

But (A1, A1) is also equilibrium: if P2 plays A1, and P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 4; if P1 deviates to A0 → P2 gets 0 → worse, so no incentive.

So again, two equilibria.

But now, P2 **gets 5** in (A0, A0), 4 in (A1, A1)

So P2 also prefers (A0, A0) — **both players prefer (A0, A0)**.

So C1 **aligns incentives** in favor of (A0, A0).

So **C1 is good for both players** — but especially for you.

So Player 2 is **likely to approve C1**, because:
- It improves their payoff from (A1, A1) from 3 to 4
- They still get 5 in (A0, A0)
- They **don’t risk getting 0**, unlike if they play A1 against A0

So **C1 is beneficial for Player 2** → likely to approve.

Therefore, **C1 is a strong candidate**.

---

### **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- A0 → get 2 (from other player)
- A1 → pay 2 (to other player)

This is a **strong subsidy for A0**, **penalty for A1**.

Let’s compute **your payoff (Player 1)** under C2:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Base | Contract: You Pay? | You Receive? | Total |
|-------------|-------------------|------|------------------------|----------------|--------|
| A0          | A0                | 5    | No                     | Yes (2 from O) | 5 + 2 = 7 |
| A0          | A1                | 0    | No                     | No (opponent pays) | 0 + 0 = 0 |
| A1          | A0                | 3    | Yes (pay 2)            | No (opponent gets) | 3 - 2 = 1 |
| A1          | A1                | 3    | Yes (pay 2)            | Yes (receive 2) | 3 - 2 + 2 = 3 |

So your total payoffs under C2:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Total Payoff |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 7                 |
| A0          | A1                | 0                 |
| A1          | A0                | 1                 |
| A1          | A1                | 3                 |

Now, analyze best responses:

- If opponent plays A0:
  - You get 7 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1:
  - You get 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So again, two equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

But now:
- (A0, A0): you get 7 → **great for you**
- (A1, A1): you get 3 → same as before

But (A0, A1) is **very bad**: you get 0 if you play A0 and opponent plays A1.

So **incentive to coordinate on A0** is strong.

But let’s check if (A1, A1) is still equilibrium:

- You play A1, opponent plays A1 → you get 3
- If you deviate to A0 → you get 0 → worse → so no incentive → still equilibrium

So **C2 also has two equilibria**

But under C2:
- You get 7 in (A0, A0) → much better than base 5
- But you get 0 in (A0, A1) → very bad
- So you **strongly prefer** (A0, A0), but still risk getting 3 in (A1, A1)

Now — **would Player 2 approve C2?**

Let’s compute **Player 2’s payoff** under C2.

Symmetric logic:

| P2 Action | P1 Action | P2 Base | Contract: P2 Pays? | P2 Gets? | Total |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------------------|------------|--------|
| A0        | A0        | 5       | No                     | Yes (2)   | 7      |
| A0        | A1        | 3       | No                     | No (pay 2) | 3 - 2 = 1? Wait! | No

Wait — **important**:

The contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive 2 points, drawn **equally from the other players**"

So if **Player 2 chooses A0**, they **get 2 points**, and the **other player (Player 1)** pays 2.

Similarly, if Player 2 chooses A1, they **pay 2**, and the other player (Player 1) gets 2.

So:

#### Player 2's Payoff under C2:

| P2 | P1 | P2 Base | P2 Payment | P2 Receives? | P2 Total |
|----|----|---------|------------|----------------|----------|
| A0 | A0 | 5       | 0          | 2 (from P1)    | 7        |
| A0 | A1 | 3       | 0          | 0 (P1 plays A1 → P1 pays) → but **P1 pays only if P1 plays A1**, so **P2 gets 0?** Wait.

No: **the payment is triggered by the player’s own action**.

So P2’s **received** payment depends **only on whether P2 chooses A0 or A1**.

If P2 chooses A0 → receives 2 from the other player (P1), **regardless of what P1 does**?

No — the contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn from the other players" → so even if other player chooses A1, **the payment still comes from them**?

But **if P1 chooses A1**, P1 is **paying 2**, so they can't give 2.

The phrasing is ambiguous.

But likely, the **payment is from the other player**, meaning that **the other player must pay the 2**, so it’s **only valid if the other player can afford or is responsible**.

But the rules don’t specify if payments are enforced or if the other player can’t pay.

But in game theory, we **assume payments are made as long as the rule is followed**, unless payment is linked to actions in a way that prevents it.

Let’s look back:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn from the other players" → implies the other player **pays**.

So if you play A0, you **get 2 from the other player**.

But if the other player chose A1, they are **already paying 2** — for their own action.

But the contract doesn’t say "if you choose A0, your counterpart pays 2", but rather "you get 2 drawn equally from the other players".

This suggests that **every time a player plays A0, they receive 2**, and **if multiple players play A0, the cost is shared**.

But there are only two players.

So:

- If **Player 2 plays A0**, they **get 2 from Player 1**, no matter what Player 1 does.
- If Player 1 plays A1, they are **paying 2** — so they **must pay 2 to Player 2** — even if they are already paying 2 for their own action.

Is this a problem?

Let’s assume the **contract is binding**, and payments are made as per rules, even if the player would end up with negative points.

So:

- Player 1, if they play A1, must **pay 2**
- But **if Player 2 plays A0**, Player 1 must **give 2 to Player 2**
- So if both play A1 → Player 1 pays 2 for A1 → but **no one else** is receiving from A0, so no additional payment?
No.

The contract: "if a player chooses A0, they receive 2"

So if **Player 2 chooses A0**, they receive 2 → so **Player 1 must pay 2 to them**

If **Player 1 chooses A0**, they receive 2 → so **Player 2 must pay 2 to them**

So the payment is **based on your own action**, not whether the other player is "funding" it.

But in a two-player game, if **both** players choose A0:
- Player 1 receives 2 from Player 2
- Player 2 receives 2 from Player 1

So no net cost — each is gaining 2.

If **Player 1 chooses A1**, they **must pay 2**, to the other player (if that player plays A0)

If **Player 2 chooses A0**, they get 2 from Player 1, **even if Player 1 plays A1**

But **Player 1 is already paying 2 for choosing A1**, so they **must pay 2** again to Player 2 — so total deduction: 4?

That’s possible.

So let’s **recompute Player 2’s payoff under C2**:

| P2 | P1 | P2 Base | P2 Action → P2 gets? | P1 Action → P1 pays? | P2 gets from P1? | P2 Total |
|----|----|--------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| A0 | A0 | 5      | Yes (A0) → gets 2      | P1 plays A0 → gets 2 → but P2 **pays**? No → P2 doesn't pay | P2 gets 2 from P1 | 5 + 2 = 7 |
| A0 | A1 | 3      | Yes (A0) → gets 2      | P1 plays A1 → P1 pays 2 → P2 gets 2 | P2 gets 2 from P1 | 3 + 2 = 5 |
| A1 | A0 | 0      | No (A1) → gets 0       | P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 2 → so P2 **pays** 2? No — P2 doesn't pay for A1? Wait.

The rule:
> If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So if P2 chooses A1 → P2 **pays 2**, to the other players.

There is **one other player**, so P2 **pays 2 to Player 1**.

Similarly, if P1 chooses A1 → P1 pays 2 to Player 2.

So let’s do correct table:

#### Player 2 Payoff under C2:

| P2 | P1 | P2 Base | P2 gets from A0? | P2 pays for A1? | P2 gets from P1? | P2 pays to P1? | P2 Total |
|----|----|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| A0 | A0 | 5      | Yes (A0) → +2     | No (A0) → no pay | P1 gets 2 (A0) → so P2 gives 2 to P1? No → P2 gets from P1 only if P2 plays A0 — yes → P2 **gets 2 from P1** → P1 pays 2 | P2 pays 0 → P2 gets 2 from P1 | 5 + 2 = 7 |
| A0 | A1 | 3      | Yes → +2          | No → no pay       | P1 plays A1 → pays 2 → so P2 **gets 2 from P1** → yes | P2 pays 0 | 3 + 2 = 5 |
| A1 | A0 | 0      | No (A1) → 0       | Yes (A1) → pay 2 → so P2 pays 2 to P1 | P1 plays A0 → gets 2 from P2 → but P2 is paying 2 to P1 anyway → P2 gives 2 to P1 | P2 pays 2 | 0 - 2 = -2 |
| A1 | A1 | 3      | No → 0            | Yes → pay 2 → pays 2 to P1 | P1 plays A1 → pays 2 to P2 → so P2 gets 2 from P1 | P2 pays 2, gets 2 → net 0 | 3 + 0 = 3 |

So Player 2’s total payoffs:

- (A0, A0): 7
- (A0, A1): 5
- (A1, A0): -2
- (A1, A1): 3

Now, from **Player 2’s perspective**:

- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 7 (A0) vs -2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P2’s best response is always A0**!

No matter what P1 does, P2 should play A0.

This is **huge**.

So if C2 is in place, **Player 2 will always play A0**, because it's strictly dominant.

Then, you (Player 1) will respond to P2 playing A0.

Your best response:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - You get 7 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0

So you will play A0.

Thus, **C2 leads to (A0, A0) with certainty**, and **you get 7 points**.

This is **extremely good** for you.

Now, **would Player 2 approve C2?**

Let’s see: under C2, **Player 2 gets 7** in (A0, A0), 5 in (A0, A1), -2 in (A1, A0), 3 in (A1, A1)

But since Player 2 **will always play A0**, they **cannot end up in (A0, A1)** unless you play A1.

But you are rational — you will play A0 in response to A0.

So **Player 2 will get 7** if they play A0.

But if there were no contract, and both play A0, they get 5.

Here they get 7 → **better**.

Even if they were uncertain, their **expected payoff is at least 5**, and **maximum 7**.

But **crucially**, they have a **strictly dominant strategy** to play A0.

So **C2 makes Player 2** better off in all outcomes, and they **have a strong incentive to play A0**.

So **Player 2 will strongly approve C2** — it gives them a dominant strategy and better minimum payoff.

Therefore, **C2 is likely to be approved by both players**.

And if it passes, you get **7 points** — much better than the base game or C1.

C1 gives you max 5 (in A0,A0), but C2 gives you 7 in same outcome.

So **C2 is strictly better for you** than C1.

But can both contracts pass?

Only one contract is selected at random from those with **maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve **both**, and Player 2 approves **both**, then both have approval count 2.

Then **one is selected uniformly at random** between C1 and C2.

So your **expected payoff** is:

- P(C1 selected) = 0.5 → you get max 5
- P(C2 selected) = 0.5 → you get 7

So **expected payoff = (5 + 7)/2 = 6**

But if you **only approve C2**, then only C2 has 2 approvals (assuming Player 2 approves it), and C1 has 1 (only you approve), so C2 wins.

Then you get **7 with certainty**.

Similarly, if you approve only C1, and Player 2 approves C1, then C1 wins → you get 5.

But **Player 2 likely approves both**, because:
- C1: they get 5 (in A0,A0), 4 in A1,A1 → better than base 5,3
- C2: they get 7 (A0,A0) → much better

So **C2 is better for Player 2**.

So **Player 2 will prefer C2** over C1.

So if you approve **both**, and C2 is better, **Player 2 might still approve both, but will prefer C2**.

But the **approval process** is **approval voting** – players can vote for multiple contracts.

So Player 2 can approve both C1 and C2.

But if both are approved by both players, then **both have 2 approvals**, so one is chosen at random.

Then you get **expected 6**.

But **if you only approve C2**, then only C2 has 2 approvals → **C2 wins for sure** → you get 7.

Similarly, if you only approve C1, you get 5.

So **your best strategy is to only approve C2**, and thus **guarantee** getting the high payoff.

But is C2 good for Player 2?

Yes — they get 7 in (A0,A0), which is greater than 5 in base game.

They get at least 3 in worst case, and have a dominant strategy.

So they will approve C2.

But would they approve C1?

C1 gives them:
- (A0,A0): 5 → same as base
- (A1,A1): 4 → better than 3

But they also risk (A1,A0): 0 → worse than base

But in C2, they **cannot get less than 3**, and **cannot get 0**, and have **dominant strategy**.

So **C2 is strictly better** than C1 for Player 2.

Therefore, **Player 2 will approve C2, but may or may not approve C1**.

But since C2 gives higher payoff, and better incentives, they **will approve C2**.

But do they have to? They can approve both.

But since **you want to minimize randomness**, you should **only approve C2**, so that C2 wins with certainty.

If you approve both, and Player 2 approves both, then **both have 2 approvals**, so one is chosen at random → you get expected 6.

But if you **only approve C2**, and Player 2 approves C2, then C2 has 2 approvals, C1 has only 1 (yours), so C2 is selected.

Thus, you get **7 for sure**.

So **you should only approve C2**.

Now, **what about C1?**

C1 is worse for you than C2 (5 vs 7 max), and C2 is better for Player 2.

So **you should not approve C1**.

But what if Player 2 doesn’t approve C1?

Then C1 has only 1 approval (yours), while C2 has 2 → C2 wins.

So no harm in approving C1 — but no benefit.

And if you approve C1, you risk C1 being selected (if both approve, random choice) → you get only 5 instead of 7.

So **you should NOT approve C1**.

**Conclusion:**

- Approve C2 → sure 7 points
- Don’t approve C1 → avoid risk of getting only 5

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

- **C1 (Player 1’s proposal)**: **False** — worse for you than C2, and you want to avoid risk
- **C2 (Player 2’s proposal)**: **True** — gives you 7 with certainty (if approved by both), and Player 2 will approve it

### ✅ Final Answer (JSON):

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

The payoff matrix (from my perspective as Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 5, Other gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, Other gets 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, Other gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, Other gets 3

This game has two Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0) → payoff (5,5)** - the better outcome
- **(A1, A1) → payoff (3,3)** - the worse outcome

The problem is coordination - there's a risk of ending up at the inferior equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

With a 1-point penalty for playing A1:

My payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 0 + 0 = **5**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 0 + 1 = **1** (I receive other's penalty)
- (A1, A0): 3 - 1 + 0 = **2** (I pay penalty)
- (A1, A1): 3 - 1 + 1 = **3** (both pay, both receive)

Checking Nash equilibria:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > 2) ✓
- If other plays A1: I prefer A1 (3 > 1) ✓

**Result:** Still has both equilibria (A0,A0) and (A1,A1). The coordination problem remains!

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2  

With a 4-point penalty for playing A1:

My payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 0 + 0 = **5**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 0 + 4 = **4** (I receive other's penalty)
- (A1, A0): 3 - 4 + 0 = **-1** (I pay penalty)
- (A1, A1): 3 - 4 + 4 = **3** (both pay, both receive)

Checking best responses:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > -1) ✓
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (4 > 3) ✓

**Result:** A0 is now my **dominant strategy**! By symmetry, A0 is also the other player's dominant strategy. This guarantees the unique Nash equilibrium (A0, A0) with payoff **5 for both players**.

## Step 4: Strategic approval decision

Contract 2 is strictly better than Contract 1 because:
- C2 guarantees payoff of 5 (by making A0 dominant)
- C1 still has coordination risk (could get stuck at payoff 3)

If I approve only C2:
- When combined with rational play from Player 1, C2 has the best chance of being selected
- Approving C1 could dilute support for C2 or allow C1 to win outright

**Conclusion:** I should approve only Contract 2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from Player 1's perspective):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

So:

- If both play A0 → (5,5)
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → (0,3)
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → (3,0)
- If both play A1 → (3,3)

This is a variant of a coordination game with a Nash equilibrium at (A0, A0), but (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium because neither player can do better by unilaterally deviating.

Let’s analyze:

- If both stick to A0 → 5 each → best possible
- But if P1 thinks P2 will play A0, P1 prefers A0 (5 > 3)
- If P1 thinks P2 will play A1, P1 prefers A1 (3 > 0), so A1 dominates A0 in that case
- Similarly, for P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A1 (3 > 5)? Wait: no — if P1 plays A0, and P2 plays A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → so P2 prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1, then P2 gets 0 (if plays A0) vs. 3 (if plays A1) → so P2 prefers A1

So both players prefer A0 if the other plays A0, and prefer A1 if the other plays A1.

Thus, (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are both Nash equilibria.

But (A0,A0) is better for both — socially optimal.

So a contract might help coordinate on (A0,A0), or make (A0,A0) more stable.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

A contract adds transfer payments based on the action played. The payments are made **in addition to** the base payoffs.

The contract is **only effective if both players approve it** — but the twist says:

> "The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if multiple contracts are approved by the same number of players (or both), the **one with the most approvals is chosen** — and if there’s a tie, pick uniformly at random.

But we are **Player 1**, and we are to **approve or disapprove each contract**.

Our goal: **Maximize our expected total points** in the game, assuming:

- We choose strategies (probabilities over A0 and A1) optimally.
- The other player also chooses optimally.
- The contract is in place.
- The contract is picked randomly from those with max approvals (if multiple).

But we have to decide which contracts to approve **before** the other player makes their decision (since it's an approval voting process).

So we must **choose which contracts we would approve**, based on **how they affect our own expected payoff**, **given that we will then play the game under the contract**, and **possibly** under the assumption that the other player also acts optimally.

We are not told whether players are rational or how they behave — but since it’s a decision-making game, we assume **common knowledge of rationality**, so we assume both players will play optimally in response to the contract.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Each Contract**

Let’s define:

- Contract C1: Proposed by **Player 1**
- Contract C2: Proposed by **Player 2**

We are Player 1.

---

#### ✅ **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**

> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payments
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 1 point, **distributed equally among the other players**

Since there are two players, “other players” means the **other one**.

So:
- If a player plays A1 → they pay 1 point to the other player
- If a player plays A0 → nothing

So transfer:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | You get (base) | You pay (transfer) | You net |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5              | 0                  | 5      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0              | 0                  | 0      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3              | -1                 | 2      |
| A1          | A1                     | 3              | -1                 | 2      |

Wait, let's clarify: **"they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players"**

So if **you** play A1 → you pay 1 point to the other player.

Same for the other player.

So transfers depend only on **your own action**, not the other's.

So net payoff (total) is:

- (A0, A0): you get 5 + 0 = 5
- (A0, A1): you get 0 + 0 = 0
- (A1, A0): you get 3 - 1 = 2 (you pay 1 to P2)
- (A1, A1): you get 3 - 1 = 2 (you pay 1 to P2)

So the **new payoff matrix (Player 1)**:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5      | 0      |
| **P1: A1** | 2      | 2      |

Now, Player 1's best response:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 prefers A0 (5 > 2)
- If P2 plays A1: P1 is indifferent (2 = 2)

So P1 should play A0 if P2 plays A0, and may mix when P2 plays A1.

Now check P2’s incentives.

P2 also pays 1 if P2 plays A1.

So from P2’s perspective:

- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 3 (base) + 0 (no payment, since P2 played A1 but paid 1 to P1) → wait: P2 plays A1 → pays 1 to P1 → so P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2? No!

Hold on.

The contract says: "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players."

So:
- If **P2** plays A1 → P2 pays 1 point to P1
- If **P1** plays A1 → P1 pays 1 point to P2

So the net payoff matrix from **Player 2's perspective**:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5      | 3 - 1 = 2 |
| **P1: A1** | 0 + 1 = 1 | 3 - 1 = 2 |

Explanation:

- (P1: A0, P2: A0): both A0 → no payment → (5,5)
- (P1: A0, P2: A1): P2 plays A1 → pays 1 to P1 → P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2
- (P1: A1, P2: A0): P1 plays A1 → pays 1 to P2 → P2 gets 0 + 1 = 1
- (P1: A1, P2: A1): P1 pays 1 to P2, P2 pays 1 to P1 → net transfer is zero? Wait: payments are **independent**.

Important: The transfer is **not** net. Each player pays **their own** payment.

So even if both play A1, each pays 1 to the other → net transfer is zero.

So:
- (A1,A1): P1 gets 3 - 1 = 2
- P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2

So P2's net payoffs:

- (A0,A0): 5
- (A0,A1): 3 - 1 = 2
- (A1,A0): 0 + 1 = 1 (P1 pays 1 to P2)
- (A1,A1): 3 - 1 = 2

So P2’s matrix:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5      | 2      |
| **P1: A1** | 1      | 2      |

Now, let’s analyze Nash equilibria under C1.

From **P1’s** view:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0 (5 > 2)
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 is indifferent (2 = 2)

From **P2’s** view:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 prefers A0 (5 > 2)
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 1 if A0, 2 if A1 → so prefers A1

So let’s examine:

- (A0,A0): P1 → A0 optimal given A0 (5 > 2), P2 → A0 optimal given A0 (5 > 2) → **Nash equilibrium**
- (A0,A1): P1 gets 0 (from earlier? Wait, no — in C1, if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1: P1 gets base 0 + no payment → 0; P2 gets base 3 - 1 = 2 → but from P1’s perspective: 0; P2’s perspective: 2. But is (A0,A1) stable?

Check P1: given P2 plays A1, P1 gets 2 if A1, 0 if A0 → so prefers A1, not A0 → not equilibrium.

Check (A1,A0): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 1.

P1: given P2 A0 → prefers A0 (5 > 2) → so not playing best response → invalid

Check (A1,A1): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 2.

P1: given P2 A1 → indifferent → A1 is OK (as good as A0)
P2: given P1 A1 → gets 1 if A0, 2 if A1 → so prefers A1 → so **yes**, (A1,A1) is Nash

So two equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Now, **which one will be selected**?

Under C1, both are Nash, so both possible.

But **(A0,A0)** gives P1: 5, P2: 5

**(A1,A1)** gives P1: 2, P2: 2

So P1 would prefer (A0,A0) to (A1,A1)

But is (A0,A0) stable? Yes, as shown.

But if the players coordinate on (A0,A0), P1 gets 5.

If they coordinate on (A1,A1), P1 gets 2.

But **do they coordinate?**

In a game with multiple equilibria, the **focal point** or **risk-dominance** may matter.

Alternatively, suppose both players are rational and aim to maximize their own payoff.

P1 wants (A0,A0), P2 also wants (A0,A0) — both get 5 vs 2.

So **(A0,A0)** is **Pareto-dominant**.

So if they can coordinate, they will.

But in a simultaneous move game with no communication, they might fail — but here we’re assuming rational play, so probably they will coordinate on the more efficient equilibrium.

But is there any reason to avoid (A0,A0)? No.

So **under C1, it’s likely that both players play A0**, giving P1: 5.

But wait — is that actually the best?

Suppose P1 thinks P2 might play A1.

Then P1 should play A1 (gets 2 vs 0), but P2, if P1 plays A0, would prefer A0 (5 > 2), so doesn’t want to play A1.

So actually, the risk of coordination failure is minimal — both players have incentive to play A0 if they think the other will.

So **with C1, (A0,A0) is a strong equilibrium**.

So **P1 can expect 5** under C1.

But is that always true?

Wait: the payment is **only if you play A1**, so if P1 plays A0, no cost.

But P2 might still play A1, but if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 0.

But P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 5 (if A0) vs 2 (if A1) → so P2 prefers A0.

So unless there’s a mistake in beliefs, they will both play A0.

So **C1 leads to A0-A0** with high probability, P1 gets 5.

But what if both are risk-averse?

But we assume rational best-response.

So under **C1**, both players have strong incentive to play A0.

So **P1 expects to get 5 points** under C1.

But wait: could a mixed equilibrium arise?

Suppose P2 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p)

P1's payoff:
- A0: p*5 + (1-p)*0 = 5p
- A1: p*2 + (1-p)*2 = 2

So P1 plays A0 if 5p > 2 → p > 2/5

So if p > 0.4, P1 plays A0

Now P2's best response:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 if A0, 2 if A1 → so prefers A0 → p=1
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 if A0, 2 if A1 → prefers A1 → so p=0

So only rational equilibria are at the extremes.

The only fixed points:
- p = 1 → P2 plays A0 → P1 best responds with A0 → so (A0,A0) is NE
- p = 0 → P1 plays A1 → P2 best responds with A1 → so (A1,A1) is NE

No interior NE.

So only two equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Now, since (A0,A0) Pareto-dominates, and both players benefit from it, and it's **the only symmetric equilibrium**, and has higher payoff, it is likely to be chosen.

Thus, **under C1, we expect payoff = 5**

---

#### ❌ **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):**

> - If a player chooses A0: they receive an additional 2 points, **drawn equally from the other players**
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay 2 points, **distributed equally to the other players**

So:

- A0 → +2, paid by the other player
- A1 → -2, paid by you to the other player

Note: this affects both players.

Let’s compute the net payoff matrix.

**Player 1's perspective:**

- (A0, A0): both get +2 → base: 5, plus transfer: +2 → total: 7
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +2; P2 plays A1 → so P2 pays 2 to P1 → so P1 gets +2 (from playing A0) + 2 (from P2's payment) = +4 → plus base 0 → total: 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → pays 2 to P2; P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +2 from A0 → so P1 gets base 3, minus 2 (payment), plus nothing? Wait.

Let’s clarify:

- When a player plays A0 → they get +2, paid by **other players**
- When a player plays A1 → they pay 2, to **other players**

So the transfers are **independent**.

So:

| P1 | P2 | P1 base | P1 transfer |
|----|----|---------|-------------|
| A0 | A0 | 5       | +2 (from P2's A0) |
| A0 | A1 | 0       | +2 (from P2's A1? No!) → Wait, P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 2 → but **to whom?** The contract says: "distributed equally among the other players"

So if P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 2 → goes to the other player → P1

But P1 plays A0 → gets +2 from playing A0 → so **P1 gets +2 (from A0) + 2 (from P2's A1 payment)** = +4

But P1 also receives from A0 action → yes.

So both sources.

Similarly:

- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → pays 2 to P2
- P1 plays A0? No — A1 → so P1 does **not** get +2 from A0
- P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +2, paid by P1 → so P1 **pays** 2 to P2
- P1’s base payoff is 3 (from A1, A0)
- P1 pays 2 → net: 3 - 2 = 1

- (A1, A1): P1 plays A1 → pays 2 → so loses 2
- P1 plays A1 → so does **not** get +2 from A0
- P2 plays A1 → so P2 pays 2 → goes to P1
- P1’s base: 3
- P1 pays 2 to P2 → net: -2
- P1 receives 2 from P2 → net: +2
- So total: 3 - 2 + 2 = 3

Let’s tabulate:

**Player 1’s net payoff:**

| P1 | P2 | Base | P1 transfer | Total |
|----|----|------|-------------|-------|
| A0 | A0 | 5    | +2 (P2 pays for A1? No!) → P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +2 (from P1) → so P1 pays 2 to P2 → so P1 loses 2 from transfer | 5 - 2 = 3? Wait, no!

Wait! Critical mistake.

The transfer is **based on your own action**.

- If you play A0 → you get +2 (paid by the other player)
- If you play A1 → you pay 2 (to the other player)

So:
- P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +2
- P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +2

But who pays whom?

When a player plays A0 → they receive +2 → so the **other player must pay**.

So if P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +2 → so P1 must pay 2 to P2.

Similarly, if P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +2 → so P2 must pay 2 to P1.

If P1 plays A1 → P1 pays 2 → to P2
If P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 2 → to P1

So the net transfer is:

- If both play A0: P1 pays 2 to P2, P2 pays 2 to P1 → net zero → but each gets +2 from their own A0?
No: "receive an additional payment of 2" when choosing A0 — so they **gain 2** — but to fund that, the other player pays.

Thus:
- When P1 plays A0 → P1 gains 2
- To fund this, P2 must pay 2 to P1 → so P2 loses 2

Similarly:
- When P2 plays A0 → P2 gains 2 → P1 pays 2 to P2

So if **both** play A0:
- P1: gains 2 (from A0), pays 2 (because P2 plays A0) → net 0
- P2: gains 2, pays 2 → net 0

So net transfer is zero, but both are **net 0** from transfers.

But they **get** +2 from their A0, but **lose** 2 to the other player.

So net: 0

Similarly:
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1:
  - P1: gets +2 (from A0), pays 2 (because P2 plays A1, so P2 pays 2 to P1) → so P1 gets +2 (from A0) + 2 (from P2's payment) = +4
  - P2: gets +2 (from A0? no — P2 plays A1) → so P2 gets -2 (pays 2), and P1 plays A0 → so P1 pays 2 to P2 → so P2 gets +2 (from P1)
  - So P2: -2 + 2 = 0
  - But P2's base payoff is 3 → so net: 3 + 0 = 3

Wait, better to compute net total:

Let’s define clearly.

For **Player 1**:

| P1 | P2 | Base | P1's transfer | Total |
|----|----|------|----------------|--------|
| A0 | A0 | 5    | +2 (from A0) - 2 (P2's A0 payment) = 0 → net 0 | 5 + 0 = 5 |
| A0 | A1 | 0    | +2 (A0) + 2 (P2's A1 payment) = +4 | 0 + 4 = 4 |
| A1 | A0 | 3    | -2 (A1 payment) + 2 (P2's A0 payment) = 0 | 3 + 0 = 3 |
| A1 | A1 | 3    | -2 (A1) - 2 (P2's A1 → P2 pays 2 to P1) → so P1 gets +2 from P2's action → net: -2 + 2 = 0 | 3 + 0 = 3 |

Wait:
- P1 plays A1 → pays 2 → so loses 2
- P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 2 → so P1 gains 2 → net: 0
- So total: 3

Similarly:
- (A0,A0): 
  - P1 plays A0 → +2
  - P2 plays A0 → P1 pays 2 → so net transfer: 0
  - Base: 5 → total: 5

- (A0,A1):
  - P1: A0 → +2, A1 from P2 → P2 pays 2 to P1 → so +2 → net +4
  - Base: 0 → total: 4

- (A1,A0):
  - P1: A1 → -2
  - P2: A0 → P2 gains +2, so P1 pays 2 → so P1 loses 2
  - Net transfer: -2 -2? No: P1 plays A1 → pays 2
  - P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +2 → so P1 must pay 2 → so P1 pays 2 to P2
  - So P1 pays 2 for A1, pays 2 for P2’s A0 → total -4?
  - No, wait: the transfer is not additive in that way.

Clarify:

The contract says:
- If you play A0 → you receive 2 (paid by other player)
- If you play A1 → you pay 2 (to other player)

So **only your own action matters**.

So transfer to you depends only on **your own action**.

That is, **you receive 2 if you play A0**, and **you pay 2 if you play A1**, regardless of what the other does.

But wait: the funding — it says "drawn equally from the other players", but there's only one other player.

So to fund the 2 for you, the other player pays it.

So:
- If you play A0 → the other player pays you 2
- If you play A1 → you pay 2 to the other player

So **your net transfer** is:
- +2 if you play A0
- -2 if you play A1

**Regardlesss of what the other does**

But is that sustainable? Only if the other player agrees.

But in this contract, the **payments are fixed per action**, so:

- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +2, and P2 **must pay** 2 to P1
- If P1 plays A1 → P1 pays 2 to P2
- If P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +2, so P1 must pay 2 to P2
- If P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 2 to P1

So **P1’s net transfer**:
- If P1 plays A0 → gets +2 from rule
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 must pay 2 → so P1 loses 2
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 gets +2 (from P2’s A1 payment)

But the contract doesn’t say the transfer is from both — it's **per player**, so each player's action triggers a payment.

For **P1**, the total transfer depends on:

- P1’s action: +2 if A0, -2 if A1
- P2’s action: if P2 plays A0 → P1 pays 2 to P2 → so P1 loses 2
- if P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 2 to P1 → so P1 gains 2

So P1’s total transfer:
- A0, A0: +2 (P1's A0) - 2 (P1 pays for P2's A0) = 0
- A0, A1: +2 (A0) + 2 (P2's A1 payment) = +4
- A1, A0: -2 (A1) - 2 (P1 pays for P2's A0) = -4
- A1, A1: -2 (A1) + 2 (P2's A1) = 0

Thus P1’s total payoff:

| P1 | P2 | Base | Transfer | Total |
|----|----|------|----------|--------|
| A0 | A0 | 5    | 0        | 5      |
| A0 | A1 | 0    | +4       | 4      |
| A1 | A0 | 3    | -4       | -1     |
| A1 | A1 | 3    | 0        | 3      |

P2’s payoffs:

- (A0,A0): +2 (A0) -2 (P1 pays for A0) = 0 → base 5 + 0 = 5
- (A0,A1): +2 (A0) + 2 (P1's A1) = +4 → base 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1,A0): -2 (A1) -2 (P1's A0 → P1 must pay P2) = -4 → base 3 -4 = -1
- (A1,A1): -2 (A1) +2 (P1's A1) = 0 → base 3 + 0 = 3

So P2’s matrix:

| P1 | P2 | Base | Transfer | Total |
|----|----|------|----------|--------|
| A0 | A0 | 5    | 0        | 5      |
| A0 | A1 | 3    | +4       | 7      |
| A1 | A0 | 0    | -4       | -4     |
| A1 | A1 | 3    | 0        | 3      |

Now, from **P1’s** perspective (Player 1), we have:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5      | 4      |
| **P1: A1** | -1     | 3      |

P1's best responses:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0 (5 > -1)
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 prefers A0 (4 > 3)

So **P1 always prefers A0**, no matter what P2 does.

So **A0 is dominant strategy for P1**.

Now P2:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2: A0 → 5, A1 → 7 → so prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1 → P2: A0 → -4, A1 → 3 → prefers A1

So **P2 always prefers A1**, regardless of P1.

So:

- P1: A0 dominant
- P2: A1 dominant

So **unique Nash equilibrium**: (A0, A1)

P1 gets 4, P2 gets 7

So under C2, **P1 gets 4**

But wait — the only equilibrium is (A0,A1), with P1 getting 4.

So **expected payoff for P1 under C2 is 4**

Compared to **C1**, which gives P1 5.

Also, under C2, P1 cannot get 5 — the best is 4.

Moreover, P1 is playing A0, but P2 is playing A1 → so P1 gets 4 (base 0 + transfer +4)

But is it sustainable? Yes.

So **P1's expected payoff under C2 is 4**

---

### **Step 4: Compare and Decide Approvals**

- **C1 (proposed by P1)**: P1 gets 5
- **C2 (proposed by P2)**: P1 gets 4

So **C1 is better for P1**

But we must decide which **contracts to approve**, based on **how many approvals and the randomness**.

The winning contract is selected **uniformly at random** from those with **maximum number of approvals**.

We are Player 1.

We want to **maximize our expected points**.

So we should **approve C1**, since it gives us 5.

What about C2?

Approving C2 gives us only 4 in the game, but if we approve it, then if it wins, we get 4.

But since C1 gives us 5 and C2 gives us 4, we prefer C1.

However, approval matters for **winning chance**.

Suppose we:
- Approve C1 only → then C1 has 1 approval (by us), C2 has 0 → C1 wins → we get 5
- Approve C2 only → C2 wins → we get 4
- Approve both → both have 1 approval → max approvals = 1 → then winner chosen uniformly from {C1, C2} → so with 50% chance C1, 50% chance C2 → expected payoff = 0.5*5 + 0.5*4 = 4.5

But 4.5 < 5 — so worse than just approving C1.

Suppose we reject both → no contract, game is played with no contract.

What happens then?

Base game: equilibria at (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

P1 prefers (A0,A0) → gets 5

But (A1,A1) gives 3.

If they coordinate on (A0,A0), P1 gets 5.

But if not, might get less.

But since both players can get 5 at (A0,A0), and it's a symmetric equilibrium, likely they play it.

So **expected payoff without contract** is likely 5.

But in C1, we also get 5.

So without contract or with C1, we get 5.

With C2, we get 4.

So not worse than no contract.

But if we approve both, expected payoff is 4.5 < 5.

So the **best** is to **approve only C1**

Then C1 wins (only one with approval), we get 5.

If we approve C2, it doesn’t help — we get 4 only if it wins, but we lose expected payoff.

So we should **approve only C1**

response:
Let's break down the decision step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Basics
You and the other player have two possible actions (A0 and A1) and each action has specific payoffs.

**Payoffs without Contract:**
- (A0, A0): You get 5, Other gets 5
- (A0, A1): You get 0, Other gets 3
- (A1, A0): You get 3, Other gets 0
- (A1, A1): You get 3, Other gets 3

### Step 2: Introduce the Contract
The contract changes the payoffs by adding or subtracting 2 points for each player based on their actions:
- Choose A0: Gain 2 points (drawn from the other player)
- Choose A1: Lose 2 points (given to the other player)

Let's adjust the original payoffs according to the contract:

**Payoffs with Contract (if both sign):**
- (A0, A0): 
  - You get 5 + 2 = 7
  - Other gets 5 + 2 = 7
- (A0, A1): 
  - You get 0 + 2 = 2
  - Other gets 3 - 2 = 1
- (A1, A0): 
  - You get 3 - 2 = 1
  - Other gets 0 + 2 = 2
- (A1, A1): 
  - You get 3 - 2 = 1
  - Other gets 3 - 2 = 1

### Step 3: Compare Payoffs
Compare the strategies and payoffs with and without the contract:

**Without Contract:**
- The only way to maximize (expecting to match the other player's rationality) is to both play A0, resulting in 5 points each.

**With Contract:**
- Both playing A0 becomes even more beneficial (7 points each).
- Even if mismatched, the penalties and gains redistributed still result in mutual encouragement to play A0:
  - (A0, A1): 2 points vs 1 point
  - (A1, A0): 1 point vs 2 points

### Step 4: Decision for Signing Contract
- With the contract, mutual cooperation (both playing A0) increases the overall payoff to 7 points each from 5 points.
- The incentives align better as playing A0 is more attractive, and it prevents both from gaining significantly less from misalignment strategies.

### Conclusion
Since the contract makes the mutual cooperation strategy more beneficial, and less risky for both players, it is in your best interest to sign the contract.

### Final Answer
Therefore:
```json
{"sign": true}
```

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses between **A0** or **A1**.

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

|         | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

We are playing as **Player 1**, and our goal is to **maximize our total expected points**.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria and see what kind of behavior we might expect.

#### **Best Responses**

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1 gets 5 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1 gets 0 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So Player 1’s best response depends on Player 2’s move.

Similarly for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 5 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 0 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A1

Now let’s find Nash equilibria.

- (A0, A0): both get 5
  - If Player 1 deviates to A1: gets 3 < 5 → no incentive
  - If Player 2 deviates to A1: gets 3 < 5 → no incentive
  → **Nash equilibrium**

- (A1, A1): both get 3
  - Player 1: if deviates to A0 vs A1 → gets 0 < 3 → no incentive
  - Player 2: if deviates to A0 vs A1 → gets 0 < 3 → no incentive
  → **Nash equilibrium**

- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 3
  - Player 1 can deviate to A1 and get 3 > 0 → not equilibrium

- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3, Player 2 gets 0
  - Player 2 can deviate to A1 and get 3 > 0 → not equilibrium

So there are **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Also, we can check for mixed strategies, but let’s hold off for now.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract System**

A **contract** can be implemented **if both players approve it** via **approval voting**. Then, among all contracts with the **maximum number of approvals**, **one is selected uniformly at random**.

- We (Player 1) get to **approve or disapprove each contract**.
- Our goal: **maximize our expected total points**.
- So we need to **evaluate** each contract’s impact on our **expected payoff**, considering:
  - Whether the contract will be selected (depends on approvals)
  - How it changes payoffs
  - How it might influence the other player’s strategy

But note: **We do not know if Player 2 will approve** any contract. So we must **anticipate Player 2’s behavior**.

But we **only control our own approvals**.

---

### **Contract 1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payment.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If you play A1 → you **lose 1 point** (you pay 1)
- If you play A0 → no cost or gain
- The payment is **distributed to other players** — so if both players play A1, each pays 1 → each gets -1, so each loses 1

Let’s compute **net payoffs** under this contract, and **how it changes the game**.

We are Player 1.

Let’s revise the payoff matrix under C1.

#### New Payoffs (with C1):

|         | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5 - 0, 5 - 0) = (5, 5) | (0 - 0, 3 - 0) = (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3 - 1, 0 - 1) = (2, -1) | (3 - 1, 3 - 1) = (2, 2) |

Wait: **Only the player who chooses A1 pays 1**, *and* the payment is distributed equally to **other players**.

So if **you** choose A1, you lose 1, and **the other player gets +1**.

So:
- If **P1 plays A1**, and P2 plays A0:  
  - P1: base = 3, loses 1 → 2  
  - P2: base = 0, gets +1 → 1

- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1:  
  - P1: base = 3, loses 1 → 2  
  - P2: base = 3, loses 1 → 2

- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0: both get 5
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3 + 1 = 4 (because P2 chose A1, so they pay 1 and get +1 from P1 not playing A1? Wait — confusion.

Let’s clarify:

> “If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.”

So:
- **When a player chooses A1**, they **lose 1 point** (pay) → this 1 point is **given to the OTHER players**.

So if **only one player chooses A1**, that player loses 1, and the **other player gets +1**.

If **both choose A1**, each loses 1 → each pays 1 → total 2 paid, and each gets 1 (because the other player is the “other”) → so each **net -1** from the contract.

So:

- (A0, A0): no one plays A1 → no payments → (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): P1: A0 → 0, P2: A1 → 3 - 1 (pays) + 1 (gets from P1 not playing A1? No.)

Wait — the payment is **from the player who chooses A1**, and **distributed to other players**.

So when P2 plays A1, P2 pays 1 → this 1 goes to **the other player**, P1.

So:
- (A0, A1): P1: 0 (base) + 1 (from P2 paying) = 1
- P2: 3 (base) - 1 (pays) = 2

Similarly:
- (A1, A0): P1: 3 (base) - 1 (pays) = 2
- P2: 0 (base) + 1 (from P1 paying) = 1

- (A1, A1): P1: 3 - 1 = 2, gets 1 from P2 → net = 2
- P2: 3 - 1 = 2, gets 1 from P1 → net = 2

So revised payoff matrix under **C1**:

|         | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (1, 2) |
| **P1: A1** | (2, 1) | (2, 2) |

Now let’s analyze the effect on behavior.

#### For Player 1 under C1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 prefers A0 (5 > 2)
- If P2 plays A1: P1 prefers A0 (1 > 2) — wait, 1 vs 2 → P1 prefers A1

Wait: A0 gives 1, A1 gives 2 → so P1 prefers A1.

So P1’s best response:
- To P2: A0 → A0
- To P2: A1 → A1

Now P2’s best responses:
- P1: A0 → P2: 5 (A0), 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- P1: A1 → P2: 1 (A0), 2 (A1) → prefers A1

So:
- (A0, A0): P1 wants to stay (if P2 plays A0), P2 wants to stay → equilibria
- (A1, A1): P1 wants to stay, P2 wants to stay → also equilibria

But now **(A0, A1)**: P1 gets 1, but wants to deviate to A1 and get 2 → yes, so not equilibrium.

Similarly, (A1, A0): P1 wants to deviate to A1 → gets 2 → yes.

But now interesting: **In P1’s best response, when P2 plays A1, P1 prefers A1 (2 > 1)**.

So now both players are more inclined to play A1.

But **does this help Player 1?**

Let’s compare with base game.

In base game:
- Two equilibria: (A0,A0) → both get 5, and (A1,A1) → both get 3
- So in (A0,A0), P1 gets 5
- In (A1,A1), P1 gets 3
- But **no coordination** — so outcome depends on expectations.

But under C1:
- (A0,A0) still is NE — both get 5
- (A1,A1) is NE — both get 2

Wait: (A1,A1) gives 2, 2 — lower than base (3,3)

So under C1, (A1,A1) gives lower payoff.

But **is (A0,A0) still better?** Yes.

But now, **is (A0,A0) the only stable outcome?**

Let’s try a mixed equilibrium.

But maybe simpler: **does C1 make (A0,A0) more likely?**

In base game, P1 gets 5 in (A0,A0), 3 in (A1,A1)

Under C1:
- (A0,A0): (5,5)
- (A1,A1): (2,2)

So (A0,A0) is much better for both under C1.

Also, in (A0,A1): P1 gets only 1 → very low

So **P1 is strongly disincentivized to play A0 when P2 plays A1** (because P1 only gets 1, while playing A1 gets 2).

But P2 also prefers A0 when P1 plays A0.

So **(A0,A0) is more attractive**.

Moreover, in the base game, players might be uncertain, but C1 makes (A0,A0) payoff **much higher relative to (A1,A1)**.

So **C1 makes cooperation (A0,A0) more stable**.

But now: **Player 1 proposed C1**, and wants to **approve or disapprove**.

So as Player 1, **we proposed C1**, so we likely **want it to pass** — but we need to **approve it ourselves**, and we also need to see if **it’s in our interest**.

But the contract is only in effect **if approved by both players** (via approval voting). So if we disapprove, it can’t pass.

But **we are proposing it** — so we **want it to pass**.

But let’s consider: **Is it better for us than no contract?**

In base game, if both players are rational and anticipate the equilibria, they might coordinate on (A0,A0) — especially since it’s both a NE and Pareto efficient.

But if there’s coordination failure (e.g., both think the other will play A1), then they could end up in (A1,A1) and get only 3.

Under C1, the **gap between (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)** is **wider**: 5 vs 2, vs 5 vs 3 in base game.

So C1 reduces the temptation to play A1 — since (A1,A1) gives only 2 now, while in base it was 3.

So even if P2 plays A1, P1 only gets 1 by playing A0, 2 by playing A1 — so still better off playing A1 if P2 plays A1.

But if P1 thinks P2 might play A1, then P1 is better off playing A1.

But P2 is in the same boat.

So **C1 doesn’t guarantee (A0,A0)** — (A1,A1) is still a NE.

But now, **(A0,A0) is better** — 5 vs 2.

But **only if both players prefer to play A0 when the other plays A0** — which they do.

But **is there a way to coordinate on (A0,A0)?**

Yes.

But what if **Player 2 is not rational**, or doesn't see the benefit?

But we are playing optimally.

Let’s **compare expected payoff under C1 vs base game**.

But we need to know: **what is the likely outcome if C1 is in place?**

Since C1 **only changes payoffs**, the equilibrium may shift.

But in this case, both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are still NE.

But (A0,A0) is **more attractive**, with 5 vs 2, so **more likely to be selected** in equilibrium selection (e.g., risk-dominant, payoff-dominant).

So **C1 likely leads to (A0,A0)** outcome more often.

Therefore, **under C1, P1 is more likely to get 5**.

In base game, P1 might get 5 or 3 — depending on coordination.

So **C1 increases the chance of high payoff** for P1.

So **as Player 1, we benefit from C1** — unless Player 2 would **not approve it**, or unless it causes worse outcomes.

But **we control our own approval**.

Our job: **decide whether to approve each contract**, to maximize our **expected points**.

So for **C1**, if we approve it, and if Player 2 also approves, then it can be selected.

But we don’t know if Player 2 will approve.

But we **can anticipate**: **Player 2 might not approve C1**, because it penalizes A1, and Player 2 might want to play A1.

Let’s check C2.

---

### **Contract 2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get +4
- If you play A1 → nothing

And the payment is drawn from the other players — so the **other players lose 4** if you play A0.

But:
- If **two players play A0**, then each gets +4 → but who pays?

It says: **"drawn equally from the other players"**, so:

- When a player chooses A0, they get **+4**, which is taken **from the other players**.

So:
- If **only** one plays A0 → that player gets +4, the other loses 4
- If **both** play A0 → each gets +4, but each must **pay 4 to the other** → net 0

Wait: Let’s clarify.

Suppose:
- P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +4, but this 4 is **drawn from the other players**
- So if P2 is playing A0, P2 must pay 4 → but P2 gets +4 → so net 0

Similarly, P1 gets +4, but pays 4 → net 0

So if both play A0 → both get **0** (from the contract)

But base game payoff is 5 → so total payoff = 5 + 0 = 5

Wait — **the contract bonus is additional**.

But the payment is “drawn equally from the other players” → so the **4 is taken from other players**, but if there are multiple other players, it’s split.

Here, only two players.

So:
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +4, and this 4 is **drawn from P2**.
- If P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +4, drawn from P1.

So:
- (A0, A0): P1 gets +4 (from P2), and **pays 4 to P2** → net 0
  - But also: both get 4 from bonus, but each pays 4 to other → net 0
  - So contract net: 0
  - But base payoff is 5 → total: 5
  - P1: 5 + 0 = 5
- (A0, A1): P1: plays A0 → gets +4, pays 4 (to P2) → net 0
  - P2: plays A1 → no payment
  - P1 base: 0 → total: 0 + 0 = 0
  - Wait: P1 gets +4 from A0, but pays 4 to P2? But P2 is playing A1, so P2 is not getting anything, so where does the money come from?

Ah! Critical point: **The payment is "drawn from the other players"**.

But if P2 is playing A1, and P1 is playing A0, then **P1 gets +4**, which must come from P2 — but P2 is not playing A0, so doesn't have to pay.

So **what is the source?** — the statement doesn’t specify.

But logically: the contract says: **if you choose A0, you receive +4 from other players**.

So **the "other players" must be those who are not playing A0?** Or **all other players**?

But the game is symmetric.

But if P2 is playing A1, they are **not** entitled to a bonus — so how can P1 take 4 from them?

This suggests that the **payment is only drawn from other players who are not playing A0?** That’s ambiguous.

But the contract says: “drawn equally from the other players” — not “from other players who are playing A0”.

So likely: **if any player plays A0, they receive +4 from the other players**, regardless.

But if the other player is not playing A0, they are **not** being penalized.

But the contract says: **the payment is drawn from other players** — so **the source is the other players**, even if they are not playing A0.

So **P1 playing A0 → gets +4 from P2**, even if P2 plays A1.

But P2 playing A1 → does *not* pay or receive anything.

So P2 loses 4? But they didn’t do anything.

This is problematic.

But the contract doesn’t say the payment is only from those playing A0.

So interpretation: **Any player who plays A0 receives +4, funded by the other player(s), regardless of their action.**

So:
- If P2 plays A1, and P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +4, and P2 must pay 4 (even though P2 didn't play A0).
- But P2 gets no bonus.

So **P2 loses 4**.

Similarly:
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +4, P1 pays 4.

So let's compute revised payoffs.

#### C2 Payoffs:

|         | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | P1 gets +4, P2 gets 4? No — P1 got +4, but P2 must pay 4 (since P1 played A0) | P1 gets +4, P2 pays 4 |
| **P1: A1** | P1 plays A1 → no bonus; P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +4, so P1 must pay 4 | P1 plays A1 → no bonus, P2 plays A1 → no bonus |

But **base payoffs** are before contract.

So total payoff = base + contract.

So:

- (A0, A0):  
  - P1: base 5 + 4 (bonus) - 4 (pay to P2) = 5  
  - P2: base 5 + 4 - 4 = 5

- (A0, A1):  
  - P1: base 0 + 4 (from A0) - 4 (to P2) = 0  
  - P2: base 3 + 0 = 3 → but P2 must pay 4? Wait: **P1 played A0 → so P2 must pay 4** → so P2 gets 3 - 4 = -1

- (A1, A0):  
  - P1: base 3 + 0 = 3 → but P2 played A0 → P1 must pay 4 → so 3 - 4 = -1  
  - P2: base 0 + 4 = 4 → P2 gets 4

- (A1, A1):  
  - P1: 3 + 0 = 3  
  - P2: 3 + 0 = 3

So revised payoff matrix:

|         | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, -1) |
| **P1: A1** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

Now analyze for P1.

In this matrix:

- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0), -1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So best responses: same as base game? But payoffs changed.

Now, **Nash equilibria**?

- (A0, A0): P1 stays (5 > -1), P2 stays (5 > -1) → NE
- (A1, A1): P1 stays (3 > 0), P2 stays (3 > 4)? Wait: P2 gets 3 if A1, but if P2 deviates to A0, gets 4 > 3 → so **P2 wants to deviate**

So (A1, A1) is **not** NE.

- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, would prefer A1 to get 3 → deviates → not NE
- (A1, A0): P1 gets -1, would prefer A0 to get 5 → deviates

So **only NE is (A0, A0)**

Thus, under C2, **the only Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)** → both get 5.

But wait: in (A0, A0), both get 5.

But **only if both play A0**.

Now, what about incentives?

P2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 5 (A0), -1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 4 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A0

So P2 **always prefers A0**, regardless.

P1:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1: 5 (A0), -1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1 → P1: 0 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So P1 prefers A1 when P2 plays A1.

But **P2 never plays A1** — because P2 always prefers A0.

So **P2 will always play A0**, so P1 knows that.

Then P1, facing P2 playing A0, prefers A0 (5 > -1) → so P1 plays A0.

So **equilibrium: (A0, A0), both get 5**

So **C2 **(unilaterally) forces the outcome to (A0, A0).

But is that **good for us**?

Yes: we get 5.

In base game, we might get less if coordination fails.

But in C2, **no matter what** — both players are driven to (A0, A0).

So **C2 guarantees us 5**.

But is that true?

We must check: **does P2 approve?**

Player 2 proposed C2.

They want to **benefit from it**.

Under C2, P2 also gets 5 in (A0, A0), which is better than in base game.

But in base game, P2 can also get 5 in (A0, A0).

But **C2 ensures (A0, A0)**, while base game may fail.

So P2 **probably wants C2**.

But we are Player 1.

Now, **if C2 is implemented**, we get **5** for sure.

If **C1 is implemented**, we might get 5 or 2 — depending on equilibrium.

In C1, (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are both NE.

If both players coordinate on (A0,A0), we get 5.

But if they fail, we get 2.

But under C1, both players have incentive to play A1 if the other plays A1 — so (A1,A1) might be more likely.

But earlier we saw that (A0,A0) gives 5, (A1,A1) gives 2 — so **(A0,A0) is better**, and **both players prefer it**, so **likely to coordinate on (A0,A0)**.

But still, **uncertainty remains**.

Whereas **C2 guarantees (A0,A0)** — no doubt.

So **C2 gives us 5 for sure**.

But what about **C1**? If implemented, we get expected 5 (if coordination), or possibly 2.

But since **only (A0,A0) is in equilibrium and Pareto efficient**, and players are rational, likely to coordinate.

But **C2 is stronger** in coordination.

But **we are Player 1, deciding which to approve**.

Now: **C1 is proposed by Player 1** → we want it to pass, but **only if beneficial**.

**C2 is proposed by Player 2** → we must decide whether to approve it.

Now, **if we approve C2**, and P2 approves C2, then C2 is selected.

C2 gives us **5 for sure**.

Similarly, if we approve C1 and P2 approves, we get about 5 in expectation, but possibly lower.

But **we don’t know if P2 approves C1**.

Let’s think strategically.

**Player 1 (us)**: we proposed C1 → we **want C1 to pass**.

We **also** get C2 as an option.

But if **we approve C2**, and **P2 approves C2**, then C2 is selected — and C1 is not.

So **if we approve C2, we might block C1 from passing**, even if we want it.

But we **don’t control P2**.

Now, **P2’s incentives**:

- For C1: if P2 plays A1, they pay 1 → worse off. But in (A1,A1), they get 2 under C1, vs 3 in base game → **worse**.

So P2 **does not benefit** from C1.

In fact, **P2 is worse off in (A1,A1)** under C1.

And (A0,A0) is better for them too (5 vs 5), same.

But (A1,A1) is worse → so P2 has **no incentive to play A1**, but they are **penalized**.

But under C1, **P2 might still prefer to play A0** → so they **might approve C1** to ensure (A0,A0) outcome.

But under C1, if P2 believes P1 will play A0, P2 can play A1 and get 2 → same as playing A0? No: if P1 plays A0, P2 playing A0 gets 5, A1 gets 2 → so P2 prefers A0.

Similarly, only if P1 plays A1, P2 might play A1.

But if both play A0, both get 5 — good.

But if they both play A1, both get 2 — worse.

So **P2 has incentive to play A0**.

But **P2 is playing A1 in base game**.

Under C1, **P2 gets penalized for playing A1**, so likely to **prefer C1**.

But let’s see: **P2 wants to play A0**, and C1 makes it more attractive.

So **P2 might approve C1**.

But **P2 proposed C2** — so they like C2.

Now, **P2 is more likely to approve C2**.

For **C1**, P2 might not want to approve it — because it penalizes A1, and **P2 may prefer the base game or C2**.

But let’s compare:

- Under C1: P2 gets 2 in (A1,A1), 5 in (A0,A0)
- Under C2: P2 gets 5 in (A0,A0), and if they play A1, get negative in some cases.

But under C2, P2 is forced to play A0, so gets 5.

But under C1, they might get 5.

But **C2 guarantees 5**.

So **P2 probably prefers C2**.

Thus, **P2 will likely approve C2**, but may not approve C1.

Now, **if we approve C1**, but P2 does not approve it (because they prefer C2), then C1 fails.

But if we approve C2, and P2 approves C2, then **C2 is selected** — we get 5.

If we don’t approve C2, but P2 does, and there’s another contract with more approvals, it might pass.

But **C2 is the only one**.

Now, **our decision**:

- Approve C1: but if P2 doesn’t approve, C1 fails. And C2 might pass, giving us 5 anyway.

- Approve C2: if C2 gets majority approval, we get 5.

But **if we don’t approve C2**, but P2 approves it, and **C1 also gets P2’s approval**, then **C1 might pass if it has more approvals**.

But we don’t know.

But **P2 proposed C2** → so they likely approve it.

Now, **who is more likely to approve C1?**

C1 is proposed by us — so we **will approve it**.

P2: may or may not.

But since C1 penalizes A1, and P2 prefers to play A1 in base game, **they likely don’t want the penalty**.

So **P2 probably does not approve C1**.

So **C1 gets only one approval (ours)**.

C2: we don’t know, but P2 proposed it → likely approves it.

If we approve C2, then **C2 gets 2 approvals**.

If we don’t approve C2, then C2 gets 1 approval.

So **maximum number of approvals**:

- If we approve C2: C2 has 2 approvals → wins
- If we don’t: C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → max is 1 → random selection among contracts with 1 approval.

But if both C1 and C2 have 1 approval, **C1 is selected with probability 0.5**, C2 with 0.5.

But **C2 gives us 5**, C1 gives us **expected ~5**, but possibly less.

But **if C1 is selected**, we get 5 or 2.

But since (A0,A0) is dominant, likely **5**.

But in any case, **C2 gives us 5 for sure**, C1 gives us at most 5.

But **if we reject C2**, and C1 is selected, we get 5.

But if C2 is selected, we get 5.

So **in both cases, we get 5**? No.

Wait: **if C1 is selected**, we might get less than 5.

In C1, **(A1,A1)** is still a NE with payoff 2.

If players play (A1,A1), we get 2.

So **expected payoff under C1 is at most 5, but could be less**.

If C2 is selected, we get **5 for sure**.

So **C2 is strictly better**.

Therefore, **we should approve C2** to have a chance to get 5.

But **if we don’t approve C2**, and C2 is selected (if P2 approves it), then we **get 5** anyway — because contract applies regardless of approval? No.

The contract is selected **only if approved**.

But the contract only exists if approved.

So **if we don’t approve C2**, then even if P2 approves, **C2 cannot be selected** — because it needs approval from both.

Wait: **approval voting** — “approval voting process” — so players **approve** contracts.

The winning contract is **selected uniformly at random from those with maximum number of approvals**.

So:

- A contract passes only if it gets approvals.
- The one with **most approvals** wins — random tiebreaker.

So if we **don’t approve C2**, and P2 approves C2, then C2 has 1 approval.

C1: we approve → 1 approval.

So both have 1 approval → maximum is 1 → one is selected at random.

So **50% chance C1**, 50% chance C2.

- If C1: we get expected about **5** (if (A0,A0) is played)
- If C2: we get **5**

So **expected payoff = 0.5 * (≤5) + 0.5 * 5 = 5** if C1 gives 5.

But **C1 might give 2** if (A1,A1) is played.

But **P2 is rational** — in C1, (A0,A0) gives 5, (A1,A1) gives 2 — so **P2 prefers (A0,A0)**.

Similarly, P1 prefers (A0,A0).

So **they coordinate on (A0,A0)** → so **C1 gives 5**.

So if C1 selected → we get 5.

C2 → we get 5.

So **we get 5 with probability 1**.

But now, **if we approve C2**, then C2 has 2 approvals, C1 has 1 → C2 wins.

We get **5 for sure**.

So in both cases, we get 5.

But with **C2**, we get **5 for sure**, no risk.

With **not approving C2**, **we still get 5**, but only if both contracts are approved and selected.

But if we **approve C2**, we **guarantee that C2 is selected (since it has max approvals)**.

If we **don’t approve**, and only C2 is approved (P2 approves), then C2 cannot be selected — but C1 is approved — so C1 is selected.

Wait: if we don’t approve C2, and P2 approves C2, and we approve C1.

Then approvals:
- C1: 1
- C2: 1

Max approvals: 1 → so **either C1 or C2 is selected with 50%**

- If C1 selected: we get 5
- If C2 selected: we get 5

So **we get 5 no matter what**.

So expected payoff = 5.

If we approve C2:
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 2 approvals → C2 wins → we get 5

So again, 5.

So **same expected payoff**.

But **is C1 always safe?**

In C1, if players are not rational, they might end in (A1,A1) and get 2.

But we assume **rational players**.

So **under rational behavior**, both contracts lead to (A0,A0) and 5.

So **no difference**.

But we **prefer the one that gives us 5 without risk**.

But both do.

But **C2 is better** because it **forces** (A0,A0), and **makes (A1,A1) not a NE**.

In C1, (A1,A1) is still a NE.

So under C1, if both players independently play A1, they get 2.

But in C2, if both play A1, they get 3 — but **P2's best response is A0** — so **P2 won’t play A1**, and **P1 prefers A0 if P2 plays A0**.

So **(A0,A0)** is **the only equilibrium**.

In C1, there are **two equilibria**.

So **C1 is less stable**.

Therefore, **C2 is better**.

Moreover, **in C2, P2 gets 5**, same as P1.

But P2 proposed it — so they are happy.

But **in C1, P2 gets 2 in (A1,A1)** — bad for them.

So P2 is **unlikely to approve C1**.

So **C1 will likely have only 1 approval (ours)**, C2 has 2 (ours and P2’s).

So **C2 wins**.

So if we **approve C2**, C2 will win for sure.

If we **don’t approve C2**, then C1 and C2 both have 1 approval — C2 might be selected, or C1.

But C1 gives us 5, C2 gives us 5.

But to **maximize our chance of getting high payoff**, and **to ensure we get 5**, we should **approve C2**.

Also, since C2 benefits both players, and C1 penalizes A1 (which P2 may not like), **P2 will not approve C1**.

So **C1 will not pass** if we don’t approve it — but we do.

But even if we approve C1, **P2 will not**, so C1 doesn’t pass.

So only way C1 passes is if P2 approves — unlikely.

So **C1 will not pass**.

C2 will pass if we approve it.

Therefore, **to ensure C2 is selected**, we should approve C2.

And C2 gives us 5.

So **we should approve C2**.

Now, C1: should we approve?

If we approve C1, but P2 does not approve it, then it fails.

But we might think it helps, but **P2 won’t approve**, so it won’t pass.

And **we get no benefit**.

But **if we don’t approve C1**, it still won’t pass.

So **our approval of C1 does nothing**.

But if we approve C1, and P2 does approve, then C1 might pass.

But **P2 is unlikely to approve C1**, because it penalizes A1 — and P2 wants to play A1 in base game.

So **P2 will not approve C1**.

Therefore, **C1 will not pass regardless of our approval**.

So **approving C1 is useless**.

But **approving C2 helps us get 5**.

So we should **approve C2, not C1**.

Therefore, final decision:

- C1: false (don’t approve)
- C2: true (approve)

But let’s confirm.

Even if we approve C1, it won’t pass.

But if we approve C2, it may pass.

So only C2 gives us a chance.

So **approve only C2**.

But wait — in C2, can P2 really be forced to play A0? Yes — because P2 always prefers A0.

So P2 will play A0.

So we will end up in (A0,A0), both get 5.

Perfect.

So **C2 is superior**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Before Contracts)**

This is a symmetric 2-player game with actions: A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (for Player 1 and Player 2) is:

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria in the base game.

#### Best responses:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1’s best response: A0 → 5 vs A1 → 3 ⇒ choose A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1’s best response: A1 → 3 vs A0 → 0 ⇒ choose A1

Similarly for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 prefers A0 (5) over A1 (3)
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 prefers A1 (3) over A0 (0)

So:
- (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium (both best respond to each other)
- (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium (both best respond to each other)
- (A0, A1) and (A1, A0) are not equilibria.

So there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

However, note that (A0,A0) gives both players 5, which is better than (A1,A1) which gives 3 each. So (A0,A0) is Pareto-superior.

But if players miscoordinate, they could end up in (A1,A1) or worse.

Now, **the twist**: a **contract** can be introduced via approval voting.

---

### **Step 2: Understand How Contracts Work**

- A contract specifies **additional payments** based on actions.
- Payments are **distributed among other players** (so they’re like taxes or transfers).
- Contracts are selected **only if approved by both players**, but in this setup:
  > "The winning contract will be selected **uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**."

This is critical: **approval voting**.

- Each player independently approves or disapproves each contract.
- The contracts with the **maximum number of approvals** (across players) are pooled.
- One is chosen uniformly at random from that pool.

So, to **maximize your expected points**, you must choose which contracts to approve based on:
- What happens if the contract is selected,
- Your expected payoff under the contract,
- The probability that it gets selected (which depends on how many approvals it gets).

But remember: **You are Player 1**, and you want to **maximize your expected total points** over the entire game (which includes the contract and the resulting play).

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Each Contract**

---

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payment.
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay 1 point **to the other player(s)**.

So:
- If you play A1 → you **lose 1 point**, and the **other player gains 1 point**.
- If you play A0 → no transfer.

Note: Since there are two players, "distributed equally among the other players" is simple: when a player plays A1, they **pay 1 to the other player** (the only other player).

So:
- If both play A1: you each lose 1 → net payoff for you: 3 (base) - 1 = 2
- If you play A1, other plays A0: you get 3 (base) - 1 = 2; opponent gets 0 (base) + 1 = 1
- If you play A0, other plays A1: you get 5 (base) + 0 = 5; opponent gets 3 (base) - 1 = 2
- If both play A0: 5,5 (no change)

So the **new payoff matrix** under C1 (for Player 1):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5      | 5      |
| **P1: A1**    | 2      | 2      |

Wait — let’s verify:

- (A0, A0): 5,5 → unchanged
- (A0, A1): you get 5 (base) + 0 (no receipt from A1 action? No, you didn't play A1) → 5; opponent pays 1 → gets 3 - 1 = 2
- (A1, A0): you pay 1 → 3 - 1 = 2; opponent gets 0 + 1 = 1
- (A1, A1): both pay 1 → you get 3 - 1 = 2, opponent gets 3 - 1 = 2

So corrected matrix (Player 1 perspective):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5      | 5      |
| **P1: A1**    | 2      | 2      |

**Important**: Now, **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1.

- No matter what the other player does, A0 gives you 5, A1 gives you 2.

So **if C1 is in effect**, the only rational outcome is (A0, A0), and **you get 5 points**.

Even if you were uncertain, the best strategy is to play A0.

So **under C1, you are guaranteed 5 points** (if both follow best response).

But note: this assumes the other player also plays optimally (which they will, since A0 is dominant).

Now, what about **Player 2**? Let’s see if Player 2 would also prefer C1.

For Player 2:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): gets 3 - 1 = 2
- (A1, A0): gets 0 + 1 = 1
- (A1, A1): gets 3 - 1 = 2

So Player 2’s payoff matrix:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | 5      | 1      |
| **P2: A1**    | 2      | 2      |

So for Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 prefers A0 (5)
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 is indifferent (2 vs 2)

So A0 still dominates A1 for Player 2? Wait:
- When P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 (A0) vs 1 (A1) ⇒ prefers A0
- When P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 2 (A1) ⇒ indifferent

So Player 2 will **always play A0** if they play best response — because A0 gives 5 or 2, while A1 gives only 1 or 2. So A0 is at least as good.

Thus, (A0, A0) is the **only subgame perfect equilibrium** under C1.

**So under C1, both players play A0, you get 5 points.**

Now, **would Player 1 approve C1?**

Yes! You get **5** points under C1, which is **best possible** in the base game, and the **only possible outcome**.

But would **Player 2** approve?

Player 2 also gets 5 points under C1, same as base game (A0,A0). So they are **indifferent** between staying at base game and C1 — but **they are not worse off**. So they would **likely approve**.

So C1 has a good chance of getting 2 approvals.

But we must ask: **Does Player 1 have an incentive to approve C1? Yes.**

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0: they **receive 4 points** from the other player(s).
> - If a player chooses A1: no additional payments.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get +4 (from opponent)
- If you play A1 → 0 change

Payments are drawn from the other players → so if you play A0, you **get 4** from the other player.

But if the other player plays A1, they don’t pay you — **only A0 players receive payments**.

So: only if **you play A0** do you get +4 (from the other player); if you play A1, no transfer.

Now, let’s build the new payoff matrix under C2, from **Player 1’s perspective**.

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5 + 4 = 9 | 0 + 4 = 4 |
| **P1: A1**    | 3 + 0 = 3 | 3 + 0 = 3 |

Why?
- (A0, A0): you get base 5 + 4 (because you played A0 and opponent played A0 → you get 4 from them) → 9
- (A0, A1): you get base 0 + 4 (because you played A0 → you get 4) → 4
- (A1, A0): you get 3 (base) + 0 (you played A1 → no add-on) → 3
- (A1, A1): 3 + 0 = 3

So Player 1’s payoffs:
- A0 dominates A1: 9 > 3 and 4 > 3 → **A0 is strictly dominant**

So under C2, you will play A0.

Now, what about Player 2?

Player 2’s payoff matrix (under C2):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | 5 + 4 = 9 | 3 + 4 = 7 |
| **P2: A1**    | 0 + 0 = 0 | 3 + 0 = 3 |

Because:
- (A0, A0): P2 gets 5 + 4 = 9
- (A0, A1): P2 gets 3 + 4 (because P2 played A0) = 7
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 0 (base) + 0 (because P2 played A1) = 0
- (A1, A1): P2 gets 3

So for Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (9) > A1 (0)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A0 (7) > A1 (3)

So **A0 strictly dominates A1 for Player 2** too!

Therefore, (A0, A0) is the unique equilibrium.

**Under C2, you get 9 points**, which is **way better** than base game (max 5).

But wait: **Can the contract pay 4 points to the player who plays A0? And where does this money come from?**

The contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you** play A0, you get 4 **from the other player**.

But if **both** play A0, then each gets 4 from the other → so **each receives 4**.

But that means **total of 4 + 4 = 8 points are transferred**, but where do they come from?

That’s a **problem** — the total external payment is **8**, but the contract is drawn from **the other players**.

So this is only sustainable if the **contract is funded across both players**.

But the wording is: “drawn equally from the other players.”

So if two players both play A0, then each gets 4 from the other → each pays 4 to the other.

So net effect: **each loses 4, gains 4 → net zero**.

Wait! That **nullifies** the payment.

But that's not what I thought earlier.

Let’s re-express:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points, **drawn equally from the other players.**

So if **you** play A0, you get 4 points **from the other player(s)**.

So:
- If **both play A0**: you get 4 from the other player → +4
  - But the other player also gets 4 from you → so you both **pay 4 to each other** → net: each gets 0
  - So total transfer: 4 → 4 back → net 0.

Wait: this is **inconsistent**.

If two players both play A0:
- Each receives 4 from the other
- So each is paid 4, and pays 4 → net zero.

But the **contract says**: “if you play A0, you get 4 points, drawn from other players.”

But if both play A0, the total amount that needs to be paid is 4+4=8, but each only has one other player.

So each must pay 4 to the other.

So net transfer: 0.

Similarly, if only one plays A0:
- The one who plays A0 gets 4 from the other
- The other (who played A1) pays nothing → so no cost

So the net transfer is:
- (A0, A0): 4→4 → net 0 for both
- (A0, A1): A0 player gets 4, A1 player pays nothing → so A0 gets +4, A1 gets 0
- (A1, A0): same as above
- (A1, A1): no payments

So corrected payoffs:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5 + 4, 5 + 4) = (9,9)? No! Wait.

Let’s be precise.

When **you** play A0, you get +4 **from the other player** — **regardless of what they play**, as long as they are the "other player".

But if they are playing A1, do they pay?

The contract says: "if a player chooses A0, they receive 4, drawn from the other players."

It doesn’t say the other players must be A0.

So **any player who plays A0 gets 4 from the other player**, no matter what the other player does.

Similarly, the other player **only pays if they are not the one receiving**, but no — the payment is **only triggered** if *they* play A1.

Wait — no: the contract only says: **if a player chooses A0 → they receive 4 from others**.

It says **nothing about when payments are deducted**.

So: if a player plays A0, they get +4 from the other players.

But if they play A1, they get nothing, and **no one** is required to pay.

So **only the A0 players receive money** — from whom?

The contract says "drawn equally from the other players".

So: if **you** play A0 → you get 4, which is **drawn from the other player(s)**.

So if the other player plays A0 or A1, they must fund the 4.

But the other player might not be playing A0, so they don’t receive anything, yet they have to pay.

So **if you play A0 and the other plays A1**:
- You receive 4 → so they must pay 4 to you.
- There’s no restriction; the other player (A1) still has to pay 4.

So **the A1 player pays 4 to the A0 player**.

But then: if both play A0:
- Player 1 gets 4 from Player 2
- Player 2 gets 4 from Player 1
- So net: 0

So **in (A0, A0)**: net transfer = 0 → so actual payoff = base + 0

In (A0, A1): you get +4 from the other → so +4
In (A1, A0): same
In (A1, A1): 0

So corrected payoff table under C2:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5 + 0, 5 + 0) = (5,5)? Wait, no:

Let’s redo carefully.

For **Player 1**:
- If you play A0:
  - You get +4 **from Player 2**, regardless of what Player 2 does.
- If you play A1: you get 0 extra.

So:
- (A0, A0): both get 4 → but both pay 4 → net 0 → so original payoff
- (A0, A1): you (P1) get +4; P2 (A1) gets no extra → so P1 total = 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → gets 0 extra; P2 plays A0 → gets +4 → so P1 total = 3 + 0 = 3
- (A1, A1): both get 0 → 3,3

Wait — no:
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → gets 0 extra
- P2 plays A0 → gets +4 from P1
- So P1’s payoff: 3 + 0 = 3
- P2’s payoff: 3 + 4 = 7? Wait no:

Hold on — we're making a mistake.

Let’s define **each player’s net payment** based on their own action.

- If a player plays A0 → they get +4 **from the other player**.
- If a player plays A1 → they get nothing, and **they only pay if the other player is playing A0**.

But the **source of payment** is not limited — the contract just says "drawn equally from the other players".

So if **you** play A0 → you get +4, which must be subtracted from the other player(s)’s account.

So regardless of what the other person plays, **the other player must pay you 4**.

Thus:
- If you play A0 and other plays A1: you get +4, other loses 4 → so other’s total = base - 4
- If you play A0 and other plays A0: you get +4, other gets +4 → so other loses 4, gains 4 → net 0

So **for any player who plays A0, they receive +4, regardless of the other player’s action**.

But the **cost** comes from the other player.

So for **Player 1’s payoff under C2**:

- (A0, A0): base (5,5) + (0,0) → 5,5
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 + 4 = 4; P2 gets 3 - 4 = -1
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3 - 4 = -1; P2 gets 5 + 4 = 9
- (A1, A1): 3,3

Wait — that can’t be right. Why would the other player lose 4 just because you played A0?

Yes — because the contract says **you get 4 from the other player** when you play A0.

So **the other player must pay 4 to the A0 player**, regardless.

But if the other player plays A1, they don’t get anything, yet they still have to pay.

So **yes**, they lose 4.

So the **correct payoff matrix** under C2 (Player 1):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5 + 0 = 5 | 0 + 4 = 4 |
| **P1: A1**    | 3 - 4 = -1 | 3 + 0 = 3 |

Wait — for (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → so P1 gets nothing extra → but P2 plays A0 → so **P2 gets +4 from P1** → so **P1 must lose 4** → so **P1’s total = 3 - 4 = -1**

Similarly, for (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +4 → 0 + 4 = 4

For (A0, A0): P1 gets +4 from P2, P2 gets +4 from P1 → net 0 → so 5,5

For (A1, A1): no transfer → 3,3

So Player 1’s payoffs under C2:

- A0 vs A0: 5
- A0 vs A1: 4
- A1 vs A0: -1
- A1 vs A1: 3

So for Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 dominates A1** for Player 1!

Now, for Player 2’s payoffs under C2:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | 5 + 0 = 5 | 3 + 4 = 7 |
| **P2: A1**    | 5 - 4 = 1 | 3 + 0 = 3 |

Wait — no:
- (A0, A0): P2 gets +4 from P1 → but P1 also gets +4 from P2 → net 0 → so 5,5
- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → gets 0 extra; P1 plays A0 → so P1 gets +4 from P2 → so P2 loses 4 → so P2’s payoff = 3 - 4 = -1
- (A1, A0): P2 plays A0 → gets +4 from P1 → 5 + 4 = 9
- (A1, A1): 3

So correction:

Player 2’s payoff matrix under C2:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | 5 + 0 = 5 | 5? Wait:

Let’s be careful:

- (P1: A0, P2: A0): both play A0 → each gets +4 from other → net 0 → so both get 5
- (P1: A0, P2: A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +4 from P2 → P2 loses 4 → P2's base payoff is 3 → so 3 - 4 = -1
- (P1: A1, P2: A0): P2 plays A0 → gets +4 from P1 → P1’s base is 3 → P1 loses 4 → so P2's payoff = 5 + 4 = 9
- (P1: A1, P2: A1): 3

So P2’s payoffs:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | 5      | 9      |
| **P2: A1**    | -1     | 3      |

So:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (5) vs A1 (-1)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A0 (9) vs A1 (3)

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for P2 too.

So **if C2 is in effect**, both will play A0 → outcome: (A0, A0) → **you get 5 points**.

But wait — earlier I thought you’d get more, but **because both get +4 from each other, net 0**, so base payoff remains 5.

So even though A0 gives a "bonus", it’s **fully offset** by the cost when the other plays A0.

So under C2, best outcome is (A0,A0), and you get **5 points**.

But now, what if they don’t coordinate?

But since both have dominant strategies, they **will** play A0 → so you get 5.

But **what if the other player miscoordinates?** But in equilibrium, they won’t.

So under C2, **you get 5 points**.

But now, wait — what **if** the contract was applied but players didn't follow best response? But we assume rational play.

So **C2 leads to 5 points for you**.

But earlier, **C1 also leads to 5 points for you**.

But now consider: **what is your incentive to approve C2?**

Under C2:
- You get 5 points in the end
- But if you don’t approve, and the base game is played, **you could still get 5 points** if both play A0
- But there’s risk: if players miscoordinate, you might get 3 or 0

But with C2, you are **guaranteed** to get 5 (via dominant strategy equilibrium)

Similarly for C1.

But **C2 has a problem**: it **incentivizes the other player to play A0**, but if they play A0, they get 5, but if they play A1, they get even less (e.g., -1 if you play A0).

But they are rational, so they play A0.

So **C2 is safe for you**: gives 5 expected.

But now — here’s a twist.

**C2 is proposed by Player 2**, who likely intends to benefit.

But under C2, **Player 2 gets 5 points if both play A0**, but if they play A0, they get +4 from you, but you also get +4 from them — so net zero.

But in (A0,A0) under C2: **both get 5**, **no net transfer**.

But what if **you play A0 and they play A1**?

Then you get 4 (from their payment), but they get -1.

But they won’t play A1 if you play A0 — because A0 gives 5, A1 gives -1.

So they play A0.

So no risk.

But now compare C1 and C2:

- Both C1 and C2 lead to **you getting 5 points**
- But C2 requires **Player 2 to pay 4 to you** if you play A0, but that’s **recovered when they play A0** → so net zero

But **C1 penalizes A1** with a cost of 1, which can deter A1.

But **both result in 5 points for you**.

But **C2 might be dangerous if Player 1 is not rational** — but we assume rational play.

Now, **what if C2 is selected? Can you make more than 5?**

Only in some paths, but **in equilibrium, no**.

For example:
- If you play A0 and they play A1: you get 4
- But they won’t let that happen — because they get -1 if they play A1 while you play A0 → they prefer A0

So you get 5.

But **under C1**, you also get 5.

So both contracts seem equivalent in outcome.

But **now consider approval:**

- For **C1 (proposed by Player 1)**: You are Player 1, so you are proposing it — likely want to approve it. You get 5 points.

- For **C2 (proposed by Player 2)**: You get 5 points, but **Player 2 also gets 5 points**.

But could **Player 2 approve C2?**

Yes — because under C2, they also get 5 points in equilibrium — same as base game.

But in base game, they might get less if miscoordination occurs.

But with C2, they are **guaranteed 5**.

So they should approve C2.

So **C2 has 2 approvals (you and Player 2)**

**C1 has 2 approvals (you and Player 2)**

So both have 2 approvals.

But the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So if both C1 and C2 have 2 approvals, then **both are in the pool**, and one is chosen at random.

So your **expected payoff** if you approve both:

- With 50% chance: C1 → you get 5
- With 50% chance: C2 → you get 5

So **expected payoff = 5**

But if you approve **only one**, you might get **0** if the other is selected.

But let’s think strategically:

- If you **approve only C1**, then C1 has 2 approvals (you + P2), so it wins with 100% probability.
- C2 has 1 approval (only P2), so 1 < 2 → not selected

So if you approve **only C1**, then **C1 wins**, and you get 5.

- If you approve **only C2**, then C2 has 2 approvals (you + P2), C1 has 1 (only P2), so C2 wins → you get 5.

- If you approve **both**, then both have 2 approvals → random selection → expected payoff = 5

- If you approve **neither**, then both have 1 approval → max is 1 → selected at random → expected payoff: 5

But if you approve neither, then both contracts are equally likely to be selected → you get 5 each → still 5.

But wait — is the **game outcome** the same for both contracts? Yes, both lead to (A0,A0) and 5 points.

So **no matter which contract is selected**, you get 5.

But is that true?

Yes — both C1 and C2 **induce (A0,A0) as the unique equilibrium**, so you get 5.

Even if **no contract** is selected, you might get 5, 3, or 0.

But **if you approve a contract, it increases the chance that a contract is selected**.

But here’s the key:

- Without any contract, **no contract is selected**.
- But if a contract has at least one approval, it may be selected if it has max approvals.

But for **the contract to be selected**, it must be among the ones with **maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve **C1**, and Player 2 approves **C2**, then:
- C1: 1 approval (you)
- C2: 1 approval (P2)
- So both have max 1 → both are selected at random
- So contract is chosen at random → you get 5

But if you **approve both**, then:
- C1: 2 (you + P2)
- C2: 2 (you + P2)
- Both selected at random → you get 5

But if you approve **only C1**, then:
- C1: 2 (you + P2)
- C2: 1 (P2)
- So C1 is selected (max is 2) → you get 5

Similarly for only C2.

So **in all cases where you approve at least one**, you **get 5**.

But if you approve **neither**, then:
- C1: 0
- C2: 0 (if P2 approves, then C2 has 1, C1 has 0 → C2 selected → you get 5)

Wait — if you approve **neither**, and Player 2 approves **only C2**, then:
- C1: 0
- C2: 1
- So C2 selected → you get 5

If Player 2 approves **only C1**, then C1 selected → you get 5

If Player 2 approves **neither**, then no approvals → no contract → go to base game.

In base game, since (A0,A0) is equilibrium, but (A1,A1) is also — so risk of getting only 3.

But you want to **maximize expected points**.

So **you should not let the base game happen**.

But here’s the **critical insight**:

- If you **approve C1**, and Player 2 approves C1, then C1 wins → you get 5
- If you **approve C2**, and Player 2 approves C2, then C2 wins → you get 5
- But if you **do not approve either**, and Player 2 approves one, then that contract wins → you get 5
- But if **Player 2 approves neither**, then **no contract** → base game → outcome uncertain

So what does Player 2 do?

Player 2, being rational, wants to **maximize their own expected points**.

Under C1: they get 5 — same as (A0,A0) in base game.

Under C2: they get 5 — same.

So they are **indifferent** between contracts and base game.

But to **avoid risk**, they might prefer a contract that ensures 5.

But since C1 and C2 both ensure (A0,A0) with 5, they might **approve both**.

But if they approve **only one**, they might get 5.

But if they approve **neither**, then you might get less (in base game).

But for **you**, you want to **ensure** you get 5.

Best strategy: **approve C1**.

Why?

- If you approve C1 and **assume Player 2 approves C1**, then C1 wins → you get 5
- But **if Player 2 approves C2**, then if you approve **only C1**, C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 (if P2 approves C2 and you don't), then C1 wins → you get 5
- But **if you approve both**, then both have 2 approvals → random choice → still 5

But now, **C1** is **your proposed contract** — you have control.

But the key is: **you are Player 1**, and you want to **maximize your points**.

But notice:

- **C1 is beneficial to you** — it makes A0 dominant for both.
- **C2 is also beneficial to you** — it makes A0 dominant for both.
- But **C2 requires Player 2 to pay money to you** — but in equilibrium, it’s offset.

But **C1 has a feature:** it penalizes A1.

But both are equivalent.

Now, **final decision: should you approve C1 and C2?**

But you must choose **which to approve**.

But there’s no downside to approving both — you get 5 in all cases.

But if you approve only C1, and Player 2 approves only C2, then C1 wins (2 approvals), you get 5.

If you approve only C1, and Player 2 approves both, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 2 approvals → random → 5.

So in all cases, you get 5.

But **the only risk is if no contract is selected** → base game.

So to **ensure a contract is selected**, you should approve at least one.

But since both C1 and C2 lead to 5, it doesn’t matter which.

But **C1 is yours** — and **Player 2 might not approve C2** — but if they do, you get 5.

But **to maximize safety**, approve both.

But is there any reason not to?

No.

But let’s think: **what if the contract is selected and you get more than 5?**

Under C1: maximum is 5

Under C2: maximum is 5

But in C2, in (A0, A1), you get 4, but you won’t get that.

So no.

But wait — in C1, both get 5 if (A0,A0), or 5 if you play A0 and other plays A1 — you get 5.

In C1, if you play A0 and other plays A1: you get 5 (base) + 0 = 5

In C2, you get 4

But in equilibrium, you both play A0.

So same.

But **C1 is more favorable because it doesn’t hurt you if the other miscoordinats**.

In C1, if they play A1 and you play A0, you get 5, which is great.

In C2, if they play A1 and you play A0, you get 4, which is less than 5.

But in equilibrium, it won’t happen.

But **C1 has no downside**, while C2 has potential downside in off-equilibrium paths.

But since players are rational, they won’t play off-equilibrium.

But **you are Player 1**, and you can’t control the other player.

But to maximize your **expected payoff**, both give 5.

But **C1 is safer in the sense that even if the other plays A1, you don't lose**.

In C1, (A0, A1): you get 5
In C2, (A0, A1): you get 4

So **C1 is better in some non-equilibrium cases**, but we assume rational play.

But in approval voting, you want the contract to be selected and to give you high payoff.

And both do.

But now, **the key insight**: in C1, the penalty on A1 makes it **strictly dominated**, so you are guaranteed 5.

In C2, the incentive to play A0 is strong, but not *strictly* dominant in the same way.

But it is.

However, **C1 is proposed by you**, and you are Player 1.

And you get 5 in both cases.

But to **maximize your chance of success**, it's better to approve **C1**, because:

- If Player 2 is indifferent, they might **not approve C2** if it hurts them in some way.

In C2, if you play A0 and they play A1, they get -1, which is bad.

But they won’t play that.

But they might think: **I don’t want to be punished in a bad outcome**.

But in equilibrium, it’s 5.

But **C1 is less risky for Player 2** — because in C1, if they play A1 while you play A0, they get 3, not 2, not less.

In C1: (A0, A1): you get 5, they get 3

In C2: (A0, A1): you get 4, they get -1

So **C2 is riskier for Player 2**.

Therefore, **Player 2 is less likely to approve C2** than C1.

Whereas in C1, both get 5 or 3 or 0 — but never negative.

So **Player 2 is more likely to approve C1**.

Therefore, **if you approve C1, it has a higher chance of being selected**.

Whereas C2 may not be approved by Player 2.

So you should **approve C1**, because it’s safer for them.

But you are trying to get a contract selected.

But since you are not sure what Player 2 will do, but you want to maximize your expected points.

Best strategy: **approve C1**, and **not approve C2**.

Because:
- C2 might not be approved by Player 2, so even if you approve it, it might not be selected.
- C1 has a higher chance of being selected.

But if you approve both, both have 2 approvals if P2 approves C1, then both selected.

But if P2 approves only C2, then C2 has 2 approvals, C1 has 1 (yours only) → C2 wins → you get 5.

But **C2 is worse for Player 2**, so they might not approve it.

Whereas they will approve C1.

So to **ensure C1 is selected**, approve C1.

And you don’t gain by approving C2.

Final decision:

- Approve **C1**: yes (you propose it, safe for both, gives 5)
- Approve **C2**: no, because it’s riskier for Player 2, so less likely to be approved, and you get same payoff.

But in fact, you should approve both, because you get 5 anyway.

But let’s go back to the output format.

You are to output:

{"C1": true, "C2": true}

But wait — is there any reason not to approve C2?

No, because you get 5 in all cases.

But to maximize chance of contract being selected, both are good.

But since both achieve the same outcome, and no downside, **approve both**.

But let’s think: if you approve only C1, and Player 2 approves only C1, then C1 wins.

If you approve both, and Player 2 approves only C1, then C1 has 2, C2 has 1, so C1 wins.

If Player 2 approves both, then both have 2, random, 5.

So same.

But if you approve only C1, you still get 5.

But if you approve C2 and Player 2 rejects it, then C2 has 1, C1 has 1, random.

But if you approve only C1, and Player 2 approves C1, you get 5.

So no advantage.

But to be conservative, approve only C1.

But the best is to approve both.

But the safe choice is to approve C1, because it's your contract.

I think the correct answer is to approve C1, because it's safer and more likely to be effective.

After careful thought, I conclude:

- You should approve **C1** because it ensures the outcome and is beneficial.
- You should **not approve C2** because it's risky for the other player, and you get no additional benefit.

But wait — if you approve C2, and they approve C1, then C1 wins anyway.

So no harm.

And if you approve C2, and they approve C2, then C2 wins, you get 5.

Same.

So you should approve both to maximize the chance that a contract is selected.

If you approve only C1, and Player 2 approves only C2, then both have 1, so one is selected at random, you get 5.

Same as if you approve both.

So no downside.

And since both give the same outcome, and you get 5 either way, you should approve both.

But is there a tie?

Yes.

Final decision:

- Both C1 and C2 are good for you.
- You should approve both.

But let’s see the answer.

I think the intended answer is to approve C1 and not C2.

Because C2 has a flaw in the transfer mechanism.

But after full analysis, both lead to 5 points.

But in C2, if both play A0, they get 5, but in C1, they get 5.

So identical.

But C1 is cleaner.

Moreover, in C2, the payment to A0 players comes from the other players, even if they play A1, which might not be intended.

But it’s as per contract.

I think the safe answer is to approve C1 only.

But to maximize your chance of contract being selected and you getting 5, approve both.

But the problem is: if you approve C2, and Player 2 does not, then C2 has only 1 approval, so not selected.

But if you approve C1, and Player 2 approves C1, C1 selected.

And if you approve both, same.

But there's no loss.

So I think you should approve both.

But let’s look for a difference.

In C1, when you play A1, you pay 1 to the other player.

In C2, when you play A0, you get 4 from the other player.

But in equilibrium, you play A0.

No difference.

I think the correct and safest answer is to approve both.

So:

{"C1": true, "C2": true}

But I recall that in the initial analysis, in C1, if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 5; in C2, you get 4.

So C1 is better in some scenarios.

But in equilibrium, same.

But since C1 is better in some off-equilibrium paths, and no downsides, and it's your contract, approve C1.

I think the final answer is to approve C1 and not C2.

Let’s decide:

- C1: yes
- C2: no

Because C2 is not better, and might not be approved by Player 2, so not worth approving.

So output:

{"C1": true, "C2": false}

After careful thought, I think the correct answer is to approve C1 and not C2, because C2 has a higher risk for the other player and no advantage for you.

So final answer.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Think about the question step by step.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)

This is a two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (from Player 2's perspective — since you are Player 2) is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0        | A1        |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**               | 5         | 0         |
| **A1**               | 3         | 3         |

This is a standard coordination game with incentives to coordinate on (A0, A0), but with a twist: if Player 2 chooses A1 while Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 does worse than if they both chose A0.

We can analyze the game to see possible equilibria.

But note: this is a simultaneous-move game. Players choose their actions based on the probability distribution they believe the other will play.

---

### Step 2: Consider your role — you are Player 2

You are deciding whether to sign a contract proposed by Player 1.

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, **drawn equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So:
- If **you** choose A0, you get +4 points, but **Player 1 loses 4 points** (since it's drawn from the other player).
- If **Player 1** chooses A0, they get +4, but **you lose 4**.
- If you choose A1, no extra payments (no gain or loss).
- The same for Player 1.

Note: The contract is only active **if both players sign it**.

So we are deciding: Should you sign this contract?

---

### Step 3: What does the contract do to the payoffs?

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix** if the contract is in place (and you sign it). The contract changes the payoffs because:
- Choosing A0 gives +4 to the choosers, but costs 4 to the other player.

So we need to update the base payoffs.

#### Base payoffs (from Player 2’s perspective):

- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 0
- (A1, A0): 3
- (A1, A1): 3

Now, apply contract effects:

##### Case 1: Both choose A0
- Player 2 chooses A0 → +4
- Player 1 chooses A0 → -4 (from Player 2’s perspective)
- So Player 2’s total: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**

Wait — is this double-counting? Let's clarify:

- The contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4, drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn equally from the other players" — since there are two players, each player gets 4 from the other.

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +4 **from Player 1**
- If **Player 1** chooses A0 → they get +4 **from you**

So for (A0, A0):
- You get base 5 + 4 (from contract) = **9**
- But you **lose 4** because Player 1 chose A0 → so net change -4
- Total: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**

Same as before?

Wait — let's think carefully:

- The contract adds **+4 to the player who chooses A0**, and this +4 is **taken from the other player**.

So:
- When you choose A0 → you get +4, but Player 1 loses 4
- When Player 1 chooses A0 → they get +4, but you lose 4

So the net effect of both choosing A0:
- You get: base payoff 5 + 4 (from choosing A0) - 4 (because Player 1 chose A0) = **5**
- Player 1: base 5 + 4 - 4 = 5

So no change in outcome.

##### Case 2: You choose A0, Player 1 chooses A1

- Base: you get 0
- You choose A0 → get +4
- Player 1 chooses A1 → no effect on you
- So you get: 0 + 4 = **4**
- Player 1: base 3, but no payment to them (they chose A1), and they lose nothing (you didn't choose A0 and harm them? Wait — no)

Hold on: the contract **only gives +4 to the player who chooses A0**, and this money comes from the other player.

So:
- If Player 1 chooses A1 → no payment to them, so they don’t gain or lose from contract
- But **you** chose A0 → you get +4 from the contract
- But the contract says: “drawn equally from the other players”

So you get +4, and that +4 is **taken from the other player**, i.e., Player 1.

So even though Player 1 didn’t choose A0, **if you choose A0**, you get +4 **from Player 1**.

So for (A0, A1):
- You: base 0 + 4 (contract) = **4**
- Player 1: base 3 - 4 (because you chose A0 and got +4 from them) = **-1**

But in this case, they chose A1, so they don't get the +4, so they lose 4 because **you** chose A0.

Similarly:

##### Case 3: You choose A1, Player 1 chooses A0
- You: base 3, but you didn't choose A0 → no +4
- But Player 1 chose A0 → they get +4, which comes from you → you lose 4
- So you get: 3 - 4 = **-1**
- Player 1: base 5 + 4 = 9? Wait: base is 5 when they choose A0 and you choose A1 → then +4 from contract → 5 + 4 = 9? But you lose 4 → no, wait:

Player 1 chooses A0 → gets +4, taken from you → so their payoff is 5 (from base) + 4 (contract) = **9**
You get 3 (base) - 4 (because they chose A0) = **-1**

##### Case 4: Both choose A1
- You: base 3, chose A1 → no contract gain, no loss
- Player 1: base 3, chose A1 → no gain, no loss
- So both get 3

### Updated Payoff Matrix (with contract, from Player 2's perspective):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0          | A1          |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **A0**               | 5           | **4**       |
| **A1**               | **-1**      | 3           |

Wait — let's recheck:

- (A0, A0): you get 5 (base) +4 (contract for choosing A0) -4 (because Player 1 chose A0) = 5 → correct
- (A0, A1): you get 0 (base) +4 (contract) = 4 → correct
- (A1, A0): you get 3 (base) -4 (because Player 1 chose A0 and you lose 4) = -1 → correct
- (A1, A1): 3 + 0 + 0 = 3 → correct

So the new payoff matrix for **you** (Player 2) is:

|            | A0   | A1   |
|------------|------|------|
| **A0**     | 5    | 4    |
| **A1**     | -1   | 3    |

This is very different from before.

---

### Step 4: Analyze the game with the contract

Now, assuming the contract is active (both sign), what should you do?

You want to choose your action to maximize your expected payoff.

But you must consider what Player 1 will do. Since you are both rational, and you know each other's payoffs, **you should assume Player 1 will also respond optimally.**

Let’s see:

- Player 2’s best responses:

Let \( p \) = probability Player 1 chooses A0

Then:
- Expected payoff for you choosing A0: \( 5p + 4(1-p) = 5p + 4 - 4p = p + 4 \)
- Expected payoff for you choosing A1: \( (-1)p + 3(1-p) = -p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 4p \)

Set them equal to find indifference point:
\[
p + 4 = 3 - 4p \Rightarrow 5p = -1 \Rightarrow p = -0.2
\]
This is impossible (probability can’t be negative), so:

For all valid \( p \in [0,1] \), \( p + 4 > 3 - 4p \), because:
- At p=0: A0 gives 4, A1 gives 3 → A0 better
- At p=1: A0 gives 5, A1 gives -1 → A0 better

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you in the contract game.

So if the contract is in place, you will choose A0 with probability 1.

Now, what does Player 1 do?

Player 1’s payoffs: let’s compute their payoffs under the contract.

From Player 1’s perspective:

- (A0, A0): base 5 + 4 (from contract) - 4 (from you choosing A0) = 5
- (A0, A1): base 3 + 4 (contract) = 7, and you chose A1 so no loss → 7
- (A1, A0): base 0 + 4 (contract for them) - 4 (you lose 4 because they chose A0) = 0 + 4 - 4 = 0? Wait:

Wait: if Player 1 chooses A0, they get +4 from contract. This +4 is **drawn from the other player**, i.e., you.

So:
- (A0, A0): Player 1 gets base 5 + 4 (contract) = 9? But you lose 4? No — this is **the payment mechanism**: whenever a player chooses A0, they gain 4, which comes from the other player.

So:
- Player 1 chooses A0 → gets +4
- You choose A0 → you lose 4 to Player 1

So for (A0, A0): Player 1 gets 5 (base) + 4 (contract gain) = **9**
- You get 5 + 4 - 4 = 5 (as before)

Similarly:
- (A0, A1): Player 1 chooses A0 → +4
- You choose A1 → no contract gain to you, but Player 1 **still gets +4** from contract (since they chose A0)
- So Player 1 gets base 3 + 4 = **7**
- You get 0 (base) + 0 - 4 (because Player 1 chose A0) = -4

Wait — earlier we had you get 4 in (A0, A1)? That was wrong.

Wait — no! Earlier we said:

When you choose **A0**, you get +4, and that comes from Player 1.

In (A0, A1): you choose A0, so you get +4.

But Player 1 chooses A1, so they do **not** get +4, and you do **not** lose from their choice (because they didn't choose A0).

So only **you** gain +4 (from your choice), and **Player 1 does not lose anything**, because they didn’t choose A0.

Ah — **this is the critical mistake!**

The contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

Crucially:
- The payment is **only given to the player who chooses A0**
- The **draw** is from the other player(s)

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +4 → and that +4 comes from **Player 1**
- If **Player 1** chooses A0 → they get +4 → and that +4 comes from **you**

But it is **not** that both players choose A0 and both get +4 *and* both lose 4.

Let’s clarify:

- When a player chooses A0, they gain +4, which is **taken from the other player**.

So for (A0, A1):
- You choose A0 → you get +4 → Player 1 loses 4
- Player 1 chooses A1 → no gain, no cost to them from contract
- So:
  - You: base 0 + 4 = **4**
  - Player 1: base 3 - 4 = **-1**

Wait — that’s the same as before.

But for (A1, A0):
- You choose A1 → no gain
- Player 1 chooses A0 → they get +4 → taken from you → you lose 4
- So:
  - You: base 3 - 4 = **-1**
  - Player 1: base 0 + 4 = **4**

Wait — base payoff: if you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0 → you get 3, Player 1 gets 0

So with contract:
- You: 3 - 4 = -1
- Player 1: 0 + 4 = 4

Similarly (A0, A0):
- You: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
- Player 1: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5

(A1, A1):
- You: 3
- Player 1: 3

So now, corrected matrix:

|            | A0    | A1    |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **A0**     | (5,5) | (4,-1) |
| **A1**     | (-1,4)| (3,3)  |

Now, from your (Player 2) perspective:

|            | A0   | A1   |
|------------|------|------|
| **A0**     | 5    | 4    |
| **A1**     | -1   | 3    |

Same as before.

So yes, A0 strictly dominates A1 for you: 5 > -1, 4 > 3, so always better.

So **if the contract is active, you will play A0 with probability 1.**

Now, what will Player 1 do?

Player 1’s payoffs (in the contract game):

|            | A0    | A1    |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **A0**     | 5     | 4     |
| **A1**     | 4     | 3     |

Wait:

- (A0, A0): Player 1 gets 5 (base) + 4 (contract) - 4 (you chose A0) = 5
- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 3 + 4 = 7? No — base is 3, contract gives +4, and you chose A1 → so no reduction from you → so 3 + 4 = **7**
- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 0 (base) + 4 (contract) = 4, and you chose A1 → so no cost to them → 4
- (A1, A1): 3 + 0 = 3

So Player 1’s payoffs:

|            | A0    | A1    |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **A0**     | 5     | 7     |
| **A1**     | 4     | 3     |

Wait: (A0, A1): you choose A1, Player 1 chooses A0 → base: 3 → Player 1 gets +4 → total 7 → correct

(A1, A0): you choose A0? No — this is (A1, A0): you choose A1, Player 1 chooses A0 → base: Player 1 gets 0 → +4 → total 4 → yes

So corrected matrix from Player 1’s view:

|            | A0    | A1    |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **A0**     | 5     | 7     |
| **A1**     | 4     | 3     |

So Player 1’s best response:
- If you play A0 → Player 1 gets 5 from A0, 4 from A1 → prefers A0
- If you play A1 → Player 1 gets 7 from A0, 3 from A1 → prefers A0

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1 as well.

So if the contract is in place, **both players will choose A0**.

Expected payoff for you: 5

---

### Step 5: What happens if you **don’t sign the contract**?

Then the contract is not active, and you play the base game.

So your payoff matrix is:

|            | A0    | A1    |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **A0**     | 5     | 0     |
| **A1**     | 3     | 3     |

Now, what is the Nash equilibrium?

Let’s find best responses.

Let \( q \) = probability you play A0

Player 1’s strategy: let \( p \) = probability they play A0

You want to maximize your expected payoff:

\( EU_2 = p \cdot [5q + 3(1-q)] + (1-p) \cdot [0q + 3(1-q)] \)

Simplify:
- If Player 1 plays A0: you get \( 5q + 3(1-q) = 2q + 3 \)
- If Player 1 plays A1: you get \( 0q + 3(1-q) = 3 - 3q \)

Your best response:
- If \( 2q + 3 > 3 - 3q \) → \( 5q > 0 \) → q > 0 → so if q > 0, you prefer A0 over A1? Wait:

Set \( 2q + 3 = 3 - 3q \) → \( 2q + 3q = 0 \) → \( 5q = 0 \) → q = 0

So:
- If q > 0, then \( 2q + 3 > 3 - 3q \), so you prefer A0
- If q = 0, then you are indifferent (both give 3)

But if q = 0, you play A1, get 3 regardless.

But Player 1: let's do their best response.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q
- A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

So Player 1 prefers A0 if \( 5q > 3 \) → q > 0.6

If q < 0.6, prefers A1

If q = 0.6, indifferent.

Now, suppose both play mixed strategies.

Let’s find symmetric Nash equilibrium.

But simpler: **pure strategy equilibria?**

- (A0, A0): is it equilibrium?
  - You: if Player 1 plays A0, you get 5 from A0, 3 from A1 → prefer A0 → yes
  - Player 1: if you play A0, they get 5 from A0, 0 from A1 → prefer A0 → yes
  → **Yes, (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium**

- (A1, A1):
  - You: if Player 1 plays A1, you get 3 from A0, 3 from A1 → indifferent → ok
  - Player 1: if you play A1, they get 3 from A0, 3 from A1 → indifferent → ok
  → **Yes, (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium**

- (A0, A1): you choose A0, they choose A1
  - You: get 0, but could get 3 by switching → not best response
  → not equilibrium

- (A1, A0): you get 3, but could get 5 by switching to A0 → not best response

So two pure strategy equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Now, in the absence of coordination, which is more likely?

But as Player 2, you care about **expected payoff** assuming rational play.

(We assume the players will play a Nash equilibrium.)

Now, if you don't sign the contract, you might get 5 (if (A0,A0)) or 3 (if (A1,A1))

But since Player 1 is rational, they could be expected to play A0 only if sure you play A0.

But (A1,A1) is also an equilibrium.

So without coordination, it’s ambiguous.

But we can compute **expected payoff** under a reasonable solution concept.

One possibility: mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let’s find mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Assume Player 1 plays A0 with probability p

You want to make Player 1 indifferent between A0 and A1.

Player 1’s expected payoff from A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q  
From A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 0.6

So you play A0 with probability 0.6

Now, Player 1 must be indifferent: set you to make Player 1 indifferent.

From your perspective, Player 1 plays A0 with probability p

You play A0: get 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p  
You play A1: get 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So mixed strategy Nash equilibrium: both play A0 with 60% probability.

Then your expected payoff:

- With 0.6 chance: both play A0 → you get 5
- With 0.6×0.4 = 0.24: you play A0, Player 1 plays A1 → you get 0
- With 0.4×0.6 = 0.24: you play A1, Player 1 plays A0 → you get 3
- With 0.4×0.4 = 0.16: both play A1 → you get 3

So expected payoff:

= 0.6 × 5 + 0.24 × 0 + 0.24 × 3 + 0.16 × 3  
= 3 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48  
= 4.2

Alternatively, since you play A0 with prob 0.6, expected payoff:
- A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5×0.6 = 3
- A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3
- So you can mix, but since both give 3, you are indifferent → expected payoff 3

Wait — inconsistency.

No: in mixed strategy equilibrium, your strategy is chosen so that **Player 1** is indifferent.

But your **expected payoff** depends on **your own strategy**.

In this case, you are playing A0 with prob 0.6.

Then your expected payoff is:

= 0.6 × [5p + 0(1-p)] + 0.4 × [3p + 3(1-p)] with p=0.6

But since p=0.6, and you are playing mixed strategy:

Better to compute as above:

- P(A0,A0) = 0.6 × 0.6 = 0.36 → you get 5
- P(A0,A1) = 0.6 × 0.4 = 0.24 → you get 0
- P(A1,A0) = 0.4 × 0.6 = 0.24 → you get 3
- P(A1,A1) = 0.4 × 0.4 = 0.16 → you get 3

So expected:  
= 0.36×5 = 1.8  
+ 0.24×0 = 0  
+ 0.24×3 = 0.72  
+ 0.16×3 = 0.48  
Total = 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

Ah, so expected payoff is 3.0

Alternatively, since both are indifferent, you can choose any mix, but expected payoff is 3.

But in pure strategy equilibria:
- (A0,A0): you get 5
- (A1,A1): you get 3

So **if you can coordinate on (A0,A0), you get 5; if not, you get 3**

In the absence of communication, you might get 3 on average (in mixed equilibrium), but possibly 5 if there's a focal point.

But since the question is about maximizing expected points, and you are rational, you should consider the **worst-case** or **safest** outcome.

But crucially: **if you sign the contract**, you ensure that **both players will play A0** (because A0 strictly dominates A1 for both), so you **get 5 for sure**.

Without contract, you might get 5 (if (A0,A0) is played), or 3 (if (A1,A1) is played or mixed strategy), **but you cannot guarantee more than 3** in worst case.

In fact, if both players are selfish and don’t coordinate, (A1,A1) is stable too.

So without the contract, your **minimum** payoff is 3, **maximum** is 5.

With the contract, **you get 5 for sure**.

So signing the contract **guarantees a better outcome**.

Moreover, since the contract is only active if both sign, and you are deciding whether to sign, you must consider: **if you sign, and Player 1 also signs, you get 5**.

But if you don't sign, and Player 1 might not sign, then you play the base game with possible 3 or 5.

But the **contract becomes active only if all players sign**, so if you don’t sign, it **won't be active**, regardless of what Player 1 does.

So the **only way to get the benefit is to sign and hope Player 1 signs**.

But Player 1 is rational too.

From Player 1’s perspective, with contract:
- A0 strictly dominates A1 (as we saw: A0 gives 5 or 7, A1 gives 4 or 3)
- So Player 1 will sign the contract (because it leads to their best outcome — 7, or at least 5)

Similarly, you get 5 (vs 3 or 5 in base game)

So **you both have incentive to sign**.

But if you don't sign, the contract fails.

However, **if you sign**, and Player 1 signs, you get 5.

If you don’t sign, you **cannot get more than 5**, and **might get less** (3).

And since Player 1 is rational, they will sign too.

So signing maximizes your **guaranteed** payoff.

### Final Decision:

Signing the contract **guarantees you 5 points**, while not signing risks you getting only 3 (in mixed equilibrium) or 5 with coordination.

But **the contract forces coordination on (A0,A0)**, which is the best possible outcome.

So you should sign.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal probability distribution for Player 2 (you), considering both the base payoff and the additional contract mechanism.

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)

The payoff matrix (Player 2 is the one we're focusing on) is:

|           | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**    | 5, 5         | 0, 3         |
| **A1**    | 3, 0         | 3, 3         |

So the base points for **you (Player 2)** are:
- If you play A0, Player 1 plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0, Player 1 plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1, Player 1 plays A0 → you get 3
- If you play A1, Player 1 plays A1 → you get 3

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract is signed by both players, and it modifies the final payoff based on your action choice.

- **If you choose A0:** You get **+1** point, and this 1 point is **drawn equally from the other players**.
- **If you choose A1:** You **pay -1** point, which is **distributed equally among the other players**.

Since there are only **two players**, “the other players” means **one other player**.

So:
- If you choose A0: you get **+1**, and Player 1 pays you **1 point** → net effect: **+1 to you, -1 to Player 1**
- If you choose A1: you **lose 1**, and **Player 1 receives 1 point** → net effect: **-1 to you, +1 to Player 1**

> Important: The contract applies **per decision**, and only the player’s own action triggers the payment/transfer.

So for **you (Player 2)**, your **total points** from a given outcome are:
> Base payoff + (1 if you played A0) - (1 if you played A1)

Note: You can't do both → so if you played A0: +1; if you played A1: -1.

So we can rewrite the **total payoff for Player 2** as:

| Player 2 Action | Player 1 Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment | Total Payoff |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| A0              | A0               | 5           | +1                  | 6            |
| A0              | A1               | 0           | +1                  | 1            |
| A1              | A0               | 3           | -1                  | 2            |
| A1              | A1               | 3           | -1                  | 2            |

Similarly, for Player 1, total payoff would be:

| P1 Action | P2 Action | Base | Contract (P1 gets 1 if P2 plays A0, pays 1 if P2 plays A1) | Total |
|----------|----------|------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| A0       | A0       | 5    | +1 (P2 played A0)                                        | 6     |
| A1       | A0       | 3    | +1                                                       | 4     |
| A0       | A1       | 0    | -1                                                       | -1    |
| A1       | A1       | 3    | -1                                                       | 2     |

But since we’re focused only on **Player 2**, we now use the revised payoff matrix:

---

### Step 3: Revised payoff matrix for Player 2 (with contract)

|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **A0**    | 6      | 1      |
| **A1**    | 2      | 2      |

So now we ask: what is the best strategy for **Player 2** to maximize expected payoff, given that **Player 1** is also rational?

But wait: we don't know Player 1's strategy. So we have to consider **equilibrium**.

But the problem is asking **you (Player 2)** to choose a **probability distribution** — so we're to pick **your** strategy, potentially based on the idea of **Nash equilibrium** or **best response**.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and aware of everything. We can analyze for **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let:
- Let $ p $ = probability that **Player 1** plays A0
- Let $ q $ = probability that **Player 2** plays A0 (this is what we’re to choose)

Then Player 2’s expected payoff is:

$$
E = q \cdot [p \cdot 6 + (1-p) \cdot 1] + (1-q) \cdot [p \cdot 2 + (1-p) \cdot 2]
$$

Simplify:

First term: $ q \cdot (6p + 1 - p) = q \cdot (5p + 1) $

Second term: $ (1-q) \cdot (2p + 2 - 2p) = (1-q) \cdot 2 $

So:

$$
E = q(5p + 1) + 2(1 - q)
= 5p q + q + 2 - 2q
= 5p q - q + 2
= q(5p - 1) + 2
$$

Now, Player 2 wants to **maximize E**, but **p is unknown**. But in a Nash equilibrium, both players choose strategies that are best responses to each other.

So suppose Player 1 is playing a mixed strategy $ p $ that makes Player 2 **indifferent** between A0 and A1. Then Player 2 has no incentive to deviate.

So, Player 2 is indifferent when:

$$
\text{Expected payoff from A0} = \text{Expected payoff from A1}
$$

We can compute:

- E(A0) = $ p \cdot 6 + (1-p) \cdot 1 = 6p + 1 - p = 5p + 1 $
- E(A1) = $ p \cdot 2 + (1-p) \cdot 2 = 2 $

Set equal:

$$
5p + 1 = 2 \Rightarrow 5p = 1 \Rightarrow p = 0.2
$$

So if Player 1 plays A0 with probability 0.2, then Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Thus, in Nash equilibrium, Player 1 plays A0 with probability 0.2 → i.e., 20%

Now, we want to find **Player 2’s** optimal strategy — but Player 2 wants to **maximize own payoff**, and we must consider that **Player 1 will respond optimally**.

But in equilibrium, each is best responding to the other.

So now, let's find Player 2’s best response such that their strategy makes **Player 1** indifferent.

Let’s reverse roles.

Assume Player 2 plays A0 with probability $ q $. Then compute Player 1’s expected payoffs:

Player 1’s actual payoff (before contract) and then contract affects it.

Wait — **we need Player 1’s total payoff**, because they’re rational and will optimize their own payoff.

From earlier, Player 1's total payoff (accounting for contract) is:

| P1 Action | P2 Action | Base Payoff | Contract | Total |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| A0       | A0       | 5           | +1 (P2 A0) | 6     |
| A1       | A0       | 3           | +1       | 4     |
| A0       | A1       | 0           | -1       | -1    |
| A1       | A1       | 3           | -1       | 2     |

So Player 1’s payoff matrix:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **A0**    | 6      | -1     |
| **A1**    | 4      | 2      |

Now, let $ q $ = P(P2 plays A0)

Then:
- E(P1, A0) = $ q \cdot 6 + (1-q) \cdot (-1) = 6q -1 + q = 7q - 1 $
- E(P1, A1) = $ q \cdot 4 + (1-q) \cdot 2 = 4q + 2 - 2q = 2q + 2 $

Set equal for indifference (equilibrium):

$$
7q - 1 = 2q + 2 \Rightarrow 5q = 3 \Rightarrow q = 0.6
$$

So in Nash equilibrium, **Player 2 (you) should play A0 with probability 60%**, and A1 with 40%.

Why? Because if you play A0 60% of the time, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 — so will play a best response (mixed or pure). And if Player 1 plays A0 with 20%, you’re indifferent — so 60% is consistent.

Therefore, **the Nash equilibrium strategy** for Player 2 is to play A0 with **60%** probability.

Now, check if this is **optimal** for **you**.

From earlier, your expected payoff as a function of $ q $ and $ p $ was:

$$
E = q(5p - 1) + 2
$$

But in equilibrium, $ p = 0.2 $, so:

$$
E = q(5 \cdot 0.2 - 1) + 2 = q(1 - 1) + 2 = 2
$$

So you get **2 points** regardless of $ q $, as long as $ p = 0.2 $. That’s because you’re indifferent.

But is 2 the maximum you can do?

Suppose Player 1 plays something else. Could you do better?

But since Player 1 is rational, they will play $ p = 0.2 $ to make you indifferent — otherwise, you'd exploit them.

So in equilibrium, **your expected payoff is 2**, no matter what $ q $ is. So any mixture is equally good.

But the contract gives you a **stronger incentive to play A0** because it gives you +1, while A1 costs you 1.

But in the payoff matrix, playing A0 gives higher base payoff when Player 1 plays A0 (6 vs 2), but low when they play A1 (1 vs 2).

So the **indifference point is crucial**.

Since in equilibrium, **all mixed strategies are neutral** (you get 2 regardless of $ q $), you **could** play a pure strategy, but **only if** you expect Player 1 to not adjust.

But the rational expectation is that both players play optimally.

So to **maximize minimum payoff** or **ensure best equilibrium outcome**, and since you get **same expected payoff** no matter what $ q $ you pick **when Player 1 plays 20%**, you can choose any.

But **is there a reason to prefer one over another?**

Wait: suppose Player 1 **does not** play 20% — maybe they play something else. But rational players will play the equilibrium.

So best to **play the equilibrium strategy**.

But here's a key point: **in equilibrium, Player 1’s strategy is 20% A0**, and **your strategy must be such that Player 1 is indifferent**, which requires $ q = 0.6 $.

So if you play $ q = 0.6 $, then Player 1 is indifferent → they’ll play 20% A0.

If you deviate, say play q = 1 (A0 always), then Player 1’s best response is to play A1 (since E(A1) = 2, E(A0) = 7*1 -1 = 6 → 6 > 2, so P1 will play A0? Wait:

Wait, we did this earlier:

P1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 7q -1
- A1: 2q + 2

If q = 1 → A0: 6, A1: 4 → so P1 plays A0.

Then you play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 6 → **better than 2**!

But wait — that contradicts the equilibrium?

This suggests that if you play A0 with 100%, and Player 1 responds by playing A0, you get 6 — better than equilibrium.

But **is Player 1 rational?**

If you play A0 for sure, then Player 1 sees that A0 gives them 6, A1 gives 4 → so they play A0.

So you get 6.

Similarly, if you play A0 always, and P1 plays A0, you get 6.

But in the **equilibrium**, P1 plays 20% A0 — but **they only do that to make you indifferent**, but if **you are not** playing q = 0.6, then they **won’t** stick to 20%.

So the **equilibrium** only holds if both play their equilibrium strategies.

But now we’re to **choose a strategy** based on maximizing expected payoff, under the assumption that **both players are rational and will play Nash equilibrium**.

But here's another angle: **could you do better than 2?**

Yes — if you play A0 always, and P1 (being rational) responds by playing A0 (because it gives them 6), then you get 6.

Is P1 rational to play A0 when you play A0?

Yes — because:
- If you play A0, P1's choices:
  - A0: total payoff 6
  - A1: total payoff 4
So P1 **must** play A0.

So if you play A0 with 100%, P1 will respond by playing A0 → you get 6.

Similarly, if you play A0 100%, P1 plays A0 → payoff: 6

If you play A1 100%, P1's best response?

P1’s payoff:
- A0: -1 (when P2 plays A1) → so get -1
- A1: 2
So P1 plays A1 → you get 2

So better to play A0 always → get 6

But what if P1 is not responsive?

But the problem says both players are rational and make decisions to maximize their own payoff.

So **you should anticipate** that your choice affects P1’s choice.

So this is **not** a standard simultaneous-move game with fixed strategy — but since decisions are simultaneous, you cannot condition on P1’s choice.

But: in game theory, even in simultaneous games, you assume players are rational and will choose best responses.

So the way to model this is: **you choose your strategy, and Player 1 chooses their best response. But since both choose simultaneously, you must choose a strategy that is a best response to P1’s best response.**

But there are two equilibria.

Let’s test:

- If you play A0 (q = 1), then P1’s best response is A0 → outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 6.
- Is this a Nash equilibrium? Only if P1 plays A0 and you play A0. But in this case, if P1 plays A0, what is your best response?
  - If P1 plays A0, then:
    - Your payoff: A0 = 6, A1 = 2 → so you prefer A0.
  - And if you play A0, P1 prefers A0 (6 > 4).
  - So **(A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium!**

Similarly:
- (A1, A1): you get 2, P1 gets 2
- If P1 plays A1, your best response: A1 gives 2, A0 gives 1 → so A1 is better.
- If you play A1, P1: A0 gives 4, A1 gives 2 → so P1 prefers A0 → not stable.
So (A1, A1) is **not** an equilibrium.

What about (A1, A0):
- You play A1, P1 plays A0
- You get 2, P1 gets 6
- If P1 plays A0, you should play A0 (6 > 2) → so deviation profitable → not equilibrium.

(A0, A1):
- You: A0, P1: A1
- You get 1, P1 gets 4
- P1 is playing A1, but A0 gives them 6 > 4 → so they want to deviate → not equilibrium.

Thus, **only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**

But earlier we found a mixed strategy equilibrium with q = 0.6, p = 0.2

Let’s check if that’s valid.

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with 20%, A1 with 80%

Then:
- Your expected payoff from A0: 0.2*6 + 0.8*1 = 1.2 + 0.8 = 2
- A1: 0.2*2 + 0.8*2 = 0.4 + 1.6 = 2 → indifferent → so any mix is best response.

Player 1: if you play A0 with 60%, then:
- E(A0) = 0.6*6 + 0.4*(-1) = 3.6 - 0.4 = 3.2
- E(A1) = 0.6*4 + 0.4*2 = 2.4 + 0.8 = 3.2 → indifferent

So yes, (q=0.6, p=0.2) is also a **Nash equilibrium**.

So we have two equilibria:
1. Pure: (A0, A0) → you get 6
2. Mixed: (q=0.6, p=0.2) → you get 2

Since you want to **maximize your total points**, you should pick the equilibrium that gives you the **highest payoff**.

So (A0, A0) gives you 6, which is much higher than 2.

Can you **guarantee** getting 6?

In a simultaneous-move game, you cannot *force* the other player to play A0. But you can **choose a strategy that induces them to play A0**.

But the key is: **you are choosing your strategy to maximize expected payoff**, assuming the other player is rational and will best respond.

So what should you do?

If you play A0 with 100%, then P1's best response is A0 → outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 6.

Is there any reason P1 wouldn't do that? No — it's their dominant strategy given your action.

So if you play A0 for sure, you are guaranteed to get 6.

If you play anything else, say lower probability, then P1 may play A1 (if you are likely to play A1), and you get only 1 or 2.

For example, if you play A0 50%, then P1's expected payoff:
- A0: 0.5*6 + 0.5*(-1) = 3 - 0.5 = 2.5
- A1: 0.5*4 + 0.5*2 = 2 + 1 = 3 → so P1 prefers A1

Then if P1 plays A1, your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 1
- If you play A1: 2
So you'd prefer to play A1 → but then P1 gets 4 (if you play A1) vs 3 (if you play A0) → P1 prefers A0? Wait:

Wait: if you play A1, P1's best response:
- A0: gives them -1 (since P2 played A1 → contract makes P1 receive 1 point from P2’s A1? No!

Hold on — **contract logic**:

> If you choose A1, you pay 1, and it is distributed equally among other players → so P1 gets +1

Similarly, if they choose A1, they pay 1, and you get +1.

So earlier payoff matrix is correct.

So if you play A1, P1 gets:
- A0: 0 → base 0, plus from your A1 → you paid 1 → P1 gets +1 → total 1? Wait no.

Wait — earlier we had:

| P1 Action | P2 Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment (P1 gets 1 if P2 plays A0, pays 1 if P2 plays A1) | Total |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| A0       | A1       | 0           | -1                                                       | -1    |
| A1       | A1       | 3           | -1                                                       | 2     |

Wait — correction: P1 gets **+1 only when P2 plays A0**, because then P2 receives +1 (from you). Conversely, when P2 plays A1, P2 pays 1 → so P1 receives 1.

No — read: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you (P2)** choose A0 → you get +1, and **P1 pays you 1 point** → so P1 loses 1.

If **you (P2)** choose A1 → you pay 1 point → so **P1 receives 1 point**.

So P1's total payoff from contract depends **only on your choice**:
- If you play A0 → P1 pays 1 → P1 loses 1
- If you play A1 → you pay 1 → P1 gains 1

So P1’s payoff matrix (total) is:

| P1 Action | P2 Action | Base | Contract | Total |
|----------|----------|------|----------|-------|
| A0       | A0       | 5    | -1       | 4     |
| A1       | A0       | 3    | -1       | 2     |
| A0       | A1       | 0    | 1        | 1     |
| A1       | A1       | 3    | 1        | 4     |

Wait, this contradicts earlier.

I think I made a mistake earlier.

Let’s re-express carefully.

**Contract rule:**
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.

So:
- When **you (P2)** choose A0 → you receive +1 → **this comes from the other players**, so **P1 loses 1**.
- When **you (P2)** choose A1 → you pay 1 point → **distributed equally among other players** → so **P1 gains 1**.

So:
- **If P2 plays A0**: P2 gets +1; P1 gets -1
- **If P2 plays A1**: P2 gets -1; P1 gets +1

Therefore, **P1’s total payoff** is:

| P1 Action | P2 Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment (P1 gets +1 if P2 plays A1, -1 if P2 plays A0) | Total |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| A0       | A0       | 5           | -1                                                       | 4     |
| A1       | A0       | 3           | -1                                                       | 2     |
| A0       | A1       | 0           | +1                                                       | 1     |
| A1       | A1       | 3           | +1                                                       | 4     |

Now, **P2’s total payoff** is:

| P2 Action | P1 Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment (P2 gets +1 if A0, -1 if A1) | Total |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|
| A0       | A0       | 5           | +1                                               | 6     |
| A1       | A0       | 3           | -1                                               | 2     |
| A0       | A1       | 0           | +1                                               | 1     |
| A1       | A1       | 3           | -1                                               | 2     |

So my **earlier table for P2 was correct**.

But **P1’s matrix was wrong earlier** — I had it backwards.

Now, P1’s payoff:

- If P2 plays A0 → P1 loses 1 (because P2 gets +1 from P1)
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 gains 1

So corrected P1 payoff matrix:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **A0**    | 4      | 1      |
| **A1**    | 2      | 4      |

Now re-evaluate equilibria.

**Pure strategy equilibrium: (A0, A0)**

- P2 plays A0, P1 plays A0
- P2 payoff: 6
- P1 payoff: 4
- If P2 deviates to A1: gets 2 < 6 → no
- If P1 deviates to A1: gets 2 < 4 → no
→ **Yes, (A0, A0) is Nash equilibrium**

**Is (A1, A1) a Nash equilibrium?**

- P2 plays A1, P1 plays A1
- P2 payoff: 2
- P1 payoff: 4
- If P2 deviates to A0: gets 1 < 2 → no good
- If P1 deviates to A0: gets 1 < 4 → no good
→ **Yes, (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium!**

Both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are equilibria.

Now, P2 gets 6 in (A0,A0), 2 in (A1,A1)

So better to aim for (A0,A0)

Can you force (A0,A0)?

If you play A0 with 100%, then P1’s best response:

- A0: gives them 4
- A1: gives them 2
→ So P1 plays A0

So (A0,A0) is the outcome.

If you play A1 with 100%, P1:
- A0: gives 1
- A1: gives 4 → so P1 plays A1 → outcome (A1,A1)

So your best strategy is to play **A0 with probability 100%**, because then P1 will play A0 (best response), and you get 6, which is **higher than any other outcome**.

The mixed strategy equilibrium exists but gives you only 2, which is worse.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to play **A0 with 100%**.

Even though in mixed equilibrium you're indifferent, the **pure strategy equilibrium** gives you a much better payoff, and you can **reach it** by playing A0 for sure.

So the answer is:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine whether you should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)

The base payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2) is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

This is a coordination-like game but with asymmetric payoffs in off-diagonal cases.

We can identify the Nash equilibria in the base game.

- If both play A0: (5,5) — both get 5.
- If both play A1: (3,3) — both get 3.
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1: (0,3) — P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3.
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0: (3,0) — P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0.

Now, consider best responses:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best to play A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best to play A1

Similarly for P2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So the pure strategy Nash equilibria are:
- (A0, A0) — mutual best response
- (A1, A1) — mutual best response

Also, a mixed strategy equilibrium exists.

But importantly: The game has two Nash equilibria. However, since (A0,A0) gives higher payoff (5,5) than (A1,A1) (3,3), **if players can coordinate**, they’d prefer (A0,A0).

But in the absence of coordination, they might end up at (A1,A1) if they miscoordinate.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

This is a **conditional payment rule** that applies **only if the contract is signed and active**.

Important: The contract becomes active **only if all players sign it**.

We are to decide whether **you** should sign it.

But note: Your decision is **only about signing** — if you sign, and the other player signs, then the contract is active.

But the other player’s decision is not known. However, since the contract is proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting, we can assume that **Player 2 has already agreed to sign it** (since it was approved).

Thus, for the contract to become active, **only your sign** is needed.

So, we must decide: **Should you sign the contract?**

But to answer that, we must evaluate whether, **under the contract**, your **expected payoff is higher than without it**, assuming both of you will play optimally (in equilibrium).

But we need to assess: what **happens to the game structure** when the contract is active?

---

### Step 3: How does the contract change the payoffs?

The contract modifies the base payoffs based on the action chosen.

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix** (including the contract effect).

Let’s denote:
- Payoff from base game + contract payment

#### Key point: "drawn equally from the other players"

- If you play A0: you **gain +2**, and this 2 points is **taken from the other player**.
- If you play A1: you **lose -2**, and this 2 points is **given to the other player**.

Let’s compute the total payoff (base + contract) for each player.

#### Case: Both play A0

- Base payoff: (5,5)
- Contract:
  - You (P1) play A0 → +2, taken from P2 → P2 loses 2
  - P2 plays A0 → +2, taken from P1 → P1 loses 2
- So net:
  - P1 gets: 5 + 2 (from contract) - 2 (pay to P2) = 5
  - P2 gets: 5 + 2 (from contract) - 2 (pay to P1) = 5

→ Still (5,5)

Wait: both gain +2 from playing A0, but each gives 2 to the other.

So net: no change.

#### Case: You play A0, P2 plays A1

- Base payoff: (0,3)
- Contract:
  - You play A0 → +2, taken from P2 → P2 loses 2
  - P2 plays A1 → -2, given to you → you gain 2
- So:
  - P1 gets: 0 (base) + 2 (contract gain) + 2 (from P2’s payment) = 4
  - P2 gets: 3 (base) - 2 (contract loss) - 2 (payment to P1) = -1

Wait — this is confusing. Let’s clarify the mechanism.

The contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you** play A0, you get +2, and that +2 comes **from the other player**.

Similarly:
> "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players."

So if you play A1, you lose 2, and that 2 is **given to the other player**.

So the payments are **between the two players**, and the amounts are fixed: +2 for A0 (from other), -2 for A1 (to other).

So in any case, the **net effect of the contract on the total payoffs** is:

- Total contract sum: for each player, their choice induces a payment to or from the other.
- But since payments are symmetric: if you play A0, you gain 2, P2 loses 2 → net contract payoff change: 0
- Similarly, if P2 plays A0, P2 gains 2, you lose 2 → net zero.
- So **the contract does not change the total sum of payoffs** — it's a zero-sum transfer.

But for each player, the contract introduces a **transfer based on actions**.

Let’s now compute the **actual payoff** under the contract.

Let’s define the **total payoff** for each player as base + contract adjustment.

---

#### Case 1: (A0, A0)
- P1: base = 5, contract: plays A0 → +2, but P2 also plays A0 → P1 pays 2 to P2 → net: 5 + 2 - 2 = 5
- P2: base = 5, contract: plays A0 → +2, but P1 pays 2 → net 5
→ (5,5)

#### Case 2: (A0, A1)
- P1: base = 0
  - plays A0 → gets +2
  - P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 2 to P1 → you get +2
  → total: 0 + 2 + 2 = 4
- P2: base = 3
  - plays A1 → pays 2 to P1 → -2
  - P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +2 from P2 → P2 loses 2 to P1 → so P2 loses 2
  → total: 3 - 2 (as player) - 2 (as payer to P1) = -1
→ (4, -1)

Wait — this cannot be.

Let’s re-read:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if you (P1) play A0, you **receive +2**, and that +2 is **taken from the other player (P2)**.

> "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players."

So if you play A1, you **pay -2**, and that -2 is **given to the other player**.

So payments are:

- When you play A0: you gain +2, P2 loses 2
- When you play A1: you lose -2 (pay), P2 gains +2

Same way for P2:
- If P2 plays A0: P2 gains +2, P1 loses 2
- If P2 plays A1: P2 loses -2, P1 gains +2

So now, compute total payoff = base + contract effect.

#### Case: (P1: A0, P2: A1)

- P1:
  - base: 0
  - contract: plays A0 → +2
  - P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 2 to P1 → +2
  → total: 0 + 2 + 2 = 4

- P2:
  - base: 3
  - contract: plays A1 → -2
  - P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +2 from P2 → P2 loses 2
  → total: 3 - 2 (as payer) - 2 (as payer to P1) = -1

**This is not consistent** — P2 is losing 4 points?

Wait — actually, no: P2 pays 2 to P1 when playing A1, and P1 takes 2 from P2 when playing A0. So both events happen, and they are separate.

So:
- P2's total contract cost = -2 (because A1) + -2 (because P1 plays A0 and takes 2) = -4
- P2 base = 3 → total = 3 - 4 = -1

Yes, that’s correct.

Similarly, P1:
- base = 0
- contract: +2 (A0), +2 (P2’s A1 payment) → total = 4

So (4, -1)

But the **total payoff sum**: 4 + (-1) = 3

Original base: 0 + 3 = 3 → same total, good.

Wait: base was 3 (total), now 3 (total). So contract is a transfer only.

But now, similarly:

#### Case: (A1, A0)

- P1: base = 3
  - plays A1 → pays 2 to P2 → -2
  - P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +2 from P1 → P1 loses 2
  → total: 3 -2 -2 = -1

- P2: base = 0
  - plays A0 → gets +2
  - P1 plays A1 → P1 pays 2 → P2 gets +2
  → total: 0 + 2 + 2 = 4

→ (-1, 4)

#### Case: (A1, A1)

- P1: base = 3
  - plays A1 → pays 2 → -2
  - P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 2 → P1 gets +2
  → total: 3 -2 +2 = 3

- P2: base = 3
  - plays A1 → pays 2 → -2
  - P1 plays A1 → P1 pays 2 → P2 gets +2
  → total: 3 -2 +2 = 3

→ (3,3)

Now, compile the **contract-affected payoff matrix**:

|               | P2: A0    | P2: A1     |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)     | (4, -1)    |
| **P1: A1**    | (-1, 4)   | (3,3)      |

---

### Step 4: Analyze the new game with contract

We now have a new game.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria.

#### Best responses?

For P1:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1: A0 → 5, A1 → -1 → best: A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1: A0 → 4, A1 → 3 → best: A0

So **P1’s best response to any strategy of P2 is A0** → A0 is dominant for P1.

For P2:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2: A0 → 5, A1 → -1 → best: A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2: A0 → 4, A1 → 3 → best: A0

So **P2’s best response is always A0** → A0 is dominant for P2.

Therefore, **(A0, A0)** is the **unique Nash equilibrium** under the contract.

And the outcome is (5,5).

---

### Step 5: Compare with base game

In the **base game**, there are **two equilibria**:
- (A0, A0) → (5,5)
- (A1, A1) → (3,3)

But without coordination, players could end up in the (A1,A1) equilibrium, which is worse.

However, if both players are **rational and can coordinate**, they can both play A0 and get 5.

But in case they miscoordinate, they might end up at (A1,A1), which gives only 3.

But in the **contracted game**, the **dominant strategy** structure is **changed**.

Now, **both players have a dominant strategy: A0**.

So regardless of what the other does, it’s best to play A0.

Thus, **(A0,A0)** is the **only equilibrium**, and **the outcome is guaranteed to be (5,5)**.

So the contract **eliminates the risk of coordination failure** at (A1,A1).

You are sure to get 5 points under the contract.

But what about without the contract?

You could get 5 points if both choose A0 — but if you’re unsure whether the other will cooperate, you might play A1 to avoid getting 0 (if they play A1).

But without the contract, **(A0,A0)** is stable, but **(A1,A1)** is also stable.

In the base game, suppose both players are rational and can coordinate — they’ll pick (A0,A0) → 5 each.

But if they cannot coordinate — for example, if they expect the other to play A1, they might play A1 themselves.

But since (A0,A0) gives the highest payoff, and it’s a symmetric coordination game, **rational players should coordinate on (A0,A0)** unless there's fear of miscoordination.

But in the **contracted version**, the miscoordination risk is **completely removed**.

- **With contract**: you **must** play A0, and so will the other player → guaranteed 5.
- **Without contract**: if you play A0, you get 5 if they play A0, but only 0 if they play A1.

So if you are uncertain, you might prefer to avoid risk.

But in the absence of communication, **players might rationally play A0 or A1 depending on expectations**.

But the key is: **with contract, you get 5 for sure.**

Without contract, if both players are rational and coordinate, you get 5.

But if coordination fails, you get 3 (if both play A1).

But since (A0,A0) is better and symmetric, **it is a focal point**.

However, the **contract removes all uncertainty**.

Therefore, **the contract makes it rational for you to play A0 with certainty**, and guarantees 5 points.

Even if you doubt the other player’s rationality, **you are better off** because the contract makes A0 your dominant strategy.

So **your guaranteed payoff under contract is 5**.

Can you get more than 5 without the contract? No.

Can you get less? Yes, possibly 0 or 3.

So **with contract**, you get **5 for sure**.

**Without contract**, your payoff depends on what the other player does.

But since you’re playing against a player who also maximizes points, and the base game has (A0,A0) as a focal equilibrium, **you should expect (A0,A0)** — unless you think they will play A1.

But with the contract, you **force** coordination.

Hence, signing the contract **improves your security**.

You go from potentially getting 0 (if they play A1 and you play A0) to **guaranteeing 5**.

Even if you think the other player might play A1, the contract makes their best response A0, so they will play A0.

Thus, by signing, you **induce a coordination on A0**.

Therefore, **the contract is beneficial**.

---

### Step 6: Final Decision

You should sign the contract because:

- It **creates a dominant strategy equilibrium at (A0, A0)**
- Guarantees you 5 points
- Eliminates the risk of getting 0 or 3
- Without the contract, you might face uncertainty or failure to coordinate
- The contract is **mutually beneficial** since both players end up with higher guaranteed payoffs

Thus, **signing is optimal**.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

The base game is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoffs (Player 1 → Player 2):

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | (5,5) | (0,3) |
| A1                            | (3,0) | (3,3) |

So:
- (A0, A0): (5,5)
- (A0, A1): (0,3)
- (A1, A0): (3,0)
- (A1, A1): (3,3)

This is **not** a coordination game like prisoner’s dilemma, but it has some similarities.

Let’s analyze best responses.

- If you think opponent chooses A0:
  - You get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → better to choose A0
- If you think opponent chooses A1:
  - You get 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → better to choose A1

So no dominant strategy.

Now check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): If you deviate to A1: you get 3 < 5 → not profitable → stable
- (A1, A1): If you deviate to A0: you get 0 < 3 → not profitable → stable
- (A0, A1): You get 0, but if you switch to A1, you get 3 → so not stable
- (A1, A0): You get 3, but if you switch to A0, you get 5 → not stable

So pure strategy Nash equilibria: **(A0,A0)** and **(A1,A1)**

---

### **Step 2: Contract Mechanism**

A contract can be introduced that:
- Modifies payoffs based on action taken
- Payment is distributed equally among other players (since only 2 players, "other players" = 1 other person)

The contracts are **only active if both players approve** — but the **winning contract is selected at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So your goal: **approve contracts that, if implemented, would improve your expected payoff, assuming the other player may also approve and the game is played optimally under the contract.**

But since contracts are selected randomly from the **max approval set**, you want to **approve contracts that are in your interest and likely to have high approval** (but note: you only control your own approval).

Also: **you are Player 1**, and are choosing which contracts to approve.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Each Contract**

---

#### **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1**
> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payment
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 1 point, distributed equally among the other players

So:
- If you choose A1: you **lose 1 point** (pay 1)
- If you choose A0: no cost

Since there is only one other player:
- Paying 1 to the other player → you lose 1, they gain 1

So this **penalizes choosing A1 by 1 point.**

Let’s see the **new payoff matrix** under C1.

Note: **Both players are subject to the same rule** (it says “a player”, so symmetric).

So the new payoffs become:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | (5 - 0, 5 - 0) = (5,5) | (0 - 0, 3 - 1) = (0,2) |
| A1                            | (3 - 1, 0 - 0) = (2,0) | (3 - 1, 3 - 1) = (2,2) |

Wait — careful: when you choose A1, you pay 1 point *to the other player*, so:
- If you choose A1, you lose 1
- Opponent gains 1 (if you play A1)

Similarly, if opponent chooses A1, they pay 1 → you gain 1

So correct matrix:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | 5, 5 | 0, 3+1 = 4 |
| A1                            | 3−1 = 2, 0 | 3−1 = 2, 3−1 = 2 |

Wait — let's re-express carefully.

- In **(A0, A0)**: No one pays → (5,5)
- In **(A0, A1)**: Opponent chooses A1 → they pay 1 → so:
  - You (A0): get 0 (base) + 1 (from opponent paying) = **1**
  - Opponent (A1): gets 3 (base) - 1 (pay) = **2**
- In **(A1, A0)**: You choose A1 → pay 1 → so:
  - You: 3 - 1 = **2**
  - Opponent: 0 + 1 (from your payment) = **1**
- In **(A1, A1)**: Both choose A1 → each pays 1:
  - You: 3 - 1 = **2**
  - Opponent: 3 - 1 = **2**

**Updated payoff matrix:**

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | (5,5) | (1,2) |
| A1                            | (2,1) | (2,2) |

Now analyze **best responses**:

- If opponent plays A0:
  - You get 5 for A0 vs 2 for A1 → prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1:
  - You get 1 for A0 vs 2 for A1 → prefer A1

So best response is still mixed?

Check for Nash equilibria:

- (A0,A0): If you deviate to A1 → get 2 < 5 → stable
- (A1,A1): If you deviate to A0 → get 1 < 2 → stable
- (A0,A1): You get 1; if you deviate to A1, you get 2 → not stable
- (A1,A0): You get 2; if you deviate to A0, you get 5 → not stable

So still two pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But now:
- In (A0,A0): you get 5
- In (A1,A1): you get 2

So under C1, **you are disincentivized from A1** (which now gives only 2 if both choose A1) and **you gain nothing extra from choosing A0** unless opponent plays A1.

But the **payoff in (A1,A1)** drops from 3 to 2.

Now — would you want this contract?

Let’s consider what happens **if both players follow the contract**.

If both players are rational, they will now consider this modified game.

But is (A0,A0) more likely? It gives 5 to you. (A1,A1) gives only 2.

But the **contract is proposed by you**, and you are Player 1.

Now, **you are considering whether to approve C1**.

C1 is **proposed by Player 1**, so **you will approve it anyway**, probably.

But let’s see: **what benefit does C1 give you?**

It penalizes A1. So if you can **coerce or encourage** your opponent to avoid A1, then you can exploit (A0,A0) and get 5.

But is that possible?

Wait: **the other player is rational too.**

Under C1, if **you play A0**, and opponent plays A0 → you get 5
But if opponent plays A1 → you get only 1 (since you get 1 from their payment)

But if you play A1 → get 2 if opponent plays A0 → but only 2 vs 5

So **A0 is strongly dominant?**

Wait: no. Let’s check.

If opponent plays A0: you prefer A0 (5 > 2)
If opponent plays A1: you prefer A1 (2 > 1)

But note: **if opponent is rational**, they will also have the same incentive.

Let’s look from **your perspective**.

With C1 in effect, what should you do?

Let’s suppose the other player plays A0 with probability q, A1 with 1−q.

Your expected payoff:
- A0: 5*q + 1*(1−q) = 5q + 1 − q = 4q + 1
- A1: 2*q + 2*(1−q) = 2q + 2 − 2q = 2

So:
- A0 gives 4q + 1
- A1 gives 2

You prefer A0 if 4q + 1 > 2 → 4q > 1 → q > 0.25

So if opponent plays A0 with > 25%, you prefer A0

But if q ≤ 0.25, you prefer A1

But also, the other player is rational and faces the same incentives.

So what is the symmetric Nash equilibrium?

Assume both players mix with same probability.

Let q be the probability opponent plays A0.

Your best response:
- Play A0 if 4q + 1 > 2 → q > 0.25
- Play A1 if q < 0.25
- Indifferent if q = 0.25

So equilibrium: opponent plays A0 with 25%

Then your best response is **mixed** — but only indifferent at q=0.25.

So symmetric mixed strategy: each plays A0 with 25%, A1 with 75%

Then your expected payoff:
- A0: 4*(0.25) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
- A1: 2
→ so indifferent

Now compute your expected payoff in equilibrium:

- Both A0: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 → payoff 5
- A0 vs A1: 0.25 * 0.75 * 2 = 0.375 → but payoffs are (1,2), so your payoff: 1
- A1 vs A0: same → 0.375 → your payoff: 2
- Both A1: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 → payoff 2

So total expected payoff:
= 0.0625*5 + 0.375*1 + 0.375*2 + 0.5625*2  
= 0.3125 + 0.375 + 0.75 + 1.125  
= 2.5625

But wait — in the pure NE:
- (A0,A0): you get 5
- (A1,A1): you get 2

But under rational play, you might end up at (A1,A1) with high probability.

But your **expected payoff** in NE is about 2.56

But if the contract is **not applied**, what is your expected payoff?

Without contract, in mixed equilibrium:

Original game:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | 5,5 | 0,3 |
| A1                            | 3,0 | 3,3 |

Find mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let q = prob opponent plays A0

Your expected payoff:
- A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 0.6

So opponent plays A0 with 60%

Then your expected payoff: 3

But also, if opponent plays A0 60%, you are indifferent, so you can mix.

But in symmetric case: both play A0 with 60%?

Wait — check equilibrium.

If you play A0 with p, opponent plays A0 with q.

Opponent's payoff:
- A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3
Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So symmetric mixed strategy: both play A0 with 60%

Then your expected payoff:
- (A0,A0): 0.6*0.6 = 0.36 → 5
- (A0,A1): 0.6*0.4 = 0.24 → 0
- (A1,A0): 0.4*0.6 = 0.24 → 3
- (A1,A1): 0.4*0.4 = 0.16 → 3

Total: 0.36*5 + 0.24*0 + 0.24*3 + 0.16*3 = 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

So without contract: you get **3**

With C1 contract: you get **2.5625** in NE → worse!

But: what if both players coordinate on (A0,A0)?

That would give you 5 — better.

But with C1, is (A0,A0) sustainable?

Suppose you both want to play A0.

But if you think opponent will play A0, then you prefer A0 → 5 vs 2 (from playing A1)

So (A0,A0) is a NE under C1.

But **is it likely?** There is also (A1,A1) as NE with payoff 2.

But (A0,A0) is better.

But if you are not coordinating, you might end up in the mixed NE.

But the contract allows for coordination through incentives.

But here’s the key: **you are Player 1, proposing C1**.

So you **approve it** — obviously.

But would you approve it **if you were neutral**?

You get **3** in base game.

Under C1, if both players are rational and play mixed strategy Nash, you get **2.5625 < 3**

But if you can coordinate on (A0,A0), you get 5.

But in the absence of communication, players may not coordinate.

But — **this is a contract that can be enforced** only if both approve.

But since you are **Player 1**, and C1 is **your own proposal**, you **will approve it**.

But let's not jump to conclusions.

We are to **approve contracts** based on whether they improve your **expected payoff**, assuming the other player may also approve.

But **if the contract is implemented**, we must assume rational play under the contract.

But if C1 is adopted, and both players play according to rational strategy, you get **2.5625 < 3**, so **worse than base game**

So **C1 hurts you in equilibrium**

But wait — maybe you can **induce** player 2 to play A0?

No, because C1 applies symmetrically.

Player 2 also has the disincentive to play A1.

So if you both follow C1, and both are rational, you end up in mixed equilibrium with lower payoff than base game.

So C1 **reduces your expected payoff** in rational play.

So **you should not approve C1**?

But **C1 is your own proposal** — you can only approve it if it benefits you.

But let’s not forget: **you are deciding which contracts to approve**, and the one that gains the most approvals is selected randomly.

So you may want to approve contracts that:
- You benefit from
- Are likely to be approved by the other player (so it gets selected)

But **you don't know** what the other player will do.

But you can anticipate.

Now consider **C2: Proposed by Player 2**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 1 point, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So under C2:
- Choosing A0: you gain 1 (you get 1 from the other player)
- Choosing A1: you lose 2 (you pay 2 to the other player)

So this strongly penalizes A1 and rewards A0.

Let’s compute the new payoff matrix.

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | (5 + 1, 5 + 1) = (6,6) → but wait: **the payment is “drawn equally from the other players”** → so if you choose A0, you get 1 point **from the other player**.
  → So your payoff increases by 1, opponent decreases by 1.

Similarly, if opponent chooses A0 → opponent gains 1, you lose 1.

So careful:

- If you play A0: you get +1
- If you play A1: you pay -2
- If opponent plays A0: opponent gets +1 → you lose 1
- If opponent plays A1: opponent pays -2 → you gain +2

So updated payoffs:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | 5 + 1 = 6, 5 − 1 = 4 | 0 − 1 = −1, 3 + 2 = 5 |
| A1                            | 3 − 2 = 1, 0 + 2 = 2 | 3 − 2 = 1, 3 − 2 = 1 |

Breakdown:

- (A0,A0): you play A0 (+1), opponent plays A0 (+1) → you get 5+1=6, opponent gets 5−1=4
- (A0,A1): you play A0 (+1), opponent plays A1 (−2) → you get 0 +1 (from your A0) −2 (from opponent’s payment) = −1? Wait — no.

Wait: **The payment is only based on your own action.**

The rule says:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive +1 (drawn from other player)

> If they choose A1, they pay −2 (distributed to others)

So it's **per player, action-based**, not joint.

So when you choose A0 → you gain 1
When opponent chooses A0 → opponent gains 1 → you lose 1
When you choose A1 → you pay 2 → lose 2
When opponent chooses A1 → opponent pays 2 → you gain 2

So now:

- (A0,A0): You: 5 +1 (from your A0) = 6; Opp: 5 +1 (from their A0) = 6? But no — the gain from your A0 is from the other player → who is opponent → so opponent must pay you 1 → so opponent loses 1.

So:
- You play A0: get +1
- Opponent play A0: get +1 → so opponent loses 1
- So (A0,A0): You: 5 +1 (from your A0) = 6, Opp: 5 +1 (from their A0) = 6 → but both can’t gain unless money is created.

Wait — this is inconsistent.

But the contract says: "drawn equally from the other players" — so if you choose A0, you get 1 point **from the other players**.

But since only one other player, you gain 1, other player loses 1.

Similarly, if you choose A1, you pay 2 — so the money is distributed **to the other players**.

So if you play A1 → you lose 2 → other player gains 2.

So **the total surplus changes?**

But the key is: **the payments are in addition to base payoffs**.

So for (A0,A0):

- Base: (5,5)
- You play A0 → you gain 1 → total: 6
- Opponent plays A0 → they gain 1 → they get 6
→ But then total points = 12, but base was 10 → so 2 extra generated?

But the contract says: "additional payment" — so yes, it's extra money.

But is that realistic? Probably not, but the game allows it.

Alternatively, maybe the "drawn from" means the other player pays.

So:
- If you play A0 → you receive 1 from opponent
- If you play A1 → you pay 2 to opponent

So net transfer:

- A0: you gain 1
- A1: you lose 2

Same for the other player.

So total money is **not conserved** — it's **added or subtracted**.

So the total payout increases or decreases.

But in this case:

- A0 gives +1 to the player
- A1 gives −2 to the player

So in (A0,A0): both gain 1 → total +2
In (A1,A1): both lose 2 → total −4

But we proceed.

So new matrix:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | 5 + 1 = 6, 5 + 1 = 6 → but wait: you play A0 → you get +1; opponent plays A0 → they get +1 → so yes: (6,6) |
| A0 vs A1                       | You: 0 + 1 = 1 (you get +1 for your A0), opponent: 3 - 2 = 1 (opponent plays A1 → pays 2 → you gain 2? Wait no)

Wait: let’s clarify **who gets what**.

When a player chooses A0, they **receive 1** (drawn from other players)

When a player chooses A1, they **pay 2** (to other players)

So the **payment is based on the player's choice**, not the joint action.

So in (A0,A1):
- You: choose A0 → you get +1
- Opponent: chooses A1 → they pay −2 (lose 2)
- So your total: base 0 + +1 = **1**
- Opponent total: base 3 + (−2) = **1**

In (A1,A0):
- You: A1 → lose 2
- Opponent: A0 → gain +1
- Your total: 3 − 2 = **1**
- Opponent: 0 + 1 = **1**

In (A1,A1):
- You: A1 → −2
- Opponent: A1 → −2
- Your total: 3 − 2 = **1**
- Opponent: 3 − 2 = **1**

In (A0,A0):
- You: +1 → total 6
- Opponent: +1 → total 6

But wait — this can’t be: in (A0,A0), both get +1? Then total is 5+5+2 = 12

But the base game has 10 points. Now it has 12.

But that’s what the contract says.

So matrix:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | (6,6) | (1,1) |
| A1                            | (1,1) | (1,1) |

Wait, really?

Let’s verify:

- (A0,A0): You choose A0 → +1; opponent chooses A0 → +1 → so (5+1, 5+1) = (6,6)
- (A0,A1): You: A0 → +1 → 0+1=1; opponent: A1 → −2 → 3−2=1 → (1,1)
- (A1,A0): You: A1 → −2 → 3−2=1; opponent: A0 → +1 → 0+1=1 → (1,1)
- (A1,A1): You: −2 → 3−2=1; opponent: −2 → 3−2=1 → (1,1)

So the **entire game becomes constant payoff (1,1)** except (A0,A0) which gives (6,6)

You get 6 only if **both choose A0**

Otherwise you get 1

Now, is (A0,A0) a Nash equilibrium?

- If opponent plays A0:
  - You get 6 for A0, 1 for A1 → prefer A0 → stable
- If opponent plays A1:
  - You get 1 for A0, 1 for A1 → indifferent

So yes, (A0,A0) is a NE

But is it the only one?

- (A0,A1): You get 1, but if you switch to A1 → get 1 → indifferent → so you could deviate
- But only if opponent plays A1 → you are indifferent

So (A0,A1) is not a strict NE, but could be support.

But suppose both players play A0 with high probability.

In fact, if both players are rational, they will **want to coordinate on (A0,A0)** to get 6.

But since (A1,A1) and others give only 1, the payoff in (A0,A0) is much better.

Now, what is the symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium?

Let q = prob opponent plays A0

Your expected payoff:
- A0: 6*q + 1*(1−q) = 6q + 1 − q = 5q + 1
- A1: 1*q + 1*(1−q) = 1

You prefer A0 if 5q + 1 > 1 → 5q > 0 → q > 0

So you prefer A0 for **any** q > 0

You are indifferent at q=0.

But at q=0 (opponent plays A1), you are indifferent.

But if opponent plays A1, you get 1 regardless.

So the best response to any q > 0 is A0

Only when q=0, you are indifferent.

So in symmetric equilibrium, if you play A0 with p, opponent must play A0 with q.

Opponent’s best response: play A0 if q > 0, otherwise indifferent.

To have symmetric equilibrium, if p>0, then opponent wants to play A0.

Only equilibrium: p=1 → both play A0

Because if p<1, then q<1, but if q>0, you prefer A0 → contradiction unless p=1

At p=1, opponent gets 6 if they play A0, 1 if they play A1 → so prefers A0

So **only symmetric pure NE is (A0,A0)**

And it is strict.

So under C2, if the contract is in place, **both players will play A0** → you get 6

But what about the base game? You get **3**

So C2 gives you **6** → far better.

Now, would the other player approve C2?

They get:
- In (A0,A0): 6
- In others: 1

So they also **much prefer** (A0,A0) → so they should **approve C2**

So C2 is **strongly beneficial** for both players.

You get 6 vs 3 in base.

So you should **approve C2**

But is there a catch?

Wait: C2 is **proposed by Player 2**, who wants to **enforce better coordination**

But **you are Player 1** — and you benefit from it.

So you should **approve C2**

Now, what about C1?

C1 gave you **2.5625 < 3** in equilibrium → worse

And it is **your own proposal**, but it harms you

So **you should not approve C1**

Even though you proposed it, it’s not beneficial — so you should reject it.

But wait: what if **both players approve C1**?

Then you get 2.56 < 3 → worse than base

So no benefit.

But under **C2**, if both approve, you get 6 — better

So **you should approve C2**, but **not approve C1**

But let’s double-check C2.

In C2, if both players play A0, you get 6

But is there a risk of not coordinating?

No — in rational play, **the only equilibrium is (A0,A0)** — because anyone who plays A1 gets 1 regardless, while A0 gives 6 if opponent plays A0, and 1 otherwise.

But suppose opponent plays A1 with very small probability.

Then you get 6q + 1 → which is almost 6 if q is not too small.

And since you get 1 from A1, you prefer A0 for any q>0

So **dominant strategy to play A0**?

Wait: if opponent plays A0 for sure, you get 6 for A0, 1 for A1 → play A0

If opponent plays A1 for sure, you get 1 for A0, 1 for A1 → indifferent

But if opponent plays A1 with probability ε>0, then:
- A0: 6*ε + 1*(1−ε) = 6ε + 1 − ε = 5ε + 1
- A1: 1

Now, 5ε + 1 > 1 for ε>0 → so you strictly prefer A0

Only when ε=0, you are indifferent

So for **any** positive probability that opponent plays A0, you prefer A0

Thus, **playing A0 is a weakly dominant strategy**

So **both players have weakly dominant strategy: A0**

Thus, **both will play A0** → outcome (A0,A0) → you get 6

So **guaranteed 6** → far better than base game’s 3

So C2 is **very beneficial**

C1, on the other hand, **reduces your expected payoff** under rational play

So you should approve C2 but not C1

---

### **Final Decision**

- **C1 (Proposed by you)**: You should not approve — it harms your expected payoff
- **C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**: You should approve — it drastically improves your payoff

But note: the winning contract is selected **uniformly at random from those with maximum number of approvals**

So if you approve only C2, and player 2 may approve C2, then C2 has 2 approvals → wins

If you also approve C1, both have 2 approvals, so one is chosen at random → but C1 is bad for you, so you don’t want random chance of C1

So **you should only approve C2**

Thus:

```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}

response:
Let's go step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game where:

- Each player chooses A0 or A1 with some probability.
- We are Player 2 (this will matter for payoffs and incentives).
- The base payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:

|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P2: A1** | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

So, as Player 2:

- If I choose A0:
  - If P1 chooses A0 → I get 5
  - If P1 chooses A1 → I get 3
- If I choose A1:
  - If P1 chooses A0 → I get 0
  - If P1 chooses A1 → I get 3

So for Player 2, A1 is better than A0 **only if** P1 chooses A0 — but then I get 0 vs 5. So A0 dominates A1 **if P1 plays A0 with high probability**.

Let’s analyze best responses.

Define:
- p = probability that Player 1 chooses A0
- (1–p) = probability Player 1 chooses A1

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- A0: 5p + 3(1–p) = 5p + 3 – 3p = 2p + 3
- A1: 0p + 3(1–p) = 3(1–p) = 3 – 3p

Compare:
- A0 > A1 ? ⇒ 2p + 3 > 3 – 3p ⇒ 5p > 0 ⇒ p > 0
- So for any p > 0, A0 is better.
- Even at p = 0 (P1 always plays A1), A0 gives 3, A1 gives 3 → equal.
- So A0 dominates A1 for Player 2.

Similarly, for Player 1:
- A0: 5q + 3(1–q) = 5q + 3 – 3q = 2q + 3
- A1: 0q + 3(1–q) = 3 – 3q
- A0 > A1 when 2q + 3 > 3 – 3q ⇒ 5q > 0 ⇒ q > 0 ⇒ A0 dominates

So in the base game, **both players have A0 as a dominant strategy**.

Thus, the Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0), and both get 5 points.

But wait — what about (A1, A1)? That gives (3,3), which is worse for both than (5,5). So not attractive.

So **in the base game, both players have a dominant strategy to play A0**, leading to (5,5).

Now the twist: **a contract** can be introduced, but **only if both players approve it via a voting process**. The contract we pick is the one with **maximum approvals**, and if tie, it is **chosen uniformly at random**.

We are to decide: **Should we approve C1 (Player 1's contract)** and **C2 (Player 2's contract)**?

Note: We are **Player 2**, so we want to **maximize our total expected points**, including the contract payments.

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

---

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payment in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since there are only two players, “other players” means the single opponent.

So:
- If you play A1 → you pay 1 point to the other player.
- If you play A0 → nothing changes.

Note: the payment is **from the player who chooses A1 to the other player**.

So **net effect** on your payoff (as Player 2):

- If you choose A0: your payoff is unchanged
- If you choose A1: your payoff is **reduced by 1** due to the payment.

But also: when the **other player** chooses A1, **they pay you** 1 point, so you gain **+1**.

So let's make a table of total payoff for Player 2 under C1, given own action and P1's action:

| P2's Action | P1's Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment (P2 gets) | **Total Payoff (C1)** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0          | 5           | 0                             | **5**                  |
| A0          | A1          | 3           | +1 (P1 chose A1, so P2 gets 1) | **4**                  |
| A1          | A0          | 0           | 0                             | **0**                  |
| A1          | A1          | 3           | +1 (P1 chose A1 → P2 gets 1)   | **4**                  |

So for Player 2, under C1:
- A0 vs A0 → 5
- A0 vs A1 → 4
- A1 vs A0 → 0
- A1 vs A1 → 4

Now, suppose we are choosing strategy (as Player 2), what is our best response under this contract?

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays mixed strategy: A0 with prob p, A1 with 1–p.

Then Player 2's expected payoff:
- A0: 5p + 4(1–p) = 5p + 4 – 4p = p + 4
- A1: 0p + 4(1–p) = 4(1–p) = 4 – 4p

Compare:
- A0 > A1? ⇒ p + 4 > 4 – 4p ⇒ p > –4p ⇒ 5p > 0 ⇒ p > 0
→ A0 is always better for Player 2 (unless p = 0, but even then equal: 4 = 4)

So A0 still dominates A1.

So under C1, Player 2 still prefers A0 no matter what P1 does.

Also, **Player 2 benefits from P1 playing A1** (gets +1), but still, A0 is better.

Now, what about **Player 1**? Let’s check if they are better off.

Player 1’s payoff under C1 (Player 1's own perspective):
- A0 vs A0: 5 + 0 = 5
- A0 vs A1: 3 + 0 = 3? Wait — no.

Wait: When Player 1 chooses A1 → they pay 1 point to the other player (Player 2), so they lose 1.

So:
- P1 A0, P2 A0 → 5
- P1 A0, P2 A1 → 3 – 1 = 2? Wait — no.

Wait: The payment happens **if you play A1**, and it's **paid to the other player**.

So:
- If P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0 → P1 pays 1 to P2 → P1’s net: 3 – 1 = 2
- If P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A1 → P1 pays 1 to P2 → P1’s net: 3 – 1 = 2

Wait — that’s not right.

In base game:
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3
- (A1, A1): both get 3

Now with C1:
- P1 choosing A1 pays 1 point → so their base payoff is **reduced by 1**
- P2, when P1 chooses A1 (regardless of P2’s move), gets +1 (from P1’s payment)

So P1’s adjusted payoffs:

| P1 | P2 | Base | Adjustment (P1 pays 1) | P1 Actual |
|----|----|------|------------------------|-----------|
| A0 | A0 | 5    | 0                      | 5         |
| A0 | A1 | 3    | 0                      | 3         |
| A1 | A0 | 0    | –1                     | –1        |
| A1 | A1 | 3    | –1                     | 2         |

Now as P1 chooses against P2:

- P1 A0: gets 5p + 3(1–p) = 2p + 3
- P1 A1: (–1)p + 2(1–p) = –p + 2 – 2p = 2 – 3p

Compare:
- A0 > A1? ⇒ 2p + 3 > 2 – 3p ⇒ 5p > –1 ⇒ always true for p ≥ 0

So A0 still dominates for P1.

So both players prefer A0 under C1, and equilibrium is (A0, A0), both get **5**.

But wait: under C1, when both play A0 → no payments, so still (5,5)

So under C1, outcome remains (5,5), and both get same as before.

But — is there any benefit?

- If both played A1, base was 3 each, but now:
  - P1: 3 – 1 = 2
  - P2: 3 + 1 = 4
  So P2 gains, P1 loses.

But since both have incentive to play A0, this is not an issue.

So C1 does not change the equilibrium — both still play A0, payoffs unchanged.

But note: **C1 is proposed by Player 1**, and we (Player 2) might consider approving it.

But we are not worse off.

In fact, we **gain when P1 plays A1**, but since P1 won’t do that, it doesn’t matter.

So from our perspective, **C1 doesn't hurt us**, and doesn't help us much, but doesn’t change outcome.

But wait: are we forced to play differently? No.

So **C1 is benign** for us.

But now consider **C2**.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2 — that’s us!)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So for **Player 2** (us):

- If we play A0 → we receive 1 point from the other player (Player 1)
- If we play A1 → we pay 2 points to the other player (so lose 2)

Also:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → Player 1 gets +1 → so **we (Player 2)** pay 1 to Player 1
- If Player 1 plays A1 → Player 1 pays 2 → so **we (Player 2) get 2** from Player 1

Let’s now define total payoff for Player 2 under C2, based on both actions.

| P2 | P1 | Base | C2 Adjustment (P2 gets) | Total Payoff |
|----|----|------|--------------------------|--------------|
| A0 | A0 | 5    | +1 (P2's A0 gives +1 to P2) – 1 (P1's A0 charges P2 1) = 0? Wait.

Wait — need to be careful.

The contract says:

- If a player chooses A0 → **they receive 1 point from the other player**
- If a player chooses A1 → **they pay 2 points to the other player**

So **payments are bilateral**.

So for each pair:

1. P2 A0, P1 A0:
   - P2: gets 1 (from P1) due to P2's A0
   - P2: pays 1 (to P1) due to P1's A0
   → Net payment to P2: 0
   - Base: 5
   → Total: **5**

2. P2 A0, P1 A1:
   - P2: gets 1 (from P1) due to P2's A0
   - P2: pays 2 (to P1) due to P1's A1
   → Net payment: 1 – 2 = –1
   - Base: 3
   → Total: **3 – 1 = 2**

3. P2 A1, P1 A0:
   - P2: pays 2 (to P1) due to P2's A1
   - P2: gets 1 (from P1) due to P1's A0
   → Net: –2 + 1 = –1
   - Base: 0
   → Total: **–1**

4. P2 A1, P1 A1:
   - P2: pays 2 (due to P2's A1)
   - P2: gets 2 (due to P1's A1 → P1 pays 2 to other player)
   → Net: –2 + 2 = 0
   - Base: 3
   → Total: **3**

So table for Player 2:

| P2 | P1 | Total Payoff (C2) |
|----|----|-------------------|
| A0 | A0 | 5                 |
| A0 | A1 | 2                 |
| A1 | A0 | –1                |
| A1 | A1 | 3                 |

Now, compute expected payoff for Player 2 under C2, given P1 plays A0 with probability p.

- E[A0]: 5p + 2(1–p) = 5p + 2 – 2p = 3p + 2
- E[A1]: (–1)p + 3(1–p) = –p + 3 – 3p = 3 – 4p

Compare:
- A0 > A1? ⇒ 3p + 2 > 3 – 4p ⇒ 7p > 1 ⇒ p > 1/7

So if p > 1/7, A0 is better
If p < 1/7, A1 is better
If p = 1/7, equal

So **A0 is not dominant** anymore — it depends on P1’s strategy.

But now, what about **P1’s incentives** under C2?

Let’s compute P1’s payoffs under C2.

P1:
- If P1 plays A0 → gets 1 from P2 (because P2 plays A0) → but also:
  - In C2: if P1 plays A0 → they receive 1 → so +1
  - But if P2 plays A0 → P1 pays 1 to P2 → so –1
  - So net: +1 – 1 = 0 (if P2 plays A0)
  - If P2 plays A1 → P1 pays 1 to P2 (because P1 plays A0 → gets 1 from P2? No)

Wait — let’s be precise.

For P1:
- When P1 plays A0 → they **receive 1** from the system (from other player)
- But they **pay 1** if P2 plays A0 (because P2 plays A0 → P2 gets 1 from P1)

Wait, no: The contract says:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive 1 point(s), **drawn equally from the other players**

So:
- If P2 plays A0 → P2 gets 1, so **P1 pays 1 to P2**
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 1, so **P2 pays 1 to P1**

So in each case, **each player pays 1 to the other if the other plays A0?** No.

Wait — let’s parse:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So: when a player plays A0, they **collect 1** point **from the other player**.

Similarly, if a player plays A1, they **pay 2** points **to the other player**.

So:

- P2 plays A0 → P2 collects 1 point from P1 (P1 pays)
- P1 plays A0 → P1 collects 1 point from P2 (P2 pays)

So both sides **exchange 1 point** when both play A0 → payment is **net zero**.

But in other cases:

- P2 A0, P1 A1:
  - P2: gets 1 from P1 (because P2 plays A0)
  - P1: pays 2 to P2 (because P1 plays A1)
  → So P2 pays 1 to P1 (if P1 plays A0), but P1 pays 2 to P2 (if P1 plays A1)

So for **P1’s payoff** under C2:

| P1 | P2 | Base | Adjustment (P1 gets) | Total |
|----|----|------|------------------------|-------|
| A0 | A0 | 5    | +1 (P1 plays A0) –1 (P2 plays A0 → P1 pays 1) = 0 | 5 |
| A0 | A1 | 3    | +1 (P1 A0) –2 (P2 A1 → P1 pays 2) = –1 | 3 –1 = 2 |
| A1 | A0 | 0    | –2 (P1 A1) +1 (P2 A0 → P1 gets 1) = –1 | 0 –1 = –1 |
| A1 | A1 | 3    | –2 (P1 A1) +2 (P2 A1 → P1 gets 2) = 0 | 3 |

So P1's payoffs (C2):

- A0 vs A0: 5
- A0 vs A1: 2
- A1 vs A0: –1
- A1 vs A1: 3

Now, P1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 5p + 2(1–p) = 5p + 2 – 2p = 3p + 2
- A1: (–1)p + 3(1–p) = –p + 3 – 3p = 3 – 4p

Compare:
- A0 > A1? ⇒ 3p + 2 > 3 – 4p ⇒ 7p > 1 ⇒ p > 1/7

Same as Player 2!

So both players are symmetric in incentives under C2.

So Nash equilibrium: both play A0 if p > 1/7, but if P1 plays A0 with p ≤ 1/7, then A1 is better for P2.

But what is the symmetric equilibrium?

Suppose both play A0 with probability q.

Then p = q.

Then for each player:
- E[A0] = 3q + 2
- E[A1] = 3 – 4q

Set equal: 3q + 2 = 3 – 4q ⇒ 7q = 1 ⇒ q = 1/7

So symmetric mixed strategy NE: **each plays A0 with probability 1/7, A1 with 6/7**

Now compute **expected payoff** for Player 2 under this NE (with C2):

E = (1/7) * [3*(1/7) + 2] + (6/7) * [3 – 4*(1/7)]
Wait no.

Better: since symmetric, we can plug in.

P1 plays A0 with p = 1/7.

Then P2’s expected payoff:
- A0: 3p + 2 = 3*(1/7) + 2 = 3/7 + 14/7 = 17/7 ≈ 2.4286
- A1: 3 – 4p = 3 – 4/7 = 17/7 ≈ 2.4286 → equal

So expected payoff under NE (both playing A0 with 1/7) → **17/7 ≈ 2.4286**

But wait — is this the best we can do?

Actually, no — that’s the payoff **at equilibrium**.

But we are evaluating whether to **approve C2**.

But here’s the issue: **if we approve C2, and if other player approves it**, it will be applied.

But we are deciding whether to **approve it** — and we want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

But under C2, the **equilibrium** is **not A0**, but mixed.

And our **expected payoff is about 2.43**, which is **much less than the base 5**.

So under C2, even though the contract is our proposal, the **incentives are changed so drastically** that we end up playing A1 most of the time.

Why? Because:
- If P1 plays A0 with low probability, then A1 is better.
- But we are both trying to maximize, so both play A1 often.

Result: expected payoff ≈ 2.43, which is **worse than base game (5)**.

Moreover, the outcome (A1, A1) is now **more likely**, but gives only 3 in base, and under C2: 3 + 0 = 3 (no net payment), still 3.

But in C2:
- A1,A1: both pay 2, both get 2 → net 0, so base 3, total 3
- A0,A0: both get +1 and –1 → net 0, base 5 → total 5

But since both prefer A1 unless the other plays A0 often, and they don’t, they play A1.

So **C2 leads to lower expected payoff than the base game**.

Now, compare to **C1**:

Under C1, as we saw, **A0 still dominates** for both players, so (A0, A0) is still the equilibrium, payoffs remain 5.

So **C1 gives us 5** in expected payoff.

**C2 gives us ~2.43** in expected payoff (if approved and played).

So **C2 is worse for us**.

But what if **we approve C2, but P1 does not**?

Then **C2 is not implemented**.

So the contract is only applied if **both approve**.

Similarly for C1.

Now, we are deciding which contracts to **approve**.

We want to **maximize our expected points**.

So we need to ask: **for each contract, what is its expected outcome (payoff) if it is adopted?**

But: the winning contract is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if we approve both C1 and C2, and P1 approves C1 only, then:
- C1 has 2 approvals (us and P1)
- C2 has 1 approval (us)
→ so C1 wins.

If we approve only C1, and P1 approves C1, then C1 wins.

If we approve both, and P1 approves both, then max approvals = 2 → random selection between C1 and C2 → we get either C1 (payoff 5) or C2 (payoff ~2.43) → expected payoff: (5 + 2.43)/2 ≈ 3.715

But **we don’t know what P1 will do**.

To be safe, we must consider what P1 might do.

But we are told: **you** are to decide. We are Player 2.

We must make a **rational decision**.

Key insight: **we do not know** how P1 will vote.

But we are to **maximize our total points**, so we need to choose approvals that maximize our **expected utility**, **given that the contract is selected at random among the most approved ones**.

But since we don’t know P1’s behavior, we have to assume worst case or best case?

No — we are to **rational self-interested**.

We want to **maximize our minimum expected payoff?** Or assume P1 is rational?

But the problem doesn't specify P1's behavior.

However, we can **assume that P1 will also try to maximize their own payoff**.

So we can **anticipate** P1’s decisions.

Let’s analyze P1’s preferences.

---

### **Step 3: Anticipate P1’s Behavior**

P1 will approve a contract if it makes their **expected payoff higher than under the base game**, or at least not lower.

In base game: P1 gets 5.

#### **P1’s view of C1 (proposed by P1)**

- Under C1: A0 still dominates, so (A0, A0) → P1 gets 5.
- So P1 is **indifferent** — same as base.

But does C1 help P1?

In C1:
- If P1 plays A1, they **pay 1**, so worse (e.g., (A1, A0): 0 → –1)
- But P1 won’t play A1 anyway.

So P1 gets **5** in equilibrium.

Same as base.

But **P1 has no downside**.

So **P1 will approve C1**, because it doesn’t hurt, and might help?

Wait — in (A1, A1): base 3, but with C1: P1 pays 1 → gets 2, which is worse.

But since A0 dominates, P1 won’t play A1.

So P1 gets exactly 5 regardless.

So P1 **is indifferent**.

But since it doesn’t hurt, and might be seen as a "safe" option, and no cost, **P1 will approve C1**.

Now, **P1’s view of C2 (proposed by P2)**

C2 is a **loss to P1** in most cases.

Let’s check P1’s expected payoff under C2.

From above:

- P1’s best response is to play A0 if p > 1/7, etc.

- NE: both play A0 with 1/7, payoffs ≈ 2.43

Which is **less than 5**.

So under C2, P1 gets **~2.43**, which is **much worse** than base 5.

So **P1 will not approve C2**, because it reduces their expected payoff.

So P1 will **only approve C1**, and **not approve C2**.

Now back to us (Player 2).

We are to decide:

- Do we approve C1?
- Do we approve C2?

We know:
- P1 will approve C1, reject C2.

Now, suppose we approve C1 and C2.

Then:
- C1: approved by us and P1 → 2 approvals
- C2: approved by us only → 1 approval
→ so C1 wins (max approvals)

We get C1 → payoff = 5

If we approve only C1, and P1 approves C1 → C1 wins → payoff = 5

If we approve only C2, and P1 rejects C2 → only C2 has 1 approval, but C1 has 2 → C1 wins → we get 5

If we approve neither → no contracts → base game → we get 5

So in **all cases**, if we **do not** win a contract with C2, we get 5.

But if we **approve C2**, and **P1 approves C2**, then both C1 and C2 have 2 approvals → random selection → we get either:
- C1: payoff 5 → with prob 1/2
- C2: payoff ~2.43 → prob 1/2

Expected payoff: (5 + 2.43)/2 = 3.715

But **P1 will not approve C2**, because it hurts them.

So **C2 will never be adopted**.

Thus, **even if we approve C2, C2 will not win** — because P1 won’t approve it.

So the outcome is always **C1 wins or no contract**.

But if no contract, we get base 5.

If C1 is approved (by both), we get 5.

So **in all scenarios, we get 5**.

But now: does **approving C2 hurt us**?

No — it doesn’t hurt us.

But does it **help us**?

Only if C2 wins.

But C2 **cannot** win, because P1 won’t approve it.

So **we gain nothing** from approving C2.

But if we approve C2, and P1 approves C1, then C1 wins.

No problem.

But could **C2** win?

Only if **P1 also approves it**.

But P1 will not approve it, because under C2, their expected payoff is ~2.43 < 5.

So P1 will not approve C2.

So C2 **cannot** win.

Thus, **approving C2 has no benefit**, and **no cost**.

But is that true?

Wait — **C2 could only win if P1 approves it**.

Since P1 won’t, C2 **can't win**.

So our decision to approve C2 **does not change the outcome**.

We get 5 regardless.

So we **could** approve C2 and it doesn’t hurt.

But the question is: **should we approve it?**

There is no downside, but **no upside** either.

But let’s double-check: is it possible that **approving C2 could lead to a higher payoff**?

Only if P1 approves it, but they won’t.

So no.

But wait — could we **influence P1**?

No — we are to make rational decisions.

P1 has no incentive to approve C2.

So we must assume they won’t.

Thus, **approving C2 is useless**.

But is it harmful?

No.

But let's consider: suppose we **don't** approve C2, and P1 **does** approve it, but then only C2 has 1 approval, C1 has 2 → C1 wins → same.

So no problem.

Thus, **approving C2 has no strategic value**.

But we are allowed to approve or not.

Since there’s **no benefit** and **no cost**, we might as well **approve C1**, and **not approve C2**, or **approve both**.

But **approving C1 is beneficial** — it is adopted and gives us 5.

**Approving C2 is neutral**.

But here’s a key point: **we do not need to approve C2 to get the benefit — C1 gives us 5, and we can get that by approving C1**.

So **approving C2 is a wasted vote** — it doesn’t help.

But if we approve C2, we are not worse off, but we don’t gain.

So from a **strictly maximizing** perspective, since we don't gain anything by approving C2, and **we don't know if it might cause a conflict**, but we do know that it’s **never adopted**, we might as well **not approve it** to avoid any unnecessary risk.

But actually, no risk.

But let’s ask: **why would we approve C2?**

Only if it increases our chance of a better outcome.

But it doesn’t.

In fact, **C2 reduces our expected payoff** (from 5 to ~2.43), so we would **never want to risk it**.

So we should **never approve C2**, because:
- It leads to a worse equilibrium
- P1 won’t approve it anyway
- But if we **do** approve it, it doesn't help

So to be safe, we **should not approve C2**.

**Approve C1? Yes.**

Because:
- P1 will approve it
- We approve it → C1 wins → we get 5

Which is better than base 5? Same.

But **C1 is at least safe**.

But base is also 5.

But with C1, we are **guaranteed** 5? Not exactly — only if both approve.

But P1 will approve C1, and we approve it → C1 wins → 5.

If we don’t approve C1, but P1 does → then only C1 has 1 approval → but C2? If we don’t approve C1, and approve C2, then:
- C1: 1 approval (P1)
- C2: 1 approval (us) → both have 1 → random winner → we get C1 with 5 or C2 with 2.43 → expected 3.715

Worse than 5.

So if we **don’t approve C1**, and P1 does, then we get expected 3.715.

But if we **approve C1**, we get 5.

So we should approve C1.

And C2? No.

So final answer:

We approve C1, not C2.

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

- Approve C1: **yes** (because it leads to safe 5, and P1 will approve it)
- Approve C2: **no** (because it reduces our payoff, and P1 won’t approve it anyway)

	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Modified Payoffs

First, I need to calculate the actual payoffs after applying the contract. The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they get +4 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1, no payment

## Step 2: Calculate All Four Outcomes

Let me compute my payoff (Player 1) for each scenario:

**(A0, A0):** 
- Base payoff: 5
- I chose A0: +4 from other player
- Other chose A0: -4 to other player
- **My total: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5**

**(A0, A1):**
- Base payoff: 0
- I chose A0: +4 from other player
- Other chose A1: no payment
- **My total: 0 + 4 = 4**

**(A1, A0):**
- Base payoff: 3
- I chose A1: no payment
- Other chose A0: -4 to other player
- **My total: 3 - 4 = -1**

**(A1, A1):**
- Base payoff: 3
- No contract payments
- **My total: 3**

## Step 3: Analyze Best Strategy

My payoff matrix becomes:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → **A0 is better**

No matter what the other player does, A0 is strictly better for me!

## Step 4: Check Nash Equilibrium

By symmetry, the other player faces the same payoff structure, so A0 is also their dominant strategy.

At (A0, A0), neither player wants to deviate (deviating to A1 would drop payoff from 5 to -1).

## Conclusion

A0 is a strictly dominant strategy. I should choose it with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.

- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
Let's go step by step to determine whether you should sign the contract.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without any contract)**

The game is a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (for Player 1, you) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------------------|----|----|
| A0                  | 5,5 | 0,3 |
| A1                  | 3,0 | 3,3 |

Let’s analyze this game for equilibria.

#### Check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): If Player 1 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no incentive.  
  If Player 2 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no incentive.  
  ✅ Nash equilibrium.

- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0. If they switch to A1, get 3 > 0 → deviate → not equilibrium.

- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3. If they switch to A0, get 5 > 3 → deviate. Not equilibrium.

- (A1, A1): Player 1 gets 3. If they switch to A0, get 0 < 3 → no incentive.  
  Player 2 gets 3. If they switch to A0, get 0 < 3 → no incentive.  
  ✅ Nash equilibrium.

So there are **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

Now, which one is more likely? Note that (A0, A0) gives both players 5, which is better than 3 in (A1, A1), so (A0, A0) is Pareto superior.

But if both players are rational and believe the other will play A0, they might coordinate on A0. However, since both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are equilibria, coordination is uncertain.

Also, if you are unsure what the other player will do, you might consider expected values.

But we are now introducing a **contract**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other player(s).
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So, for every player who chooses A0, they get +4, and this 4 is taken from the opponent. But since the payment is **drawn equally from the other players**, and there's only one other player, that means:

- If Player 1 chooses A0, they get +4, and Player 2 loses 4.
- If Player 2 chooses A0, they get +4, and Player 1 loses 4.
- If both choose A0: each gains +4 → but wait, does that mean each gets +4 from the other?

Wait: “drawn equally from the other players” → so if both players choose A0, each is paid 4 from the other player.

So total transfer:
- Player 1: +4 from Player 2
- Player 2: +4 from Player 1

So net: each gains 4.

Similarly:
- Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets +4, Player 2 gets 0 → so Player 1 gains 4, Player 2 loses 4.
- Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets +4 → so Player 1 loses 4, Player 2 gains 4.
- Both choose A1: no changes.

So the **contract modifies the payoffs**.

We must recompute the payoff matrix **under the contract**, assuming the contract is signed by both players (so it's active).

But note: the contract only becomes active **if all players sign it**. You are deciding whether to sign, and the other player may or may not sign. But the contract is already proposed and approved via voting (assumed passed by Player 2), but we don’t know if Player 2 will sign. But for the contract to be active, **you must sign it and the other player must sign it**.

But the question says:
> "The contract becomes active only if all players sign it."

So your decision to sign is conditional: if you sign, the contract is active **only if both sign**.

But you are deciding whether to sign, **given** that the contract was approved (by Player 2). However, you do not know whether Player 2 will sign — but since the contract requires mutual agreement, and you are the one deciding whether to sign, you must consider whether signing is beneficial **if the other player also signs**.

But the key is: you can only benefit from the contract if both sign. So your expected utility from signing depends on whether you expect the other player to sign.

But the problem does **not** give us any information about Player 2’s preferences or likelihood of signing. The contract was *proposed* by Player 2 and passed via approval voting — so **Player 2 has already indicated approval** (i.e., support), but that doesn’t mean they’ll sign.

Wait — the phrase "**approved via approval voting**" probably means that the contract was proposed and passed, so Player 2 **supports it**, so likely will sign.

Moreover, since this is a decision-making game, and all players must sign for it to be active, and you are deciding whether to sign, and the game is symmetric in a way, but **you are Player 1**, and the contract was proposed by Player 2.

But to make progress, we have to assume that **if you sign, Player 2 will also sign**, because they already approved it. (Otherwise, we can’t compute expected value, since we don’t know their strategy.)

Given the context — "contract was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)" — it’s reasonable to assume that **both players are committed to signing** if you do, or alternatively, we can assume that **if you sign, the contract will be active**, because Player 2 already approved it.

But the rule says: "The contract becomes active only if all players sign it."

So to be safe, we must assume that **your signing is necessary**, and **Player 2’s signing is also necessary**.

But since they approved it, and you’re deciding, we can assume they will sign **only if you do**, or perhaps they will sign regardless.

But the problem doesn’t specify.

However, **you are deciding whether to sign *now***, and the contract is not yet active. Your decision will be final.

To make a rational choice, you should consider:

- If you **sign**, the contract will be active **only if Player 2 also signs**.
- But do you believe Player 2 will sign?
- Since they proposed and approved it, it’s **very likely** they will sign if you do.

Moreover, **we are told to make a decision based on the game** — and the contract is already in place; we just need to decide whether to sign.

Given that, and since the other player is likely to sign (they proposed and approved it), we can assume that **if you sign, the contract becomes active**.

So we proceed under the assumption that **if you sign, the contract is active and binding**.

(Otherwise, if you sign but the other doesn’t, the contract is not active — so your decision only matters if both sign — but since Player 2 has already shown support, we assume they will sign if you do.)

Thus, analyze the game **under the contract**, assuming both sign and the contract is active.

---

### **Step 3: Compute the modified payoff matrix with the contract**

Let’s compute the **new payoffs** when the contract is active.

The contract adds:
- +4 to any player who chooses A0, paid for by the other player.
- No extra for A1.

So the total payoff for each player is:

Original payoff + (4 if they chose A0, and it's drawn from the other player)

Let’s define the new payoff matrix:

#### Case 1: You choose A0, other chooses A0

- Original: you get 5, other gets 5
- You get +4 (from contract)
- Other gets +4 (from contract)
- So your total: 5 + 4 = 9
- Other’s total: 5 + 4 = 9

Wait — but is that correct?

Let’s think: when you choose A0, you get +4 **from the other player**, regardless. Similarly for the other.

So if both choose A0:
- You gain 4 from Player 2
- Player 2 gains 4 from you
- So both get +4

So:
- Your total: 5 (base) + 4 (from contract) = 9
- Other player’s total: 5 + 4 = 9

✅

#### Case 2: You choose A0, other chooses A1

- Base: you get 0, other gets 3
- You choose A0 → get +4 from other player
- Other chooses A1 → gets no contract payment
- So you receive +4 from the other, but the other gets no payment
- So you get: 0 (base) + 4 = 4
- Other gets: 3 (base) - 4 (because you got +4 from them, i.e., they pay you)

Wait: “drawn equally from the other players” — meaning the 4 is taken from the other player(s).

So if you choose A0 and other chooses A1:
- You get +4 (from the other player)
- Other player gets 0 (from contract)
- But since you get +4, it must come from the other player → so other player loses 4

So:
- You: 0 (base) + 4 = 4
- Other: 3 (base) - 4 = -1

#### Case 3: You choose A1, other chooses A0

- Base: you get 3, other gets 0
- You choose A1 → no contract benefit
- Other chooses A0 → gets +4 (from you)
- So you lose 4, other gains 4
- You: 3 - 4 = -1
- Other: 0 + 4 = 4

#### Case 4: You choose A1, other chooses A1

- Base: both get 3
- No one chooses A0 → no contract payments
- So payoffs unchanged: 3, 3

---

### **New payoff matrix (with contract):**

| Your Action \ Other’s Action | A0 | A1 |
|------------------------------|-----|-----|
| **A0**                       | 9, 9 | 4, -1 |
| **A1**                       | -1, 4 | 3, 3 |

Now analyze this game.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the game with the contract**

We want to find the best action for you, given rational behavior.

Look for Nash equilibria.

#### Check pure strategy equilibria:

1. (A0, A0):  
   - You get 9. If you switch to A1: get -1 < 9 → no incentive.  
   - Other gets 9. If they switch to A1: get -1 < 9 → no incentive.  
   ✅ Nash equilibrium.

2. (A0, A1):  
   - You get 4. If you switch to A1: get 3 < 4 → no incentive to deviate.  
   - Other gets -1. If they switch to A0: get 9 > -1 → they **will want to deviate**.  
   ❌ Not equilibrium.

3. (A1, A0):  
   - You get -1. If you switch to A0: get 9 > -1 → you deviate.  
   ❌ Not equilibrium.

4. (A1, A1):  
   - You get 3. If you switch to A0: get 4 > 3 → you deviate.  
   ❌ Not equilibrium.

So **only pure strategy Nash equilibrium** is (A0, A0), where both get 9.

That’s much better than the original (A0,A0) which gave only 5.

Now, could there be a mixed strategy equilibrium?

But since you want to **maximize your expected payoff**, and in the only pure equilibrium both get 9, and it's stable, you can expect that if both players are rational and play Nash equilibrium, the outcome will be (A0, A0).

Even if they don’t coordinate perfectly, the incentives are now very strong to play A0.

Let’s see if you should play A0 or A1, in mixed strategies.

Compute best response.

Suppose the other player plays A0 with probability \( p \), A1 with probability \( 1-p \).

Your expected payoff from choosing A0:

- If other plays A0 (prob p): you get 9
- If other plays A1 (prob 1-p): you get 4
- So EU(A0) = 9p + 4(1-p) = 9p + 4 - 4p = 5p + 4

Your expected payoff from choosing A1:

- If other plays A0: you get -1
- If other plays A1: you get 3
- EU(A1) = -1 * p + 3 * (1-p) = -p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 4p

Now find the value of p where you are indifferent:

Set EU(A0) = EU(A1):

5p + 4 = 3 - 4p  
5p + 4p = 3 - 4  
9p = -1  
p = -1/9 → not possible (probability can’t be negative)

So EU(A0) is always greater than EU(A1) for any valid p ∈ [0,1].

Check:
- At p = 0: EU(A0) = 4, EU(A1) = 3 → A0 better
- At p = 1: EU(A0) = 9, EU(A1) = -1 → A0 better

So no matter what the other player does, **you always prefer A0**.

Thus, **A0 strictly dominates A1** in this game with the contract.

So your optimal strategy is to **choose A0 with probability 1**, and the outcome will be (A0, A0), both getting 9.

---

### **Step 5: Compare with base game without contract**

In the base game:
- There are two equilibria: (A0, A0) with 5 points, and (A1, A1) with 3 points.
- The (A0,A0) is better, but there's no guarantee you’ll reach it — unless you coordinate.
- If you play A0, and the other plays A1, you get 0 — very bad.
- But in this new game: even if other plays A1, you still get 4 (which is better than 0 in base game), and if both play A0, you get 9 (way better than 5).

So **with the contract**, you are guaranteed a better outcome: at minimum you get 4 (if other plays A1), and expected payoff is high.

In the worst case (other plays A1), you get 4 — which is **better than the base game’s worst case of 0** (when you play A0 and other plays A1).

And if both play A0, you get 9.

So **the contract improves your payoff in every scenario**.

Moreover, it shifts the equilibrium to (A0, A0) and makes it the unique dominant strategy equilibrium.

Even if the other player doesn’t cooperate perfectly, **you are better off**.

So signing the contract is **strictly beneficial**.

---

### **Step 6: Final Decision**

You are asked: **Should you sign the contract?**

Answer: **Yes**, because:

- It strictly improves your payoffs in all cases.
- It leads to a unique Nash equilibrium at (A0, A0) with 9 points.
- It makes A0 the dominant strategy.
- Even if the other player doesn’t play perfectly, your minimum payoff increases (from 0 to 4).
- The other player supported it (approved via voting), so they are likely to sign, making the contract active.

Therefore, signing is **rational and beneficial**.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game Without Contracts**

The base game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5,5    | 0,3    |
| **P1: A1**    | 3,0    | 3,3    |

This is **not** a standard coordination game like the Prisoner’s Dilemma, but let’s analyze it carefully.

Let’s compute the **Nash equilibria** in the base game.

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria?

- (A0, A0):  
  - P1: If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 5 with A0, 3 with A1 → prefers A0  
  - P2: Similarly, prefers A0 → **Nash equilibrium**

- (A1, A1):  
  - P1: If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 with A1, 0 with A0 → prefers A1  
  - P2: Similarly → **Nash equilibrium**

- (A0, A1):  
  - P1 gets 0 → wants to switch to A1 (gets 3) → not NE  
- (A1, A0):  
  - P1 gets 3 → but P2 gets 0 → P2 wants to switch to A1 (gets 3) → not NE

So **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Now, **(A0,A0)** gives both players 5, which is better than (A1,A1)’s 3.

But if one player deviates from A0 to A1 while the other plays A0, the deviator gets only 3 (vs 5), so that’s not profitable — so A0 is good.

However, **(A1,A1)** is also stable: no incentive to deviate.

So **both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are Nash equilibria**, but (A0,A0) is Pareto superior (5,5 > 3,3).

So in the base game, there’s a coordination issue: do players coordinate on (A0,A0) or accept (A1,A1)? The players may need a way to coordinate.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

- A **contract** can be proposed and **approved by both players** via **approval voting**.
- The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random** from the **set of contracts with the maximum number of approvals**.

We are **Player 1**, and we want to **maximize our expected total points**.

We must decide which contracts to approve: C1 (by P1), C2 (by P2)

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Contracts**

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
- If a player chooses A0 → no additional payment.
- If a player chooses A1 → they pay **1 point** to be distributed **equally among other players**.

Since there are 2 players, “distributed equally among the other players” means:
- If you play A1, you pay 1 point → that 1 point is split between the two players? But **only one other player**.

So, if you play A1, you pay 1 point → that **1 point goes to the other player**.

Wait: “distributed equally among the other players” → only one other player → so **you pay 1 point, and the other player receives 1 point**.

Thus:
- **If you play A1, you lose 1 point (cost), and the other player gains 1 point.**
- If you play A0, no effect.

So the **net effect**:
- Paying A1 costs you **1 point in the contract**, but your actual payoff includes the base game payoffs *and* the contract payments.

Wait — need to clarify: are the **contract payments** **added on top of the base game payoffs**?

Yes — the contract specifies "additional payments".

So total payoff = base game payoff + contract payment.

So if a player plays A1, they **lose 1 point** (because they pay 1), and the other player **gains 1 point**.

Let’s formalize.

---

### **Step 4: Revised Payoff Matrix with Contract C1**

Assume both players follow the contract.

Let’s construct the **total payoff matrix under C1**.

Note: The contract is paid **only if you choose A1**, and the payment is **1** to the other player.

So the total payoff = base payoff + contract payment.

Let’s compute all four outcomes.

#### Case 1: P1: A0, P2: A0  
- Base: (5,5)  
- Contract: neither played A1 → no payments  
- Total: (5,5)

#### Case 2: P1: A0, P2: A1  
- Base: (0,3)  
- P2 played A1 → P2 pays 1 → P1 receives 1  
- P1: 0 + 1 = 1  
- P2: 3 - 1 = 2  
- Total: (1,2)

#### Case 3: P1: A1, P2: A0  
- Base: (3,0)  
- P1 played A1 → P1 pays 1 → P2 receives 1  
- P1: 3 - 1 = 2  
- P2: 0 + 1 = 1  
- Total: (2,1)

#### Case 4: P1: A1, P2: A1  
- Base: (3,3)  
- Both played A1 → each pays 1 → each gets 1 from the other
- P1: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3
- P2: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3
- Total: (3,3)

So new payoff matrix (C1):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5,5    | 1,2    |
| **P1: A1** | 2,1    | 3,3    |

Now let’s analyze **Nash equilibria** under C1.

- (A0,A0):  
  - P1: 5 (if P2 plays A0) → if P1 switches to A1 → gets 2 → worse → won’t switch  
  - P2: same → (A0,A0) is NE

- (A1,A1):  
  - P1: 3 → if P2 plays A1, if P1 switches to A0 → gets 1 → worse → won’t switch  
  - P2: same → (A1,A1) is NE

- (A0,A1):  
  - P1 gets 1 → if switches to A1 → gets 3 → so wants to switch → not NE

- (A1,A0):  
  - P1 gets 2 → if switches to A0 → gets 5 → wants to switch → not NE

So still **two NE**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But **(A0,A0)** gives **5,5** — best possible.

Note: **P1’s payoff in (A0,A0) is 5**, same as before.

But now, if both play A1, payoff is 3, so **less attractive**? Still, (A1,A1) is NE.

But notice: under C1, playing A1 **costs you**, so it’s less attractive than before.

But since both equilibria still exist, and (A0,A0) is still a NE, maybe coordination is more likely?

But no player is forced — it depends on expectations.

But **we are trying to maximize our expected points**, so we want to pick contracts that **increase the likelihood of us getting high payoffs**, and/or improve our payoff **in equilibrium**.

Now, let’s see **what happens if we are the only one to approve the contract**? But no — the winning contract is selected **only from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So we need to consider **what contracts will get approved**, and **what the outcome will be**.

But we are choosing **which contracts to approve**, **independently**, and the contract with the most approvals wins (uniform at random among those tied for most approvals).

So we want to **maximize our expected total points**, **given** that:
- We can approve C1 and/or C2.
- Player 2 may or may not approve — but we don’t control that.
- The final contract depends on **how many approvals** each gets.
- If multiple contracts tie for maximum approvals, one is chosen uniformly at random.

But we **don’t know** Player 2’s preferences.

So we must **assume Player 2 acts to maximize their own payoff**, just like us.

So we need to **predict** how Player 2 will vote.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Player 2’s Incentives**

Player 2 is trying to **maximize their total points**.

We are analyzing **whether each contract is in Player 2’s interest**.

So let’s analyze **each contract from Player 2’s perspective**.

---

#### **Contract C1 (by P1):**

As above, payoff matrix for C1:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5,5    | 1,2    |
| **P1: A1** | 2,1    | 3,3    |

From **Player 2’s perspective**, their payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 5
- (A0,A1): 2
- (A1,A0): 1
- (A1,A1): 3

So best response?

For P2, if P1 plays A0 → P2 prefers A0 (5 > 2)  
If P1 plays A1 → P2 prefers A1 (3 > 1)

So best responses are: A0 if P1 plays A0, A1 if P1 plays A1

So **no dominance**, but **(A0,A0) and (A1,A1)** are NE — same as before.

P2 gets **5** in (A0,A0), **3** in (A1,A1)

So P2 **prefers (A0,A0)**.

But can they coordinate?

Now, **does Player 2 benefit more from C1?**

Without any contract, base game:
- (A0,A0) gives P2: 5
- (A1,A1) gives P2: 3
- So P2 also prefers (A0,A0)

So under **C1**, P2 **still gets 5 in (A0,A0)** — same as before.

But now, in (A1,A1), P2 gets **3**, same as before.

But the **cost of playing A1 is higher**, so **playing A1 is less attractive**, so **P2 is less likely to play A1**, which increases the chance of (A0,A0).

So C1 **discourages A1**, which is good for P2, since (A0,A0) is better.

So **C1 is beneficial to Player 2** (P2).

→ So **Player 2 should want to approve C1**.

But what if **other contracts exist**?

Now let's check **C2**.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
- If a player chooses A0 → no additional payment
- If a player chooses A1 → they pay **4 points**, distributed **equally among other players**

So if you play A1, you pay 4 → the other player receives 4.

So net: you lose 4, other player gains 4.

Now, let’s compute the **payoff matrix under C2**.

#### Case 1: P1: A0, P2: A0  
- Base: (5,5) → no payments → (5,5)

#### Case 2: P1: A0, P2: A1  
- Base: (0,3)
- P2 plays A1 → pays 4 → P1 gets 4
- P1: 0 + 4 = 4
- P2: 3 - 4 = -1
- Total: (4, -1)

#### Case 3: P1: A1, P2: A0  
- Base: (3,0)
- P1 plays A1 → pays 4 → P2 gets 4
- P1: 3 - 4 = -1
- P2: 0 + 4 = 4
- Total: (-1, 4)

#### Case 4: P1: A1, P2: A1  
- Base: (3,3)
- Both pay 4 → each gets 4 from the other
- P1: 3 - 4 + 4 = 3
- P2: 3 - 4 + 4 = 3
- Total: (3,3)

So payoff matrix under C2:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5,5    | 4,-1   |
| **P1: A1** | -1,4   | 3,3    |

Now analyze for **Player 2** (the proposer).

Player 2’s payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 5
- (A0,A1): -1
- (A1,A0): 4
- (A1,A1): 3

So for P2:

- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (5 > -1)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A1 (3 > 4)? Wait: A1 gives 3, A0 gives 4 → so if P1 plays A1, P2 prefers **A0** (4 > 3)

Wait: (A1,A0): P2 gets 4  
(A1,A1): P2 gets 3 → so better to play A0 if P1 plays A1

But if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 (5 > -1)

So **P2’s best response**:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 plays A0
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 plays A0

Wait — if P1 plays A1, P2 gets **4** from A0, and **3** from A1 → so prefers A0.

So **P2 always plays A0**, **regardless of P1’s action**.

That is: **A0 is a dominant strategy for P2 under C2**.

Now, what about P1?

P1’s payoffs under C2:
- (A0,A0): 5
- (A0,A1): 4
- (A1,A0): -1
- (A1,A1): 3

So if P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0 (5 > -1)  
If P2 plays A1 → P1 prefers A0 (4 > 3)

So **P1 also has dominant strategy: A0**

→ **A0 is dominant strategy for both players under C2**

So the **only Nash equilibrium is (A0,A0)**

And **both players get 5 points**, which is the best possible.

So **C2 leads to guaranteed 5,5** if both play optimally.

**This is great for both players.**

Now, from **Player 2’s perspective**:
- Without any contract, P2 can get **5** if coordination on (A0,A0), or **3** if (A1,A1)
- With **C2**, **even if they miscoordinate**, they are forced to play A0, and **cannot do worse than 5**
- In fact, **no matter what P1 does**, P2 gets **at least 4**, and **will choose A0** to get 5 or 4.

So under C2, **P2 is guaranteed a payoff of at least 4**, and in equilibrium, **gets 5**.

But wait: P2 wants to approve this contract? Only if **it improves their payoff** compared to the base game.

In the base game, P2 can get **5** in equilibrium (A0,A0) — same as under C2.

But under C2, **they are forced to play A0**, but **they wanted to play A0 anyway**, and the **risk of (A1,A1)** is removed.

But **C2 gives P2 the same best payoff (5)**, but **eliminates the bad outcome (3)**.

But is there a downside?

Wait: in the base game, if P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 5 — same as in C2.

But in C2, P2 **cannot play A1**, so they **cannot get less than 4**.

But **can they get more than 5?** No — max is 5.

So **P2 gets 5 in equilibrium under C2**, same as base game.

But **in the base game**, P2 might **fail to coordinate** on (A0,A0) and end up in (A1,A1), getting 3.

But **under C2**, that’s impossible — **they get guaranteed 5**.

So **C2 eliminates the risk of bad outcome**.

Therefore, **C2 is strictly beneficial for P2**, because:
- It guarantees at least 4
- In optimal play, gets 5
- Avoids the risk of getting 3

So **P2 should strongly prefer C2 over C1** or **no contract**.

But **C1** also discourages A1, but **does not eliminate the possibility of A1 being played**.

In C1, (A1,A1) is still a NE — both players can get 3.

In C2, (A1,A1) is not even a NE — in fact, **A0 is dominant**.

So **C2 is much stronger** at enforcing (A0,A0).

So from **P2’s point of view**, **C2 is better than C1**, and **better than no contract**.

Therefore: **Player 2 will approve C2**.

But will they approve **C1**?

C1 is **also beneficial** for P2 — it discourages A1 — but **less strong** than C2.

But since **C2 is better**, they will **prefer C2**.

But they can **approve multiple contracts**, right?

The approval voting process: each player can approve **any subset** of contracts.

So **could P2 approve both C1 and C2**?

Possibly. But we need to think: **can a player approve multiple contracts?**

The problem says: "the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So yes — **approval voting**, multiple approvals possible.

So **P2 can approve both C1 and C2**, if they believe both are beneficial.

But **why approve C1 if C2 is better**?

Because **if C2 is not selected**, C1 might be better than nothing.

But **if P2 approves both**, then both have 1 approval from P2.

But **we (P1) might also approve**.

So let’s now model **both players’ approval strategies**.

---

### **Step 6: Our (P1) Decision — Should we approve each contract?**

We want to **maximize our expected total points**.

We need to **predict** Player 2's behavior.

From above:
- **C2 is very beneficial to P2** — it **forces cooperation** and guarantees 5
- **C1 is also somewhat beneficial** — discourages A1, but not a dominant strategy
- So **P2 will definitely approve C2**

But will P2 approve **C1**?

Even if they approve C2, they might still approve C1.

But suppose there are **only C1 and C2**.

If P2 approves **C2**, and maybe also C1.

But **C1** is **less beneficial** than C2 for P2 — because under C1, P2 could still play A1 (if they want), and get 3, whereas under C2, P2 is **forced** to play A0.

But C1 is still **better than nothing**, so P2 would **still approve C1**, unless they think it’s bad.

Wait: **is C1 bad for P2**? No — in fact, under C1:
- (A0,A0): 5 (same)
- (A1,A1): 3 (same)
- But (A0,A1): P2 gets 2 (down from 3) — worse
- (A1,A0): P2 gets 1 (down from 0) — worse

So **P2 gets worse outcomes** in the mixed cases — so **C1 is worse than the base game** for P2 in some cases.

But in **equilibrium**, it’s the same: P2 gets 5 in (A0,A0), 3 in (A1,A1)

But **C1 doesn’t eliminate the risk** of (A1,A1), and **exposes P2 to worse payoffs in off-equilibrium paths**.

But **C2 eliminates all risk** — P2 gets **minimum 4**, equilibrium 5.

So **C2 is strictly better than C1 for P2**, and better than base game.

Therefore, P2 will **prefer C2** over C1.

But would P2 **approve C1**?

Possibly — if they think **C2 might fail to pass**, they might approve C1 as a backup.

But we don't know P2’s strategy.

But since **we are rational**, we should assume **P2 approves the contracts that maximize their payoff**.

But approval doesn't mean they prefer it — but we assume they approve if it **doesn’t hurt them**, or **helps**.

But **C1 helps P2** in the sense that it discourages others from playing A1, but **C2 does it more effectively**.

But **C1 is not harmful**, so P2 may still approve it.

But let’s suppose **P2 only approves C2**.

That seems reasonable.

Because:
- C2 is **strictly better** than C1 for P2 — it gives better worst-case (4 vs 1 in C1), better equilibrium payoff (5 same), better coordination.
- So **P2 has no incentive to approve C1**, since C2 is better.

Therefore, **P2 will approve C2, but not C1**, assuming they are rational.

But what if **P2 can only approve one contract**? No — approval voting allows multiple.

But **if they approve multiple**, and we approve one, then the winning contract is picked at random from those with max approvals.

So let’s consider scenarios.

We are **Player 1**, and we want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

Let’s consider our options.

**Option 1: We approve C1 only**

- P2: approves C2 only
- So:
  - C1: 1 approval (ours)
  - C2: 1 approval (P2’s)
- Both have 1 approval → max is 1 → **winning contract is chosen uniformly at random between C1 and C2**
- So each has 50% chance of being selected.

If **C1 is selected**: our total payoff → we play against P2 who is playing A0 (dominant strategy? No—under C1, A0 is not dominant, but (A0,A0) is NE—so likely they play A0)

But under C1: P2 has no dominant strategy, but (A0,A0) is NE.

Similarly, under C2: P2 plays A0.

But **we are playing the game under the selected contract**.

So:

- With 50% chance: C1 is in effect → outcome: (A0,A0) → both get 5 → **we get 5**

- With 50% chance: C2 is in effect → outcome: (A0,A0) → both get 5 → **we get 5**

In both cases, **we get 5**.

So **expected payoff: 5**

**Same with any outcome.**

But is that right?

Wait: under C1, could they play (A1,A1)? Yes, but that’s a NE — so if we both play A1, we get 3.

But **if P2 is rational**, they **prefer (A0,A0)** over (A1,A1) → 5 > 3.

So they’ll coordinate on (A0,A0) if they can.

Similarly under C2, **only (A0,A0)** is NE.

So likely, **outcome is (A0,A0) in both cases**.

So **we get 5 in both**.

So expected payoff = 5

---

**Option 2: We approve C2 only**

- We: approve C2
- P2: approves C2 (since it’s better)

Then:
- C1: 0 approvals
- C2: 2 approvals → wins

So **C2 is implemented** → outcome: (A0,A0) → we get 5

Expected payoff: 5

Same.

---

**Option 3: We approve both C1 and C2**

Now:
- C1: 1 approval (ours)
- C2: 2 approvals (P2 and us)

Max approvals: 2 → only C2 has 2 → **C2 wins** → we get 5

Still 5

---

**Option 4: We approve neither**

- C1: 0
- C2: 1 (P2)
- So C2 wins → we get 5

Again 5

So **in all cases, we get 5**?

But wait: is that true?

In Option 4: if **we approve neither**, but P2 approves C2, then C2 has 1 approval, C1 has 0 → C2 wins → (A0,A0) → we get 5

Same.

So **no matter what we do**, **as long as C2 is approved by P2**, which it will be, **C2 wins** → we get 5

But can C2 win if we don’t approve it?

Yes — if P2 approves C2, and we don’t, C2 has 1 approval, others have 0 → C2 wins.

So **P2 only needs to approve C2** to ensure its adoption.

So **we have no influence over the outcome**.

But we want to **maximize our payoff**.

And in all cases, payoff is **5**.

But what if **P2 does not approve C2**?

But we assumed **P2 is rational** — C2 is better for them.

But is it?

Wait: in **C2**, when both play A1, payoff is 3 → same as base game.

But **P2 gets 5 in (A0,A0) — same as base**.

But **P2 is protected**: even if they play A1, they get -1 in some cases — wait, in (A0,A1): P2 gets -1 → which is **worse than base game (3)**.

So is C2 **bad for P2**?

Wait! **Big mistake here**.

In C2: when P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → P2 gets **-1**

But in **base game**, if P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → P2 gets **3**

So **P2 gets -1 vs 3** → much worse.

But in **C2**, **P2 playing A1 is very bad** if P1 plays A0.

But P2 knows this — so **P2 would never play A1**?

But earlier I said **A0 is dominant**, because if P1 plays A1, P2 playing A0 gives 4, playing A1 gives 3 → so prefers A0.

And if P1 plays A0, playing A0 gives 5, playing A1 gives -1 → so also prefers A0.

So **A0 is dominant** → so P2 **will always play A0**.

So even though playing A1 gives -1 in some cases, **P2 never does it**, because A0 is dominant.

So **P2 never plays A1**.

So the **bad outcome (A0,A1) never happens**.

So P2 **is safe**.

So **C2 is fine** — they are guaranteed to get **at least 4 or 5**, and **get 5 in equilibrium**.

So **C2 is beneficial**.

So P2 will approve C2.

Similarly, **we (P1)**: in C2, A0 is also dominant.

So **we will get 5 in all cases**.

So **no risk**.

Therefore, **C2 leads to 5 for us**.

But now, what about C1?

In C1, we also get 5 in (A0,A0), but if we were to miscoordinate, we could get less.

But under C1, **(A1,A1) is a NE**, so if P2 plays A1, we might play A1 and get 3.

But with C2, **that cannot happen**.

So **C2 is superior**.

But since **no matter what we do**, **C2 will win if P2 approves it**, which they will, **we get 5 anyway**.

But is there a scenario where we get **more than 5**?

No — 5 is the maximum.

But could we get **less than 5**?

Only if **C2 doesn't win**.

But if we **approve C2**, it increases its chances.

But even if we don’t, as long as P2 approves it, it wins.

So we get 5 regardless.

But what if **P2 does not approve C2**?

Then C2 has 0 approvals.

But why would P2 not approve it?

Because **C2 is better**, so they will.

Unless they are not rational.

So assuming rationality, P2 approves C2.

Now, **should we approve C2**?

Yes — because it helps ensure C2 wins.

But suppose we **don’t approve C2**, but P2 does — C2 wins — we get 5.

Same as if we approve it.

But **if we approve C2**, then C2 has at least 1 vote — but P2 might approve it anyway.

But what if P2 does **not** approve C2?

Then C2 has 0 approvals.

But P2 is rational — so they **will** approve C2.

So P2 will approve C2.

Therefore, **C2 will win no matter what**.

So our choice **doesn't matter**.

But wait: suppose **P2 approves C2**, but we approve **neither** — C2 has 1 approval — wins.

If we approve C2, C2 has 2 — wins.

Same outcome.

But what if **P2 does not approve C2**?

Then C2 has 0.

But P2 is rational: C2 is better for them — they will approve it.

Unless there is a reason.

But is there a downside?

One issue: in C2, if both play A1, we get 3 — same as base.

But **P2 gets 3** anyway.

But the risk of getting -1 in (A0,A1) is **eliminated** because P2 never plays A1.

So **P2 is protected**.

So **P2 will approve C2**.

So C2 will win.

Therefore, **we are guaranteed to get 5**.

So our approval choice doesn’t affect outcome.

But the question is: **should we approve the contracts?**

But we might want to **avoid risk**, so approving C2 is good.

But **C1**: is it bad?

C1 is less good than C2.

But if we approve C1, and P2 approves C2, then both have approvals, but C2 wins.

No harm.

But **C1 might be harmful if it were selected**, but it’s not.

But we want to **maximize our expected points**, and **C2 is better**, so we should approve C2.

But **approving C1** doesn’t hurt.

But is there any advantage to disapproving C1?

Not really.

But let’s consider: **what if we approve C1 but not C2**?

Then:
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 1 (P2’s)
- Max approvals: 1 → winner chosen at random between C1 and C2 → each 50% chance.

If C1 is chosen: we get 5 (if (A0,A0) plays)

If C2 is chosen: we get 5

Still 5.

So no difference.

But if we do not approve C2, and P2 approves C2, C2 wins.

So it’s fine.

But to ensure C2 wins, we should approve C2.

But even if we don’t, it wins.

So **our approval of C2 is redundant**.

But is there any reason to **not** approve C2?

Only if we are **worried** about the risk, but there is none.

Wait: in **C1**, if it were selected, but it won't be.

But we can **approve both** to be safe.

But no benefit.

But final thought: **C1 is bad for P2**, but P2 won’t approve it, so it won’t win anyway.

But we are Player 1.

But in C1, we get 5, same as C2.

But **C1 allows (A1,A1)**, which gives us 3.

But under rational play, we go to (A0,A0) — so no problem.

But is it possible that under C1, we get less?

Only if coordination fails.

But under C2, no failure.

But since **C2 will win anyway**, it doesn’t matter.

Therefore, to **maximize chance of good outcome**, we should **approve C2**.

And **approve C1 as well**? But no benefit.

But the question is: do we approve each?

Final decision:

- **C1**: proposed by us — it’s better than no contract, but less than C2. But since C2 will win, approving C1 doesn’t hurt, and might help if C2 is not approved. But P2 will approve C2.

But to be safe, we should approve C2.

And approving C1 is not harmful.

But is C1 bad for us?

In C1, if we play A1, we pay 1, so we lose 1.

But we won’t play A1.

So no issue.

But **C2 is better**.

But since we are trying to maximize our payoff, and **C2 ensures 5**, we should approve C2.

Approving C1 is not necessary.

But we are allowed to.

But there’s no downside.

So we can approve both.

But the safest is to **approve C2**, and **not approve C1**, because C1 is weaker.

But C1 might be approved by P2, but P2 won’t approve it.

But our choice: we want to **maximize our expected points**.

Let’s suppose:
- If we **approve C2**, then C2 has at least 1 approval, and P2 will approve it → C2 wins → we get 5

- If we **don’t approve C2**, but P2 does, C2 wins → we get 5

So same.

But if P2 does not approve C2, then C2 wins only if we approve it.

But P2 is rational — so we assume they do approve C2.

So no difference.

Therefore, we can **approve C2** to increase its chance of winning, but it doesn’t matter.

But to be conservative, and since C2 is better, we should **approve C2**.

For C1: it’s less effective, and might be seen as a lesser option.

But since it’s not harmful, and P2 won’t approve it anyway, it doesn’t matter.

But the final answer: we want to maximize our points.

After all analysis, **C2 is the best**.

So we should approve C2.

For C1: if we approve it, and C2 is not approved, C1 might win, but C2 will be approved.

So approving C1 is redundant.

But we can approve it.

But to reduce noise, perhaps approve only C2.

But there’s no harm in approving both.

But since the question doesn’t penalize approvals, we can approve both.

But let’s go with logic.

Final decision:

- **C1**: we are the proposer. The contract is weak, and C2 is better. We should approve C2 to ensure good outcome. Approving C1 is not harmful, but not necessary. But since it might help in case P2 doesn't approve C2 (though they will), but to be safe, we approve both.

But wait: **if we approve C1, and P2 approves C2, C2 wins anyway**, so it’s fine.

But we are not required to approve only the best.

So to be safe, approve C2.

And approve C1? Only if it helps.

But it doesn’t.

But there’s no cost.

In fact, if we approve both, then if by chance C1 wins (say, if C2 has 1, C1 has 2), but only if we approve and P2 does.

But P2 won’t approve C1.

So C1 will have only 1 (ours), C2 has 2 (P2 and us) → C2 wins.

So no problem.

So we can approve both.

But since the game is symmetric, and we want to maximize, and C2 is better, we should **approve C2**.

For C1, it’s okay to approve it, but not necessary.

But let’s see: what if we do not approve C1?

Then C1 has 0 approvals if P2 doesn't, which they won't.

So C1 won't win.

No problem.

So our decision:

- **C1**: false (we don't need to approve it, since C2 is better)
- **C2**: true (to ensure it wins)

But we are trying to maximize, and approving C2 is good.

But is C1 bad? No.

But since it's less good, and we can't get more than 5, and C2 gives 5, we should approve C2.

Final answer:

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

But wait: if we approve C2, and P2 approves C2, C2 wins.

If we don't, C2 wins.

So we can do either.

But to be safe, we approve C2.

But is there any scenario where not approving C2 is better?

No.

So we should approve C2.

For C1, not necessary.

But let’s consider: if we approve C1, and P2 doesn't approve C2, then C1 might win.

But P2 will approve C2.

So it’s not necessary.

So we can go with:

{"C1": false, "C2": true} 

But to be safe: approve C2.

Yes.

However, there is one more point: **the payment in C1 is only 1**, while in C2 it's 4.

C2 is stronger.

So we should not approve C1.

Final decision:

{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break this down step by step, carefully considering the game, the payoffs, the contract, and the strategic implications.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game Without the Contract**

The base payoff matrix (as described, with me as **Player 2**, and the other player as **Player 1**) is:

|          | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | 5, 5  | 0, 3  |
| **P2 A1** | 3, 0  | 3, 3  |

So, when both play A0: both get 5  
P2 A0, P1 A1: P2 gets 0, P1 gets 3  
P2 A1, P1 A0: P2 gets 3, P1 gets 0  
Both A1: both get 3

This is a variant of a coordination game, but not symmetric in payoffs unless we factor in the contract.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Payment Contract**

The contract states:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of **4 points**, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

**Key implications:**
- The 4 points **are taken from the other player(s)**.
- Since there are two players, if **I choose A0**, I get +4, and the **other player loses 4**.
- Similarly, if the other player chooses A0, they get +4, and I lose 4.
- If **both** choose A0, then:
  - I gain +4 (from my A0)
  - But lose 4 (because P1 chose A0, so I pay 4)
  - Net: 0 from contract
- If only I choose A0, and P1 chooses A1:
  - I get +4 (from my A0)
  - P1 gets 0 (since they chose A1)
  - So I gain 4, P1 loses 0? Wait — no.

Be careful: **"drawn equally from the other players"** — so if **only I choose A0**, then the 4 points come from the other player (P1). So:
- I gain +4
- P1 loses 4

Similarly, if only P1 chooses A0, then P1 gains +4, I lose 4.

If both choose A0:
- I gain +4 (from my A0), but lose 4 (because P1 chose A0)
- Net: 0
- Same for P1: +4 from own choice, -4 from other’s choice → net 0

If both choose A1:
- No one gets anything → net 0

So, the **contract adds net 0** to both players if both choose A0, but if only one chooses A0, that player gains 4, and the other loses 4.

This changes the effective payoffs.

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Effective Payoffs with the Contract**

We now update the payoff matrix to include both the original game payoffs **and** the contract payments.

Let’s define the **total points** I (Player 2) get in each scenario:

#### Case 1: I choose A0, P1 chooses A0
- Base payoff: 5 (from game)
- Contract: I gain +4 (I chose A0), but lose 4 (P1 chose A0) → net 0
- **Total for me: 5 + 0 = 5**

Same for P1: 5 + 0 = 5

#### Case 2: I choose A0, P1 chooses A1
- Base payoff: 0 (from game)
- Contract: I gain +4 (I chose A0), P1 chose A1 → so P1 doesn’t affect me, I don’t lose anything
- So I get +4 from contract
- **Total for me: 0 + 4 = 4**

P1: base payoff = 3, contract: chose A1 → no effect → total 3

#### Case 3: I choose A1, P1 chooses A0
- Base payoff: 3
- Contract: I chose A1 → no gain; P1 chose A0 → so I lose 4
- **Total for me: 3 - 4 = -1**

P1: base = 5, contract: +4 (P1 chose A0), but I chose A1 → no cost to P1 → total 5 + 4 = 9

Wait: Let's recheck contract wording:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if P1 chooses A0, **P1 gets +4**, and the **other player (me)** loses 4.

Yes.

So:
- When P1 chooses A0, **I lose 4**, regardless of my choice.
- When I choose A0, **I gain 4**, regardless of P1's choice.

So in this case:
- I choose A1, P1 chooses A0
- Base: I get 3
- Contract: I lose 4 → total: 3 - 4 = -1

P1 gets: base = 5, plus +4 (from A0) → 9

#### Case 4: I choose A1, P1 chooses A1
- Base: 3
- Contract: no one chose A0 → so no extra points
- Total for me: 3

P1: base 3, contract: 0 → 3

---

### **Updated Payoff Matrix (Player 2's perspective)**

|          | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | 5     | 4     |
| **P2 A1** | -1    | 3     |

So now, **Player 2 (me)** faces this payoff matrix.

Let’s find the best strategy.

---

### **Step 4: Game Theory — Find Nash Equilibrium (Mixed Strategy)**

We need to find the probability distribution over A0 and A1 for **me** that maximizes my expected payoff, assuming the other player is also rational and will play optimally.

Let:
- Let **p** = probability that **P1 chooses A0**
- Then, probability P1 chooses A1 = 1 - p

My expected payoff if I play A0:
- With probability p: I get 5
- With probability 1 - p: I get 4
- So E[A0] = 5p + 4(1 - p) = 5p + 4 - 4p = p + 4

My expected payoff if I play A1:
- With probability p: I get -1
- With probability 1 - p: I get 3
- So E[A1] = -1·p + 3(1 - p) = -p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 4p

Now, to find **my best response**, I compare E[A0] and E[A1].

Set E[A0] = E[A1] to find indifference point (for the other player’s optimal p):

p + 4 = 3 - 4p  
p + 4p = 3 - 4  
5p = -1  
p = -0.2

Wait — **p = -0.2**? That’s impossible (probability can't be negative).

This implies that **E[A0] > E[A1] for all valid p in [0,1]**

Let’s test:

At p = 0 (P1 always chooses A1):
- E[A0] = 0 + 4 = 4
- E[A1] = 3 - 0 = 3 → A0 better

At p = 1 (P1 always chooses A0):
- E[A0] = 1 + 4 = 5
- E[A1] = 3 - 4 = -1 → A0 much better

At p = 0.5:
- E[A0] = 0.5 + 4 = 4.5
- E[A1] = 3 - 2 = 1 → still A0 better

So **A0 is always strictly better than A1**, for any p ∈ [0,1].

Therefore, **no matter what P1 does, I should always choose A0?**

Wait — but that seems too strong. Let's double-check.

Wait — we’re playing a **simultaneous game**, and both of us are choosing probabilities.

But the question is: **I want to maximize my expected payoff**, assuming the other player may also use a strategy.

But from my perspective, **A0 dominates A1**, because for any p, E[A0] > E[A1].

So **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy** for me (Player 2).

Thus, I should **always choose A0**.

But let’s consider: what does the other player do?

If **I** always play A0 (i.e., 100% A0), then P1 sees:
- If P1 plays A0: gets 5 (base) + 4 (from A0) = 9
- If P1 plays A1: gets 3 (base) + 0 (no A0) = 3

So P1 will also prefer A0 (9 > 3)

So if **I** play A0 with 100%, **P1 also plays A0**

Then final outcome: both A0 → I get 5 (from game) + 0 (contract: +4 for me, -4 for P1 → net 0) → total 5

Is that the best I can do?

Wait — suppose **I play A0 with probability 1**, and P1 plays A0 with probability 1 → I get 5

But what if I **could make P1 play A1**, and I play A0?

Then:
- I play A0, P1 plays A1 → I get 0 (game) + 4 (contract) = 4

But 4 < 5 → worse

So I'd rather have P1 play A0 than A1, **if I play A0**

But if I play A1, what happens?

If I play A1:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 3 - 4 = -1
- If P1 plays A1: I get 3

So I only get 3 if P1 plays A1

But if P1 is rational, they’ll prefer A0 (since as we saw, for P1, A0 gives higher payoff regardless of my action — let's check that)

Let’s check **P1’s incentives**:

P1’s payoff matrix (from their own view):

|          | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | 5+4 = 9 | 5+4 = 9 |
| **P1 A1** | 3+0 = 3 | 3+0 = 3 |

Wait — no: **P1's payoffs depend on whether I choose A0 or A1**

Let’s redo P1’s payoffs *with contract effects*:

#### P1 chooses A0:
- If P2 chooses A0: base = 5, contract: P1 gets +4 → total = 9
- If P2 chooses A1: base = 0, contract: P1 gets +4 → total = 4

#### P1 chooses A1:
- If P2 chooses A0: base = 3, contract: 0 → total = 3
- If P2 chooses A1: base = 3, contract: 0 → total = 3

So P1’s matrix is:

|          | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | 9     | 4     |
| **P1 A1** | 3     | 3     |

So P1 **always prefers A0**, because:
- Against A0: 9 > 3
- Against A1: 4 > 3

So **A0 is strictly dominant for P1 too**

Therefore, **no matter what I do, P1 will choose A0** (since it's dominant)

Thus, **in equilibrium, P1 plays A0 with probability 1**

So **I know that P1 will play A0 for sure**

Given that, what should **I** do?

I compute my expected payoff:

- If I play A0: get 5 (base) + 0 (contract net) = 5
- If I play A1: get 3 (base) - 4 (contract: P1 chose A0, so I lose 4) = -1

So I prefer A0 → 5 > -1

Therefore, **optimal strategy is to play A0 with probability 100%**

---

### **Final Check: Is There Any Incentive to Randomize?**

No. A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → I should never play A1.

And I know P1 is playing A0 for sure due to dominance.

So even in mixed strategies, since A0 dominates A1 for both players, **the unique Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**

Thus, I should play A0 with 100% probability.

---

response:
Let's analyze this game step by step, carefully considering the original payoff structure, the impact of the proposed contract, and whether signing it would be beneficial for *you* (Player 1) in maximizing your expected points.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without contract)

The original payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| A0                  | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| A1                  | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

This is a coordination game with a conflict of interest over A0 (both prefer to coordinate on A0, but Player 1 gets more from A0, and Player 2 gets more from A1 when not coordinated).

But note: if both players choose A0, both get 5. If they choose different actions, Player 2 gets 3 and Player 1 gets 0 (if Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1). If both choose A1, both get 3.

So from a selfish perspective, if you are Player 1:
- A0 is best when Player 2 chooses A0 (5 points).
- A0 is worst when Player 2 chooses A1 (0 points).
- A1 gives you 3 regardless of Player 2's choice (since (3,0) and (3,3) both give you 3).

So for Player 1, **A1 dominates A0** because no matter what Player 2 does, A1 gives at least 3, and A0 gives only 0 or 5. But it's risky: if Player 2 chooses A0, you get 0.

So in the original game, Player 1's optimal pure strategy is A1 (since it guarantees 3, while A0 risks 0). However, if both players are rational and expect the other to play A1, or if they can coordinate, A0 might be better.

But without a contract, and assuming no communication, what’s the Nash equilibrium?

Let’s compute mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- p = probability Player 1 plays A0
- q = probability Player 2 plays A0

Player 1’s expected payoff:

- If Player 1 plays A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- If Player 1 plays A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

Player 1 is indifferent when 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So Player 1 should mix with p such that Player 2 is indifferent.

Player 2’s expected payoff:

- If Player 2 plays A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
- If Player 2 plays A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5

So the mixed Nash equilibrium is: both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

Expected payoff for Player 1:

= p * [5q + 0(1−q)] + (1−p) * [3q + 3(1−q)]
= (0.6)(5×0.6) + (0.4)(3)
= 0.6×3 + 0.4×3
= 1.8 + 1.2 = 3

So in the mixed equilibrium, Player 1 gets 3.

Alternatively, if Player 1 plays A1 for sure, they always get 3, regardless of Player 2. So **3 is the best guaranteed payoff**.

So in baseline: Player 1's best strategy is to play A1 (pure), leading to 3 points guaranteed.

But now we have a **contract**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract is proposed by Player 2 and approved via voting. It says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, **drawn equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, **distributed equally among the other players**.

Important: This is a **self-enforcing** contract only if *all players sign*. Since it says "the contract becomes active only if all players sign it", and you are deciding whether to sign, the contract is only active if *you* sign *and* Player 2 signs.

But Player 2 proposed it, so likely they will sign — but you must decide whether to sign it.

Now, the contract is **not** about changing the original payoffs — it's an added **side payment**, paid by or to the player based on their action.

Let’s decode how this affects payoffs **when the contract is active**.

Assume you both sign — so the contract is active.

Now, for any player choosing A0: they get +2 points, but those 2 points are **drawn equally from the other players**.

Since there are 2 players, "drawn equally from the other players" → each other player pays 1 point.

Similarly, if a player chooses A1: they pay 2 points, which are split equally among the other players → each other player gets +1 point.

So:

> **If you play A0:**
> - You get +2 from the contract.
> - Player 2 (the other player) pays you 2 → so you get +2, Player 2 loses 2.
>
> **If you play A1:**
> - You pay 2 → so you get -2 from contract.
> - Player 2 gains +1 (since the 2 is split equally among others; only one other player).
> - So Player 2 gains +1, you lose 2.

But note: **this is per player**. So the contract changes the effective payoffs.

Let’s write the **new payoff matrix under the contract**, assuming both players sign (so it’s active).

Now, for each action pair, we add the contract payments.

Let’s compute the total payoff for Player 1 and Player 2 in each case.

#### Case 1: Both play A0

- Original payoff: (5, 5)
- Contract: both play A0 → both get +2
- So contract effect: Player 1 gets +2, Player 2 gets +2
- Total: (5+2, 5+2) = **(7, 7)**

#### Case 2: Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 plays A1

- Original: (0, 3)
- Contract:
  - Player 1 plays A0 → gets +2
  - Player 2 plays A1 → pays -2 → so gets -2
  - But contract payments must be distributed: Player 1 (A0) gets +2 → paid by Player 2
  - Player 2 (A1) pays -2 → paid to Player 1 → so Player 1 gets +2 from that
  - So net:
    - Player 1: 0 (original) + 2 (contract) = 2
    - Player 2: 3 (original) - 2 (contract) = 1
- Total: **(2, 1)**

Wait — let’s clarify: The contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So **when a player chooses A0**, they get +2, and that 2 is taken from the other players.

> "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players."

So when a player chooses A1, they pay -2, and that -2 is split equally among other players.

So in this case: Player 1 → A0 → gets +2 from contract
Player 2 → A1 → pays -2 → so the -2 is split among other players (only one other: Player 1), so Player 1 gets +1 from that.

Wait — this is ambiguous.

"drawn equally from the other players" — so if someone chooses A0, the +2 is extracted from *other players equally*.

So if two players: each of the others pays 1.

Similarly, if a player chooses A1, they pay 2 → split equally among others → each other player gets +1.

So:

- Player 1 chooses A0 → gets +2, so Player 2 pays 1 (since only one other player).
- Player 2 chooses A1 → pays -2 → so Player 1 gets +1.

So total contract payments to Player 1: +2 (from being A0) +1 (from Player 2 being A1) = +3
Player 2: -1 (from being A0) -2 (from being A1) = -3? Wait — no.

Wait: the contract is applied per player.

So the amount is determined per player’s action, regardless of what others do.

So:

- When Player 1 chooses A0: Player 1 gets +2 from the contract.
  - That +2 is paid by the other players — so Player 2 loses 2 (i.e., pays 1 to Player 1, since only one other player).

- When Player 2 chooses A1: Player 2 pays -2 from the contract.
  - That -2 is split equally among the other players → so Player 1 gets +1.

So net for Player 1: +2 (from A0) +1 (from Player 2’s A1) = +3
Net for Player 2: -2 (from A1) -1 (from Player 1’s A0) = -3? Wait — that doesn't balance.

Wait: total contract payments should balance.

Let’s define the total transfer:
- Player 1 plays A0 → contract gives +2 to Player 1 → so Player 2 loses 2.
- Player 2 plays A1 → contract takes -2 from Player 2 → that -2 is distributed to others → so Player 1 gains +1 from that.

So total:
- Player 1 gains: +2 (from own A0) +1 (from Player 2’s A1) = +3
- Player 2 loses: -2 (from own A1) -1 (from Player 1’s A0) = -3

But total change: 0 → good. So net: Player 1 gains 3, Player 2 loses 3 — this matches.

So yes, the contract system redistributes money — but only based on actions.

So the **contract-induced transfer** is not symmetric — it depends on what each player does.

So in this case: (A0, A1)

- Original: Player 1: 0, Player 2: 3
- Contract transfer: Player 1 gains +3, Player 2 loses +3 → so Player 2 gets 3 - 3 = 0? Wait no:

Wait: the contract is **additional** to the original payoff — so we **add** the contract effects.

So Player 1’s total payoff = original + contract gain
Player 2’s total = original + contract gain

Contract gain for Player 1:
- From A0: +2
- From Player 2’s A1: +1
- → total: +3

Contract gain for Player 2:
- From A0: +2 → but Player 1 did A0 → so Player 2’s contract gain = +2 only if Player 2 plays A0 → but Player 2 plays A1, so no +2.
- From Player 1’s A0: Player 2 pays → so Player 2 loses 1 (since the 2 is split — only one other player)
- From Player 2’s A1: Player 2 loses 2 (because they pay 2)
- So total contract gain for Player 2: -1 (from Player 1's A0) -2 (from own A1) = -3

So:
- Player 1: 0 + 3 = 3
- Player 2: 3 + (-3) = 0

Wait — but Player 1 should not get +3, because the contract payments are only +2 from their own A0, and +1 from Player 2’s A1 — that's correct.

So total payoff:
- (3, 0)

But let’s recompute for all cases — carefully.

---

### Full Contract Payoff Matrix (when both sign the contract)

Let’s label:

- Player 1’s action → A0 or A1
- Player 2’s action → A0 or A1

#### Case 1: P1=A0, P2=A0

- Original: (5,5)
- Contract:
  - P1: plays A0 → gets +2 → so P2 pays -2
  - P2: plays A0 → gets +2 → so P1 pays -2
  - So net:
    - P1: +2 -2 = 0
    - P2: +2 -2 = 0
- Total: (5+0, 5+0) = **(5,5)**

Wait — that can’t be right. If both play A0, each gets +2 from the contract, but each must pay 2 to the other? That cancels.

So contract effect: each gains 2, but each loses 2 → net 0.

So original payoff unchanged.

So: **(5,5)**

#### Case 2: P1=A0, P2=A1

- Original: (0,3)
- Contract:
  - P1: plays A0 → gets +2
  - P1: P2 plays A1 → so P1 gets +1 from the 2 that P2 pays
  - So P1 contract gain: +2 +1 = +3
  - P2: plays A1 → pays -2
  - P2: P1 plays A0 → so P2 loses -1 (because P1's A0 causes P2 to pay 1)
  - So P2 contract gain: -2 -1 = -3
- Total: P1 = 0 + 3 = **3**, P2 = 3 - 3 = **0**

→ (3, 0)

#### Case 3: P1=A1, P2=A0

- Original: (3,0)
- Contract:
  - P1: plays A1 → pays -2 (loses 2)
  - P1: P2 plays A0 → so P1 gets +1 (from P2’s A0)
  - So contract gain for P1: -2 +1 = -1
  - P2: plays A0 → gets +2
  - P2: P1 plays A1 → so P2 loses 1 (because P1’s A1 causes P2 to pay 1)
  - So P2 contract gain: +2 -1 = +1
- Total: P1 = 3 -1 = **2**, P2 = 0 +1 = **1**

→ (2,1)

#### Case 4: P1=A1, P2=A1

- Original: (3,3)
- Contract:
  - P1: plays A1 → pays -2
  - P1: P2 plays A1 → so P1 gets +1 (from P2’s A1 payment)
  - So P1 contract gain: -2 +1 = -1
  - P2: plays A1 → pays -2
  - P2: P1 plays A1 → so P2 gets +1
  - So P2 contract gain: -2 +1 = -1
- Total: P1 = 3 -1 = **2**, P2 = 3 -1 = **2**

→ (2, 2)

So the **new game with contract** (assuming both sign) has payoff matrix:

| P1\P2 | A0       | A1       |
|-------|----------|----------|
| A0    | (5, 5)   | (3, 0)   |
| A1    | (2, 1)   | (2, 2)   |

Now, let's analyze this **new game**.

Your goal is to maximize your expected payoff as Player 1.

Let’s see what Player 1’s best strategy is.

Check pure strategies:

- If you play A0:
  - If P2 plays A0 → you get 5
  - If P2 plays A1 → you get 3
  - So min: 3, max: 5

- If you play A1:
  - If P2 plays A0 → you get 2
  - If P2 plays A1 → you get 2
  - So always 2

So A0 is better in both cases: 5 vs 2 (if P2 plays A0), 3 vs 2 (if P2 plays A1).

So **A0 dominates A1** for Player 1 in the contract game.

So if the contract is active, you should play A0 for sure.

Now, what does Player 2 do?

Player 2’s payoffs:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 5
  - If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 1
  - So average depends on P1

- If P2 plays A1:
  - If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 0
  - If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 2

So P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 only if P1 mixes strategically.

But if you play A0 for sure (best for you), then P2’s options:
- A0 → gets 5
- A1 → gets 0
→ so P2 prefers A0.

So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium in the contract game.

In fact, it’s a strict equilibrium: both get 5 > others.

So if both sign the contract, the outcome will likely be (A0, A0), with payoffs (5,5).

But wait — is that a Nash equilibrium?

Check:

- P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 5 for A0, 2 for A1 → so prefers A0
- P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 5 for A0, 0 for A1 → so prefers A0

Yes — (A0, A0) is a strict Nash equilibrium.

So in the contract game, both players playing A0 is stable.

So **if the contract is active**, you can expect to get **5 points**.

But wait — is that correct?

Yes. In the contract game, (A0, A0) gives (5,5) — and it's a Nash equilibrium.

So if both sign and play rationally, you get 5.

Now — compare to **not signing the contract**.

Without the contract:
- The original game: best for you is to play A1 → you get 3 guaranteed
- Or mixed strategies: expected 3 (as computed earlier)
- But you can always get 3 by playing A1
- You cannot guarantee more than 3 without coordination

With the contract, you can get **5** (if both play A0).

But — **only if the contract is active**, which requires **both** to sign.

You are deciding whether to sign.

Player 2 proposed it — so they probably want it to be active.

But they might be irrational? Unlikely — assume rational.

If you sign, and Player 2 signs, then both get 5 (in equilibrium).

But what if you sign, and Player 2 does not? Then the contract is not active.

So the outcome reverts to original game.

But since Player 2 proposed the contract, and you are only deciding whether to sign, Player 2 might not sign if you don't.

But you don’t know — but **if you sign**, and Player 2 does not, contract inactive → back to original game.

Now, if you don’t sign, contract inactive → original game, you get at most 3 (by playing A1).

But if you sign, and Player 2 signs, you get 5.

So is it worth risking?

But consider: **if you sign, will Player 2 sign?**

Since Player 2 proposed it, they likely **want it to be active**.

So if you sign, Player 2 is likely to sign (since they proposed it), and thus the contract activates.

So **if you sign**, it’s very likely that both sign, and the outcome is (A0, A0), giving you 5.

But wait — could Player 2 be strategic?

Let’s see: in the contract game, if Player 2 signs, and you sign, they get 5.

If Player 2 doesn’t sign, then contract inactive → original game.

In original game, if you play A1 (as rational), and Player 2 plays A1 (since A1 gives 3 guaranteed), then they get 3.

So if Player 2 doesn’t sign, you play A1, they play A1 → payoff (3,3)

If they do sign, and you do, they get 5.

So Player 2 **strongly prefers** to sign, since 5 > 3.

Similarly, you get 5 > 3.

So **both players have an incentive to sign** — it’s a coordination mechanism that leads to a better outcome for both.

So if Player 2 proposed it, it’s because they benefit.

So **if you sign, it’s very likely Player 2 will sign too**, because it benefits them.

Thus, **if you sign, the contract becomes active**, and you end up in (A0, A0), getting 5.

If you don’t sign, contract inactive → you get at most 3.

So **signing gives you 5 vs 3**.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

But wait — what if Player 2 is irrational? But we assume rationality.

Also, the contract is only active if *all* sign — so you’re not forced.

But since you benefit from signing (and so does Player 2), and it leads to a better outcome, it’s optimal.

But let’s confirm: in the contract game, if you play A0, and Player 2 plays A0, you get 5 — better than 3.

And in the original game, you only get 3.

So the **expected gain from signing is positive**, assuming Player 2 signs.

And since Player 2 benefits from signing (they go from 3 to 5), they will sign.

Therefore, you should sign.

But one more concern: what if you sign, but Player 2 doesn’t? Then contract inactive → you’re back to original game.

But you can still play A1 → get 3.

But if you don’t sign, you’re also in original game → get 3.

So in **both cases** (signing and not signing), if the contract is inactive, you get 3.

The difference is only if contract is active.

And if you sign, and Player 2 signs → you get 5.

If you don’t sign → contract inactive → you get 3.

So the only risk is that Player 2 doesn’t sign — but since they gain from signing, they will.

Therefore, **signing is safe and beneficial**.

Thus, **you should sign**.

Final answer: sign = true

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we first analyze the game's payoff matrix and its equilibria without the contract.

**1. Original Game Analysis:**
The payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) are as follows:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

There are two Nash Equilibria in this game:
- **(A0, A0)** giving (5, 5)
- **(A1, A1)** giving (3, 3)

Although (A0, A0) is pareto-superior (offering 5 points to each instead of 3), (A1, A1) is the **risk-dominant** equilibrium. If a player is uncertain about the other's choice (e.g., assigning a 50% probability to each action), they will choose A1 because the expected payoff for A1 (1.5) is higher than for A0 (2.5? No, let's re-calculate: $0.5 \times 5 + 0.5 \times 0 = 2.5$ for A0 vs. $0.5 \times 3 + 0.5 \times 3 = 3$ for A1). Thus, players often coordinate on the less rewarding (3, 3) outcome to avoid the risk of receiving 0.

**2. Contract Analysis:**
The contract stipulates that if a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point to the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** No payments. Payoff: (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** Player 2 plays A1 and pays 1 to Player 1. Payoff: (0+1, 3-1) = (1, 2)
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 plays A1 and pays 1 to Player 2. Payoff: (3-1, 0+1) = (2, 1)
- **(A1, A1):** Both pay 1 and receive 1. Payoff: (3, 3)

**3. Comparison:**
Under the contract, the Nash Equilibria remain (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). However, the risk-dominance shifts:
- For (A0, A0), the product of deviation losses is $(5-2) \times (5-2) = 9$.
- For (A1, A1), the product of deviation losses is $(3-1) \times (3-1) = 4$.

Now, **(A0, A0)** is the risk-dominant equilibrium. Choosing A0 is now the "safer" move (expected payoff with 50/50 split is $0.5 \times 5 + 0.5 \times 1 = 3$ for A0 vs. $0.5 \times 2 + 0.5 \times 3 = 2.5$ for A1).

**Conclusion:**
Signing the contract makes it more likely that both players will coordinate on the higher-paying (5, 5) equilibrium. Since Player 1 proposed this contract, they are highly likely to sign it, ensuring its activation. This coordinates both players toward the optimal result.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy in this game, we need to weigh the payoffs and the additional payment contract for each of our potential actions, considering both our own and the other player's decisions. Let's break down the possible scenarios to understand the revised payoffs including the additional contract:

### Scenarios:

1. **You choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:**

   - Base game payoff:
     - You: 5 points
     - Player 1: 5 points

   - Contract payment:
     - You receive 2 points deducted from Player 1.
     - Player 1 receives 2 points from you.

   - Final payoff:
     - You: \(5 + 2 = 7\) points
     - Player 1: \(5 - 2 = 3\) points

2. **You choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:**

   - Base game payoff:
     - You: 0 points
     - Player 1: 3 points

   - Contract payment:
     - You receive 2 points deducted from Player 1.
     - Player 1 pays 2 points to you.

   - Final payoff:
     - You: \(0 + 2 = 2\) points
     - Player 1: \(3 - 2 = 1\) points

3. **You choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:**

   - Base game payoff:
     - You: 3 points
     - Player 1: 0 points

   - Contract payment:
     - You pay 2 points to Player 1.
     - Player 1 receives 2 points from you.

   - Final payoff:
     - You: \(3 - 2 = 1\) points
     - Player 1: \(0 + 2 = 2\) points

4. **You choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:**

   - Base game payoff:
     - You: 3 points
     - Player 1: 3 points

   - Contract payment:
     - You pay 2 points to Player 1.
     - Player 1 pays 2 points to you.

   - Final payoff:
     - You: \(3 - 2 + 2 = 3\) points
     - Player 1: \(3 - 2 + 2 = 3\) points

### Summary of Final Payoffs:

- **(You: A0, Player 1: A0)** = (You: 7, Player 1: 3)
- **(You: A0, Player 1: A1)** = (You: 2, Player 1: 1)
- **(You: A1, Player 1: A0)** = (You: 1, Player 1: 2)
- **(You: A1, Player 1: A1)** = (You: 3, Player 1: 3)

### Strategy Analysis:
To maximize our points, it's important to consider the average expected payoffs by selecting a probability distribution over A0 and A1. However, given the substantial impact of the contract:
- **A0 results in higher points when Player 1 also picks A0**.
- **A0 results in a tie if Player 1 plays less optimally and picks A1**.
- **A1 is generally less beneficial unless both players pick A1**.

Empirically:
- **Encouraging Player 1 to pick A0** by picking A0 ourselves turns out to be more lucrative.

To potentially leverage equilibrium strategies:
- Let’s assume other players act rationally; since A0 benefits you more:
  - **If Player 1 predicts your A0: They might choose A1 to push you towards A0 which ultimately benefits them less effectively.**

Given the high reward scenarios (You: A0, both play rationally), running a pure (or near) A0 makes sense:
 
### Final Decision:
Given best possible assumptions drawn:
 {"A0": 100, "A1": 0} 

This JSON distribution maximizes alignment with above detailed outcome predictions based on how close A0 likely encourages  highest returns from potential multiple rounds based on rational choices.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):
```
                Player 1
              A0      A1
Player 2  A0   5       0
          A1   3       3
```

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 points
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 points

There's also a mixed strategy equilibrium. Let me find my expected payoff there:
- If Player 1 plays A0 with probability q: My payoff from A0 is 5q, from A1 is 3
- Setting these equal: 5q = 3, so q = 3/5

At the mixed equilibrium (both play A0 with probability 3/5):
- My expected payoff = (3/5)×(3/5)×5 + (3/5)×(2/5)×0 + (2/5)×(3/5)×3 + (2/5)×(2/5)×3 = 3 points

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

With the contract, if a player chooses A1, they pay 4 points to the other player.

New payoff matrix (my payoff, Player 1's payoff):
```
                Player 1
              A0          A1
Player 2  A0  5           4 (I get 0+4 from their payment)
          A1  -1          3 (payments cancel: 3-4+4)
```

## Step 3: Check for dominant strategies with contract

For me:
- Against A0: I get 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1 → A0 is better
- Against A1: I get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → A0 is better

**A0 is now a strictly dominant strategy for me!** The same logic applies to Player 1.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: Mixed strategy equilibrium gives me 3 points expected, with risk of coordination failure
- **With contract**: Dominant strategy equilibrium (A0, A0) guarantees me 5 points

## Conclusion

The contract eliminates the inferior equilibrium and coordination risk, guaranteeing the best outcome for both players. I should definitely sign it.

response:
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

We have a two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

This is similar to a coordination game with some mixed incentives.

Note:
- If both choose A0: both get 5.
- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0.
- If both choose A1: both get 3.

So, A0 is better when both choose it, but if you're alone choosing A0 while others choose A1, you lose out.

---

### **Step 2: Incorporate the Contract**

The contract says:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other players.

Important implications:
- For **each player who chooses A0**, they gain **+4 points**.
- This 4 points is **drawn equally from the other players**.

Since there are two players, if **one player chooses A0**, they get +4, which must come from the other player — so the other player loses 4 points.

But if **both choose A0**, then:
- Each gets +4 (from the contract).
- The total extra 8 points needed comes from the other player — so the other player is penalized by 4, but since both are getting +4, and total 8 points are transferred *from the other player*, that would imply the other player loses 8?

Wait — need to be careful here.

### Interpretation of "drawn equally from the other players"

Let’s parse:  
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- For **each** player who chooses A0, they get +4.
- That +4 is **drawn from the other players**, **equally**.

So suppose **Player 1 chooses A0**, Player 2 chooses A0:
- Player 1 gets +4 → must be drawn from Player 2 → Player 2 loses 4.
- Player 2 gets +4 → must be drawn from Player 1 → Player 1 loses 4.
- So net: Player 1 gains 4 - 4 = 0
- Player 2 gains 4 - 4 = 0
→ Net transfer: 0. So both get +4, but both pay 4 → net +0 from contract.

Now suppose **only Player 1 chooses A0**, Player 2 chooses A1:
- Player 1 gets +4 → drawn "equally from the other players".
- There is only one other player (P2), so P2 pays 4.
- Player 2 does not choose A0, so receives no money, and is not required to pay extra.
→ So P1: +4, P2: -4

Similarly, if only Player 2 chooses A0:
- P2 gets +4, P1 pays 4.

Now suppose **both choose A1**:
- Neither gets any contract payment.
- So no transfer.

So summarizing the **contract effect**:

| P1 choice | P2 choice | P1 contract gain | P2 contract gain |
|----------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| A0       | A0       | +4 - 4 = 0       | +4 - 4 = 0       |
| A0       | A1       | +4               | -4               |
| A1       | A0       | -4               | +4               |
| A1       | A1       | 0                | 0                |

So the contract **introduces net transfers**:
- If both choose A0 → no contract net effect.
- If only one chooses A0 → that player gets +4, the other loses 4.
- Both A1 → nothing.

---

### **Step 3: Combine Base Payoffs with Contract Payoffs**

Let’s now compute total payoff (base + contract) for Player 1 in each scenario.

#### Case 1: P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A0

- Base: (5, 5)
- Contract: P1: +0, P2: 0
- Total P1 payoff: 5

#### Case 2: P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1

- Base: (0, 3)
- Contract: P1: +4, P2: -4
- Total P1 payoff: 0 + 4 = **4**

#### Case 3: P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0

- Base: (3, 0)
- Contract: P1: -4, P2: +4
- Total P1 payoff: 3 - 4 = **-1**

#### Case 4: P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A1

- Base: (3, 3)
- Contract: 0
- Total P1 payoff: 3

So the **full payoff matrix for Player 1** is:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5      | 4      |
| **P1: A1** | -1     | 3      |

Ah! This is critical. The contract has drastically changed the game.

Now, for P1:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - A0 gives 5
  - A1 gives -1 → so A0 is better.
- If P2 plays A1:
  - A0 gives 4
  - A1 gives 3 → so A0 is still better.

So **no matter what P2 does**, A0 gives P1 more than A1.

So A0 **dominates** A1 for Player 1?

Wait — let's confirm:
- Against A0: 5 > -1 → A0 better
- Against A1: 4 > 3 → A0 better

Yes! **A0 is strictly dominant** for Player 1.

So regardless of what P2 does, P1 should always choose A0.

But the game involves **simultaneous** choices and **probabilistic strategies**.

However, since A0 dominates A1, **the optimal pure strategy for P1 is to choose A0 with 100% probability**.

But wait — is this still true if P2 is also rational?

Let’s think from P2’s perspective — but the problem says: **You are playing as Player 1** and want to **maximize your own total points**.

So we can assume P2 is also rational, and will play optimally from their perspective.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** of this game, given the contract.

But the question asks for **your** action distribution, i.e., what **you** (Player 1) should do to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming P2 may also be optimizing.

So let’s check P2’s incentives.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze P2’s Payoffs**

We need to compute P2's total payoff (base + contract).

#### Case 1: P1: A0, P2: A0

- Base: 5
- Contract: P2 receives +4, but pays 4 (to P1) → net 0
- Total: 5 + 0 = 5

#### Case 2: P1: A0, P2: A1

- Base: 3
- P2 did not choose A0 → no +4
- But P2 is the only other player, so when P1 chose A0, P2 must pay 4
- So P2 gets: 3 - 4 = -1

#### Case 3: P1: A1, P2: A0

- Base: 0
- P2 chooses A0 → gets +4
- P2 pays 4 to P1 (since P1 chose A1, not A0 → no cost to P1, but P2’s A0 payment is drawn from P1)
- So P2: 0 + 4 - 4 = 0? Wait.

Let’s re-analyze contract for P2.

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive +4, drawn equally from the other players."

So when P2 chooses A0, they get +4 from the contract.

This +4 must be **drawn equally from the other players**.

Other player is P1.

So if P2 chooses A0, P1 must pay 4.

Yes.

So back to case:
- P1: A1, P2: A0
- Base: P2 gets 0
- Contract: P2 gets +4
- But this +4 is drawn from P1 → so P1 loses 4
- So P2 total: 0 + 4 = 4

Wait! This is different.

Contract effect: **when P2 chooses A0**, P2 gets +4 **from the other player(s)** — so P1 pays 4.

But if P1 chooses A1, P1 is not choosing A0, so doesn’t pay — but still, **only the other player (P1) is available**.

So the +4 for P2 comes from P1.

So P2 gets +4, P1 loses 4.

But P1 didn’t choose A0, so P1 isn’t being punished for choosing A0.

The contract doesn’t say you pay if you don’t choose A0 — only that **if you choose A0, you get +4 from others**.

So **only the payer is determined by who chooses A0**.

Let’s clarify:

- Each person who chooses A0 **gets +4**.
- For each such person, that +4 is **drawn equally from the other player(s)**.

So:

- If P2 chooses A0, P2 gets +4 → must come from P1 → P1 pays 4.
- If P1 chooses A0, P1 gets +4 → must come from P2 → P2 pays 4.

So the contract transfers money **based on who chooses A0**, regardless of what the other does.

So for P2’s payoff:

#### Case 1: P1: A0, P2: A0

- P2 gets: base 5 + contract +4, and P2 *pays* 4 (because P1 is other player and chose A0) → net contract: 0
- Total: 5

#### Case 2: P1: A0, P2: A1

- P2 chooses A1 → no +4 from contract
- But P1 chose A0 → so P2 **must pay 4**
- Base: 3
- So total: 3 - 4 = -1

#### Case 3: P1: A1, P2: A0

- P2 chooses A0 → gets +4
- P1 did **not** choose A0 → so P1 pays 0
- So P2 gets +4, and no payment to others → so +4
- Base: 0
- Total: 0 + 4 = 4

#### Case 4: P1: A1, P2: A1

- No one chooses A0 → no contract payments
- Base: 3
- Total: 3

So P2's total payoff matrix:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5      | -1     |
| **P1: A1** | 4      | 3      |

Now, from **P2’s perspective**:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (5 > -1)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A0 (4 > 3)

So **A0 dominates A1 for P2 as well**!

Because:
- Against A0: 5 > -1 → prefer A0
- Against A1: 4 > 3 → prefer A0

So both players have **A0 as strictly dominant**.

Therefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is **both play A0 with 100% probability**.

No matter what the other does, each player is better off playing A0.

---

### **Step 5: What should you (Player 1) do?**

Since A0 is dominant, you should choose A0 with 100% probability.

This gives you the maximum payoff regardless of what P2 does.

Expected payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: 5
- If P2 plays A1: 4
- Since P2 will play A0 (because it’s dominant), your payoff is 5.

Even if P2 were to randomize, you are still better off playing A0.

Suppose P2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with 1-q.

Then your expected payoff from:

- Choosing A0: 5*q + 4*(1-q) = 5q + 4 - 4q = q + 4
- Choosing A1: (-1)*q + 3*(1-q) = -q + 3 - 3q = 3 - 4q

Compare: A0 gives q + 4, A1 gives 3 - 4q

Set q + 4 > 3 - 4q → 5q > -1 → always true for q ≥ 0

So A0 is always better.

Therefore, **you should choose A0 with 100% probability**.

response:
Let's analyze this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

The game is a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (for Player 1, you) is:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                          | 5        | 0        |
| **A1**                          | 3        | 3        |

From Player 1's perspective:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → 5
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → 0
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → 3
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → 3

This is **not** a standard prisoner's dilemma, but it has some similarities.

Let’s compute best responses:

- If opponent plays A0: you prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If opponent plays A1: you are indifferent (0 vs 3 → you prefer A1)

So your best response depends on the opponent's action.

Now, let's look for Nash equilibria.

Try pure strategy equilibria:

1. (A0, A0):  
   - You get 5. If you deviate to A1: get 3 < 5 → no incentive.  
   - Opponent: if they deviate to A1, they get 3 < 5 → no incentive.  
   → **Nash equilibrium**

2. (A1, A1):  
   - You get 3. Deviate to A0: get 0 < 3 → no incentive.  
   - Opponent: same, no incentive.  
   → **Nash equilibrium**

3. (A0, A1):  
   - You get 0. Deviate to A1: get 3 > 0 → want to deviate → not equilibrium.

4. (A1, A0):  
   - You get 3. Deviate to A0: get 5 > 3 → want to deviate → not equilibrium.

So there are **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

There may also be a mixed strategy equilibrium, but we’ll consider that later.

Now, if both players are rational and anticipate each other, they might coordinate on (A0, A0) because it gives 5 each, which is better than 3 each in (A1, A1). But without communication, coordination failure is possible.

---

### **Step 2: Consider the Contract**

The contract is proposed by Player 1 (you), and it says:

> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payment.
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 1 point **to the other player(s)**.

Since there are two players, if you play A1, you **pay 1 point to the other player**.

> Note: "distributed equally among the other players" → since there's only one other player, they get 1 point.

So, effectively:
- If you play A1, you **lose 1 extra point**, and the opponent **gains 1 extra point**.
- If you play A0, nothing changes.

So the **contract modifies the payoffs**.

We need to know: **Do you want to sign the contract?**  
But the contract is **only active if both players sign**.

So: **If you sign, then the contract applies only if the other player also signs.**  
If you do **not** sign, the contract is **not active**, and the base game applies.

Your goal is to **maximize your expected total points**.

So we must ask: **Does signing the contract increase your expected payoff, given that you are rational, and the other player is rational?**

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Contract’s Effect on Payoffs**

Let’s recompute the payoff matrix **with the contract active**.

Let’s assume both players signed → contract applies.

Now for each combination:

| Your Action | Opponent’s Action | Base Payoff (You) | Contract Adjustment | Total Payoff (You) |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 5                 | 0                   | **5**              |
| A0          | A1                | 0                 | 0 (you didn’t play A1) | **0**           |
| A1          | A0                | 3                 | -1 (you pay 1)      | **2**              |
| A1          | A1                | 3                 | -1 (you pay 1)      | **2**              |

Wait: when you play A1, you pay 1 point to the opponent → your payoff decreases by 1.

But when opponent plays A1, they also pay 1 to you → so **you gain 1** in that case.

So let’s do it carefully.

The contract: if **you** play A1 → you pay 1 → your payoff goes down by 1.

If **opponent** plays A1 → they pay 1 to you → your payoff goes up by 1.

So the total effect on your payoff, if both play A1:
- Base: 3
- You play A1 → lose 1
- Opponent plays A1 → you gain 1
→ Net: 3 - 1 + 1 = **3**

Wait — that’s different from above.

Let me clarify: the contract says:
> "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players."

So **each** player who plays A1 pays 1 point to the **other player(s)**.

In a two-player game:
- If you play A1 → you pay 1 point to the opponent.
- If opponent plays A1 → opponent pays 1 point to you.

So for the outcome (A1, A1):
- You play A1 → you lose 1 → -1
- Opponent plays A1 → you gain 1 → +1
→ Net: 0
- Base payoff: 3
→ Final: 3 + 0 = **3**

Similarly:
- (A1, A0):
  - You play A1 → lose 1
  - Opponent plays A0 → no payment to you
  → Net: -1
  - Base: 3
  → Final: 3 - 1 = **2**

- (A0, A1):
  - You play A0 → no payment from you
  - Opponent plays A1 → opponent pays 1 to you → you gain 1
  - Base: 0
  → Final: 0 + 1 = **1**

- (A0, A0):
  - No A1 played → no payments
  - Base: 5
  → Final: **5**

So the **contracted payoff matrix** (for you) is:

| Your Action \ Opponent | A0       | A1       |
|------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                | 5        | **1**    |
| **A1**                | 2        | **3**    |

Now, let’s analyze this modified game.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the Modified Game (With Contract Active)**

We now find best responses.

For you (Player 1), given opponent’s strategy:

- If opponent plays A0: your payoffs are A0 → 5, A1 → 2 → so you prefer A0.
- If opponent plays A1: your payoffs are A0 → 1, A1 → 3 → so you prefer A1.

So best responses:
- If opponent A0 → A0
- If opponent A1 → A1

Now, **pure strategy Nash equilibria** in this modified game:

1. (A0, A0):
   - You: 5, deviate to A1 → 2 < 5 → no incentive
   - Opponent: same → no incentive
   → **Nash equilibrium**

2. (A1, A1):
   - You: 3, deviate to A0 → 1 < 3 → no incentive
   - Opponent: same → no incentive
   → **Nash equilibrium**

3. (A0, A1):
   - You: 1 → if you deviate to A1: 3 > 1 → want to deviate → not equilibrium

4. (A1, A0):
   - You: 2 → deviate to A0: 5 > 2 → want to deviate → not equilibrium

So two pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Now, compare to original game.

In original game, (A0,A0) gave 5 each, (A1,A1) gave 3 each.

In the **contracted game**, (A0,A0) still gives 5 each, and (A1,A1) gives 3 each.

So the **payoff structure is unchanged** in terms of coordination, but the **incentives are different**.

Wait — let's compute what the **expected payoff is in equilibrium**, especially under plausible assumptions.

But in both games, there are two equilibria: one efficient (A0,A0), one inefficient (A1,A1).

Now, **what is the effect of the contract?**

In the **original game**, (A0,A0) is a better equilibrium (5 vs 3).

But is there a reason to expect players to coordinate on (A0,A0)? Possibly, but it depends on trust.

But now consider: **does the contract make cooperation more likely?**

Let’s look at **expected coordination**.

Suppose both players are rational and believe that the other will play A0.

In original game: if you believe opponent plays A0, you should play A0 (5 > 3), so you do.

In contracted game: same → A0 is better → same incentive.

If both believe opponent plays A1:
- Original: you get 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefer A1
- Contracted: you get 1 for A0, 3 for A1 → still prefer A1

So **the best response functions are identical** — the incentives to play A0 or A1 depend on the opponent’s play in the same way.

But now, **what is the difference?**

Let’s look at **incentives to play A1**.

In original game:
- If opponent plays A0: playing A1 gives 3 vs 5 → not worth it
- If opponent plays A1: playing A1 gives 3 vs 0 → worth it

In contracted game:
- If opponent plays A0: playing A1 gives 2 vs 5 → even worse
- If opponent plays A1: playing A1 gives 3 vs 1 → still better than A0 (3 > 1)

So **the cost of playing A1 is now higher** when the opponent plays A0.

That is: **you are now punished more** for choosing A1 when the other plays A0.

In the original game, playing A1 when opponent plays A0 gives you 3.

In the contracted game, it gives you only 2.

So **the penalty for unilateral A1 is increased?** Actually, not really — it's a **cost** to choosing A1 regardless.

But here’s the **key insight**:

- In the **original game**, A1 is **not punished** when you play it and opponent plays A0 — you get 3.
- In the **contracted game**, playing A1 when opponent plays A0 gives you only 2 — less.

So you **lose 1 point** for choosing A1 unilaterally, because you pay 1 point to the other player (who is not paying you back).

So **A1 has a higher cost when the other player plays A0**.

This **reduces the temptation to play A1** if you think the other player might play A0.

But in the (A0,A0) equilibrium, this helps **maintain cooperation**.

But more importantly: **does the contract make (A0,A0) more stable?**

Suppose players are unsure and might play mixed strategies.

Let’s consider the **mixed strategy equilibrium** in both games.

---

### **Step 5: Mixed Strategy Analysis (Optional but Informative)**

Let’s find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in the **original game**.

Let p = probability that opponent plays A0.

Then your expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p  
Your expected payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So in mixed strategy equilibrium, opponent plays A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

Then your own strategy: you mix such that opponent is indifferent.

Let q = your probability of A0.

Opponent's payoff from A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q  
From A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 0.6

So symmetric mixed strategy NE: both play A0 with 0.6

Expected payoff: for you: 5 * 0.6 * 0.6 + 0 * 0.6 * 0.4 + 3 * 0.4 * 0.6 + 3 * 0.4 * 0.4  
= 5 * 0.36 + 0 + 3 * 0.24 + 3 * 0.16  
= 1.8 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

Now, in the **contracted game**, let’s find mixed strategy equilibrium.

Use the **contracted payoff matrix**:

|         | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **A0** | 5        | 1        |
| **A1** | 2        | 3        |

Let q = probability you play A0.

Opponent’s expected payoff from playing A0: 5q + 2(1-q) = 5q + 2 - 2q = 3q + 2  
From playing A1: 1q + 3(1-q) = q + 3 - 3q = -2q + 3

Set equal: 3q + 2 = -2q + 3  
5q = 1 → q = 0.2

So in mixed strategy NE, you play A0 with 0.2, A1 with 0.8.

Now, your expected payoff:
- If opponent plays A0 with prob p, you get:
  - A0: 5p + 1(1-p) = 5p + 1 - p = 4p + 1
  - A1: 2p + 3(1-p) = 2p + 3 - 3p = -p + 3

At equilibrium, opponent plays p such that you are indifferent → so p = ?

Better: compute expected payoff for you when both play mixed strategy.

You play A0 with 0.2, A1 with 0.8  
Opponent plays A0 with p, A1 with 1-p

You: expected payoff =  
(0.2)(p)(5) + (0.2)(1-p)(1) + (0.8)(p)(2) + (0.8)(1-p)(3)  
= 0.2p(5) + 0.2(1-p)(1) + 0.8p(2) + 0.8(1-p)(3)  
= 1.0p + 0.2 - 0.2p + 1.6p + 2.4 - 2.4p  
= (1.0 - 0.2 + 1.6 - 2.4)p + (0.2 + 2.4)  
= (0.0p) + 2.6  
= **2.6**

Wait — that can't be. We should get the same result symmetrically.

But let’s double-check:

- (A0, A0): probability 0.2 * p → payoff 5
- (A0, A1): 0.2 * (1-p) → payoff 1
- (A1, A0): 0.8 * p → payoff 2
- (A1, A1): 0.8 * (1-p) → payoff 3

So your expected payoff:  
5*(0.2p) + 1*(0.2(1-p)) + 2*(0.8p) + 3*(0.8(1-p))  
= 1.0p + 0.2 - 0.2p + 1.6p + 2.4 - 2.4p  
= (1.0 - 0.2 + 1.6 - 2.4)p + (0.2 + 2.4)  
= (0.0p) + 2.6 → **2.6**

But in the original game, expected payoff in mixed NE was **3.0**

So in the **contracted game**, the mixed strategy NE gives you only **2.6** — lower than 3.0.

Moreover, the pure strategy equilibria are still (A0,A0) with 5, (A1,A1) with 3.

Now: **if both players believe the other will play A0**, then in the original game, you play A0 → get 5.

In the contracted game, same → play A0 → get 5.

But **if one player deviates**, the punishment is higher in the contracted game.

For example, suppose the other player plays A0. In original game, you get 3 for playing A1. In contracted game, you get only 2.

So **you have less incentive to defect** when the other plays A0.

Therefore, the contract **makes playing A0 more attractive** relative to A1, especially when you suspect the other player might play A0.

In other words, **the contract reduces the temptation to play A1** when the other player is playing A0 — which is exactly the situation where cooperation is most at risk.

So it **makes coordination on (A0,A0) more stable**.

Moreover, in the **contracted game**, the **mixed strategy equilibrium gives you lower expected payoff** (2.6 vs 3.0), so if players are rational and use mixed strategies, you do worse.

But **if players can coordinate on (A0,A0)**, you get 5 in both cases.

However, **if coordination fails**, and players end up in (A1,A1), you get 3 in both cases.

So the **contract does not hurt you in the good equilibrium**, and **lowers your payoff if mixed strategies are played**.

But the **main gain** is **reduced risk of coordination failure**.

But here’s the **critical point**: **you are the proposer of the contract.**

And the contract **only applies if both sign**.

So if you sign, and the other player signs, the contract applies → payoffs are as above.

But if you sign, and the other player **does not**, then **no contract** → original game.

Now, you must ask: **Is signing the contract beneficial?**

Let’s consider the **other player’s incentives** to sign.

The contract benefits you (the proposer) by making (A0,A0) more stable, but **does it benefit the other player?**

Let’s check.

If the other player signs, they face the same payoff changes:

- When they play A1 and you play A0 → they lose 1 (because they pay 1 to you)
- When they play A1 and you play A1 → they receive 1 (you pay 1), and they pay 1 → net 0

In the modified game:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A1, A0): 0 → you play A1, they play A0 → they get 0, you pay 1 → they lose 1 → but they play A0 → so they get 0 - ? Wait:

Let’s compute from **opponent’s perspective** if contract is active.

Opponent’s payoffs:

- (A0, A0): 5
- (A1, A0): You play A1 → you pay 1 → opponent receives 1 → so opponent gets 0 + 1 = 1
- (A0, A1): Opponent plays A1 → they pay 1 to you → so they lose 1 → base is 3 → so 3 - 1 = 2? Wait.

In (A0, A1): you play A0 → no payment, opponent plays A1 → they pay 1 to you → so opponent’s total payoff: 3 (base) - 1 = **2**

Wait — in original, (A0, A1): opponent gets 3

Now, with contract: opponent plays A1 → pays 1 → so gets 3 - 1 = **2**

But you (Player 1) get: base 0 + 1 (from opponent’s payment) = 1

Similarly:
- (A1, A1): both pay each other → net 0 → base 3 → so each gets 3
- (A1, A0): opponent plays A0 → you play A1 → you pay 1 to opponent → opponent gets 0 (base) + 1 = 1

So opponent’s payoff matrix:

| Your A | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| A0     | 5           | 2           |
| A1     | 1           | 3           |

So opponent has:
- If you play A0: prefers A0 (5 > 1)
- If you play A1: prefers A0 (2 > 1) → no, 2 > 1 → so prefers A0

Wait:
- If you play A1, opponent gets: A0 → 1, A1 → 3 → so prefers A1

So opposite of you.

But importantly: **opponent is **worse off** in the A1-A0 case**, and **better off in A0-A1**.

But in any case: the contract **reduces the payoff of players who play A1 unilaterally**.

For opponent:
- When they play A1 and you play A0: they get 2 instead of 3
- When they play A1 and you play A1: they get 3 (same)

So **they are worse off if they play A1 when you play A0**

So **the contract makes A1 less attractive** for the opponent when they think you might play A0.

But **why would the opponent want to sign?**

If they sign, they are worse off in the case where you play A0 and they play A1 (lose 1 instead of gain 1), but better off if you play A1 and they play A0 (get 1 instead of 0).

But their expected payoff depends on beliefs.

However, from the opponent’s perspective: **the contract imposes a cost on them for playing A1, regardless of your action**.

So they are more likely to avoid A1.

But **they don’t gain from the contract**, in expectation — in fact, they might lose.

For example, suppose they think you play A0 with high probability.

Then if they play A1, they get 2 (with contract) vs 3 (without) → worse.

So they are **worse off** if the contract is in place, **if they are likely to be the one who plays A1 when you play A0**.

The contract **makes playing A1 more costly** for both players.

So **the opponent has no incentive to sign** — because if they sign, they lose potential payoff.

In fact, if the contract is in place, they are **worse off** whenever they choose A1.

But you, as proposer, **benefit from the contract** because it makes them less likely to deviate.

But here’s the catch: **the contract only applies if both sign**.

So if you sign, but the other player refuses, then no contract → original game.

But if you **do not sign**, then no contract regardless → original game.

So your choice: sign or not.

If you sign, **and the other signs**, then the **contracted game applies**: your payoff may be higher if coordination on (A0,A0) happens.

If the other **does not sign**, then **no contract**, same as not signing.

But you **can only benefit if the other also signs**.

So the key is: **will the other player sign?**

Given the contract, the other player’s payoffs are **worse** in the (A1, A0) case (from 3 to 2) and better in (A0, A1) case (from 0 to 1), but they also lose in (A1, A1) (they don’t gain anything there — it's 3 both ways). Wait no: (A1, A1) is same as before — 3.

So:
- (A0, A0): 5 → same
- (A1, A0): opponent gets 2 vs 3 → **worse**
- (A0, A1): opponent gets 1 vs 0 → **better**
- (A1, A1): 3 vs 3 → same

So opponent **gains only in (A0, A1)**, loses in (A1, A0).

But they are **risk-averse to A1** — because even if they play A1 and you play A0, they lose 1, but if you play A1, they gain 1 but also lose 1 → net 0.

But in **expected value**, if they believe you are playing A0 with high probability, they lose by signing.

Therefore, **the other player has no incentive to sign the contract** — because it **reduces their payoff when they are deviating (playing A1) while you play A0** — which is the worst scenario for them (getting 3 instead of 2).

So they will **not sign**.

Therefore, **even if you sign, the contract will not be active**.

Hence, signing **gives you no benefit and costs you nothing**, but **you are not the only one needed to make it active**.

So if you sign, and they don’t, same as not signing.

But if they don’t, they are not harmed by not signing — they are happy not to be bound by the contract.

So it is **rational for them to reject** the contract.

Therefore, **the contract will not be activated if you sign**.

Hence, **you get the same outcome whether you sign or not** — the game proceeds under original rules.

So **signing has no benefit** — it doesn’t change the outcome, and you risk being worse off if the other player changes their behavior.

But since the other player will likely reject, you lose nothing by not signing.

But more importantly: **you have no way to enforce or guarantee that the other player will sign** — and they have **no incentive to sign**.

Therefore, **you should not sign**.

But wait — **what if the other player is altruistic?** But the game assumes rational players maximizing their own points.

So they will not sign.

### **Final Decision**

- Signing will not activate the contract (because other player won’t sign).
- Therefore, your expected payoff is unchanged.
- But you are not worse off.
- However, you have no gain.
- And you risk being in a situation where the contract might not help.

But since the contract gives you **no advantage** (because it won’t be enacted), and you get no benefit, **you should not sign**.

Wait — is that correct?

Actually: **if you sign, you don’t lose anything.** The contract only applies if both sign.

So signing doesn’t hurt you — it’s just a commitment.

But if the other player signs, you benefit — but they won’t sign.

So the only way to benefit is if they sign, but they have no incentive.

So **no gain**.

But **there is no cost** to signing, so why not sign?

But wait: **signing is a strategic move**. If you sign, it signals willingness to commit.

But the other player knows that signing hurts them (they are worse off in some cases), so they will refuse.

So signaling doesn’t help.

Moreover, if you **don’t sign**, you can still get the same outcome.

But here’s a key point: **if you sign, and the other player also signs, you get better incentives for (A0, A0)**.

But since the other player **won’t sign**, you **never get the benefit**.

Therefore, **signing is useless** in practice.

Thus, **you should not sign**, because it provides no benefit and serves no purpose.

But to be precise: **the contract is only active if all players sign**.

You are Player 1.

If you sign, and the other player does not, the contract is not active.

So your payoff is the same as without signing.

Therefore: **signing has no effect unless the other signs**, which they won’t.

So **there is no reason to sign**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

response:
Let's analyze the game step by step to determine the optimal probability distribution for Player 1 (you), given the payoff structure and that the contract is not active (since Player 2 rejected it).

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

We are Player 1. The other player is Player 2.

The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                        | 5, 5     | 0, 3     |
| **A1**                        | 3, 0     | 3, 3     |

So:
- If both play A0 → (5, 5)
- You A0, Opponent A1 → (0, 3)
- You A1, Opponent A0 → (3, 0)
- Both A1 → (3, 3)

---

### Step 2: Analyze Strategic Incentives

This is a symmetric-looking game, but not quite symmetric in payoffs.

Let’s think about dominant strategies.

Check if **A0** is dominant for you:
- If opponent plays A0: you get 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → better to play A0
- If opponent plays A1: you get 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → better to play A1

So A0 is not dominant.

Check if **A1** is dominant:
- Opponent A0: you get 3 (A1) vs 5 (A0) → worse
- Opponent A1: you get 3 (A1) vs 0 (A1)? Wait, if you play A1 and opponent A1, you get 3. If you play A0 and opponent A1, you get 0. So in this case, A1 is better.

So: A1 is better only when opponent plays A1. But when opponent plays A0, A0 is better.

So **no dominant strategy**.

---

### Step 3: Look for Nash Equilibrium (NE)

We want to find a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- You (Player 1) play A0 with probability **p**
- Opponent (Player 2) play A0 with probability **q**

We need to find **p** such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1, **and** such that **q** makes you indifferent.

But since we are choosing **p** (your strategy), and the opponent is a rational player, we must assume they will play the best response to our strategy.

But in the absence of communication, the best approach is to find the **Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies**.

Let’s compute the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

---

### Step 4: Find Mixed Strategy NE

Let’s suppose Player 2 chooses A0 with probability **q**, A1 with probability **1 - q**

Then your expected payoff for choosing:
- **A0**: (5)(q) + (0)(1 - q) = 5q
- **A1**: (3)(q) + (3)(1 - q) = 3q + 3(1 - q) = 3

You are indifferent between A0 and A1 when:
> 5q = 3  
> q = 3/5 = 0.6

So if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.6, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now, from Player 2’s perspective:
Let your probability of playing A0 be **p**, so A1 is (1 - p)

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - You play A0 (p): payoff = 5
  - You play A1 (1 - p): payoff = 0
  - So expected: 5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - You play A0 (p): payoff = 3
  - You play A1 (1 - p): payoff = 3
  - So expected: 3p + 3(1 - p) = 3

Player 2 is indifferent when:
> 5p = 3 ⇒ p = 3/5 = 0.6

So in the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:
- Both players play A0 with probability 0.6
- A1 with probability 0.4

This is the **only** Nash equilibrium (since no pure strategy NE exists — check below).

---

### Step 5: Check for Pure Strategy NE

Check pure strategy profiles:

1. (A0, A0): 
   - You can deviate to A1 → get 3 instead of 5? No, 3 < 5 → no incentive.
   - Opponent can deviate to A1 → get 3 instead of 5 → no incentive.
   → (A0, A0) is a candidate. But wait: if you play A0, and opponent plays A0, you get 5. If opponent switches to A1, they get 3 — so no incentive. But is that stable?

Wait — what if opponent is playing A0, and you are playing A0 — you get 5. If **you** deviate to A1, you get 3 (since opponent plays A0), which is worse. So you won't deviate.

But what if **opponent** deviates? If you play A0, opponent gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so won’t deviate.

So (A0, A0) is a **Nash equilibrium**?

But let’s check: if both play A0, and you deviate to A1 → get 3, opponent gets 0 → but you go from 5 to 3 → worse. So no incentive.

But is this really stable?

Wait — no: suppose opponent is playing A0. Then you prefer A0 (5) over A1 (3). So you won’t deviate.

If you are playing A0, opponent prefers A0 (5) over A1 (3) → so won’t deviate.

So yes, (A0, A0) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

But wait — let's check (A1, A1):
- You play A1, opponent plays A1: you get 3
- If you switch to A0, opponent still plays A1 → you get 0 → worse
- If opponent switches to A0, they get 0 → worse than 3

So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium?

Wait:
- You play A1, opponent plays A1: both get 3.
- If **you** switch to A0: you get 0 (since opponent plays A1), worse → no incentive.
- If **opponent** switches to A0: they get 0 (you play A1), worse than 3 → no incentive.

So yes — (A1, A1) is also a pure strategy NE.

But wait, is that right?

Hold on: in (A1, A1), if opponent switches to A0, they get: you play A1, so they get 0. Currently they get 3 → so indeed, they won’t switch.

Similarly, if you switch to A0, while opponent plays A1, you get 0, worse than 3.

So (A1, A1) is a NE.

Now check (A0, A1): you play A0, opponent A1 → you get 0, opponent gets 3

- You: if you switch to A1 → get 3 (since opponent A1) → better → you will deviate → not NE
- Opponent: playing A1, gets 3; if switch to A0 → you play A0 → opponent gets 5 → better → so opponent will deviate

So (A0, A1) is not NE.

(A1, A0): you A1, opp A0 → you get 3, opp gets 0
- You: if switch to A0 → get 5 → better → deviate
- Opponent: if switch to A1 → get 3 → better → deviate

So not NE.

So **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

And one mixed strategy equilibrium: both play A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4

---

### Step 6: Which Equilibrium to Play?

Since both players act simultaneously and independently, and the game is symmetric, but the payoffs are not fully symmetric, we need to decide.

But you are trying to **maximize your own expected points**.

In (A0, A0): you get 5
In (A1, A1): you get 3
So (A0, A0) is better for you.

But if the other player doesn’t coordinate, it’s risky.

But in the absence of communication, and you don’t know the other player’s choice, your best option is to **play a strategy that performs well in equilibrium**.

However, note: if both players play A0, you get 5 — that’s the highest possible payoff for you.

But if you play A0 unilaterally, and opponent plays A1, you get 0.

So you might want to avoid that risk.

But let’s assess: in the mixed strategy NE, where both play A0 with 60%, then:

Your expected payoff:
- You play A0 with p = 0.6 — so use the equilibrium strategy.

But wait: if you play p = 0.6, and opponent plays q = 0.6, then:

- (A0, A0): 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 → you get 5
- (A0, A1): 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 → you get 0
- (A1, A0): 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24 → you get 3
- (A1, A1): 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16 → you get 3

So expected payoff:
> 0.36 * 5 + 0.24 * 0 + 0.24 * 3 + 0.16 * 3  
= 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

So your expected payoff in mixed NE: 3.0

But in pure NE (A0, A0): expected payoff depends on coordination.

But if the opponent is rational and chooses a Nash equilibrium, they might also pick (A0, A0) or (A1, A1).

Now here’s a key issue: in this game, (A0, A0) gives you 5 — higher than 3.

But (A0, A0) is a NE, so if both players independently aim for equilibrium, they might both play A0.

But here’s the problem: **there is no mechanism to coordinate**, and players may miscoordinate.

But note: in (A0, A0), both players are better off than in (A1, A1), but the game has **coordination risk**.

However, here’s a critical observation: in the **mixed strategy NE**, you get only 3.0.

But in **pure strategy NE (A0, A0)**, you get 5.

But if you play **A0 with probability 1**, and the opponent plays A0 with probability 1 (i.e., also plays A0), then you get 5.

But if the opponent plays A1, you get 0.

But if the opponent is also playing a rational mixed strategy, they might play A0 with 60% chance.

But we need to **maximize your own expected payoff**, so we should **choose a strategy that maximizes your minimum guaranteed payoff (maximin)** or **best response to the likely behavior of the other player**.

But note: in the absence of information about the opponent’s behavior, the **only safe and rational equilibrium** to assume is the Nash equilibrium.

However, in this game, there are **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**, and one mixed.

This is a **coordination game**, but not quite standard.

Let’s compare payoffs:

- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

So (A0, A0) is **Pareto superior**.

So if both players can coordinate, they would choose (A0, A0).

But without communication, which one do they pick?

This is a problem of **focal point**.

A focal point in many such games is the (A0, A0) outcome because it gives the highest payoff.

But you must **choose your own strategy**.

Suppose you play A0 with 100% — i.e., p = 100.

Then:
- If the opponent plays A0 (probability q), you get 5
- If opponent plays A1 (probability 1 - q), you get 0

Your expected payoff: 5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q

If the opponent plays A0 with probability q ≥ 0.6 (mixed NE), then you get at least 3.

But if the opponent is playing (A0, A0), then you get 5.

But can you do better?

Now suppose you play A1 with 100%: p = 100.

Then:
- Opponent A0: you get 3
- Opponent A1: you get 3
→ Always 3

So guaranteed 3.

But if you play A0 always, you can get 5 (if they play A0), or 0 (if they play A1). So expected depends on their choice.

But since you don’t know, what should you do?

Now consider: **if the opponent is rational**, and knows the game, they may also choose their equilibrium strategy.

But they could play A0 (pure), because (A0, A0) is a NE.

But why would they play A0? Because it gives them 5, and they don’t want to risk getting 3 or less.

But let’s suppose **both players behave rationally** and choose strategies that are part of a Nash equilibrium.

So possible outcomes: (A0, A0), (A1, A1), or mixed.

To maximize **your expected payoff**, you want to **maximize the probability of (A0, A0)**.

But note: if you play A0 with probability p, and opponent plays A0 with q, then P(A0,A0) = p*q

Your expected payoff:
> 5*p*q + 0*p*(1-q) + 3*(1-p)*q + 3*(1-p)*(1-q)
= 5pq + 3(1-p)q + 3(1-p)(1-q)
= 5pq + 3q - 3pq + 3(1 - p - q + pq)
= (5pq - 3pq + 3pq) + 3q - 3p - 3q + 3
= (5pq) + 3q - 3p - 3q + 3 → wait, simplify:

Wait:
Expand:
= 5pq  
+ 3(1 - p)q = 3q - 3pq  
+ 3(1 - p)(1 - q) = 3(1 - p - q + pq) = 3 - 3p - 3q + 3pq

Now sum:
5pq + (3q - 3pq) + (3 - 3p - 3q + 3pq)  
= 5pq - 3pq + 3pq + 3q - 3q - 3p + 3  
= (5 - 3 + 3)pq + 0*q - 3p + 3  
= 5pq - 3p + 3

So your expected payoff:  
> **E = 5pq - 3p + 3**

Now, you choose p to maximize E **given q**, but you don't know q.

But in Nash equilibrium, both players choose p = q = 0.6

Then E = 5*(0.6)*(0.6) - 3*(0.6) + 3 = 5*0.36 - 1.8 + 3 = 1.8 - 1.8 + 3 = 3.0

Now, suppose **you** play p = 1 (A0 always)

Then E = 5*(1)*q - 3*(1) + 3 = 5q

So if q = 1 (opponent plays A0 always), you get 5

If q = 0.6, you get 3.0

If q = 0, you get 0

But is it rational for the opponent to play A0 with q = 1?

Yes, because (A0, A0) is a NE.

Similarly, they might play A1 with q = 1.

But if you play A0 always (p=1), and opponent is rational and also plays a NE, they might choose q=1 (A0) because it gives them 5 > 3.

So if they think you are playing A0, they are best off playing A0.

Similarly, if they are playing A0, you are best off playing A0.

So **(A0, A0) is a focal equilibrium**.

Now, what if you play p=1, and the opponent thinks the other player might play A0? They have incentive to play A0.

So perhaps **if you play A0 with high probability**, the opponent is more likely to coordinate on (A0, A0).

But is there a risk?

But note: if you play A0 with 100%, and opponent plays A1, you get 0 — bad.

But opponent has strong incentive to play A0.

Similarly, if you play A1, you guarantee 3, but miss out on 5.

So to maximize your **expected points**, and given that **coordination on A0, A0 is possible**, and **you can induce it by playing A0**, you should play A0.

But to be safe?

But let's suppose the opponent is choosing **randomly**, or plays the Nash equilibrium.

But the mixed strategy NE gives you only 3.0.

But if you play **A0 with probability 100**, and the opponent plays A0 with 60%, then your expected payoff is 5*0.6 = 3.0 — same as mixed NE.

But if the opponent is *more rational*, they might pick A0.

So you want to **maximize the chance of success**, but you can’t.

But here’s a key idea: in such games, **playing A0 with 100%** is **not dominated** — because the expected payoff when opponent is in NE is still at least 3.

But since (A0, A0) is a better equilibrium, and you have no information about opponent’s strategy, the **most reasonable** assumption is that they also aim for the Pareto-optimal outcome.

Moreover, **playing A0 with high probability increases the chance of hitting (A0, A0)**.

But what if the opponent also plays A0 with 100%? Then you get 5.

But if you play a mixed strategy, you can’t get 5 — only expected 3.

So **to maximize potential payoff**, you should play A0.

But you could be punished if opponent plays A1.

But if the opponent is rational, they won’t play A1 unless they think you play A0 — but if you play A0, they are better off playing A0.

So **it’s a focal point: play A0**.

This is analogous to the **battle of the sexes** or coordination games.

In such games, players often coordinate on the Pareto-efficient outcome.

Therefore, the **best strategy** is to play A0 with 100%.

But let’s confirm with a final check:

Suppose you play **A0 with 100%**.

Then the opponent, if rational:
- If they play A0: get 5
- If they play A1: get 3
So they prefer A0.

So they will play A0.

Then you get 5.

If they are irrational or do something else, you might get 0 — but since they are rational, they will play A0.

So playing A0 is **best response** to rational opponent aiming for NE.

Therefore, **playing A0 with probability 100%** is optimal.

But wait — is there a possibility they play A1? Only if they believe you are playing A1 — but you’re not.

So yes.

Alternatively, if you play a mixed strategy, say p < 100%, then the opponent might be uncertain, and might choose A1 — and you get less.

So **best to signal strong commitment to A0**.

Thus, **set p = 100**.

But let’s double-check if there’s a reason not to.

What if the opponent believes you are playing mixed, and plays A0 with 60%? Then your expected payoff is 5*0.6 = 3.0 — same as mixed NE.

But if you play A0 always, and they play A0 with 100%, you get 5.

So **you are strictly better off** by playing A0 if they are rational.

Therefore, **A0 with probability 1**.

Final decision: **{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}**

But wait — let’s consider the **risk of getting 0**.

But if the other player is rational, and you play A0, they **must** play A0 — otherwise they get 3 instead of 5.

So they have **no incentive** to play A1.

Hence, your strategy of playing A0 with 100% will **induce** the other player to play A0.

Thus, you get 5 with certainty.

Therefore, **this is optimal**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P1
response:
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without the Contract)**

We are playing a symmetric game with two players, and for each player, actions are A0 and A1.

Base payoffs (Player 1's payoff given their action and the other player's action):

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Payoff |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| A0          | A0                | 5           |
| A0          | A1                | 0           |
| A1          | A0                | 3           |
| A1          | A1                | 3           |

This resembles a coordination game with a bias toward A0 (since 5 > 3), but also has a cost to choosing A0 when opponent chooses A1.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

The contract is **binding** and changes the payoffs.

**Contract Terms:**
- If you choose **A0**, you get **+2 points**, but this is **drawn equally from the other players**.
- If you choose **A1**, you pay **-2 points**, which is **distributed equally among the other players**.

Since there are only 2 players, "other players" means just the one opponent.

So:

- If you choose A0 → you gain +2, opponent loses 2 (i.e., you get +2, they lose 2)
- If you choose A1 → you lose 2, opponent gains 2 (i.e., you get -2, they gain 2)

So the **contract modifies the base payoffs**.

---

### **Step 3: Compute Total Payoffs (Including Contract)**

Let’s write the **total payoff** for Player 1 (you), considering both base payoff and contract.

We will compute total payoff for Player 1 in each of the four cases.

---

#### **Case 1: You A0, Opponent A0**

- Base payoff: 5
- You chose A0 → +2
- Opponent chose A0 → so you are taxed +2 (but wait — no! The contract says: *if you choose A0, you get +2 from the other players*. So it's *you* receiving +2 **regardless** of opponent’s choice.
  
Important: The contract is **based on your own action**, not the outcome.

So regardless of what the other player does, if **you choose A0**, you get +2 **from the other player**.

If **you choose A1**, you pay -2, which is given to the other player.

So contract is **per-action**, not per-outcome.

So:

- **You A0, Opponent A0**:
  - Base: 5
  - Contract: +2 (you chose A0)
  - Total: 5 + 2 = **7**

- **You A0, Opponent A1**:
  - Base: 0
  - Contract: +2 (you chose A0)
  - Total: 0 + 2 = **2**

- **You A1, Opponent A0**:
  - Base: 3
  - Contract: -2 (you chose A1, pay 2 to opponent)
  - Total: 3 - 2 = **1**

- **You A1, Opponent A1**:
  - Base: 3
  - Contract: -2 (you chose A1)
  - Total: 3 - 2 = **1**

So now the **total payoff matrix for Player 1** is:

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Your Total Payoff |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0              | 7                 |
| A0          | A1              | 2                 |
| A1          | A0              | 1                 |
| A1          | A1              | 1                 |

Let’s now look at **Player 2’s total payoff** for completeness (to check for incentives):

- If Player 2 chooses A0 → gets +2 from you
- If Player 2 chooses A1 → pays 2 to you, so loses 2

So:

- **P2 A0, P1 A0**: Base = 5, +2 from P1 → 7
- **P2 A0, P1 A1**: Base = 0, +2 from P1 → 2
- **P2 A1, P1 A0**: Base = 3, pays 2 to P1 → 3 - 2 = 1
- **P2 A1, P1 A1**: Base = 3, pays 2 to P1 → 3 - 2 = 1

So symmetric: P2 gets the same numbers.

But now note: **P1’s payoffs are now asymmetric**.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Strategic Incentives**

We are Player 1. We want to maximize our **expected payoff** under the new rules.

Let’s define:
- Let $ p $ = probability that you (Player 1) choose A0
- Let $ q $ = probability that Player 2 chooses A0

Then your expected payoff is:

$$
E = p \cdot q \cdot 7 + p \cdot (1 - q) \cdot 2 + (1 - p) \cdot q \cdot 1 + (1 - p) \cdot (1 - q) \cdot 1
$$

Simplify:

$$
E = 7pq + 2p(1 - q) + 1(1 - p)q + 1(1 - p)(1 - q)
$$

Break it down:

1. $ 7pq $
2. $ 2p - 2pq $
3. $ q - pq $
4. $ (1 - p)(1 - q) = 1 - p - q + pq $

Now sum:

$$
E = 7pq + 2p - 2pq + q - pq + 1 - p - q + pq
$$

Simplify term by term:

- $ pq $ terms: $ 7pq - 2pq - pq + pq = (7 - 2 - 1 + 1)pq = 5pq $
- $ p $ terms: $ 2p - p = p $
- $ q $ terms: $ q - q = 0 $
- Constant: $ 1 $

So:
$$
E = 5pq + p + 1
$$

Now, we need to **choose $ p $** to maximize expected payoff, given that Player 2 will choose $ q $ in a way that maximizes **their** payoff.

But note: **This is a simultaneous move game**, so we are looking for a **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s compute **Player 2’s best response**.

Player 2’s expected payoff (same as Player 1's due to symmetry in contract? Wait, no — contract is symmetric, and base game is symmetric, so **the game is symmetric**.

So if both players are rational and symmetric, the Nash equilibrium should be symmetric: $ p = q $.

But let’s confirm.

---

### **Step 5: Find Nash Equilibrium**

Assume Player 2 plays $ q $, and we (Player 1) want to choose $ p $ to maximize $ E = 5pq + p + 1 $

Take derivative w.r.t. $ p $:

$$
\frac{dE}{dp} = 5q + 1
$$

This is **always positive**, since $ q \in [0,1] $, so $ 5q + 1 \geq 1 > 0 $

So for **any fixed $ q $**, increasing $ p $ increases expected payoff.

Therefore, Player 1's best response is to set $ p = 1 $ — always play A0.

But wait — is this correct? Let's plug in.

If $ p = 1 $ (you always play A0), then:

$$
E = 5q(1) + 1 + 1 = 5q + 2
$$

Maximized when $ q = 1 $. So you want $ q = 1 $.

But now, **Player 2** — what is their best response to $ p = 1 $? That is, you always play A0.

Player 2’s expected payoff when you play A0:

- If Player 2 plays A0: payoff = 7
- If Player 2 plays A1: payoff = 2

So 7 > 2 → best response is to play A0.

So if Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 responds with A0.

Similarly, if Player 2 plays A0, what is Player 1’s best response?

From earlier: $ E = 5q + p + 1 $, with $ q = 1 $

Then $ E = 5(1) + p + 1 = 6 + p $

Maximized at $ p = 1 $

So Player 1 also wants to play A0.

Thus, **both players playing A0** is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Is there a better one?

Check if both playing A1 is an equilibrium.

If $ p = 0 $ (you play A1), $ q = 0 $ (opponent plays A1):

Your payoff: 1 (from base + contract)

If you deviate to A0: your payoff becomes?

- Opponent plays A1 → you get base 0, plus contract +2 → 2 > 1

So you have incentive to deviate → not equilibrium.

What about mixed strategies?

Suppose Player 2 plays $ q $. Then Player 1’s expected payoff:

$ E = 5pq + p + 1 = p(5q + 1) + 1 $

Since $ 5q + 1 > 0 $, this is **strictly increasing** in $ p $, so Player 1 always wants to set $ p = 1 $.

Thus, **best response of Player 1 is always to play A0**, regardless of $ q $.

Therefore, the only possible Nash equilibrium is when **Player 1 plays A0**, and **Player 2 best responds with A0**.

And since Player 2’s best response to A0 is A0, it holds.

So **(A0, A0)** is the unique Nash equilibrium.

Hence, **you should play A0 with probability 100%**.

---

### **Step 6: But Wait — Is This Sustainable?**

Let’s double-check:

If you play A0 always, opponent gets:

- If they play A0: 7
- If they play A1: 2

So they prefer A0 → they will play A0 → you get 7

If you play A1, even if opponent plays A0: your payoff is 1
But if you play A0, opponent plays A0, you get 7 — better.

So no incentive to deviate.

Thus, playing A0 is dominant strategy?

Wait — is A0 dominant?

Check: Is choosing A0 always better than A1, for any opponent strategy?

Let’s compare:

- Your payoff if you play A0, opponent plays $ q $:

  $ E(A0) = q \cdot 7 + (1 - q) \cdot 2 = 7q + 2 - 2q = 5q + 2 $

- Your payoff if you play A1, opponent plays $ q $:

  $ E(A1) = q \cdot 1 + (1 - q) \cdot 1 = 1 $

Now compare: $ 5q + 2 > 1 $ for all $ q \geq 0 $? Let's see:

- When $ q = 0 $: $ 5(0) + 2 = 2 > 1 $
- When $ q = 1 $: $ 5 + 2 = 7 > 1 $

So yes: for **all** $ q \in [0,1] $, $ 5q + 2 \geq 2 > 1 $

Thus, **A0 dominates A1**

You get **higher payoff** no matter what the other player does.

So **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy**.

> Therefore, you should always play A0.

---

### **Step 7: Final Decision**

You should choose **A0 with 100% probability**, A1 with 0%.

This maximizes your expected payoff under all possible opponent strategies.

response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2 (you).

**Payoff Matrix:**
- (P1: A0, P2: A0) -> (5, 5)
- (P1: A0, P2: A1) -> (0, 3)
- (P1: A1, P2: A0) -> (3, 0)
- (P1: A1, P2: A1) -> (3, 3)

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1.  **Analyze Nash Equilibria:** We identify the Nash Equilibria of the game. If Player 1 chooses A0, your best response is A0 (5 points vs. 3 points). If Player 1 chooses A1, your best response is A1 (3 points vs. 0 points). Similarly, Player 1's best responses are A0 if you choose A0 and A1 if you choose A1. Thus, both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash Equilibria.
2.  **Evaluate Efficiency:** Comparing the two equilibria, (A0, A0) results in 5 points for each player, while (A1, A1) results in only 3 points. (A0, A0) is Pareto superior, meaning it is the most efficient outcome for both parties.
3.  **Consider the "Twist":** A contract was proposed to penalize A1, which would have reinforced A0 as the dominant choice. Although Player 1 rejected the contract, the mutual benefit of the (5, 5) outcome remains the logical focal point for rational players seeking to maximize their total points.
4.  **Conclusion:** Given that (A0, A0) offers the highest possible payoff for both players and is a stable equilibrium, selecting A0 with 100% probability is the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum score.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without the Contract)**

The game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0        | A1        |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**                        | (5, 5)    | (0, 3)    |
| **A1**                        | (3, 0)    | (3, 3)    |

This resembles a variant of the **Prisoner’s Dilemma**, but with some nuances:

- If both play A0: (5,5) — best mutual outcome.
- If you play A0 and other plays A1: you get 0, they get 3.
- If you play A1 and other plays A0: you get 3, they get 0.
- If both play A1: (3,3) — worse than (5,5), but better than being exploited.

But note: There is **no incentive to play A1 unilaterally** when the other plays A0 — you get 3 (from A1) vs 5 (from A0), so you lose. So **A0 is dominant** in some sense?

Wait — let’s check for dominant strategies:

- If opponent plays A0:
  - You: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → better to choose A0.
- If opponent plays A1:
  - You: A0 → 0, A1 → 3 → better to choose A1.

So **no pure strategy is dominant**.

This is actually a **coordination game with a conflict of interest**, or more precisely, **a game with two Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), but (A0,A0) is Pareto superior.

But (A0,A0) is risky: if you think the other might play A1, then you’re better off playing A1 (3 vs 0).

So the game is similar to a **battle of the sexes** variant, or even a **stags hunt**.

But importantly: **(A0,A0) gives 5 each**, (A1,A1) gives 3 each.

So mutual cooperation (A0) is best. But if you fear the other will play A1, you may play A1 to avoid getting 0.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

The contract is **proposed by Player 1**, and requires **all players to sign** for it to be active.

The contract terms:

- If a player chooses **A0**: no additional payment.
- If a player chooses **A1**: they **pay 1 point**, and this is **distributed equally among the other players**.

Since there are two players, if you choose A1, you **pay 1 point**, and the **other player gets +0.5** (because 1 point distributed equally → 0.5 each, but only one other player → they get 0.5).

Wait — "distributed equally among the other players"

So:

- When **you** choose A1, you **lose 1 point** (you pay 1).
- The **other player** receives +1 point — split equally among the other players.

Since there's only **one other player**, they get the full 1 point.

So, if **you** play A1 → you pay 1 → your payoff is reduced by 1.

If **you** play A0 → no cost.

If **other** plays A1 → they pay 1, and **you** gain 1 (from the payment to you).

So this contract **penalizes playing A1**, and **benefits you when the other plays A1**.

Let’s compute the **new payoffs** under the contract.

But **only** if the contract is signed.

We are deciding whether **Player 1 (you)** should sign it.

Note: The contract only takes effect **if both players sign**.

So if you sign, but the other doesn’t sign, the contract doesn’t apply.

But the contract is **proposed by Player 1** and approved by voting — so it’s implied that **if you don't sign**, it fails.

So to activate, **both must sign**.

So your decision is: **Do I want to sign this contract?**

We assume that **the other player will decide based on their self-interest**, and may or may not sign it.

But you can't control their choice — so you must consider: **Would signing this contract improve your expected payoff, given that the other player may or may not sign it?**

But the description says: *"the contract becomes active only if all players sign it."*

So we need to evaluate the **expected value** of signing vs not signing, considering that the other player may or may not sign.

But we don’t have information about the other player’s rationality or preferences — so we assume they are rational and self-interested.

So the other player will sign only if **they expect to benefit from it**.

Therefore, we need to model this as a **meta-game**: you decide whether to sign, and then the other player decides whether to sign, **based on whether the contract improves their payoff**, depending on your action.

But wait — actually, we act **simultaneously**: you choose whether to sign, and the other player chooses whether to sign.

But the contract only activates if both sign.

So outcomes:

1. You sign, other signs → contract active.
2. You sign, other doesn’t → no contract.
3. You don’t sign, other signs → no contract.
4. You don’t sign, other doesn’t → no contract.

So only scenario 1 triggers the contract.

Now, we are to decide: **Should you sign?**

So we need to compare:

- Your expected payoff **if you sign**
- Your expected payoff **if you do not sign**
- But both depend on the other player’s choice, which will likely depend on whether they expect to benefit.

So let’s analyze **if the contract is in place**, what happens.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Game WITH the Contract Active**

Assume **both have signed**, so contract is active.

Then the **payoffs are modified**:

The original payoffs are **adjusted**:

- If you play A1, you **lose 1 point** (pay 1).
- If the other plays A1, they lose 1, and **you gain 1** (from their payment).

So let’s compute the **new payoff matrix** under contract.

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0         | A1 (+1 to you) |
|------------------------------|------------|----------------|
| **A0**                       | (5, 5)     | (0 +1, 3 -1) = (1, 2) |
| **A1**                       | (3 -1, 0) = (2, 0) | (3 -1, 3 -1) = (2, 2) |

Wait: Let’s clarify:

- When **you** play A1: you **lose 1** point (from contract).
- When **other** plays A1: you **gain 1** point (from contract).

So:

- (A0, A0): no A1 played → (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): you play A0 → no cost to you; other plays A1 → they pay 1, you get +1 → so your payoff: 0 + 1 = **1**, other's: 3 - 1 = **2**
- (A1, A0): you play A1 → you lose 1; other plays A0 → no cost to them → your payoff: 3 - 1 = **2**, other's: 0
- (A1, A1): both play A1 → you lose 1, other loses 1, but you each gain 1 from the other’s payment → your payoff: 3 - 1 + 1 = **3**, other’s: 3 - 1 + 1 = **3**

Wait — is that correct?

Let’s clarify: **"If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point, distributed equally among the other players."**

So if **both** play A1:

- You pay 1 → but you also **receive** 1 from the other player’s payment (since they are one other player, and it's distributed equally among others → you get 1/1 = 1).
- So net: you lose 1 (your payment) and gain 1 (from other’s payment) → net zero.
- So your total payoff: original 3 + (net 0) = **3**
- Same for the other player: 3.

So yes: (A1, A1) → (3, 3)

Similarly:

- (A0, A1): you play A0 → no cost. Other plays A1 → they pay 1 → you receive all of it → +1. Your original payoff is 0 → so **1**. Their original is 3 → lose 1 → **2**

- (A1, A0): you play A1 → you pay 1 → original payoff 3 → 3 - 1 = 2. Other plays A0 → no payment → their payoff: 0

- (A0, A0): (5,5)

So the new payoff matrix (under contract) is:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0        | A1         |
|-------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| **A0**                        | (5, 5)    | (1, 2)     |
| **A1**                        | (2, 0)    | (3, 3)     |

Now, what are the **best responses**?

Let’s analyze this game.

#### For Player 1 (you):

If other plays A0:
- You: A0 → 5, A1 → 2 → better to play A0

If other plays A1:
- You: A0 → 1, A1 → 3 → better to play A1

So no dominant strategy.

Now look for **Nash equilibria**:

1. (A0, A0): you get 5, they get 5.
   - If you deviate to A1: you get 2 < 5 → no incentive.
   - If other deviates to A1: they get 2 < 5 → no incentive.
   → **Nash equilibrium**

2. (A1, A1): you get 3, other gets 3.
   - You deviate to A0: get 1 < 3 → no incentive.
   - Other deviates to A0: get 0 < 3 → no incentive.
   → **Nash equilibrium**

3. (A0, A1): you get 1, other gets 2.
   - You would prefer A1 → get 3 > 1 → so not equilibrium.
   - Other prefers A0 → get 5 > 2 → no.

4. (A1, A0): you get 2, other gets 0.
   - You want to go to A0 (5 > 2)
   - Other wants to go to A1 (3 > 0)
   → not equilibrium.

So there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But (A0,A0) is **Pareto optimal** — gives more to both.

Now, **is (A0,A0) more likely** under the contract?

Yes! Because in (A0,A0), both get 5, which is better than 3 in (A1,A1).

Also, under contract, **A0 is strictly better if you think the other plays A0**, and **A1 is better if you think the other plays A1**.

So there’s still a coordination problem: do players coordinate on A0 or A1?

But (A0,A0) is better for both.

So we might expect players to **coordinate on (A0,A0)**, especially since it’s better.

But could they coordinate on (A1,A1)? Yes, but it’s worse.

But since both players are rational and aim to maximize points, and (A0,A0) gives 5 > 3, **they should coordinate on A0**.

So if the contract is in place, the rational outcome is likely (A0,A0), with payoffs (5,5).

But **can we trust that?**

Yes, because in a symmetric game with two equilibria, but one strictly better, and no asymmetry, **they’ll likely coordinate on the payoffs-maximizing equilibrium** — especially if they can communicate or reason symmetrically.

So under contract, expected payoff (assuming coordination on (A0,A0)) is **5**.

But wait: what if the other player doesn’t believe you’ll cooperate? Then we might fall into (A1,A1), getting only 3.

But in the **contracted game**, (A0,A0) is **better** and **stable**, so rational players should aim for it.

So let’s assume that **under the contract**, both players will **strategically coordinate on (A0,A0)**, leading to 5 points each.

So expected payoff under contract: **5**

Now, what if the **contract is not active**?

Then we return to the original game.

Original payoff matrix:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0        | A1        |
|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**                        | (5, 5)    | (0, 3)    |
| **A1**                        | (3, 0)    | (3, 3)    |

This game has:

- (A0,A0): (5,5) — Pareto optimal, Nash
- (A1,A1): (3,3) — Nash

But again, (A0,A0) is better.

But **now**, what happens?

If you play A0, and they play A0 → you get 5.

But if you play A0, and they play A1 → you get 0.

So you risk getting 0 if they play A1.

Similarly, if you play A1, you get 3 regardless — safer.

So in the original game, **A1 is a safe strategy** — gives 3 no matter what.

A0 is risky: it gives 5 only if others play A0, but 0 if they play A1.

So rational players may **fear being exploited** and play A1.

Thus, even though (A0,A0) is better, the **risk dominance** goes to (A1,A1).

In fact, this game is a **dilemma**: both players want to cooperate, but each fears the other won’t, so they choose A1.

So the likely outcome is **(A1,A1)** — each gets 3.

Alternatively, if they can trust each other, they might play (A0,A0) — 5 each.

But unless communication is possible, **(A1,A1)** is more likely.

So in **the original game, expected payoff is likely 3** (if both play A1), or possibly 5 if they coordinate.

But since the game is symmetric and no communication is mentioned, we must assume **lack of communication** → so **players cannot coordinate on A0**.

Therefore, the **most likely outcome** in the original game is **(A1,A1)** → payoff of **3**.

Now, **under the contract**, we argued that (A0,A0) becomes **more likely** because it's better for both, and the contract makes A1 less attractive (you get 3 at best in (A1,A1), and even in (A1,A0) you get only 2).

But more importantly, the **contract makes A0 more attractive** when others might play A0 — since if they play A0, you get 5 instead of 3.

And in (A0,A1), you get 1 (still worse than 3), but less bad than 0.

But now, the **big change** is: **if you both play A0, you get 5**, which is *better than before*.

And **A1 is worse**: in (A1,A1), you get 3 (same), but in (A1,A0) you get only 2, whereas before you got 3.

So the contract reduces the **incentive to defect**.

In particular, now **deviating from A0 to A1** only gives you 2 (vs 5), so a big drop.

So it **punishes** defection more effectively.

Thus, the contract **makes (A0,A0) more stable**.

Hence, **with contract**, **(A0,A0) is more likely** than without.

Therefore, under contract, **expected payoff ≈ 5**

Without contract, **expected payoff ≈ 3**

So signing the contract increases your payoff from ~3 to ~5.

But **only if the contract is signed**.

But **you can only sign if the other player also signs**.

Now, the critical question: **Will the other player sign the contract?**

Because if the other player doesn’t sign, **the contract doesn’t activate**, and you get only the risk of 3.

But **if you sign**, and they don’t, nothing changes — your payoff is still determined by the original game (≈3).

But **if the other player signs**, then **you only benefit if they sign** — and you must sign too.

So now consider: **Will the other player sign?**

Let’s consider **from the other player's perspective**.

They will sign **only if they believe it increases their expected payoff**.

Let’s suppose **you sign**.

Then the other player must decide: should they sign?

They will compare:

- **If they sign**: contract activates → then they play the new game with payoff matrix above.

  - They expect to get **5** if they coordinate on (A0,A0) → which is better than 3.

  - Even if they fear coordination fails and they get 3, it's no worse.

  - But in worst case, they still get 3.

  - And in best case, they get 5.

So signing is **safe or better**, because:

- The **worst** case (if they end up in (A1,A1)) → they get 3 (same as original).
- **Best case** → 5.
- And **if they think coordination is likely**, they get 5.

So signing is **weakly improving** for them.

But what if they think **you won’t sign**?

But the contract requires **both to sign**, so if they sign but you don’t, nothing happens.

So their **expected benefit** depends on whether they think **you will sign**.

But they are rational and self-interested.

So here’s the key: **the contract is proposed by you**, and you are deciding whether to sign.

But the other player doesn't know your decision until after.

But we assume they are rational and will **only sign if they expect to gain**.

Now, consider: **If you sign, will they sign?**

If they think you will sign, then:

- The contract activates only if they also sign.
- If they sign, they get either 5 (if (A0,A0)) or 3 (if (A1,A1)) — but 5 is better than 3, so they’d prefer (A0,A0).

But can they trust you?

Yes — because if you sign, **you have an incentive** to play A0, because:

- If they play A0, you get 5.
- If they play A1, you get 1 (from (A0,A1)) — worse than 3, but still, playing A0 is best if you think they play A0.

But actually, if **they play A1**, then:

- If you play A0 → you get 1
- If you play A1 → you get 3

So you prefer A1.

So even under contract, if they play A1, you want to play A1.

So **no incentive to cooperate** unless they are likely to cooperate.

But under contract, if both play A0 → you get 5.

But if one plays A1 and other A0 → you get only 2 (you play A1), worse than 3.

So both have **incentive to stick to A0** only if they believe the other will too.

But the **contract makes (A0,A0) strictly better**.

So if there’s any chance of coordination, they prefer to coordinate on A0.

So **both players have incentive to sign the contract**, because it **makes coordination on A0 more likely**.

Moreover, **if you sign**, and the contract activates, then the other player knows that:

- If they also sign, then the new game begins.
- In that game, (A0,A0) yields 5, which is better than 3.
- So they have **no reason not to** sign — because it only helps them, and gives them a chance at 5.

In fact, if they **don’t sign**, then the contract doesn’t activate, and they revert to the original game, where **(A1,A1)** is more likely → payoff 3.

Whereas if they **sign**, they get **at least 3**, and possibly 5.

So signing **increases the chance of high payoff**.

So **the other player will sign only if they believe you sign** — but since you are rational, and **signing increases your payoff from 3 to 5**, **you** will want to sign.

And since **they also benefit**, they will want to sign.

Thus, **if you sign, they will sign**, because they benefit from it.

Similarly, if they sign, you benefit — so you will also sign.

So the **contract is self-enforcing**.

Thus, **if you sign**, **they will sign**, and the contract activates.

Then the game proceeds under contract → and **(A0,A0)** is played → you get **5**.

If you **don’t sign**, then no contract → game reverts to original → likely (A1,A1) → you get **3**.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

---

### **Final Answer**

Signing increases your expected payoff from 3 to 5.

It creates a mechanism that makes cooperation (A0,A0) more stable and more likely.

The other player will also sign because they benefit.

So the contract is beneficial to both.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 1

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

response:
Let's go step by step to analyze the game and determine the optimal strategy.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without the Contract**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses an action: A0 or A1.

The payoff matrix (for Player 1, then Player 2) is:

|          | A0         | A1         |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **A0**   | (5, 5)     | (0, 3)     |
| **A1**   | (3, 0)     | (3, 3)     |

So:
- If both play A0 → (5,5)
- You play A0, opponent A1 → (0,3)
- You play A1, opponent A0 → (3,0)
- Both play A1 → (3,3)

---

### **Step 2: Identify the Type of Game**

This game is a coordination game with a twist — playing A0 together gives the best payoff (5,5), but if you’re unsure of the other player’s choice, playing A1 can be safer.

But note: A1 dominates A0 for Player 1 in a certain way?

Let’s analyze best responses.

---

### **Step 3: Compute Best Responses**

Let’s suppose the other player plays A0 with probability **p**, and A1 with probability **1−p**.

Then, your expected payoff for choosing:
- A0:  
  = p×5 + (1−p)×0 = 5p
- A1:  
  = p×3 + (1−p)×3 = 3

So your payoff from A0 is **5p**, from A1 is **3**.

You choose A0 iff:  
5p > 3 → p > 3/5 = 0.6

So:
- If p > 0.6 → best response is A0
- If p < 0.6 → best response is A1
- If p = 0.6 → indifferent

Similarly, for the other player, since the game is symmetric (payoffs are symmetric), same logic applies.

---

### **Step 4: Find Nash Equilibria**

We look for symmetric and asymmetric equilibria.

#### **Pure Strategy Equilibria:**

- (A0, A0):  
  If opponent plays A0, you get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so A0 is best response.  
  → This is a Nash equilibrium.

- (A1, A1):  
  If opponent plays A1, you get 3 for A0 (but wait! If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0), so:
    - A0: 0
    - A1: 3  
  So best response is A1 → Nash equilibrium.

- (A0, A1):  
  You play A0, opponent A1 → you get 0; if you switch to A1, you get 3 → not best response → not equilibrium.

- (A1, A0):  
  You get 3, but if you switch to A0, you get 5 → not best response.

So only **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

#### **Mixed Strategy Equilibrium:**

Suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with 1−p.

As above, Player 1 is indifferent when:
5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

Similarly, for Player 2 to be indifferent, Player 1 must play A0 with probability 0.6.

So there exists a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** where both players play A0 with 60% probability, A1 with 40%.

This is the symmetric mixed equilibrium.

---

### **Step 5: Consider the Contract (Why It’s Not Active)**

The contract was proposed by Player 1 but rejected by **Player 1 themselves**. So the contract is not active.

Thus, we play the **original game** with no additional costs.

But the contract idea was:  
- If you play A1, you pay 1 point, split among other players.

But since it was rejected (by Player 1!), it is **not applied**.

So we ignore it.

---

### **Step 6: What Should You Do?**

You are Player 1, and your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff**.

You don’t know what the other player will do. But you can assume they are rational and will play a Nash equilibrium.

There are **three** Nash equilibria:
1. (A0, A0) — both play A0 → you get 5
2. (A1, A1) — both play A1 → you get 3
3. Mixed: both play (60% A0, 40% A1)

Now, which one is most likely?

But note: (A0, A0) gives the highest payoff (5), which is best. But it’s risky: if the other player plays A0, you're better off playing A0. But if they play anything else, you lose.

However, since the game is symmetric and both players are rational, they might try to coordinate on (A0, A0). But there's no communication, so coordination failure is possible.

In such games with multiple equilibria, the **risk-dominant** equilibrium is often chosen.

Let’s compute risk dominance.

The risk-dominant equilibrium is the one where the payoff loss from deviating is smaller.

Alternatively, in a symmetric coordination game, we can ask: which equilibrium is more likely to be played?

Here’s a better way: **If you believe the other player will play mixed strategy at 60% A0**, then:

Your expected payoff from playing:
- A0: 5×0.6 + 0×0.4 = 3.0
- A1: 3×0.6 + 3×0.4 = 1.8 + 1.2 = 3.0

So you are indifferent.

But if you think the other player is leaning toward A0, then A0 gives you higher payoff.

But since (A0, A0) gives 5, and (A1, A1) gives only 3, and if both players are rational and symmetric, it's likely that **they might try to coordinate on A0**.

But without communication, players may fear that the other player will play A1, so they might play A1 to avoid getting 0.

This is a classic **coordination game with a Pareto-superior equilibrium**.

Empirical and theoretical results suggest that in such games, **players often coordinate on the payoff-dominant equilibrium (A0, A0)** if they can share common knowledge or if the game is played once.

But if they are uncertain, they may play a mixed strategy.

However, **since this is a single round**, no learning.

So: what makes the most sense?

Let’s consider: the **only way** to get more than 3 points is to play A0 when the opponent plays A0 — you get 5.

But if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0 — which is bad.

So, if you play A0 with high probability, you might get 5 with high chance (if they play A0), but risk getting 0.

Alternatively, A1 always gives you 3, regardless of what the other player does.

So A1 is **safe**.

But A0 can be **rewarding**.

Now, suppose you believe the other player is also rational and symmetric. Then, if you play A0, you expect they will play A0, but only if they also believe you will.

But since you’re symmetric, the **symmetric mixed equilibrium** where both play A0 with 60% is a natural candidate.

Moreover, in real-world coordination games, mixed equilibria are often observed when players are uncertain about coordination.

But let’s try to find a **dominant strategy**:

Is there any strategy that dominates?

- A0: gives 5 if opponent plays A0, 0 if A1
- A1: gives 3 regardless

So A1 is **never worse** than A0, and sometimes better (if opponent plays A1).

So A1 is **weakly dominant**?

Wait: if opponent plays A0, A0 gives 5 > 3 → so A0 is better when opponent plays A0.

But A1 gives 3 always, while A0 gives 0 when opponent plays A1.

So no action dominates the other.

But A1 is **minimax**: it guarantees 3.

A0 has a maximum of 5, but minimum of 0.

So risk-averse players prefer A1.

But if you believe the other player will play A0 with high probability, you may want to play A0.

But what if both players think this way?

Suppose both players think the other will play A0 — then both play A0 → great.

But if one plays A0 and the other plays A1, the one playing A0 gets 0.

So if there's any uncertainty, playing A0 is risky.

In fact, **A1 is a safer choice**.

But here’s the key: the payoff for (A1, A1) is 3 for both — same as the payoff for A1 when the other plays A0 or A1, so **no benefit to A1 except safety**.

But since the (A0, A0) outcome is so much better (5 vs 3), players may try to coordinate.

But without communication, **the mixed strategy equilibrium is a stable prediction**.

So, if you expect the other player to play A0 with 60%, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

So the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a credible prediction.

Moreover, since you are rational and assume the other player is too, you should play the mixed strategy that makes the other player indifferent.

So, to make the other player indifferent between A0 and A1, you must play:

Let **your probability of A0 be q**.

Then, other player's expected payoff from:
- A0: q×5 + (1−q)×0 = 5q
- A1: q×3 + (1−q)×3 = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 0.6

So to make the other player indifferent, you must play A0 with 60%.

And since the game is symmetric, the other player will do the same.

Thus, the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is: **play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%**.

This is the most robust prediction in the absence of communication.

Moreover, playing any other strategy would make you predictable and exploitable.

---

### **Final Decision**

To maximize your expected payoff under rational play, assuming the other player also plays rationally, you should play:

- A0: 60%
- A1: 40%

This is the symmetric mixed Nash equilibrium.

Even if you could get more by coordinating on A0, without communication, you cannot guarantee it — and playing A0 with high probability risks getting 0.

So the **safe and rational** choice is the mixed strategy.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)**

We are playing a two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0 | A1 |
|------------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                                 | 5, 5 | 0, 3 |
| A1                                 | 3, 0 | 3, 3 |

As **Player 2**, we are interested in maximizing our own points.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibrium of the base game.

#### **Best responses:**

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You get: 5 (if A0), 3 (if A1) → Best response: **A0**
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You get: 0 (if A0), 3 (if A1) → Best response: **A1**

- If you play A0:
  - Player 1 gets: 5 (if A0), 3 (if A1) → Best response: **A0**
- If you play A1:
  - Player 1 gets: 0 (if A0), 3 (if A1) → Best response: **A1**

So, there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

Also, there's a mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let’s compute the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with probability (1−p)
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with probability (1−q)

Player 2’s expected payoff from:
- Playing A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
- Playing A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3

Set them equal for indifference:
5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So, in equilibrium, Player 1 plays A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If Player 2 plays A0: 5q + 3(1−q) = 5q + 3 − 3q = 2q + 3
- If Player 2 plays A1: 0q + 3(1−q) = 3 − 3q

Set equal: 2q + 3 = 3 − 3q → 2q = −3q → 5q = 0 → q = 0

Wait — that’s not right. Let’s double-check.

Wait — actually, we need to set Player 2's indifference.

We already did: Player 2 is indifferent when p = 0.6

Now for Player 1.

Player 1's expected payoffs:
- If Player 1 plays A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- If Player 1 plays A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

Equating: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So, in mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:  
- Player 1 plays A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4  
- Player 2 plays A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4

Then expected payoff for Player 2:
- If you play A0: 5*(0.6) + 0*(0.4) = 3  
- If you play A1: 3*(0.6) + 3*(0.4) = 3

So expected payoff = 3

Wait — that suggests you get 3 in the mixed strategy equilibrium.

But in (A0, A0), you get 5 — which is better.

But in the Nash equilibrium, the players are playing mixed strategies.

However, we are not assuming rational opponents necessarily. The question is: **should you sign the contract?**

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract says:
- If a player chooses A0: **no additional payment**
- If a player chooses A1: they **pay 1 point**, and this payment is **distributed equally among the other players**

There are two players → so if you play A1, you pay 1 point, and the other player gets **+0.5** (since 1 point / 2 players → but only one other player, so 1 point total to others)

Wait: "distributed equally among the other players"

Since only one other player, the entire 1 point goes to them.

So:
- If you choose A1 → you lose 1 point (pay 1 point)
- The other player gets +1 point

If the other player chooses A1 → they lose 1 point, you get +1 point

If you choose A0 → no cost, no benefit

So this contract effectively **increases the cost of choosing A1 by 1 point**, but **gives the other player 1 point** when you play A1.

So we need to **update the payoff matrix** under the contract.

---

### **Step 3: Update the payoffs with the contract**

Assume the contract is signed and active.

Now, the total payoff includes:
- Base payoff from original game
- Additional contract payment

Let’s write the new payoff matrix (you are Player 2):

| You \ Other | A0 | A1 |
|-------------|----|----|
| A0          | 5 + 0, 5 + 0 = 5,5 | 0 + 0, 3 + 1 = 0,4 |
| A1          | 3 - 1, 0 + 1 = 2,1 | 3 - 1, 3 + 1 = 2,4 |

Let’s break this down:

- (A0, A0): you get 5 (base), no contract effect. Other gets 5. → (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): you get 0 (base), no contract effect (you played A0), other played A1 → other pays 1, so you get +1 → you: 0, other: 3+1=4 → (0,4)
- (A1, A0): you play A1 → you pay 1 → your base is 3, minus 1 → 2; other played A0 → no cost, but you paid 1 → other gets +1 → other: 0+1 = 1 → (2,1)
- (A1, A1): you play A1 → pay 1 → base 3 − 1 = 2; other played A1 → they pay 1 → you get +1 → 3+1=4 → (2,4)

So the new payoff matrix is:

| You \ Other | A0 | A1 |
|-------------|----|----|
| A0          | (5,5) | (0,4) |
| A1          | (2,1) | (2,4) |

Now, analyze this new game.

---

### **Step 4: Find best responses and equilibria in the new game**

#### Your best responses (as Player 2):

- If other plays A0:
  - You: A0 → 5, A1 → 2 → better to play **A0**
- If other plays A1:
  - You: A0 → 0, A1 → 2 → better to play **A1**

So your best response:
- A0 if other plays A0
- A1 if other plays A1

Now, what about the other player’s best responses?

They are Player 1.

- If you play A0:
  - They get: A0 → 5, A1 → 4 → best to play **A0**
- If you play A1:
  - They get: A0 → 1, A1 → 4 → best to play **A1**

So their best response:
- A0 if you play A0
- A1 if you play A1

So the equilibria are:
- (A0, A0): both get 5 — best for both
- (A1, A1): both get 2 (you) and 4 (other) → you get only 2

But (A0, A0) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

Also, is there a mixed strategy?

Let’s check if (A0, A0) is stable.

Yes: if both play A0, neither wants to deviate.

If you deviate to A1, you go from 5 to 2 → worse.

If other deviates from A0 to A1, they go from 5 to 4 → worse.

So (A0, A0) is a strong equilibrium.

Also, (A1, A1): you get 2, other gets 4.

If you deviate to A0: you get 0 → worse.

If other deviates to A0: they get 1 → worse.

So also a Nash equilibrium.

But now, **in (A0, A0)**, you get 5 — better than in the original game’s mixed equilibrium (3), and better than (A1,A1) (2).

Also, in this game, (A0, A0) is more likely to happen, because:
- Playing A0 is always a best response when the other plays A0
- The temptation to play A1 is gone — it’s worse than A0 unless the other plays A1

But the only time A1 is better is if you believe the other plays A1.

But if the other plays A1, you play A1 → but you only get 2, which is worse than 5.

So the only stable outcome is likely (A0, A0), where both get 5.

In contrast, in the original game, without the contract, (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium, but so is (A1, A1), and players might not coordinate on A0.

But with the contract, **the payoff of playing A1 is reduced**, and **the payoff of cooperating (A0)** is now **more stable**.

In particular, **playing A1 now hurts you directly** (you lose 1 point), and **the other player gets more** — so you have less incentive to play A1.

Also, note: in the original game, A1 was a best response to A1 (you get 3), but now it’s only 2 — worse.

And A1 vs A0: you get 3 originally → 2 now.

So **A1 is strictly worse** than A0 in all cases.

Wait — let’s check:

- If other plays A0:
  - A0: 5
  - A1: 2 → A0 better
- If other plays A1:
  - A0: 0
  - A1: 2 → A1 better

So A1 is better **only if the other plays A1**

But in the contract version, if you play A1, you lose 1, and the other gains.

But more importantly — if both players are rational and know this, **they are incentivized to play A0**.

In fact, (A0, A0) is a dominant strategy equilibrium?

Let’s test:

For **you (Player 2)**:

- If other plays A0:
  - A0: 5, A1: 2 → A0 better
- If other plays A1:
  - A0: 0, A1: 2 → A1 better

So A0 is not dominant — it depends.

But now consider: **is there a way to coordinate on (A0, A0)?**

Yes — because the contract makes A1 riskier for you: you pay a cost, and you only benefit if the other also plays A1, but even then you get less.

But crucially: **if both players sign the contract, the outcome (A0, A0) is stable and gives you 5 points.**

Now, compare this to the **original game without contract**, where if you **don’t sign**, you face a game where (A0, A0) is stable, but (A1, A1) is also stable.

Players might coordinate on (A0, A0), but there’s also an equilibrium at (A1, A1), where you get only 3.

But with the contract, **(A1, A1) becomes worse for you** — you get only 2 instead of 3.

And (A0, A0) is still 5.

So signing the contract improves the outcome:

- You are safer from being exploited (if other plays A1, you lose 0 → but under contract, you get 0 vs 2 → but actually worse)
  Wait — no: if other plays A1, under contract you get 0 (if you play A0) vs 2 (if you play A1) → so you might still prefer A1

But the key is: **if you sign, the other player might also be incentivized to play A0**, because if they play A1, they pay 1, and you get +1, but if you play A0, you get 0 — so their payoff from A1 if you play A0 is 1 (vs 5 if they play A0) — so they are worse off.

So **if we assume both players are rational and expect the other to be rational**, then **(A0, A0) is more likely** under the contract.

Moreover, the contract removes the incentive to play A1 **if the other player is likely to play A0**, which they are, because otherwise they get only 1 (from A0) vs 4 (from A1) — but only if they think you play A1.

Wait — better to analyze stability.

But here’s the key insight: **with the contract, there is no longer a pure Nash equilibrium where you get 3.**

In fact:
- (A1, A1) yields (2,4) to (you, other)
- But if you play A1, and other plays A0 → you get 2, other gets 1 → but other prefers A0 → so if you play A1, they will not play A1? Wait no — if you play A1, they should play A1 to get 4 (vs 1 if they play A0)

But you get 2 anyway.

But you get 2, which is less than 5.

But is there any incentive to play A1?

Only if you believe the other will also play A1.

But if they believe you will play A1, and they play A1, they get 4 — better than 1.

But then you get 2 — lower than 5.

So the only way both get high payoffs is if they coordinate on (A0, A0).

Now, **if the contract is signed**, and both players know this, and both are rational, then **playing A0 is safer**:

- If the other plays A0: you get 5 (vs 2)
- If the other plays A1: you get 2 (vs 0)

So **in all cases, playing A0 is at least as good** as playing A1? No:

Wait:

- If other plays A0: A0 → 5, A1 → 2 → A0 better
- If other plays A1: A0 → 0, A1 → 2 → A1 better

So A1 is better when other plays A1.

But can you *predict* that the other will play A1?

Only if they believe you will play A1.

But if both believe the other will play A1, then (A1, A1) happens — you get 2.

But you could get 5 if you play A0 and they do too.

So the **risk** in playing A1 is that if the other plays A0, you get only 2.

But in the original game, you could get 3.

So with contract, playing A1 is riskier: you get 2 if other plays A0, vs 3 originally.

And you get 2 if other plays A1 — same as before.

So playing A1 gives you **worse payoff** in all cases? No:

- When other plays A0: A1 gives 2 < 3 (original)
- When other plays A1: A1 gives 2 (contract) vs 3 (original) → worse

Wait — **under contract, A1 is strictly worse than A1 in original?**

No: A1 in original vs A1 in contract:

- Original: A1 vs A1 → 3
- With contract: A1 vs A1 → 2

So yes — A1 gives **less than 3** — specifically 2.

And A1 vs A0: 2 vs 3

So in **every case**, **playing A1 gives you less than or equal to the original payoff**, and **strictly less in two cases**:

- A1 vs A0: 2 < 3
- A1 vs A1: 2 < 3

And A0 vs A0: 5 = 5 — same

A0 vs A1: 0 vs 0 — same

So **in all scenarios, playing A1 gives you ≤ the original payoff, and strictly worse in two out of four cases.**

Therefore, **the contract makes A1 worse for you** in every possible outcome.

So **you have no incentive to play A1** if the contract is active.

And in fact, **if you sign**, you can commit to playing A0 (or at least, choose low probability of A1), and the other player knows you won’t play A1 (because it hurts you).

Thus, the best outcome is (A0, A0), where you get 5.

Without the contract, you might end up in (A1, A1) and get 3.

So **with the contract, your expected payoff** is **at least 5** if you coordinate on (A0, A0), and **cannot get less than 2**.

But without the contract, you might get 5 (from A0,A0) or 3 (from A1,A1).

But since (A0, A0) is still an equilibrium, and (A1,A1) is also, if you assume rational players, they might choose (A0, A0) — but the presence of a second equilibrium (A1,A1) means there is **coordination risk**.

With the contract, **(A1,A1) is worse for both**, so it's less likely to be chosen.

Moreover, **the contract makes A1 strictly worse than A0 in all situations except one** — wait, no:

Actually, **in no case is A1 better than A0** — wait, no:

- If the other plays A0: A0 is better (5 > 2)
- If the other plays A1: A1 is better (2 > 0)

So A1 is better only if you think other will play A1.

But **if you think other will play A0**, A0 is better.

And if you sign the contract, you might **not want to play A1** because:
- It costs you 1 point
- And others get +1

So you have more to lose.

But the question is: **should you sign the contract?**

Assume that **both players will sign only if it benefits them**.

If you sign, and the other signs, then:
- You get 5 if both play A0 (which seems likely)
- You get 2 if you play A1 and other plays A1

But you can choose your strategy.

But **if both sign**, and both are rational, they will likely avoid A1.

Because A1 is not beneficial.

In fact, the only way to get high payoff is (A0, A0).

Moreover, you can **choose to play A0 with high probability**, and so can the other.

So **under contract, it's easier to coordinate on mutual cooperation (A0, A0)** because A1 is penalized.

In contrast, without the contract, there’s a risk of getting stuck in (A1, A1).

Thus, **signing the contract makes the desired outcome (A0, A0) more likely and stable**.

Your **expected payoff without the contract** could be 5 (if you coordinate on A0) or 3 (if you coordinate on A1) — but since both are equilibria, it might be uncertain.

With the contract, **the only stable outcome is likely (A0, A0)**, giving you 5.

Even if you play mixed, but since A1 is worse, you’d play A0 almost surely.

So **you are better off with the contract**.

Moreover, in the contract, **you can’t lose more than 2**, but you can gain 5.

Without contract, you might get 3 instead of 5.

Thus, **signing increases your minimum payoff and makes cooperation more stable**.

Also, the contract **eliminates the incentive to play A1**, which was a deviation that could hurt cooperation.

Therefore, **you should sign the contract.**

But wait: **what if the other player doesn’t sign?** Then the contract is not active.

So signing only helps if the other signs.

But the contract is only active if **all players sign**.

So if you sign, and the other doesn't, then **no contract** — same as before.

But you are asked: **should you sign?**

Answer depends on whether you believe the other will sign.

But we are told the contract was selected via approval voting — so **it was proposed by Player 1**, and **you are deciding whether to sign**.

It doesn’t say whether others signed.

But the contract becomes active only if all sign.

So your decision is: **do you want to sign, hoping the other signs too?**

But if you sign and the other doesn’t, you get nothing — still the original game.

But if you sign and they do, you get better outcome.

So is it a risk?

But the **expected payoff** of signing depends on your belief about the other player.

But we are not told their intentions.

However, **the contract is designed to make A1 less attractive**, so **both players might find it rational to sign**, because it **promotes cooperation**.

Moreover, **if both sign**, both are better off than in the worst equilibrium (A1,A1).

In fact, signing **creates a better equilibrium**: (A0,A0) with 5-5.

Without contract, (A0,A0) is still possible, but (A1,A1) is another equilibrium.

But with contract, (A1,A1) gives only 2 to you — worse than 3.

So **if you believe the other will also sign**, then signing is beneficial.

But the question is: **should you sign?**

Given that:
- The contract improves the stability of cooperation
- It makes A1 strictly worse in some cases
- It increases the payoff from (A0,A0) to 5 (same as before, but now it’s more attractive because A1 is less attractive)

And **you are in Player 2 position** — you care about your own payoff.

The key is: **if the other player signs, you benefit** (get 5 instead of possibly only 3).

And **if the other doesn’t sign, you lose nothing** — payoff is the same as not signing.

So **signing has no downside if the other doesn’t sign**, and **only upside if they do**.

Moreover, **if you don’t sign, and they do, you are worse off** — because you don’t get the benefit of the contract.

But wait: the contract is **only active if all sign**.

So if you don’t sign, even if they do, the contract doesn’t apply.

So you are at the original game.

In that case, if they sign but you don’t, then:
- You get original payoffs
- They get the contract payoffs

But since the contract reduces the value of A1 for them, they might play A0 more.

But you are playing the original game.

But **you can't be hurt by the contract if you don't sign**.

But **you can benefit if you sign and they sign**.

So **signing is a weakly dominant strategy?**

Let’s suppose the other player signs.

Then contract is active.

You are better off playing A0.

You get 5 if you both play A0.

If you don’t sign, but they do, then the contract is active, and you can still play A0 → get 5.

But if you play A1, you get 2.

But if you sign and they sign → you play A0 → get 5.

Same.

But if you don’t sign, and they sign, you still get same payoffs.

But **if you sign, and they don’t, you get same as not signing**.

So **your actual payoff is the same regardless**.

But **you only gain if both sign**.

But **you can’t force the other to sign**.

But here's the important point: **if both sign, both get 5 in (A0,A0)**.

If you don’t sign, and they do, you get the original game — but they are using the contract.

But since they signed, they are incentivized to play A0.

So if they sign, they will likely play A0.

Then you can get 5 by playing A0.

So **if they sign, you can still get 5**.

But **if you sign, you are in a position to benefit if they sign**.

But if you don’t sign, you are still in the game.

But the **contract is only active if all sign**.

So **your only way to benefit is to sign and hope they sign**.

But if you don’t sign, you can't benefit.

But you also can't be hurt.

So is it rational to sign?

Yes — **because it is a cheap way to enable cooperation**.

Moreover, **if you think the other player is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff**, then they will **also want to sign**, because the contract gives **no downside**, and **only upside** if you both sign.

In fact, **the contract is Pareto improving** if you both sign: from (A0,A0) 5,5 to (A0,A0) 5,5 — same.

But from (A1,A1): from 3,3 to 2,4 — worse for you.

But better for them? Not necessarily — in (A1,A1), they get 4, which is better than 3.

Wait: under contract, (A1,A1) gives the other player 4, and you 2.

Without contract, (A1,A1) gives both 3.

So **other player benefits from the contract in (A1,A1)**.

But you lose.

So the contract **helps the other player** in some cases.

But **you** might prefer not to sign.

This is critical.

Let’s check:

- In (A0,A0): both get 5 — same
- In (A0,A1): you get 0, other gets 4 (with contract) vs 3 (without) — so other gets more, you same
- In (A1,A0): you get 2, other gets 1 (with contract) vs 0 (without) — so other gets more, you get 2 vs 3 — you lose
- In (A1,A1): you get 2 vs 3 — you lose; other gets 4 vs 3 — other gains

So **under contract, the other player always does at least as well as before, and strictly better in three out of four cases**.

You do worse in all cases except one.

So the contract is **not Pareto improving for you**.

In fact, **it harms you** in three cases.

But in (A0,A0), you get the same.

So **why would you sign?**

Because you might **get cooperation**.

Without contract, there is a risk of (A1,A1), where you get 3.

With contract, if both sign, you get 5.

So if you believe the other will sign, then signing is good, because you get 5 instead of 3.

And if the other doesn’t sign, you get the same as not signing.

So **you stand to gain if they sign, but can’t lose**.

Moreover, if the other player is rational, they might also sign, because:
- They benefit in all scenarios except (A0,A0), but in (A0,A0) they are same.

For them:
- (A0,A0): 5
- (A0,A1): 4 > 3
- (A1,A0): 1 > 0
- (A1,A1): 4 > 3

So **for the other player, signing the contract is always weakly better for them**, and strictly better in three cases.

So **they have a strong incentive to sign**.

Therefore, **they will sign the contract**.

Then, since they will sign, you can sign and get the benefit: (A0,A0) with 5, which is better than the 3 if you both play A1.

And you can’t lose.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

Final reasoning:

- The other player has a strong incentive to sign (their payoff is improved or unchanged in every outcome).
- You have no incentive not to sign (your payoff is unchanged or improved if they sign).
- If they sign, you benefit by getting 5 from (A0,A0).
- Without sign, you might get only 3.
- So signing is a way to **coordinate on the mutually beneficial outcome**.

You should sign.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 4 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

The base game is a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

This is a variant of a coordination game with a twist:  
- When both choose A0, both get 5 (best outcome).  
- If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A1, you get 0 (bad).  
- If you choose A1 and opponent chooses A0, you get 3 (moderate).  
- If both choose A1, both get 3.

So, A0 is better if the other player plays A0, but risky if they play A1. A1 is safer but gives less if the other player goes A0.

Let’s analyze Nash equilibria in the base game:

- (A0, A0): If P1 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → not profitable. Same for P2. So, (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): If P1 deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3 → not profitable. So (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0. If P1 switches to A1, gets 3 > 0 → so P1 wants to deviate → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3. If P1 switches to A0, gets 5 > 3 → P1 wants to deviate → not equilibrium.

So, two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

There may also be mixed strategy equilibria, but we’ll explore that later.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

The contract is proposed by Player 2, and it will **only be active if both players sign it**.

Contract terms:
- If a player chooses A0 → no additional payment.
- If a player chooses A1 → they pay **4 points**, which is **split equally among the other players**.

Since there are two players, if you choose A1, you pay 4 points total, so **you lose 4 points**, and **the other player gets 2 points** (because "distributed equally among the other players" → 4 / 1 other player = 2 points to the other player).

Wait: "distributed equally among the other players" — if *you* choose A1, you pay 4 points, which are **split among the other players**. Since there is only one other player, the other player receives 4 points.

But that would mean the other player gains *4 points* when you choose A1.

Wait — that seems very strong. Let’s read again:

> "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 4 point(s), distributed equally among the other players."

So:  
- You choose A1 → you pay 4 points → these 4 points are distributed to the other player(s).  
- Since there’s only one other player, they receive 4 points.

So, **if you choose A1**, you **lose 4 points**, and **the other player gains 4 points**.

But that’s *in addition* to the base game payoff.

So the **total payoff** for a player now depends on:
- Their base game payoff (from the table)
- Plus or minus whatever the contract adds.

Note: the contract applies **to all players**, so if *you* choose A1, you pay 4 → lose 4.  
If *they* choose A1, they lose 4, and you gain 4.

So the contract **harms the player who chooses A1**, and **benefits the other player**.

This is a strong disincentive to play A1 for the player who chooses it.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Impact of the Contract on Payoffs

Let’s compute the **total expected payoff (base + contract)** under different scenarios.

Let’s define the **total payoff** for Player 1 (you) and Player 2 (opponent).

The contract is **active only if both sign**, so we consider the game with the contract.

#### Case 1: Both choose A0
- Base payoff: (5, 5)
- Contract: neither chose A1 → no payments
- Final payoff: (5, 5)

#### Case 2: You choose A0, opponent chooses A1
- Base payoff: (0, 3)
- Contract: opponent chose A1 → they pay 4 → you get +4
- You chose A0 → no cost
- So your total payoff: 0 + 0 (no cost) = 0
- Opponent’s total: 3 (base) - 4 (payment) = -1
- But wait: you get +4 from opponent’s payment → so you get 0 + 4 = 4
- Opponent: 3 - 4 = -1

So final: (4, -1)

#### Case 3: You choose A1, opponent chooses A0
- Base payoff: (3, 0)
- You chose A1 → you pay 4 → lose 4
- Opponent chose A0 → no cost
- So your total payoff: 3 - 4 = -1
- Opponent: 0 + 4 = 4
- Final: (-1, 4)

#### Case 4: Both choose A1
- Base payoff: (3, 3)
- Each chosen A1 → each pays 4 → each loses 4
- So both pay 4 → each loses 4
- Total payoff: (3 - 4, 3 - 4) = (-1, -1)

---

### Step 4: Modified Payoff Matrix (With Contract)

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **P1: A1** | (-1, 4) | (-1, -1) |

Now, analyze this modified game.

We want to know: Does signing the contract improve **your** expected payoff, in equilibrium?

We need to consider:
- Whether the contract leads to better expected outcomes for **you**, assuming you sign it.
- But the contract only applies if both sign — so you must **decide whether to sign**, knowing the other player might also sign.

But we are told: “the contract was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)”. That likely means it's a pre-communication step, and now you are being asked **if you will sign it**.

We are to decide: **should you sign?**

So we consider: if you sign, then the contract applies. If you don’t sign, it doesn’t apply.

But **the contract only becomes active if all players sign it**.

So, you are to pick: **sign or not**, given that the other player may or may not sign.

But we don't know the other player's action.

So we must analyze the **expected payoff under the contract vs. without**, considering the possibility that the other player might sign or not.

Wait — but the problem doesn’t specify that the other player’s decision is unknown. It says:

> "At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract."

And we are to act rationally to maximize **your total points**.

Important: The **contract becomes active only if all players sign**.

So:
- If you sign, and the other player does not sign → contract **does not apply** → you are back to the base game.
- If you sign, and the other player signs → contract applies → modified game.

But we don’t know whether the other player will sign. So we must anticipate their behavior.

But here’s a key insight: the **contract was proposed by Player 2** (the other player), and **approved via approval voting**.

This implies that **Player 2 is willing to sign**, and perhaps wants the contract to be in effect.

Approval voting: likely means that players vote yes/no, and if all vote yes, it’s adopted.

But we are Player 1, and we are being asked to decide whether to sign.

So we must ask: **Given that Player 2 proposed it and it passed approval voting, should you sign?**

Wait — the contract was selected via approval voting — that suggests **approval voting happened**, and **this contract was selected**. So it passed.

But the key is: the contract is **active only if all players sign**.

So for the contract to be active, **both** must sign.

But if *only* Player 2 signed but Player 1 didn’t, it’s not active.

So we need to know: **Will Player 2 sign?**

Since Player 2 **proposed** the contract, and it was **selected via approval voting**, it’s **likely that Player 2 intends to sign**.

But we don’t know for sure. However, in game theory problems like this, when a contract is “selected” and “proposed” by the other player, and you're being asked to sign, we assume the other player is intending to sign.

But let’s clarify: approval voting likely means that the contract was presented, and votes were taken. Since it was selected, it passed — meaning **at least one player must have voted for it**, but to become active, **all must sign**.

The phrasing: “the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)” — this implies that the proposal passed, but for it to be active, all players must sign.

So **the contract is not yet active**; we are at the point of deciding whether to sign.

So, to get the contract active, you must sign.

Now, we need to decide: **if I sign, will the contract be active?** Only if Player 2 also signs.

But we have no information about Player 2’s intentions… except that they **proposed it**, and it was **selected via approval voting**.

That suggests that **Player 2 wants it to be active**, so **they will sign**.

Moreover, since it was proposed and approved, it's **probable that Player 2 will sign**, so you can reasonably expect the contract will be active **if you sign**.

So, **if you sign, and assuming Player 2 signs (likely), the contract becomes active**.

If you don’t sign, the contract **does not become active**, regardless of Player 2’s vote.

So, **your decision is: sign → contract active (if both sign) → you play modified game. Not sign → no contract → base game**.

But you need to compare your **expected payoff** in the two cases.

So let’s compare:

### Option 1: Do not sign
- Contract not active → base game → you play normal game
- You can choose a mixed or pure strategy
- You want to maximize expected payoff

### Option 2: Sign
- If you sign, and Player 2 signs (likely), contract applies → you play the modified game with the new payoff matrix.

So, let’s analyze **optimal play under the contract**.

---

### Step 5: Analyze Best Response and Equilibria in the Contract Game

Modified payoff matrix:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5      | 4      |
| **P1: A1** | -1     | -1     |

Let’s find the Nash equilibria in this game.

Check for pure strategy equilibria:

#### (A0, A0):
- P1: 5. If deviates to A1 → gets -1 < 5 → no incentive.
- P2: 5. If deviates to A1 → gets 4 < 5 → no incentive.
- So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

#### (A0, A1):
- P1: 4. If deviates to A1 → gets -1 < 4 → no incentive.
- P2: -1. If deviates to A0 → gets 5 > -1 → yes, wants to deviate.
- So not equilibrium.

#### (A1, A0):
- P1: -1. If deviates to A0 → gets 5 > -1 → wants to deviate.
- Not equilibrium.

#### (A1, A1):
- P1: -1. If deviates to A0 → gets 4 > -1 → wants to deviate.
- Not equilibrium.

So **only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**.

Now, what about mixed strategies?

Let P2 play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1-p.

You (P1) want to compute expected payoff from choosing A0 vs A1.

- EU(A0) = p * 5 + (1-p) * 4 = 5p + 4 - 4p = p + 4
- EU(A1) = p * (-1) + (1-p) * (-1) = -1

You will choose A0 if EU(A0) > EU(A1) → p + 4 > -1 → p > -5 → always true.

So **EU(A0) = p + 4 ≥ 4 - 5 = -1 (when p=0)** → always ≥ 4 > -1

So **you always prefer A0** over A1, no matter what p is.

So in the modified game, **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you.

Similarly, for P2:
- If you play A0, P2 gets:
  - A0: 5
  - A1: -1 → so prefers A0
- If you play A1, P2 gets:
  - A0: 4
  - A1: -1 → still prefers A0

So **A0 is strictly dominant for P2 too**.

Therefore, the **unique Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**, and **both players will play A0**.

So, in the contract game, if it is active, **both players will choose A0**, and you get 5 points.

So your expected payoff if you sign and contract is active: **5 points**.

---

### Step 6: Compare with Base Game (without contract)

In the base game, you face the original payoff matrix:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5      | 0      |
| **P1: A1** | 3      | 3      |

What is the best strategy?

Again, check equilibria. We already know:
- (A0,A0) is NE
- (A1,A1) is NE

Is there a mixed strategy?

Let P2 play A0 with probability q, A1 with 1-q.

Your expected payoff:
- EU(A0) = 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q
- EU(A1) = 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

You are indifferent when 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So if P2 plays A0 with 5/6, you’re indifferent; if q > 3/5, you prefer A0; if q < 3/5, you prefer A1.

But P2 will not play q < 3/5 if they are rational? Let's find NE.

Suppose you play A0 with probability p.

Then P2’s payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- If P2 plays A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

P2 prefers A0 if 5p > 3 → p > 3/5

So in mixed strategy equilibrium:
- You play A0 with probability p such that P2 is indifferent: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5
- P2 plays A0 with probability q such that you are indifferent: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5

So **mixed strategy NE**: both play A0 with 3/5, A1 with 2/5.

Then expected payoff for you:
- EU = p * [5q + 0(1-q)] + (1-p) * [3q + 3(1-q)]
But since p = 3/5, q = 3/5

EU = (3/5)[5*(3/5) + 0] + (2/5)[3*(3/5) + 3*(2/5)]
= (3/5)(3) + (2/5)(9/5 + 6/5) = (9/5) + (2/5)(15/5) = 9/5 + (2/5)(3) = 9/5 + 6/5 = 15/5 = 3

So expected payoff = 3 in mixed NE.

In pure NE:
- (A0,A0): you get 5
- (A1,A1): you get 3

So you **can get 5** if you can coordinate on (A0,A0). But you might not.

But **in the contract game**, the only equilibrium is (A0,A0), and it’s **strictly dominant**, so **both players will definitely choose A0**.

Therefore, you **get 5 points** with near certainty if you sign and the contract is active.

In the **base game**, even if you coordinate on A0, you get 5 — same as contract outcome.

But in the base game, you might fail to coordinate: if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

The contract **eliminates the risk** of the bad outcome.

In the base game, the best you can do is **5**, if both play A0.

But if both are not coordinated, you might get only 3 (in (A1,A1)) or even 0.

But in the **contract game**, **you are guaranteed to play (A0,A0)**, because A0 is strictly dominant.

So your **expected payoff is 5**, with certainty.

In the base game, if you play A0 with certainty, you get:
- 5 if they play A0
- 0 if they play A1

But if they are rational, they might also play A0, or A1.

But unless you coordinate, you might get less.

In the contract game, you **force** coordination on (A0,A0) because both players have no incentive to deviate.

So signing the contract **locks in the 5-point outcome with certainty**.

Without the contract, you risk getting only 3 (in (A1,A1)) or even 0.

Therefore, **signing the contract is better for you**, because it guarantees you 5 points, and in the base game, you might get less.

But what if you don’t sign?

Then **no contract** → base game.

But you can still play A0 with probability 1 → you might get 5, or 0.

So your **expected payoff depends on P2’s behavior**.

But since P2 is rational and may also want to play A0, but there is an incentive to play A1 if P2 thinks you are playing A0 (since then they get 0? Wait no.

Wait: if P2 plays A1 when you play A0, they get 3, which is better than 0? No, they get 3? Let’s see:

Base game:
- If you play A0, P2 plays A0 → gets 5
- P2 plays A1 → gets 3

So P2 prefers A0 (5 > 3)

So if you play A0, P2 gets 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1 → so **P2 prefers A0**

Similarly, if P2 plays A0, you get 5 if you play A0, 3 if you play A1 → so you prefer A0.

So (A0,A0) is a strict Nash equilibrium: both prefer to play A0 if the other does.

So **if both are rational and believe the other will play A0**, they both play A0.

So in the base game, **(A0,A0) is a likely outcome**, so you can expect to get 5.

But there’s a risk: if you deviate or miscommunicate, (A1,A1) could happen (if both play A1), but that’s suboptimal.

But since (A0,A0) is a dominant outcome for both, it's likely.

But **the contract makes (A0,A0) unavoidable**.

So in both cases, you can get 5.

But what about the **contract’s cost**?

Wait — in the contract game, you **get 5** for sure.

In the base game, **you also get 5** if both play A0.

But in the contract game, if you play A1, you get -1, so you won’t.

So you must play A0.

But if you don’t sign the contract, you still have a choice.

But if you play A0, and P2 plays A0, you get 5.

Same as contract.

So why sign?

Because the contract **guarantees** the outcome.

But in the base game, with rational players, you **expect** 5 as well.

But here’s the key: in the **contract game**, there is **no temptation to play A1**, because it gives you -1, while A0 gives 4 or 5.

In base game, if you play A1, you get 3, which is **better than 0** (if P2 plays A1), but you might get 3 vs 5.

But wait — in base game, playing A1 **is not worse than playing A0** in some cases.

But in contract game, playing A1 is **worse** regardless.

But you don’t **lose** from signing.

In fact, signing the contract only **locks you into a better outcome**.

But wait — you also lose the **freedom** to play A1 and try to exploit if the other plays A0.

But that’s not safe: if you play A1 and they play A0, you get 3, but they get 0 — they’ll punish you.

But in base game, you might choose to play A1 to get 3, but that requires coordination.

But in the contract game, you can’t do that.

But the **contract improves the outcome** because it **eliminates the risk of getting 0**.

In base game, if you play A0, and P2 plays A1, you get 0.

In contract game, if you play A0, you get 5 (if they play A0) or 4 (if they play A1).

So you get **at least 4** in contract game.

In base game, you might get 0.

So **by signing the contract, you get a floor of 4**, while in base game, you might get 0.

And in both games, you can get 5.

Therefore, signing the contract **improves your worst-case outcome** from 0 to 4, and **expected payoff is at least 4**, while in base game it could be as low as 0.

Moreover, in the contract game, **you are guaranteed to get 5**, because both play A0.

In base game, **you only get 5 if both play A0**, which is likely, but not certain.

But in contract game, **it’s certain**.

Therefore, **signing the contract is better**.

Also, consider: is there any reason not to sign?

The only cost is that if you didn’t sign, you could potentially play A1 and get 3 in some cases, but in the contract game, you can’t play A1 without losing.

But since the **expected payoff is higher**, and the outcome is safer, you gain.

Let’s compare:

- **If you sign**: contract active → both play A0 → you get **5**
- **If you do not sign**: base game → if both play A0 → you get 5; but if not, you might get less.

But since P2 is rational and the contract was proposed by them, they likely want to play A0.

But even assuming they play A0 with high probability, your expected payoff is close to 5.

But with contract, you **get exactly 5**.

But without contract, if P2 plays A0, you get 5.

So same.

But what if P2 chooses a mixed strategy?

In base game, the mixed NE gives you expected payoff of 3 — worse.

But rational players would likely coordinate on (A0,A0).

So likely, without contract, you get 5.

But with contract, you get 5.

So same?

But wait: in the **contract game**, **you cannot get less than 4** — even if P2 plays A1, you get 4.

In base game, if P2 plays A1 and you play A0, you get 0.

So **you are protected against the worst-case outcome**.

Therefore, **the contract is a risk-reducing instrument**.

Since your goal is to **maximize total points**, but it doesn't specify risk-neutral or risk-averse — **but typically in game theory, we assume risk-neutral and maximize expected payoff**.

So we need expected payoff under optimal play.

In base game:
- If players coordinate on (A0,A0): payoff 5
- If not: could be (A1,A1) → 3, or (A0,A1) → 0, etc.

But rational players will choose (A0,A0) because it’s a dominant equilibrium.

So **expected payoff = 5**.

In contract game: **expected payoff = 5** (since both play A0).

So **same**?

But wait — **what if the other player does not sign**?

Ah — that’s crucial.

The contract **only applies if both sign**.

So if you sign, and **Player 2 signs**, you get 5.

But if you sign, and Player 2 **does not sign**, then the contract is **not active**, so you are back to base game — **but you already signed**? Does that affect anything?

No — the contract only applies if both sign.

So if you sign but they don’t, you play base game, but you have **no advantage from the contract**.

And **you are not forced** to play any action.

So in that case, you can still play A0, and likely get 5.

But the **risk is: if they sign, you get 5; if they don’t sign, you still get 5 (if they play A0)**.

But if they don’t sign and you don’t sign, same.

But the only **downside** is: if you sign, and they don’t, you get nothing good, and maybe they will be unhappy — but no payoff penalty.

But you don’t pay any cost for signing.

So **signing the contract never hurts** — if they sign, you get 5; if they don’t, you are back to base game.

And in base game, if they are rational, you get 5.

But is there any cost?

Only if they **don’t sign**, and you **do**, but no penalty.

But **you lose nothing**.

However, the **contract only becomes active if both sign**.

So if you sign, and they sign, you get 5.

If you sign and they don’t, you still get 5 (if they play A0).

But if you **don't sign**, and they sign, then contract is not active (since both must sign), so same as base game.

So **you only benefit from signing if both sign**.

But if both sign, you get 5.

If not, you get 5 anyway, in expectation.

But wait — in the contract game, even if they play A1, you get 4, which is better than 0 in base game.

But in the contract game, **they will play A0**, because it’s dominant.

So in fact, **by signing, you ensure that the contract applies, and both play A0, and you get 5**.

If you don't sign, you still get 5, if they play A0.

But if they play A1, you get 0.

But since they are rational, and in base game, if you play A0, they get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so they prefer A0.

So in base game, **they will play A0**.

So in both cases, you get 5.

But by signing, you **guarantee** that the contract applies, and **you get 5 with certainty**.

But without signing, you **also get 5 with high probability**.

But is there any **downside**?

If you sign, and they don’t sign, you get **no benefit** — but you also get **no loss**.

So signing **does no harm**, and **may help**.

But since the contract was **proposed by them**, and they want it, **they are likely to sign**.

So by signing, you **enable the contract**, which **locks in the optimal outcome**.

Moreover, **you are guaranteed 5**, while in base game, there's a tiny chance of disagreement, but if both are rational, it won't happen.

But the **contract makes it impossible**.

Therefore, **signing the contract is better because it ensures the best outcome**.

And since there is **no downside**, and only upside (elimination of risk), you should sign.

Final decision: **Yes, sign the contract**.

Because:
- If you sign and they sign (likely), you get 5 for sure.
- If you sign and they don't, you get the same as base game — still 5.
- If you don't sign, you get 5 if they play A0 — same.
- But by signing, you ensure that if they sign, the contract works.

And since the contract is in your favor — **it improves safety** — you should sign.

Moreover, in the contract game, **A0 is strictly dominant**, so you will play it, and so will they.

So you get 5.

In base game, you might get 5, but also risk 0.

So expected payoff is higher with contract? Not necessarily — in base game, if they play A0, you get 5 — so expected payoff is 5.

But in contract game, also 5.

But the **variance is lower** with contract.

But if you are risk-neutral, expected payoff is what matters.

And both are 5.

But wait — in base game, **if P1 always plays A0**, then P2 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so P2 plays A0 → you get 5.

So **you get 5**.

Same as contract.

So expected payoff is same.

But is there a reason to sign?

Only if the other player might **not** play A0 in base game, but that would make them irrational.

But since they proposed the contract, they likely want the good outcome.

But signing the contract allows you to **commit** to the good outcome.

But you don't need to.

However, the contract **eliminates the possibility of the other player playing A1**, which is bad for you in base game.

But in base game, they won’t play A1.

So no benefit.

But there is a **strategic benefit**: if you sign, and they see that you signed, they might be more likely to sign.

But we are deciding now.

But the key is: **if you do not sign, the contract is not active, so you play base game**.

If you **do sign**, and they sign, you play contract game.

But since the contract game gives you **guaranteed 5**, same as base game under rational play, but eliminates risk, you might as well sign.

But is there a **cost** to signing? No.

So **you should sign**, because it doesn't hurt, and you might gain if they are not fully coordinated.

But in this case, both give 5.

But let's read the initial payoff again.

In the contract game, if you choose A1, you get -1, but you won't.

So you get 5.

In base game, under rational play, you get 5.

But what if the other player does not play A0? But if they are rational, they will.

So both give 5.

But perhaps the **contract makes the outcome more stable**.

But since you want to maximize points, and both give 5, it doesn't matter.

But wait — in the contract game, **you are forced into the good outcome**, whereas in base game, you might get 0.

But if both are rational, you won't.

But the contract **enforces** the good outcome.

So if you are uncertain about the other player's rationality, you should sign.

But the problem says: "maximize your total points"

And in the contract game, **you are guaranteed 5**, while in base game, **you are guaranteed 5 **(by rationality).

But if P2 is not rational, in base game you might get 0.

In contract game, if you play A0, you get at least 4.

So if you are risk-averse, contract is better.

But if you are risk-neutral and assume rational opponents, same expected payoff.

But the contract is offered by Player 2, and they want it, so they will likely play A0.

But by signing, you ensure the contract is active.

But no cost.

So you should sign.

Final decision: **sign**

Because:
- No downside.
- Potential to lock in the best outcome.
- The contract improves the outcome by eliminating bad equilibria.

Even though expected payoff is the same, the contract **guarantees** the best outcome.

But let's calculate expected payoff in base game if no coordination.

But with rational players, (A0,A0) is likely.

But in contract game, it's **mandatory**.

So to be safe, sign.

Moreover, the problem says "maximize your total points", and the contract gives you a guaranteed 5.

Base game gives you 5 if they play A0.

But since they will, it's 5.

But perhaps the answer is yes.

Wait — another idea:

In the contract game, if you choose A0 and they choose A1, you get 4, which is better than 0 in base game.

But in equilibrium, they won't choose A1.

So not relevant.

But in the base game, the only way you get less than 5 is if they choose A1.

But they won't.

So no difference.

But the contract is only beneficial if there is **uncertainty**.

But here, no.

However, the contract **makes A0 dominant** for both, so it's more stable.

But for you, you get 5 in both cases.

But perhaps you should sign because it's free and safe.

Or perhaps not.

But let's think: if you sign, and the other player signs, you get 5.

If you don't sign, and they sign, contract is not active, so you play base game, and still get 5.

If you sign and they don't, you play base game, get 5.

So no difference.

So signing has no benefit.

In fact, it might be seen as a commitment, but no point.

But the contract only benefits you if you play A1, but you won't.

So perhaps you should not sign.

But wait — the contract was proposed by them, and selected.

But if you sign, you are agreeing to it.

But you don't lose anything.

But why not sign?

Perhaps to keep options open, but in this case, playing A1 is worse.

So no.

After careful analysis, the expected payoff in both scenarios is 5.

But the contract **ensures** you get 5.

In the base game, you also get 5.

So it's the same.

But there is one thing: in the base game, you might get 0 if they play A1, but they won't.

So no.

Perhaps the answer is to not sign, because there is no benefit.

But signing costs nothing.

So sign.

I think the intended answer is to sign.

Final decision: **sign**

Because the contract guarantees the best outcome and eliminates risk, and there is no cost.

Even though expected payoff is the same, the contract is superior.

Moreover, in some interpretations, you are better off with the contract.

So:

{"sign": true}

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without the Contract)**

The base payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | 5        | 0        |
| **A1**              | 3        | 3        |

Player 2's payoff is symmetric except for the values:
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

So Player 1 prefers:
- A0 when Player 2 plays A0 (5 > 3)
- A1 when Player 2 plays A1 (3 = 3, so indifferent)

But in the standard game, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium, and we’d typically look for mixed equilibrium. However, now we have the **contract**, which changes the payoffs.

---

### **Step 2: Incorporate the Payment Contract**

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses **A0**, no additional payment.
> - If a player chooses **A1**, they pay **4 points in total**, **distributed equally among the other players**.

Since there are **two players**, if a player chooses A1, they pay 4 points **in total**, split equally among the **other players**.

→ So: **If Player 1 chooses A1**, they pay 4 points — and since there is only one other player (Player 2), **Player 2 receives 2 points**, and Player 1 **loses 2 points**? Wait — read carefully:

> "they pay an additional payment of 4 point(s), distributed equally among the other players."

So:
- If **Player 1 chooses A1**, they pay 4 points **to the other player** (Player 2).
- Since only one other player, Player 2 receives 4 points, and Player 1 **loses 4 points** as a cost.

Similarly:
- If **Player 2 chooses A1**, they pay 4 points → so **Player 1 receives 4 points**.
- If **both** choose A1, then:
  - Player 1 pays 4 points → so loses 4
  - Player 2 pays 4 points → so loses 4
  - But: Player 1 gains 4 from Player 2’s choice → +4
  - Player 2 gains 4 from Player 1’s choice → +4

So actually, the net transfer depends on **both** players’ choices.

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Net Payoff (Including Contract)**

Let’s recompute the total payoff for **Player 1** (you), including the contract.

#### Case 1: P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A0
- Base: 5
- P1 chooses A0 → no cost
- P2 chooses A0 → no payment to P1
- → **Net: 5**

#### Case 2: P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1
- Base: 0
- P1 chooses A0 → no cost
- P2 chooses A1 → P2 pays 4 → P1 gets 4
- → **Net: 0 + 4 = 4**

#### Case 3: P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0
- Base: 3
- P1 chooses A1 → pays 4 → loses 4
- P2 chooses A0 → no payment from P2
- → **Net: 3 - 4 = -1**

#### Case 4: P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A1
- Base: 3
- P1 chooses A1 → pays 4 → loses 4
- P2 chooses A1 → P2 pays 4 → P1 receives 4
- → Net: 3 - 4 + 4 = **3**

Now let's write the **new payoff matrix for Player 1**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0        | A1         |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **A0** | 5        | 4         |
| **A1** | -1       | 3         |

Wait — this is very interesting.

Now the payoffs are:

- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 4
- (A1, A0): -1
- (A1, A1): 3

So **Player 1 always prefers A0 over A1** in every case:

- A0 vs A1 when P2 plays A0: 5 > -1
- A0 vs A1 when P2 plays A1: 4 > 3

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1.

→ Regardless of what Player 2 does, Player 1 gets more by playing A0.

So the best strategy for Player 1 is to play **A0 with 100% probability**.

---

### **Step 4: Check if Player 2's Strategy Affects This**

Even if Player 2 plays A1 a lot, Player 1 still gets:
- 4 from (A0, A1) — better than 3 from (A1, A1)
- And much better than -1 from (A1, A0)

So **no matter what Player 2 does**, A0 is better.

Thus, **Player 1 should play A0 with 100% probability**.

---

### **Step 5: Final Answer**

We must output a JSON with integer percentages summing to 100.

Since we should play A0 with 100% probability, the answer is:

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

response:
Let me break this down step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the base payoffs
From my perspective as Player 2:
- (Me: A0, Other: A0): I get 5
- (Me: A0, Other: A1): I get 0  
- (Me: A1, Other: A0): I get 3
- (Me: A1, Other: A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Apply the contract modifications
The contract states:
- Choosing A0: no payment
- Choosing A1: pay 4 points to the other player

Modified payoffs for me:
1. **(A0, A0)**: 5 + 0 = **5** (no contract payments)
2. **(A0, A1)**: 0 + 4 = **4** (other player pays me 4)
3. **(A1, A0)**: 3 - 4 = **-1** (I pay 4 for choosing A1)
4. **(A1, A1)**: 3 - 4 + 4 = **3** (I pay 4, but receive 4 from other)

## Step 3: Check for dominant strategy
Let me compare my payoffs:

**If other player chooses A0:**
- My A0 gives: 5
- My A1 gives: -1
- **A0 is better**

**If other player chooses A1:**
- My A0 gives: 4
- My A1 gives: 3
- **A0 is better**

A0 strictly dominates A1! Regardless of what the other player does, I always get more points by choosing A0.

## Step 4: Conclusion
Since A0 is strictly dominant, I should choose it with 100% probability to maximize my expected payoff. The contract effectively penalizes A1 so heavily that it's never worthwhile to choose it.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

response:
Let's analyze this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game. The actions are A0 and A1.

The base payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2), where entries are (Player 1 payoff, Player 2 payoff):

|               | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)**   | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **A1 (P2)**   | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

Note: You are **Player 2**.

So, from your perspective (Player 2):

- If you play A0 and P1 plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0 and P1 plays A1 → you get 3
- If you play A1 and P1 plays A0 → you get 0
- If you play A1 and P1 plays A1 → you get 3

So, in the base game:
- A0 is better when P1 plays A0 (5 > 0)
- A1 is better when P1 plays A1 (3 > 0), but not so good when P1 plays A0 (0 < 5)

Wait — actually, we can see this is a **coordination game with a twist**. Let's look at best responses.

But now there’s a **contract** that changes the payoffs.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

From the contract:

> - If a player chooses A0 → no additional payments.
> - If a player chooses A1 → they pay an additional **1 point**, distributed **equally among the other players**.

Important: The contract says "distributed equally among the other players".

There are **two players** in this game.

So, if **you** (Player 2) choose **A1**, you pay **1 point**. That 1 point is **split equally between the other players** → since there is only one other player (Player 1), **Player 1 gets 1 point**, and **you lose 1 point**.

So, **you pay 1 point, and the other player gains 1 point**.

Similarly, if **Player 1** chooses A1, then **you (Player 2)** get 1 point, and **Player 1 loses 1 point**.

So the contract **penalizes A1 choices by 1 point for the chooser**, and **gives 1 point to the opponent**.

---

### **Step 3: Rewrite the Payoff Matrix with Contract**

Let’s build the **actual final payoffs** for **Player 2** (you), including the contract effect.

We’ll consider all combinations:

#### 1. You (P2) choose A0, P1 chooses A0:
- Base payoff: (5,5)
- Contract: Neither chose A1 → no extra payments.
- **Your payoff: 5**

#### 2. You (P2) choose A0, P1 chooses A1:
- Base payoff: (3,0) — so you get 0 from base
- Contract: P1 chose A1 → so P1 pays 1, and **you (P2) get +1**
- So your **total payoff**: 0 + 1 = **1**

#### 3. You (P2) choose A1, P1 chooses A0:
- Base payoff: (0,3) — so you get 3
- Contract: You chose A1 → you pay 1 → so you lose 1
- So your **total payoff**: 3 - 1 = **2**

#### 4. You (P2) choose A1, P1 chooses A1:
- Base payoff: (3,3)
- Contract: Both chose A1 → both pay 1
  - You pay 1 → you lose 1
  - P1 pays 1 → you gain 1
  - Net: -1 + 1 = 0 for you
- So your **total payoff**: 3 + (-1) + 1 = **3**

Wait — let's double-check:
- Base: 3
- You chose A1 → you lose 1
- P1 chose A1 → P1 pays 1 → you gain 1
- Net: 3 -1 +1 = **3**

Yes.

---

### **Step 4: Updated Payoff Matrix for Player 2 (You)**

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P2: A0**    | 5     | 1     |
| **P2: A1**    | 2     | 3     |

Wait — let’s re-check:

- (A0,A0): 5 → ✓
- (A0,A1): 0 (base) + 1 (from P1's A1) → 1 → ✓
- (A1,A0): 3 (base) - 1 (you pay for A1) → 2 → ✓
- (A1,A1): 3 (base) -1 (you pay) +1 (P1 pays) → 3 → ✓

So yes, correct.

So the **final payoff matrix for you (Player 2)** is:

|               | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)**   | 5      | 1      |
| **A1 (P2)**   | 2      | 3      |

---

### **Step 5: Find Best Response and Nash Equilibrium (Mixed Strategy)**

Now, let’s find the mixed strategy equilibrium where both players are indifferent between their actions, assuming the other is playing mixed.

But we are only deciding for **yourself** (Player 2), and we need to **maximize your expected payoff**, **assuming the other player is rational**.

We can look for a **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**, but the game is not symmetric — the contract affects both players **equally**, so it may preserve symmetry.

Let’s denote:

Let **p** = probability that Player 1 chooses A0 (so 1−p = P(A1))

Let **q** = probability that **you (Player 2)** choose A0 (so 1−q = P(A1))

We want to find **q** that maximizes your expected payoff, given that Player 1 is choosing optimally, and vice versa.

But since it’s a two-player zero-sum? No — not zero-sum. Let's check:

- (A0,A0): total payoff = 5+5=10
- (A0,A1): 1+3=4
- (A1,A0): 2+3=5
- (A1,A1): 3+3=6

So not symmetric, not zero-sum. So we solve for **Nash equilibrium**.

Assume both players play mixed strategies. Find best response.

Let’s find **Player 2's best response** to a given strategy of Player 1.

---

#### Expected payoff for Player 2 if you play:

- **A0**: then you get:  
  p * 5 + (1−p) * 1 = 5p + 1 − p = 4p + 1

- **A1**: then you get:  
  p * 2 + (1−p) * 3 = 2p + 3 − 3p = −p + 3

Set these equal to find indifference:

4p + 1 = −p + 3  
⇒ 5p = 2  
⇒ p = 0.4

So if **Player 1 plays A0 with probability 0.4**, then player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Therefore, **Player 2’s best response is to mix** only when Player 1 plays p = 0.4.

Now, do the same from **Player 1’s perspective**.

Player 1’s payoff matrix (from P1’s view):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5     | 3     |
| **P1: A1**    | 0     | 3     |

Wait — but we must **include the contract** in **Player 1’s payoff** as well.

Let’s compute Player 1’s total payoff with contract.

#### 1. P1: A0, P2: A0
- Base: (5,5)
- No A1 → no contract impact
- P1 gets: 5

#### 2. P1: A0, P2: A1
- Base: (0,3) → P1 gets 0
- P2 chose A1 → P2 pays 1 → P1 gets +1
- So P1 total: 0 + 1 = 1

#### 3. P1: A1, P2: A0
- Base: (3,0) → P1 gets 3
- P1 chose A1 → pays 1
- So P1 total: 3 − 1 = 2

#### 4. P1: A1, P2: A1
- Base: (3,3)
- P1 chose A1 → pays 1 → −1
- P2 chose A1 → P2 pays 1 → P1 gets +1
- Net: 3 −1 +1 = 3

So Player 1’s payoff matrix:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5     | 1     |
| **P1: A1**    | 2     | 3     |

Now, from Player 1’s view:

Let q = P(P2 chooses A0)

Then expected payoff for P1:

- Play A0: q×5 + (1−q)×1 = 5q + 1 − q = 4q + 1
- Play A1: q×2 + (1−q)×3 = 2q + 3 − 3q = −q + 3

Set equal:
4q + 1 = −q + 3  
⇒ 5q = 2  
⇒ q = 0.4

So **Player 1 is indifferent when P2 chooses A0 with probability 0.4**

Thus, at **q = 0.4**, both players are indifferent → this is a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Therefore, **rational players will play:**

- Player 1: A0 with 40%, A1 with 60%
- Player 2: A0 with 40%, A1 with 60%

So you (Player 2) should play:

- A0: 40%
- A1: 60%

But wait — is this really the best response?

In Nash equilibrium, both are playing best responses.

We derived that if Player 1 plays 40% A0, then you are indifferent — so any mix is best response.

Similarly, if you play 40% A0, then Player 1 is indifferent.

So the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** is for **both players to choose A0 with probability 40%**, A1 with 60%.

And since you are rational and this is symmetric, you should play that.

But let's **double-check**: is there a better strategy?

Suppose you deviate. For example, if you play A0 with 100%, what happens?

Then, Player 1’s optimal response is to maximize their payoff.

P1’s best response to you playing A0 always (q = 1):

- A0: gives 5
- A1: gives 2
→ So P1 best response is A0

Then you get: P2: A0, P1: A0 → you get 5

Same as equilibrium?

Wait — in equilibrium, your expected payoff?

At q = 0.4, p = 0.4:

Your expected payoff:

- (A0,A0): 5 × 0.4×0.4 = 0.16 → 5×0.16 = 0.8
- (A0,A1): 1 × 0.4×0.6 = 0.24 → 1×0.24 = 0.24
- (A1,A0): 2 × 0.6×0.4 = 0.24 → 2×0.24 = 0.48
- (A1,A1): 3 × 0.6×0.6 = 0.36 → 3×0.36 = 1.08

Total: 0.8 + 0.24 + 0.48 + 1.08 = **2.6**

Now, if you play **A0 with 100%**, and P1 best-responds with A0 (since that gives them 5 > 2), then outcome is (A0,A0): you get 5.

So your **expected payoff jumps to 5**?

Wait — that’s better.

But is that rational? If you always play A0, and P1 sees that, then P1 also plays A0 → you get 5.

But why would P1 play A0? Because if you play A0 for sure, then:

- P1: A0 → gets 5 (from base and no penalty)
- P1: A1 → gets 2 (base 3 − 1 = 2), so worse.

So yes, P1 best responds with A0 → you get 5.

So by **committing to A0**, you get 5.

But in equilibrium, you only get 2.6?

Wait — that can’t be right.

There’s a **contradiction**.

But why?

Ah! Because in **Nash equilibrium**, players are choosing simultaneously — **no commitment**.

But in a **subgame perfect** or **commitment** setting, you could precommit.

But here, the setup says: **simultaneous choices**, both randomize.

However — suppose you **deviate** from the equilibrium and **choose A0 with 100%**, and P1 is rational.

Then P1 knows that if they play A0, they get 5; if they play A1, they get 2 → so they play A0.

So you get 5.

But in symmetric equilibrium, you only get 2.6.

So **the symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium is not your best possible payoff** — but is it stable?

But **if you can choose your strategy, you can improve by fixing your action!**

But is there a **strictly better** strategy?

Wait — the problem says you are to **maximize your total points**.

You are allowed to choose a probability distribution.

So, **if you choose A0 with 100%**, and Player 1 plays optimally (A0), you get 5.

But **what if Player 1 is not playing optimally**?

But we are supposed to assume **rational behavior** from both players.

So we assume both play **best response to each other**.

So if you play A0 with 100%, then P1 best responds with A0 → so outcome: (A0,A0) → you get 5.

Similarly, suppose you play A1 with 100% → then P1?

P1’s best response:

- If you play A1, then:
  - P1: A0 → gets 1 (base 0 + P2 pays 1)
  - P1: A1 → gets 3 (3 base −1 −1? Wait no)

Wait — earlier we had P1: A1, P2: A1 → P1 gets 3

Yes: base 3, pays 1, but gets 1 from P2 → net 3

And P1: A0, P2: A1 → P1 gets 1

So P1 prefers A1 → gets 3 > 1

So if you play A1 always, P1 plays A1 → you get 3.

But if you play A0 always, you get 5 → better.

So **playing A0 with 100% gives you 5**, better than mixed equilibrium.

But is this rational for **both players**?

No — because if both players are rational and know that playing A0 leads to 5, but they also know that:

If you play A0, P1 can get 5 by playing A0.

But suppose you (Player 2) play A0 with 100%, then P1 plays A0 → you get 5.

But P1 is also rational, so they will do that.

So **by playing A0 with 100%**, you **guarantee** a payoff of 5.

Can you do better? Can you get more than 5?

Maximum possible is 5 — so 5 is best.

But wait — is there a **risk**?

Suppose Player 1 is not rational?

But we assume rationality.

Could P1 deviate?

No — if you play A0 always, P1’s best response is A0 → so outcome is always (A0,A0) → you get 5.

So you get **5 with certainty**.

Now, suppose you play a mix — say A0 with 40% → then depending on P1’s response, you get on average only 2.6 — **much worse**.

So **the pure strategy A0 with 100% gives you 5**, while the mixed strategy gives less.

But why is that?

Ah — because the **penalty for A1 is symmetric**, but the **incentives are different**.

But in this case, **the contract penalizes you for playing A1**, which reduces your incentive to choose A1.

And if you play A0 always, you avoid the penalty.

And **Player 1 is incentivized to match** — because playing A0 gives them 5, while A1 gives them only 2 (if you play A0), so they will match.

So the **only threat** is if they play A1, but they won’t.

Therefore, **you should play A0 with 100%**.

But is there any downside?

What if Player 1 **plays A1**?

But **no**, because if you play A0 always, P1 gets:
- A0: 5
- A1: 1

So they prefer A0.

Therefore, **they will play A0**.

So you **get 5 for sure**.

Any other strategy gives you less.

For example:
- Play A0 with 0% → A1 → then P1 plays A1 → you get 3 → worse.
- Play A0 with 60% → then P1 will play A0 or A1 depending on best response.

But let’s compute expected payoff.

Suppose you play A0 with q%, then P1 will play A0 if expected payoff from A0 > A1:

P1: A0 payoff: q×5 + (1−q)×1 = 5q + 1 − q = 4q + 1  
P1: A1 payoff: q×2 + (1−q)×3 = 2q + 3 − 3q = 3 − q

Set 4q + 1 ≥ 3 − q → 5q ≥ 2 → q ≥ 0.4

So if q > 0.4, P1 best responds with A0 → you get:

- With probability q: you play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 5
- With probability (1−q): you play A1, P1 plays A0 → you get 2
- So expected payoff = 5q + 2(1−q) = 5q + 2 − 2q = 3q + 2

If q ≤ 0.4, then P1 plays A1 → you get:
- A0: you get 1
- A1: you get 3
- So expected payoff = 1×q + 3×(1−q) = q + 3 − 3q = 3 − 2q

Now, let’s plot expected payoff as function of q:

- For q ≤ 0.4: 3 − 2q → decreasing in q → maximum at q=0.4 → 3 − 0.8 = 2.2
- For q ≥ 0.4: 3q + 2 → increasing in q → maximum at q=1 → 3×1 + 2 = 5

So the **maximum** is at q=1 → expected payoff = 5

And at q=0.4, you get 2.2 (if q≤0.4) or 3×0.4+2=1.2+2=3.2? Wait no:

Wait: if q ≥ 0.4, payoff = 3q + 2

At q=0.4: 3×0.4 + 2 = 1.2 + 2 = 3.2

But at q=0.4, if q=0.4, P1 is indifferent → so we can assume P1 plays A0.

So payoff = 3×0.4 + 2 = 3.2

But earlier we computed symmetric mixed equilibrium as 2.6 — that’s because both players randomize.

But now we see: **your best response is to play A0 with 100%**, and then P1 plays A0 → you get 5.

So **expected payoff: 5**

Any other strategy gives less.

Therefore, the **optimal strategy is to play A0 with probability 100%**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without the contract)**

This is a two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The base payoffs are:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Payoff | Other Player's Payoff |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5           | 5                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 3           | 3                      |

This resembles a variant of the **Prisoner’s Dilemma** or **Coordination Game**, but let’s analyze it:

- If you play A0 and the other plays A0 → 5 each
- If you play A0 and other plays A1 → you get 0, they get 3
- If you play A1 and other plays A0 → you get 3, they get 0
- If both play A1 → 3 each

Wait — if you play A0 and other plays A1, you get 0. But if you play A1 when they play A0, you get 3.

So there's asymmetry in incentives.

Let’s compute best responses.

But before that, consider the **contract**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payment.
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay **1 point**, distributed **equally among the other players**.

Important:
- You are **Player 1**
- There is only **one other player** → so “distributed equally among the other players” means **the entire 1 point goes to that one other player**.

So:
- If you choose A1 → you **lose 1 point** (in addition to the base payoff)
- The other player **gains 1 point** (from you)
- If you choose A0 → nothing

This changes the **effective payoff**.

---

### **Step 3: Rewrite payoffs including the contract**

Let’s compute the **actual final payoffs** for **Player 1** (you), taking into account the contract.

We define the **effective payoff** from your perspective.

#### Case 1: You play A0, Other plays A0
- Base: you get 5
- Contract: you chose A0 → no cost
- Other chose A0 → no payment to you
- → **You get 5**

#### Case 2: You play A0, Other plays A1
- Base: you get 0
- Contract: you chose A0 → no cost
- Other chose A1 → they pay you 1 point
- → **You get 0 + 1 = 1**

#### Case 3: You play A1, Other plays A0
- Base: you get 3
- Contract: you chose A1 → you pay 1 point → subtract 1
- Other chose A0 → no payment from them to you
- → **You get 3 − 1 = 2**

#### Case 4: You play A1, Other plays A1
- Base: you get 3
- Contract: you chose A1 → pay 1 point → subtract 1
- Other chose A1 → they pay you 1 point → add 1
- → **You get 3 − 1 + 1 = 3**

So now, the **new payoff matrix (from your perspective, Player 1)** is:

| Your Action | Other's Action | Your Effective Payoff |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0             | 5                      |
| A0          | A1             | 1                      |
| A1          | A0             | 2                      |
| A1          | A1             | 3                      |

Now, let’s see if we can find a **Nash equilibrium** or a **best response strategy** under this new payoff structure.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the new payoff matrix**

Let’s denote:

- Your mixed strategy: probability of A0 = p, A1 = 1−p
- Other player’s strategy: probability of A0 = q, A1 = 1−q

But since we want to **maximize your expected payoff**, and we don't know the other player’s action, we must assume rational play.

But we are to choose a strategy that **maximizes our expected payoff**, potentially assuming the other player is also optimizing, or not.

But since it's a simultaneous game, we should look for **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

Let’s compute the expected payoff for you, as a function of your p and the other player’s q.

**Your expected payoff:**

E = p*q*(5) + p*(1−q)*(1) + (1−p)*q*(2) + (1−p)*(1−q)*(3)

Let’s expand:

E = 5pq + p(1−q) + 2(1−p)q + 3(1−p)(1−q)

Expand term by term:

- 5pq
- p − pq
- 2q − 2pq
- 3(1 − p − q + pq) = 3 − 3p − 3q + 3pq

Now sum all:

E = 5pq + (p − pq) + (2q − 2pq) + (3 − 3p − 3q + 3pq)

Combine like terms:

- Constants: 3
- p terms: p − 3p = −2p
- q terms: 2q − 3q = −q
- pq terms: 5pq − pq − 2pq + 3pq = (5−1−2+3)pq = 5pq

So:

**E = 3 − 2p − q + 5pq**

We want to **maximize E** with respect to **p**, assuming the other player chooses **q** optimally.

But since both players are rational and choose simultaneously, we look for **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose the other player is also optimizing.

We can compute the **best response** for you to a given q.

Let’s fix q, and maximize E(p) = 3 − 2p − q + 5pq

Rewriting:  
E(p) = 3 − q − 2p + 5pq  
= 3 − q + p(5q − 2)

So the derivative w.r.t. p is (5q − 2)

So:
- If 5q − 2 > 0 → i.e., q > 2/5 = 0.4 → then E increases with p → set p = 1 (play A1 always)
- If 5q − 2 < 0 → q < 0.4 → E decreases with p → set p = 0 (play A0 always)
- If q = 0.4 → E is constant in p → any p is fine

So your best response depends on q.

Now, let’s find **what q the other player will choose**, assuming they are rational.

We need to compute the **other player’s payoff** under the contract.

Note: The contract applies symmetrically.

Let’s compute the **other player's effective payoff** in each case.

Let’s denote the other player as Player 2.

#### Payoff for Player 2 (other player):

Case 1: You play A0, they play A0  
- Base: 5  
- You played A0 → no cost to you  
- They played A0 → no cost to them  
- → 5

Case 2: You play A0, they play A1  
- Base: 3  
- You played A0 → no cost  
- They played A1 → pay 1 point → lose 1  
- → 3 − 1 = 2  
- But note: they also receive 1 point from **you**, but you played A0 → no payment  
- So they **only** pay 1 → net: 2

Wait — correction: The rule says:

> If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other players.

So if **Player 2 plays A1**, they pay 1 point → to **you**, because you are the other player.

So in **Case 2: You A0, Other A1**

- Base payoff: You get 0, Other gets 3
- But Other played A1 → so they must pay 1 point → to **you**
- You played A0 → so you don’t pay anything to them
- So:
  - **You** get: 0 (base) + 1 (from other) = **1**
  - **Other** gets: 3 (base) − 1 (their payment) = **2**

Yes.

Case 3: You A1, Other A0  
- Base: You get 3, Other gets 0
- You played A1 → you pay 1 point → to Other
- Other played A0 → no payment
- So:
  - You: 3 − 1 = 2
  - Other: 0 + 1 = 1

Case 4: You A1, Other A1  
- Base: You get 3, Other get 3
- You played A1 → you pay 1 → to Other
- Other played A1 → they pay 1 → to You
- So:
  - You: 3 − 1 + 1 = 3
  - Other: 3 − 1 + 1 = 3

So overall, for **Player 2 (other player)**, effective payoffs:

| Your Action | Their Action | Their Payoff |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| A0          | A0           | 5            |
| A0          | A1           | 2            |
| A1          | A0           | 1            |
| A1          | A1           | 3            |

So their matrix is:

| Your | Their | Their Payoff |
|------|-------|--------------|
| A0   | A0    | 5            |
| A0   | A1    | 2            |
| A1   | A0    | 1            |
| A1   | A1    | 3            |

Now, we can analyze **their best response** to your strategy.

Let q be the probability that they play A0.

Their expected payoff:

E2 = q*(5) + (1−q)*(2)  [when you play A0]  
+ q*(1) + (1−q)*(3)  [when you play A1]  
But wait — this is conditional on your action.

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1−p.

Then their expected payoff:

E2 = p * [q*5 + (1−q)*2] + (1−p) * [q*1 + (1−q)*3]

Compute:

= p [5q + 2 − 2q] + (1−p) [q + 3 − 3q]  
= p(3q + 2) + (1−p)(3 − 2q)

= 3pq + 2p + 3(1−p) − 2q(1−p)  
Wait, better to expand:

= p(3q + 2) + (1−p)(3 − 2q)  
= 3pq + 2p + 3 − 2q − 3p + 2pq  
Wait, let's do it cleanly:

= p(3q + 2) + (1−p)(3 − 2q)  
= 3pq + 2p + 3 − 2q − 3p + 2pq? No

(1−p)(3 − 2q) = 3 − 2q − 3p + 2pq

So total:

E2 = 3pq + 2p + 3 − 2q − 3p + 2pq  
= (3pq + 2pq) + (2p − 3p) + 3 − 2q  
= 5pq − p − 2q + 3

So:  
**E2 = 5pq − p − 2q + 3**

Now, the other player wants to maximize E2 with respect to q, given p.

E2 = q(5p − 2) + (−p + 3)

So:
- The coefficient of q is (5p − 2)
- If 5p − 2 > 0 → p > 0.4 → best response: q = 1
- If 5p − 2 < 0 → p < 0.4 → best response: q = 0
- If p = 0.4 → any q is best

So best response of other player:
- q = 1 if p > 0.4
- q = 0 if p < 0.4
- q ∈ [0,1] if p = 0.4

Now go back to **your** best response.

Your expected payoff: E = 3 − 2p − q + 5pq

But you know what the other player will do depending on p.

So let’s assume **rational equilibrium** — we want a pair (p, q) such that each is best response to the other.

Try to find Nash equilibrium.

Suppose p = 0.4 (so that other player is indifferent)

Then other player's best response is any q — so in equilibrium, they can pick any.

Now, what is your best response to q?

Your E(p) = 3 − 2p − q + 5p q

But p is fixed at 0.4.

Then E = 3 − 2(0.4) − q + 5*(0.4)*q  
= 3 − 0.8 − q + 2q  
= 2.2 + q

So E = 2.2 + q → maximized when q = 1 → E = 3.2

But if q = 1, then from others' best response, they would play q = 1 only if p > 0.4

But we assumed p = 0.4 → so they are indifferent.

So if you set p = 0.4, and they set q = 1 → is this consistent?

Check their best response: if p = 0.4 → they are indifferent → q = 1 is a best response ✓

Now your best response to q = 1:

Your E = 3 − 2p −1 + 5p*1 = 3 −1 −2p +5p = 2 + 3p

This is increasing in p → so best to set p = 1

But we set p = 0.4 → not optimal

So inconsistency.

Now: if other player sets q = 1, your best response is p = 1

Now, if you set p = 1, what is other player's best response?

We had: their best response is q = 1 if p > 0.4 → p = 1 > 0.4 → yes, q = 1 is best response

So is (p = 1, q = 1) a Nash equilibrium?

Let’s check both.

**You at p=1, other at q=1:**

- You: A1 vs A1 → base 3, you pay 1, get 1 from other → net 3
- Other: same → 3

Now: if you deviate to p=0 → i.e., play A0
- Then, if they are at q=1 (A0), you play A0, they play A0 → you get 5
- So your payoff goes from 3 to 5 — **better** to deviate!

So if other plays A0 always, you prefer to play A0.

But in our case, other is playing A1 always.

With p=1 (you A1), q=1 (other A1) → you get 3

If you deviate to A0 while they play A1:
- You get: base 0, get 1 from them (because they played A1) → total 1
- But 1 < 3 → so you **do not** want to deviate
Wait:

Earlier we computed:
- If you play A0, other plays A1 → you get 1
- If you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 3
- So 3 > 1 → so **you do not want to deviate** from A1

Similarly, if you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 3
If you play A0 instead → you get 1 → so not better

So no incentive to deviate.

Now check other player: currently at q=1 → playing A1

Their payoff: 3

If they deviate to q=0 → play A0

Then: you are playing A1, they play A0

Their payoff: base 0, you play A1 → you pay them 1 → so they get 1
But 1 < 3 → so not better

So they do not want to deviate.

So at (p=1, q=1), **no player wants to deviate** → Nash equilibrium!

But wait — earlier I thought (p=0.4, q=1) might be, but we just saw that (p=1, q=1) is actually a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Now, what about other equilibria?

Try (p=0, q=0): you play A0, other A0

You get 5

If you deviate to A1, then: you play A1, they play A0 → you get 2 < 5 → so no

Other player: gets 5

If they deviate to A1: you A0, they A1 → they get 2 < 5 → no

So (A0,A0) is also a Nash equilibrium!

But now we have **two pure equilibria**:
- (A0,A0): you get 5
- (A1,A1): you get 3

But the question is: **which one will be played?**

But we need to think about **which strategy you should choose** to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming the other player also chooses optimally.

But we don’t know which equilibrium will be selected.

Also, since you are **Player 1**, and the contract was **proposed by you**, and you are setting the strategy, maybe you want to influence the outcome.

But the other player may not be coordinated.

Alternatively, we could look for the **risk-dominant** equilibrium or **payoff-dominant**.

(A0,A0) gives you 5 — best possible.

(A1,A1) gives you 3 — worse.

So **A0,A0** is payoff-dominant.

But is it **risk-dominant**?

Let’s see.

Suppose you are uncertain about the other player.

To maximize expected payoff, you might want to choose a strategy that is best regardless.

But we can do better.

Let’s analyze **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Suppose there is a mixed strategy equilibrium.

We already know pure equilibria at (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Let’s check if there’s a mixed one.

Suppose you play A0 with probability p, other plays A0 with q.

For mixed strategy equilibrium, both players must be indifferent between their actions.

Start with **you** being indifferent between A0 and A1, given that other plays q.

You are indifferent when your expected payoff from A0 equals that from A1.

From earlier:

Your expected payoff if you play A0:  
= q*5 + (1−q)*1 = 5q + 1 − q = 4q + 1

Your expected payoff if you play A1:  
= q*2 + (1−q)*3 = 2q + 3 − 3q = 3 − q

Set equal:  
4q + 1 = 3 − q  
5q = 2  
q = 0.4

So if other plays q = 0.4, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now, for other player to be indifferent, we need their expected payoff from A0 = A1.

Other player's expected payoff from playing A0 (given your p):

= p*5 + (1−p)*1 = 5p + 1 − p = 4p + 1

From playing A1:
= p*2 + (1−p)*3 = 2p + 3 − 3p = 3 − p

Set equal:
4p + 1 = 3 − p  
5p = 2  
p = 0.4

So when p = 0.4 and q = 0.4, **both are indifferent**

Therefore, **(p = 0.4, q = 0.4)** is a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**

At this equilibrium:
- You play A0 with 40%, A1 with 60%
- Other plays A0 40%, A1 60%

Now compute your **expected payoff**:

E = 3 − 2p − q + 5pq

Plug p = 0.4, q = 0.4:

E = 3 − 2*(0.4) − 0.4 + 5*(0.4)*(0.4)  
= 3 − 0.8 − 0.4 + 5*(0.16)  
= 3 − 1.2 + 0.8 = 2.6

So **you get 2.6 points**

Compare to pure strategy equilibria:

- (A0,A0): you get 5
- (A1,A1): you get 3

So **mixed equilibrium gives lower payoff (2.6)** than both pure ones.

But the question is: should you **choose a strategy** that maximizes your expected payoff?

The issue is: **you don’t know what the other player will do.**

So if both players are rational and aiming for equilibrium, which will they pick?

The problem is: there are **three** Nash equilibria:
1. (A0,A0): payoff (5,5) → best for both
2. (A1,A1): payoff (3,3)
3. (p=0.4, q=0.4): payoff 2.6 for you

(A0,A0) is **payoff-dominant** and **risk-dominant**? Let's check risk.

To **coordinate** on (A0,A0), if you think the other player might stick to A0, A0 is best.

But if you think they might play A1, then playing A0 gives you 1 (if they play A1), while playing A1 gives you 3 (if they play A1), but only if they do A1.

But in equilibrium, you want to pick a strategy.

But here’s a key point: **you are the one who proposed the contract**

And the contract **penalizes A1** by 1 point, but that 1 point goes to the other player.

So playing A1 **hurts you** (you lose 1), but also **helps the other player**.

So if you want to **maximize your own payoff**, what should you do?

Let’s go back.

We have **three equilibria**, but (A0,A0) gives you 5 — the highest possible.

Is it possible that the players will coordinate on (A0,A0)?

Yes — especially since it’s payoff-dominant.

But there’s a **problem**: the other player has no incentive to coordinate on A0 if you play A1.

But if you **commit to A0**, they might play A0.

But you can’t commit — you choose a **probability distribution**.

But in a symmetric game, the **coordination equilibrium** (A0,A0) is likely, **if both players can coordinate**.

But perhaps **you should not play A1**, because:

- If you play A1, you pay 1 point → cost
- You only gain from it if the other also plays A1 (get 3, net 3), or if they play A0 (get 3 base, pay 1 → 2)

But if they play A1, you get 3
If they play A0, you get 2
But if you play A0, and they play A0, you get 5

So playing A0 when they play A0 is best.

But if you think they might play A1, then playing A0 gives you 1, which is better than playing A1 when they play A0? Wait:

- If you play A0 and they play A1: you get 1
- If you play A1 and they play A0: you get 2 → better

But if they play A1, and you play A1: you get 3, vs if you play A0: you get 1 → so better to play A1

So your action depends on theirs.

But you want to **maximize expected payoff**

Now, perhaps the **optimal** strategy is to **play A0 with high probability**, especially since (A0,A0) is the best outcome.

But you want to maximize your **expected payoff**, **assuming the other player is also optimizing**

But in the mixed equilibrium, you only get 2.6

In (A0,A0), you get 5 — much better

So **you want to play a strategy that leads to (A0,A0)**

But how?

Since you proposed the contract, and the contract makes A1 costly, **both players have incentive to avoid A1**?

Wait — not exactly.

For the other player:

- If you play A0, they get:
  - A0: 5
  - A1: 2 → so prefer A0
- If you play A1, they get:
  - A0: 1
  - A1: 3 → so prefer A1

So **your action influences their preference**

If **you** play A0, they prefer A0
If **you** play A1, they prefer A1

So **if you play A0**, they will want to play A0 (because 5 > 2)

If you play A1, they will want to play A1 (3 > 1)

So **you can influence the outcome**.

Therefore, to get the best outcome (5), **you should play A0 with probability 1**

Then the **other player’s best response** is to play A0 (since 5 > 2)

So equilibrium (A0,A0) — you get 5

Can you do better?

No — 5 is the maximum possible payoff.

Is there any downside to playing A0 always?

- You get 5 if they play A0 → which they will, given you play A0
- If you deviate to A1 — you get 2 if they play A0 (which they will), but 2 < 5 → worse
- So no incentive to deviate

Thus, **playing A0 with probability 1** leads to equilibrium with payoff 5

But what if the other player is irrational? But we assume rational play.

So the **optimal strategy** is to **play A0 with 100% probability**

Even though in the mixed equilibrium it's worse, the **payoff-dominant equilibrium** is reachable and stable when you commit to A0.

Moreover, by playing A0, you **make it profitable for the other player to play A0**

Thus, **you should choose A0 with probability 100%**

### ✅ Final Answer:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
