    "response": "To maximize points in this coordination game, we want to ensure both players choose action A0, which yields the highest joint and individual payoff (5, 5). Without a contract, the game has two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). (A1, A1) is often chosen because it is risk-dominant; each player is guaranteed 3 points regardless of the other's action, whereas A0 risks a payoff of 0.\n\nBy proposing a contract, we can alter the payoffs of the off-diagonal results (A0, A1 and A1, A0) without affecting the outcomes where both players choose the same action (A0, A0 and A1, A1), as the transfers between players cancel out in those cases.\n\nTo make A0 the only rational choice, we need to make it a dominant strategy. Let $C(A0)$ and $C(A1)$ be the contract values. The payoff for Player 1 when playing A0 if Player 2 plays A1 is $0 + C(A0) - C(A1)$. For A0 to be a dominant strategy, this must be greater than the payoff for playing A1 if Player 2 plays A1, which is $3 + C(A1) - C(A1) = 3$. \nThus: $0 + C(A0) - C(A1) > 3 \\implies C(A0) - C(A1) > 3$.\n\nIf we set $C(A0) = 4$ and $C(A1) = 0$, the payoff matrix becomes:\n- (A0, A0): (5, 5)\n- (A0, A1): (4, -1)\n- (A1, A0): (-1, 4)\n- (A1, A1): (3, 3)\n\nIn this scenario, A0 is a dominant strategy for both players ($5 > -1$ and $4 > 3$). This ensures the outcome is (A0, A0), providing 5 points. Any contract values that satisfy $C(A0) - C(A1) > 3$ will achieve this coordination while remaining fair and likely to be approved.\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 4, \"A1\": 0}\n```",

    "response": "To maximize points, we first analyze the base game's payoff matrix (Player 2's payoffs are listed first):\n\n- (A0, A0): (5, 5)\n- (A0, A1): (0, 3) \u2014 P2 chooses A0, P1 chooses A1\n- (A1, A0): (3, 0) \u2014 P2 chooses A1, P1 chooses A0\n- (A1, A1): (3, 3)\n\nIn the base game, both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash equilibria. The outcome (A0, A0) provides the highest total payoff for both players (5 each), but (A1, A1) is a risk-dominant equilibrium.\n\nA contract allows us to introduce additional payments. Given a contract {A0: X, A1: Y}, if Player 2 plays $A_{p2}$ and Player 1 plays $A_{p1}$, the net points for Player 2 will be the base payoff plus $Extra(A_{p2}) - Extra(A_{p1})$. Because the extra payments are drawn from the other player, any scenario where both players choose the same action results in a net exchange of zero, keeping the payoffs at (5, 5) for (A0, A0) and (3, 3) for (A1, A1).\n\nTo maximize total points, we want to ensure the players coordinate on the (A0, A0) outcome. By making A0 a dominant strategy, we eliminate the risk of the (A1, A1) equilibrium. For A0 to be a dominant strategy for both players:\n1. Payoff(A0, A0) > Payoff(A1, A0) $\\implies 5 > 3 + Y - X \\implies X - Y > -2$\n2. Payoff(A0, A1) > Payoff(A1, A1) $\\implies 0 + X - Y > 3 \\implies X - Y > 3$\n\nBy setting $X=4$ and $Y=0$, we satisfy $X - Y > 3$. The modified payoff matrix becomes:\n- (A0, A0): (5, 5)\n- (A0, A1): (4, -1)\n- (A1, A0): (-1, 4)\n- (A1, A1): (3, 3)\n\nIn this scenario, A0 is the strictly dominant strategy for both players, leading them to the (A0, A0) outcome with a payoff of 5 points each. This is the maximum achievable stable payoff in the game, as the sum of points in any other scenario is lower (3 or 6).\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 4, \"A1\": 0}\n```",

    "response": "To design a contract that maximizes the total points received, we need to consider the payoffs of the original game and how we can incentivize both players to adopt certain strategies that lead to the most beneficial outcomes.\n\nThe original payoff matrix is as follows:\n\n|          | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |\n|----------|------------------|------------------|\n| You A0   | (5, 5)           | (0, 3)           |\n| You A1   | (3, 0)           | (3, 3)           |\n\nFrom this, it's clear that the most beneficial mutual outcome is when both players choose A0, resulting in a (5, 5) payoff. However, without coordination, there's a risk that players might choose A1 to avoid the (0, 3) or (3, 0) outcomes. We will use the contract to align both players' incentives towards the mutually beneficial (5, 5) outcome.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Best Outcome**: Both players choosing A0 gives the highest total payoff of 10 points (5 points each).\n\n2. **Understand Potential Divergence**: Without a contract, players might fear the other choosing A1, leading them to also choose A1, resulting in a less efficient (3, 3) payoff.\n\n3. **Design Incentives**: The contract should incentivize both players to choose A0. We aim to penalize for choosing A1 and/or reward for choosing A0 to ensure both players willingly choose A0.\n\n4. **Balance the Payoffs**: Ensure the incentives/penalties are balanced such that the total points distributed in the game do not drastically deviate from the original game's total points possible across both actions.\n\n### Constructing the Contract:\n\n- To incentivize A0, we reward for choosing A0.\n- To disincentivize A1, we penalize for choosing A1.\n\nLet\u2019s propose additional payoffs as follows:\n- A0: +2 points (additional bonus for coordination)\n- A1: -2 points (penalty for deviation)\n\nThis setup makes sure that the total points when both choose A0 are still singly distributed but with additional encouragement to stick to A0.\n\n### JSON Representation:\n\nThe final contract can be represented as a JSON object as required:\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -2}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **A0**: This gives a reward of +2 points if a player chooses A0, further encouraging the high payoff (5, 5) outcome.\n- **A1**: This imposes a penalty of -2 points if a player chooses A1, discouraging the deviation to the (3, 3) outcome.\n\nBy proposing this contract, you ensure that choosing A0 is more attractive for both players, facilitating the optimal payoff configuration.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -2}\n```",

    "response": "Let's break this down step by step, carefully analyzing the game, the payoffs, and how contracts can be used strategically to maximize our expected points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**\n\nWe are in a symmetric game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2), each choosing between A0 and A1.\n\nPayoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):\n\n|          | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| **A0 (P1)** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |\n| **A1 (P1)** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Nash Equilibria (Base Game)**\n\nLet\u2019s find the pure-strategy Nash equilibria.\n\n- (A0, A0): If P1 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 \u2192 no incentive. If P2 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 \u2192 no incentive. \u2192 **NE**\n- (A1, A1): If P1 deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3 \u2192 no incentive. Same for P2. \u2192 **NE**\n- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, could switch to A1 \u2192 gets 3 > 0 \u2192 deviation profitable \u2192 not NE\n- (A1, A0): P2 gets 0, could switch to A1 \u2192 gets 3 > 0 \u2192 deviation profitable \u2192 not NE\n\nSo pure NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)\n\nNow consider mixed strategies.\n\nLet P1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p)  \nLet P2 play A0 with probability q, A1 with (1-q)\n\nFor P1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\n- Expected payoff A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q\n- Expected payoff A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3\nSet equal: 5q = 3 \u2192 q = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nFor P2 to be indifferent:\n- A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p\n- A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3\nSet equal: 5p = 3 \u2192 p = 0.6\n\nSo one mixed-strategy NE: both play A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4\n\nThus, the game has multiple equilibria: two pure and one mixed.\n\nBut importantly, the **(A0, A0)** outcome gives both 5 points \u2192 best for **both** in terms of payoffs.\n\nBut (A1, A1) gives only 3 each \u2192 worse.\n\nSo (A0, A0) is Pareto superior.\n\nBut in equilibrium, rational players may not coordinate on (A0, A0) unless they can commit or trust each other.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Introduce the Contract Mechanism**\n\nNow we can **propose a contract** that adds extra payoffs:\n\n- For each action (A0 or A1), we define a number:\n  - Positive: we get money from the other player (we are paid)\n  - Negative: we pay money to the other player\n  - Zero: no transfer\n\nWe can **propose** a contract. The **other player also proposes** one. Then both of us vote on the contracts (approval voting). The one with **most approvals** wins. In case of a tie, **randomly selected from the tied contracts**.\n\nWe are to **maximize our total points** \u2014 this includes:\n- Base game payoff\n- Contract payoff (if we accept the contract)\n\nBut note: **the contract only takes effect if both accept it.**\n\nSo we can only benefit from the contract **if we accept it AND the other player accepts it.**\n\nWe want to **design a contract that incentivizes the other player to accept it**, especially one that **leads to the outcome we prefer**, ideally (A0, A0), where we get 5.\n\nBut our own action choice is still probabilistic (we choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1). But we can influence the other player\u2019s behavior via the contract.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Strategy for Contracts**\n\nWe need to **design a contract that makes it in the other player\u2019s interest to play A0**, so that we can reach (A0, A0) \u2014 which gives us 5 points.\n\nBut the contract is applied **unilaterally**: we specify the extra payoff for **our own actions**, and the other player specifies theirs.\n\nBut remember: **the contract is only active if both players accept it.**\n\nSo we can design a contract that gives **us incentives** (positive amounts) in certain actions, and/or **penalizes or rewards** the other player (via payments).\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: the **contract defines payments based on the action the player takes** \u2014 so when *I* play A0, I get +X (if contract says A0: +X), and similarly for A1.\n\nImportant: the **contract specifies payments from the \"player's perspective\"**.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify:\n\n> \"A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:\n> - Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).\n> - Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).\"\n\nSo, for **me**, if I play A0 and my contract says A0: +5, I get +5 from the contract (paid by the other player).\n\nSo the total payoff = base payoff + contract payoff.\n\nThe key is: the **other player designs their own contract** \u2014 so they will also want to influence the game outcome in their favor.\n\nWe want to design a contract such that:\n\n1. It **is appealing enough to the other player** that they want to **accept it**.\n2. Once accepted, it **leads to the outcome (A0, A0)** \u2014 or at least increases the probability of it \u2014 so we get high base payoff.\n3. Even if they design their own contract, we need our contract to **win in the approval voting process**.\n\nBut we only get to **propose one contract**. The other player proposes another. Then both of us vote on both.\n\nSo we can **strategically propose a contract that we think will get both of us to accept** \u2014 and that leads to our preferred outcome.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Target Outcome: (A0, A0)**\n\nWe want (A0, A0) because:\n- We get 5 points (best possible)\n- The other player also gets 5 points\n\nSo if we can coordinate on (A0, A0), we both get the best payoff.\n\nBut without cooperation, the other player might play A1 (if they think we are going to play A0), because playing A1 gets them 0 in (A0,A1), which is worse than 5 \u2014 so actually, in (A0,A1) they get 3, which is less than 5. Wait, no:\n\nCheck (A0, A1): we (P1) get 0, other player gets 3.\n\nSo if other player plays A1 when we play A0, they get 3 \u2014 less than 5, so they are worse off.\n\nSo **the other player has no incentive to play A1 when we play A0**, because they get only 3 instead of 5.\n\nBut if *they* play A0, and we play A1, then they get 0 \u2014 worse than 3.\n\nSo actually:\n- If I play A0, they prefer A0 (get 5 vs 3)\n- If I play A1, they prefer A1 (get 3 vs 0)\n\nBut if I play A1 and they play A0 \u2192 they get 0 \u2192 bad. So they'd rather play A1 to get 3.\n\nSo the problem is: **if I play A1, they play A1** (to avoid 0).\n\nBut if I play A0, they play A0 (to avoid 3).\n\nBut I want to **incentivize them to play A0**, because that leads to (A0, A0), which gives me 5.\n\nBut the issue is: **I don\u2019t control their behavior** \u2014 they will choose their action to maximize their payoff, given my action.\n\nSo the only way to get (A0, A0) is if we both want to play A0.\n\nBut if I play A0, they will play A0 \u2014 so (A0,A0) is stable **if I play A0**.\n\nBut if I play A1, they play A1 \u2192 (A1,A1) \u2192 I get 3.\n\nSo if I play A0, I get 5. If I play A1, I get 3. So **I should play A0** \u2014 unless there\u2019s a reason not to.\n\nBut if I play A0, I get 5 \u2014 best.\n\nBut **can I be sure the other player will play A0?**\n\nOnly if they are convinced it\u2019s optimal.\n\nBut as above: if I play A0, their best response is A0 (5 > 3).\n\nSo if I play A0, they play A0 \u2192 I get 5.\n\nBut the problem is: **I don\u2019t know what they will do**.\n\nBut in equilibrium, we can expect them to play A0 **if** I play A0.\n\nBut if I am uncertain, I might randomize.\n\nBut actually, **Pareto efficiency is achieved at (A0,A0)**, and both players have incentive to coordinate on it if they can.\n\nBut contracts can help us **enforce** that.\n\nSo let\u2019s use the contract to **ensure that both players want to play A0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Design a Contract That Makes A0 Dominant**\n\nI want to create a contract such that **no matter what the other player does**, I am better off playing A0.\n\nBut I can't force them to play A0, but I can **reward** myself for playing A0 and **penalize me for playing A1**, if it helps.\n\nBut the contract affects **my own payoff**.\n\nSo I can say: \"If I play A0, I get +5 extra; if I play A1, I pay -3\".\n\nBut the other player sees that.\n\nAlternatively, to **incentivize them** to play A0, I can **reward them** if they play A0.\n\nBut **only if I set up the contract to pay them when they play A0**.\n\nBut I'm proposing **my own** contract.\n\nSo I can say:\n\n| Action | My contract payoff |\n|--------|------------------|\n| A0     | +2               |\n| A1     | 0                |\n\nThen, if I play A0, I get +2 extra \u2014 so my total payoff increases.\n\nBut this doesn't affect the other player directly \u2014 it\u2019s **only my** extra. They don't get anything.\n\nBut they are **not** going to care about my extra payoff unless it makes them better off.\n\nUnless **the contract is structured to benefit them**.\n\nBut wait: **the contract is an agreement: if I play A0, I pay them or they pay me?**\n\nFrom the description:\n\n> \"Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).\"\n\nSo if I set A0: +2 in my contract, that means **I receive +2**, **from the other player**.\n\nSo if I play A0, the other player pays me 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I set A0: -2, I pay the other player 2.\n\nAh! So **the contract has a transfer effect**.\n\nSo if I write A0: +2, A1: 0, then:\n\n- If I play A0: I get +2 **from the other player**\n- If I play A1: no extra transfer\n\nSo this increases my payoff if I play A0.\n\nBut what does that do to the **other player**'s incentives?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the **other player plays A0**, and I play A0 \u2192 I get +2 from them, so I am **indifferent or better**.\n\nBut their own payoff: they get 5 (base) + they pay me 2 \u2192 total 3.\n\nWait: if I play A0, I get +2 from them \u2192 so **they lose 2**.\n\nSimilarly, if I play A0 and they play A1, they get 3 (base) + they pay me 2 \u2192 total 1.\n\nSo they **get less** when I play A0.\n\nBut they might want to **avoid** me playing A0?\n\nNo \u2014 they have their own strategy.\n\nThis is getting complex.\n\nLet\u2019s reframe.\n\nThe contract is **my** proposal. It defines:\n- How much **I** receive or pay based on the **action I take**.\n- And transfers happen **between us**.\n\nSo my contract affects:\n- My total payoff (base + contract)\n- The other player's payoff (opposite of my gain/loss)\n\nBut the **other player** will also design a contract \u2014 so they may try to **penalize** me for playing certain actions.\n\nBut the **winning contract** is the one that **gets most approvals** \u2014 and we both vote.\n\nSo to make our contract **get approved**, we need **both players** to want to accept it.\n\nSo the contract must be **mutually beneficial** \u2014 or at least **not harmful** to each player.\n\nBut we are trying to **maximize our own total points**, so we should design a contract that:\n1. Is acceptable to the other player (so they accept it)\n2. Leads to high probability of (A0, A0)\n3. Maximizes our expected payoff (base + contract)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Key Insight \u2014 Design a Contract That Makes A0 Dominant for Both**\n\nLet\u2019s try to design a contract where:\n- If I play A0, I get +2 from them\n- If I play A1, I pay them 0\n\nSo my contract: {\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThen:\n- If I play A0 \u2192 I get +2 from them \u2192 they lose 2\n- If I play A1 \u2192 no change\n\nSo my total payoff is increased if I play A0.\n\nBut the other player hates it when I play A0 \u2014 they lose 2.\n\nBut they only lose it if I play A0 \u2014 so they might want to **avoid** me playing A0 by playing A1 themselves \u2014 to make me play A1?\n\nBut if they play A1, and I play A0 \u2192 I get 0 base + 2 = 2, they get 3 base - 2 = 1\n\nIf they play A0 and I play A0 \u2192 I get 5 + 2 = 7, they get 5 - 2 = 3\n\nIf I play A1:\n- I get 3 + 0 = 3\n- They get 0 or 3 (depending on their choice)\n\nBut if they play A0 and I play A1: they get 0 base - 0 = 0\n\nIf they play A1 and I play A1: they get 3 - 0 = 3\n\nSo if they play A0, and I play A1, they get 0\nIf they play A1, and I play A1, they get 3\n\nSo they are better off playing A1 when I play A1.\n\nBut they don\u2019t know what I will do.\n\nSo if I play A0, they get 3 (if they play A0) or 1 (if they play A1)\n\nSo they prefer to play A0.\n\nIf I play A1, they get 0 (if they play A0) or 3 (if they play A1) \u2192 so they prefer to play A1.\n\nBut I am incentivized to play A0 (gives me 5 + 2 = 7 vs 3 + 0 = 3)\n\nSo if I play A0, they prefer to play A0 \u2192 so (A0, A0) happens \u2192 I get 7 total.\n\nBut if I play A1, they play A1 \u2192 I get 3 \u2192 worse.\n\nSo I will play A0 \u2192 they play A0 \u2192 I get 7.\n\nBut the **other player gets 3** (5 - 2), which is worse than if they just played A0 in the base game (get 5).\n\nSo they are worse off \u2014 they might **not want to accept this contract**.\n\nIndeed, if they accept it, and they play A0, they get only 3.\n\nBut if they reject it, and we play base game, they could get 5 in (A0,A0), or 3 in (A1,A1), etc.\n\nSo they are worse off under this contract **unless they play A0 and I play A0**.\n\nBut even then, they get only 3.\n\nSo they may **reject the contract** \u2014 which means I don\u2019t get the extra 2.\n\nSo this contract may **not be accepted**.\n\nBut I want it accepted.\n\nSo I must **make it beneficial for the other player as well**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Design a Symmetric Contract That Rewards Coordination**\n\nIdea: make a contract where **both players are rewarded when they both play A0**.\n\nBut only one contract can be chosen.\n\nSo instead, I can propose a contract that **gives each player a bonus when they play A0**, but only if both agree.\n\nBut contracts are **unilateral** \u2014 I set my contract.\n\nBut the contract can include transfers.\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\n{\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -2}\n\nThen:\n- If I play A0: I get +2 from them\n- If I play A1: I pay them 2\n\nSo if I play A0, I gain 2; if I play A1, I lose 2.\n\nSo I **strongly prefer to play A0**.\n\nBut the other player gets:\n- If I play A0 \u2192 they lose 2\n- If I play A1 \u2192 they gain 2\n\nSo they **hate it when I play A0**.\n\nSo they will want to **avoid** me playing A0 \u2014 by playing A0 to make me play A1? No \u2014 if they play A0, and I play A1 \u2192 I pay them 2 \u2192 they gain 2.\n\nBut I am playing A1 \u2014 so I get 3 base - 2 = 1, they get 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nIf they play A1 and I play A1: I get 3 - 2 = 1, they get 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nWait: when I play A1, I pay them 2 \u2192 so they gain 2.\n\nSo if I play A1, they get: base payoff + 2.\n\nSo if they play A1, they get 3 + 2 = 5  \nIf they play A0, they get 0 + 2 = 2\n\nSo they prefer to play A1 if I play A1.\n\nBut I prefer to play A0 (5 + 2 = 7 vs 3 - 2 = 1)\n\nSo I will play A0 \u2014 they will play A0 (since if they play A0, they get 5 - 2 = 3; if they play A1, they get 3 - 2 = 1) \u2192 so they prefer A0.\n\nSo (A0, A0): I get 5 + 2 = 7, they get 5 - 2 = 3\n\nBut they get 3, which is worse than 5.\n\nSo they dislike this.\n\nTo make them accept the contract, I must **give them a benefit**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Best Idea: A Contract That Gives Them a Benefit When They Play A0**\n\nSuppose I propose a contract that says:\n- If I play A0: I get +0 (no gain)\n- If I play A1: I pay them -0 (no cost)\n\nNo incentive. But not helpful.\n\nSuppose:\n- I set A0: 0\n- I set A1: 0\n\nThen no contract effect \u2014 just base game.\n\nNot useful.\n\nSuppose:\n- I set A0: 0\n- I set A1: -5\n\nThen if I play A1, I pay them 5.\n\nBut I would never play A1 \u2014 3 - 5 = -2 < 5\n\nSo I play A0 \u2192 I get 5\n\nBut they get 5 + 0 = 5 (if I play A0)\n\nSo they get same as base.\n\nBut no extra benefit.\n\nBut if they play A0, I play A0 \u2192 they get 5 \u2014 same as base.\n\nBut if I play A1, I pay them 5 \u2014 they get 3 + 5 = 8 \u2014 better.\n\nBut I won't play A1.\n\nSo outcome is (A0,A0) \u2014 they get 5.\n\nBut they get same as base \u2014 so they might accept.\n\nBut is it better for them?\n\nIn base game, they can get 5 in (A0,A0), or 3 in others.\n\nSo they get 5 \u2014 same.\n\nBut I get 5 \u2014 same.\n\nSo no change \u2014 but they gain nothing.\n\nSo they might still accept \u2014 but not compelled.\n\nBut I want **them to prefer to accept**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Breakthrough: Propose a Contract That Makes A0 the Best for Them**\n\nLet me propose:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThen no change. But if they accept, we just play the base game.\n\nThey might accept if they think (A0,A0) is likely.\n\nBut not guaranteed.\n\nCan I make it better for them?\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": 1}\n\nThen if I play A0 or A1, I get +1 from them.\n\nSo whenever I play anything, they pay me 1.\n\nThen:\n- If I play A0: I get 5 + 1 = 6, they get 5 - 1 = 4\n- If I play A1: I get 3 + 1 = 4, they get 3 - 1 = 2\n\nSo they get less in both cases.\n\nSo they will hate this \u2014 they get 4 or 2, instead of 5 or 3.\n\nSo they will not accept.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Final Strategy \u2014 Make Both Players Cooperate by Rewarding A0**\n\nIdea: **Make it so that if they play A0, they get a bonus, but I absorb the cost.**\n\nBut I am designing my contract.\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\n{\"A0\": -1, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThen:\n- If I play A0, I pay them 1\n- If I play A1, I pay them 0\n\nSo I am worse off when I play A0.\n\nBut I want them to play A0.\n\nBut if they play A0, and I play A0, I get 5 - 1 = 4, they get 5 + 1 = 6\n\nIf they play A0, and I play A1, I get 3 - 0 = 3, they get 0 + 1 = 1\n\nIf they play A1, and I play A1, I get 3 - 0 = 3, they get 3 + 0 = 3\n\nSo if they play A0, they get 6 or 1 \u2014 so they prefer to play A0 only if they think I play A0.\n\nBut if I play A0, I get 4; if I play A1, I get 3 \u2014 so I prefer A0.\n\nSo (A0,A0) happens: I get 4, they get 6.\n\nThey get 6 > 5 \u2014 better than base game.\nI get 4 < 5 \u2014 worse than base game.\n\nSo they love this contract \u2014 it gives them 6 in (A0,A0), which is better than 5.\n\nI get 4 < 5 \u2014 worse.\n\nBut I might still want to accept if it leads to (A0,A0), which is better than mixed.\n\nBut in base game, I could get 5 in (A0,A0) \u2014 here I get 4.\n\nSo I am worse off.\n\nBut the contract is for **both to accept** \u2014 and I want to maximize my total.\n\nBut if I propose this, they may accept (because they gain), but I lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nBut what if I do the opposite?\n\nWhat if I propose:\n\n{\"A0\": 4, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThen:\n- If I play A0, I get +4 from them, so I get 5 + 4 = 9\n- If I play A0, they get 5 - 4 = 1\n- If I play A1, I get 3 + 0 = 3, they get 3\n\nSo if (A0,A0): I get 9, they get 1\nIf I play A1: I get 3, they get 3\n\nSo I prefer A0 \u2014 get 9\nThey prefer to play A1 if I play A1 (get 3) or A0 (get 1) \u2014 they want to play A1 if I play A1, A0 if I play A0? But if I play A0, they get 1; if they play A1, they get 3 \u2014 so they prefer A1.\n\nBut if they play A1 and I play A0: they get 3 (base) - 4 = -1\n\nIf they play A0 and I play A0: they get 1\n\nSo better to play A0.\n\nThey get 1 vs -1 \u2014 so they prefer A0.\n\nSo (A0,A0) happens: I get 9, they get 1\n\nThey get only 1, which is worse than 5.\n\nSo they will not accept \u2014 because they are getting less than base.\n\nSo they will reject.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 12: Optimal Contract \u2014 No Cost, But Creates Incentive for Coordination**\n\nFinal idea: **Propose a contract that makes A0 dominant for me, but gives the other player a benefit only when we cooperate.**\n\nBut I can't force anything.\n\nBest compromise: **Propose a contract that gives the other player a bonus if they play A0, and I pay for it by paying them when I play A0? No, that hurts me.**\n\nWait: no.\n\nLet\u2019s think differently.\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThen no contract effect.\n\nBut the other player can propose and get the benefit.\n\nBut I want my contract to win.\n\nSo I need to make my contract **appealing**.\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThen I get +1 if I play A0, 0 if A1.\n\nSo I am more likely to play A0.\n\nBut the other player pays me 1 if I play A0.\n\nSo if we are in (A0,A0): I get 5 + 1 = 6, they get 5 - 1 = 4\n\nIf they play A1 and I play A0: I get 0 + 1 = 1, they get 3 - 1 = 2\n\nThey get 4 or 2, which is less than 5, so they are worse off.\n\nSo they will not accept.\n\nUnless... I make it so that they get a bonus when they play A0.\n\nBut I can't directly give them a bonus unless I pay them when I play A0 \u2014 but that's the opposite.\n\nWait \u2014 no.\n\nThe contract is defined by the player.\n\nWhen I play A0, I pay or receive based on my contract.\n\nIf I want them to get +1 when they play A0, I can't do that in my contract \u2014 unless I set a penalty for them, which I can't.\n\nThe only way to make them better off is if my contract makes them receive money, but that means they get money when **I play an action**.\n\nSo only way is if I receive negative amounts (pay them) when I play something.\n\nBut then I am worse off.\n\nSo the only way to make the other player better off is to **not take any money from them**.\n\nBut then they get the same or less.\n\n unless the contract enables (A0,A0) to happen with higher probability.\n\nBut in base game, (A0,A0) can happen in equilibrium.\n\nThe problem is the other player might not trust.\n\nSo the best idea is to **offer a contract that benefits me and does not hurt the other player, and is credible**.\n\nAfter careful thought, here is a brilliant idea:\n\n### **Propose a contract that has no cost to them, and makes me play A0 for sure, and gives them 5 in (A0,A0), unchanged.**\n\nSo set my contract to: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThen no transfer.\n\nAnd if I play A0, I get 5.\n\nThey get 5.\n\nSo no harm, no gain.\n\nBut they might accept, hoping we both play A0.\n\nBut if we both play A0, we both get 5.\n\nBut in the contract, no change.\n\nBut they have no incentive to accept \u2014 but no reason to reject.\n\nSo acceptance is possible.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nWhat if I make it so that if they play A0, and I play A0, both get extra, but paid by me?\n\nBut I can't.\n\nFinal insight: since both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff, and (A0,A0) is Pareto efficient, and both have incentive to play A0 if the other does, the best contract is to **not have any contract** \u2014 because it's already good.\n\nBut we have to propose one.\n\nAnd we want it to be accepted and lead to (A0,A0).\n\nThe key is: **make the contract such that the other player gets at least as much as in the base game, and I get as much as possible.**\n\nSuppose I propose: {\"A0\": -1, \"A1\":0}\n\nThen if I play A0, I pay them 1.\n\nSo in (A0,A0), I get 5 - 1 = 4, they get 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThey get 6 > 5 \u2014 better.\n\nI get 4 < 5 \u2014 worse.\n\nSo they will accept because they gain.\n\nI get less.\n\nBut if I don't propose this, and we play base game, I might get 5, or 3, or less.\n\nBut if I play A0, they play A0, I get 5.\n\nBut if I propose this contract, and they accept, then in (A0,A0) I get 4.\n\nSo I am worse off.\n\nSo not good.\n\nUnless the contract allows us to coordinate on (A0,A0) more reliably.\n\nBut in base game, we can coordinate.\n\n perhaps the best is to set no transfer.\n\nAfter analysis, the only contract that can be mutually acceptable and doesn't harm them is one that doesn't change payoffs.\n\nSo set:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThen if they accept, we play the base game.\n\nAnd they won't lose anything.\n\nAnd I might get 5.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nFinal solution:\n\n### **Propose: {\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": 2}**\nThen I get +2 for any action.\n\nSo I play A0 for sure (5+2=7 vs 3+2=5).\n\nThey get 3 or 5 minus 2 = 1 or 3.\n\nSo if I play A0, they get 1 if they play A1, 3 if they play A0.\n\nSo they prefer A0 (3 > 1)\n\nSo (A0,A0) -> I get 7, they get 3.\n\nThey get 3, which is less than 5.\n\nSo they will not accept.\n\nUnless I make it so that they get a bonus.\n\n impossible.\n\n after all, the only way to make them accept is to give them a benefit.\n\n best contract: make it so that they get a bonus when they play A0, but I pay the cost.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nTherefore, the only contract that is not harmful to them and might be accepted is one where I give them if they do something.\n\n but I can't.\n\n wait.\n\n what if I offer: {\"A0\": -5, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThen if I play A0, I pay them 5.\n\nIn (A0,A0): I get 5-5=0, they get 5+5=10\n\nThey love it.\n\nI get 0.\n\n not good.\n\n no.\n\n after careful thought, the only viable contract is to have no transfer.\n\nBut let's read the game again.\n\nPerhaps the contract can be used to make A0 the only rational choice.\n\nBut for me, if I set A0: 0, A1: -4, then if I play A1, I pay them 4.\n\nSo I get 3 - 4 = -1, but if I play A0, I get 5.\n\nSo I play A0.\n\nThe other player, if they play A0, and I play A0, they get 5 - 0 = 5.\n\nIf they play A1, they get 3 - 0 = 3.\n\nSo they prefer A0.\n\nSo (A0,A0) happens.\n\nI get 5.\n\nThey get 5.\n\nNo transfer, because my contract has A0: 0, so no payment.\n\nSo if I set {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": -100}\n\nThen I am forced to play A0, because A1 gives me 3 - 100 = -97.\n\nThey get 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1.\n\nSo they play A0.\n\nSo (A0,A0) happens.\n\nI get 5, they get 5.\n\nThe contract has no transfer in this case.\n\nBut if I set A1: -100, then when I play A1, I pay them 100.\n\nBut I never play A1, so no payment.\n\nSo it's as if no transfer.\n\nAnd the other player gets same as base.\n\nSo they have no reason to reject.\n\nAnd I get 5.\n\nAnd this contract is safe.\n\nBut can I get more?\n\nIf I set A0: 1, A1: -100, then if I play A0, I get 5+1=6, they get 5-1=4.\n\nThey get 4 < 5, so they may reject.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, the best is to set A0: 0, A1: any number, say -1, so that I am forced to play A0.\n\nBut to minimize the risk of rejection, better to set A1: 0.\n\nThen my contract is {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}\n\nIt's harmless.\n\nAnd it may be accepted.\n\nAnd we play (A0,A0) with high probability.\n\nBut to ensure, I can set a very high penalty for A1.\n\nBut the risk is that they might not accept if they think it's a trick.\n\nGiven all, the safest and optimal contract is one that does not harm the other player and ensures that I play A0.\n\nSo let's to make it obvious.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n**Propose: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": -1}**\n\n- If I play A1, I pay them 1\n- If I play A0, no transfer\n\nThen:\n- I will play A0 (5 > 3-1=2)\n- If they play A0, I play A0, they get 5\n- If they play A1, and I play A0, they get 3 - 0 = 3\n- So they prefer A0 (5 > 3)\n\nSo (A0,A0) happens.\n\nI get 5, they get 5.\n\nNo transfer, so they are not hurt.\n\nAnd I ensure coordination.\n\nAnd the contract has a -1 for A1, which is a small penalty.\n\nSo it's credible.\n\nAnd they are not worse off.\n\nSo likely to accept.\n\nAnd I get 5.\n\nIf I do nothing, in mixed strategy, I might get less.\n\nSo this is good.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nSuppose I set A0: 1, A1: -10\n\nThen if I play A0, I get +1 from them, so 6\nThey get 4\nThey are worse off.\n\nSo not good.\n\nSo best is to avoid giving them less.\n\nTherefore, the best contract is to have no positive or negative effect, but ensure my action is A0.\n\nSo only set A1: -1, A0: 0.\n\nThen I and they both get 5.\n\nAnd I ensure coordination in (A0,A0).\n\nSo this is optimal.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": -1}",

    "response": "Let's break this down step by step to design a contract that maximizes *your* total expected points, given that:\n\n- You are Player 2.\n- You and the other player (Player 1) simultaneously choose a probability over actions A0 and A1.\n- After that, a random draw determines the actual actions based on those probabilities.\n- Points are awarded based on the payoff matrix.\n- Then, a contract is proposed by both players (you and the other player), and only the one with the most approvals will be implemented (with a tie broken uniformly at random).\n- You can propose a contract: a pair of values (for A0 and A1) that represent additional payments you get (or pay) **if you play that action**.\n- The contract only takes effect if **both players accept** it.\n- Your goal: **maximize your expected total points** (original payoff + contract payoff), *conditioned on the contract being accepted*.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the base game (no contract)\n\nLet\u2019s first understand the base game without contracts.\n\nPayoff for Player 2 (you):\n\n| Your Choice \\ Other's Choice | A0       | A1       |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| A0                            | 5        | 0        |\n| A1                            | 3        | 3        |\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- You play A0 with probability $ p $\n- The other player plays A0 with probability $ q $\n\nThen your expected payoff:\n$$\nE_2 = p \\cdot [q \\cdot 5 + (1 - q) \\cdot 0] + (1 - p) \\cdot [q \\cdot 3 + (1 - q) \\cdot 3]\n= p(5q) + (1 - p)(3)\n= 5pq + 3 - 3p\n$$\n\nWe can analyze best responses later.\n\nBut notice:\n- If the other player plays A0, you prefer A0 (5 > 3).\n- If the other player plays A1, you are indifferent (0 vs 3) \u2014 A1 is better.\n- So your best response is:\n  - A0 if $ q > 0.6 $\n  - A1 if $ q < 0.6 $\n  - Indifferent if $ q = 0.6 $\n\nSimilarly, for Player 1:\n| Their choice \\ Your choice | A0 | A1 |\n|----------------------------|----|----|\n| A0                         | 5  | 3  |\n| A1                         | 0  | 3  |\n\nTheir payoff:\n- If you play A0: best to play A0 (5 > 0)\n- If you play A1: indifferent (3 = 3)\n- So best response: play A0 if $ p > 0 $, and indifferent otherwise.\n\nThis suggests a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.\n\nLet\u2019s find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MNE):\n\n- Let $ p $ = your (Player 2) probability of A0\n- Let $ q $ = other player's (Player 1) probability of A0\n\nFor Player 1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\n- Their expected payoff from A0: $ 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p $\n- From A1: $ 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 $\n- Set equal: $ 5p = 3 \\Rightarrow p = 0.6 $\n\nFor Player 2 to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\n- Your payoff from A0: $ 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q $\n- From A1: $ 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 $\n- Set equal: $ 5q = 3 \\Rightarrow q = 0.6 $\n\nSo **(q = 0.6, p = 0.6)** is the unique mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nAt this equilibrium:\n- Expected payoff for you: plug in $ p = 0.6 $, $ q = 0.6 $\n  $$\n  E_2 = 5(0.6)(0.6) + 3 - 3(0.6) = 1.8 + 3 - 1.8 = 3\n  $$\n  So both players get 3 points on average.\n\nBut is this the best we can do? Can we do better by using a contract?\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the contract\n\nThe contract specifies for each action an **extra payoff** you get (or pay) **if you play that action**.\n\nSo if you propose:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -1}\n```\nThen:\n- If you play A0, you receive +2 (from the contract), and the other player pays you 2 total (so they lose 2).\n- If you play A1, you lose 1 (pay 1), and the other player gains 1.\n\nThe contract is **only active if both players accept**.\n\nYou and the other player each propose a contract. Then, for each contract, count how many players approve it. The one with the **maximum approvals** wins. If there's a tie, it's chosen uniformly at random.\n\nYou want to:\n- Propose a contract that you expect to be accepted (and ideally, that gives you higher expected total payoff).\n- Also, make it likely that **your contract gets accepted** \u2014 so it should be appealing to the other player.\n\nSo we need to design a contract such that:\n1. It is **incentive-compatible**: both players have reason to accept it \u2014 i.e., it makes *each* player **better off** than the status quo (i.e., the Nash equilibrium with no contract).\n2. It should **induce behavior** that is favorable to you.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: you **want** to be able to **coordinate on mutual cooperation** \u2014 particularly on (A0, A0), which gives both 5 points. That\u2019s better than the 3 you get in equilibrium.\n\nBut currently, if one plays A0 and the other A1, you get 0, which is bad.\n\nSo you want to **incentivize both to play A0**.\n\nBut the other player has **no incentive to play A0** unless you play A0 \u2014 but you might not want to play A0 unless they do.\n\nHence, we need a contract that **makes it optimal for both to play A0**.\n\nBut you can't force anything \u2014 you can only propose terms.\n\nSo idea: **Design a contract that rewards A0 and penalizes A1**, but in a way that the other player finds it acceptable.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you propose a contract where:\n- If you play A0, you get +x\n- If you play A1, you get -y\n\nBut **you cannot dictate the payoffs for the other player**. Only *your* payoffs are specified.\n\nSo, the contract is unilateral: you specify your own extra payoffs per action.\n\nHowever, **the other player sees this too** and decides whether to accept it. If they accept, the contract is added to the game.\n\nSo, let\u2019s suppose you propose a contract where:\n- A0: +a (you gain a if you play A0)\n- A1: -b (you lose b if you play A1)\n\nThis makes A0 more attractive to *you*. But the other player might **not** accept it unless it benefits them.\n\nSo for the other player to accept, they must **gain utility (or at least not lose)** from accepting the contract.\n\nBut in this setup, **the contract only specifies your extra payoffs**, not theirs.\n\nWait: **How does the contract affect the other player?**\n\nThe description says:\n> \"a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases: Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).\"\n\nAh! Important: **\u201cdrawn equally from the other player(s)\u201d**\n\nSo if you receive +X when you play A0, that money **comes from the other player(s)** \u2014 so the other player loses X.\n\nSimilarly, if you pay -X (i.e., you receive -X), then that amount goes to the other player(s).\n\nSo the **contract is budget-neutral overall**.\n\nFor example:\n- If you get +5 for playing A0, the other player pays 5 total.\n- If you get -3 for playing A1, the other player gains 3.\n\nSo the **net transfer between you and the other player** is exactly what you specify \u2014 it's **not** that you gain X and the other gains nothing; rather, **one pays the other**.\n\nThus, the contract modifies the payoff matrix by transferring money **from the other player to you** based on how you play.\n\nSo if you play A0 and the contract says +a, then:\n- You gain a\n- The other player loses a\n\nSimilarly, if you play A1 and the contract says -b:\n- You lose b (so net gain = -b)\n- The other player gains b\n\nSo **you can only get money from the other player by playing actions you are incentivized to take**.\n\nNow, you want to **design a contract** such that:\n1. When both players accept it, the **equilibrium outcomes** become favorable to you (especially (A0, A0)).\n2. The contract is **acceptable to the other player** \u2014 so that they have incentive to accept.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Designing a contract that induces (A0, A0)\n\nSuppose you want to **make A0 a dominant strategy for you**, and you want the other player to also want to play A0.\n\nBut: the other player might not like playing A0 unless they get something.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you propose a contract where:\n- A0: +3 (you get +3 if you play A0, so other player loses 3)\n- A1: 0 (you get nothing if you play A1, so no transfer)\n\nThen your payoff structure becomes:\n| Your choice / They choose | A0 | A1 |\n|-----------------------------|----|----|\n| A0                          | 5+3=8 | 0+3=3 |\n| A1                          | 3+0=3 | 3+0=3 |\n\nSo for you: playing A0 is **always better or equal**, because:\n- Against A0: 8 > 3\n- Against A1: 3 = 3\n\nSo A0 dominates A1 for you.\n\nNow, what about the other player?\n\nTheir original payoff: if you play A0, they get 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1 \u2192 so they prefer A0.\n\nBut now, you have a contract that **takes 3 points from them if you play A0**.\n\nSo when *you* play A0, they **lose 3** via contract.\n\nSo their total payoff:\n- If you play A0:\n  - They play A0: 5 (base) - 3 (contract loss) = 2\n  - They play A1: 3 (base) - 3 (contract loss) = 0\n\nSo they still prefer A0, because 2 > 0.\n\nIf you play A1:\n- You get 0 from contract (no loss), so no transfer.\n- So they get:\n  - A0: 5 (base) + 0 = 5\n  - A1: 3 (base) + 0 = 3\n  So still prefer A0.\n\nSo for the other player, **A0 is still best response in every case** (if you play A0, they prefer A0; if you play A1, they still prefer A0).\n\nSo for them, A0 is always best.\n\nNow, you want **both to play A0** \u2014 but currently, you are **incentivized to play A0**, and they are **incentivized to play A0**.\n\nSo in equilibrium, both will play A0.\n\nThen your total payoff:\n- Base: 5\n- Contract: +3 (since you played A0)\n- Total: **8**\n\nThe other player:\n- Base: 5\n- Contract: -3 (loss)\n- Total: **2**\n\nSo you gain **8**, they get **2**.\n\nNow, would they **accept** this contract?\n\nWell, if they **don\u2019t accept**, then the game proceeds without contract \u2014 and in equilibrium, they get 3 (as we computed earlier).\n\nBut here, in the contract version, they get 2, which is **less** than 3.\n\nSo they **would not accept** this contract \u2014 it's worse for them.\n\nSo **you cannot propose a contract that harms the other player** and expect them to accept.\n\nSo you need a contract that makes **them better off** than without the contract.\n\nBut you want to get more than 3.\n\nSo, we need a contract that:\n- Gives **you more than 3** expected payoff\n- Gives **the other player more than 3** expected payoff\n- So they have incentive to approve it\n- And you are still better off\n\nBut wait: you can only **transfer money from them to you** based on your actions.\n\nSo your gains come at their expense.\n\nTherefore, the **only way for both to be better off is if the contract causes a shift in behavior that increases total system payoff** (i.e., moves players to A0 A0), and the **contract redistributes the gains**.\n\nBut in this game, A0-A0 gives 5+5=10 total; while in the equilibrium, both get 3, so total 6.\n\nSo if we can induce A0-A0, we can create **4 extra points of total surplus**.\n\nSo if we can **split that surplus somehow** so that **both get more than 3**, and you get more than 3, that\u2019s good.\n\nBut currently, if you just induce A0-A0 without contract, you get 5, they get 5 \u2014 both better than 3.\n\nBut the problem is: **without a contract, neither has incentive to play A0 if the other plays A1**.\n\nFor example, if you play A0, they prefer to play A0 (5 > 3), but if they play A1, you get 0.\n\nBut they don't know what you'll do.\n\nSo mutual cooperation is not stable.\n\nBut with a **contract that coordinates** the outcome, you can make **A0 A0 the equilibrium**.\n\nBut the contract can only affect payoffs, not directly make them play certain actions.\n\nSo idea:\n- Propose a contract that makes **A0 A0 the unique equilibrium**.\n- But make sure that **both players gain more than in the no-contract equilibrium (3 each)**.\n\nSo suppose you propose a contract where:\n- If you play A0: you get +x\n- If you play A1: you get -y\n\nBut since you are the one proposing, the other player decides whether to accept.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you want to **coordinate on A0 A0**, so both play A0.\n\nThen:\n- Your total payoff: 5 + x (since you played A0)\n- Their total payoff: 5 - x (since you get x, they lose x)\n\nBut only if they accept. If they don\u2019t, both get 3.\n\nSo for them to accept, we need: $ 5 - x > 3 $ \u2192 $ x < 2 $\n\nFor you to benefit: $ 5 + x > 3 $ \u2192 $ x > -2 $ \u2014 easy.\n\nSo if $ x < 2 $, they prefer the contract.\n\nBut wait \u2014 this is only if the outcome is A0 A0.\n\nBut **could they end up playing something else**?\n\nWe need to make sure that **A0 A0 is the equilibrium under the contract**.\n\nSo let\u2019s build this.\n\nSuppose you propose:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: 0\n\nThen:\n- If you play A0: you get +1, so other player loses 1\n- If you play A1: no transfer\n\nNow, your payoff matrix (including contract):\n\n| Your choice / Their choice | A0 | A1 |\n|-----------------------------|----|----|\n| A0                          | 5+1=6 | 0+1=1 |\n| A1                          | 3+0=3 | 3+0=3 |\n\nSo your best response:\n- If they play A0: you prefer A0 (6 > 3)\n- If they play A1: indifferent (1 vs 3) \u2192 A1 is better\n\nSo you prefer A0 if they play A0, but A1 if they play A1.\n\nNow, the other player:\n- If you play A0: they get 5 - 1 = 4 (base 5, contract loss 1)\n- If you play A1: they get 3 - 0 = 3\n\nSo if they play A0: get 4 (if you play A0) or 3 (if you play A1)\nIf they play A1: get 3 (if you play A0) or 3 (if you play A1)\n\nSo their payoff matrix:\n\n| Their choice / Your choice | A0 | A1 |\n|-----------------------------|----|----|\n| A0                          | 4  | 3  |\n| A1                          | 3  | 3  |\n\nSo if you play A0: they prefer A0 (4 > 3)\nIf you play A1: indifferent (3 = 3)\n\nSo their best response:\n- A0 if you play A0\n- A1 if you play A1\n\nNow, can we have a mutual best response?\n\n- If you play A0 \u2192 they best respond with A0 \u2192 then you: 6 > 3 \u2192 still want to play A0\n- If you play A1 \u2192 they best respond with A1 \u2192 you are indifferent (3 vs 3), so you might play A1.\n\nSo **(A0, A0)** is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut **(A1, A1)** is also a Nash equilibrium: both play A1, get 3.\n\nIs (A1, A1) stable?\n\n- If you play A1, they are indifferent between A0 and A1 \u2192 so playing A1 is ok.\n- If they play A1, you are indifferent \u2192 so you might play A1.\n\nSo **both A0-A0 and A1-A1 are equilibria**.\n\nBut in A1-A1:\n- You get 3 (base) + 0 (contract) = 3\n- They get 3 - 0 = 3\n\nWhich is **same as the original equilibrium**.\n\nSo they **could end up in the bad equilibrium**.\n\nBut you want to **coordinate on A0 A0**.\n\nBut without coordination, both equilibria are possible.\n\nSo the contract doesn\u2019t help much unless we **eliminate** the (A1, A1) equilibrium.\n\nHow?\n\nSuppose we make playing A0 more attractive to you **and** make playing A1 worse for you.\n\nBut if you make A1 worse (e.g., by adding penalty), you might make them more willing.\n\nTry: **increase the penalty for A1**.\n\nSuppose you propose:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: -2  (you pay 2 if you play A1)\n\nNow, your payoff matrix:\n\n| Your choice / Their choice | A0 | A1 |\n|-----------------------------|----|----|\n| A0                          | 5+1=6 | 0+1=1 |\n| A1                          | 3-2=1 | 3-2=1 |\n\nSo **every time you play**, you get:\n- If they play A0: 6 if you play A0, 1 if A1 \u2192 prefer A0\n- If they play A1: 1 vs 1 \u2192 indifferent\n\nSo your best response: play A0 if they play A0; indifferent otherwise.\n\nNow, their payoff:\n- If you play A0: they lose 1 \u2192 get 5-1=4 (if they play A0), 3-1=2 (if A1)\n- If you play A1: you lose 2 \u2192 they gain 2 \u2192 get 5+2=7 (if play A0), 3+2=5 (if play A1)\n\nSo their payoff matrix:\n\n| Their choice / Your choice | A0 | A1 |\n|-----------------------------|----|----|\n| A0                          | 4  | 7  |\n| A1                          | 2  | 5  |\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0: they prefer A0 (4 > 2)\n- If you play A1: they prefer A0 (7 > 5)\n\nSo **A0 is dominant strategy** for them.\n\nNow, for you:\n- If they play A0: you prefer A0 (6 > 1)\n- If they play A1: indifferent (1 vs 1)\n\nSo **A0 is best response if they play A0**, and you are indifferent otherwise.\n\nNow, can we have equilibrium?\n\n- Suppose they play A0 \u2192 you best respond with A0 \u2192 then they get 4 (if you play A0), and prefer A0 \u2192 so (A0, A0) is equilibrium.\n\n- Suppose they play A1 \u2192 you are indifferent \u2192 could play A1.\n\n  But if you play A1, they get 7 if they play A0 \u2192 so they prefer to play A0.\n\n  So if they play A1, they get 5 if you play A1, but would prefer to play A0 and get 7 \u2192 so they would deviate.\n\n  So (A1, A1) is **not** equilibrium.\n\n  Similarly, (A1, A0): you play A1, they play A0 \u2192 you get 1, but you could switch to A0 and get 6 \u2192 so you deviate.\n\nSo **only equilibrium is (A0, A0)**.\n\nPerfect!\n\nNow, in this equilibrium:\n- You play A0 \u2192 you get 5 (base) + 1 (contract) = 6\n- They play A0 \u2192 they get 5 (base) - 1 (contract) = 4\n\nCompare to no contract: both get 3.\n\nSo:\n- You get 6 > 3 \u2192 better\n- They get 4 > 3 \u2192 better\n\nSo **both players are better off under this contract**.\n\nTherefore, **they should accept it**.\n\nMoreover, you **get 6**, which is a lot better than 3.\n\nCould you do even better?\n\nTry increasing the A0 bonus.\n\nSuppose you try:\n- A0: +2\n- A1: -2\n\nThen:\n- Your payoffs:\n  - (A0, A0): 5+2=7\n  - (A0, A1): 0+2=2\n  - (A1, A0): 3-2=1\n  - (A1, A1): 3-2=1\n\nSo your best response:\n- If they play A0: 7 vs 1 \u2192 prefer A0\n- If they play A1: 2 vs 1 \u2192 prefer A0\n\nSo **A0 is dominant strategy** for you.\n\nTheir payoffs:\n- If you play A0: lose 2 \u2192 get 5-2=3 (if A0), 3-2=1 (if A1)\n- If you play A1: gain 2 \u2192 get 5+2=7 (if A0), 3+2=5 (if A1)\n\nSo their matrix:\n| Their choice / Your choice | A0 | A1 |\n|-----------------------------|----|----|\n| A0                          | 3  | 7  |\n| A1                          | 1  | 5  |\n\nSo if you play A0: prefer A0 (3 > 1)\nIf you play A1: prefer A0 (7 > 5)\n\nSo **A0 is dominant** for them.\n\nEquilibrium: (A0, A0)\n\nYour payoff: 5 + 2 = 7\nTheir payoff: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nNow: you get 7, they get 3.\n\nBut **they get same as no contract** (3), but **no better**.\n\nSo they are **indifferent** to accepting.\n\nBut do we assume they accept if indifferent?\n\nThe contract is accepted if they **approve**.\n\nProbably, we should assume they will **accept if they are weakly better off**, but perhaps only strictly better.\n\nIn this case, they do not get better \u2014 so they might reject.\n\nBut they get same as without contract.\n\nSo **no incentive to accept**.\n\nTherefore, **they might reject**.\n\nSo to **ensure they accept**, we need them to **strictly benefit**.\n\nSo we need their total payoff > 3.\n\nIn the previous case with +1, -2: they got 4 > 3 \u2192 good.\n\nNow with +2, -2: they get 3 \u2192 not good.\n\nSo **+2 is too much** \u2014 you get more, but they don\u2019t.\n\nCan we try A0: +1.5, A1: -1.5?\n\nBut values must be **integers**.\n\nSo we must choose integers.\n\nTry:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: -1\n\nThen:\n- You: (A0,A0): 6, (A0,A1):1, (A1,A0):2, (A1,A1):2\n- So you prefer A0 if they play A0 (6 vs 2), and if they play A1, you prefer A0 (1 vs 2) \u2192 wait, 1 < 2 \u2192 you prefer A1 if they play A1.\n\nSo not dominant.\n\nTheir payoffs:\n- You play A0: they lose 1 \u2192 get 4 (A0), 2 (A1)\n- You play A1: they gain 1 \u2192 get 6 (A0), 4 (A1)\n\nSo they prefer A0 in all cases \u2192 A0 dominant.\n\nBut you? If they play A1, you get 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) \u2192 you prefer A1.\n\nSo if they play A1, you play A1.\n\nBut if you play A1, they prefer A0 \u2192 so they deviate \u2192 so (A1, A1) possible?\n\nSuppose you play A1 \u2192 they get 6 if they play A0, 4 if A1 \u2192 so best to play A0 \u2192 so you deviate to A0.\n\nSo only (A0, A0) is stable? Let's see.\n\n- If they play A0 \u2192 you get 6 vs 2 \u2192 prefer A0 \u2192 stable\n- If you play A0 \u2192 they get 4 vs 2 \u2192 prefer A0\n- If you play A1 \u2192 they get 6 vs 4 \u2192 prefer A0 \u2192 so you get A1 \u2192 they play A0 \u2192 you get 2 \u2192 but you prefer A0 \u2192 so deviate.\n\nSo **only (A0, A0)** is equilibrium.\n\nNow, payoff:\n- You: 5 + 1 = 6\n- They: 5 - 1 = 4\n\nSame as the +1, -2 case.\n\nBut you get same, and they get same, but this is simpler.\n\nBut earlier with +1, -2, you had a dominance for you.\n\nBut here, you don't dominate \u2014 but equilibrium still (A0, A0).\n\nNow, to maximize your gain.\n\nTry:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: -3 \u2192 but then they get more? Let's check.\n\nTry:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: -2 \u2192 already tried: you get 6, they get 4\n\nTry:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: -1 \u2192 you get 6, they get 4\n\nSame.\n\nCan you get **A0: +2**, **A1: -3**?\n\nBut then you get 7 when you play A0, but -0 when you play A1? No:\n\n- A1: -3 \u2192 you lose 3\n\nThen:\n- You play A0 \u2192 get +2 \u2192 so 5+2=7\n- You play A1 \u2192 get -3 \u2192 so 3-3=0\n\nBut if they play A1, you get: (A0,A1): 0+2=2, (A1,A1): 0\n\nSo if they play A1, you prefer A0 (2 vs 0)\n\nIf they play A0, you prefer A0 (7 vs 0) \u2192 so A0 is dominant.\n\nTheir payoffs:\n- You play A0: they pay 2 \u2192 get 3 (A0), 1 (A1)\n- You play A1: you pay 3 \u2192 they gain 3 \u2192 get 8 (A0), 6 (A1)\n\nSo they prefer A0 when you play A0 (3 > 1), and when you play A1, prefer A0 (8 > 6)\n\nSo A0 dominant.\n\nEquilibrium: (A0, A0)\n\nYou get 5 + 2 = 7\nThey get 5 - 2 = 3\n\nThey get 3 \u2014 **same as no contract** \u2014 so might not approve.\n\nSo we need **them to get more than 3**.\n\nSo maximum you can give them is **3.999**, but since integers, **they must get at least 4**.\n\nSo they must get **5 - x \u2265 4** \u2192 x \u2264 1\n\nSo you can get **at most +1 bonus for A0** to ensure they get 4.\n\nBut also, the **penalty for A1**? You can make it large, but it doesn't affect their payoff directly.\n\nBut if you make A1 penalty large, you might make yourself less willing to play A1 \u2014 but if you have A0: +1, you already prefer A0.\n\nBut in the contract, you want **no possibility of bad outcome**, so you need **A0 to be the only equilibrium**.\n\nWith A0: +1, A1: -2, we had:\n- You: (A0, A0):6, (A0,A1):1, (A1,A0):1, (A1,A1):1\n- So if they play A0: you prefer A0 (6 vs 1)\n- If they play A1: you get 1 vs 1 \u2192 indifferent \u2192 but then you are indifferent, but if you play A1, they get 5+2=7 if they play A0 \u2192 so they deviate \u2192 so you deviate back.\n\nSo only (A0,A0) is equilibrium.\n\nAnd you get 6.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nTry **A0: +0**, **A1: -2**\n\nThen:\n- You: (A0,A0):5, (A0,A1):0, (A1,A0):1, (A1,A1):1\n- If they play A0: you prefer A0 (5>1)\n- If they play A1: you prefer A1 (0 vs 1) \u2192 so you play A1\n- Then they get 5+2=7 if they play A0 \u2192 so they deviate \u2192 then you get 1 \u2192 prefer A0 \u2192 so back to A0.\n\nBut (A1,A1) possible?\n\nIf both play A1: you get 1, they get 3+2=5\n\nBut if you play A0, you get 0, but they play A1 \u2192 you get 0, but if you play A1, you get 1 \u2192 so you prefer A1.\n\nBut they get 5 if A1, but if they play A0, they get 7 \u2192 so they prefer A0 \u2192 so they deviate.\n\nSo equilibrium: A0 A0 \u2192 only.\n\nYour payoff: 5\nTheir payoff: 5 - 0 = 5 \u2192 if you play A0, no transfer.\n\nBut you play A0 \u2192 they lose 0 \u2192 no loss.\n\nSo they get 5.\n\nYou get 5.\n\nBut without contract, you get 3.\n\nSo both get more: 5 > 3.\n\nAnd you get **5**, which is better than 6? No, 5 < 6.\n\nBut earlier with +1, -2 you got **6**.\n\nBut here you get **5**.\n\nSo better to go with +1, -2.\n\nBut in +1, -2:\n- You get 6\n- They get 4\n\nIs there a way to get more than 6?\n\nTry:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: -2 \u2192 you get 6\n\nTry A0: +1, A1: -3 \u2192 you get 6 still (since you play A0), and they get 5 - 1 = 4 still.\n\nBut you lose more if you play A1, but you don't.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nSo **+1 and -2 gives you 6**.\n\nCan you get **+2** and **A1 penalty higher**, but **still make them accept**?\n\nOnly if they get more than 3.\n\nSuppose you set A0: +2, A1: 0\n\nThen they get 5 - 2 = 3 if you play A0 \u2014 same as without.\n\nSo they are indifferent \u2192 might reject.\n\nSo no.\n\nTry A0: +1, A1: -1 \u2192 you get 6, they get 4 \u2192 same as before.\n\nSo **best is to set A0: +1, A1: -2**.\n\nNow, is there a contract where you get more?\n\nWhat if you set A0: +1, A1: -2.\n\nWe already have that.\n\nBut in this case, you get 6.\n\nBut could you set A0: +1, A1: -2, and they accept \u2014 yes, because they get 4 > 3.\n\nAnd you get 6 > 3.\n\nAnd equilibrium is unique (A0, A0).\n\nSo **perfect**.\n\nBut wait: is there a contract where you get **7**?\n\nOnly if you get +2 for A0.\n\nBut then they get 3 \u2192 no incentive to accept.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, **optimal contract**: A0: +1, A1: -2.\n\nBut let me check if this is **stable**.\n\nYou play A0.\n\nThey play A0.\n\nIf they deviate to A1: they get 3 (base) -1 (contract) = 2 < 4 \u2192 worse.\n\nIf you deviate to A1: you get 3 - 2 (negative) = 1 < 6 \u2192 worse.\n\nSo yes, (A0, A0) is unique equilibrium.\n\nAnd both get more than 3.\n\nSo accepted.\n\nCould you set A0: +1, A1: -2, and that\u2019s the best.\n\nBut is there a symmetric one?\n\nNo, you want to maximize your payoff.\n\nAlternatively, could you set A0: +1, A1: -2.\n\nBut what if you set A0: +1, A1: -2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the output, values must be integers.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": -2}\n```\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a contract where you get more by making them **more willing**?\n\nSuppose you set A0: +1, A1: 0 \u2192 you get 6, they get 4 \u2192 same.\n\nBut then if they play A1, you are indifferent between A0 (1) and A1 (3) \u2192 so you prefer A1.\n\nThen they get 5+0=5 if they play A0 \u2192 so deviate.\n\nSo they deviate to A0 \u2192 you get 6 \u2192 prefer A0.\n\nSo still (A0, A0) equilibrium.\n\nBut you get same 6.\n\nBut now no penalty on you for A1 \u2014 so **you might play A1 if they play A1**.\n\nBut they won\u2019t.\n\nBut the outcome is same.\n\nBut with **stronger penalty (A1: -2)**, you are even more committed to A0.\n\nSo better for coordination.\n\nSo **+1, -2 is better**.\n\nTherefore, this is optimal.\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": -2}",
