    "response": "To maximize the total points in this game, we first analyze the original game's structure and the effect of the proposed contract.\n\n1.  **Original Game Analysis**: The game is a zero-sum \"Matching Pennies\" game. Player 1 (you) receives 1 point if both players choose the same action (A0, A0 or A1, A1) and -1 point if they choose different actions. The Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) for this game is for both players to play A0 and A1 with 0.5 probability, leading to an expected value (EV) of 0 for both players.\n\n2.  **Contract Mechanics**: A contract $(x_0, x_1)$ adds $x_0$ points to a player's payoff if they choose A0 and $x_1$ points if they choose A1. These points are \"drawn from the other player,\" meaning it remains a zero-sum game. If the contract is active, the payoff matrix for Player 1 becomes:\n    - (A0, A0): $1 + x_0 - x_0 = 1$\n    - (A0, A1): $-1 + x_0 - x_1$\n    - (A1, A0): $-1 + x_1 - x_0$\n    - (A1, A1): $1 + x_1 - x_1 = 1$\n\n3.  **Expected Value with Contract**: Let $k = x_0 - x_1$. The matrix for Player 1 is:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1+k \\\\ -1-k & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The value of this zero-sum game for Player 1 is $V = \\frac{k^2}{4}$. Since $k^2$ is always non-negative, the value of the game for Player 1 is $V \\ge 0$. Conversely, the value for Player 2 is $V_{P2} = -\\frac{k^2}{4}$, which is $V_{P2} \\le 0$.\n\n4.  **Approval Voting and Activation**: A contract only becomes active if both players approve it. Since $V_{P2} = -\\frac{k^2}{4}$, any contract where $x_0 \\neq x_1$ (i.e., $k \\neq 0$) results in $V_{P2} < 0$. A rational Player 2 will not approve such a contract, as they are better off with the original game's EV of 0.\n\n5.  **Strategy**: If both players are rational, no contract that benefits one player will be approved by the other. However, the game allows for any integer value. Proposing a contract with a small difference (like $x_0=1, x_1=0$) yields a positive EV for you ($V=0.25$) if the other player approves it. Since there is no downside (if they reject it, you simply play the original game), you should propose a contract that gives you a slight advantage while being simple enough that the other player might approve it (or if they are not perfectly rational).\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": 0}\n```",

    "response": "To design a contract for this zero-sum game, we must consider the payoff structure and the rules for contract activation.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Base Game:**\nThe game is a version of \"Matching Pennies,\" a classic zero-sum game. Player 2 (your position) wins points if both players choose the same action (A0-A0 or A1-A1), and Player 1 wins if the actions mismatch (A0-A1 or A1-A0). The Nash Equilibrium (NE) for this game is for both players to play a mixed strategy of $50\\%$ A0 and $50\\%$ A1, resulting in an expected payoff of 0 for both.\n\n**2. Impact of the Contract:**\nA contract in this game is a transfer of points based on the final action taken. If the contract specifies $C(A_0) = X$ and $C(A_1) = Y$, then a player playing $A_i$ receives $X$ points from the other player.\nThe net adjustment to Player 2's payoff for the outcome $(P1: A_i, P2: A_j)$ is $C(A_j) - C(A_i)$.\nSince any points gained by one player are lost by another, the game remains zero-sum regardless of the contract.\n\n**3. Strategic Voting and Acceptance:**\nA contract only becomes active if *all* players accept it. In a zero-sum game, a rational opponent (Player 1) will only approve a contract if it does not lower their expected payoff below 0 (the EV of the base game). Conversely, you should only approve a contract if it does not lower your EV below 0. \n\nBecause any contract that increases your EV necessarily decreases Player 1's EV, no non-neutral contract will be approved by both rational players. A neutral contract is one that does not change the game's balance. One such way to ensure a contract is neutral is to set $C(A_0) = C(A_1)$, which results in a net transfer of zero for every possible outcome ($X - X = 0$).\n\n**4. Final Strategy:**\nProposing a neutral contract like `{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}` is the most logical choice. It has the highest probability of being approved by both players. Any attempt to skew the payoffs in your favor would likely be rejected by Player 1, rendering the contract inactive.\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}",

    "response": "To analyze this situation and design an optimal contract, we need to understand the dynamics and payoffs of the base game and how the contract can influence the behavior of both players to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Base Game Payoffs\n- If both choose A0: Player 1 gets 1, Player 2 gets -1.\n- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets -1, Player 2 gets 1.\n- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets -1, Player 2 gets 1.\n- If both choose A1: Player 1 gets 1, Player 2 gets -1.\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective is to maximize Player 1's total points. However, designing a well-balanced contract is crucial to ensure the other player also finds it acceptable. Ideally, we want to influence the other player's choices to align with our strategy.\n\n### Contract Proposal Strategy\n1. **Identify desired outcomes**: Since the game is symmetric and choosing similar actions leads to positive payoffs for Player 1 and negative for the other player, let's aim for outcomes that lead to (A0, A0) or (A1, A1).\n   \n2. **Incentivize choices**: We can use the contract to add positive payoffs for actions that align with this strategy and negative payoffs for actions that lead to undesirable outcomes.\n   \n3. **Balancing**: The contract must be attractive enough for the other player to accept. This means we need to ensure it doesn't overly disadvantage the other player.\n\n### Design a Contract Proposal\nGiven the objective and the need to incentivize actions favorable for Player 1, the contract can be designed to:\n- Reward mutually beneficial actions like (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).\n- Penalize mismatched choices like (A0, A1) and (A1, A0).\n\nHere's one way to structure the contract:\n\n- **A0**: +2 points (Promote mutual selection of A0).\n- **A1**: +2 points (Promote mutual selection of A1).\n\nThe additional points would be drawn equally from the opposing player. This setup should encourage both players to opt for one of the equilibria (A0, A0) or (A1, A1), since both actions have the same additional payoff and yield balanced gains for both players.\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": 2}\n```\n\nThis simple yet effective contract ensures that neither player is heavily penalized in any situation, making it more likely to be acceptable to both while promoting the desired behavior to increase Player 1's total points.",

    "response": "In this game, the goal is to maximize your total points, taking into account both the base game payoffs and the additional payoffs from the contract. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understand Base Game Payoffs**:\n    - If both choose A0: You get 1 point, the other player gets -1 point.\n    - If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get -1 point, the other player gets 1 point.\n    - If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get -1 point, the other player gets 1 point.\n    - If both choose A1: You get 1 point, the other player gets -1 point.\n\n2. **Identify Key Incentives**:\n    - As Player 2, you want to maximize your points.\n    - It seems that in this game, symmetrical outcomes (both players picking the same action) give you a positive point.\n\n3. **Strategic Contract Design**:\n    - You want to propose a contract that incentivizes both players to pick the same action, likely A0 or A1.\n    - Given the player's rationality, they will choose actions that maximize their utility, considering both the base game payoffs and the contract.\n\n4. **Balancing the Contract**:\n    - To make both players more likely to pick the same action and ensure both agree to the contract, it should not skew benefits immensely towards any single player but ought to subtly push behavior that leads to a symmetric outcome.\n    - Given that both A0 and A1 lead to the same net payoff structure for you (1 or -1), you can set an equal incentive/motivation factor for A0 and A1 that enable you to receive positive points regardless of the other player's choice.\n\n### Contract Structure\n\nConsidering all the above, a balanced contract can indirectly steer towards the desired symmetrical moves. Here is how we could set it up:\n\n- Assign additional positive payoffs to A0 and A1 to balance for mutual acceptance.\n- Assign higher negative incentives to the cross-outcomes to dissuade the misalignment in choices.\n\n### Final Contract Proposal\n\nBased on the analysis, you might want a contract where:\n\n- Both A0 and A1 get symmetrical additional payoff benefits.\n- Make the non-cooperative attempts (you pick A0 while the other picks A1, and vice versa) slightly penalized.\n\nThus, the contract looks like below:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": 1}\n```\n\nThis contract incentivizes the player to choose with consideration of cooperative outcomes potentially increasing positive payoff and subtly nudges towards symmetrical choices based on rationality that both choices provide additional equal value whether they choose A0/A1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis contract design approach ensures that both players are equally driven to aim for cooperative actions in the game setup adding a fair incentive promoting symmetric outcomes maximizing your total points. Also, it should get approval easily being fairly balanced promoting equal choice benefits.\n\n\nFinal JSON output:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": 1}\n```",

Designing a contract that you want to be accepted.\n2. Influencing the other player to accept it.\n3. Ensuring that the **winning contract** (the one that gets approved) maximizes your expected payoff.\n\nBut you **don\u2019t know** what contract the other player will propose.\n\nSo you need to think strategically: What kind of contract will be appealing to the other player, and how can you design a contract that:\n- Is likely to be approved by both,\n- Encourages coordination,\n- Gives you a better expected payoff than the base 0?\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Consider possible contract designs\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you propose a contract:\n- A0: +x\n- A1: +y\n\nMeaning: if you play A0, you get x extra points (paid by the other player); if you play A1, you get y extra.\n\nBut this affects **your total payoff** from the game. However, the contract only applies **if accepted**.\n\nSo your total payoff = base payoff + contract payoff\n\nSo, for example:\n- If you play A0, and the other plays A0: base = +1, contract = +x \u2192 total = 1 + x\n- If you play A0, and the other plays A1: base = -1, contract = +x \u2192 total = -1 + x\n\nSimilarly for A1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Can we use the contract to promote **coordination**?\n\nThe fundamental issue in the base game: **players are incentivized to deviate** because the payoffs are anti-symmetric.\n\nBut if we can **make the two players want to coordinate**, then we could increase both of their **expected payoffs** \u2014 which would make the contract more desirable.\n\nWait: but the game has **no positive-sum coordination** in the base payoffs \u2014 coordination gives +1 to you and -1 to the other.\n\nSo if you coordinate and both play A0 or both play A1, **you gain +1**, but the other player **loses 1**.\n\nSo in pure base payoffs, **you gain from coordination**, but the **other player hates it**.\n\nTherefore, the **other player has no incentive to coordinate** \u2014 unless you compensate them.\n\n\u2192 So **if we can design a contract that makes coordination beneficial for both**, the contract becomes attractive.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Try to design a contract that **makes both players want to coordinate**\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you propose:\n- A0: +2\n- A1: +2\n\nThis means: no matter what you play, you get +2 extra.\n\nBut now you\u2019re **subsidizing both actions**.\n\nBut you\u2019re paying **2 points** to yourself from the other player \u2014 so the other player **loses 2** no matter what.\n\nSo if the other player plays A0, you get +2 extra \u2014 but they lose 2 (paid by you).\n\nSo **you are paying 2 points** to yourself **regardless of action**.\n\nSo you are **reducing your own expected payoff** unless coordination happens.\n\nWait \u2014 unless we **tie the bonus to coordination**, and make the **other player gain** when you coordinate.\n\nBut contracts are set **from your perspective**. You cannot force them to gain \u2014 you can only offer yourself a bonus.\n\nThe **other player** will only accept the contract if:\n- They **benefit overall**, or at least don\u2019t lose in expectation\n\nBut **you control the contract**, and the other player decides whether to accept.\n\nSo to get the contract accepted, you need to **make it attractive for the other player**.\n\nBut the other player is **also intelligent** \u2014 they will reason about your proposal and what it does.\n\nSuppose you propose:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 0 \u2192 no extra payoffs\n\nThis contract is neutral. But both players might accept it, but so might others. However, if both players propose this, it might win.\n\nBut that gives you **same as base game** (expected 0).\n\nCan you do better?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you propose:\n- A0: +10\n- A1: -10\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0, you get +10\n- If you play A1, you **pay 10**\n\nBut this makes you **very unlikely** to play A1 \u2014 you will **only** play A0.\n\nBut the **other player** might see this as risky: if you play A0 only, and they play A0 \u2192 they get -1 (base) + extra (which depends on what they get from your contract)\n\nWait \u2014 **your contract only affects your payoffs**.\n\nIf you propose a contract, it only affects **your** extra payoff for each action. The **other player\u2019s** extra payoff is **zero** unless they have their own contract.\n\nBut the contract is **shared** \u2014 if both accept, the payments go from one to the other.\n\nSo when you get +10 on A0, the other player **loses 10** (because money is drawn equally from the other player(s)).\n\nBut \u2014 the **other player has their own contract proposal**, which might say: \"if I play A0, I get +5 from you\", meaning you pay them 5 when they play A0.\n\nBut only one contract can be active.\n\nSo the **contract in effect** is the **one that wins the approval vote**.\n\nSo if you propose:\n- A0: +10\n- A1: -10\n\nThen:\n- If the contract is accepted, and you play A0: you gain +10 from contract\n- But the other player loses 10 from the contract (because it's drawn from them)\n\nSo the **other player is worse off** if you play A0, and even worse if they play A0 (since base is -1, and now they pay 10) \u2192 total -11\n\nBut if they play A1: base = +1, but contract cost = -10 \u2192 payoff = -9\n\nWait \u2014 no: the contract is **only paid based on your action**.\n\nYes: if **you** play A0, then the other player **pays 10** \u2192 they lose 10.\n\nIf you play A1, you **pay 10** \u2192 you lose 10.\n\nSo the other player **only loses 10 if you play A0**.\n\nBut they want to avoid that.\n\nSo they would prefer you play A1, but if you play A1, they get +1 (base), but you pay 10 \u2192 they gain 1 - 10? No:\n\nWait: **How do the payments work?**\n\n> \"a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:\n> * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).\"\n\nSo, if **you** play A0 under this contract, and the contract is active, you get +10 \u2192 that comes from the other player.\n\nSo other player **pays 10**.\n\nSo your **total payoff** = base payoff + 10 (if you play A0)\n\nOther player's total payoff = base payoff - 10 (if you play A0)\n\nSimilarly:\n- If you play A1: you pay 10 \u2192 you lose 10\n- Other player: if you play A1, they gain 10 (from you)\n\nSo for the other player:\n- If you play A0: they lose 10\n- If you play A1: they gain 10\n\nSo they **want you to play A1**.\n\nBut you want to **play A0** (because you gain 10), and **avoid playing A1** (lose 10).\n\nSo a **conflict of interest** \u2014 you want to play A0, other wants you to play A1.\n\nSo neither wants to coordinate.\n\nYou get +10 if you play A0, but then they lose 10, so they are very dissatisfied.\n\nThey will likely **reject the contract** because they are expected to lose 10 even if they coordinate.\n\nSo this contract is **very unlikely to be accepted**.\n\nSo this design is **bad**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Key insight: To get the other player to accept, you must give them an **incentive to want the contract**.\n\nBut they only get **payoff from the contract if they play actions that make you pay them**.\n\nSince the contract only adds **extra payoffs based on your actions**, not theirs, **the other player only benefits when you play actions that require you to pay them**.\n\nSo if **you are going to play A1**, and you propose A1: -10 (so you pay 10), then the other player gains 10.\n\nBut **they don\u2019t know** what you will do.\n\nSo if they believe you will play A1, they gain 10.\n\nBut if you play A0, they lose 10.\n\nSo for them to accept the contract, they need to believe you will play A1.\n\nBut you don\u2019t want to play A1 \u2014 it costs you 10.\n\nSo **there\u2019s a problem**: you can't commit to anything.\n\nUnless... you **tie your action to the contract**.\n\nBut you can\u2019t \u2014 you must choose a probability distribution.\n\nBut you can **signal** via the contract.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Better idea: Design a contract that **makes coordination symmetric and beneficial**\n\nSuppose you propose:\n\n- A0: +1\n- A1: +1\n\nSo if you play A0 or A1, you get +1 extra.\n\nSo you are **subsidizing both actions equally**.\n\nBut **where does that +1 come from?** Drawn from the other player.\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0 \u2192 other player loses 1\n- If you play A1 \u2192 other player loses 1\n\nSo **in all cases, the other player loses 1**, no matter what.\n\nThat is **bad** for them. They would only accept if they get something in return.\n\nBut **they get nothing positive from this contract** unless they play a way that causes you to pay.\n\nBut **you pay regardless**.\n\nSo the other player **always loses 1** under this contract.\n\nSo they will **reject it** \u2014 unless they get compensation.\n\nSo this contract is **not acceptable**.\n\nSo **any contract where you gain** (positive value) **means the other player loses**, unless you have negative.\n\nOnly if you have **negative values**, you are paying \u2014 so the other player gets money.\n\nSo to **make the other player want to accept**, you need to **let them gain** under the contract.\n\nBut the only way they gain is if:\n- You play an action where your contract value is **negative** \u2192 you pay \u2192 they receive.\n\nBut they don\u2019t know what action you\u2019ll play.\n\nSo they might accept if they believe you're likely to play a high-cost action.\n\nBut you don\u2019t want to play that.\n\nSo there\u2019s a **conflict**.\n\nBut what if you **make the contract symmetric**?\n\nSuppose you propose:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 0\n\nThen no extra payoffs.\n\nThen both players are indifferent \u2014 but it\u2019s safe.\n\nBut you get expected 0, same as base.\n\nCan you do better?\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: What if you **propose a contract that rewards coordination**?\n\nBut contracts are defined on your action, not jointly.\n\nBut suppose you propose:\n- A0: +2\n- A1: +2\n\nThen you always gain +2, but the other player always loses +2.\n\nNo gain for them \u2014 they reject.\n\nSuppose you propose:\n- A0: -2\n- A1: -2\n\nThen you always pay 2 \u2014 bad for you.\n\nBut other player always gains 2 \u2014 so they love it.\n\nBut you are worse off.\n\nSo they will accept \u2014 but you are worse off.\n\nSo not helpful for you.\n\n---\n\nWait \u2014 **what if you propose a contract that is symmetric in impact but only applies when actions match?**\n\nBut you can\u2019t \u2014 the contract is only defined per action, not joint.\n\nSo you can\u2019t make the extra payoff depend on what the other player plays.\n\nSo you\u2019re limited.\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Try to **make the contract mutually beneficial**\n\nIdea: suppose you propose:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: -1\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0: you get +1 (other player loses 1)\n- If you play A1: you lose 1 (other player gains 1)\n\nNow, suppose we **coordinate**.\n\nSuppose both players are going to **play A0**.\n\nThen:\n- Base payoff: you get +1\n- Contract: you get +1 \u2192 total: +2\n- Other player: base -1, contract -1 \u2192 total: -2\n\nSo you gain, other loses.\n\nBut if both play A1:\n- Base: you get +1\n- Contract: you play A1 \u2192 lose 1 \u2192 total 0\n- Other: base -1, contract +1 \u2192 total 0\n\nSo in this case, you get 0, other gets 0.\n\nWait \u2014 so in A1 coordination, you get 0, instead of +1.\n\nBut in A0 coordination, you get +2, other gets -2.\n\nSo you want to coordinate on A0.\n\nBut the other player gets -2 in A0 coordination \u2014 worse than base (-1).\n\nSo they prefer not to coordinate.\n\nSo they will likely reject.\n\nBut suppose you **switch the contract**.\n\nTry:\n- A0: -1\n- A1: +1\n\nThen:\n- If you play A0: you pay 1 \u2192 other gains 1\n- If you play A1: you gain 1 \u2192 other loses 1\n\nNow, if you coordinate on A0:\n- You: base +1, contract -1 \u2192 total 0\n- Other: base -1, contract +1 \u2192 total 0\n\nIf you coordinate on A1:\n- You: base +1, contract +1 \u2192 total 2\n- Other: base -1, contract -1 \u2192 total -2\n\nSo again, you want to coordinate on A1 \u2014 you get higher payoff.\n\nBut the other player gets -2 in A1 coordination, worse.\n\nSo they won\u2019t want to coordinate.\n\nSo same issue.\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Can we make a contract where **both players benefit when they coordinate**?\n\nIn the base game, **coordinating is good for you, bad for the other**.\n\nSo to make it good for the other, you need to **compensate them** when you coordinate.\n\nBut you can\u2019t do that directly \u2014 the contract is on your actions.\n\nBut suppose you **design a contract that rewards you for playing the same action as the other**, but how?\n\nNo.\n\nBut here\u2019s a clever idea:\n\nSuppose you **don\u2019t make the contract depend on your action, but make it symmetric** so that you and the other player have **aligned incentives**.\n\nBut the contract is **only from your perspective**.\n\nBut the other player sees: \"if I play X, does it cause you to pay me?\"\n\nNo \u2014 your contract only says what you get.\n\nSo for the other player to get positive payoff, you must play an action with **negative value in your contract**.\n\nSo they only gain when **you play a negative-value action**.\n\nSo to **make coordination good for both**, you need that **when you both play A0**, you both gain, and when you both play A1, both gain.\n\nBut that\u2019s hard.\n\nSuppose you set:\n- A0: +0\n- A1: +0\n\nThen no extra \u2014 safe.\n\nBut expected payoff 0.\n\nBut suppose you propose:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: +1\n\nThen you gain 1 in all cases, but other player loses 1.\n\nSo you get 1 more, other loses 1.\n\nBut total sum: +1 -1 = 0 \u2014 same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nBut if you could make it so that when you coordinate, both gain, and when you don\u2019t, both lose, that would be good.\n\nBut you can't.\n\n---\n\n### Step 12: Breakthrough \u2014 use the contract to **create a new game**\n\nSuppose you propose:\n- A0: **+2**\n- A1: **+2**\n\nYou pay 2 to yourself no matter what.\n\nBut this means the other player loses 2 no matter what.\n\nSo their total expected payoff is reduced by 2.\n\nThey will never accept.\n\nSo bad.\n\nAlternatively, what if you propose:\n- A0: **-2**\n- A1: **-2**\n\nThen you lose 2, other gains 2.\n\nThey will accept, but you lose 2.\n\nBad.\n\nNow, suppose you propose:\n- A0: **-1**\n- A1: **+1**\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0: you lose 1, they gain 1\n- If you play A1: you gain 1, they lose 1\n\nLet\u2019s compute expected payoffs if the other player also plays optimally.\n\nBut you want them to accept.\n\nThey will accept if they expect to benefit.\n\nSuppose they believe you will play A1 with high probability.\n\nThen they expect: you playing A1 \u2192 they lose 1\n\nSo they lose 1 in expectation.\n\nBut if they play A0: base payoff = ? If you play A1, they get +1 (base) and contract: you play A1 \u2192 they lose 1 \u2192 net 0\n\nIf you play A0, they get -1 (base), and contract: you play A0 \u2192 they gain 1 \u2192 net 0\n\nSo regardless of your action, they get 0 from the contract and base?\n\nWait:\n- If you play A0: they get base -1, contract +1 \u2192 total 0\n- If you play A1: they get base +1, contract -1 \u2192 total 0\n\nSo their total payoff is 0 **regardless of your action**.\n\nBut in the base game, expected payoff was 0.\n\nSo they are **indifferent**.\n\nBut you: \n- If you play A0: base = 2q -1 (q = other player's p(A0))\n  + contract = -1 \u2192 total = 2q -2\n- If you play A1: base = 1 - 2q\n  + contract = +1 \u2192 total = 2 - 2q\n\nSet equal: 2q -2 = 2 - 2q \u2192 4q = 4 \u2192 q = 1\n\nSo you would want to play A0 with probability 1.\n\nBut then other player gets: if you play A0, they get 0\n\nBut if you play A0, their base is -1, contract +1 \u2192 0\n\nBut if they play A0, and you play A0, they get 0\n\nBut if they play A1, and you play A0, they get: base +1 (because you played A0), contract +1 (you played A0) \u2192 total +2\n\nLet\u2019s compute carefully.\n\nOther player's total payoff:\n- If you play A0: gain 1 from contract\n- If you play A1: lose 1 from contract\n\nBut base payoff:\n- If they play A0 and you play A0: base = -1\n- If they play A0 and you play A1: base = +1\n- If they play A1 and you play A0: base = +1\n- If they play A1 and you play A1: base = -1\n\nSo let's compute other player's total payoff if you play A0 (which they believe happens with high probability):\n\n- They play A0: base -1 + contract +1 = 0\n- They play A1: base +1 + contract +1 = +2\n\nSo they **prefer to play A1** if you play A0.\n\nBut you are playing A0 (because you want to avoid the +1 cost).\n\nSo they get +2 if they play A1.\n\nBut if you play A1, they get:\n- A0: base -1 + contract -1 = -2\n- A1: base -1 + contract -1 = -2\n\nSo if you play A1, they lose 2.\n\nSo if they believe you play A0, they play A1 \u2192 get +2\n\nIf they believe you play A1, they play A1 \u2192 get -2\n\nSo they will want to play A1 only if you play A0.\n\nBut you want to play A0.\n\nSo if you commit to A0, they play A1 \u2192 you play A0, they play A1 \u2192 different actions \u2192 your base payoff: -1, contract: -1 \u2192 total -2\n\nBut if you could coordinate on A0, you get +1 (base) -1 (contract) = 0\n\nWorse.\n\nSo this is not working.\n\n---\n\n### Step 13: New idea \u2014 use the contract to **create a coordination game where both benefit from aligning actions**\n\nLet\u2019s try this:\n\nPropose:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: +1\n\nThen you gain 1, other loses 1, no matter what.\n\nBut then the other player will lose in expectation.\n\nSo they won\u2019t accept.\n\nBut suppose you propose:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 0\n\nThen no change.\n\nBut here's the key: **you want to increase your expected payoff above 0**.\n\nThe only way is to **make them want to play the same action as you**, and **get paid when they do**.\n\nBut you can't.\n\nUnless you **make a contract that is better if you coordinate**.\n\nBut you can't.\n\n---\n\n### Step 14: Perhaps the best you can do is to **design a contract that is neutral and always accepted**\n\nTry:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 0\n\nThen:\n- No extra payoffs\n- Both players are indifferent\n- So they will likely accept it, especially if other proposals are risky\n- Then the game reduces to base game: expected 0\n\nBut is there a way to do better?\n\nWait \u2014 what if you propose:\n- A0: 1\n- A1: 0\n\nThen:\n- If you play A0: you gain 1\n- If you play A1: you gain 0\n\nBut other player loses 1 if you play A0, gains 0 if you play A1.\n\nSo other player wants you to play A1.\n\nBut you want to play A0.\n\nSo conflict.\n\nBut if the other player believes you will play A0, they lose 1.\n\nIf they believe you will play A1, they gain 0.\n\nSo they prefer you to play A1.\n\nBut you don't want to.\n\nSo you might play A1 with high probability.\n\nThen you get 0 from contract, base varies.\n\nBut if you both play A1, you get +1 base + 0 = +1\nIf you play A0, you get -1 +1 = 0\n\nSo you might prefer A1.\n\nBut the other player, if you play A1, gets +1 base, 0 contract, so +1\n\nIf you play A0, they get -1 base, -1 contract, so -2\n\nSo they prefer you to play A1.\n\nSo if you both play A1, you both get +1.\n\nBut in the base game, you only get +1 if you coordinate.\n\nBut with this contract, you get +1, they get +1.\n\nWait \u2014 no:\n- If you play A1: you get base +1, contract +0 \u2192 total +1\n- They play A1: base -1, contract +0 \u2192 total -1\n\nSo you get +1, they get -1.\n\nSame as before.\n\nThe contract doesn't change.\n\n only if you play A0 do you get the +1 extra.\n\nBut if you play A0, they lose 1.\n\nSo they dislike.\n\nBut they gain only if you play A1.\n\nBut they already get -1 in that case.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nSo for the other player, their expected payoff depends on your action.\n\nBut if you play A1 with high probability, they will get -1 on average.\n\nIf you play A0, they get -2.\n\nSo they prefer you to play A1, but they still get -1.\n\nSo they are not better off.\n\nSo they will likely reject the contract.\n\nUnless you make it so that when you play A1, they get a bonus.\n\nBut you can't.\n\n---\n\n### Final Insight: The only way to make the other player accept is to give them a net benefit *in expectation*.\n\nBut the only way they benefit is if you play an action with negative value in your contract.\n\nSo suppose you propose:\n- A0: -5\n- A1: +5\n\nThen:\n- If you play A0: you lose 5, they gain 5\n- If you play A1: you gain 5, they lose 5\n\nNow, they will only accept if they believe you will play A0.\n\nBut you will only play A0 if it gives you better payoff.\n\nYour payoffs:\n- A0: base (2q-1) -5\n- A1: base (1-2q) +5\n\nSet equal: 2q-1 -5 = 1-2q +5 \u2192 2q -6 = 6 -2q \u2192 4q = 12 \u2192 q = 3\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo you will always prefer A1.\n\nSo you play A1 with probability 1.\n\nThen they lose 5.\n\nSo they get -1 (base) -5 = -6\n\nWorse.\n\nSo they will reject.\n\nBut if you play A0, they get +5, which is good.\n\nSo they want you to play A0.\n\nBut you don't want to.\n\nSo again, conflict.\n\n---\n\n### The solution: make the contract such that **both players benefit from coordination**, and the other player is happy to accept.\n\nThe only way is to **not take from them when you coordinate**.\n\nBut in coordination, you gain, they lose.\n\nThe only way to make it fair is to **offset**.\n\nBut you can't.\n\n unless you have a contract based on joint action.\n\nBut you can't.\n\n### Breakthrough idea: propose a contract that is identical for both actions and zero.\n\nBut that gives you 0.\n\nBut perhaps you can propose:\n- A0: 1\n- A1: 1\n\nThen you get +1, other player loses 1.\n\nBut if you can **convinced the other player** that you will play A0 with probability 0, or something.\n\nBut you can't control.\n\n wait.\n\n### Final solution: propose a contract that is **neutral and safe**.\n\nBecause any contract that gives you a bonus forces the other player to lose, so they will reject.\n\nAny contract that lets them gain requires you to lose.\n\nSo the only contract that has a chance of being accepted by both is the one where **you gain nothing, they gain nothing**.\n\nSo:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 0\n\nThis is risk-free.\n\nThe other player gets no benefit from it, but no cost.\n\nThey will accept it, because it's neutral.\n\nYou get expected 0.\n\nCan you do better?\n\nSuppose you propose:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 1\n\nThen:\n- If you play A0: no extra\n- If you play A1: you get +1\n\nBut other player loses 1 if you play A1.\n\nSo they are not better off.\n\nIf they believe you will play A1, they lose 1.\n\nBut in the base game, they expected 0.\n\nSo if they believe you play A1 with >0 probability, they lose in expectation.\n\nSo they will likely reject.\n\nSimilarly for any positive number.\n\nSo the only contract that has a chance of being accepted by both is the **zero contract**.\n\nBecause it's neutral.\n\nAnd if the other player proposes a contract with negative numbers (e.g., they pay you), then you might accept, but you are not motivated to.\n\nBut to maximize your chance of winning, you should propose the zero contract.\n\nBecause it's safe, and has a high chance of acceptance.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThis is the only contract that has a reasonable chance of being accepted by both players, and thus of being the winning contract.\n\nAny other contract will cause one player to lose, and they will reject it.\n\nTherefore, to maximize your expected points, you should propose a neutral contract that is likely to be accepted.\n\nThis ensures you have a safe outcome with expected payoff 0, but any other proposal has a high risk of being rejected, leading to the base game, and you might even get less.\n\nSo zero is the only safe and rational choice.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}",

    "response": "Let's break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (without contracts)\n\nThis is a symmetric two-player game with the following payoff matrix (from the perspective of **Player 2**, since you are Player 2):\n\n|                | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Player 2: A0** | (1, -1)      | (-1, 1)      |\n| **Player 2: A1** | (-1, 1)      | (1, -1)      |\n\nThis is a **zero-sum game** (since in each outcome, the sum of payoffs is 0), and it's equivalent to **Matching Pennies**:\n- If both choose the same action (A0/A0 or A1/A1), Player 2 gets 1, Player 1 gets -1.\n- If they differ (A0/A1 or A1/A0), Player 2 gets -1, Player 1 gets 1.\n\nSo:  \n- Player 2 wants to match Player 1's action.\n- But Player 1 wants to mismatch (because their payoff is the negative of Player 2's).\n\nIn the symmetric Nash equilibrium of this game, both players randomize uniformly:  \n- Choose A0 with probability 0.5, A1 with probability 0.5.\n\nAnd in that equilibrium, **expected payoff for each player is 0**, because the outcomes are symmetric and random.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism\n\n- You (Player 2) can propose a **contract**: a pair of numbers: one for A0, one for A1.\n- The contract says: for each action you take, you get (or pay) that extra amount, **in addition** to the original game payoff.\n- The contract must be **accepted by both players** to become active.\n- The other player will also propose a contract.\n- A vote happens: each player approves contracts they like.\n- The winning contract is the one with **most approvals**.\n- If multiple contracts tie for most approvals, the winner is chosen **uniformly at random** among them.\n\nOur goal: **Maximize your expected total points**.\n\nImportant: **You don\u2019t control which contract is implemented.** You only propose one, and the other player proposes one, and the outcome depends on the **voting process**.\n\nYou want to design a contract that:\n1. Is **likely to be accepted** by the other player.\n2. If accepted, improves your **expected payoff**.\n3. Has a **good chance of winning** the vote.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Strategy for Contract Design\n\nLet\u2019s denote your proposed contract as:\n```\n{\"A0\": x, \"A1\": y}\n```\n\nIf the contract is active, then when you choose A0, you receive an additional x points, and the other player loses x points (since it\u2019s drawn from the other player).\nSimilarly: if you choose A1, you get y extra, other player loses y.\n\nBut note: the contract is **only active if both players accept it**.\n\nSo the key question: *Can we make a contract that the other player would want to accept?*\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the other player\u2019s incentives.\n\nSuppose the contract is proposed by you with values (x, y). The other player (Player 1) sees:\n- If they accept, they get:\n  - x points if you choose A0 (i.e., you get x, they lose x \u2013 so net -x for them)\n  - y points if you choose A1 (i.e., you get y, they lose y \u2013 so net -y for them)\n\nBut remember: you choose your action based on your **own** incentives, given the contract and the other player\u2019s strategy.\n\nWait \u2013 this is tricky. The contract affects both your payoff and the other player's payoff, and your behavior in the game depends on the **total** payoff (original + contract), and you may change your mixed strategy.\n\nSo we need to think about **equilibrium under the contract**.\n\nBut since both players choose their actions **simultaneously**, and **only if both accept the contract**, we can model it as a game where both players decide:\n1. Whether to accept the contract.\n2. What strategy to play (probability over A0/A1) if the contract is active.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you propose a contract (x, y). The outcome depends on:\n- Whether the other player accepts it.\n- If both accept, what equilibrium is played?\n\nOur goal is to **maximize your expected payoff**, which is:\n- 0 (if contract not active, base game)\n- Your expected payoff if contract is active (which depends on the game equilibrium under the contract)\n\nSo: if the contract is not accepted, you get 0 expected payoff (because in Nash equilibrium of base game, you get 0).\n\nBut if the contract is accepted, you might get **more than 0**, depending on the contract.\n\nBut you must make the contract **acceptable to Player 1**.\n\nThat is, Player 1 must find it **in their interest** to accept the contract.\n\nNote: Player 1 knows that if the contract is active:\n- Their expected payoff depends on:\n  - The strategy they use (if they play mixed strategy)\n  - The strategy you use (which depends on the total payoffs including contract)\n  - The values x and y\n\nSo we need to design a contract such that, **if Player 1 accepts it**, and we both play optimally (in Nash equilibrium of the new game), then:\n- Our own expected payoff is maximized,\n- But Player 1 still finds it **better than rejecting** (i.e., better than getting 0).\n\nSo we need to **induce a game under the contract** where:\n- You (Player 2) have an incentive to choose certain actions,\n- Player 1 also accepts it,\n- The contract is not too costly to them.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Try to Make the Game Favorable to You\n\nWe want to **increase your payoff** relative to the base game.\n\nBut we can\u2019t force Player 1 to accept something that hurts them.\n\nIdea: **Make the contract such that it makes the other player want to match your choice**, so you can predict their action.\n\nBut note: in the base game, you want to **match** their action, but they want to **mismatch**.\n\nSo if you can **incentivize Player 1 to match you**, then you can increase your payoff.\n\nSuppose you design a contract that gives you a **bonus when you match** the other player.\n\nBut the contract is **on you**, not on them. So you can only give or take **from yourself**, and the money flows come from the other player.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose you propose:\n\n- A0: +1\n- A1: -1\n\nSo:\n- If you choose A0, you get +1 extra.\n- If you choose A1, you pay 1.\n\nSo you\u2019re **rewarding A0** and **punishing A1**.\n\nNow, consider: what happens if the contract is active?\n\nYour total payoff becomes:\n\n|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| **You: A0** | 1+1 = 2 | -1+1 = 0 |\n| **You: A1** | -1-1 = -2 | 1-1 = 0 |\n\nWait: this is not symmetric. But we need to think about **strategies**.\n\nBut the other player (P1) is going to choose their strategy to maximize *their own* total payoff.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the contract is active: you get extra:\n- +1 for A0\n- -1 for A1\n\nSo your total payoff matrix (you are Player 2):\n\n|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| **You: A0** | 1 + 1 = 2 | -1 + 1 = 0 |\n| **You: A1** | -1 - 1 = -2 | 1 - 1 = 0 |\n\nNow, P1\u2019s payoff is just the negative of yours (since the contract is transfer, payoffs sum to zero), so P1\u2019s payoff matrix:\n\n|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| **You: A0** | -2 | 0 |\n| **You: A1** | 2 | 0 |\n\nP1 wants to **minimize your payoff** (since it\u2019s zero-sum), but from their own perspective, they are trying to maximize their own.\n\nSo for P1:\n- If you play A0: P1 gets -2 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1 \u2192 so they prefer A1.\n- If you play A1: P1 gets 2 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1 \u2192 so they prefer A0.\n\nSo P1's best response depends on what you do.\n\nSuppose you mix with probability p on A0, 1-p on A1.\n\nThen your expected total payoff:\n- If you play A0: 2p + 0(1-p) = 2p\n- If you play A1: -2p + 0(1-p) = -2p\n\nSo you will play A0 if 2p > -2p \u2192 4p > 0 \u2192 p > 0 (which is always true if p>0). So if p>0, you prefer A0.\n\nBut you want to choose p to maximize your payoff.\n\nYour expected payoff is:\n- p * (2p) + (1-p) * (-2p) = 2p\u00b2 - 2p(1-p) = 2p\u00b2 - 2p + 2p\u00b2 = 4p\u00b2 - 2p\n\nWait \u2013 that\u2019s not right.\n\nActually: you choose a strategy (p = prob you play A0), P1 chooses their strategy (say q = prob they play A0).\n\nYour expected total payoff:\n\n= p*q*(2) + p*(1-q)*(0) + (1-p)*q*(-2) + (1-p)*(1-q)*(0)\n= 2pq - 2(1-p)q\n= 2pq - 2q + 2pq\n= 4pq - 2q\n\nP1\u2019s expected payoff (negative of yours) = - (4pq - 2q)\n\nP1 wants to maximize their own payoff \u2192 maximize -4pq + 2q\n\nFor a given p, P1 chooses q to maximize -4pq + 2q = q(2 - 4p)\n\nSo:\n- If 2 - 4p > 0 \u2192 p < 0.5 \u2192 P1 sets q = 1 (play A0)\n- If 2 - 4p < 0 \u2192 p > 0.5 \u2192 P1 sets q = 0 (play A1)\n- If p = 0.5 \u2192 indifferent, can play any q.\n\nYou know this. So you choose p to maximize your expected payoff *in equilibrium*.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you set p < 0.5 \u2192 P1 plays A0.\n\nThen your expected payoff = 4p(1) - 2(1) = 4p - 2\n\nMaximize over p < 0.5 \u2192 max at p \u2192 0.5\u207b \u2192 payoff \u2192 4*(0.5) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0\n\nIf you set p > 0.5 \u2192 P1 plays A1 \u2192 your payoff = 4p(0) - 2(0) = 0\n\nIf you set p = 0.5 \u2192 P1 is indifferent \u2192 could play any q \u2192 your payoff = 4*(0.5)q - 2q = 2q - 2q = 0\n\nSo in all cases, your expected payoff is **0** under this contract.\n\nBut P1\u2019s expected payoff is also 0.\n\nBut now, if P1 rejects the contract, they also get **0**.\n\nSo they are **indifferent** to accepting it.\n\nBut is it in their interest to *accept*?\n\nYes \u2014 because they get the same payoff either way.\n\nSo they might accept.\n\nBut we need to be **sure** they accept.\n\nBut now: suppose you propose a contract that gives you **positive gain** when the contract is accepted.\n\nBut let\u2019s try a different idea.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Design a Contract That Makes the Game Less Competitive\n\nIdea: **Make it so that both players have incentive to play A0.**\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you propose:\n\n- A0: +1\n- A1: +1\n\nSo if you play A0 or A1, you get +1 extra.\n\nThen:\n- You get +1 no matter what.\n- The other player loses 1 no matter what \u2192 so they lose 1 for every action they take.\n\nSo their payoff is always decreased by 1.\n\nSo if the contract is active, you get extra 1, they lose 1.\n\nBut they will never accept it \u2014 because no matter what they do, they lose 1.\n\nSo this contract is **not acceptable** to them.\n\nSimilarly: if you give them money (i.e., you pay them), you\u2019re worse off.\n\nSo we want to **induce cooperation** or a favorable equilibrium.\n\nBest idea: **make the contract such that the other player wants to match you**.\n\nBut the other player wants to mismatch in the base game.\n\nBut if you can **reward matching**, and the cost is on you, but you\u2019re willing to pay, then maybe they\u2019ll go along.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you propose:\n\n- A0: +2\n- A1: -2\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0, you gain 2 extra.\n- If you play A1, you lose 2.\n\nNow, your payoff matrix under contract:\n\n|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| **You: A0** | 1+2=3 | -1+2=1 |\n| **You: A1** | -1-2=-3 | 1-2=-1 |\n\nP1\u2019s payoff (sum to zero, so negative):\n\n|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| **You: A0** | -3 | -1 |\n| **You: A1** | 3 | 1 |\n\nSo P1 wants to minimize your payoff.\n\nIf you play A0 \u2192 P1 gets -3 if they play A0, -1 if they play A1 \u2192 so they prefer A1.\n\nIf you play A1 \u2192 P1 gets 3 if A0, 1 if A1 \u2192 so they prefer A0.\n\nSame as before.\n\nYour expected payoff: if you mix p, P1 mixes q.\n\nYour payoff: p*q*3 + p*(1-q)*1 + (1-p)*q*(-3) + (1-p)*(1-q)*(-1)\n\n= 3pq + p - pq -3q + 3pq - (1-p)(1-q) wait, better:\n\n= p*q*3 + p*(1-q)*1 + (1-p)*q*(-3) + (1-p)*(1-q)*(-1)\n\n= 3pq + p(1-q) - 3q(1-p) - (1-p)(1-q)\n\n= 3pq + p - pq - 3q + 3pq - (1 - p - q + pq)\n\n= (3pq - pq + 3pq) + p - 3q -1 + p + q - pq\n\n= (5pq) + 2p - 2q - 1 - pq\n\n= 4pq + 2p - 2q - 1\n\nNow, P1 chooses q to maximize their payoff, which is negative of yours: -4pq -2p +2q +1\n\nFor fixed p, maximize over q: -4p q + 2q + (...) = q(-4p + 2) + const\n\nSo if -4p + 2 > 0 \u2192 p < 0.5 \u2192 P1 sets q=1\nIf p > 0.5 \u2192 P1 sets q=0\nIf p=0.5 \u2192 indifferent\n\nThen your expected payoff:\n\n- If p<0.5, q=1 \u2192 payoff = 4p(1) + 2p - 2(1) -1 = 4p + 2p - 2 -1 = 6p - 3\nMax at p\u21920.5\u207b \u2192 6*0.5 -3 = 3-3=0\n\n- If p>0.5, q=0 \u2192 payoff = 0 + 2p - 0 -1 = 2p -1 \u2192 at p\u21920.5\u207a \u2192 1-1=0\n\n- If p=0.5 \u2192 q\u4efb\u610f, but since q(-4*0.5 +2)=q(0), so payoff = 0 + 2*0.5 -2q -1 = 1 -2q -1 = -2q \u2192 max when q=0 \u2192 payoff = 0\n\nSo again, payoff = 0 in equilibrium.\n\nStill no gain.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Realization \u2013 The Game is Zero-Sum and Symmetric\n\nThis game is **zero-sum and symmetric**, so any linear transformation (like adding constants to payoffs) doesn't change the game structure\u2014just shifts payoffs.\n\nBut the **contract** is a transfer between players, so it changes incentives.\n\nHowever, **because both players are rational and know each other's payoffs**, they will play Nash equilibrium.\n\nIn a two-player zero-sum game, the Nash equilibrium outcome is unique in terms of expected payoff (here: 0 for each).\n\nBut if you add a **transfer**, the game remains zero-sum, so the equilibrium payoff remains 0 **if both accept**.\n\nWhy? Because zero-sum games have the value equal to the minimax value.\n\nSo even with the contract, if both players accept, the game is still zero-sum, so **each player's expected payoff (including contract) will be 0 in equilibrium**.\n\nBut your contract payoffs are **not zero-sum** for the contract part if you only get extra from the other player.\n\nWait \u2014 yes, the contract part **is** zero-sum: if you get +x, they lose x.\n\nSo the **entire game** is still zero-sum.\n\nTherefore, **in any equilibrium under the contract, the expected payoff for both players is 0**.\n\nSo if the contract is active, you get **0** expected payoff (same as base game).\n\nBut if the contract is **not active**, you also get 0.\n\nSo you are **indifferent** between contract being active or not.\n\nBut now: suppose you propose a **contract that makes you better off only if the other player accepts and plays suboptimally**, but that\u2019s not stable.\n\nNo: since it\u2019s zero-sum, equilibrium is 0.\n\nSo you get 0 in either case.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **what if the contract makes the other player want to accept it even if you don\u2019t gain, but you do?**\n\nNo \u2014 if you get 0 from the contract and they get 0 from rejecting, they are indifferent.\n\nBut if you design a contract that gives **them** a benefit when the contract is active, they will accept.\n\nFor example, suppose you propose:\n\n- A0: -1\n- A1: -1\n\nSo you pay 1 no matter what.\n\nThen:\n- You lose 1 in total, no matter what.\n- Other player gains 1.\n\nIf the contract is active, you get -1 (in contract) + your base game payoff of 0 \u2192 total -1.\n\nBut if you reject, you get 0.\n\nSo you are worse off if contract is active.\n\nSo this is terrible for you.\n\nSo you **must design a contract that is attractive to the other player**.\n\nBut if you give them a benefit, you pay more.\n\nBut if you give them a benefit, they might accept.\n\nWait: let\u2019s try to give them a **win**, but in a way that you still benefit.\n\nIdea: **Make the contract such that if both players cooperate**, they both get better payoff.\n\nBut since it's zero-sum, they can't both win.\n\nBut the contract can make the base game asymmetric.\n\nLet\u2019s try to **reward matching**.\n\nSuppose you propose:\n\n- A0: +1\n- A1: +1\n\nYou get +1 in both cases.\n\nBut then you pay 1 in total, so other player loses 1 in total.\n\nSo if the game is played, you get 1 extra, they lose 1.\n\nBut then they are worse off \u2192 they won\u2019t accept.\n\nBut what if you **take a loss in one action** to reward the other?\n\nWait: you want them to accept.\n\nSo what if you propose a contract that **gives them a gain**?\n\nSuppose you propose:\n\n- A0: -1\n- A1: -1\n\nYou pay 1 no matter what.\n\nThen they gain 1 no matter what.\n\nSo they get +1 extra, you get -1 extra.\n\nSo if the contract is active, you get -1 + 0 = -1\n\nThey get +1 + 0 = +1\n\nBut if they reject, both get 0.\n\nSo they are better off accepting.\n\nBut you are worse off.\n\nSo you wouldn't want this.\n\nUnless... you can get more from the game than -1.\n\nBut in equilibrium, you still get 0 from the game.\n\nSo total: you get -1, they get +1.\n\nWorse for you.\n\nSo not good.\n\nBut here's a different idea.\n\n### Step 7: Break the Symmetry \u2013 Make the Game Favor the Other Player\u2019s Incentive to Cooperate\n\nSuppose you propose a contract:\n\n- A0: +1\n- A1: 0\n\nSo if you play A0, you get +1 extra.\nIf you play A1, no extra.\n\nNow, your total payoff matrix:\n\n|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| **You: A0** | 1+1=2 | -1+1=0 |\n| **You: A1** | -1+0=-1 | 1+0=1 |\n\nP1\u2019s payoff:\n\n|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| **You: A0** | -2 | 0 |\n| **You: A1** | 1 | -1 |\n\nP1 wants to minimize your payoff.\n\nIf you play A0: P1 gets -2 (A0) or 0 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1.\nIf you play A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) or -1 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1.\n\nSo no matter what, P1 prefers to play A1.\n\nSo P1 will play A1 with probability 1.\n\nThen your best response:\n- A0: if P1 plays A1, you get 0\n- A1: you get 1\n\nSo you play A1.\n\nSo equilibrium: you play A1, P1 plays A1.\n\nThen your total payoff = 1 (base) + 0 (contract) = 1\nP1\u2019s payoff = -1 (base) + 0 (contract) = -1\n\nBut P1 gets -1 if contract is active.\n\nIf contract is not active, P1 gets 0.\n\nSo P1 is worse off.\n\nSo they won't accept.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat if you make the contract so that P1 is better off if you play A0?\n\nSuppose you propose:\n\n- A0: +1\n- A1: -1\n\nThen:\n- If you play A0, you gain 1, they lose 1.\n- If you play A1, you lose 1, they gain 1.\n\nNow, P1 wants to minimize your payoff.\n\nIf you play A0: P1 gets -2 (A0) or 0 (A1) \u2192 prefers A1.\nIf you play A1: P1 gets 2 (A0) or 0 (A1) \u2192 prefers A0.\n\nStill the same.\n\nBut notice: if you play A0, P1 prefers A1.\nIf you play A1, P1 prefers A0.\n\nSo they will mirror you.\n\nSo in equilibrium, they will play the same as you.\n\nSo if you play A0 with probability p, they play A0 with probability p.\n\nThen your expected payoff:\n\n- With prob p (you A0), they A0: you get 2\n- With prob p (you A0), they A1: you get 0\n- With prob 1-p (you A1), they A0: you get 0\n- With prob 1-p (you A1), they A1: you get 0\n\nWait no:\n\nIf you play A0, P1 plays A0 with prob p, but in best response, if you play A0, P1 plays A1.\n\nSo if you play A0, P1 plays A1.\n\nIf you play A1, P1 plays A0.\n\nSo the action profile is:\n- You A0 \u2192 P1 A1\n- You A1 \u2192 P1 A0\n\nSo they are always different.\n\nSo your outcome: you get -1 (because A0 vs A1) or -1 (A1 vs A0) \u2192 always -1\n\nBase game: -1, contract: +1 if A0, -1 if A1 \u2192 so:\n- If you play A0: -1 +1 = 0\n- If you play A1: -1 -1 = -2\n\nSo you will play A0.\n\nThen you get 0, P1 gets 1 (base -1, contract -1? Wait.\n\nWait, contract: if you play A0, you get +1, so P1 loses 1, so P1 gets -1 -1 = -2\n\nIf you play A1, you get -1, so P1 gains 1, so P1 gets -1 +1 = 0\n\nBut if you play A0, P1 plays A1, payoff: P1 gets 1 (from game) -1 (contract) = 0\n\nLet's compute:\n\n- You play A0, P1 plays A1:\n  - Base game: you -1, P1 1\n  - Contract: you get +1, P1 loses 1\n  - Total: you -1 +1 = 0, P1 1 -1 = 0\n\n- Similarly, if you play A1, P1 plays A0: you -1, P1 1, contract: you -1, P1 +1, so total: you -2, P1 2\n\nBut P1 will not play A0 if you play A1.\n\nBut if you play A0, P1 plays A1, get 0.\nIf you play A1, P1 plays A0, get 2 (in total? No)\n\nWait: in this case, if you play A0, P1 plays A1, P1's total payoff = 1 (game) -1 (contract) = 0\nIf you play A1, P1 plays A0, P1's payoff = -1 (game) +1 (contract) = 0\n\nSo P1 is indifferent.\n\nSo you can play A0.\nThen you get 0 (game) +1 (contract) = 1\nP1 gets 1 (game) -1 (contract) = 0\n\nSo you get 1, they get 0.\n\nIf contract not active, both get 0.\n\nSo they are indifferent, since they get 0 either way.\n\nBut you get 1 if contract active.\n\nSo you want them to accept.\n\nAnd they are indifferent, so they might accept.\n\nAnd since you get more, you should propose this contract.\n\nBut can you do better?\n\nWhat if you propose a contract where you get more when you match.\n\nBest: make the contract such that if you play A0, you get +1, and if you play A1, you get -1, but we just saw that if you play A0 with certaninity, you get 1, P1 gets 0.\n\nBut P1 might not accept if they think you will play A0.\n\nBut in equilibrium, you play A0, they are indifferent.\n\nSo they are willing to accept.\n\nSo it's in their interest to accept if they are not worse off.\n\nThey are not worse off.\n\nSo they will accept.\n\nAnd you get 1.\n\nBut is there a better one?\n\nWhat if you propose:\n\n- A0: +2\n- A1: -1\n\nThen if you play A0, you get +2, P1 loses 2.\nIf you play A1, you get -1, P1 gains 1.\n\nThen P1 will play A1 if you play A0, A0 if you play A1.\n\nSo if you play A0: you get -1 +2 = 1, P1 gets 1 -2 = -1\nIf you play A1: you get -1 -1 = -2, P1 gets -1 +1 = 0\n\nSo you prefer to play A0.\nP1 gets -1 if you play A0.\nIf contract not active, they get 0.\nSo they are worse off.\nSo they won't accept.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, the only way for P1 to be at least as well off is if their payoff is >= 0 when the contract is active.\n\nIn the contract: A0: +1, A1: -1\n\n- If you play A0, P1 gets 0 (game 1, contract -1 =0)\n- If you play A1, P1 gets 0 (game -1, contract +1 =0)\n\nSo P1 gets 0 in both cases, same as not accepting.\n\nSo they are indifferent.\n\nSo they will accept.\n\nYou get 1.\n\nIs there a contract where you get more than 1?\n\nSuppose you propose A0: +1, A1: 0\n\nThen if you play A0, P1 plays A1, so P1 gets 1 -1 =0 (contracts: you gain 1, so P1 loses 1)\nIf you play A1, P1 plays A0, P1 gets -1 +0 = -1\n\nSo if you play A0, P1 gets 0.\nIf you play A1, P1 gets -1.\n\nBut you will play A0, so P1 gets 0.\n\nSo they are indifferent.\n\nYou get -1 +1 =0.\n\nSo you get 0, worse than before.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, the best is:\n- A0: +1\n- A1: -1\n\nThen you get 1, they get 0 (indifferent, so may accept).\n\nAnd in the vote, you might win.\n\nBut you want to maximize your expected payoff.\n\nBut there's a catch.\n\nThe other player also proposes a contract.\n\nYou don't control it.\n\nSuppose you propose (A0: +1, A1: -1)\n\nSuppose the other player proposes (A0: 0, A1: 0) \u2014 nothing.\n\nThen:\n- You will accept only if the contract is at least as good as 0.\n- You get 1 if this contract is active, 0 otherwise.\n- So you prefer this one.\n\nThe other player: if your contract is active, they get 0.\nIf their contract is active, they get 0 (since it's zero).\nSo they are indifferent.\nSo they might accept both.\n\nThen both are approved.\n\nThen which contract wins? The one with more approvals.\n\nBoth have two approvals.\n\nSo winning contract is chosen uniformly at random.\n\nSo 50% chance your contract wins.\n\nSo you get 1 with probability 0.5, 0 with probability 0.5.\n\nExpected payoff: 0.5\n\nBut if you propose (0,0), you get 0.\n\nSo better to propose (1, -1)\n\nBut can you do better?\n\nSuppose you propose (A0: +2, A1: -2)\n\nThen if it's active:\n- You play A0, they play A1: you get -1+2=1, they get 1-2= -1\n\nSo they get -1 < 0, so they won't accept.\n\nSo you get 0.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo you can't.\n\nWhat if you propose (A0: +1, A1: -1), as before.\n\nThen in the equilibrium, you get 1, they get 0.\n\nThey accept.\n\nBut the other player might propose a contract that forces you to lose.\n\nBut you can't control, but you can choose to propose one that is safe.\n\nBut you can also propose a contract that makes you get more in expectation.\n\nBut in equilibrium, your payoff is 1 if the contract is active.\n\nAnd you get it only if the contract wins and you both accept.\n\nSince both accept, and only one contract wins, your EV is:\n\n- P(win vote) * 1\n\nTo maximize this, you want high P(win).\n\nBut if you propose (1, -1), and the other player proposes (0,0), then your contract has one approval (yours), the other has two (both).\n\nSo (0,0) wins.\n\nSo you get 0.\n\nOh! Critical point.\n\nEven if you are willing to accept, if the other player proposes a contract that they want, and they accept it, and you might accept it, then the winning contract could be theirs.\n\nBut you want to design a contract that has a good chance of winning.\n\nSo you need to propose a contract that is attractive to the other player.\n\nIn this case, if you propose (1, -1), they are indifferent, so they might accept.\n\nBut if the other player proposes (0,0), then:\n- Your contract: you accept (you get 1 if active), they are indifferent, so may accept.\n- Their contract: they accept (get 0), you might accept (get 0, same as before).\n\nSo both might be accepted.\n\nThen approvals: you approve (1, -1), they approve both.\n\nSo (1, -1) has 1 approval, (0,0) has 2 approvals.\n\nSo (0,0) wins.\n\nYou get 0.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo you need to propose a contract that the other player **wants** to accept, and you can try to make it win.\n\nBut if you propose a contract that is not attractive to them, they won't accept.\n\nSo the only way is to propose a contract that they accept.\n\nBut to increase your chances, you can propose a contract that they **want** to accept, and you accept.\n\nSuppose you propose:\n\n- A0: +1\n- A1: +1\n\nThen you are paying 1, they are receiving 1.\n\nSo if contract active, you get -1 +0 = -1, they get +1 +0 = +1.\n\nSo they are better off.\n\nSo they will accept.\n\nYou are worse off.\n\nSo you might not want to accept.\n\nSo you won't approve.\n\nThen contract has only one approval (theirs), so might not win.\n\nSo not good.\n\nSuppose you propose (A0: 1, A1: 0)\n\nThen if active, you might get 0, they get 0 or 1.\n\nBut in equilibrium, you play A0, they play A1, so you get 0, they get 0.\n\nSo they are indifferent.\n\nYou might accept.\n\nBut you get 0, same as not accepting.\n\nBut you might accept.\n\nBut the other player may also propose something.\n\nBut the key is: you want to increase your expected payoff.\n\nAfter all, in the best case, you get 1.\n\nBut you need to make sure it wins.\n\nSo the only way is to make a contract that is attractive to the other player, and they will accept, and you accept, and it wins.\n\nSuppose you propose (A0: +1, A1: -1)\n\nThen they are indifferent, so they will accept.\n\nYou are getting 1, so you accept.\n\nSo both accept.\n\nNow, the other player proposes a contract, say (0,0).\n\nThen:\n- You accept (1,-1)\n- You accept (0,0) (since 0 is same as not accepting)\n- They accept (0,0)\n- They might accept (1,-1) because they are indifferent.\n\nSo both might have 2 approvals.\n\nThen random choice.\n\nYou have 50% chance to get 1.\n\nExpected payoff: 0.5\n\nBut if you propose (0,0), you get 0.\n\nSo better.\n\nBut can you do better?\n\nSuppose you propose (A0: +1, A1: -2)\n\nThen if active, and you play A0, you get -1+1=0, they get 1-1=0\nIf you play A1, you get -1-2= -3, they get 1+2=3\n\nSo you will play A0.\nP1 gets 0.\n\nSo they are indifferent.\n\nYou get 0.\n\nSo you might accept.\n\nBut you get 0.\n\nWorse than 0.5 expected.\n\nSo not good.\n\nAfter all, the best you can do is expect 0.5.\n\nBut let's assume that the other player will not accept a contract that makes them worse off.\n\nSo to be safe, propose (1, -1)\n\nOr even (0,0) is safe, but you get nothing.\n\nBut (1, -1) gives you expected 0.5.\n\nAnd it's the best possible.\n\nBut there's a better idea.\n\nSuppose you propose (A0: 0, A1: 0)\n\nThen both are indifferent.\n\nBut if the other player proposes (1, -1), then you might accept it (get 1), they get 0, so they might accept.\n\nThen (1, -1) has two approvals, wins.\n\nYou get 1.\n\nBut you don't control that.\n\nBut you can choose to propose (1, -1) to try to win.\n\nBut to maximize expected payoff, you can't control what the other player proposes.\n\nBut since you are designing your own, and the other player is rational, you can assume they will propose a contract that is in their interest.\n\nBut to be conservative, you should propose (1, -1)\n\nOr even better: (0,0) is safe, you get 0.\n\nBut (1, -1) gives expected 0.5.\n\nBut if the other player proposes a contract that you accept, and it wins, you get 1.\n\nBut with (1, -1), your expected payoff is at least 0.\n\nBut you can't control.\n\nBut since the contract winning is random, and you want to maximize your ex-ante expected payoff, and (1, -1) has a chance, you should propose it.\n\nAfter careful thought, the best is to propose:\n\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": -1}\n\nThis makes you get 1 if the contract is active, and the other player is indifferent, so they will accept.\n\nYou will accept.\n\nThen if it wins the vote, you get 1.\n\nEven if not, you get 0.\n\nBy making the other player indifferent, you make it likely to win.\n\nAnd you get expected gain.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": -1}",
