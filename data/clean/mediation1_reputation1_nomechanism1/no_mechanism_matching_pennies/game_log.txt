response:
To determine the best probability distribution over the available actions (A0 and A1) to maximize my total points, let's analyze the given payoff matrix and consider the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies in this scenario.

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoffs
The payoffs are as follows:
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A0: you get 1 point.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: you get -1 point.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: you get -1 point.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A1: you get 1 point.

### Step 2: Recognizing the Zero-Sum Nature
This is a zero-sum game, where one player's gain is another player's loss.

### Step 3: Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
In zero-sum games like this, one way to play optimally is to find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Here, we need to determine probabilities \(p\) (for A0) and \(1-p\) (for A1) that make the other player indifferent between choosing A0 and A1.

Since both players are in symmetric positions in terms of payoffs (Player 1's gain is Player 2's loss and vice versa), we can argue that both players should be indifferent between their choices by setting expectations equal.

### Step 4: Setting Up the Equations
Let:
- \(p\) be my probability of choosing A0.
- \(1-p\) be my probability of choosing A1.
- \(q\) be Player 1's probability of choosing A0.
- \(1-q\) be Player 1's probability of choosing A1.

The other player's expected payoff if they choose A0:
\[ E(A0) = 1*q + (-1)*(1-q) = 2q - 1 \]

The other player's expected payoff if they choose A1:
\[ E(A1) = (-1)*q + 1*(1-q) = -2q + 1 \]

For the other player to be indifferent:
\[ 2q - 1 = -2q + 1 \]
\[ 4q = 2 \]
\[ q = \frac{1}{2} \]

Similarly for us to be indifferent:
\[ E(A0) = (-1)*q + 1*(1-q) \]
\[ E(A1) = 1*q + (-1)*(1-q) \]

Which simplifies to:
\[ -2p + 1 = 2p - 1 \]
\[ 4p = 2 \]
\[ p = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Step 5: Final Probability Distribution
Both players should choose A0 and A1 with equal probability, because this strategy does not give any advantage to the other player and keeps the game fair in terms of expected value.

Given that \(p = 50\% \) for A0 and \(1-p = 50\% \) for A1, I should use the following distribution.

response:
The game described is a classic zero-sum game known as Matching Pennies. You are Player 1, and your task is to choose a probability distribution over two actions, A0 and A1, to maximize your total points.

The payoff matrix for Player 1 is:
- (A0, A0): 1
- (A0, A1): -1
- (A1, A0): -1
- (A1, A1): 1

Let $p$ be the probability that you choose A0 and $q$ be the probability that the other player chooses A0. Your expected payoff is given by:
$E = p[q(1) + (1-q)(-1)] + (1-p)[q(-1) + (1-q)(1)]$
$E = q(2p-1) - (1-q)(2p-1)$
$E = (2p-1)(2q-1)$

To maximize your points in a zero-sum competitive environment where the other player is also trying to optimize their own results (which is to minimize your payoff), the optimal strategy is the Nash Equilibrium. In this symmetric game, the Nash Equilibrium occurs when both players choose each action with a probability of 0.5. 

If you choose $p = 0.5$, your expected payoff is $(2(0.5)-1)(2q-1) = 0$, regardless of the other player's choice ($q$). Deviating from $p = 0.5$ would allow the other player to choose a $q$ that results in a negative expected payoff for you. Therefore, the safest and most optimal strategy in this scenario is to distribute your probabilities equally.

response:
To maximize points in this zero-sum game (similar to the game of "Matching Pennies"), we need to identify the optimal strategy.

1.  **Analyze the Payoff Matrix:**
    *   (P1=A0, P2=A0): You get 1, Other gets -1
    *   (P1=A0, P2=A1): You get -1, Other gets 1
    *   (P1=A1, P2=A0): You get -1, Other gets 1
    *   (P1=A1, P2=A1): You get 1, Other gets -1

2.  **Determine the Objectives:**
    *   As Player 1, you want to match the other player's choice (A0-A0 or A1-A1).
    *   The other player, to maximize their own points, wants to mismatch your choice (A0-A1 or A1-A0).

3.  **Find the Nash Equilibrium:**
    *   If you choose A0 more frequently than A1, the other player can exploit this by choosing A1 more frequently to ensure you lose points.
    *   If you choose A1 more frequently than A0, the other player can exploit this by choosing A0 more frequently.
    *   To prevent exploitation and find the optimal strategy in a zero-sum game where goals are diametrically opposed, you should play each action with a 50% probability. This ensures that regardless of the other player's strategy, your expected value remains 0 and cannot be forced lower.

4.  **Final Probability Distribution:**
    *   Setting both A0 and A1 to 50% is the minimax strategy and the Nash equilibrium for this game. It maximizes your security and is the standard decision-making approach when playing against a rational opponent in this context.

response:
To maximize points in this zero-sum game (specifically a version of the game "Matching Pennies"), we analyze the payoff structure:

1.  **Analyze the Payoff Matrix:**
    *   (A0, A0): You get 1, Other gets -1
    *   (A0, A1): You get -1, Other gets 1
    *   (A1, A0): You get -1, Other gets 1
    *   (A1, A1): You get 1, Other gets -1

    This is a zero-sum game where Player 1 (you) wins if both players choose the same action, and Player 2 wins if the actions are different.

2.  **Determine the Nash Equilibrium:**
    In a one-shot or repeated Matching Pennies game, no pure strategy is stable. If you always choose A0, the other player will choose A1 to win. If you always choose A1, the other player will choose A0 to win.
    To find the mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium, let $p$ be the probability you choose A0 and $q$ be the probability the other player chooses A0.
    *   Your expected payoff: $E = p[q(1) + (1-q)(-1)] + (1-p)[q(-1) + (1-q)(1)]$
    *   $E = p(2q - 1) + (1-p)(1 - 2q)$
    *   $E = 2pq - p + 1 - 2q - p + 2pq = 4pq - 2p - 2q + 1$

    To make your payoff independent of the other player's choice ($q$), you solve $\frac{\partial E}{\partial q} = 4p - 2 = 0$, which gives $p = 0.5$.
    Similarly, the other player will minimize your payoff by setting $q = 0.5$.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    The optimal strategy in this environment, without any information about the other player's tendencies, is to play both actions with equal probability (50% for A0 and 50% for A1). This prevents the other player from being able to exploit a predictable pattern and guarantees an expected value of 0 in this zero-sum scenario.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for this decision-making game, let's first analyze the game's structure and payouts while focusing on our objective to maximize our total points.

**Game Analysis:**

1. **Payoff Matrix:**
   - If Player 2 (P2) chooses A0:
     - P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 1 point.
     - P1 chooses A1: P2 gets -1 point.
   - If Player 2 (P2) chooses A1:
     - P1 chooses A0: P2 gets -1 point.
     - P1 chooses A1: P2 gets 1 point.

2. **Symmetrical Payoffs:**
   - The payoffs are symmetrical with respect to the chosen actions for both players.
   - Each player receives 1 point when their actions match, and -1 point otherwise.

**Mixed Strategy Analysis:**

Since this game resembles a version of the Matching Pennies game where each player receives opposite payouts, a pure strategy (always choosing A0 or A1) results in predictability, allowing the opponent to always counter.

Thus, the optimal strategy typically involves mixing actions with some probability. Both players would need to randomize their choices to avoid being exploited.

3. **Expected Payoff Calculation:**
   - Let:
     - \( p \) be the probability that Player 1 (P1) selects A0.
     - \( q \) be the probability that Player 2 (P2) selects A0.
     - The remaining probabilities for selecting A1 are \( 1-p \) and \( 1-q \) respectively.
   
4. **P2's Expected Payoff:**
   - Choosing A0:
     \[ \text{Expected Payoff}_{A0} = p \times 1 + (1 - p) \times (-1) \]
     \[ \text{Expected Payoff}_{A0} = p - (1 - p) = 2p - 1 \]
   - Choosing A1:
     \[ \text{Expected Payoff}_{A1} = p \times (-1) + (1 - p) \times 1 \]
     \[ \text{Expected Payoff}_{A1} = -p + (1 - p) = -2p + 1 \]

5. **Finding the Equilibrium:**
   - Set expected payoffs equal to find the indifference point:
     \[ 2p - 1 = -2p + 1 \]
     \[ 2p + 2p = 1 + 1 \]
     \[ 4p = 2 \]
     \[ p = \frac{1}{2} \]

So, both P1 and P2 should ideally select each action (A0 and A1) with equal probability to ensure that neither can predict and exploit the other.

Therefore, since P2 should randomize equally between A0 and A1:

response:
The game described is a classic zero-sum game known as "Matching Pennies." In this game, Player 1 (the "matcher") wins if both players choose the same action, while Player 2 (the "mismatcher") wins if the actions are different.

To analyze the optimal strategy, let's look at the payoff matrix for Player 1:
- **(A0, A0):** +1
- **(A0, A1):** -1
- **(A1, A0):** -1
- **(A1, A1):** +1

If Player 1 chooses A0 with probability $p$ and A1 with probability $1-p$, and Player 2 chooses A0 with probability $q$ and A1 with probability $1-q$, the expected value ($EV$) for Player 1 is:
$EV = p[q(1) + (1-q)(-1)] + (1-p)[q(-1) + (1-q)(1)]$
$EV = p(2q - 1) + (1-p)(1 - 2q)$
$EV = (2p - 1)(2q - 1)$

To maximize points and avoid being exploited by the other player, Player 1 should seek the Nash Equilibrium. If Player 1 chooses $p = 0.5$ (a 50% probability for A0), the expected value becomes:
$EV = (2(0.5) - 1)(2q - 1) = 0 \cdot (2q - 1) = 0$

By choosing both actions with equal probability, Player 1 ensures an expected payoff of 0 regardless of Player 2's strategy. Any deviation from 50/50 would allow an observant opponent to choose a strategy that makes Player 1's expected payoff negative. Following the Nash Equilibrium is the most robust strategy in this competitive game.

response:
To maximize the total points in this zero-sum game (a classic "Matching Pennies" scenario), we must determine the most robust strategy.

1.  **Analyze the Payoffs:**
    - (A0, A0): You receive 1, the opponent receives -1.
    - (A0, A1): You receive -1, the opponent receives 1.
    - (A1, A0): You receive -1, the opponent receives 1.
    - (A1, A1): You receive 1, the opponent receives -1.
    In this setup, your objective is to have your action match the opponent's action, while the opponent's objective is to have their action differ from yours.

2.  **Identify the Nash Equilibrium:**
    Let $p$ be your probability of choosing A0 and $q$ be the opponent's probability of choosing A0. Your expected payoff ($EV$) is:
    $$EV = 1pq - 1p(1-q) - 1(1-p)q + 1(1-p)(1-q)$$
    $$EV = 4pq - 2p - 2q + 1$$
    To find the minimax strategy, you choose $p$ such that your payoff is guaranteed regardless of what $q$ the opponent chooses. Setting the derivative with respect to $q$ to zero (or solving for when the opponent cannot influence the result):
    $4p - 2 = 0 \implies p = 0.5$ (or 50%)

3.  **Determine Your Strategy:**
    If you choose $p = 0.5$, your expected payoff is $EV = 4(0.5)q - 2(0.5) - 2q + 1 = 0$, regardless of the opponent's strategy. Any deviation from 50/50 could be exploited by an opponent who discovers your bias (e.g., if you play A0 60% of the time, an opponent playing A1 100% of the time will cause you to lose more than you win). In a environment with no information about the opponent, 50% for each action is the most stable and optimal strategy.

Let's analyze the game step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

We are Player 2. The payoffs are given from the perspective of each player in each outcome.

Let’s write the payoff matrix with Player 1’s action on rows and Player 2’s action on columns. The payoffs are (Player 1, Player 2).

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (1, -1)     | (-1, 1)     |
| **Player 1: A1** | (-1, 1)     | (1, -1)     |

But since we are Player 2, our goal is to maximize **our own points**, so we want to maximize the second number in each pair.

---

### Step 2: Identify the Game Type

This is a **zero-sum game**? Let's check:

- (1, -1): sum = 0
- (-1, 1): sum = 0
- (-1, 1): sum = 0
- (1, -1): sum = 0

Yes, total payoff is always 0. So it's a **zero-sum game**.

In zero-sum games, the optimal strategy is a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**, where each player chooses probabilities to make the other player indifferent between their choices.

---

### Step 3: Find the Nash Equilibrium

Let’s denote:

- Let **p** = probability that Player 1 plays A0 (we don’t control this, but we assume they play optimally).
- Let **q** = probability that Player 2 (us) plays A0.

We want to find the optimal **q** such that our expected payoff is maximized, assuming Player 1 is playing optimally (and vice versa).

But since we are solving for our strategy, and assuming the other player will also play optimally, we look for the Nash equilibrium.

Let’s compute Player 2’s expected payoff based on Player 1’s strategy and our mixed strategy.

But in symmetric zero-sum games, sometimes the symmetric equilibrium is to play each action with 50% chance.

Let’s **test whether playing A0 with 50% and A1 with 50% is optimal**.

But first, let's suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability **p**, A1 with **1-p**.

Then our expected payoff from choosing A0 is:

- If we play A0: 
  - With prob p, Player 1 plays A0 → we get -1
  - With prob 1-p, Player 1 plays A1 → we get 1
  - So expected payoff = p*(-1) + (1-p)*(1) = -p + 1 - p = 1 - 2p

Expected payoff from choosing A1:
- If we play A1:
  - With prob p, Player 1 plays A0 → we get 1
  - With prob 1-p, Player 1 plays A1 → we get -1
  - Expected = p*(1) + (1-p)*(-1) = p - 1 + p = 2p - 1

Now, in equilibrium, Player 2 should be indifferent between A0 and A1 only if Player 1 is playing optimally. But we are Player 2, so we want to choose **q** such that **Player 1 is indifferent** between A0 and A1? Wait — no.

Actually, in zero-sum games, we want to choose our mixed strategy so that **the opponent cannot exploit us** — that is, we make them indifferent between their actions.

But since we are Player 2, and we want to maximize our payoff **assuming Player 1 is also playing optimally**, we should find the mixed strategy that guarantees the best worst-case payoff.

Alternatively, symmetric analysis:

This game is symmetric: the structure is symmetric in a way.

But notice: the payoffs are anti-symmetric.

Let’s see: if both players play A0 → P1 gets 1, P2 gets -1.

If both play A1 → P1 gets 1, P2 gets -1.

If they differ → the one who plays A0 gets -1, the other gets 1.

Wait — this is actually:

- You get 1 if both players play the **same** action.
- You get -1 if they play **different** actions.

Let’s verify:

- (A0, A0): same → +1 → yes, P2 gets -1? Wait — no.

Hold on: from Player 2’s perspective:

- (A0, A0): you get -1 → but same action → but you get -1
- (A0, A1): you get 1 → different → you get 1
- (A1, A0): you get 1 → different → you get 1
- (A1, A1): you get -1 → same → you get -1

So actually:

- You get **1** if you and the other player choose **different** actions.
- You get **-1** if you choose the **same** action.

That’s the payoff rule.

So: **You want to mismatch the other player’s action.**

You get +1 when actions differ, -1 when they match.

This is a classic **matching pennies** game.

Yes! This is **Matching Pennies**, a well-known game.

In Matching Pennies:
- One player wants to match, the other wants to mismatch.
- But in this case, **Player 2 gets +1 when actions differ**, so Player 2 wants to **mismatch**.
- Player 1: from their view:
  - (A0, A0): gets +1 → match → wants to match
  - (A1, A1): gets +1 → match → wants to match
  - (A0, A1): gets -1 → mismatch → doesn’t want mismatch
  - (A1, A0): gets -1 → mismatch → doesn’t want mismatch

So **Player 1 wants to match**, **Player 2 wants to mismatch**.

Hence, this is standard **matching pennies**, where one player wants to match, the other to mismatch.

The Nash equilibrium is to play each action with 50% probability.

Why? Because if Player 2 plays A0 with 50%, then Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1:

If Player 1 plays A0:
- With prob 0.5, Player 2 plays A0 → result is match → Player 1 gets +1
- With prob 0.5, Player 2 plays A1 → mismatch → Player 1 gets -1
- Expected payoff: (0.5)(1) + (0.5)(-1) = 0

If Player 1 plays A1:
- With prob 0.5, Player 2 plays A0 → mismatch → Player 1 gets -1
- With prob 0.5, Player 2 plays A1 → match → Player 1 gets +1
- Expected payoff: (0.5)(-1) + (0.5)(1) = 0

So Player 1 is indifferent. Thus, any mixture is best response — including 50-50.

Similarly, if Player 1 plays 50-50, then Player 2’s expected payoff:

If Player 2 plays A0:
- Prob Player 1 plays A0 = 0.5 → same → P2 gets -1
- Prob Player 1 plays A1 = 0.5 → different → P2 gets +1
- Expected: 0.5*(-1) + 0.5*(1) = 0

If Player 2 plays A1:
- Prob Player 1 plays A0 = 0.5 → different → P2 gets +1
- Prob Player 1 plays A1 = 0.5 → same → P2 gets -1
- Expected: 0.5*(1) + 0.5*(-1) = 0

So Player 2 is also indifferent. So playing 50-50 is a best response.

Thus, the **unique Nash equilibrium** is for both players to play A0 with 50% and A1 with 50%.

Since we are Player 2, and we want to maximize our guaranteed (minimax) expected payoff, the optimal strategy is to play **A0 with 50% and A1 with 50%**.

This ensures we get an **expected payoff of 0**, no matter what the other player does — and it's the best we can guarantee in a zero-sum game.

Any deviation could be exploited.

Let's analyze the game step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix**

We are Player 2. The payoffs are given from the perspective of the player choosing the action. Let’s write the payoff matrix with Player 1 as the row player and Player 2 (you) as the column player.

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------------------|----|----|
| **A0**              | (1, -1) | (-1, 1) |
| **A1**              | (-1, 1) | (1, -1) |

So:
- If both play A0: you (Player 2) get 1
- If Player 1 plays A0, you play A1: you get -1
- If Player 1 plays A1, you play A0: you get -1
- If both play A1: you get 1

---

### **Step 2: Identify the Game Type**

This is a **zero-sum game** because for every outcome, the sum of payoffs is 0:
- (1, -1): sum = 0
- (-1, 1): sum = 0
- Similarly for others.

So, maximizing your points is equivalent to minimizing the opponent's points.

---

### **Step 3: Find the Nash Equilibrium**

In a zero-sum game, the Nash equilibrium can be found using the minimax theorem.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ be the probability that Player 1 plays A0.
- Let $ q $ be the probability that **you (Player 2)** play A0.

We want to find your optimal strategy (i.e., $ q $) that maximizes your minimum expected payoff, regardless of what Player 1 does.

But since this is symmetric, let's check if the game has a symmetric Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ p $, and Player 2 (you) plays A0 with probability $ q $.

Your expected payoff if you play A0:
- With prob $ p $: Player 1 plays A0 → you get 1
- With prob $ 1-p $: Player 1 plays A1 → you get -1
→ Expected payoff = $ 1 \cdot p + (-1) \cdot (1 - p) = p - (1 - p) = 2p - 1 $

Your expected payoff if you play A1:
- With prob $ p $: Player 1 plays A0 → you get -1
- With prob $ 1-p $: Player 1 plays A1 → you get 1
→ Expected payoff = $ -1 \cdot p + 1 \cdot (1 - p) = -p + 1 - p = 1 - 2p $

You are indifferent when:
$ 2p - 1 = 1 - 2p $

Solve:
$ 2p - 1 = 1 - 2p $
$ 4p = 2 $
$ p = 0.5 $

So if Player 1 plays A0 with 50%, you are indifferent between A0 and A1. Therefore, the best response for you is to play any mixture — but to **make Player 1 indifferent**, you need to choose $ q $ such that Player 1 has no incentive to deviate.

Now, let’s reverse the roles.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
If Player 1 plays A0:
- You (Player 2) play A0 with prob $ q $ → payoff: -1
- You play A1 with prob $ 1 - q $ → payoff: 1
→ Expected: $ -1 \cdot q + 1 \cdot (1 - q) = -q + 1 - q = 1 - 2q $

If Player 1 plays A1:
- You play A0 with prob $ q $ → payoff: 1
- You play A1 with prob $ 1 - q $ → payoff: -1
→ Expected: $ 1 \cdot q + (-1) \cdot (1 - q) = q - 1 + q = 2q - 1 $

Player 1 is indifferent when:
$ 1 - 2q = 2q - 1 $
$ 1 + 1 = 4q $
$ 2 = 4q $
$ q = 0.5 $

So, the **unique Nash equilibrium** is:
- Player 1 plays A0 with 50%
- You (Player 2) play A0 with 50%

This is a **symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 4: Optimal Strategy for You (Player 2)**

Since we’re playing in a zero-sum game and the Nash equilibrium is symmetric, the optimal way to maximize your expected points — regardless of what the other player does, assuming rational play — is to **play A0 with 50% and A1 with 50%**.

This ensures:
- You get an expected payoff of 0, no matter what the other player does (since the game is symmetric and zero-sum).
- But crucially, you **cannot be exploited** — any deviation from this by the opponent will not improve their payoff if you stick to 50-50.

Thus, **50-50 is the optimal strategy**.

---

### **Step 5: Final Answer Format**

We need to output a JSON object with:
- Keys: "A0" and "A1"
- Values: integers (percentage points)
- Sum must be 100

So:
- "A0": 50
- "A1": 50

---

response:
To maximize points in this zero-sum game, we must identify the optimal strategy. The described game is a version of "Matching Pennies," where one player (Player 2, in this case) receives points for matching the other player's action, while the other player (Player 1) receives points for choosing a different action.

Here is the payoff matrix for Player 2 (your perspective):
- **(A0, A0):** 1 point
- **(A0, A1):** -1 point
- **(A1, A0):** -1 point
- **(A1, A1):** 1 point

In this game, if Player 2 is predictable, Player 1 can exploit that knowledge. For example, if you choose A0 with 100% probability, Player 1 would choose A1 to ensure you get -1 and they get 1. Conversely, if you choose A1 with 100% probability, Player 1 would choose A0.

The Nash equilibrium for a zero-sum game like Matching Pennies is for both players to play each action with an equal probability of 0.5 (or 50%). By choosing a 50/50 distribution, you ensure that your expected payoff remains 0 regardless of the strategy chosen by the other player. In a one-shot game or when playing against an unknown opponent, this strategy is the most robust as it prevents exploitation.

1.  **Analyze payoffs:** You win if actions match; the opponent wins if they differ.
2.  **Identify Game Type:** This is a zero-sum game (specifically "Matching Pennies").
3.  **Determine Strategy:** The Nash equilibrium is to randomize choices to prevent predictability.
4.  **Calculate Probabilities:** 50% for A0 and 50% for A1.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure

From my perspective as Player 2:
- (Me: A0, Opponent: A0) → I get **1** point
- (Me: A0, Opponent: A1) → I get **-1** point  
- (Me: A1, Opponent: A0) → I get **-1** point
- (Me: A1, Opponent: A1) → I get **1** point

## Step 2: Recognize the Game Type

This is a **matching pennies** game - I want to match my opponent's action to get positive payoff (+1), and I lose when we mismatch (-1).

## Step 3: Analyze Expected Payoffs

If opponent plays A0 with probability *p* and A1 with probability *(1-p)*:

**My expected payoff from A0:**
- E[A0] = p(1) + (1-p)(-1) = 2p - 1

**My expected payoff from A1:**
- E[A1] = p(-1) + (1-p)(1) = 1 - 2p

## Step 4: Find the Nash Equilibrium

In a zero-sum game like this, I should choose a strategy that makes my opponent indifferent, preventing them from exploiting me.

Setting my strategies equal (to be indifferent when opponent plays optimally):
- 2p - 1 = 1 - 2p
- 4p = 2
- p = 0.5

The Nash equilibrium is for the opponent to play each action with 50% probability. By symmetry of this game, I should also play each action with 50% probability.

## Step 5: Verify This is Optimal

At 50-50:
- My expected payoff = 0 (guaranteed, regardless of opponent's strategy)
- Any deviation allows a rational opponent to exploit me for negative expected value

**Conclusion:** The optimal strategy is to randomize equally between both actions.

response:
The game described is a classic zero-sum game known as "Matching Pennies." In this game, Player 1 (you) receives a point if both players choose the same action (A0, A0 or A1, A1), and the other player receives a point if the actions differ (A0, A1 or A1, A0).

To analyze this payoff structure, we look for a strategy that maximizes your expected points regardless of the other player's decision. This is known as the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1.  **Define the Payoff Matrix for Player 1:**
    *   (A0, A0): +1
    *   (A0, A1): -1
    *   (A1, A0): -1
    *   (A1, A1): +1

2.  **Calculate Expected Value ($EV$):**
    Let $p$ be the probability that you choose A0, and $q$ be the probability that the other player chooses A0.
    $EV = p[q(1) + (1-q)(-1)] + (1-p)[q(-1) + (1-q)(1)]$
    $EV = p(2q - 1) + (1-p)(1 - 2q)$
    $EV = 2pq - p + 1 - 2q - p + 2pq$
    $EV = 4pq - 2p - 2q + 1$
    This can be factored as $EV = (2p - 1)(2q - 1)$.

3.  **Find the Nash Equilibrium:**
    Your goal is to choose a probability $p$ such that your expected payoff is maximized or at least stable against an opponent. If you choose $p = 0.5$ (50%), then $(2(0.5) - 1) = 0$. In this case, $EV = 0 \times (2q - 1) = 0$.
    Regardless of what your opponent does ($q$), your expected payoff remains 0. If you choose any other value (e.g., $p = 0.6$), a rational opponent could then choose $q = 0$ to make your $EV = (1.2 - 1)(0 - 1) = -0.2$.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    The optimal strategy in a simultaneous, zero-sum game like matching pennies is to randomize your choices equally. This prevents the opponent from exploiting any bias in your strategy.

Since the instruction asks for the probability distribution over the available actions as integers summing to 100, the best strategy is a 50/50 split.

To tackle this decision-making game, let's carefully analyze the payoff matrix and the potential strategies.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Objective**:
   - **My Objective**: To maximize my total points.
   - **Payoff Matrix for Player 2 (Me)**:
     - (A0, A0): I get 1 point.
     - (A0, A1): I get -1 point.
     - (A1, A0): I get -1 point.
     - (A1, A1): I get 1 point.

2. **Structure Analysis**:
   - The payoffs are symmetric and alternate between 1 point and -1 point, such that:
     - When both players choose the same action, I gain 1 point.
     - When we choose different actions, I lose 1 point.
     
3. **Mixed Strategy**:
   - We need to choose probabilities for actions A0 and A1 to maximize expected points.
   - If both players choose purely one action (e.g., always A0 or always A1), the other player can easily exploit this by choosing the complementary action.
   - A mixed strategy where actions are chosen probabilistically can prevent the other player from easily predicting and countering our moves.
   
4. **Finding Optimal Probabilities**:
   - Let's assume Player 1 is also rational and they try to randomize their choices to avoid being predictable.
   - Therefore, an optimal mixed strategy for me would be to choose each action with equal probability to make my choices unpredictable.

### Expected Payoff Calculation:
- If I choose A0 with probability 50% and A1 with probability 50%, then:
  - My expected payoff if I play A0 against Player 1's expected mix of actions:
    - \( E(\text{A0}) = 0.5 \times 1 (\text{when P1 chooses A0}) + 0.5 \times (-1) (\text{when P1 chooses A1}) = 0 \)
  - My expected payoff if I play A1 against Player 1's expected mix of actions:
    - \( E(\text{A1}) = 0.5 \times (-1) (\text{when P1 chooses A0}) + 0.5 \times 1 (\text{when P1 chooses A1}) = 0 \)
  - Since both actions give me an expected payoff of 0, randomizing equally between them neutralizes any advantage or disadvantage.

### Final Decision:
- To remain unpredictable and avoid exploitation, I will choose each action with a probability of 50%.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
  "A0": 50,
  "A1": 50
}
```

In this game, by choosing 50% probability for both actions, we ensure an equilibrium where neither player can improve their expected payoff by deviating unilaterally.

In this game, Player 2 goals are to "match" the action chosen by Player 1. If both players select A0 or both select A1, Player 2 receives 1 point and Player 1 receives -1 point. If one player selects A0 and the other selects A1, Player 2 receives -1 point and Player 1 receives 1 point. This setup is a classic zero-sum game known as "Matching Pennies."

In a zero-sum game, the objective is to find a strategy that maximizes your minimum expected payoff regardless of the other player's strategy. This is found at the Nash Equilibrium. 

1.  **Analyze the Payoff Matrix for Player 2 (Me):**
    *   (Me: A0, Other: A0) -> Me: 1
    *   (Me: A0, Other: A1) -> Me: -1
    *   (Me: A1, Other: A0) -> Me: -1
    *   (Me: A1, Other: A1) -> Me: 1

2.  **Find the Nash Equilibrium:**
    *   Let $p$ be the probability that I (Player 2) choose A0.
    *   If the other player chooses A0, my expected payoff is: $1(p) + (-1)(1-p) = 2p - 1$.
    *   If the other player chooses A1, my expected payoff is: $(-1)(p) + 1(1-p) = 1 - 2p$.
    *   The minimax strategy occurs when these two expected payoffs are equal: $2p - 1 = 1 - 2p \Rightarrow 4p = 2 \Rightarrow p = 0.5$.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    By choosing A0 with 50% probability and A1 with 50% probability, I ensure an expected payoff of 0 regardless of what the other player does. Deviating from this 50/50 strategy would allow an intelligent opponent to exploit my strategy and reduce my expected points below 0. In the absence of any information about the other player's tendencies, the 50/50 mixed strategy is the most robust and rational choice.

In this game, Player 2 is assigned the goal of matching Player 1's action to receive a positive payoff. The payoff matrix for Player 2 is:
- If (Player 2: A0, Player 1: A0), Player 2 gets 1 point.
- If (Player 2: A0, Player 1: A1), Player 2 gets -1 point.
- If (Player 2: A1, Player 1: A0), Player 2 gets -1 point.
- If (Player 2: A1, Player 1: A1), Player 2 gets 1 point.

Conversely, Player 1 receives the opposite payoffs:
- If (Player 1: A0, Player 2: A0), Player 1 gets -1 point.
- If (Player 1: A0, Player 2: A1), Player 1 gets 1 point.
- If (Player 1: A1, Player 2: A0), Player 1 gets 1 point.
- If (Player 1: A1, Player 2: A1), Player 1 gets -1 point.

This is a classic zero-sum game known as "Matching Pennies." In this game, one player (Player 2) wants to match the other player's choice, while the other player (Player 1) wants to mismatch. Because the interests are perfectly opposed and the payoffs are symmetrical, there is no stable pure strategy (no single action is always optimal).

The Nash Equilibrium for this game is reaching a mixed strategy where each player chooses their actions with equal probability. By choosing A0 and A1 each with a 50% probability, a player ensures that their expected payoff is 0 regardless of the other player's choice, and they prevent the other player from being able to exploit their strategy.

Reasoning through the payoff for Player 2:
- If I choose A0 with probability $p$ and Player 1 chooses A0 with probability $q$, my expected payoff is $E = p \cdot q(1) + p \cdot (1-q)(-1) + (1-p) \cdot q(-1) + (1-p) \cdot (1-q)(1)$.
- Simplifying this gives $E = 4pq - 2p - 2q + 1$.
- If Player 1 chooses $q = 0.5$, then $E = 4p(0.5) - 2p - 2(0.5) + 1 = 2p - 2p - 1 + 1 = 0$.
- My expected payoff becomes 0 regardless of the value of $p$ I choose.
- To protect myself from being exploited by a rational opponent, I should also set $p = 0.5$.

Thus, the optimal distribution is a 50% chance for each action.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff structure

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoffs are:
- I choose A0, opponent chooses A0: I get **1** point
- I choose A0, opponent chooses A1: I get **-1** point
- I choose A1, opponent chooses A0: I get **-1** point
- I choose A1, opponent chooses A1: I get **1** point

## Step 2: Recognize the game type

This is a "matching pennies" style game where:
- I want to **match** the opponent's action (same choice → I get +1)
- The opponent wants to **anti-match** my action (different choices → they get +1)

This is a zero-sum game (my gain = opponent's loss).

## Step 3: Find the Nash equilibrium

Let me calculate what probability distribution makes the opponent indifferent:

If I play A0 with probability p:
- Opponent's expected payoff from A0: -p + (1-p) = 1 - 2p
- Opponent's expected payoff from A1: p - (1-p) = 2p - 1

Setting these equal (indifference condition):
1 - 2p = 2p - 1
4p = 2
**p = 0.5**

Similarly, I can verify this makes me indifferent to the opponent's strategy.

## Step 4: Conclusion

The Nash equilibrium is a **50-50 mixed strategy**. This ensures:
- The opponent cannot exploit my strategy
- I maximize my minimum expected payoff (maximin strategy)
- Expected payoff = 0 at equilibrium (fair game)

Let's analyze this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the game structure

This is a two-player simultaneous-move game with the following actions:
- Each player chooses between A0 and A1.
- Each player selects a **probability distribution** over these actions (mixed strategy).
- The outcome is determined randomly according to the joint probabilities.
- Both players receive payoffs based on the actual outcome, as defined.

You are **Player 2**, and the payoffs depend on your action and the other player's action.

Let’s write down the payoff matrix from **Player 2’s perspective**:

|          | Other Player: A0 | Other Player: A1 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| You: A0  | 1                | -1               |
| You: A1  | -1               | 1                |

So from **your** point of view (Player 2), the payoffs are:

- (A0, A0): +1
- (A0, A1): -1
- (A1, A0): -1
- (A1, A1): +1

Now, notice that this is a **symmetric zero-sum game**, with payoffs that are **anti-symmetric**:
- If you gain 1, the other player loses 1, and vice versa.
- The sum of payoffs in every outcome is 0.

This is a **zero-sum game**.

### Step 2: Is this a coordination or anti-coordination game?

Let’s look at incentive structure:

- If you play A0 and the other player plays A0 → you get +1
- If you play A0 and the other player plays A1 → you get -1
- Similarly, if you play A1 and the other plays A0 → -1
- If both play A1 → +1

So you get +1 **only when both choose the same action** (A0-A0 or A1-A1).

You get -1 when the actions differ.

→ This is an **anti-coordination** game (you want to match only if it gives you +1, but in this case, you get +1 only when both match).

Wait! Let's double-check:
- (A0, A0) → you get 1 → good
- (A0, A1) → you get -1 → bad
- (A1, A0) → you get -1 → bad
- (A1, A1) → you get 1 → good

So, you get **+1 when both players choose the same action**, and **-1 when they choose different actions**.

So actually, this is a **coordination game** with a twist: both players want to **match** each other.

But in this case, the **payoff structure is symmetric**: both players get +1 if they coordinate, -1 if they don't.

Wait — look back at the original payoff description:

> - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 1 points, the other player gets -1 points.

Hold on: that means **you get +1**, **the other gets -1**.

But in the case:
> - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 point, the other player gets -1 point.

So in **all cases where you both choose the same action**, you get +1, the other gets -1.

When you choose differently, you get -1, the other gets +1.

So the **total payoff is always 0**.

This is a **zero-sum game**, and the payoff is:

- +1 if both choose same action
- -1 if they choose different actions

But from **your** perspective:
- You get +1 when you match the other player’s choice.
- You get -1 when you mismatch.

So you want to **match the other player**.

But the other player wants to match you too, since for them, matching also gives them +1.

Wait — this is **not symmetric** in payoffs?

Wait — let’s re-express the full game.

From **Player 2 (you)**:
- (A0, A0): you get +1
- (A0, A1): you get -1
- (A1, A0): you get -1
- (A1, A1): you get +1

From **Player 1 (other player)**:
- (A0, A0): -1
- (A0, A1): +1
- (A1, A0): +1
- (A1, A1): -1

So:
- Player 1 gets -1 if both choose A0, +1 if they differ
- Player 1 gets -1 if both choose A1, +1 if they differ
→ So Player 1 gets +1 if they **differ**, -1 if they **match**.

Ah! So this is not symmetric!

Wait, this is crucial.

Let’s tabulate both players’ payoffs:

| Your choice | Other’s choice | Your payoff | Other’s payoff |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| A0          | A0             | +1          | -1             |
| A0          | A1             | -1          | +1             |
| A1          | A0             | -1          | +1             |
| A1          | A1             | +1          | -1             |

So:
- **You** get +1 if you match the other player’s choice.
- **Other player** gets +1 if they **do not match** your choice.

So your goal is to **match** the other player.
Their goal is to **differ** from you.

This is a **zero-sum game**, and it is a **mismatching game from the other player’s perspective**, but a **matching game from your perspective**.

So it's a **zero-sum game where you want to coordinate, and the other player wants to anti-coordinate**.

This is a classic **"Matching Pennies"** type game, except with a twist:

In standard Matching Pennies:
- Player 1 wins if matches
- Player 2 wins if mismatches
- Payoffs are symmetric in zero-sum.

But here, **you** want to **match**, and **the other player wants to mismatch**.

So, from **your** perspective, this is:

- You want to choose the same as the other player.
- They want to choose differently from you.

Yes, this is **identical to standard Matching Pennies**, where you are the "match" player and they are the "mismatch" player.

### Step 3: Find the optimal mixed strategy

In zero-sum games, the optimal strategy for each player is a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ be the probability that **you** play A0.
- Let $ q $ be the probability that the **other player** plays A0.

Your expected payoff, given your strategy and the other’s, is:
- With probability $ q $: other plays A0
  - You play A0 with prob $ p $: you get +1
  - You play A1 with prob $ 1 - p $: you get -1
  → So expected payoff when other plays A0: $ p(1) + (1-p)(-1) = p - (1 - p) = 2p - 1 $

- With probability $ 1 - q $: other plays A1
  - You play A0: get -1
  - You play A1: get +1
  → Expected payoff: $ p(-1) + (1-p)(1) = -p + 1 - p = 1 - 2p $

So your total expected payoff:
$$
E = q(2p - 1) + (1 - q)(1 - 2p)
$$

Simplify:
$$
E = q(2p - 1) + (1 - q)(1 - 2p)
= q(2p - 1) + (1 - 2p) - q(1 - 2p)
= q[ (2p - 1) - (1 - 2p) ] + (1 - 2p)
= q[2p - 1 - 1 + 2p] + (1 - 2p)
= q(4p - 2) + (1 - 2p)
$$

Now, since this is a zero-sum game, the **other player** chooses $ q $ to **minimize your expected payoff**, and **you** choose $ p $ to **maximize** your expected payoff **against their worst-case $ q $**.

So you want to choose $ p $ to maximize the **minimum** expected payoff over $ q $.

But in a zero-sum game, the optimal strategy is to make the opponent indifferent between their choices.

So, what should you do?

Let’s find the mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability $ p $, A1 with $ 1 - p $.

The other player wants to **minimize your expected payoff**.

But since they are rational, they will choose $ q $ to minimize your payoff **given $ p $**, and you want to pick $ p $ so that **no matter what $ q $** they choose, your payoff is maximized **in expectation against their best response**.

But in equilibrium, both players play strategies that make the other indifferent.

Let’s find what $ p $ makes the **other player indifferent** between choosing A0 and A1?

Wait — no: from the **other player’s point of view**, they are trying to **minimize your payoff**.

So they will choose $ q $ to minimize your expected payoff.

But under optimal play, you should choose $ p $ so that **your choice makes the other player indifferent between playing A0 and A1** — because otherwise, they’d play only one.

So let’s compute your **expected payoff** if the other player plays A0: $ 2p - 1 $

If the other player plays A1: $ 1 - 2p $

So the other player, wanting to **minimize** your expected payoff, will choose:
- A0 if $ 2p - 1 < 1 - 2p $ → $ 4p < 2 $ → $ p < 0.5 $
- A1 if $ 2p - 1 > 1 - 2p $ → $ 4p > 2 $ → $ p > 0.5 $
- Indifferent if $ p = 0.5 $

At $ p = 0.5 $, your expected payoff is:
- If they play A0: $ 2*(0.5) - 1 = 0 $
- If they play A1: $ 1 - 2*(0.5) = 0 $

So regardless of what they do, your expected payoff is 0.

Now, suppose you play $ p \neq 0.5 $, say $ p > 0.5 $:
- Then $ 2p - 1 > 0 $, $ 1 - 2p < 0 $
- So your payoff is higher if they play A0, lower if they play A1
- So they will choose to play A1 to minimize your payoff → you get $ 1 - 2p < 0 $
- So worst outcome.

Similarly, if $ p < 0.5 $, they play A0 → you get $ 2p - 1 < 0 $

So only when $ p = 0.5 $, your expected payoff is **0** regardless of their strategy.

Thus, the **minimax** strategy for you is to play $ p = 0.5 $.

And at that point, **no matter what the other player does**, your expected payoff is 0.

Any deviation from $ p = 0.5 $ allows the other player to make your expected payoff negative.

Therefore, the optimal strategy for you is to choose **A0 with 50% probability, A1 with 50%**.

This is the **unique Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

### Step 4: Final answer

You are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.

You must output:
- A JSON object
- Keys: "A0", "A1"
- Values: integers (percentage points)
- Sum = 100

So:

{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure

From my perspective (Player 2):
- If opponent plays A0: I get 1 from A0, -1 from A1 → A0 is better
- If opponent plays A1: I get -1 from A0, 1 from A1 → A1 is better

So I want to **match** whatever the opponent plays.

From the opponent's perspective (Player 1):
- If I play A0: They get -1 from A0, 1 from A1 → A1 is better  
- If I play A1: They get 1 from A0, -1 from A1 → A0 is better

So they want to **mismatch** whatever I play.

## Step 2: Recognize the Game Type

This is a zero-sum game where our interests are opposed:
- I prefer coordination (matching actions)
- They prefer anti-coordination (mismatching actions)

## Step 3: Find the Nash Equilibrium

Let me find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let opponent play A0 with probability p. For me to be indifferent:
- Expected value from A0: p(1) + (1-p)(-1) = 2p - 1
- Expected value from A1: p(-1) + (1-p)(1) = 1 - 2p

Setting equal: 2p - 1 = 1 - 2p → p = 0.5

Let me play A0 with probability q. For opponent to be indifferent:
- Their EV from A0: q(-1) + (1-q)(1) = 1 - 2q
- Their EV from A1: q(1) + (1-q)(-1) = 2q - 1

Setting equal: 1 - 2q = 2q - 1 → q = 0.5

## Step 4: Conclusion

The Nash equilibrium is for both players to mix 50-50. This:
- Prevents exploitation (any pure strategy gives me -1 expected value)
- Gives expected payoff of 0 (cannot be improved against a rational opponent)
- Is the safest strategy in a simultaneous-move game

response:
To maximize our total points, let's break down the problem:

1. **Payoff Analysis**:
    - If both choose A0: I get 1, the other player gets -1.
    - If I choose A0 and the other chooses A1: I get -1, the other player gets 1.
    - If I choose A1 and the other chooses A0: I get -1, the other player gets 1.
    - If both choose A1: I get 1, the other player gets -1.

From the payoff matrix, it's clear the game is symmetrical and zero-sum: my gain is the other player's loss and vice versa.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
    - Because this game is zero-sum and symmetrical, there’s no pure strategy that guarantees me the highest payoff in every round.
    - If I always choose one action (A0 or A1), the other player can always choose the action that minimizes my points.
    - Therefore, the best strategy in such a game is often to adopt a mixed strategy, which means randomizing my choices to prevent the other player from predicting and exploiting my choices.

3. **Choosing the Probability Distribution**:
    - To make my choice unpredictable, I should equally randomize between A0 and A1.
    - This will ensure that the other player does not have a clear advantage by predicting my actions.

4. **Final Decision**:
    - Set the probability of choosing A0 and A1 to 50% each.

Now, let’s format this into a valid JSON object:

```json
{
  "A0": 50,
  "A1": 50
}
```

This approach ensures the best chance of maximizing my total points over multiple rounds by preventing the other player from easily predicting and countering my actions.

response:
To maximize my total points received, I need to consider both the payoffs and the likelihood of the other player's actions. Let's break down the problem in a step-by-step manner to arrive at the optimal strategy.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Payoffs:**
    - Choosing A0 and the other player choosing A0 (A0, A0): I get 1 point, the other player gets -1 points.
    - Choosing A0 and the other player choosing A1 (A0, A1): I get -1 points, the other player gets 1 point.
    - Choosing A1 and the other player choosing A0 (A1, A0): I get -1 points, the other player gets 1 point.
    - Choosing A1 and the other player choosing A1 (A1, A1): I get 1 point, the other player gets -1 points.

2. **Symmetrical Payoff Structure:**
    - Notice that the payoffs are symmetrical for both players but are opposing.

3. **Expectation of Rationality:**
    - If both players are rational and aim to maximize their own points, they will understand that their opponent is also aiming to maximize their points.

4. **Minimax Strategy in Zero-Sum Games:**
    - This game can be viewed as a zero-sum game where one's gain is another's loss.
    - In such games, a common optimal strategy is to randomize actions to make the opponent indifferent.

5. **Equalizing Expected Payoffs:**
    - To ensure the opponent cannot predict and exploit our choice, we should choose each action with equal probability.

### Conclusion:
Given the payoffs are symmetrical and opposing, and with the goal of maximizing our own points while minimizing predictability, the optimal strategy is to randomize our actions. The best way to do this is by choosing each action with equal probability.

Thus, we set the probability distribution to:
- 50% for A0
- 50% for A1

response:
To determine the optimal probability distribution for the actions A0 and A1, we need to analyze the game's structure and consider various strategies. We'll do this by examining the payoffs and identifying a strategy that would best maximize our total points.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Payoffs**:
   - If both players choose A0: Player 1 gets 1 point, Player 2 gets -1 point.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets -1 point, Player 2 gets 1 point.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets -1 point, Player 2 gets 1 point.
   - If both players choose A1: Player 1 gets 1 point, Player 2 gets -1 point.

2. **Payoff Matrix**:
   - Player 1's payoffs:
     - (A0, A0) = 1 point
     - (A0, A1) = -1 point
     - (A1, A0) = -1 point
     - (A1, A1) = 1 point

3. **Symmetry Observation**:
   The payoffs are symmetric and mirror each other for both players. It indicates that both players are in a zero-sum game situation. The best strategy requiring us to potentially randomize our choices to prevent the opponent from always exploiting a predictable pattern.

4. **Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**:
   In a zero-sum game like this with symmetric payoffs, the Nash Equilibrium often results in each player choosing actions with equal probability. This is because randomizing makes the expected payoff equal regardless of the opponent's action, thus preventing exploitation.

5. **Equal Probability Strategy**:
   By choosing each action (A0 and A1) with equal probability, we mitigate the risk of the opponent consistently predicting and countering our choice.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the optimal strategy to maximize our total points would be to choose each action (A0 and A1) with equal probability.

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "A0": 50,
  "A1": 50
}
```
This even distribution ensures that our choices are unpredictable, balancing our risks given the zero-sum nature of the game.

### Understanding the Game

#### Objective:
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game.

#### Actions and Outcomes:
1. **If you choose A0**:
   - Other chooses A0: You get 1 point, Other gets -1 point
   - Other chooses A1: You get -1 point, Other gets 1 point

2. **If you choose A1**:
   - Other chooses A0: You get -1 point, Other gets 1 point
   - Other chooses A1: You get 1 point, Other gets -1 point

#### Analysis:
- The payoffs in this game resemble a zero-sum game, meaning your gain is exactly the other player's loss and vice versa.
- Both players will attempt to maximize their own utility. If the other player acts rationally, they will try to anticipate your strategy and act accordingly.

### Strategy
- If you consistently choose A0 or A1, the other player can predict this and exploit it.
- To avoid exploitation, a mixed strategy is preferable where you randomize your actions, making it harder for the other player to predict your choice. 

### Optimal Probability Distribution
- This situation resembles the classic game theory problem where randomizing between choices equally (given symmetric outcomes) is usually a good approach to prevent exploitation.

Therefore, you should choose both A0 and A1 with equal probability.

### Final Decision

To address this game, it's important to carefully consider the payoff structure and how to maximize our points. Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**
   - If both players choose A0, Player 1 gets 1 point, and Player 2 gets -1 point.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets -1 point, and Player 2 gets 1 point.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets -1 point, and Player 2 gets 1 point.
   - If both players choose A1, Player 1 gets 1 point, and Player 2 gets -1 point.

2. **Analyze Symmetry:**
   - The game is symmetric, suggesting that the same strategy is likely optimal for both players if aiming to maximize their own outcome.

3. **Probability Distribution and Expected Payoff:**
   - If both players choose A0 with 50% probability and A1 with 50% probability, let's calculate expected payoff:
     - The probability that both players choose A0: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 -> Expected payoff for Player 1: 0.25 * 1 = 0.25
     - The probability that Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 -> Expected payoff for Player 1: 0.25 * (-1) = -0.25
     - The probability that Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 -> Expected payoff for Player 1: 0.25 * (-1) = -0.25
     - The probability that both players choose A1: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 -> Expected payoff for Player 1: 0.25 * 1 = 0.25

   Summing these up:
   Expected payoff for Player 1:
   ```
   0.25 * 1 + 0.25 * (-1) + 0.25 * (-1) + 0.25 * 1 = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0
   ```

4. **Optimal Mixed Strategy:**
   - If the probabilities for A0 and A1 are equal (50% each), the expected payoff for choosing A0 or A1 are both equal given that the other player is choosing each action with equal probability.
   - This method ensures that we do not give the opponent an edge, as they could also reason similarly.

Given these steps, the optimal decision is to choose each action with equal probability. Here is the resulting JSON object:

```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

response:
To solve this decision-making problem, we need to consider the strategies for maximizing our points while considering the corresponding penalties and rewards based on our opponent's actions.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix**:
    - If both players choose \( A0 \):
        - Player 1 gets 1 point.
        - Player 2 gets -1 point.
    - If Player 1 chooses \( A0 \) and Player 2 chooses \( A1 \):
        - Player 1 gets -1 point.
        - Player 2 gets 1 point.
    - If Player 1 chooses \( A1 \) and Player 2 chooses \( A0 \):
        - Player 1 gets -1 point.
        - Player 2 gets 1 point.
    - If both players choose \( A1 \):
        - Player 1 gets 1 point.
        - Player 2 gets -1 point.

2. **Analysis of Symmetry**:
    - The game is symmetric with regards to both players' actions.
    - Both \( A0 \) and \( A1 \) result in the same pattern of outcomes, with the roles reversed. This implies that the game is zero-sum; one player’s gain is the other player’s loss.

3. **Identification of Dominant Strategy**:
    - No single strategy can guarantee a win every time, since the points highly depend on the choices of the opponent.
    - However, to ensure that we stay neutral with potential random distributions, neither \( A0 \) nor \( A1 \) has a dominant strategy.

4. **Mixed Strategy Approach**:
    - Given that we cannot predict the opponent's choice and an equal probability distribution might balance outcomes.
    - Pick equal probability for \( A0 \) and \( A1 \) to avoid consistent losses or gains, allowing for an expected neutral position.

### Conclusion
A mixed strategy with equal probabilities maximizes stability and reduces the chance of consistent losses or negative outcomes over many rounds.

### Final Answer

Given the analysis and reasoning, the optimal probability distribution should be:
```json
{
    "A0": 50,
    "A1": 50
}
```

response:
To address the given scenario comprehensively and strategically, we need to analyze the potential outcomes and optimal strategies in this game. The game's pay-off matrix can be summarized as follows:

| Choices  | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Your A0  | 1, -1           | -1, 1           |
| Your A1  | -1, 1           | 1, -1           |

Interestingly, the game is a zero-sum game where both players get symmetric but opposite payoffs. When analyzing from a game theory perspective, specifically focusing on mixed strategies, we could consider the following:

### Analyzing Strategies:
1. **Pure Strategies:** 
    - If you always choose A0 or always choose A1, you'll get opposing payoffs if the other player chooses either action.
    - Consistently choosing a single action makes you too predictable.

2. **Mixed Strategies:**
    - Randomizing will make you less predictable.
    - The goal is to choose probabilities for each action such that the other player cannot exploit your choice to their advantage.

In a mixed strategy equilibrium for a zero-sum game, we generally need to equalize the expected payoffs from each action. Both expected payoffs should be the same, which would push the opponent into making their choices probabilistically as well.

### Calculative Approach:
- Let's denote the probability of choosing A0 as p, and the probability of choosing A1 as 1 - p.
- Expected payoff if choosing A0: 
  \[
  E(A0) = p \cdot 1 + (1 - p) \cdot (-1)
  \]
- Expected payoff if choosing A1: 
  \[
  E(A1) = p \cdot (-1) + (1 - p) \cdot 1
  \]

Setting these two equal ensures our opponent cannot exploit either choice:
\[
p \cdot 1 + (1 - p) \cdot (-1) = p \cdot (-1) + (1 - p) \cdot 1
\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[
p - 1 + p = -p + 1 - p
\]
\[
2p - 1 = -2p + 1
\]
\[
4p = 2
\]
\[
p = 0.5
\]

Thus, the optimal mixed strategy here would be to assign equal probabilities (50%) to both A0 and A1.

### Conclusion:
To minimize the predictability and to ensure the best strategy in this zero-sum context, we should randomize our actions evenly.

Given the above calculation and reasoning, the recommended strategy is:

```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

This balances the payoffs and makes it harder for the opponent to predict and exploit your choices, thus maximizing your expected points over time.

To maximize expected points in this zero-sum “matching” game, notice:

1. Your payoff is **+1 when actions match** (A0/A0 or A1/A1) and **-1 when they differ**.  
2. If you put more weight on one action (say A0), the other player can exploit that by favoring the opposite action to make mismatches more likely.  
3. The only strategy that cannot be exploited is to make the other player indifferent between their choices: **mix evenly**.

So the optimal distribution is:

response:
To approach this game, let's break down the decision-making process step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Payoffs
Looking at the payoffs:
- If both players choose A0, I get 1 point and the other player gets -1 point.
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, I get -1 point and the other player gets 1 point.
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, I get -1 point and the other player gets 1 point.
- If both players choose A1, I get 1 point and the other player gets -1 point.

### Step 2: Identify Dominant Strategy
A dominant strategy is an action that yields a higher payoff regardless of what the opponent does. Here we can see:
- Choosing A0 when the opponent chooses A0 gives me 1 point, while choosing A1 would also give me 1 point.
- Choosing A0 when the opponent chooses A1 gives me -1 point, while choosing A1 gives me -1 point as well.

So, whether I choose A0 or A1, my payoffs mirror each other depending on the opponent's actions. There isn't a clear dominant strategy for me because the outcomes are symmetrical.

### Step 3: Evaluate Mixed Strategy
Given there is no dominant strategy, a balanced or mixed strategy might be effective. By issuing a probability distribution, I can introduce uncertainty into the other player's decision-making process. By making both actions equally likely, I can ensure that my opponent can't predict my move, thereby maximizing my expected outcome.

### Step 4: Optimal Probability Distribution
If I choose A0 or A1 with the same probability, the opponent cannot exploit my decision easily. Therefore, selecting a 50/50 chance for both actions seems reasonable.

### Step 5: JSON Output
The JSON output should represent this balanced approach. 

Here's the final answer:

```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

This distribution reflects a strategy of indifference, making my choices unpredictable and thereby maintaining an average expected payoff that isn't easily exploitable by the other player.

Let's analyze the game step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix

We are Player 2. The payoff matrix from **Player 2’s** perspective is as follows:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | +1       | -1       |
| **A1**              | -1       | +1       |

But wait – let’s double-check the actual payoffs described in the problem:

- (You choose A0, other chooses A0): you get **1**, other gets **-1**
- (You choose A0, other chooses A1): you get **-1**, other gets **1**
- (You choose A1, other chooses A0): you get **-1**, other gets **1**
- (You choose A1, other chooses A1): you get **1**, other gets **-1**

So from **your** (Player 2’s) point of view:

| Your Action \ Opponent | A0 | A1 |
|------------------------|----|----|
| A0                     | 1  | -1 |
| A1                     | -1 | 1  |

This is a **zero-sum** game (since your points + opponent’s points = 0 in every case), and it's symmetric.

This is actually a **Matching Pennies** game in disguise.

---

### Step 2: Identify the game type and solution concept

This is a classic **zero-sum game** with no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. The only equilibrium is a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

We need to find the probability that each player should randomize to make the other indifferent.

Let:
- Let $ p $ = probability that **you (Player 2)** choose A0.
- Let $ q $ = probability that **the other player (Player 1)** chooses A0.

We are to find the optimal **mixed strategy for Player 2**, such that no matter what the other player does, you can’t improve by deviating — but since this is zero-sum, we want to **maximize your minimum guaranteed expected payoff**.

In a symmetric zero-sum game like this (Matching Pennies), the Nash equilibrium is for **both players** to mix equally: choose A0 with 50%, A1 with 50%.

Let’s verify this.

---

### Step 3: Compute expected payoff

Suppose you play A0 with probability $ p $, A1 with $ 1-p $.

Suppose the other player plays A0 with probability $ q $, A1 with $ 1-q $.

Your expected payoff:

$$
E = p \cdot q \cdot (1) + p \cdot (1-q) \cdot (-1) + (1-p) \cdot q \cdot (-1) + (1-p) \cdot (1-q) \cdot (1)
$$

Simplify:

$$
E = pq - p(1-q) - (1-p)q + (1-p)(1-q)
$$

Expand each term:

- $ pq $
- $ -p + pq $
- $ -q + pq $
- $ 1 - p - q + pq $

Now add them:

$$
E = pq + (-p + pq) + (-q + pq) + (1 - p - q + pq)
$$

Combine like terms:

- Constants: $ 1 $
- $ p $ terms: $ -p - p = -2p $
- $ q $ terms: $ -q - q = -2q $
- $ pq $ terms: $ pq + pq + pq + pq = 4pq $

Wait, that doesn’t seem right. Let’s recompute carefully.

Actually:

$$
E = p q (1) + p (1-q)(-1) + (1-p) q (-1) + (1-p)(1-q)(1)
$$

Break it down:

1. $ pq \cdot 1 = pq $
2. $ p(1-q)(-1) = -p + pq $
3. $ (1-p)q(-1) = -q + pq $
4. $ (1-p)(1-q)(1) = 1 - p - q + pq $

Now sum all:

$$
pq + (-p + pq) + (-q + pq) + (1 - p - q + pq)
$$

Now collect:

- $ pq + pq + pq + pq = 4pq $
- $ -p - p = -2p $
- $ -q - q = -2q $
- +1

So:

$$
E = 4pq - 2p - 2q + 1
$$

To find the optimal $ p $, we want to maximize your minimum expected payoff.

But in zero-sum games, the equilibrium is when you choose $ p $ so that the other player is indifferent between their strategies.

So, let’s find the $ p $ such that the expected payoff is the same regardless of what the opponent plays (i.e., makes opponent indifferent).

Alternatively: fix $ p $, compute opponent’s expected payoff if they play A0 vs A1, and set them equal.

But since the game is symmetric and zero-sum, and both players have symmetric payoffs, the symmetric Nash equilibrium is:

- Each player plays A0 with 50%, A1 with 50%.

Let’s verify: if the other player plays $ q = 0.5 $, what is your best response?

Your expected payoff:

$$
E = 4p(0.5) - 2p - 2(0.5) + 1 = 2p - 2p -1 + 1 = 0
$$

So you get 0 regardless of $ p $. That means **if the opponent plays 50-50**, you’re indifferent between any strategy — so no matter what you do, your expected payoff is 0.

Similarly, if you play $ p = 0.5 $, what is the other player’s best response?

Compute their expected payoff depending on their choice.

Let’s compute the other player’s expected payoff when you play $ p = 0.5 $:

From the payoff table, you get:
- If they play A0: their payoff = $ p \cdot (-1) + (1-p) \cdot 1 = -0.5 + 0.5 = 0 $
- If they play A1: their payoff = $ p \cdot 1 + (1-p) \cdot (-1) = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0 $

So they are also indifferent.

Thus, $ p = 0.5 $, $ q = 0.5 $ is a Nash equilibrium.

And since this is a zero-sum game, the value of the game is 0 — you can guarantee 0 expected payoff by playing 50-50.

Any deviation from this gives the opponent an opportunity to exploit you.

Hence, **the optimal strategy is to play A0 with 50% chance, A1 with 50% chance**.

---

### Step 4: Output in required format

We must output a JSON object with:
- Keys: "A0", "A1"
- Values: integers (percentage points)
- Sum: 100

So:
- A0: 50
- A1: 50

✅ Sum is 100  
✅ Integers  
✅ Correct strategy

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure

Let me organize the payoffs from my perspective (Player 1):

|  | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Me: A0** | +1 | -1 |
| **Me: A1** | -1 | +1 |

I gain points when we **match** actions (both A0 or both A1).

From the other player's perspective:
- They gain points when we **mismatch** actions
- They lose points when we match

### Step 2: Recognize the Game Type

This is a **zero-sum matching pennies game**:
- I want to match the other player's choice
- The other player wants to avoid matching my choice
- There's no pure strategy that dominates

### Step 3: Find the Nash Equilibrium

Let me find what probability distribution makes me unpredictable.

If I play A0 with probability **p**:
- Other player's expected payoff from A0: p(-1) + (1-p)(1) = 1 - 2p
- Other player's expected payoff from A1: p(1) + (1-p)(-1) = 2p - 1

For the other player to be indifferent (required for mixed strategy equilibrium):
1 - 2p = 2p - 1
2 = 4p
**p = 0.5**

Similarly, if the other player plays A0 with probability **q**:
- My expected payoff from A0: q(1) + (1-q)(-1) = 2q - 1
- My expected payoff from A1: q(-1) + (1-q)(1) = 1 - 2q

For me to be indifferent:
2q - 1 = 1 - 2q
4q = 2
**q = 0.5**

### Step 4: Optimal Strategy

The Nash equilibrium is for both players to randomize 50-50. This makes me unexploitable - the other player cannot gain an advantage regardless of their strategy if I play this equilibrium.

response:
To maximize total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff structure. We are playing as Player 2.

The payoffs are relative to our choice (Player 2) and the other player's choice (Player 1):
- (P2: A0, P1: A0): You receive 1, Other receives -1
- (P2: A0, P1: A1): You receive -1, Other receives 1
- (P2: A1, P1: A0): You receive -1, Other receives 1
- (P2: A1, P1: A1): You receive 1, Other receives -1

As Player 2, we want to choose the same action as Player 1 (to "match"). Player 1, meanwhile, wants to choose the opposite action of Player 2 (to "mismatch"). This is a classic zero-sum game known as **Matching Pennies**.

In Matching Pennies, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. If you choose A0 every time, Player 1 will choose A1, and you will lose. If you choose A1 every time, Player 1 will choose A0, and you will lose. The optimal strategy in a competitive environment where your opponent is also attempting to maximize their own score is the **Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**. 

To calculate this equilibrium:
1. Let $q$ be the probability that we (Player 2) choose A0.
2. The expected value for Player 1 if they choose A0 is: $E1(A0) = q(-1) + (1-q)(1) = 1 - 2q$.
3. The expected value for Player 1 if they choose A1 is: $E1(A1) = q(1) + (1-q)(-1) = 2q - 1$.
4. Setting $E1(A0) = E1(A1)$ ensures that Player 1 cannot exploit our strategy: $1 - 2q = 2q - 1 \Rightarrow 4q = 2 \Rightarrow q = 0.5$.

By choosing A0 with 50% probability and A1 with 50% probability, we ensure that our expected payoff is 0 regardless of Player 1's choices, and we make it impossible for them to capitalize on any predictable patterns in our behavior.

The game described is a classic zero-sum game known as "Matching Pennies." In this game, Player 2 (you) wins points by matching the action of Player 1, while Player 1 wins points by choosing a different action than you.

### Payoff Analysis
Looking at the payoffs for you (Player 2):
- **(A0, A0):** You match, you get +1.
- **(A1, A1):** You match, you get +1.
- **(A0, A1):** You mismatch, you get -1.
- **(A1, A0):** You mismatch, you get -1.

Player 1’s payoffs are the exact opposite, meaning their goal is to ensure you do not match their choice.

### Mathematical Strategy
To find the optimal strategy in a zero-sum game, we look for the Nash Equilibrium. Let $q$ be the probability that you choose $A0$ and $p$ be the probability that Player 1 chooses $A0$.

Your expected payoff $E$ is calculated as:
$E = p \cdot q(1) + p \cdot (1-q)(-1) + (1-p) \cdot q(-1) + (1-p) \cdot (1-q)(1)$
$E = pq - p + pq - q - q + pq + 1 - p - q + pq$
$E = 4pq - 2p - 2q + 1$

If you choose $q = 0.5$:
$E = 4p(0.5) - 2p - 2(0.5) + 1$
$E = 2p - 2p - 1 + 1 = 0$

If you play $q = 0.5$ (50% $A0$ and 50% $A1$), your expected payoff is 0 regardless of what Player 1 does. This is the Nash Equilibrium because if either player deviates from this 50/50 strategy, the other player could potentially exploit them to gain an advantage. 

### Conclusion
Given that there is no information about the other player's tendencies or past behavior, the most robust and optimal strategy to maximize points (and minimize potential losses) is to use the Nash Equilibrium strategy.

## Step-by-step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the payoff structure

Let me organize the payoffs from my perspective (Player 1):

|           | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Me: A0**| +1        | -1        |
| **Me: A1**| -1        | +1        |

**Key insight**: I win (+1) when we both choose the same action, and lose (-1) when we choose different actions.

### Step 2: Check for pure strategy equilibrium

- If I always play A0, the other player would prefer A1 (to get +1 instead of -1)
- If I then switch to A1, the other player would prefer A0
- This cycle continues - there's no stable pure strategy

### Step 3: Find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium

Let me denote:
- My probability of playing A0 as p
- Other player's probability of playing A0 as q

**My expected payoff from A0:**
- E[A0] = q(1) + (1-q)(-1) = 2q - 1

**My expected payoff from A1:**
- E[A1] = q(-1) + (1-q)(1) = 1 - 2q

**For the other player to be indifferent (optimal mixed strategy):**
They should make me indifferent between A0 and A1:
- 2q - 1 = 1 - 2q
- 4q = 2
- q = 0.5

**By symmetry of the game**, I should also choose p = 0.5 to make them indifferent.

### Step 4: Verify this is optimal

At 50-50 mixing:
- Expected payoff = 0.5×0.5(1) + 0.5×0.5(-1) + 0.5×0.5(-1) + 0.5×0.5(1) = 0

This is a Nash equilibrium - neither player can improve by deviating unilaterally. Any bias towards one action would allow the opponent to exploit it.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix
From my perspective as Player 2, let me organize the payoffs:

**My Payoffs:**
- I choose A0, Opponent chooses A0: +1
- I choose A0, Opponent chooses A1: -1
- I choose A1, Opponent chooses A0: -1
- I choose A1, Opponent chooses A1: +1

### Step 2: Identifying the Game Type
This is a **matching pennies** game - a classic zero-sum game where:
- I score +1 when both players make the same choice
- I score -1 when we make different choices
- The opponent has exactly opposite payoffs

### Step 3: Finding the Optimal Strategy

Let me denote:
- p = probability I play A0
- q = probability opponent plays A0

**My expected payoff for each action:**
- If I play A0: E[A0] = q(1) + (1-q)(-1) = 2q - 1
- If I play A1: E[A1] = q(-1) + (1-q)(1) = 1 - 2q

**Finding equilibrium:**
For the opponent to play mixed strategy (q = 0.5 in equilibrium), they must be indifferent between their actions given my strategy.

By symmetry of this zero-sum game and solving for the Nash equilibrium:
- Setting 2q - 1 = 1 - 2q gives q = 0.5
- By the same logic, p = 0.5

### Step 4: Conclusion
The optimal strategy in this game is to play each action with **equal probability (50-50)**. This prevents the opponent from exploiting any pattern in my play and guarantees the equilibrium expected value of 0 points.

response:
Let's analyze the game step by step to determine the optimal strategy for **Player 2**, who wants to **maximize their own total points**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

We are given the payoffs for all combinations of actions. Since the problem states that **you are Player 2**, we will frame the payoffs from **Player 2's perspective**.

Let’s write the payoff matrix (Player 2’s payoff first, then Player 1’s):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | (1, -1)  | (-1, 1)  |
| **A1**              | (-1, 1)  | (1, -1)  |

Explanation:
- If both choose A0 → Player 2 gets 1, Player 1 gets -1
- If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1 → Player 2 gets -1, Player 1 gets 1
- If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0 → Player 2 gets -1, Player 1 gets 1
- If both choose A1 → Player 2 gets 1, Player 1 gets -1

---

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Game

This is a **zero-sum game** because the sum of the payoffs in every outcome is zero:
- (1, -1): 1 + (-1) = 0
- (-1, 1): -1 + 1 = 0
- (-1, 1): -1 + 1 = 0
- (1, -1): 1 + (-1) = 0

So, whatever Player 2 gains, Player 1 loses, and vice versa.

---

### Step 3: Find the Nash Equilibrium (or Optimal Mixed Strategy)

Since this is a symmetric zero-sum game, we can use the **minimax theorem** to find the optimal mixed strategy for Player 2.

Let’s suppose:
- Player 2 chooses A0 with probability **p**
- Player 2 chooses A1 with probability **(1 - p)**

Now, assume Player 1 is trying to **minimize Player 2's payoff** (since it's zero-sum), and will play the strategy that gives Player 2 the worst outcome.

But in equilibrium, Player 2 should choose **p** such that **Player 1 is indifferent** between A0 and A1.

Alternatively, to find the optimal mixed strategy, we can compute the **expected payoff** to Player 2 when they play a mixed strategy (p, 1-p), and Player 1 plays a pure strategy.

We can compute Player 2's expected payoff depending on what Player 1 does.

Let:
- Player 1 chooses A0 with probability q
- Player 1 chooses A1 with probability (1 - q)

Then Player 2's expected payoff is:

> E = p*q*(1) + p*(1-q)*(-1) + (1-p)*q*(-1) + (1-p)*(1-q)*(1)

Simplify:
> E = p q - p (1 - q) - (1 - p) q + (1 - p)(1 - q)

Break it down:

1. p q
2. -p + p q
3. -q + p q
4. 1 - p - q + p q

Now sum all:

= p q  
+ (-p + p q)  
+ (-q + p q)  
+ (1 - p - q + p q)

Add term by term:

- Constants: 1
- p terms: -p - p = -2p
- q terms: -q - q = -2q
- pq terms: p q + p q + p q + p q = 4 p q

So:
> E = 1 - 2p - 2q + 4pq

We want to find **p** such that Player 2's expected payoff is maximized regardless of what q Player 1 chooses. But in equilibrium, the optimal strategy is such that **Player 2 makes Player 1 indifferent between A0 and A1**.

So let’s instead assume **Player 2 plays p**, and compute **Player 1’s expected payoff** for choosing A0 vs A1 — but since it's symmetric, we’ll find **p** so that Player 1 cannot gain by deviating.

Actually, let’s do it the standard way: find the mixed strategy for Player 2 that makes Player 1 **indifferent** between A0 and A1.

Let’s fix Player 2’s strategy: choose A0 with probability **p**, A1 with probability **1 - p**

Now, compute Player 1’s expected payoff from choosing A0 vs A1.

But since it’s zero-sum, **Player 1 wants to minimize Player 2’s payoff**.

So let’s compute **Player 2’s expected payoff** if Player 1 chooses A0:

- Player 2 gets:  
  - If Player 2 chooses A0: +1  
  - If Player 2 chooses A1: -1  
  So: E(A0 | p) = p*(1) + (1 - p)*(-1) = p - (1 - p) = 2p - 1

Now, if Player 1 chooses A1:

- Player 2 gets:
  - If Player 2 chooses A0: -1
  - If Player 2 chooses A1: +1
  So: E(A1 | p) = p*(-1) + (1 - p)*(1) = -p + 1 - p = 1 - 2p

Player 1 will choose whichever action gives **Player 2 the lowest expected payoff**.

Player 2 wants to **maximize the minimum** of these two values.

So Player 2 wants to choose p to **maximize**:

> min(2p - 1, 1 - 2p)

Let’s solve when 2p - 1 = 1 - 2p

→ 2p + 2p = 1 + 1  
→ 4p = 2  
→ p = 0.5

So when p = 0.5:
- E(A0) = 2*(0.5) - 1 = 0
- E(A1) = 1 - 2*(0.5) = 0

So both give the same expected payoff: 0

For any p < 0.5, 2p - 1 < 0, and 1 - 2p > 0 → so Player 1 will choose A0 → Player 2 gets 2p - 1 < 0
For any p > 0.5, 2p - 1 > 0, but 1 - 2p < 0 → Player 1 will choose A1 → Player 2 gets 1 - 2p < 0

Only at p = 0.5, both are 0, and Player 1 is indifferent.

Therefore, the optimal strategy for Player 2 is to **randomize equally** between A0 and A1.

This is the **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

---

### Step 4: Verify Against Symmetry and Known Game Types

This game is analogous to **Matching Pennies**, a classic zero-sum game.

In Matching Pennies:
- If both match (A0-A0 or A1-A1), Player 2 wins 1, Player 1 loses 1
- If they mismatch, Player 1 wins 1, Player 2 loses 1

Wait — in our case:
- A0 vs A0 → Player 2 gets 1
- A1 vs A1 → Player 2 gets 1
- A0 vs A1 → Player 2 gets -1
- A1 vs A0 → Player 2 gets -1

So **Player 2 wins when actions match**, loses when they don’t.

This is **exactly Matching Pennies**, with Player 2 being the "matcher".

In Matching Pennies, the **optimal mixed strategy for both players** is to play A0 and A1 each with 50% probability.

Therefore, to maximize their expected payoff (which is 0 in equilibrium), and to prevent the opponent from exploiting them, Player 2 should choose:

- A0: 50%
- A1: 50%

---

### Step 5: Final Answer

We are to output a JSON object with integer percentage points summing to 100.

So:
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}

This is the optimal strategy for Player 2.

Let's break down the requirements and analyze the optimal strategy step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Game Payoff Matrix
The payoff matrix for the actions can be represented as follows (Player 2's payoffs are listed first, then Player 1's payoffs):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0           | A1           |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**              | 1, -1        | -1, 1        |
| **A1**              | -1, 1        | 1, -1        |

### Step 2: Identifying Dominant Strategies
In this case, we notice that:

- If Player 2 chooses A0:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets 1 point.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets -1 points.

- If Player 2 chooses A1:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets -1 points.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets 1 point.

### Step 3: Mixed Strategy Analysis
Neither action A0 nor action A1 strictly dominates the other. Therefore, Player 2 might consider a mixed strategy where both actions are chosen with some probabilities.

Given the symmetry and the nature of the payoffs (where the goal is to maximize Player 2's points), we recognize that a 50-50 distribution might be optimal to avoid being too predictable and thus mitigate the risk of consistently getting -1 points.

### Step 4: Formulate the Final Strategy
To prevent the other player from exploiting a consistent strategy, it is often optimal to randomize our actions with equal probability. Consequently:

- Probability of choosing A0 = 50%
- Probability of choosing A1 = 50%

### Step 5: Construct the JSON Object
Finally, we'll format our decision as a valid JSON object where the sum of the probabilities equals 100%:

```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

This balanced strategy ensures that Player 2 maximizes their expected payoff by remaining unpredictable in their choices.

### Summary
The final answer is:

```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure

Let me create a payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):

```
                Other: A0    Other: A1
My A0:              +1           -1
My A1:              -1           +1
```

## Step 2: Identify the Game Type

This is an **anti-coordination game** (similar to matching pennies):
- I get +1 when we both choose the same action (A0-A0 or A1-A1)
- I get -1 when we choose different actions
- The other player has exactly opposite incentives
- This is a zero-sum game (payoffs always sum to 0)

## Step 3: Analyze Pure Strategy Equilibria

There are no pure strategy Nash equilibria because:
- If I choose A0, the other player prefers A1
- If I choose A1, the other player prefers A0
- This creates a cycle with no stable pure strategy outcome

## Step 4: Find Mixed Strategy Equilibrium

Let me play A0 with probability p and A1 with probability (1-p).
Let the other player play A0 with probability q.

My expected payoff = p·q·(1) + p·(1-q)·(-1) + (1-p)·q·(-1) + (1-p)·(1-q)·(1)
                    = 4pq - 2p - 2q + 1

For a mixed strategy equilibrium, the other player should make me indifferent between A0 and A1.

Taking the derivative with respect to p: 4q - 2 = 0
Therefore: q = 1/2

By symmetry (this is a symmetric zero-sum game), the equilibrium also requires: p = 1/2

## Step 5: Verify the Solution

At 50-50 mixing, my expected payoff is 0 regardless of what I choose, confirming this is the Nash equilibrium and the maximin strategy in this zero-sum game.

**Final Answer:**

{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure

Let me create a payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):

```
                Other Player
                A0      A1
Player 1  A0     1      -1
          A1    -1       1
```

Key observations:
- I get **+1** when we **match** (both A0 or both A1)
- I get **-1** when we **don't match**
- The other player has opposite payoffs
- This is a **zero-sum game** (my payoff + other's payoff = 0)

## Step 2: Identify Game Type

This is a "matching pennies" type game where:
- I want to match the other player's choice
- The other player wants to avoid matching
- There's a conflict of interest

## Step 3: Check for Pure Strategy Equilibrium

- If I always choose A0, the other player should choose A1 (to get +1)
- But then I should switch to A1 (to match and get +1)
- But then the other player should switch to A0
- This cycle continues - **no pure strategy equilibrium exists**

## Step 4: Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium

Let's say I play A0 with probability p.

For a mixed strategy equilibrium, the other player must be indifferent between their choices, which happens when my strategy makes both their options equally valuable.

Expected payoff for other player if they choose A0: p(-1) + (1-p)(1) = 1 - 2p
Expected payoff for other player if they choose A1: p(1) + (1-p)(-1) = 2p - 1

Setting these equal: 1 - 2p = 2p - 1
Solving: 4p = 2, so **p = 1/2**

By symmetry, the other player should also play each action with probability 1/2.

## Step 5: Verify Equilibrium Payoff

At equilibrium (50-50 split for both players):
- Expected payoff = 0.5×0.5×(1) + 0.5×0.5×(-1) + 0.5×0.5×(-1) + 0.5×0.5×(1) = 0

This is the minimax solution - neither player can do better given the other's strategy.

## Conclusion

The optimal strategy is to play each action with equal probability, ensuring the other player cannot exploit my choices.

{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}

Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing your points in this game.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

We are given a symmetric two-player game with the following payoffs (Player 1's payoff first, Player 2's second):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0            | A1            |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**               | (1, -1)       | (-1, 1)       |
| **A1**               | (-1, 1)       | (1, -1)       |

Note:
- If both choose A0 → you get 1, opponent gets -1
- If you choose A0, opponent chooses A1 → you get -1, opponent gets 1
- If you choose A1, opponent chooses A0 → you get -1, opponent gets 1
- If both choose A1 → you get 1, opponent gets -1

This is a **zero-sum game** because the sum of payoffs in every outcome is zero:
- (1 + (-1)) = 0
- (-1 + 1) = 0
- etc.

So whatever one player gains, the other loses.

---

### Step 2: Identify Game Type

This is a classic **matching-pennies type game**, similar to "Matching Pennies":
- You want to **match** if you're playing A0/A1 and getting positive payoff when outcomes match.
- But observe:
    - When **both play same action (A0 or A1)** → you get **+1**
    - When **actions differ** → you get **-1**

So your goal is to **match** the other player's action.

But since the other player is also trying to maximize their own payoff, they will try to avoid matching you — they want the opposite.

This creates a **purely antagonistic dynamic**. The game is symmetric and zero-sum.

---

### Step 3: Find the Nash Equilibrium

In such games, the optimal strategy is often a **mixed strategy** equilibrium where each player randomizes their choice to make the opponent indifferent.

Let’s denote:
- Let **p** be the probability that *you* play A0.
- Let **q** be the probability that the other player plays A0.

Your expected payoff when playing A0:
- With probability q: opponent plays A0 → you get +1
- With probability (1−q): opponent plays A1 → you get −1
→ Expected payoff from A0: *1×q + (−1)×(1−q) = q − (1−q) = 2q − 1*

Your expected payoff when playing A1:
- With probability q: opponent plays A0 → you get −1
- With probability (1−q): opponent plays A1 → you get +1
→ Expected payoff from A1: (−1)×q + 1×(1−q) = −q + 1 − q = 1 − 2q

At equilibrium, you should be indifferent between A0 and A1 — otherwise, you’d switch entirely to the better option.

Set the two payoffs equal:

2q − 1 = 1 − 2q  
⇒ 4q = 2  
⇒ q = 0.5

So, if the opponent plays A0 with probability 0.5, then your expected payoff from A0 and A1 is the same.

To make the opponent indifferent, we apply symmetry: since the game is symmetric, you should also play each action with 50% chance.

Thus, the unique Nash equilibrium is:
- Play A0 with probability 50%
- Play A1 with probability 50%

This way, no matter what the opponent does, you’re not exploitable, and you guarantee an expected payoff of 0 (which is the best possible in a zero-sum game against rational opponent).

---

### Step 4: Verify That This Maximizes Your Expected Points

Since this is a zero-sum symmetric game, and the game has a well-known mixed-strategy equilibrium, the solution is indeed:
- Probability of A0: 50%
- Probability of A1: 50%

Any deviation would allow the opponent to exploit you.

Moreover, your total expected points over many rounds will stabilize around 0 per round — which is the best guaranteed result against a rational adversary.

---

### Final Output Format

We must return a JSON object with integer percentages summing to 100.

So:
- A0: 50
- A1: 50

```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure
Let me create a payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):

|          | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| My A0    | +1          | -1          |
| My A1    | -1          | +1          |

This is a **matching pennies** game where:
- I win (+1) when we both choose the same action
- I lose (-1) when we choose different actions
- The opponent has opposite incentives (they win when we mismatch)

### Step 2: Identify Game Type
This is a zero-sum game. My gain is the opponent's loss and vice versa. There's no pure strategy Nash equilibrium because:
- If I always play A0, opponent should play A1
- If I always play A1, opponent should play A0
- This creates a cycle with no stable pure strategy

### Step 3: Find the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
Let me find when I'm indifferent between my actions.

If opponent plays A0 with probability q:
- Expected payoff from A0: q(1) + (1-q)(-1) = 2q - 1
- Expected payoff from A1: q(-1) + (1-q)(1) = 1 - 2q

For indifference: 2q - 1 = 1 - 2q → q = 0.5

By symmetry of the game, the Nash equilibrium has me playing 50-50 as well.

### Step 4: Verify the Strategy
Playing 50-50:
- Guarantees expected payoff of 0 regardless of opponent's strategy
- Cannot be exploited by the opponent
- Is the maximin strategy (maximizes minimum expected payoff)

### Step 5: Conclusion
The optimal strategy is to randomize equally between both actions. This prevents the opponent from predicting and counter-playing my choice.

**Final Answer:**

{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}

Let's analyze the game step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix**

We are Player 1, and the other player is Player 2. The payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0           | A1           |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**                              | You: 1, Them: -1 | You: -1, Them: 1 |
| **A1**                              | You: -1, Them: 1 | You: 1, Them: -1 |

This is a **symmetric zero-sum game** in structure, although the payoffs are not symmetric in sign – but let’s double-check that.

Wait! Let's verify:  
- (A0, A0): You get 1, Opponent gets -1 → sum = 0  
- (A0, A1): You get -1, Opponent gets 1 → sum = 0  
- (A1, A0): You get -1, Opponent gets 1 → sum = 0  
- (A1, A1): You get 1, Opponent gets -1 → sum = 0  

✅ So this **is a zero-sum game**: total payoff for both players always sums to 0.

Also note:  
- When you and the opponent play the **same action (A0 or A1)**, you get **+1**, opponent gets **-1**  
- When you play **different actions**, you get **-1**, opponent gets **+1**

Let me rephrase:  
- You **gain 1 point** if you match the opponent’s action.  
- You **lose 1 point** if you mismatch.

So this is essentially a **matching pennies** game.

---

### **Step 2: Recognize the Game Type – Matching Pennies**

Matching Pennies is a classic zero-sum game where:
- Player 1 wants to **match** Player 2.
- Player 2 wants to **mismatch** (or vice versa, depending on convention).

But in our case:
- If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A0 → match → you get +1 → so you want to match.
- If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A1 → mismatch → you get -1 → so you don’t want to mismatch.

So yes: **you want to match the opponent’s choice**.

But from the opponent’s perspective:
- If they choose A0 and you choose A0 → they get -1 → so they want to avoid matching.
- If they choose A0 and you choose A1 → they get +1 → so they want to mismatch.

So the opponent wants to **mismatch** you.

Therefore, this is a classic **matching pennies** game:
- You want to **match**.
- Opponent wants to **mismatch**.

This is a well-known game with a **unique Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies**.

---

### **Step 3: Find the Nash Equilibrium (Mixed Strategy)**

Let’s find the optimal mixed strategy for **Player 1** (you).

Let:
- You play A0 with probability **p**
- You play A1 with probability **1 - p**

Let the opponent play A0 with probability **q**, A1 with **1 - q**

Your expected payoff (from your perspective) when you choose A0:
- If opponent plays A0: you get 1 → probability q
- If opponent plays A1: you get -1 → probability 1 - q
→ Expected payoff if you play A0:  
**1*q + (-1)*(1 - q) = q - 1 + q = 2q - 1**

Your expected payoff if you play A1:
- Opponent plays A0: you get -1 → prob q
- Opponent plays A1: you get 1 → prob 1 - q
→ Expected payoff:  
**(-1)*q + 1*(1 - q) = -q + 1 - q = 1 - 2q**

In equilibrium, your strategy must make the opponent indifferent between choosing A0 and A1. But since you are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**, and the game is zero-sum, in equilibrium you should be choosing a strategy such that **the opponent cannot exploit you**.

But since you are the one deciding your strategy, and assuming the other player will play optimally in response, the Nash equilibrium is where **both players randomize 50-50**.

Why?

Because in Matching Pennies:
- The optimal strategy for each player is to play A0 and A1 each with 50% probability.

Let’s verify:

Suppose the **opponent plays 50% A0, 50% A1**.

Then your expected payoff for playing A0:
- 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0

Your expected payoff for playing A1:
- 0.5 * (-1) + 0.5 * 1 = -0.5 + 0.5 = 0

So you are indifferent. Therefore, any mixture (including 50-50) gives you expected payoff 0.

But now, suppose you deviate. For example, if you play A0 with probability > 0.5.

Then the opponent (if playing optimally) will adjust to minimize your payoff.

But **in Nash equilibrium**, neither player can gain by unilaterally changing strategy.

And in matching pennies, the **unique Nash equilibrium** is:
- **Both players play A0 with 50%, A1 with 50%**

Because if you play 50-50, no matter what the opponent does, your expected payoff is 0 (you can’t do better), and similarly for them.

Thus, as Player 1, to **maximize your minimum expected payoff** (i.e., play safely against an optimal opponent), you must play the Nash equilibrium strategy.

---

### **Step 4: Choose Your Probability Distribution**

Therefore, optimal strategy:
- **A0**: 50%
- **A1**: 50%

This ensures you get 0 expected payoff **no matter what the opponent does** (if they play optimally), and you **cannot be exploited**.

---

### **Step 5: Final Output Format**

We must output a JSON object:
- Keys: "A0", "A1"
- Values: integers (percentage points)
- Sum: 100

So:
```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P1
response:
Let's analyze this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the payoff structure

We are given a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1 for each player. The payoffs are:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Payoff | Other Player's Payoff |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 1            | -1                     |
| A0          | A1                     | -1           | 1                      |
| A1          | A0                     | -1           | 1                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 1            | -1                     |

This is a symmetric game (in structure), and more importantly — it's a **zero-sum game** because the sum of payoffs in every outcome is zero:

- (1, -1) → sum = 0
- (-1, 1) → sum = 0
- (-1, 1) → sum = 0
- (1, -1) → sum = 0

So, this is a **zero-sum game**, and we are Player 1 trying to maximize our expected payoff.

---

### Step 2: Determine the type of game

Looking at the payoffs:

- When both players play the same action (A0 or A1), you get +1.
- When they play different actions (one A0, one A1), you get -1.

So:

- If you match the other player’s action → +1
- If you mismatch → -1

This is a **coordination game with a twist**: it rewards matching, but the other player is trying to *minimize* your payoff (since it's zero-sum).

Wait — actually, from the payoffs, when you match (both A0 or both A1), you get +1 and the opponent gets -1. When you differ, you get -1 and the opponent gets +1.

So: **This is a matching-pennies game** — a classic example of a zero-sum game.

Yes! Matching pennies:
- You want to coordinate (match).
- Opponent wants to mismatch (or vice versa, depending on perspective).
- Here, since both players get +1 when they match and -1 when they differ, this is symmetric — but in a zero-sum setting, the opponent wants to *avoid* matching you.

Wait — but here’s a key point: both players are trying to maximize their *own* payoff. Since it's zero-sum, maximizing your payoff is equivalent to minimizing the opponent’s. But the game structure is symmetric.

In standard matching pennies:
- One player wins if they match, the other if they mismatch.
- But here, **both players get +1 if they match**, and -1 if they mismatch.

Wait — that’s not matching pennies. That would mean both players benefit from matching. But that’s not zero-sum in spirit.

But hold on: the payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): (1, -1)
- (A0, A1): (-1, 1)
- (A1, A0): (-1, 1)
- (A1, A1): (1, -1)

So your payoff:
- +1 if you choose the same as the other player
- -1 if you choose differently

The opponent's payoff is the opposite: -1 if you match, +1 if you mismatch.

So:
- You get +1 when you **match**
- You get -1 when you **mismatch**

But the opponent gets +1 when they **mismatch**, i.e., when you don’t match them.

So: **You want to match the other player. The other player wants to mismatch you.**

This **is** a **matching pennies game**, but with roles reversed.

In standard matching pennies:
- Player 1 wants to match
- Player 2 wants to mismatch (or vice versa)

But here, both players have:
- You (Player 1) want to match the other player.
- Other player wants to mismatch you (since they get +1 when you differ).

So yes — this is standard **matching pennies**, with the **roles of "match" and "mismatch" defined by the payoffs**.

---

### Step 3: Find the Nash equilibrium (mixed strategy)

In a zero-sum game like matching pennies, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both players play **mixed strategies** such that the other player is indifferent between their pure strategies.

Let’s suppose:
- You (Player 1) play A0 with probability p, A1 with probability (1 - p)
- The other player (Player 2) plays A0 with probability q, A1 with probability (1 - q)

We want to find your optimal p.

Your expected payoff depends on the other player’s choice.

But since the other player is rational and also trying to maximize their own payoff (i.e., minimize yours), they will play optimally in response.

In zero-sum games, the optimal strategy for each player is to make the other player indifferent.

So let’s compute your expected payoff if you play A0 with probability p, and the other player plays A0 with probability q.

Then, your expected payoff is:

E = 
- If other player plays A0 (prob q): 
  - You play A0 (p): get +1
  - You play A1 (1-p): get -1
  → Your expected payoff given q: p*(1) + (1-p)*(-1) = 2p - 1
- If other player plays A1 (prob 1 - q):
  - You play A0 (p): get -1
  - You play A1 (1-p): get +1
  → Your expected payoff: p*(-1) + (1-p)*(1) = -2p + 1

So overall expected payoff:

E = q*(2p - 1) + (1 - q)*(-2p + 1)

Let’s expand:

E = q(2p - 1) + (1 - q)(-2p + 1)  
= 2pq - q -2p + 1 + 2pq - 2p(1 - q)? Wait, let’s compute carefully:

(1 - q)(-2p + 1) = -2p(1 - q) + 1(1 - q) = -2p + 2pq + 1 - q

Then total:

E = (2pq - q) + (-2p + 2pq + 1 - q)  
= 2pq - q -2p + 2pq + 1 - q  
= 4pq - 2q - 2p + 1

Now, the **other player** wants to **minimize** this expected payoff (since it's zero-sum and they want to maximize their own).

But since you are choosing p, and you want to **maximize your minimum expected payoff**, we seek a value of p such that the opponent cannot exploit you — i.e., the value of E is independent of q.

Alternatively, use the **indifference principle**: to make the opponent indifferent between playing A0 or A1, we can set p so that the opponent’s expected payoff is the same regardless of their choice.

But since we are Player 1, and we want a strategy that maximizes our **minimum possible payoff**, we find p such that the other player is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Wait — better: from the opponent’s perspective, what is their expected payoff if they play A0?

If they play A0, then:
- You play A0 (p): payoff = -1
- You play A1 (1-p): payoff = 1
→ Their expected payoff: p*(-1) + (1-p)*(1) = -p + 1 - p = 1 - 2p

If they play A1:
- You play A0 (p): payoff = 1
- You play A1 (1-p): payoff = -1
→ Their payoff: p*(1) + (1-p)*(-1) = p - 1 + p = 2p - 1

So their expected payoff:
- A0: 1 - 2p
- A1: 2p - 1

To make them indifferent, we set:
1 - 2p = 2p - 1  
1 + 1 = 2p + 2p  
2 = 4p  
p = 0.5

So if you play A0 with 50% probability, the other player is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Therefore, **the best response for them is any mixed strategy** — but since they are maximizing their own payoff, they can choose freely. But in equilibrium, they will choose a strategy such that you are also indifferent.

Similarly, we can compute from your perspective.

Now, if you play p = 0.5, what is your expected payoff?

Recall:  
E = 4pq - 2q - 2p + 1

Plug p = 0.5:

E = 4*(0.5)*q - 2q - 2*(0.5) + 1  
= 2q - 2q - 1 + 1 = 0

So expected payoff is 0, regardless of q.

Similarly, if the other player plays q = 0.5, then your expected payoff is:

E = 4p*(0.5) - 2*(0.5) - 2p + 1  
= 2p - 1 - 2p + 1 = 0

So in the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**, both players play A0 with 50% probability, A1 with 50% probability.

At this equilibrium, your expected payoff is 0.

And since any deviation from p = 0.5 would allow the opponent to exploit you (if they play optimally), **this is the optimal strategy for you** — it guarantees that no matter what the other player does (assuming they're rational and optimize), you get at least 0 expected payoff, and in equilibrium, exactly 0.

But the question says: **maximize your total points**.

In a single round? Or over many rounds?

The setup says: "each round" — but we are not told how many rounds. However, since it says "total points", and we are to choose a probability distribution per round, and act simultaneously each round, we are likely in a repeated game.

But crucially — unless there’s cooperation or learning, the **best response** in each round, assuming the other player is adversarial and rational, is to play the **Nash equilibrium mixed strategy**.

If you deviate — say, play A0 with 100% — then the other player can exploit by always playing A1, and you get -1 every time.

Similarly, if you play A0 100%, they play A1 → you get -1.

So you **must** mix to prevent exploitation.

Therefore, to **maximize your guaranteed minimum payoff**, you should play a strategy that makes the opponent indifferent.

This leads to the **unique** optimal mixed strategy: **play A0 with 50%, A1 with 50%**.

This is the **minimax strategy** in zero-sum games.

---

### Step 4: Final decision

You should choose:

- A0: 50%
- A1: 50%

This is optimal in expectation and robust against any behavior of the other player.

response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff structure

From my perspective as Player 2, let me create a payoff matrix:

```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0         1              -1
Player 2: A1        -1               1
```

## Step 2: Identify the game type

This is a **matching game** from my perspective:
- I want to match Player 1's action to get 1 point
- If we mismatch, I get -1 points

From Player 1's perspective, it's the opposite (they want to mismatch).

This is a **zero-sum game** where our payoffs always sum to zero.

## Step 3: Analyze best responses

If Player 1 plays A0 with probability p:
- My expected payoff from A0: p(1) + (1-p)(-1) = 2p - 1
- My expected payoff from A1: p(-1) + (1-p)(1) = 1 - 2p

For Player 1 to be indifferent about my choice (so I can't be exploited):
- They need: 1 - 2q = 2q - 1 (where q is my probability of A0)
- This gives: q = 0.5

## Step 4: Find Nash equilibrium

For me to be indifferent (optimal mixed strategy):
- 2p - 1 = 1 - 2p
- 4p = 2
- p = 0.5

The **Nash equilibrium** is for both players to play each action with 50% probability. This ensures:
- Neither player can be exploited
- Expected payoff is 0 for both players
- No incentive to deviate unilaterally

response:
Let's analyze the game step by step to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing our points as Player 1.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

We are Player 1, and the other player is Player 2. We each choose an action: A0 or A1.

The payoffs are as follows:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0         | A1         |
|---------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**              | (1, -1)    | (-1, 1)    |
| **A1**              | (-1, 1)    | (1, -1)    |

So:
- If both choose A0: You get 1, opponent gets -1.
- If you choose A0, opponent chooses A1: You get -1, opponent gets 1.
- If you choose A1, opponent chooses A0: You get -1, opponent gets 1.
- If both choose A1: You get 1, opponent gets -1.

This is a **zero-sum game** (total points sum to 0 in every outcome), because:
- (1 + (-1)) = 0
- (-1 + 1) = 0
- etc.

So, this is a symmetric zero-sum game, and we are trying to maximize our expected payoff, while the opponent is trying to minimize our payoff (or maximize their own).

---

### Step 2: Look for a Nash Equilibrium

In such symmetric zero-sum games, the optimal strategy is often a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s assume:
- You (Player 1) choose A0 with probability *p*, A1 with probability (1 - p).
- The opponent (Player 2) chooses A0 with probability *q*, A1 with probability (1 - q).

We want to find the value of *p* that makes the opponent indifferent between choosing A0 and A1, and similarly, the *q* that makes you indifferent.

But since we are Player 1 and want to maximize our expected payoff, and the game is symmetric (except for roles), we can solve for the Nash equilibrium mixed strategy.

---

### Step 3: Compute Expected Payoff for Player 1

Let’s compute your expected payoff given that you play A0 with probability *p*, and the opponent plays A0 with probability *q*.

Your expected payoff E is:

E = p * q * (1) + p * (1 - q) * (-1) + (1 - p) * q * (-1) + (1 - p) * (1 - q) * (1)

Simplify:

E = pq - p(1 - q) - q(1 - p) + (1 - p)(1 - q)

Break it down:
- pq
- -p + pq
- -q + pq
- 1 - p - q + pq

Now sum all:

E = pq + (-p + pq) + (-q + pq) + (1 - p - q + pq)

= pq - p + pq - q + pq + 1 - p - q + pq

Combine like terms:

= 4pq - 2p - 2q + 1

So:
> **E(p, q) = 4pq - 2p - 2q + 1**

Now, since this is a zero-sum game, the optimal strategy for Player 1 is to choose *p* such that the expected payoff is maximized, assuming the opponent is also choosing optimally.

To find the Nash equilibrium, we find the *p* that makes Player 2 **indifferent** between A0 and A1 (i.e., choosing A0 and A1 gives same expected payoff to the opponent).

But since we want to maximize our payoff, we can instead find the *p* that minimizes the opponent's best response or makes our payoff stable.

Alternatively, we can **set up the indifference condition** for the opponent.

Let’s compute the opponent’s expected payoff, which is the negative of yours (since zero-sum):

Opponent’s expected payoff = -E(p, q) = -4pq + 2p + 2q - 1

But we can proceed by finding the value of *p* such that the opponent is **indifferent** between playing A0 and A1.

Let’s fix *p*, and compute opponent’s payoff from choosing A0 vs A1.

#### Opponent’s payoff if they play A0:
- You play A0 (prob p): they get -1
- You play A1 (prob 1-p): they get 1

So expected payoff = p*(-1) + (1 - p)*(1) = -p + 1 - p = 1 - 2p

#### Opponent’s payoff if they play A1:
- You play A0 (prob p): they get 1
- You play A1 (prob 1-p): they get -1

So expected payoff = p*(1) + (1 - p)*(-1) = p - 1 + p = 2p - 1

For the opponent to be indifferent:
> 1 - 2p = 2p - 1

Solve:
1 - 2p = 2p - 1  
1 + 1 = 2p + 2p  
2 = 4p  
p = 0.5

So, if you play A0 with probability 50%, the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Thus, the **optimal strategy for Player 1** is to play A0 with probability 50% (and A1 with 50%).

Similarly, by symmetry, the opponent should also play 50-50 to make you indifferent.

Now, let’s verify that this is indeed a NE.

If you play p = 0.5, then your expected payoff is:

E = 4pq - 2p - 2q + 1

Plug in p = 0.5:

E = 4*(0.5)*q - 2*(0.5) - 2q + 1  
= 2q - 1 - 2q + 1 = 0

So expected payoff is 0, regardless of q.

That means: **If you play 50-50, your expected payoff is 0 no matter what the opponent does.**

Similarly, if the opponent plays 50-50, then your best response is also 50-50.

So this is a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**, and it leads to **expected payoff of 0** for both players.

Since this is a zero-sum game, and no pure strategy gives a better expected result (in fact, any pure strategy allows the opponent to exploit you), **50-50 is the optimal strategy for Player 1**.

---

### Step 4: Final Decision

To maximize your expected payoff in the long run, **play A0 with 50% probability, A1 with 50%**.

This ensures you cannot be exploited, and your expected payoff is 0, which is the best you can guarantee in this symmetric zero-sum game.

---

response:
Let me analyze this game step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure

From my perspective (Player 1), the payoff matrix is:
- A0 vs A0: I get **1** point
- A0 vs A1: I get **-1** point
- A1 vs A0: I get **-1** point
- A1 vs A1: I get **1** point

**Key insight**: I win (+1) when we match (both choose same action), and lose (-1) when we mismatch.

## Step 2: Recognize the Game Type

This is a **matching pennies** game - a zero-sum game where:
- I want to match the other player's choice
- The other player wants to mismatch my choice
- Our interests are directly opposed

## Step 3: Analyze Pure Strategies

There is no dominant pure strategy because:
- If I always play A0, the other player should play A1 to win
- If I always play A1, the other player should play A0 to win
- Any predictable pattern can be exploited

## Step 4: Find the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium

Let me check if the other player can exploit any probability distribution I choose.

If I play A0 with probability p:
- Other player's expected payoff from A0: p(-1) + (1-p)(1) = 1 - 2p
- Other player's expected payoff from A1: p(1) + (1-p)(-1) = 2p - 1

For the other player to be indifferent (unable to exploit me):
1 - 2p = 2p - 1
4p = 2
**p = 0.5**

Similarly, I need to be unexploitable, which occurs when both actions have equal probability.

## Step 5: Conclusion

The optimal strategy is to make myself **unpredictable** by playing each action with equal probability. This prevents the other player from exploiting my choices and guarantees an expected payoff of 0 (the value of the game).

response:
To maximize the points received in a zero-sum game like the one described (a version of the "Matching Pennies" game), we must identify the Nash equilibrium.

1.  **Analyze the Payoff Matrix for Player 2 (Me):**
    *   If (P1: A0, P2: A0): I get +1.
    *   If (P1: A1, P2: A0): I get -1.
    *   If (P1: A0, P2: A1): I get -1.
    *   If (P1: A1, P2: A1): I get +1.

2.  **Determine the Objectives:**
    *   As Player 2, my goal is to **match** Player 1's action (A0-A0 or A1-A1).
    *   Player 1’s goal is to **mismatch** my action (A0-A1 or A1-A0), as that gives them 1 point and me -1.

3.  **Evaluate Strategy via Minimax:**
    *   If I choose A0 more often (e.g., 60%), a rational Player 1 will notice this and choose A1 more often (100% of the time in a perfect scenario) to exploit me, resulting in a negative expected payoff for me.
    *   If I choose A1 more often, a rational Player 1 will choose A0 more often to exploit that, also resulting in a negative expected payoff.
    *   The only strategy that cannot be exploited is the Nash equilibrium, where I randomize my choices so that the other player has no advantage regardless of what they choose.

4.  **Calculate the Nash Equilibrium:**
    *   Let $q$ be the probability that I choose A0.
    *   Expected value $E = p[q(1) + (1-q)(-1)] + (1-p)[q(-1) + (1-q)(1)]$, where $p$ is the probability Player 1 chooses A0.
    *   Simplifying: $E = p(2q - 1) + (1-p)(1 - 2q)$.
    *   Setting $\frac{dE}{dq} = 0$ gives $4p - 2 = 0$, or $p = 0.5$.
    *   Similarly, for Player 1, setting $\frac{dE}{dp} = 0$ gives $4q - 2 = 0$, or $q = 0.5$.

5.  **Final Decision:**
    To maximize points against a rational competitor and remain unexploitable, a 50/50 distribution between A0 and A1 is the optimal strategy.

response:
Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the payoff structure

We are in a 2-player simultaneous move game. Each player chooses an action: A0 or A1. The payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | +1          | -1                     |
| A0          | A1                     | -1          | +1                     |
| A1          | A0                     | -1          | +1                     |
| A1          | A1                     | +1          | -1                     |

So, the outcomes are symmetric in a strange way:
- If both choose the same action (A0 or A1), you get +1, the other gets -1.
- If you choose differently, you get -1, the other gets +1.

Wait — this is **strange** because:
- You get +1 when you match the other player's action.
- You get -1 when you don’t match.

But the other player receives the opposite: they get +1 when you **differ**, and -1 when you **match**.

So this is a **discoordination game** — you want to **not** match the other player's action.

Wait: Let’s check this again.

- A0 vs A0 → you: +1, other: -1
- A0 vs A1 → you: -1, other: +1
- A1 vs A0 → you: -1, other: +1
- A1 vs A1 → you: +1, other: -1

So: **You get +1 if you choose the same action as the other player, -1 otherwise.**

But the other player gets +1 when they **differ** from you.

So from **your perspective**, you want to **match** the other player's action.

From **the other player’s** perspective, they want to **differ** from you.

This is **not symmetric** — it’s a **mismatching incentive** for the two players, which makes it a **zero-sum game with antagonistic preferences**.

Wait — let's verify if it’s zero-sum.

Sum of payoffs in each outcome:
- (A0,A0): 1 + (-1) = 0
- (A0,A1): -1 + 1 = 0
- (A1,A0): -1 + 1 = 0
- (A1,A1): 1 + (-1) = 0

Yes! It’s a **zero-sum game**.

And in terms of your payoff:
- You get +1 if actions match
- You get -1 if actions differ

So it’s equivalent to: **You want to match the other player’s action.**

But the other player wants to **not match** you — because then they get +1.

So this is a **zero-sum game** where:
- You want to **match** the opponent.
- Opponent wants to **differ** from you.

This is a classic **anti-coordination** game from the opponent's side, but **coordination** from yours.

But since both players act simultaneously and independently, we need to find a Nash equilibrium.

---

### Step 2: Find the Nash equilibrium

Let’s define:
- Let **p** = probability you play A0 (so 1-p = probability you play A1)
- Let **q** = probability opponent plays A0 (so 1-q = probability they play A1)

Your expected payoff:

E = P(match) * (+1) + P(mismatch) * (-1)

P(match) = P(both A0) + P(both A1) = p*q + (1-p)*(1-q)

P(mismatch) = P(you A0, opp A1) + P(you A1, opp A0) = p*(1-q) + (1-p)*q

So:

E = [p q + (1-p)(1-q)] * 1 + [p(1-q) + (1-p)q] * (-1)

Simplify:
E = [pq + (1 - p - q + pq)] - [p - pq + q - pq]

E = [pq + 1 - p - q + pq] - [p + q - 2pq]

E = [1 - p - q + 2pq] - [p + q - 2pq]

E = 1 - p - q + 2pq - p - q + 2pq

E = 1 - 2p - 2q + 4pq

Now, your goal is to maximize E with respect to p, given that q is chosen by the other player.

But in a Nash equilibrium, both players are best responding.

Now, what does the opponent do?

The opponent’s payoff is:
- +1 if they **differ** from you
- -1 if they match

So, their payoff is: - (your payoff)

So their expected payoff is: -E

So they want to minimize E.

But we are solving for a Nash equilibrium: both playing best responses.

So let’s find the value of p that maximizes your expected payoff **given that the opponent is choosing q to minimize E**.

But in Nash equilibrium, both players are best responding to each other.

So we need to find (p*, q*) such that:
- Given q*, p* maximizes your E
- Given p*, q* minimizes the opponent’s payoff (i.e., minimizes their payoff, which is -E, so maximizes E for you? Wait no.)

Wait: Opponent’s payoff is **-E**, so they want to **minimize E**.

So if you play p, opponent chooses q to minimize E(p,q).

You, knowing this, choose p to maximize the **minimum** E you can get (i.e., minimax strategy).

This is a zero-sum game, so we can apply minimax.

---

### Step 3: Solve the zero-sum game

The payoff matrix for Player 1 (you) is:

|          | Opp A0 | Opp A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| You A0   | +1     | -1     |
| You A1   | -1     | +1     |

So the matrix is:

    A0   A1
A0   1   -1
A1  -1   +1

This is the **matching pennies** game.

Yes! This is **classic matching pennies**.

In matching pennies:
- Player 1 wins if actions match (+1)
- Player 2 wins if actions differ (+1 for them)

So in this case:
- You (Player 1) want to **match**
- Opponent wants to **differ**

This is **exactly** the matching pennies game.

The **unique Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies is:
- You play A0 with probability 0.5, A1 with 0.5
- Opponent plays A0 with probability 0.5, A1 with 0.5

In this equilibrium:
- Your expected payoff is:
  E = 0.5*0.5*(+1) + 0.5*0.5*(-1) + 0.5*0.5*(-1) + 0.5*0.5*(+1)
  = (0.25)(1) + (0.25)(-1) + (0.25)(-1) + (0.25)(1)
  = 0.25 - 0.25 - 0.25 + 0.25 = 0

So your expected payoff is 0.

Is there a better strategy?

Suppose you deviate: say you play A0 with probability 1.

Then opponent, wanting to minimize your payoff (since they get -E), will play A0 with probability 0 → play A1 always.

Then:
- You choose A0, opponent chooses A1 → you get -1

So expected payoff: -1

Worse than 0.

If you play A1 always:
Opponent plays A0 → you get -1

Again, -1.

So best response to pure strategies is to play A0 or A1 always, but opponent just exploits that.

So the only way to prevent the opponent from exploiting you is to randomize equally.

Thus, the **Nash equilibrium** is to play **50% A0, 50% A1**.

And since this is a zero-sum game, and you are maximizing your expected payoff, and no strategy can guarantee more than 0 in the equilibrium, you should go with the equilibrium strategy.

Moreover, **if you deviate, the opponent can exploit you and your expected payoff drops**.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to play **equal probability** on both actions.

---

### Step 4: Output format

You must return a JSON object with:
- Keys: "A0" and "A1"
- Values: integers (percentage points)
- Sum must be 100

So:

{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}

This is the optimal mixed strategy to maximize your expected payoff in this zero-sum game.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff structure

Let me create a payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):

|          | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **My A0** | I get 1      | I get -1     |
| **My A1** | I get -1     | I get 1      |

This is an anti-coordination game where I want to **match** the other player's action (both A0 or both A1 gives me +1), while the other player wants to **mismatch** my action.

## Step 2: Analyze best responses

- If Player 1 plays A0 more often, I should play A0
- If Player 1 plays A1 more often, I should play A1
- But Player 1 wants to do the opposite of what I do

## Step 3: Find the Nash equilibrium

Let p = probability Player 1 plays A0, and q = probability I play A0.

**My expected payoff:**
- Playing A0: p(1) + (1-p)(-1) = 2p - 1
- Playing A1: p(-1) + (1-p)(1) = 1 - 2p

For me to be indifferent: 2p - 1 = 1 - 2p → p = 1/2

**Player 1's expected payoff:**
- Playing A0: q(-1) + (1-q)(1) = 1 - 2q
- Playing A1: q(1) + (1-q)(-1) = 2q - 1

For Player 1 to be indifferent: 1 - 2q = 2q - 1 → q = 1/2

## Step 4: Conclusion

The Nash equilibrium is for both players to play each action with 50% probability. Without any information about the other player's strategy, this mixed strategy equilibrium maximizes my expected payoff (which is 0 at equilibrium).

response:
Let's analyze the game step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix

We are Player 1. The other player is Player 2.

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0         | A1         |
|----------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**               | (1, -1)    | (-1, 1)    |
| **A1**               | (-1, 1)    | (1, -1)    |

This is a **zero-sum game** because for every outcome, Player 1’s gain is Player 2’s loss, and vice versa. Total points: 0 in every case.

- (1, -1) → sum = 0
- (-1, 1) → sum = 0
- (-1, 1) → sum = 0
- (1, -1) → sum = 0

So this is a **symmetric zero-sum game**, and both players have the same set of payoffs but with opposite signs.

---

### Step 2: Determine if there is a Nash equilibrium

We are looking for a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.

Let:
- Player 1 choose A0 with probability **p**, A1 with probability **1 - p**
- Player 2 choose A0 with probability **q**, A1 with probability **1 - q**

We want to find a value of **p** such that Player 1 is indifferent to Player 2's strategy, and vice versa, which defines a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

But since both players are trying to maximize their own expected payoff (and this is symmetric), the equilibrium should be symmetric.

Let’s compute the **expected payoff** for Player 1 when choosing A0 vs A1, given Player 2's mixed strategy.

#### Expected payoff for Player 1 if choosing A0:
- With probability q: Player 2 chooses A0 → payoff = 1
- With probability (1 - q): Player 2 chooses A1 → payoff = -1
→ E[A0] = q(1) + (1 - q)(-1) = q - (1 - q) = 2q - 1

#### Expected payoff for Player 1 if choosing A1:
- With probability q: Player 2 chooses A0 → payoff = -1
- With probability (1 - q): Player 2 chooses A1 → payoff = 1
→ E[A1] = q(-1) + (1 - q)(1) = -q + 1 - q = 1 - 2q

For Player 1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1 (i.e., no incentive to switch), we set:
> E[A0] = E[A1]  
2q - 1 = 1 - 2q  
4q = 2  
q = 0.5

So if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.5, then Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Similarly, by symmetry, if Player 1 plays A0 with probability 0.5, then Player 2 is also indifferent.

Therefore, **(p = 0.5, q = 0.5)** is a Nash equilibrium.

---

### Step 3: Why is this optimal?

In this equilibrium, both players randomize 50-50 between A0 and A1.

At this point:
- Player 1’s expected payoff:  
  Let’s compute it.

  P(A0,A0) = 0.5×0.5 = 0.25 → payoff = 1  
  P(A0,A1) = 0.5×0.5 = 0.25 → payoff = -1  
  P(A1,A0) = 0.5×0.5 = 0.25 → payoff = -1  
  P(A1,A1) = 0.5×0.5 = 0.25 → payoff = 1  

  Expected payoff = 0.25(1) + 0.25(-1) + 0.25(-1) + 0.25(1)  
  = 0.25 - 0.25 - 0.25 + 0.25 = 0

So the expected payoff is 0.

But is this the best we can do?

Since it's a zero-sum game, and this is a symmetric Nash equilibrium, **no player can unilaterally deviate and gain**. So this is the **optimal guaranteed strategy**.

If we play anything else, and Player 2 detects a bias, they can exploit it.

For example:
- If we play A0 with p > 0.5, then Player 2 will respond by playing A1 more often (since A0 is "dangerous" for us when they play A1), and we’ll get lower payoff.

Thus, the **minimax strategy** is to play p = 0.5.

---

### Step 4: Final Answer

We are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 — each as integer percentages summing to 100.

The optimal symmetric strategy is 50% for A0, 50% for A1.

Thus:
```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 1 points, the other player gets -1 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get -1 points, the other player gets 1 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get -1 points, the other player gets 1 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets -1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

response:
Let's analyze this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the game structure

This is a two-player simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

You are **Player 2**, and your opponent is **Player 1**.

The payoff matrix (Player 2's payoffs in each scenario):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0        | A1        |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**              | 1         | -1        |
| **A1**              | -1        | 1         |

Note: The payoffs are as described:
- (A0, A0): You (Player 2) get 1
- (A0, A1): You get -1
- (A1, A0): You get -1
- (A1, A1): You get 1

So your payoff matrix is:
- If you play A0: you get 1 if opponent plays A0, -1 if opponent plays A1
- If you play A1: you get -1 if opponent plays A0, 1 if opponent plays A1

This is a **zero-sum game** in terms of outcomes (one player gains what the other loses), but not symmetric — the sums of payoffs in each outcome are:
- (1, -1)
- (-1, 1)
- (-1, 1)
- (1, -1)

So yes, **it's a zero-sum game**: total payoff is always 0.

---

### Step 2: Identify the type of game

This game is similar to a **matching pennies** game.

- You want to match your opponent’s action: if opponent plays A0, you want to play A0 to get +1; if opponent plays A1, you want to play A1 to get +1.

But wait — the payoffs tell a different story:

- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → you get +1
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get -1

So you get +1 when actions **match**, -1 when they **differ**.

Similarly:
- You get +1 when both choose A1 → match
- -1 when you choose A1, opponent chooses A0 → mismatch

So this is **exactly** the **matching pennies** game:
- You get +1 if actions are the same (A0–A0 or A1–A1)
- You get -1 if actions are different (A0–A1 or A1–A0)

This is a classic **zero-sum, symmetric** game with no pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

---

### Step 3: Find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium

In matching pennies, the unique Nash equilibrium is for both players to play A0 and A1 with equal probability: 50% each.

Let’s verify.

Let:
- Player 1 (opponent) play A0 with probability `p`
- You (Player 2) play A0 with probability `q`

Your expected payoff:

- If you play A0: expected payoff = p*(1) + (1-p)*(-1) = p - (1-p) = 2p - 1
- If you play A1: expected payoff = p*(-1) + (1-p)*(1) = -p + (1-p) = 1 - 2p

In equilibrium, you must be indifferent between A0 and A1, so:

2p - 1 = 1 - 2p  
→ 4p = 2  
→ p = 0.5

Similarly, for Player 1 to be indifferent, they must also play 50-50.

So the Nash equilibrium is both players playing A0 with 50%, A1 with 50%.

This is the only stable strategy where neither player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy.

---

### Step 4: Your objective

You want to **maximize your total expected points**.

Since this is a one-shot game (implied), but you're choosing a strategy, the optimal strategy is the one that maximizes your minimum expected payoff (maximin), or the one that is part of the Nash equilibrium.

If you deviate from 50-50, and the opponent plays 50-50, you still get 0 expected payoff.

But if you play non-50%, and the opponent plays optimally (50-50), your expected payoff is still 0.

However, if you **know** the opponent is not playing 50-50, you could exploit them.

But the problem doesn’t say anything about the other player’s strategy — you’re supposed to choose your own strategy in a rational way.

Since you don't know the other player’s strategy, and no information is given, the rational and safest choice (which is also the equilibrium strategy) is to play **50% A0, 50% A1**, to avoid being exploited.

Any deviation from 50-50 can be exploited by a rational opponent.

---

### Step 5: Final decision

To maximize your expected points in the absence of information about the other player’s strategy, and given that the game is symmetric and zero-sum, playing **50% A0 and 50% A1** is the optimal strategy.

This is the only symmetric Nash equilibrium and ensures that you cannot be exploited.

---

### Step 6: Output in required format

You must output a JSON object with integer percentage points for A0 and A1, summing to 100.

{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}

This meets all requirements.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
