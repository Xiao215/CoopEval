    "response": "To maximize your points in this game, let's analyze the payoff structure and the impact of the proposed contract.\n\n### 1. Game Analysis\nThe original game is a zero-sum game akin to \"Matching Pennies\":\n- (A0, A0): (1, -1)\n- (A0, A1): (-1, 1)\n- (A1, A0): (-1, 1)\n- (A1, A1): (1, -1)\nThe Nash Equilibrium for this game is both players choosing actions with 50% probability, resulting in an expected payoff of 0 for both.\n\n### 2. Contract Analysis\nA contract specifies extra payments for each action. Let our contract be `{A0: x, A1: y}`. In a two-player game, any payment received by one player is drawn from the other. Let $z = x - y$. The modified payoff matrix becomes:\n- (A0, A0): (1 + 0, -1 + 0) = (1, -1)\n- (A0, A1): (-1 + z, 1 - z)\n- (A1, A0): (-1 - z, 1 + z)\n- (A1, A1): (1 + 0, -1 + 0) = (1, -1)\n\n### 3. Value of the Modified Game\nFor the player in Position 1 (us), the value $V$ of this modified game can be calculated as:\n- For $|z| \\leq 2$, $V = \\frac{z^2}{4}$.\n- For $|z| > 2$, $V = 1$.\nSince the game is zero-sum, any gain for Player 1 is a loss for Player 2. If $z \\neq 0$, then $V > 0$, meaning Player 2's expected value is negative ($V_2 < 0$).\n\n### 4. Decision Strategy\nTo activate a contract, both players must accept it. A rational Player 2 will reject any contract where $V_2 < 0$. However, people or automated players may not always behave perfectly rationally, or may approve a contract if the payments seem balanced or if they anticipate a specific strategy. Proposing a contract with $z = 0$ results in no change to the game value ($V=0$). Proposing a contract with $z \\neq 0$ aims for $V > 0$. Given our objective is to maximize points, we should propose a contract that offers potential gains while remaining simple. Values like `{ \"A0\": 1, \"A1\": -1 }` create a $z=2$, making the value of the game $1$ for us if the other player plays A0, which is the maximum possible gain in such a contract.\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": -1}\n```",

    "response": "To design an effective contract, we first analyze the structure of the game and the impact of the contract on the payoffs.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Base Game\nThe game is a simultaneous-move, zero-sum game similar to Matching Pennies. Based on the description for Player 2:\n- **(A0, A0):** P2 gets 1, P1 gets -1.\n- **(A0, A1):** P2 gets -1, P1 gets 1.\n- **(A1, A0):** P2 gets -1, P1 gets 1.\n- **(A1, A1):** P2 gets 1, P1 gets -1.\n\nIn the original game (without a contract), the Nash Equilibrium (NE) is for both players to choose A0 or A1 with a probability of 0.5. The expected value (V) for Player 2 is 0.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Contract\nA contract `{\"A0\": X, \"A1\": Y}` adds extra payoffs. If let $K = Y - X$:\n- **(A0, A0):** P2 gets 1 + (X - X) = 1.\n- **(A0, A1):** P2 gets -1 + (X - Y) = -1 - K.\n- **(A1, A0):** P2 gets -1 + (Y - X) = -1 + K.\n- **(A1, A1):** P2 gets 1 + (Y - Y) = 1.\n\n(Self-correction: In the earlier scratchpad, I explored $K=Y-X$ and $K=X-Y$. Let's ensure consistency. If P2 plays $A_j$ and P1 plays $A_i$, P2's payoff is $Base_{2}(A_i, A_j) + Contract(A_j) - Contract(A_i)$.)\nIf $K = Y - X$:\n- **(P1=A0, P2=A0):** 1\n- **(P1=A0, P2=A1):** -1 + K\n- **(P1=A1, P2=A0):** -1 - K\n- **(P1=A1, P2=A1):** 1\n\nIn any such zero-sum game where $|K| \\le 2$, the value for Player 2 is $V = K^2/4$. If $|K| > 2$, the game has a pure strategy NE with $V=1$. In all cases where $K \\neq 0$, $V > 0$.\n\n### Step 3: Approval and Acceptance\nFor the contract to become active:\n1. It must win the approval vote (be among the most approved proposals).\n2. All players must accept it.\n\nSince the base game is zero-sum and the contract is zero-sum, any advantage for Player 2 is a disadvantage for Player 1. A rational Player 1 would only accept a contract where $V \\le 0$ (for Player 2), which implies $K=0$.\n\n### Step 4: Proposal Strategy\nIf the other player is rational, no contract besides $K=0$ will be accepted. However, choosing a non-zero $K$ doesn't hurts my position; if it's rejected, we revert to the base game ($V=0$). If it's accepted (perhaps due to a calculation error or different strategy by the opponent), it increases my expected payoff. I will propose a moderate value to keep the game dynamics potentially interesting or subtly biased.\n\nProposing `{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 1}` gives $K=1$, setting the value for Player 2 at $0.25$.\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 1}\n```",

    "response": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps. The objective is to maximize your total points, while also considering that the other player must agree to the contract for it to become active. In addition, the other player will also propose their own contract, and the final contract used will be chosen through an approval voting process.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Structure without Contracts\nFirst, let\u2019s examine the payoffs in the original game without any contract:\n- Both choose A0: You get 1 point, the other player gets -1 point.\n- You choose A0, the other player chooses A1: You get -1 point, the other player gets 1 point.\n- You choose A1, the other player chooses A0: You get -1 point, the other player gets 1 point.\n- Both choose A1: You get 1 point, the other player gets -1 point.\n\nClearly, this is a zero-sum game where your gain is exactly equal to the other player's loss and vice versa.\n\n### Step 2: Designing the Contract to Maximize Acceptance\nA good contract proposal should provide enough incentive for the other player to accept while maximizing your own payoffs. \n\n### Step 3: Crafting the Contract Proposal\nSince A0 and A1 are symmetrical in their payoffs (you get the same payoff no matter whether it's A0 or A1), it\u2019s essential to ensure that the contract provides additional motivation to align players\u2019 choices.\n\nTo make the contract enticing for both:\n1. Encourage outcomes where cooperation yields favorable results.\n2. Discourage scenarios where non-cooperative behavior harms both players.\n\nGiven the nature of the game, a balanced extra reward or penalty might be effective. \n\n### Step 4: Proposed Contract\nTo encourage both players to align their choices and achieve consistent payoffs, here's the contract proposal:\n- Reward cooperative behavior (choosing same actions) by ensuring mutual gains.\n- Discourage choosing different actions as it introduces zero-sum losses.\n\nThus:\n- For A0, each player receives an extra +1 point, making A0 mutually attractive.\n- For A1, each player receives an extra +1 point as well, maintaining fairness.\n\nSo, the contract in JSON format where both actions receive additional incentives could be:\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": 1}\n```\n\n### Explanation\nWith this contract:\n- If both players choose A0, each gets an additional 1 point: 1 (base) + 1 (contract) = 2 points.\n- If both players choose A1, each gets an additional 1 point: 1 (base) + 1 (contract) = 2 points.\n- If one chooses A0 and the other chooses A1, the losses and gains are still balanced, but the incentive to cooperate is higher due to mutual extra points.\n\nUltimately, it increases the incentive for consistent choice alignment, maximizing the chances for you to achieve favorable outcomes consistently.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": 1}\n```\n\nBy applying this contract, you maximize your expected points while ensuring the other player also sees a benefit, making it more likely they will agree to it.",

    "response": "Let's break down the scenario and devise a strategy to design a contract that would maximize our expected total points while being mutually agreeable so that the other player is likely to accept it.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Payoffs Without a Contract\nThe basic payoffs of the game are defined as:\n- If both players choose A0: You get 1 points, the other player gets -1 points.\n- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get -1 points, the other player gets 1 points.\n- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get -1 points, the other player gets 1 points.\n- If both players choose A1: You get 1 points, the other player gets -1 points.\n\nFrom these payoffs, it becomes apparent that:\n- Matching choices (A0, A0) or (A1, A1) result in a net point exchange where one gains and the other loses.\n- Mismatching choices (A0, A1) or (A1, A0) result in point losses for the chooser and gains for the other player.\n\n### Step 2: Define Objectives for the Contract\nThe goal is to create an additional incentive structure that:\n1. Encourages both players to choose a particular action which would maximize our points.\n2. Is acceptable to the other player, thus requiring mutual benefits or fairness.\n\nWe need to align incentives to either (A0, A0) or (A1, A1) so that:\n- Both players get at least zero net points (neutral or positive) to keep acceptance likely.\n- Our points are maximized.\n\n### Step 3: Design the Contract\nBasis of choice:\n- Since in the original game, mutual A0 or A1 means we gain points while the other loses, we need to provide extra payoffs to neutralize this for the other player.\n\nOption for A0:\n- If both choose A0:\n  - We get 1 and they get -1. We could offer them a +1 payoff to make their total zero.\n- If we choose A0 and they choose A1:\n  - We get -1 and they get 1. Impose a payoff that neutralizes our loss & balances:\n    - We receive +1 making our net zero.\n    - They receive -1 making their net zero.\n\nOption for A1:\n- If both choose A1:\n  - We get 1 and they get -1. We offer them a +1 payoff to neutralize.\n- If we choose A1 and they choose A0:\n  - We get -1 and they get 1. Neutralize via:\n    - We receive +1 making our net zero.\n    - They receive -1 making their net zero.\n\nGiven both options are symmetrical, we simplify by making the incentives equal for both actions that's neutral or positive:\n```json\n{\n  \"A0\": 0,\n  \"A1\": 0\n}\n```\nThus, either player has no additional points' loss or gain solely from the contract, ensuring mutual acceptance is likely.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\nThe contract should be:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}\n```\n\nThis zero contract ensures:\n- No additional costs for choosing either action.\n- Keeps the game fair based on original payoffs.\n- Both players gain zero or positive points during mutual acceptance.\n\nLet's finalize the answer:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}\n```",

The other player proposes another. Then:\n- You vote on both (or more) contracts.\n- The other player votes on both.\n- The contract(s) with the most votes are selected.\n- One of them is picked at random.\n\nYour goal: **maximize your expected total points**, including:\n- Base game payoff\n- Contract payoff (if contract is accepted)\n\nSince only one contract is active (the one that gets enough votes), and it only applies if **both players accept**, we must design a contract that:\n1. Is **mutually acceptable** (so both accept), or\n2. Is acceptable to **you**, and the other player may or may not accept \u2014 but you want the contract to be selected.\n\nBut **the core insight** is:\n\n> If your contract is designed to be **mutually beneficial**, both players will accept it, and it will be **the one with two approvals**, so it will be selected.\n\nHence, **your best strategy is to propose a contract that makes both players better off than the Nash equilibrium**, and **encourage mutual acceptance**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Design a Contract That Encourages Mutual Acceptance**\n\nWe need to design a contract that:\n- Makes both players better off than 0 expected payoff (if both use 50-50), and\n- Makes both players want to accept it.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose both players play 50-50 in the base game, getting 0.\n\nCan we design a contract that gives **mutual gain**, so both players **prefer to accept and cooperate**?\n\nBut note: we don't control the **objectively optimal** strategy \u2014 we can only incentivize behavior through the contract.\n\nIdea: **Use the contract to create a symmetric incentive for cooperation**, even though the base game is zero-sum.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose we design a contract where:\n- If you play A0, you get +c points (paid by opponent)\n- If you play A1, you get -c points (you pay c to opponent)\n\nBut this is asymmetric \u2014 you're making yourself better off only when choosing A0.\n\nBut the other player might reject this.\n\nAlternatively, think of a **symmetric, stabilizing contract**: One that rewards matching actions.\n\nBut observe: the base game rewards **matching actions** (both A0 or both A1 \u2192 +1 for you), and punishes mismatching.\n\nSo **both players want to match**, but they don\u2019t know what the other will do.\n\n\u2192 **This is a coordination problem with conflict of interest**, but still symmetric.\n\nSo perhaps we can **reward coordination** and **punish deviation**?\n\nBut note: in matching pennies, the optimal strategy is to randomize 50-50 \u2014 **not to coordinate**.\n\nHowever, if we add a contract that **makes coordination beneficial**, we could shift outcomes.\n\nBut players might still prefer to defect.\n\nWait \u2014 here's a **crucial idea**:\n\nSuppose we design a contract that makes **both players gain if they both play A0**, or both play A1, but lose if they differ.\n\nBut in the base game, matching is already better.\n\nSo why would need a contract?\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: in the base game, both players **have no incentive to coordinate** \u2014 they both prefer to **randomize**, because if they both play A0, the other player can exploit them by playing A1.\n\nSo in the absence of a contract, the equilibrium is symmetric randomization.\n\nBut suppose we **add a contract that rewards coordination**?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose we design a **symmetric contract**: both players get +1 if both play the same action, and -1 if they differ.\n\nThen, the entire game becomes:\n- Base payoff: if same \u2192 +1, if different \u2192 -1\n- Contract: if same \u2192 +1, if different \u2192 -1\n\nTotal payoff: if same \u2192 +2, if different \u2192 -2\n\nThis is exactly **coordination game** with pure strategy equilibria at (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).\n\nNow both players would want to coordinate \u2014 so both would play A0, or both A1.\n\nBut how do they decide? They could coordinate on A0, for example.\n\nBut now, **the contract must be a function of your own action**, not the joint outcome.\n\n> Critical: **The contract specifies how much you get based only on your action, not on what the other player does.**\n\nSo we **cannot** write a contract that gives +1 if both play same \u2014 because that depends on the **other player\u2019s action**, and the contract must specify payout **for each action you take**.\n\nSo contract must be of the form:\n- For your action A0: you get X extra points\n- For your action A1: you get Y extra points\n\nAnd these are **fixed**, independent of what the other player does.\n\nSo we **cannot** base the contract on joint outcome.\n\nThat limits our options.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Can We Use the Contract to \"Fix\" the Game?**\n\nLet\u2019s suppose we can **restructure the incentives** by adding money from one player to the other.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose we propose:\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": -1}\n```\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n- If you play A0 \u2192 you get +1 (paid by opponent)\n- If you play A1 \u2192 you get -1 (you pay 1 to opponent)\n\nSo this rewards playing A0 and penalizes A1.\n\nBut now, in equilibrium, you\u2019d want to play A0 as much as possible \u2014 but if the other player is best responding, they might play A1 to exploit you.\n\nWait \u2014 this changes the **incentives**, but how?\n\nLet\u2019s try to compute what the other player would do if you play this contract.\n\nBut we need to **design a contract that both players accept**.\n\nSo suppose you propose:\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": -1}\n```\n\nThen you\u2019re saying: \u201cI\u2019ll give you 1 extra point for playing A0, and take 1 extra point from you for playing A1.\u201d\n\nBut you\u2019re offering to **subsidize A0**.\n\nNow consider the other player\u2019s view.\n\nThey know:\n- If they play A0, they get +1 from you (via contract).\n- If they play A1, they get -1 from you (they pay you 1).\n\nSo they **strongly prefer A0**.\n\nThus, they will play A0 with probability 1.\n\nNow, what do you do?\n\nIf you play A0, you get:\n- Base: 1 (since other plays A0)\n- Contract: +1 \u2192 total: 2\n\nIf you play A1, you get:\n- Base: -1 (other plays A0)\n- Contract: -1 \u2192 total: -2\n\nSo you strongly prefer A0.\n\nSo both players play A0 \u2192 payoffs:\n- You: 1 (base) + 1 (contract) = 2\n- Opponent: -1 (base) + 1 (contract) = 0\n\nSo both get more than 0? Wait \u2014 **you get 2**, opponent gets 0.\n\nBut opponent gets 0, which is better than the Nash equilibrium 0, so they are **indifferent**.\n\nBut: player 2 gets -1 from base game, +1 from contract \u2192 net 0.\n\nAnd the Nash equilibrium is 0, so they are **at least as well off**.\n\nSo they **accept** the contract.\n\nBut wait \u2014 do they get **more**? No, same.\n\nBut they **don\u2019t lose**, so they are indifferent \u2014 could accept.\n\nBut can we make it strictly better?\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1.5, \"A1\": -1.5}\n```\n\nThen if opponent plays A0:\n- You get: base 1 + contract 1.5 = 2.5\n- Opponent gets: base -1 + contract 1.5 = 0.5 > 0\n\nSo opponent gets **0.5**, which is better than 0.\n\nSo they **prefer** to accept.\n\nYou get 2.5 \u2192 much better.\n\nBut is this **incentive compatible**?\n\nOpponent still wants to play A0 (because if they play A1, they get:\n- Base: 1 (since you play A0) \u2192 but your action is A0, so if they play A1, base payoff is -1\n- Contract: A1 \u2192 -1.5 \u2192 so total: -1 + (-1.5) = -2.5\n- vs. A0: -1 + 1.5 = 0.5\n\nSo yes, opponent plays A0.\n\nYou, knowing this, prefer A0 \u2192 get 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 vs. -1 + (-1.5) = -2.5\n\nSo both play A0 \u2192 you get 2.5, opponent gets 0.5\n\nBut now, the contract is **not symmetric**, and we are **effectively subsidizing coordination on A0**.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWait \u2014 what if we **flip**?\n\nSuppose we try to **reward A1**?\n\n```json\n{\"A0\": -1, \"A1\": 1}\n```\n\nThen you reward A1, punish A0.\n\nSame logic: opponent will play A1 \u2192 you also play A1 \u2192 you get 1 + 1 = 2, opponent gets -1 + 1 = 0\n\nSame outcome.\n\nSo symmetric.\n\nBut we can do this *only* if both players accept the contract.\n\nBut now consider: if player 2 sees this contract, they see:\n- If they play A0: get -1 from contract\n- If they play A1: get +1 from contract\n\u2192 they prefer A1\n\nAnd since you prefer A1 (because it gives you +1 in contract, and matching A1 in base gives you 1), both play A1.\n\nSo either A0 or A1 can be coordinated on, depending on the contract.\n\nBut we want **both players to accept the contract**, and **we want high payoff for us**.\n\nSo which contract is best?\n\nBut note: **the contract must be acceptable to both players**.\n\nSo if you propose {\"A0\": +1, \"A1\": -1}, then:\n- You get +1 if you play A0\n- The other player gets +1 if they play A0 (because you pay them)\n\nBut wait \u2014 no: the **contract terms are from your perspective**.\n\nWait: key point!\n\nThe contract defines **your extra payoff** based on **your action**.\n\nBut it also **affects the other player**: when you get +1 for A0, it's **from the other player's pocket** \u2014 **they lose 1**.\n\nSo in contract {\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": -1}:\n- You receive +1 when you play A0 \u2192 opponent pays you 1\n- You pay 1 when you play A1 \u2192 opponent receives 1\n\nSo the **net transfer** is symmetric: all money flows from opponent to you, based on your action.\n\nNow: if both players accept, and act rationally, what happens?\n\nSuppose you propose:\n```json\n{\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": -1}\n```\n\nThen, the other player sees:\n- If they play A0: they lose 1 (because you get +1)\n- If they play A1: they gain 1 (because you pay 1)\n\nSo they **prefer A1**.\n\nNow you: if you play A0: you gain 1 (contract), but base = -1 (since opponent plays A1) \u2192 total: 0\nIf you play A1: contract = -1, base = 1 (since opponent plays A1) \u2192 total: 0\n\nSo you're indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nBut now there\u2019s **no incentive to coordinate** \u2014 you get 0 no matter what.\n\nThe contract didn\u2019t help.\n\nAh! **We made a mistake**.\n\nThe **other player** will not play A0 \u2014 they prefer A1 because they gain from A1.\n\nSo if they play A1, then:\n- If you play A0: base = -1 (you lose), contract = +1 \u2192 total = 0\n- If you play A1: base = 1, contract = -1 \u2192 total = 0\n\nSo you're indifferent \u2014 no incentive to play A0.\n\nBut the other player wants to play A1 because they gain 1 from contract.\n\nSo both will play A1 \u2192 you get 0.\n\nBut in the Nash equilibrium without contract, you get 0.\n\nSo **this contract doesn\u2019t improve your payoff**, and the other player might reject it because they\u2019re not better off? Wait \u2014 no:\n\n- If other player plays A1, they gain 1 from contract.\n- In base game, since you play A1 (you\u2019re indifferent), they get 1 (base) + 1 (contract) = 2\n\nWait! You\u2019re not forcing them to play A1 \u2014 they **choose** to play A1 because it gives them +1 in contract.\n\nAnd you\u2019re indifferent \u2014 so you might play A1 too?\n\nBut in this case, if you play A1, you get:\n- Base: 1 (since they play A1)\n- Contract: -1 \u2192 total: 0\n\nOpponent: base: -1, contract: +1 \u2192 total: 0\n\nWait \u2014 no! If they play A1, and you play A1, then:\n- Your base payoff: 1\n- Your contract: -1 \u2192 total: 0\n- Their base: -1\n- Their contract: +1 \u2192 total: 0\n\nSo both get 0 \u2014 **same as no contract**.\n\nBut the opponent **could have** gotten more if they played A0?\n\nWait \u2014 **no**, if you play A0, they get:\n- Base: -1 (you played A0, they played A1 \u2192 you get -1)\n- Contract: +1 (because you play A0 \u2192 you get +1, so they lose 1)\n\nWait \u2014 no: **contract is paid per action of the player**.\n\nWhen the **other player** plays A1, they get **+1** from you.\n\nWhen **you** play A0, you get **+1** from them.\n\nSo if you play A0, and they play A1:\n- You: base -1, contract +1 \u2192 total 0\n- They: base 1, contract +1 \u2192 total 2\n\nSo they get 2.\n\nBut now, you get 0.\n\nBut you are indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nSo you might as well play A1 \u2014 then you get:\n- Base: 1\n- Contract: -1 \u2192 0\n\nSame.\n\nBut if they play A1, and you play A0 \u2014 you get 0.\n\nThey get 2.\n\nBut they prefer that.\n\nBut **you** are indifferent \u2014 so you might choose randomly.\n\nBut still, both players get 0 on average.\n\nSo **neither gets better than 0**.\n\nBut the opponent gets **2 if you play A0**, but only **0 if you play A1**.\n\nSo if they play A1, and you play A1, they get 0.\n\nBut if you play A0, they get 2.\n\nSo why would they play A1? Because in the contract, playing A1 gives them +1 **no matter what**.\n\nBut the base game depends on your move.\n\nNow, if you play A0, they get 1 (from base) + 1 (contract) = 2\n\nIf you play A1, they get -1 (base) + 1 (contract) = 0\n\nSo they want **you to play A0**.\n\nBut **to get this**, they need to play A1, and you need to play A0.\n\nBut if you play A0, you get:\n- Base: -1\n- Contract: +1 \u2192 0\n\nIf you play A1, you get:\n- Base: 1\n- Contract: -1 \u2192 0\n\nSo you're indifferent.\n\nBut the **only way for them to get high payoff** is to get you to play A0.\n\nBut they can't control that.\n\nSo they are indifferent about your action.\n\nBut their **contract payoff is always +1** if they play A1.\n\nSo they play A1.\n\nYou, indifferent, might play A0 or A1.\n\nBut since you prefer to maximize your **expected** payoff, and you're indifferent, you might play A1.\n\nSo equilibrium: both play A1 \u2192 both get 0.\n\nOr if you play A0, opponent gets 2, you get 0.\n\nBut since you're indifferent, you might play A1.\n\nSo in equilibrium, both get 0.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Try a Symmetric Contract**\n\nWhat if we propose a contract that **symmetrically rewards the same action**?\n\nBut we can\u2019t \u2014 because the contract must be in terms of your **own action**, not",

    "response": "Let\u2019s break this down step by step to determine the optimal contract to propose, keeping in mind that:\n\n- You are **Player 2**.\n- The goal is to **maximize your total points**, considering both the base game payoffs and any additional contract payments.\n- A contract can be proposed by either player, but **only one contract will be active**, chosen via **approval voting** (random tie-break among those with maximum approvals).\n- Both players can choose to **accept or reject** a contract.\n- The contract only activates if **both accept it**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base Game\n\nThe base game payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):\n\n|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| P2: A0    | (1, -1) | (-1, 1) |\n| P2: A1    | (-1, 1) | (1, -1) |\n\nSo:\n- If both play A0 \u2192 you get 1, opponent gets -1\n- If both play A1 \u2192 you get 1, opponent gets -1\n- If you play A0, opponent plays A1 \u2192 you get -1, opponent gets 1\n- If you play A1, opponent plays A0 \u2192 you get -1, opponent gets 1\n\nThis is a **pure coordination game with a twist**: same outcomes for (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) \u2014 you gain 1, opponent loses 1. But in mismatched cases, you lose 1 and opponent gains 1.\n\nWait \u2014 actually, let's recheck:\n\n- (A0,A0): (1, -1) \u2192 you get 1, other gets -1\n- (A0,A1): (-1, 1) \u2192 you get -1, other gets 1\n- (A1,A0): (-1, 1) \u2192 you get -1, other gets 1\n- (A1,A1): (1, -1) \u2192 you get 1, other gets -1\n\nSo regardless of actions, **if you match your opponent's choice, you gain 1, they lose 1. If you mismatch, you lose 1, they gain 1.**\n\nHence, this is a **symmetric coordination game with an incentive to coordinate on the same action**, but only **because identical actions give a positive outcome to the player**, while mismatches hurt them.\n\nBut notice: the outcome depends *only* on whether actions are the same or different.\n\nSo:\n- Same action \u2192 you get +1, opponent gets -1\n- Different actions \u2192 you get -1, opponent gets +1\n\nThis is equivalent to a **\"matching pennies\"** variant \u2014 but **not** zero-sum in the standard sense.\n\nActually, let's add up the total payoff across both players:\n- Same: 1 + (-1) = 0\n- Different: -1 + 1 = 0\n\nSo overall, **total payoff is always zero**. This is **zero-sum**.\n\nTherefore, the game is symmetric and zero-sum: what one player gains, the other loses.\n\nIn such games, rational players typically consider mixed strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find Nash Equilibrium (in the base game)\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n- You (P2) play A0 with probability p\n- Opponent (P1) plays A0 with probability q\n\nYour expected payoff for choosing A0:\n- If P1 plays A0 (prob q): you get 1\n- If P1 plays A1 (prob 1-q): you get -1\n\u2192 E[A0] = q(1) + (1\u2212q)(\u22121) = q \u2212 (1\u2212q) = 2q \u2212 1\n\nYour expected payoff for choosing A1:\n- If P1 plays A0 (q): you get -1\n- If P1 plays A1 (1\u2212q): you get 1\n\u2192 E[A1] = q(\u22121) + (1\u2212q)(1) = \u2212q + 1 \u2212 q = 1 \u2212 2q\n\nFor indifference (best response), set E[A0] = E[A1]:\n2q \u2212 1 = 1 \u2212 2q  \n4q = 2 \u2192 q = 0.5\n\nSimilarly, from the opponent\u2019s perspective, symmetry implies they also play 50% A0, 50% A1.\n\nSo **the unique mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium is both players playing A0 and A1 each with 50% probability.**\n\nIn that case:\n- Expected payoff:\n  - Both same: prob = 0.5 \u2192 you get +1\n  - Both different: prob = 0.5 \u2192 you get -1\n  \u2192 Your expected payoff: 0.5(1) + 0.5(-1) = 0\n\nSo in equilibrium, **you expect to get 0 points from the base game**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Introduce the Contract\n\nNow, we can **propose a contract** that adds extra payoffs based on the action taken.\n\nKey rules:\n- You propose a contract: two values, one for A0, one for A1.\n- The contract specifies: if you play A0, you get extra `c0` points (if positive) or pay `-c0` (if negative), paid to the other player.\n- Similarly for A1.\n- Only active if **both agree to accept** it.\n\nImportant: The contract **adds or subtracts** from your total payout, and this payment is drawn equally from the other player(s). So:\n- If your contract says \"A0: +5\", then you receive +5 from the other player, who loses 5.\n- If your contract says \"A0: -3\", then you pay 3 to the other player (they gain 3).\n\nThese are **additional payoffs**, independent of the base game.\n\nSo your **total payoff in game** = base game payoff + contract payoff for your chosen action.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Designing a Contract That Maximizes Your Expected Payoff\n\nWe want to design a contract that:\n1. Is **likely to be accepted** by the other player.\n2. Leads to **high expected payoff for you**, when combined with the base game outcomes.\n3. Since **only contracts with max approval win**, and selection is random among tied top approvals, **we don\u2019t need to dominate all others**\u2014we just need our contract to be **as attractive as possible** and **accepted by the other player**.\n\nBut note: because you are proposing it, and you must **get their acceptance**, you cannot force them to accept.\n\nSo we must **design a contract that is beneficial enough for the other player** that they\u2019d want to accept it, while still being good for us.\n\nLet\u2019s think about incentives.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Strategic Thinking \u2013 What Would the Other Player Want?\n\nFrom their perspective:\n- They want to **maximize their own total points**.\n- Since they\u2019re rational, they\u2019ll compare: \u201cIf I accept this contract, will I do better overall?\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ll assess your proposal and decide based on expected value under their best strategy, given your contract.\n\nSo we must **offer them something** that makes accepting beneficial, even though we're designing the contract.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Idea \u2013 Encourage Coordination?\n\nBut remember: the base game already rewards coordination (same actions), so **the equilibrium structure is stable at 50-50**.\n\nHowever, **if we can shift behavior toward full coordination**, we could improve outcomes.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: the base game is **zero-sum**, so no matter what, total sum of points is zero. Any gain for you is lost by the opponent.\n\nThus, **any change in strategy that increases your expected payoff must decrease theirs**, unless we introduce a contract that **changes the incentives in a way that benefits both**.\n\nWait \u2014 can we make the **contract increase total surplus**?\n\nNo: contracts just redistribute money between players.\n\nIn fact, **the contract doesn't change total points** \u2014 it only shifts them.\n\nBut here\u2019s a key insight: **a contract can influence what actions players pick** \u2014 even if the base game is zero-sum.\n\nBecause now, the **effective payoff** includes contract terms.\n\nSo even though the base game is zero-sum, the **contract changes which actions are incentivized**.\n\nWe might be able to **alter the equilibrium** to our benefit.\n\nLet me formalize.\n\nSuppose:\n- You propose: {\"A0\": X, \"A1\": Y}\n\nThen, your **effective payoff** for playing A0 is: base payoff + X\nSimilarly, for A1: base payoff + Y\n\nBut base payoff depends on opponent\u2019s action.\n\nYou want to **influence the opponent** to choose a certain action, or **align your own incentives**.\n\nBut since you are **proposing the contract**, and **the opponent decides whether to accept**, you must make it so that:\n- The opponent finds it worthwhile to accept (i.e., believes they'll do better than without the contract).\n- Yet, **your expected payoff is maximized**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Try to Incentivize a Specific Outcome\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you want to **encourage everyone to play A0**.\n\nWhy? Because if you both play A0, you get 1 point (plus any contract bonus).\n\nBut currently, in equilibrium, each of you is indifferent between A0 and A1, due to 50-50 mix.\n\nSo how can we **make A0 more attractive**?\n\nBut remember: your contract affects **only your own extra reward**, not the opponent\u2019s.\n\nSo you can offer yourself something.\n\nBut if you say: A0: +5, A1: 0 \u2192 Then you gain more if you play A0.\n\nBut the opponent sees: \u201cI\u2019m not getting anything extra from your contract \u2014 unless I play A0, and even then nothing.\u201d\n\nSo they have no incentive to change behavior.\n\nUnless... you **give them an incentive too**?\n\nWait \u2014 the contract is **on you only**? No.\n\nClarify: When you propose a contract, you specify:\n- For your action A0: you get +X or pay -X\n- For your action A1: you get +Y or pay -Y\n\nAnd this money is **drawn from or paid to the other player**.\n\nSo: **you are paying or receiving money based on your own action**.\n\nThis means:\n- **You determine how much you pay/receive depending on what you do**\n- **Your payoff is changed accordingly**\n- The other player **is affected passively** \u2014 they gain/lose the amount you pay/receive\n\nSo if you say \"A0: +10\", you get +10, opponent loses 10 \u2014 regardless of their action.\n\nBut does this affect **their decision-making**?\n\nYes \u2014 because the effective total payoff (including contract) matters for their calculation.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify: when evaluating whether to accept your contract, the other player will consider:\n- What their expected payoff would be under the contract (vs. not having one)\n- And whether their best response is better than before.\n\nBut **your contract changes the total payoff**, so it can change their optimal strategy.\n\nFor example, suppose you propose: A0: +2, A1: -2\n\nThat means:\n- If you play A0 \u2192 you gain 2, opponent loses 2\n- If you play A1 \u2192 you lose 2, opponent gains 2\n\nSo **it benefits the opponent if you choose A0**, hurts them if you choose A1.\n\nTherefore, from the **opponent\u2019s perspective**, they prefer you to play A0, because that causes them to gain 2 points (via the contract, even though your action might lead to bad base payoff).\n\nBut wait \u2014 the **base payoff depends on joint action**.\n\nExample:\n- Suppose opponent plays A0.\n  - If you play A0 \u2192 base: you get 1, they get -1; plus contract: +2 \u2192 your total: 3, opponent: -1 -2 = -3\n  - If you play A1 \u2192 base: you get -1, they get 1; plus contract: -2 \u2192 your total: -3, opponent: 1 + 2 = 3\n\nSo opponent would prefer you to play A0 \u2014 because then they get -3 vs 3.\n\nWait \u2014 no! They get **-3** in first case, **+3** in second.\n\nSo they prefer **you to play A1**, because that gives them **+3**, vs only **-3** if you play A0.\n\nBut you\u2019re giving them money **when you play A1** (since you pay \u20132), but base game gives them 1 when you play A1.\n\nSo yes \u2014 opponent prefers you to play A1.\n\nBut we don\u2019t care what they prefer \u2014 we care whether they\u2019d **want to accept the contract**.\n\nSo should they accept?\n\nLet\u2019s go back.\n\nSuppose without any contract, equilibrium yields 0 expected payoff.\n\nWith your proposed contract: {\"A0\": +2, \"A1\": -2}\n\nWhat happens?\n\n- You are incentivized to play A0 (gain +2) rather than A1 (lose -2).\n- Opponent wants to play A1 (because if you play A0 \u2192 they get -1 [base] -2 [from contract] = -3; if you play A1 \u2192 they get +1 +2 = +3 \u2192 better).\n\nSo equilibrium would be you play A0, opponent plays A1 \u2192 mismatch \u2192 base payoff: -1 for you, +1 for them.\n\nPlus contract: you pay -2 \u2192 total: -1 -2 = -3  \nOpponent: +1 +2 = +3\n\nBut **without contract**, in equilibrium, expected payoff is 0.\n\nSo **opponent gets +3**, which is **better than 0**.\n\nBut **you get -3**, worse than 0.\n\nBut **you\u2019re offering the contract** \u2014 so you can afford to lose in some cases?\n\nNo \u2014 in this case, **the contract may be accepted**, but only because **the other player benefits** \u2014 but you lose big.\n\nSo not good.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps we can reverse it.\n\nHow about: {\"A0\": -2, \"A1\": +2}\n\nThen:\n- You lose 2 if you play A0\n- You gain 2 if you play A1\n\nSo you prefer to play A1.\n\nOpponent:\n- If you play A0 \u2192 they get -1 +2 (because you pay them) = +1\n- If you play A1 \u2192 they get +1 -2 = -1\n\nSo opponent wants **you to play A0** (then they get +1), not A1 (then -1).\n\nBut your best action is A1.\n\nSo if you play A1 \u2192 outcome: mismatch \u2192 base: you get -1, they get +1\nContract: you get +2 \u2192 total: +1; opponent: +1 -2 = -1\n\nWithout contract: expected 0.\n\nOpponent gets -1 \u2014 worse than 0.\n\nSo they would **not want to accept** this contract.\n\nSo neither contract works well.\n\nWe need a contract that:\n- Makes the **other player better off** when they accept\n- While **still allowing us to do well**\n\nBut the contract only affects **our own payoff based on our action**, so:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Let c0 = payment to self if playing A0 (so cost to other player)\n- c1 = payment to self if playing A1\n\nThen:\n- When you play A0, you get c0, opponent loses c0\n- When you play A1, you get c1, opponent loses c1\n\nSo your total payoff = base payoff + c_action\n\nOpponent's total payoff = base payoff \u2212 c_action\n\nNow, suppose we know the other player will play optimally after the contract is accepted.\n\nSo we can model it as a modified game.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose we propose a contract: {\"A0\": c0, \"A1\": c1}\n\nThen the new payoff matrix becomes:\n\n|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| P2: A0    | (1+c0, -1\u2212c0) | (-1+c0, 1\u2212c0) |\n| P2: A1    | (-1+c1, 1\u2212c1) | (1+c1, -1\u2212c1) |\n\nWe can compute the expected equilibrium under this modified game.\n\nBut since both players will adjust their behavior, **we need to compute the Nash equilibrium** of the modified game, then see your expected payoff, and check whether the opponent finds it acceptable.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll propose \u2014 we just know we must make a **proposal that they\u2019ll want to accept**, i.e., their expected payoff \u2265 what they\u2019d get without a contract.\n\nAssume that **without contract**, they get 0 (the standard Nash eq).\n\nSo for their **expected payoff under contract to be \u2265 0**, they must be happy.\n\nOur goal: maximize **our** expected payoff, subject to their expected payoff \u2265 0.\n\nNow, let\u2019s try to **find contract values** that make both players better off.\n\nCan we make **coordinating** favorable?\n\nSuppose we want both to play A0.\n\nTo make A0 desirable for both, we can **reward A0**.\n\nBut **only one side can be rewarded per action**.\n\nWait \u2014 if we set c0 = +k, c1 = 0\n\nThen:\n- You like A0 (get +k), dislike A1 (no extra gain)\n- Opponent dislikes you playing A0, because they lose k\n- Opponent likes you playing A1, because they gain 0 (if you play A1, you get 0, so they get nothing extra)\n\nSo opponent wants you to play A1.\n\nBut you want to play A0.\n\nSo conflict.\n\nAlternatively, if we set c0 = 0, c1 = +k\n\nThen you want A1, opponent wants you to play A0.\n\nAgain, conflict.\n\nWhat if both actions get the same reward?\n\nSay c0 = c1 = +k\n\nThen:\n- You gain +k regardless of action \u2192 you\u2019re indifferent\n- Opponent loses k regardless of your action \u2192 so they are hurt no matter what\n\nSo they'd never accept this \u2014 losing k every time.\n\nSimilarly, c0 = c1 = -k \u2192 you lose k always \u2192 bad for you.\n\nSo asymmetric contract is needed.\n\nWait \u2014 how about making the contract **punish deviations from coordination**?\n\nAlternative idea: **Use a contract to enforce cooperation**.\n\nSuppose we propose: {\"A0\": +1, \"A1\": -1}\n\nThen:\n- If you play A0, you get +1\n- If you play A1, you lose 1\n\nSo you prefer A0.\n\nOpponent:\n- If you play A0 \u2192 they lose 1\n- If you play A1 \u2192 they gain 1\n\nSo they prefer you play A1.\n\nConflict again.\n\nBut notice: if you play A0, you get +1, but base payoff depends on their action.\nIf they play A0 \u2192 base: 1 \u2192 total: 1+1=2\nIf they play A1 \u2192 base: -1 \u2192 total: -1+1=0\n\nIf you play A1 \u2192 base: \u00b11 \u2192 total: \u00b11 -1\n\nSo your best response:\n- Against A0: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 0 \u2192 prefer A0\n- Against A1: A0 gives 0, A1 gives 0 \u2192 indifferent\n\nSo likely you play A0.\n\nOpponent:\n- If you play A0 \u2192 they get -1 -1 = -2 (base -1, contract loss 1)\n- If you play A1 \u2192 they get +1 +1 = +2 (base +1, contract gain 1)\n\nSo they prefer you to play A1.\n\nBut they don\u2019t control your action.\n\nSo if they play A0, you get 2 (if you play A0) \u2192 you play A0 \u2192 total: (A0,A0) \u2192 both get: you: 2, them: -2\n\nIf they play A1, you play A0 (because better than A1), outcome: (A0,A1) \u2192 you: 0, them: +2\n\nSo your expected payoff depends.\n\nBut they want to get +2, so they prefer to play A1.\n\nBut if they play A1, you play A0 \u2192 they get +2\n\nIs that better than without contract? Yes \u2014 because without contract, they get 0.\n\nSo they'd want to accept the contract.\n\nBut what do you get?\n- If you play A0, you get: base +1 (A0) + contract +1 = total 2\n- But if they play A1, your base is -1, so total: -1 +1 = 0\n\nBut they play A1 because they believe it leads to you playing A0.\n\nBut do they believe that? Yes.\n\nSo in this case, under contract, the equilibrium is:\n- Opponent plays A1 (to get +2)\n- You play A0 (because A0 gives 2 against A0, 0 against A1 \u2192 so better to play A0)\n- Result: (A0,A1) \u2192 base: you -1, contract: +1 \u2192 total: 0\n   opponent: +1 -1 = 0? Wait no:\n\nWait \u2014 opponent plays A1 \u2192 you play A0 \u2192 base: you get -1, opponent gets +1\nContract: you played A0 \u2192 you get +1 \u2192 total: -1 +1 = 0\nOpponent: +1 (base) -1 (loss from contract) = 0\n\nSo both get 0.\n\nWithout contract, they also get 0.\n\nSo they are indifferent to accepting.\n\nBut you also get 0.\n\nNo gain.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nWhat if we set c0 = +2, c1 = +2?\n\nThen you get +2 always.\n\nOpponent loses 2 always.\n\nSo they get worst-case.\n\nNot acceptable.\n\nWhat if we set c0 = +2, c1 = 0\n\nThen:\n- You prefer A0 (get +2), dislike A1 (0)\n- Opponent dislikes you playing A0 (loses 2), likes you playing A1 (gains 0)\n\nSo you play A0.\nOpponent wants you to play A1 \u2192 so they play A1.\n\nOutcome: (A0,A1) \u2192 base: you -1, contract: +2 \u2192 total: +1\nOpponent: +1 -2 = -1\n\nSo you get +1, they get -1.\n\nCompared to no contract (0), you gain 1, they lose 1.\n\nSo they will **reject** \u2014 they\u2019d rather keep 0 than get -1.\n\nNot good.\n\nBut suppose we set c0 = +1, c1 = +1\n\nYou get +1 regardless.\n\nOpponent loses 1 regardless.\n\nThey get -1 always \u2192 worse than 0 \u2192 reject.\n\nSame issue.\n\nHow to make opponent accept?\n\nThey need to see **improvement** in their expected payoff.\n\nSo we must **increase their expected payoff** above 0.\n\nBut if we give them money **when you play A1**, they gain.\n\nOr if you play A0, they lose.\n\nSo to help them, we must make them gain when you do something.\n\nBut you want to **avoid that if you don't gain**.\n\nBest bet: **make your preferred action benefit the opponent**.\n\nBut when you play A0, opponent loses \u2192 bad for them.\n\nWhen you play A1, opponent wins.\n\nSo if we make **we prefer A1**, then opponent likes it.\n\nSo let\u2019s try: you propose {\"A0\": -1, \"A1\": +1}\n\nThen:\n- You lose 1 if you play A0\n- You gain 1 if you play A1\n\nSo you prefer A1.\n\nOpponent:\n- If you play A0 \u2192 they gain 1 (from contract)\n- If you play A1 \u2192 they lose 1\n\nSo they prefer you to play A0.\n\nSo we have a conflict.\n\nBut what happens if both play A0?\n\nCheck best responses.\n\nSuppose opponent plays A0.\n- You: A0 \u2192 base -1, contract -1 \u2192 total: -2\n- A1 \u2192 base +1, contract +1 \u2192 total: +2\n\u2192 you prefer A1\n\nSo you play A1.\n\nOutcome: (A1,A0) \u2192 base: -1 for you, +1 for them\nContract: you play A1 \u2192 you get +1 \u2192 total: 0\nOpponent: +1 -1 = 0\n\nIf opponent plays A1:\n- You: A0 \u2192 -1 -1 = -2; A1 \u2192 +1 +1 = +2 \u2192 prefer A1\n- So you play A1\n- Outcome: (A1,A1) \u2192 base: you 1, contract +1 \u2192 total 2\n   opponent: -1 -1 = -2\n\nSo your best response is A1 regardless.\n\nOpponent's best response:\n- If you play A1, they get either:\n   - If they play A0: +1 -1 = 0\n   - If they play A1: -1 -1 = -2\n   \u2192 prefer A0\n\n- If you play A0: you play A1 (as shown), opp: \n   - play A0: +1 -1 = 0\n   - play A1: -1 -1 = -2 \u2192 prefer A0\n\nSo opponent always plays A0.\n\nYou always play A1.\n\nOutcome: (A1,A0) \u2192 your total: base -1 + contract +1 = 0\nOpponent: base +1 + contract -1 = 0\n\nSo both get 0.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nStill not helpful.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight: To make the other player accept, we need their expected payoff > 0.\n\nBut without contract, they get 0.\n\nSo we must make it so that under contract, they get more than 0.\n\nHow?\n\nWe can **let them gain money by coordinating**.\n\nSuppose we propose: {\"A0\": +1, \"A1\": +1}\n\nThen you get +1 regardless.\n\nOpponent loses 1 regardless.\n\nWorse for them.\n\nNo.\n\nSuppose we propose: {\"A0\": +1, \"A1\": +1} \u2014 no, same.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we do the **opposite**?\n\nTry: {\"A0\": -1, \"A1\": -1}\n\nThen you lose 1 regardless \u2192 bad for you.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, can we use a contract that encourages coordination, but in a way that benefits both?\n\nBut the base game already has symmetry \u2014 only difference is in coordination.\n\nAh!\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a thought: **if both players play the same action, you both get +1 and -1 respectively.**\n\nSo if we could make both prefer to play the same, but **only in a way that the contract makes it better**.\n\nBut since the contract only goes to one person, hard to align.\n\nBetter idea:\n\n### Propose a contract that makes you indifferent between A0 and A1, but creates a situation where coordination is stable and beneficial.\n\nBut recall: you are trying to **maximize your payoff**, and you can only set your own incentives.\n\nFinal idea: **Make the contract such that the outcome becomes (A0,A0)** with high probability, and you are rewarded.\n\nHow?\n\nSuppose you want (A0,A0) to happen.\n\nThen you get 1 + contract_bonus.\n\nBut your contract can make you want A0.\n\nSet c0 = +k, c1 = 0.\n\nThen you prefer A0.\n\nOpponent wants you to play A1 (because they lose if you play A0).\n\nSo they play A1.\n\nResult: (A0,A1) \u2192 you get -1 + k, they get +1 - k.\n\nFor opponent to accept: they must get >= 0.\n\nSo: +1 - k >= 0 \u2192 k <= 1\n\nYou get: -1 + k\n\nMaximized when k=1 \u2192 you get 0\n\nOppo gets: +1 -1 = 0\n\nSo they are indifferent.\n\nAcceptance possible.\n\nBut you get 0 \u2014 same as baseline.\n\nNo gain.\n\nWhat if you set c0 = +1, c1 = -1\n\nYou prefer A0 (get +1), avoid A1 (lose 1)\n\nOpponent wants you to play A1 (gains 1), but you won\u2019t.\n\nSo they play A1.\n\nYou play A0.\n\nResult: (A0,A1) \u2192 you: -1 +1 = 0, opponent: +1 - (-1)? No.\n\nContract: If you play A0, you get +1, opponent loses 1.\n\nIf you play A1, you lose 1, opponent gains 1.\n\nSo when you play A0, opponent loses 1.\n\nSo outcome: you: -1 +1 = 0, opponent: +1 -1 = 0\n\nAgain 0.\n\nStill no gain.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if we set c0 = +2, c1 = +2?\n\nYou get +2 always.\n\nOpponent loses 2 always.\n\nThey get -2 < 0 \u2192 reject.\n\nNo.\n\nAfter many trials, we see that: **the contract can't make the other player better off without harming our own benefit, because the contract is only affecting our own payoff based on our action, and transfer is one-way.**\n\nBut is there a way?\n\nUnless...\n\n### Breakthrough: Make the contract such that coordinated action gives both more, but the redistribution is designed to make it palatable.\n\nBut we can't do that directly.\n\nAnother idea: **Propose a contract that punishes deviation, but in a way that you benefit.**\n\nExample: if we could make you gain more for matching, but only if they cooperate.\n\nBut not directly.\n\nFinally: **Realization: in a zero-sum game, any contract that is accepted must make the other player strictly better off, otherwise they won't accept. But you're only controlling your own payoffs.**\n\nTherefore, to make them better off, we must allow them to gain.\n\nSo the only way is to make the actions you avoid beneficial to them.\n\nSo if you want to play A0, and you don't want to punish them, you should make A0 not harmful.\n\nBut if you play A0, and you get +k, they lose k \u2014 so they suffer.\n\nUnless you set k=0.\n\nSo if you set c0 = 0, c1 = 0, then no contract, they get 0.\n\nBut you also get 0.\n\nNo gain.\n\nBut what if you set c0 = +1, c1 = +1? Then you gain 1, they lose 1 \u2014 worse for them.\n\nNo.\n\nConclusion: **It is impossible to make the other player better off in expectation without reducing your own payoff below 0, because any positive award to you requires a negative from them.**\n\nTherefore, the only possible way they'll accept is if they are **indifferent** or if the contract somehow makes coordination more likely, but in zero-sum, it's hard.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if we set c0 = 0, c1 = 0? Then contract has no effect.\n\nBut if they accept, it's neutral.\n\nSo they might accept.\n\nYou get 0.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nBut perhaps we can set c0 = -1, c1 = -1.\n\nYou lose 1.\n\nWorse for you.\n\nBad.\n\nAfter all this, the only safe contract is one where the opponent is indifferent.\n\nAnd you don't gain.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize your points.\n\nHowever, there's one possibility: \n\n### What if you propose: {\"A0\": -1, \"A1\": 1}\n\nThen:\n- You want A1 (since you gain 1 vs lose 1)\n- Opponent wants you to play A0 (because you lose 1, they gain 1)\n- So opponent plays A0\n- You play A1\n- Outcome: (A1,A0) \u2192 base: you -1, they +1\n  Contract: you play A1 \u2192 you get +1 \u2192 total: 0\n  They: +1 -1 = 0\n\nAgain 0.\n\nSame.\n\nAll paths lead to 0.\n\nBut in the original equilibrium, you also get 0.\n\nSo you can't do better than 0.\n\nBut maybe you can do better than 0 if you design wisely.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a radical idea: **set c0 = 1, c1 = -1**\n\nThen you are incentived to play A0 (+1) rather than A1 (-1).\n\nOpponent knows this, so they play A1 to avoid you playing A0.\n\nYou play A0.\n\nOutcome: (A0,A1) \u2192 your base: -1, contract: +1 \u2192 total: 0\nOpponent: +1 -1 = 0\n\nagain 0.\n\nNo progress.\n\nUnless the contract affects the equilibrium.\n\nBut in all cases, either:\n- You get 0\n- You get -1\n- Or you get +1\n\nBut when you get +1, opponent gets -1, and they reject.\n\nSo the only sustainable contract is one where opponent is at least 0.\n\nAnd that means: you get at most 0.\n\nSo maximum you can expect is 0.\n\nBut is that true?\n\nWhat if you propose: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}\n\nThen contract does nothing.\n\nEquilibrium unchanged.\n\nBoth get 0.\n\nThey might accept, because no harm.\n\nYou get 0.\n\nNo downside.\n\nAnd you might be forced to accept that.\n\nBut can you do better?\n\nAfter careful analysis, **there is no contract that allows you to expect more than 0** while the other player accepts.\n\nBecause any positive gain to you requires a loss to them, unless the contract is zero.\n\nTherefore, to maximize your expected payoff, you should propose a contract that is **neutral or slightly positive for them**, but you might still get 0.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if you propose a contract that is **exactly worth 0 for them on average**?\n\nLike c0 = 0, c1 = 0.\n\nOr c0 = 1, c1 = 1: but then they lose 1 always \u2014 bad.\n\nSo only c0 = 0, c1 = 0 is safe.\n\nBut perhaps you can propose: {\"A0\": 1, \"A1\": 1} and hope they think it's beneficial? No, they lose 1.\n\nNo.\n\nFinal realization: **in this symmetric zero-sum game, the only contract that can be accepted is one where the net transfer is 0 on average, or the other player is not harmed.**\n\nSince you control only your own payouts, the only way to not harm them is to set c0 = 0, c1 = 0.\n\nOtherwise, every choice transfers money away from them.\n\nTherefore, the only contract that is likely to be accepted is the zero contract.\n\nAnd you get 0.\n\nBut is there a contract where you gain and they gain?\n\nNo, because the contract is unilateral transfer.\n\nUnless. \n\nWhat if you propose c0 = 1, c1 = -1, but the other player is not in the transfer when they play A0? No, the contract is based on your action.\n\nI think we have to conclude:\n\n### The optimal contract is the zero contract: { \"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0 }\n\nBecause:\n- It doesn't harm the other player.\n- They have no reason to reject it.\n- We can accept it.\n- Our expected payoff is 0, which is the best we can achieve without risk of rejection.\n\nAny other contract harms them, so they reject it.\n\n Therefore, the only sustainable contract is the neutral one.\n\n So final answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": 0}",
