    "response": "To maximize my total points in this decision-making game, I first analyze the payoff matrix:\n\n- (A0, A0): Player 1 (P1) = 10, Player 2 (P2) = 10\n- (A0, A1): P1 = 0, P2 = 20\n- (A1, A0): P1 = 6, P2 = 2\n- (A1, A1): P1 = 4, P2 = 4\n\nWithout a contract, P2 has a dominant strategy to play A1, and P1's best response to A1 is A1, leading to a Nash Equilibrium of (4, 4). My objective is to propose a contract that shifts the equilibrium to a more favorable outcome for me (Player 2) while remaining attractive enough for Player 1 to accept.\n\nA contract specifies an extra payoff $x$ for action A0 and $y$ for action A1. Let $z = x - y$. The modified payoffs are:\n- (A0, A0): (10, 10)\n- (A0, A1): (z, 20 - z)\n- (A1, A0): (6 - z, 2 + z)\n- (A1, A1): (4, 4)\n\nTo maximize my payoff, I want the equilibrium to be (A0, A1), where the total points (20) are high and my share is significant. For (A0, A1) to be a Nash Equilibrium:\n1. P1 must prefer A0 over A1 when I play A1: $z > 4$.\n2. I (P2) must prefer A1 over A0 when P1 plays A0: $20 - z > 10 \\implies z < 10$.\n\nBy setting $z = 5$ (using integers), P1 gets 5 points and I get 15. Since 5 is better than the 4 points P1 would get without a contract, they are incentivized to accept. Using $x = 5$ and $y = 0$:\n\n- (A0, A0): (10, 10)\n- (A0, A1): (5, 15)\n- (A1, A0): (1, 7)\n- (A1, A1): (4, 4)\n\nIn this scenario, P1\u2019s best response to both A0 and A1 is A0 (dominant strategy). Knowing P1 will play A0, my best response is A1 (15 > 10). The equilibrium becomes (A0, A1) with a payoff of 15 for me.\n\n{\"A0\": 5, \"A1\": 0}",

Given the symmetry, it's also important to make the contract appealing enough for the other player to agree.\n\n#### Analysis on Strategies without Contract\n1. Both A0, A0 is mutual cooperation favoring equality (10, 10).\n2. You A1, other A0 is favorable to you but may not be chosen by the other (20, 0).\n3. You A0, other A1 benefits the other player too much for too little gain for you (2, 6).\n4. Both A1, A1 is less beneficial but stable (4, 4).\n\nGiven these, if both players are rational, the mutual cooperation (A0, A0) is the optimal shared payoff.\n\n#### Designing the Contract\nA contract should ideally:\n1. Maintain fairness.\n2. Correct slight imbalances to favor cooperation.\n3. Disincentivize betrayals like you choosing A1 when they choose A0.\n\n#### Proposal\nGiven the importance of cooperation and balancing, we can propose:\n- Encourage A0 by adding small rewards to A0.\n- Add penalties to A1 to discourage deviation.\n\n### Contract Definition\n```json\n{\n  \"A0\": 3,\n  \"A1\": -3\n}\n```\n- Players get additional 3 points each for choosing A0.\n- Players lose 3 points each for choosing A1.\n\n### Reasoning the Proposal\n#### Resulting Payoffs with Contract\n- **Both choose A0:**\n  - (10+3, 10+3) = (13, 13).\n- **You choose A1, other A0:**\n  - (20-3, 0+3) = (17, 3).\n- **You choose A0, other A1:**\n  - (2+3, 6-3) = (5, 3).\n- **Both choose A1:**\n  - (4-3, 4-3) = (1, 1).\n\nThis setup clearly incentivizes both players to choose A0 for maximal mutual benefit while reducing the attractiveness of stray actions.\n\n### Final Decision\n```json\n{\n  \"A0\": 3,\n  \"A1\": -3\n}\n```\n\nIn conclusion, this contract encourages both players to select A0, generating higher combined benefits and ensuring mutual cooperation.",

Let\u2019s recheck.\n\nActually, we need to compute the best response for the opponent given my strategy.\n\nLet\u2019s properly compute the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\n#### For Player 1 (me):\n- Opponent chooses A0 with probability q.\n- My expected payoff for A0: 10q + 0(1\u2212q) = 10q\n- My expected payoff for A1: 6q + 4(1\u2212q) = 6q + 4 \u2212 4q = 2q + 4\n\nI am indifferent when:  \n10q = 2q + 4 \u2192 8q = 4 \u2192 q = 0.5\n\nSo opponent must play A0 with 50% chance in NE for me to be indifferent.\n\n#### For Player 2 (opponent):\n- I play A0 with probability p.\n- Their expected payoff from A0: 10p + 2(1\u2212p) = 10p + 2 \u2212 2p = 8p + 2\n- Their expected payoff from A1: 20p + 4(1\u2212p) = 20p + 4 \u2212 4p = 16p + 4\n\nSet equal: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 \u2192 \u22128p = 2 \u2192 p = \u22120.25 \u2192 invalid\n\nWait \u2014 negative probability? That can't be.\n\nSo instead: Since the opponent has a strictly dominant strategy?\n\nCheck opponent\u2019s best response:\n\nThey prefer A1 when:\n16p + 4 > 8p + 2 \u2192 8p > \u22122 \u2192 always true since p \u2265 0.\n\nSo 16p + 4 \u2265 4, and 8p + 2 \u2264 10, but 16p + 4 is always greater than or equal to 8p + 2?\n\nAt p=0:\n- A0: 2\n- A1: 4 \u2192 A1 better\n\nAt p=1:\n- A0: 10\n- A1: 20 \u2192 A1 better\n\nSo regardless of my strategy, A1 gives higher payoff to the opponent. So **A1 is strictly dominant for the opponent**.\n\nThis changes everything.\n\n> **Conclusion**: The opponent will always play A1 (in any rational equilibrium), because it always gives them better or equal payoff than A0:\n\n- If I play A0: they get 20 (vs 10 if they played A0) \u2192 clearly prefer A1\n- If I play A1: they get 4 (vs 2) \u2192 still prefer A1\n\n\u2705 So **Best response of opponent is A1 no matter what I do.**\n\nTherefore, in the base game:\n- If I play A0 \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 I get 0\n- If I play A1 \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 I get 4\n\nSo even though A0 would give me 10 if they also played A0, they won\u2019t \u2014 because they can get more by playing A1 regardless.\n\nSo the only rational outcome is **(A1, A1)** \u2192 both get 4.\n\nWait \u2014 is that really true? Let me double-check.\n\nSuppose I play A0 \u2192 opponent gets 20 if they play A1, vs 10 if they play A0 \u2192 so yes, A1 is strictly better.\n\nSo they will **always** play A1.\n\nThus, no matter what I do, they play A1 \u2192 I get 0 if I play A0, 4 if I play A1.\n\nSo I should play A1 \u2192 guaranteed 4 points.\n\nHence, **game outcome without contracts: (A1, A1), both get 4**.\n\nSo I get 4.\n\nBut my goal is to **maximize my points** \u2014 so can I do better via a contract?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: How Can a Contract Help Me?**\n\nNow the twist: we can propose a **contract**, which adds extra payoffs based on actions.\n\n- A contract specifies for each action (A0, A1) a value (+, \u2013, or 0) indicating how much money you receive OR pay.\n- But crucially: **the contract only takes effect if both players accept**.\n- There\u2019s a \u201capproval voting\u201d process: multiple contracts could be proposed, and only one will be chosen \u2014 the one(s) with the most approvals, then randomly picked from those.\n\nSo I can propose a contract. The other player also proposes one. Then we vote on all proposals. Only the one with highest approval count wins (uniform random from max).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Strategic Thinking About Contracts**\n\nI want to **design a contract that motivates the other player to cooperate (play A0)**, so that I can benefit from the (A0,A0) outcome (10 points).\n\nBut currently, the other player **has no incentive to play A0** \u2014 because A1 is always better for them (they get 20 vs 10, or 4 vs 2).\n\nSo to make them play A0, I need to **compensate them** for choosing A0.\n\nThat is, if they play A0, I must give them **extra payoff** to offset the cost of switching from A1.\n\nHow much?\n\nIf they play A0, they get 10 in the base game (if I play A0). But if they play A1, they get 20 (if I play A0). So unless I pay them **at least 10 extra**, they\u2019ll prefer A1.\n\nBut also: what if I don\u2019t play A0?\n\nSo if I don\u2019t play A0, then playing A0 gives them 2 points, A1 gives 4 \u2192 so they still prefer A1.\n\nSo in **all cases**, playing A0 gives them less than A1 unless compensated.\n\nTo make A0 **strictly better or at least as good**, I must offer a payment that makes A0 better than A1 in every scenario.\n\nBut the contract applies per action \u2014 not conditional.\n\nThe contract says:\n- If you play A0 \u2192 you get X extra points\n- If you play A1 \u2192 you get Y extra points\n\nAnd these payments come from me (or go to me).\n\nBut note: the contract is a **transfer between players** \u2014 if I assign positive value to an action, I'm giving money to them; if I assign negative, I\u2019m paying them nothing \u2014 actually, they have to pay *to me*.\n\nThe description says:\n- Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).\n- Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).\n\nSo if I say {\"A0\": 5}, then whenever the other player plays A0, they get +5 from me \u2192 cost to me, benefit to them.\n\nIf I say {\"A0\": -5}, then when they play A0, they pay me 5 \u2192 profit to me.\n\nSo I can use this to incentivize or disincentivize behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Designing a Contract That Induces A0 From the Other Player**\n\nI want the other player to play A0.\n\nCurrently, their payoff from A1 is always better than from A0:\n\n- If I play A0: they get 20 (A1) vs 10 (A0) \u2192 difference = 10\n- If I play A1: they get 4 (A1) vs 2 (A0) \u2192 difference = 2\n\nSo to make A0 dominate A1 for them, I must increase the payoff of A0 **enough** to outweigh the loss.\n\nSpecifically:\n- In the first case (I play A0), I must make A0 worth at least 20 \u2192 so they need at least 10 extra points via contract\n- In the second case (I play A1), I must make A0 worth at least 4 \u2192 so they need at least 2 extra points via contract\n\nSo to make A0 **strictly better in both cases**, I must offer them at least 10 extra points for A0.\n\nBut I can't condition on my action!\n\nSo I must pick a fixed payment for A0 and A1.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the contract says:\n- If they play A0: they get X bonus\n- If they play A1: they get Y bonus\n\nThen their total payoff becomes:\n- A0: base + X\n- A1: base + Y\n\nWe want: A0 > A1 in both possible scenarios.\n\nWhen **I play A0**:\n- A0 \u2192 10 + X\n- A1 \u2192 20 + Y\nNeed: 10 + X \u2265 20 + Y \u2192 X \u2212 Y \u2265 10\n\nWhen **I play A1**:\n- A0 \u2192 2 + X\n- A1 \u2192 4 + Y\nNeed: 2 + X \u2265 4 + Y \u2192 X \u2212 Y \u2265 2\n\nSo the stricter condition is X \u2212 Y \u2265 10.\n\nSo to fully incentivize A0 in both cases, I need:\nX \u2212 Y \u2265 10\n\nLet\u2019s suppose I set:\n- X = 10 (give them 10 extra for A0)\n- Y = 0 (no extra for A1)\n\nThen: X\u2212Y = 10 \u2192 satisfies condition.\n\nNow, check:\n- If I play A0: they compare 10+10=20 vs 20+0=20 \u2192 equal \u2192 they may still play A1 (but indifferent). So risk: they might not switch.\n\nSo to make A0 **strictly** better, I need X\u2212Y > 10 \u2192 say X=11, Y=0 \u2192 X\u2212Y=11\n\nNow:\n- If I play A0: A0 gives 21, A1 gives 20 \u2192 A0 better\n- If I play A1: A0 gives 2+11=13, A1 gives 4+0=4 \u2192 A0 much better\n\nGreat \u2192 so now, **no matter what I do**, playing A0 is strictly better for them.\n\nSo they will play A0.\n\nThen I can play A0 too \u2192 and earn 10 \u2192 plus the contract effects.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **am I willing to pay this?**\n\nYes \u2014 if I can get 10 points from playing A0, then:\n- I pay them 11 extra points if they play A0 (because X=11 \u2192 they get +11)\n- But if I play A0, and they play A0, then:\n    - Base: 10\n    - Contract: I pay them 11 \u2192 so net for me: 10 \u2212 11 = \u22121?\n    - But wait \u2014 let's clarify.\n\nWait! Important: Who pays whom?\n\nIn the contract, \"positive number\" means the player receiving payment from the other player.\n\nSo:\n- If I design a contract with {\"A0\": 11, \"A1\": 0}, this means:\n    - When **the other player** plays A0 \u2192 they get +11 points from **me**\n    - When the other player plays A1 \u2192 they get +0 \u2192 no transfer\n\nSo **I am the one paying** 11 points **if they play A0**.\n\nSo if they play A0, I lose 11 points from the contract.\n\nBut if both play A0: base payoff is 10 for me \u2192 minus 11 for contract \u2192 net: **\u22121**\n\nToo bad.\n\nIf I set X = 0 \u2192 no payment \u2014 but then they still prefer A1.\n\nI need to **induce** them to play A0, but I want to **minimize what I pay**.\n\nCan I make it so that they get paid when they play A1? No \u2014 that would discourage A0.\n\nWhat if I **charge them** to play A1?\n\nSet {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": \u22125} \u2014 meaning: if they play A1, they pay me 5.\n\nBut that only helps if A1 is expensive \u2014 but A1 gives them 20 or 4 already, so even paying me 5, they still get 15 or \u22121 \u2192 but 15 > 2 \u2192 still better than A0 (10 or 2) \u2192 unless I charge more.\n\nBut the problem is: I cannot **force** them to play A0 unless making A0 better than A1.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to pay them to do it.\n\nAlternative idea: **let them get the reward only when they coordinate on A0**, but I don\u2019t want to pay them.\n\nWait \u2014 what if I **reward myself**? No \u2014 the contract is about transfers based on the **other player's action**, not mine.\n\nContract is defined per the **same player's action** \u2014 so it's symmetric.\n\nBut the contract I propose is **for the other player** \u2014 but the values apply to whichever player executes the action.\n\nBut in the contract, the \"player\" refers to who is making the choice.\n\nSo when I say {\"A0\": 10}, I mean: **the player who chooses A0 gets +10 from me**.\n\nBut since I am designing the contract, and I am **Player 1**, and the other player is **Player 2**, then:\n\n- \"A0\": 10 \u2192 means: **Player 2** gets +10 if **they play A0**\n- Similarly, \"A1\": anything \u2192 Player 2 gets that amount if they play A1\n\nSo I, as Player 1, am the one paying or receiving.\n\nSo if I set {\"A0\": 10, \"A1\": 0}, then:\n- When Player 2 plays A0 \u2192 I pay them 10 (cost to me)\n- When Player 2 plays A1 \u2192 I pay them 0\n\nSo I want to reduce the cost.\n\nBut I still need to make A0 strictly better for them.\n\nMinimum: X \u2212 Y \u2265 10 \u2192 so if Y = 0, need X \u2265 10\n\nSo I pay at least 10 when they play A0.\n\nBut if I set X = 10, Y = 0 \u2192 then:\n- If I play A0: they get 10 + 10 = 20 (base A0) vs 20 + 0 = 20 \u2192 tie \u2192 they might still play A1\n\nSo to get strict incentive: X = 11, Y = 0 \u2192 pay them 11 when they play A0.\n\nNow, if both play A0 \u2192 base: 10 for me, but I pay them 11 \u2192 total: 10 \u2212 11 = **\u20131** \u2192 worse than base of 4\n\nSo worse off.\n\nSo unless I can get more than 10 from base, I don\u2019t gain.\n\nBut here\u2019s a key insight: **I can propose a contract that makes A0 optimal for them, but that doesn\u2019t mean I end up playing A0 \u2014 maybe I keep playing A1**\n\nBut then if they play A0 (due to incentive), then I play A1 \u2192 I get 6 points (base), and they get 2 (base), but also:\n\n- They played A0 \u2192 I pay them 11 \u2192 so me: 6, them: 2 + 11 = 13\n\nBut I only get 6, which is better than 0, but still less than 10.\n\nBut I wanted to get 10 \u2014 but can't afford to pay 11.\n\nIs there a way to reduce pay?\n\nAlternative idea: **make the A1 penalty high enough so that A1 is not attractive**.\n\nSuppose I set:\n- {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": \u2212K}\n\nThen:\n- If they play A0: no change\n- If they play A1: they pay me K\n\nTheir payoff for A1: original \u2212 K\n\nWe want: A0 > A1 in both cases.\n\nCase 1: I play A0\n- A0: 10\n- A1: 20 \u2212 K\nWant: 10 > 20 \u2212 K \u2192 K > 10\n\nCase 2: I play A1\n- A0: 2\n- A1: 4 \u2212 K\nWant: 2 > 4 \u2212 K \u2192 K > 2\n\nSo K > 10 satisfies both.\n\nSo if I set K = 11, then:\n- If I play A0: they get 10 (A0) vs 20\u221211=9 \u2192 A0 better\n- If I play A1: they get 2 (A0) vs 4\u221211 = \u22127 \u2192 A0 better\n\nSo again, they must play A0.\n\nNow, in this contract:\n- I set {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": \u221211}\n- This means: if the other player plays A1, they pay me 11 points.\n\nPerfect \u2014 I **earn** 11 if they play A1 \u2014 but I don\u2019t want them to play A1!\n\nBut in this case, they **won\u2019t play A1** \u2014 they see it\u2019s bad.\n\nSo they play A0.\n\nNow, depending on what **I** play:\n\n- If I play A0: base 10, contract: they play A0 \u2192 no payment to them \u2192 I get 10\n- If I play A1: base 6, contract: they play A0 \u2192 no payment \u2192 I get 6\n\nSo to maximize my payoff, I should play A0 \u2192 get 10\n\nAnd I **earned 11** from them because they didn't play A1.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the contract only triggers if they play A1 \u2192 they pay me 11.\n\nBut they don\u2019t play A1 \u2192 so I don\u2019t get that 11.\n\nOnly if they play A1 do I get 11.\n\nBut they won\u2019t play A1 \u2014 because it hurts them.\n\nSo in the outcome where they play A0 (which they will), I **do not trigger the penalty** \u2192 so I don\u2019t get paid.\n\nSo my only payoff comes from base game.\n\nAnd if I play A0 \u2192 10\n\nBut I need them to play A0 \u2192 which they will, due to the contract.\n\nSo I can play A0 \u2192 get 10.\n\nIs this sustainable?\n\nYes \u2014 so final outcome:\n- Other player plays A0 (because A1 is too costly)\n- I play A0 \u2192 get 10\n\nNo payment exchanged \u2014 because they played A0 \u2192 contract doesn't penalize them (only activates on A1), and I set no reward for A0 \u2192 so zero payment.\n\nSo I get 10.\n\nBut wait \u2014 I didn\u2019t pay anyone. It\u2019s just that I threatened them: if you play A1, you lose 11, so you won\u2019t.\n\nSo I designed the contract to make A1 unattractive.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t have to pay any money.\n\nI set: {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": \u221211}\n\nThis **does not require me to pay anything** \u2014 only if they play A1, I gain 11.\n\nBut they avoid A1 \u2192 so I don\u2019t collect that.\n\nBut I still **get 10** from playing A0.\n\nCompared to the base outcome (4), this is **great**.\n\nBut \u2014 the contract must be **accepted by both players**.\n\nNow, will the **other player accept** my contract?\n\nThey are rational \u2014 and they know the outcome.\n\nThey will see: if I play A0, they get 10 \u2192 if I play A1, they get 2.\n\nBut they also see: if they play A1 \u2192 they pay me 11 \u2192 so:\n- Even if I play A0, they get 20 \u2192 but if they play A1, they pay me 11 \u2192 so net 9 \u2192 worse than 10 if they play A0\n- If I play A1, they get 4 \u2192 but if they play A1, they pay me 11 \u2192 net \u22127 \u2192 worse than 2 from A0\n\nSo they prefer A0.\n\nBut will they **accept** the contract?\n\nYes \u2014 because accepting it leads to them getting either 10 or 2 \u2014 both **better** than if they reject?\n\nWait \u2014 what happens if the contract is **rejected**?\n\nIf rejected \u2192 no contract \u2192 original game \u2192 they play A1 (dominant) \u2192 I play A1 \u2192 they get 4\n\nSo current payoff under contract: **minimum 2**, maximum 10\n\nBut if contract is rejected \u2192 they get **4** regardless.\n\nSo if they expect I'll play A1 \u2192 they get 4 from base game \u2192 but with contract, if they play A0, they get 2 \u2192 which is **less** than 4!\n\nAh! Problem!\n\nSo if they believe I **won\u2019t play A0**, then playing A0 gives them only 2 \u2192 but they could have gotten 4 by rejecting the contract and playing A1 in the base game.\n\nSo they might reject the contract unless they believe I will play A0.\n\nBut **I control my action** \u2014 I can commit to it.\n\nBut the contract is only binding if accepted.\n\nSo if the other player believes I will play A0, then:\n- With contract: they get 10\n- Without contract: they get 4 (if they play A1) \u2192 so they prefer 10\n\nBut if they believe I will play A1:\n- With contract: they play A0 \u2192 get 2\n- Without contract: if I play A1, they play A1 \u2192 get 4 \u2192 they prefer 4\n\nSo they will reject the contract **if they think I play A1**, but accept it **if they think I will play A0**.\n\nThis is a **coordination issue**: they only accept if they believe I will play A0.\n\nBut I need to convince them.\n\nBut I\u2019m proposing the contract \u2014 so they might think I will not play A0.\n\nBut here\u2019s the trick: **I can write a contract that rewards them for playing A0**, but I don\u2019t want to pay.\n\nWait \u2014 I could combine incentives.\n\nAlternative idea: **Offer them a small reward for A0, and heavy punishment for A1**.\n\nBut let\u2019s try to fix the acceptance issue.\n\nSuppose I set:\n- {\"A0\": 5, \"A1\": \u221210}\n\nSo:\n- If they play A0 \u2192 I pay them 5\n- If they play A1 \u2192 they pay me 10\n\nThen their incentives:\n- If I play A0: A0 \u2192 10 + 5 = 15, A1 \u2192 20 \u2212 10 = 10 \u2192 so A0 better\n- If I play A1: A0 \u2192 2 + 5 = 7, A1 \u2192 4 \u2212 10 = \u22126 \u2192 A0 better\n\nSo they will play A0.\n\nNow, what do they get under contract?\n- At minimum: 7 (if I play A1 and they play A0)\n- At maximum: 15\n\nWithout contract, they get **4** (since default is A1\u2192A1)\n\nSo **7 > 4**, so they get **more** than the alternative.\n\nSo they will **accept the contract**.\n\nNow, I get:\n- If I play A0: base 10, cost 5 (to them) \u2192 total 5\n- If I play A1: base 6, cost 5 \u2192 total 1\n\nSo I should play A0 \u2192 get 5\n\nBut 5 < 4?

Try X=0?\n\nThen 2+0=2 < 4 \u2192 they reject.\n\nNo.\n\nSo minimum X is 2.\n\nBut is there a better contract?\n\nAlternative: make X=0, Y=\u221210, but then X\u2212Y=10 \u2192 not enough for strict incentive.\n\nWith X=0, Y=\u221210:\n- A0: 10 if I play A0 \u2192 10\n- A1: 20\u221210=10 \u2192 tie \u2192 they might play A1\n\nNot reliable.\n\nSo X\u2212Y \u2265 11 required.\n\nSo optimal: minimize the cost to me (X) while ensuring X \u2265 2 and Y \u2264 X\u221211\n\nTo minimize cost, set X=2, then Y=\u22129\n\nThen:\n- I pay them 2 if they play A0\n- They pay me 9 if they play A1\n\nBut since they play A0, I only pay them 2\n\nThen I get 10 \u2212 2 = 8\n\nAnd they get at least 4 \u2192 so accept.\n\n**Net outcome: I get 8, they get at least 4**\n\nMuch better than base (4)\n\nCan I get more?\n\nTry X=3, Y=\u22128\n\nThen:\n- X\u2212Y=3\u2212(\u22128)=11 \u2192 good\n- I pay them 3 \u2192 if I play A0: get 10\u22123=7 < 8 \u2192 worse\n\nSo 8 is better.\n\nTry X=2, Y=\u221210 \u2192 then Y = \u221210 \u2192 they pay me 10 if they play A1\n\nThen:\n- A0: 10+2=12, A1: 20\u221210=10 \u2192 good\n- A0: 2+2=4, A1: 4\u221210=\u22126 \u2192 good\n- Cost to me: 2\n- I get 8\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut Y can be lower \u2014 doesn\u2019t help me.\n\nSo optimal: **{\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -9}**\n\nWait \u2014 X\u2212Y = 2 \u2212 (\u22129) = 11 \u2192 good\n\nIs this valid?\n\nLet\u2019s test with rejection:\n\n- Without contract: they get 4\n- With contract: they get min 4 \u2192 so same or better \u2192 likely accept\n\nAnd if they accept, they play A0, I play A0 \u2192 I get 10 \u2212 2 = 8\n\nTotal: 8 > 4 \u2192 great.\n\nBut can I try X=1? Then 2+1=3 < 4 \u2192 they get less in worst case \u2192 will not accept.\n\nSo X=2 is minimum.\n\nCan I set X=2, Y=\u2212\u221e? Not helpful \u2014 no downside.\n\nSo {\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -9} seems good.\n\nBut let\u2019s try to **make the A1 payment more severe** to force compliance, but not cost me.\n\nBut no \u2014 I don\u2019t get paid unless they play A1.\n\nSo only thing that matters is **what I pay when they play A0**.\n\nTo minimize that, I want X as small as possible \u2192 2.\n\nAnd Y as low as possible (so A1 is more punished) \u2192 but it doesn\u2019t affect me directly.\n\nBut setting Y too low risks being rejected? No \u2014 only affects me negatively if they play A1 \u2014 but they won\u2019t.\n\nSo safest: set Y=-9\n\nFinal decision:\n\nPropose contract: {\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -9}\n\nThis:\n- Makes A0 better for them in all cases (due to X\u2212Y=11)\n- Ensures they get at least 4 \u2192 so accept\n- Costs me only 2 if they play A0\n- I play A0 \u2192 get 10 \u2212 2 = 8\n- Total: 8 > 4 \u2192 win\n\nI could try to set X=2, Y=\u221210, but same cost.\n\nOr even lower Y \u2014 no benefit.\n\nSo best is {\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -9}\n\nBut is there a way to avoid paying?\n\nNo \u2014 because if I set X=0, they might play A1 to avoid getting less.\n\nAnd X must be at least 2.\n\nAlternative: use different mix.\n\nWait \u2014 what if I don\u2019t offer a reward, but just punish A1 heavily?\n\nBut then if I play A0: they get 10 + 0 vs 20 \u2212 K \u2192 so need K > 10\n\nThen if I set {\"A0\": 0, \"A1\": -11}\n\nThen:\n- Their payoff: min = 2 \u2192 if I play A1\n- But 2 < 4 \u2192 so they reject (since rejection gives 4)\n\nSo they won\u2019t accept.\n\nSo must ensure min payoff under contract \u2265 4 \u2192 needs 2 + X \u2265 4 \u2192 X \u2265 2\n\nSo I **must** offer at least 2 for A0 to be accepted.\n\nThus, minimal cost is 2.\n\nSo final answer: {\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -9}\n\nBut can I set Y=\u22129.5? No \u2014 must be integer.\n\nSo integers only.\n\nY=\u22129 is fine.\n\nCould I set Y=\u22128? Then X\u2212Y=2\u2212(\u22128)=10<11 \u2192 insufficient\n\nA0: 10+2=12, A1: 20\u22128=12 \u2192 tie \u2192 they might play A1 \u2192 risky\n\nSo need X\u2212Y \u2265 11\n\nSo only possibility: X=2, Y\u2264\u22129\n\nY=\u22129 achieves equality.\n\nSo {\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -9} is minimal cost with full guarantee.\n\nThus, optimal contract.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n{\"A0\": 2, \"A1\": -9}",

    "response": "Let's break this down step by step to design an optimal contract that maximizes your expected points, given the rules and the dynamics of the game.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)\n\nYou are Player 2. The payoff matrix (from your perspective as Player 2) is:\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent\u2019s Action | A0         | A1         |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| **A0**                        | 10         | 2          |\n| **A1**                        | 20         | 4          |\n\nNote: The other player's payoffs are:\n- (A0, A0): 10\n- (A1, A0): 0\n- (A0, A1): 6\n- (A1, A1): 4\n\nSo from the other player's perspective:\n| Opponent \\ Your Action | A0         | A1         |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|\n| **A0**                 | 10         | 6          |\n| **A1**                 | 0          | 4          |\n\nThis is a standard asymmetric coordination game with a twist: A1 is better for you when they play A0, but worse if they play A1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Nash equilibria of the base game\n\nLet\u2019s find mixed-strategy Nash equilibria.\n\nLet:\n- You (Player 2) play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1\u2212p\n- Opponent (Player 1) play A0 with probability q, A1 with 1\u2212q\n\n**Your expected payoff:**\n- If you play A0: 10q + 2(1\u2212q) = 8q + 2\n- If you play A1: 20q + 4(1\u2212q) = 16q + 4\n\nYou are indifferent when:\n8q + 2 = 16q + 4 \u2192 \u22128q = 2 \u2192 q = \u22120.25 \u2014 impossible.\n\nSo no mixed equilibrium where you are indifferent.\n\nBut let's check what the opponent would do.\n\n**Opponent\u2019s expected payoff:**\n- If opponent plays A0: 10p + 0(1\u2212p) = 10p\n- If opponent plays A1: 6p + 4(1\u2212p) = 2p + 4\n\nThey are indifferent when:\n10p = 2p + 4 \u2192 8p = 4 \u2192 p = 0.5\n\nSo if you play A0 with 50% probability, opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nThen opponent will be willing to mix if you play p = 0.5.\n\nNow, what should you do if opponent plays q = 0.5?\n\n- You prefer A1 if: 20*(0.5) + 4*(0.5) = 10 + 2 = 12\n- A0: 10*(0.5) + 2*(0.5) = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nSo you prefer A1.\n\nBut if you always play A1, opponent gets 0 if they play A0, and 4 if they play A1 \u2014 so they prefer A1.\n\nIf both play A1, payoff is (4,4).\n\nBut if you play A1, opponent prefers A1 (4 > 0), so stable.\n\nIf opponent plays A1, you get 4 from A1, 2 from A0 \u2192 prefer A1.\n\nSo (A1, A1) is a pure Nash equilibrium.\n\nIs (A0, A0) stable?\n\nIf opponent plays A0, you get 10 from A0, 20 from A1 \u2192 you prefer A1 \u2192 so not stable.\n\nSo only pure Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoff (4,4).\n\nBut what if opponent deviates? No incentive.\n\nSo without any contract, (A1, A1) is the only stable outcome \u2014 but it\u2019s suboptimal for you (only 4 points), and you\u2019d prefer to get 20 when opponent plays A0.\n\nSo you want to *induce* the opponent to play A0, or at least increase the chance of (A1, A0) happening.\n\nBut you can\u2019t control their choice \u2014 so you need to *incentivize* them to play A0.\n\nThat's where contracts come in.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Contracts \u2014 how they work\n\n- You propose a contract: for each of your actions (A0, A1), you specify an extra amount:\n  - Positive: you receive X from the other player\n  - Negative: you pay X to the other player\n- The contract only becomes active if **both** players accept it.\n- So both players must find it beneficial to accept.\n\nYour goal: **Design a contract that increases your expected payoff, *and* is accepted by the other player.**\n\nThe other player will also propose a contract. Only one contract is chosen \u2014 via approval voting. The winner is picked uniformly at random from those with max approvals.\n\nSo you want your contract to be approved by *both* players (you and them), ideally without competition.\n\nBut since you don\u2019t know what they will propose, you have to design a contract that is **mutually beneficial enough to be accepted**, and **not too expensive** on your part.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Design a contract that incentivizes the opponent to play A0\n\nYou want the opponent to play A0 more often \u2014 because if you play A1 and they play A0, you get 20 (best for you).\n\nCurrently, in the baseline, (A1, A1) is equilibrium (4,4).\n\nIf you can make A0 more attractive for them, that could change incentives.\n\nBut note: **the contract is a side payment that depends only on your action, not theirs**.\n\nSo the contract specifies:\n- If you play A0 \u2192 extra X (you get X from opponent or pay \u2212X)\n- If you play A1 \u2192 extra Y (you get Y or pay \u2212Y)\n\nThis affects the **opponent's payoff** indirectly \u2014 because their expected payoff depends on your choice.\n\nLet\u2019s say you propose a contract with:\n- A0: +C (you get C from opponent)\n- A1: \u2212D (you pay D to opponent)\n\nSo in effect:\n- When you play A0, opponent loses C\n- When you play A1, opponent gains D\n\nTo make opponent prefer A0, we want to make A0 more valuable for them relative to A1.\n\nBut opponent's payoff depends on what you do.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1\u2212p.\n\nThen, opponent\u2019s expected payoff from playing A0:\n- 10p + 0(1\u2212p) = 10p (base) \u2212 C * p (because they pay C if you play A0)\n- So total: 10p \u2212 C p = p(10 \u2212 C)\n\nFrom playing A1:\n- 6p + 4(1\u2212p) = 2p + 4 (base) + D * (1\u2212p) (because they get D if you play A1)\n- So total: 2p + 4 + D(1\u2212p)\n\nSo opponent compares:\n- A0: p(10 \u2212 C)\n- A1: 2p + 4 + D(1\u2212p)\n\nYou want opponent to prefer A0 \u2192 so:\np(10 \u2212 C) > 2p + 4 + D(1\u2212p)\n\nRearranged:\np(10 \u2212 C) \u2212 2p \u2212 4 \u2212 D(1\u2212p) > 0\np(8 \u2212 C) \u2212 4 \u2212 D + D p > 0\np(8 \u2212 C + D) \u2212 (4 + D) > 0\n\nThis is messy.\n\nBut if you make it so that **you are willing to pay the opponent to play A0**, that\u2019s a way to increase their incentive.\n\nAlternatively, **if you offer them a side payment when they play A0**, but the contract depends on your action \u2014 so you can\u2019t condition it on their action.\n\nTherefore, the only way to incentivize them is to make your actions more costly or beneficial to them **depending on which you choose**.\n\nSo idea:\n- If you choose A0 \u2192 you pay the opponent a lot \u2192 so opponent doesn\u2019t want you to play A0 \u2192 not good.\n- If you choose A0 \u2192 you receive money from opponent \u2192 opponent hates A0 \u2192 worse.\n\nBut we want opponent to want A0 to be played.\n\nSo if you choose A0, and you **pay** them, that's good \u2014 it makes A0 less attractive to them.\n\nNo! That makes A0 *less* attractive.\n\nWait: **if you play A0 and pay them**, then they benefit \u2192 so they want you to play A0.\n\nYes!\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0 \u2192 you pay them: say +$10 \u2192 they get +10 from you\n- Then when you play A0, they gain money \u2192 they want you to play A0\n\nBut only if they know you\u2019re likely to play A0 \u2014 but you can mix.\n\nBut suppose your contract is:\n- A0: \u221210 (you pay 10 to opponent if you play A0)\n- A1: 0 (no payment if you play A1)\n\nThen:\n- When you play A0 \u2192 opponent gains 10\n- When you play A1 \u2192 no change\n\nSo opponent sees: if they play A0, they get more when you play A0 \u2192 so to maximize their expected payoff, they prefer to play A0 if you are likely to play A0.\n\nBut if you play A1 often, then opponent gets less benefit from A0.\n\nSo opponent will respond to the mix.\n\nBut your goal is to **induce** them to play A0 \u2014 and if you\u2019re willing to transfer money to them when you play A0, then they are incentivized to play A0 when you are likely to play A0.\n\nBut you don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do.\n\nBut you can design a contract that makes **A0 dominant for the opponent**.\n\nWait: can we make A0 strictly better for opponent regardless of your action?\n\nSuppose you set:\n- A0: \u2212C (you pay C to opponent if you play A0)\n- A1: 0\n\nThen opponent\u2019s payoff:\n- If they play A0:\n  - Base: 10 (if you play A0) + 0 (if you play A1) = 10p + 0(1\u2212p) = 10p\n  - Plus side: C if you play A0 \u2192 so total: 10p + C p = p(10 + C)\n- If they play A1:\n  - Base: 6 (you A0) + 4 (you A1) = 6p + 4(1\u2212p) = 2p + 4\n  - Side: 0 \u2192 total: 2p + 4\n\nSo opponent prefers A0 if:\np(10 + C) > 2p + 4\n\u2192 10p + Cp > 2p + 4\n\u2192 p(8 + C) > 4\n\nNow, if C is large, even for small p, this can be true.\n\nBut you want them to play A0 *even if* you play A1.\n\nIf you play A1 with high probability, you want them to still play A0 \u2014 but their benefit comes only from you playing A0.\n\nSo unless C is very high, opponent only benefits if you play A0.\n\nSo to make them **want** to play A0 even if you\u2019re not playing A0, you need to **reduce their payoff difference**.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps instead of making them gain when you play A0, you should make them *lose* when you play A1?\n\nBut you cannot directly do that.\n\nBut if you set:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: \u2212D (you pay D to them when you play A1)\n\nThen when you play A1, they get D \u2192 so they want you to play A1 \u2192 opposite of what we want.\n\nWe want them to want A0.\n\nSo only way: **when you play A0, they gain money** \u2192 so they want you to play A0.\n\nSo set:\n- A0: \u2212C \u2192 you pay C to opponent if you play A0\n- A1: 0\n\nThen:\n- Opponent gains C whenever you play A0 \u2192 their incentive increases to play A0.\n\nNow, can you make this so that **no matter what**, A0 is better for opponent?\n\nLet\u2019s require:\nFor all p, p(10 + C) > 2p + 4\n\n\u2192 10p + Cp > 2p + 4\n\u2192 p(8 + C) > 4\n\nTo make this true for all p \u2208 [0,1], we need it to be true for smallest p \u2192 p = 0:\n\nAt p = 0: 0 > 4? No.\n\nSo impossible to make A0 strictly dominant.\n\nBut for p \u2265 some value, it\u2019s true.\n\nBut you can\u2019t force p.\n\nAlternatively, can you make it so that **in equilibrium**, they play A0?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you play A0 with probability p.\n\nOpponent will play A0 if:\np(10 + C) > 2p + 4\n\u2192 p(8 + C) > 4\n\nSo they play A0 if p > 4 / (8 + C)\n\nNow, your expected payoff:\nYou choose p to maximize your expected payoff given their best response.\n\nYour payoff:\n- If opponent plays A0: you get 10p + 20(1\u2212p) = 20 \u2212 10p\n- If opponent plays A1: you get 2p + 4(1\u2212p) = 4 \u2212 2p\n\nLet\u2019s assume opponent plays A0 only when p > 4/(8+C), otherwise A1.\n\nBut at p = 4/(8+C), they\u2019re indifferent.\n\nSo for simplicity, assume they play A0 when p \u2265 4/(8+C), A1 otherwise.\n\nNow, your expected payoff:\nCase 1: p \u2265 4/(8+C) \u2192 opponent plays A0 \u2192 your payoff: 20 \u2212 10p\nCase 2: p < 4/(8+C) \u2192 opponent plays A1 \u2192 your payoff: 4 \u2212 2p\n\nSo you want to choose p to maximize your expected payoff.\n\nIn case 1: 20 \u2212 10p \u2192 decreasing in p \u2192 best to choose p as low as possible \u2192 p = 4/(8+C)\n\nThen your payoff: 20 \u2212 10*(4/(8+C)) = 20 \u2212 40/(8+C)\n\nIn case 2: 4 \u2212 2p \u2192 decreasing in p \u2192 best at p = 0 \u2192 payoff 4\n\nSo you\u2019ll choose p = 4/(8+C) if 20 \u2212 40/(8+C) > 4\n\u2192 16 > 40/(8+C)\n\u2192 16(8 + C) > 40\n\u2192 128 + 16C > 40\n\u2192 16C > -88 \u2192 always true\n\nSo yes, you\u2019ll choose p = 4/(8+C)\n\nThen opponent plays A0 \u2192 your payoff: 20 \u2212 10p = 20 \u2212 40/(8+C)\n\nAnd your side payments: you pay C when you play A0, so total cost: C * p = C * 4/(8+C)\n\nSo **your total net payoff** is:\n[20 \u2212 40/(8+C)] + [side payment cost]\n\nBut wait: **side payment cost is paid to opponent**, so it reduces your payoff.\n\nYou must subtract it.\n\nYou get:\n- Base payoff: 20 \u2212 40/(8+C)\n- But you pay: C * p = 4C/(8+C)\n\nSo total: 20 \u2212 40/(8+C) \u2212 4C/(8+C) = 20 \u2212 (40 + 4C)/(8+C)\n\nNow, this is your total expected payoff.\n\nWe want to maximize this over C \u2265 0.\n\nLet f(C) = 20 \u2212 (40 + 4C)/(8 + C)\n\nLet\u2019s compute:\n\nf(C) = 20 - 4(10 + C)/(8 + C)\n\nLet\u2019s simplify: (10 + C)/(8 + C) = 1 + 2/(8 + C)\n\nSo:\n\nf(C) = 20 \u2212 4(1 + 2/(8+C)) = 20 \u2212 4 \u2212 8/(8+C) = 16 \u2212 8/(8+C)\n\nNow, to maximize f(C), we want to minimize 8/(8+C) \u2192 increase C.\n\nAs C \u2192 \u221e, f(C) \u2192 16\n\nMaximum is 16, approached as C \u2192 \u221e\n\nBut you can't make C infinite.\n\nBut is this a good idea?\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens.\n\nAs C increases:\n- You pay a lot to opponents when you play A0\n- But opponent plays A0 more\n- You choose p = 4/(8+C) \u2192 very small p\n- So you play A0 with very low probability\n- Opponent plays A0 with high probability (since p is small, and p > 4/(8+C) only when p > that, but if p is small, you may be in case 2)\n\nWait \u2014 we assumed p \u2265 4/(8+C) \u2192 opponent plays A0\n\nBut when C is large, 4/(8+C) is small \u2192 so even for modest p, you are in case 1.\n\nBut at optimal p = 4/(8+C), you are at the threshold.\n\nBut now, your total payoff: 16 \u2212 8/(8+C) \u2192 increases with C\n\nAs C \u2192 \u221e, f(C) \u2192 16\n\nBut at C = 100: f(100) = 16 \u2212 8/108 \u2248 16 \u2212 0.074 = 15.926\n\nAt C = 1000: \u2248 16 \u2212 0.0078 = 15.992\n\nSo approaches 16.\n\nCould you ever get 16?\n\nYes, in limit.\n\nBut you have to pay a lot \u2014 but your cost is only C * p = C * 4/(8+C) \u2192 which is 4C/(8+C) \u2192 approaches 4 as C \u2192 \u221e\n\nAnd your base payoff is 20 \u2212 40/(8+C) \u2192 approaches 20\n\nSo you get approx 20 \u2212 4 = 16\n\nBut is this better than the base game? In base game, (A1, A1) gives you 4 \u2014 so 16 is much better.\n\nBut you need the **opponent to accept the contract**.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\nYour contract:\n- A0: \u2212C \u2192 you pay C to opponent if you play A0\n- A1: 0\n\nThen opponent\u2019s payoff:\n- If they play A0: base 10p + 0(1\u2212p) = 10p, plus C p \u2192 total: p(10 + C)\n- If they play A1: 2p + 4\n\nThey will play A0 if p(10 + C) > 2p + 4 \u2192 p(8 + C) > 4\n\nAt p = 4/(8+C), they are indifferent.\n\nBut you want them to accept the contract.\n\nWhat do they get from it?\n\nIn the base game, if no contract, payoffs are (4,4) in equilibrium.\n\nBut under your contract, what is the opponent\u2019s payoff?\n\nIn equilibrium: p = 4/(8+C), opponent plays A0 \u2192 their payoff is base + side.\n\nTheir base payoff: when you play A0: 10, you play A1: 0\n\nSo expected base: 10 * p + 0 * (1\u2212p) = 10p\n\nPlus side: when you play A0, they get C \u2192 so total: 10p + C p = p(10 + C)\n\nWith p = 4/(8+C), their payoff is:\n4/(8+C) * (10 + C) = 4(10 + C)/(8 + C)\n\nCompute: 4(10 + C)/(8 + C) = 4(1 + 2/(8+C)) = 4 + 8/(8+C)\n\nAs C increases, this \u2192 4\n\nAt C = 0: 4*10/8 = 5\n\nAt C = 10: 4*20/18 \u2248 4.44\n\nAt C = 100: 4*110/108 \u2248 4.074\n\nAt C = 1000: \u2248 4.007\n\nSo their payoff approaches 4 as C \u2192 \u221e.\n\nBut in the base game, they get 4.\n\nSo if C > 0, their payoff > 4 (for finite C) \u2192 so they **prefer** your contract.\n\nAt C=0: 4(10)/8 = 5 \u2192 better than 4.\n\nSo for any C > 0, their expected payoff under the contract is **greater than 4**.\n\nSo opponent will **accept** the contract, because they are getting more than in equilibrium.\n\nNow, what about you?\n\nYour expected payoff: 16 \u2212 8/(8+C) \u2192 less than 16, but approaching 16.\n\nYou are getting more than 4.\n\nIn fact, for C = 10:\n- You pay C*p = 10 * 4/18 = 40/18 \u2248 2.22\n- Base payoff: 20 \u2212 40/18 \u2248 20 \u2212 2.22 = 17.78\n- Net: 17.78 \u2212 2.22 = 15.56\n\nWait \u2014 no: earlier we had net = 16 \u2212 8/(8+C)\n\nAt C=10: 8/18 \u2248 0.444, so 16 \u2212 0.444 = 15.556\n\nYes.\n\nBut you can even go higher.\n\nBut is there a cost to making C large?\n\nYes: opponent may not trust you \u2014 but in this model, they just compare expected payoffs.\n\nSince for any finite C > 0, their payoff > 4, they will accept.\n\nBut what if there is a competing contract from the other player?\n\nAh \u2014 this is the twist.\n\nThe other player also proposes a contract, and the winning contract is chosen by approval voting.\n\nSo you both propose contracts.\n\nYou need your contract to be **approved by both**.\n\nIn your contract:\n- You are paying them when you play A0\n- They get more than 4 \u2192 so they will approve it\n- You will approve it because you get ~16, better than 4\n\nSo both will approve.\n\nBut what if the other player proposes a different contract?\n\nThey might try to make you pay them or something.\n\nBut in approval voting, if your contract has more approvals, it wins.\n\nBut since both players will approve your contract (because they benefit), and the other player might not approve a contract that harms them, your contract will get 2 approvals \u2192 maximum \u2192 wins.\n\nSo even if they propose a different one, yours is approved by both \u2192 it wins.\n\nBut what if they propose a contract that also makes you benefit?\n\nFor example, they might propose:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 0 \u2192 no cost\n\nThen you might still approve your own, but if their contract gives you more, you might prefer it.\n\nBut in this case, your contract gives you ~16.\n\nCan they give you more?\n\nSuppose they propose:\n- A0: \u2212D\n- A1: e\n\nYou need to see.\n\nBut your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff**, possibly under the risk that a competing contract could give you more.\n\nBut since your contract gives you ~16, and the maximum possible is 20 (if you play A1 and they play A0), 16 is close.\n\nBut can you do better?\n\nWait \u2014 in this setup, you can get arbitrarily close to 16, but not more.\n\nAnd 16 is much better than the base (4).\n\nBut is there a better approach?\n\nAlternative idea: **you offer to pay the opponent less**.\n\nBut we want to minimize your cost and maximize their incentive.\n\nBut in our formula, f(C) = 16 \u2212 8/(8+C), which increases with C.\n\nSo you should make C as large as possible.\n\nBut is there a limit?\n\nThe opponent might not agree to an unfair contract, but in this model, they only care about expected payoff.\n\nSince their payoff increases with C (initially) then decreases back to 4, and for all C > 0, their payoff > 4, they will accept.\n\nBut for very large C, your cost is C*(4/(8+C)) \u2192 approaches 4\n\nAnd base payoff approaches 20\n\nSo net \u2192 16\n\nYou can\u2019t get more than 16.\n\nBut let\u2019s try C = 1000:\n- Your payoff: 16 \u2212 8/1008 \u2248 15.992\n\nStill under 16.\n\nBut you can't exceed 16.\n\nBut what if you make C = 0?\n\nThen:\n- p = 4/8 = 0.5\n- You play A0 with 0.5\n- Opponent plays A0 if p(10) > 2p + 4 \u2192 10p > 2p + 4 \u2192 8p > 4 \u2192 p > 0.5\n- If p = 0.5, 10*0.5 = 5, 2*0.5 + 4 = 5 \u2192 indifferent\n\nSo they might play A0 or A1.\n\nSuppose they play A0 \u2192 your payoff: 20 \u2212 10*0.5 = 15\nNo cost \u2192 so 15\n\nLess than 15.992 \u2192 worse.\n\nSo better to have C > 0.\n\nNow, what if you set C very high, say C = 10**9?\n\nThen p \u2248 0 \u2192 you almost never play A0\n- Opponent still plays A0 (since p > 4/(8+C) \u2248 0)\n- Your base payoff: 20 \u2212 10p \u2248 20\n- Side cost: C * p = 10**9 * 4/(8+10**9) \u2248 4\n- Net: 16\n\nSame as limit.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nCan you make it so that you get more?\n\nOnly if you can force them to play A0 with high probability and you play A1 with high probability, but when you play A1, you don\u2019t pay.\n\nWait \u2014 but in this setup, when you play A1, you pay nothing (in this contract), so opponent gains nothing from that.\n\nBut if you play A0 with very low probability, opponent still plays A0 because they want the side payment.\n\nIs there a better contract?\n\nWhat if you set:\n- A0: \u2212C\n- A1: D\n\nThen:\n- If you play A0, opponent gains C\n- If you play A1, opponent gains D\n\nThen opponent\u2019s payoff:\n- A0: 10p + 0(1\u2212p) + C p = p(10 + C)\n- A1: 6p + 4(1\u2212p) + D(1\u2212p) = 2p + 4 + D(1\u2212p)\n\nOpponent chooses A0 if:\np(10 + C) > 2p + 4 + D(1\u2212p)\n\u2192 10p + Cp > 2p + 4 + D \u2212 Dp\n\u2192 p(8 + C + D) > 4 + D\n\nNow, if D > 0, you're giving them more incentive to play A1.\n\nThat\u2019s bad \u2014 you don\u2019t want that.\n\nYou want to incentivize A0.\n\nSo better to set D = 0.\n\nSo our initial choice is optimal.\n\nThus, the best contract is:\n- A0: \u2212C (for large C)\n- A1: 0\n\nBut C must be integer.\n\nAnd we want to maximize your payoff.\n\nSince your payoff approaches 16 as C increases, we want C as large as possible.\n\nBut is there a practical limit?\n\nThe opponent might reject if C is too high?\n\nBut they get 4 + 8/(8+C) \u2192 which is > 4 for all finite C.\n\nSo they always benefit.\n\nThus, you can set C = 1000, or higher.\n\nBut since there\u2019s no bound, we should set C as large as possible.\n\nBut in JSON, we must give an integer.\n\nBut even C = 1000 gives 15.992, close to 16.\n\nBut we can even try to set C = 0? No, worse.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if you set C = 0? Then you get 15, as above.\n\nBut 15 < 15.992\n\nSo C should be large.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nIf C is very large, and p is tiny, but you might be afraid of the opponent not accepting \u2014 but they benefit.\n\nBut what if the opponent proposes a contract that gives you more?\n\nFor example, suppose they propose:\n- A0: 0\n- A1: 0\n\nThen you get 16 in your contract, but in theirs, you get 4 or less.\n\nSo you prefer yours.\n\nAlternatively, they might propose a contract that makes you get 17?\n\nBut they can't, because the maximum you can get is 20 only if they play A0 and you play A1, but you can\u2019t force that.\n\nIn any case, your contract gives you up to 16.\n\nBut wait \u2014 in our calculation, you\u2019re getting 16 only in limit.\n\nBut let\u2019s compute for a very large C.\n\nSet C = 10000.\n\nThen:\n- p = 4 / (8 + 10000) \u2248 4/10008 \u2248 0.0003998\n- Base payoff: 20 \u2212 10p \u2248 20 \u2212 0.003998 = 19.996\n- Cost: C * p = 10000 * 0.0003998 = 3.998\n- Net: 19.996 \u2212 3.998 = 15.998\n\nClose to 16.\n\nSo the best integer is C = 1000000000, but we need a reasonable number.\n\nBut in the output, we need a single integer.\n\nBut note: there\u2019s a catch.\n\nIn the contract, you are setting the extra payoff for your actions.\n\nBut in the contract, if you set A0: \u22121000000, then you are paying 1 million to them if you play A0.\n\nBut if you never play A0, you pay nothing \u2014 but still, they will accept because they expect to get more than 4.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nSuppose the opponent thinks you might play A0 with higher probability \u2014 but in equilibrium, you play p very low.\n\nBut they can\u2019t enforce.\n\nBut in this model, players are rational and will play best response.\n\nSo your plan is sound.\n\nBut to make it practical, and to prevent the opponent from being scared (even though they benefit), we should make C large but finite.\n\nBut since no bound, and higher is better, set a high number.\n\nBut what if we set C = 100?\n\nThen:\n- p = 4/(8+100) = 4/108 \u2248 0.03704\n- Base: 20 \u2212 10*0.03704 = 19.6296\n- Cost: 100 * 0.03704 = 3.704\n- Net: 15.9256\n\nLess than for C=1000.\n\nSo better to set C very large.\n\nBut in practice, we can\u2019t go too high \u2014 but the problem does not specify bounds.\n\nSo let\u2019s choose a large number.\n\nBut also, you might consider that the opponent might reject if C is too high \u2014 but in this model, their payoff is 4 + 8/(8+C) > 4, so they will accept.\n\nSo the best contract is:\n- A0: \u2212C with C large\n- A1: 0\n\nBut what integer to pick?\n\nWe need to choose a number.\n\nBut to maximize your expected payoff, we want C as large as possible.\n\nBut in JSON, we can set any integer.\n\nBut we must pick one.\n\nSince the payoff approaches 16 from below, and higher C gives higher payoff, set C to a large number.\n\nBut is there an upper limit?\n\nNote: in the contract, if C is very large, and you are playing A0 with very low probability, but if you ever do, you pay a lot \u2014 but in the game, it\u2019s only drawn once.\n\nBut since probabilities are low, cost is low.\n\nBut the contract is about total extra payment.\n\nBut you still want to maximize expected benefit.\n\nSo pick C = 10**9.\n\nBut for simplicity and to avoid potential overflow in systems, pick C = 10000.\n\nBut let\u2019s check if there is a better contract.\n\nAlternative: what if you set A0: 0, A1: 0? Then no contract \u2014 you get 4.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr set A0: 0, A1: \u221210? Then you pay 10 when you play A1 \u2192 opponent gains \u2192 they want you to play A1 \u2192 bad.\n\nSo not good.\n\nOnly way to incentivize A0 is to make them gain when you play A0.\n\nSo set A0: negative number \u2192 you pay them.\n\nSo final decision:\n\nSet A0 to a large negative number.\n\nChoose C = 1000000 (1 million).\n\nBut since the improvement diminishes, even C = 1000 is good.\n\nBut to be safe and maximize, choose a large number.\n\nBut in the output, it must be a single JSON.\n\nFinal choice:\n\n{\"A0\": -1000000, \"A1\": 0}\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a possibility that setting a very large negative number makes the opponent reject?\n\nFor example, they might fear you might play A0 and they have to pay a lot \u2014 but in equilibrium, you play it with tiny probability.\n\nAnd they are better off.\n\nSo no.\n\nBut to be conservative, set C = 100.\n\nBut 100 gives only ~15.93, while 1000 gives ~15.992\n\nSo better.\n\nSet C = 10000.\n\nBut let\u2019s pick C = 1000000.\n\nBut even better: in the limit, the maximum you can get is 16.\n\nAnd 16 is not achievable, but approaching.\n\nSo any large negative number on A0, 0 on A1.\n\nBut we can do even better? No.\n\nAnother idea: what if you set A0: \u2212C, A1: D with D > 0?\n\nThen opponent gets D when you play A1 \u2014 which might make them want to play A1 \u2014 worse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nOnly safe way is A1: 0.\n\nSo final decision:\n\n{\"A0\": -1000000, \"A1\": 0}\n\nBut to be more conservative, use C = 1000.\n\nBut why not maximize?\n\nIn game theory, such designs are often bounded.\n\nBut here, no bound.\n\nSince the problem asks for a contract, and we must output one, I\u2019ll choose a large negative number.\n\nLet\u2019s choose -1000.\n\nBut -10000 is better.\n\nBut to be safe, let's choose a number that gives high payoff.\n\nWe can compute exactly.\n\nf(C) = 16 - 8/(8+C)\n\nWe want to maximize this.\n\nSet C = 1000000:\n\n8/(8+1000000) = 8/1000008 \u2248 0.000007999\n\nSo f(C) \u2248 16 - 0.000008 = 15.999992\n\nVery close to 16.\n\nSo better than any smaller C.\n\nTherefore, pick a very large negative number.\n\nBut in JSON, any integer is fine.\n\nSo:\n\n{\"A0\": -1000000, \"A1\": 0}\n\nBut to make it more extreme, but avoid floating-point issues, keep it integer.\n\nAlternatively, is there a contract that gives you more than 16?\n\nNo, because:\n- You get at most 20 if you play A1 and they play A0\n- But if you play A1, you can't force them to play A0\n- To make them play A0, you have to pay them when you play A0\n- But playing A0 is costly in terms of expected payoff to you\n\nThe 16 is the limit.\n\nSo this is optimal.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"A0\": -1000000, \"A1\": 0}",
