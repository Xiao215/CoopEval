Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

response:
The objective of this game is to maximize your total points. Let’s evaluate the original payoff matrix:

- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In the original game, there are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) provides the highest total points (5), it carries the risk of a 0-point payoff if the other player deviates and chooses A1. Action A1 is "safer" because it guarantees at least 0 points and results in a 3-point payoff if the other player also chooses A1.

To guarantee the (5, 5) outcome, we can design a contract that makes A0 a dominant strategy for both players. A contract modifies the payoffs: a player receives an additional amount for their chosen action, which is deducted from the other player's total.

Let $c_0$ be the additional payment for action A0 and $c_1$ be the payment for action A1.
New Payoff for Player 1 = Original Payoff + $c_{\text{ActionP1}} - c_{\text{ActionP2}}$

If we set $c_0 = 4$ and $c_1 = 0$, the difference $c_0 - c_1 = 4$.
New Payoff Matrix:
- (A0, A0): (5 + 4 - 4, 5 + 4 - 4) = (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 4 - 0, 3 + 0 - 4) = (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (3 + 0 - 4, 0 + 4 - 0) = (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3 + 0 - 0, 3 + 0 - 0) = (3, 3)

With this contract:
1. If the other player plays A0, choosing A0 gives you 5 points (versus -1 for A1).
2. If the other player plays A1, choosing A0 gives you 4 points (versus 3 for A1).

In both cases, A0 is now the dominant strategy. This eliminates the risk and the coordination problem, ensuring both players receive 5 points. Rational players should approve this contract because it leads to the social optimum while removing the risk of the safer, but lower-value, (3, 3) equilibrium.

response:
Goal is to make **A0 the strictly best action no matter what the other player does**, so that (A0,A0) becomes the unique attractive outcome, while also ensuring the contract is acceptable (i.e., doesn’t reduce payoffs when both play A0).

If we set a penalty for playing **A1**, then:
- When the other plays **A1**, choosing **A0** should beat choosing **A1**.
- Base payoffs vs A1:  
  - If you play A0: 0  
  - If you play A1: 3  
  So we need the contract to add **more than +3** to A0 *relative to* A1 in that case.  
With a symmetric action-contingent transfer contract, setting **A1 = -4** (pay 4 to the other player if you play A1) makes:
- If other plays A1:  
  - Your A0 payoff becomes 0 + 4 = 4  
  - Your A1 payoff stays 3 (net transfer cancels when both pick A1)  
  So A0 is strictly better (4 > 3).
- If other plays A0:  
  - A0 gives 5  
  - A1 gives 3 − 4 = −1  
  So A0 is strictly better (5 > −1).

When both play A0, transfers net to zero, so both still get 5—making acceptance easy.

response:
To design a contract that maximizes our total points received in the game, we need to carefully analyze the payoffs of the base game and consider how the additional contract payments can influence the players' choices.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Base Game Payoffs:**
   - **(A0, A0):** You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
   - **(A0, A1):** You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
   - **(A1, A0):** You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
   - **(A1, A1):** You get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

2. **Determine Desired Outcome:**
   - The outcome (A0, A0) gives both players the highest combined points (10).
   - By choosing (A0, A0), you get 5 points and the other player gets 5 points.
   
3. **Incentivize the Desired Outcome with the Contract:**
   - We need to create a contract that makes (A0, A0) the most attractive option for both players.
   
4. **Formulate the Contract Payoffs:**
   - To incentivize (A0, A0), we can add positive extra payoffs for choosing A0 and negative or zero payoffs for choosing A1.
   - Let's pay an extra bonus for choosing A0. Additionally, penalize or provide zero incentive for choosing A1 to discourage it.

5. **Contract Proposal:**
   - **For A0:** Propose an additional payoff of +2 points for both players.
   - **For A1:** Propose an additional payoff of 0 points (neutral, keeps base game payoffs unattractive).

6. **Expected Impact of Contract:**
   - If the other player also benefits from A0, they are more likely to choose it.
   - Additional points for A0: The player receives 2 additional points, making the payoff for (A0, A0) 7 points for each player.
   - For A1, extra points are zero, making the overall payoff for A1 less attractive.

**Final Contract Proposal:**

```json
{"A0": 2, "A1": 0}
```

### Reasoning:
- By adding +2 points to A0, the total payoff for (A0, A0) becomes 7 points each, which is the highest possible combined outcome.
- Keeping A1 neutral with 0 points ensures that the base game payoffs for A1 remain less attractive compared to the incentivized A0.

This contract is compelling for both players to choose A0, aligning their interests towards the highest combined payoff, thereby maximizing your points as well.

response:
To design a payment contract that maximizes my total points in the game, we need to consider the current payoffs and how the additional payoffs can influence both players' choices.

### Current Payoffs Analysis

1. **If both choose A0**:
    - Player 1 gets 5 points.
    - Player 2 (me) gets 5 points.

2. **If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1**:
    - Player 1 gets 0 points.
    - Player 2 gets 3 points.

3. **If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0**:
    - Player 1 gets 3 points.
    - Player 2 gets 0 points.

4. **If both choose A1**:
    - Both players get 3 points.

### Goal

Since we want to maximize our points, we should aim for strategies that give us a higher average payoff. The ideal situation would be to coordinate on both playing A0 for the highest joint payoff, but this may not always be feasible if both players act in a purely self-interested manner.

### Contract Design

**Strategy Objective**: Encourage both players to choose A0, as it provides the highest joint payoff (5 points for each player). However, we must make it individually rational, so the other player has an incentive to accept the contract.

1. **For A0**: Encourage choosing A0 by providing a positive additional payoff.
2. **For A1**: Provide a disincentive for choosing A1 by adding a negative payoff.

### Contract Proposal

1. **Encourage A0**: Add a small positive payoff to both players for choosing A0.
2. **Discourage A1**: Add a small negative payoff to both players for choosing A1.

We will add these incentives such that it still remains attractive for the other player to accept the contract. 

Let's propose the following contract:
```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": -2}
```

### Reasoning

- **A0 gets +1**: This means if both players accept the contract and choose A0, they each get 6 points instead of 5.
- **A1 gets -2**: If both players accept the contract and one chooses A1, they get penalized by losing 2 points.

This incentivizes both players to prefer A0 since the expected payoff from A0 will be higher, assuming they think the other player would likely choose A0 as well under the contract.

Here is the finalized contract:
```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": -2}
```
This contract aims to shift the equilibrium towards both players choosing A0, thereby maximizing our total points.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the Base Game

The payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 - **best total outcome**
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0  
- (A1, A1): Both get 3

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving payoff 5 each, and (A1, A1) giving payoff 3 each. The (A0, A0) outcome is clearly better for both players.

## Step 2: Identify the Problem

The risk is that we might coordinate on the inferior (A1, A1) equilibrium or fail to coordinate altogether. Additionally, A1 is "safer" since it guarantees at least 3 points regardless of what the other player does.

## Step 3: Design Contract Objectives

A good contract should:
1. **Strengthen (A0, A0) as the focal equilibrium** - ensure we coordinate on the best outcome
2. **Extract some value for myself** - since I'm designing it to maximize my points
3. **Be acceptable to the other player** - so they approve it (needs 2 votes to win)

## Step 4: Consider Contract Effects

If I propose {A0: c0, A1: c1}:
- When I play A0, I receive c0 additional points (other player pays c0)
- When I play A1, I receive c1 additional points (other player pays c1)

A contract with c0 > c1 makes A0 more attractive for me relative to A1, which helps coordination.

## Step 5: Choose Optimal Values

Setting **{A0: 1, A1: 0}**:
- (A0, A0) becomes: (6, 4) - still better than any other outcome for both
- I get a bonus for playing A0, incentivizing the cooperative choice
- The other player still gets 4 at (A0, A0), better than the 3 they'd get at (A1, A1)
- This should earn their approval while benefiting me

{"A0": 1, "A1": 0}

response:
Let’s break this down step by step to design an optimal contract that maximizes **your** total expected points in this game.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Normal Form)**
We are in a simultaneous-move game between two players. Here is the payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5,5    | 0,3    |
| **P1: A1**    | 3,0    | 3,3    |

This is **not** a standard prisoner's dilemma, but it has some similarities. Let’s analyze the pure strategy Nash equilibria.

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 prefers A0 (5 > 3)
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 prefers A1 (3 > 0)

So P1 has no dominant strategy. Similarly for P2.

Let’s find mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- P1 plays A0 with probability $ p $
- P2 plays A0 with probability $ q $

**P1’s expected payoff** (for being indifferent in equilibrium):
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1)
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1)

So P1 is indifferent when:
- Expected from A0: $ 5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q $
- Expected from A1: $ 3q + 3(1 - q) = 3 $
Set equal:
> $ 5q = 3 $ → $ q = 0.6 $

Similarly, for P2 to be indifferent:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1)

P2’s expected payoff from A0: $ 5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p $  
From A1: $ 3p + 3(1 - p) = 3 $

Set equal:
> $ 5p = 3 $ → $ p = 0.6 $

So the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** is:
- Both players play A0 with 60% chance, A1 with 40%.

**Expected payoff for each player in this equilibrium**:
Let’s compute it.

- (A0,A0): p*q = 0.6*0.6 = 0.36 → 5 points each
- (A0,A1): p*(1-q) = 0.6*0.4 = 0.24 → 0 for P1, 3 for P2
- (A1,A0): (1-p)*q = 0.4*0.6 = 0.24 → 3 for P1, 0 for P2
- (A1,A1): (1-p)*(1-q) = 0.4*0.4 = 0.16 → 3 each

P1’s expected payoff:
> 0.36*5 + 0.24*0 + 0.24*3 + 0.16*3 =  
> 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

Same for P2.

So in the default equilibrium, both get 3 points.

But is there a way to do better?

---

### **Step 2: Think About Contracts**

The key twist: we can propose a **contract**, which is an extra payoff attached to each action (A0 and A1), **on top** of the base game.

- The contract is a pair: (payoff for A0, payoff for A1) → integers (positive, negative, or zero)
- If both players **accept** the contract, it becomes active and modifies the total payoff.
- Contracts are proposed by both players.
- **Only one contract is picked.** The selection is via **approval voting**:
  - Each player can approve any number of contracts.
  - The contract(s) with **maximum approvals** are pooled.
  - One is chosen **uniformly at random** from that pool.
- You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, so you should design a contract that:
  1. Is likely to be accepted (by both players).
  2. Increases your expected payoff when it is active.
  3. Makes it appealing to the other player so they are likely to **approve** it.

So you need to **design a contract that is self-enforcing and mutually beneficial enough** to get both players to approve it.

---

### **Step 3: What Contract Could Be Acceptable?**

Let’s explore the **ideal outcome**.

We want an outcome where you both play **A0**, because:
- (A0,A0) gives **5 points to each** — better than the 3 in the equilibrium.

But why would the other player agree to play A0? Because if they play A1, they get 0 or 3, depending on you. But if you deviate, they lose.

But if you both play A0, you get 5 each — which is better than 3.

So **both players would benefit** from coordination on (A0,A0).

But the problem is **incentive compatibility**: in the base game, you don’t have an incentive to play A0 if the other plays A0 — because if you instead play A1, you get 3 (same as before) — but if the other plays A0, you get 3 instead of 5 — so you lose.

Wait: if the other player plays A0:
- You get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so A0 is better.

Yes — so when the other plays A0, you prefer A0.

Similarly, if the other plays A1, you get 0 from A0, 3 from A1 → so A1 is better.

So **A0 is a best response only if the other plays A0**.

So (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium?  
Check:
- P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A0 (5 > 3) → yes
- P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 (5 > 3) → yes

So **(A0,A0)** is actually a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**!

Wait — really?

Hold on: (A0,A0) → both get 5

- If P1 deviates to A1: gets 3 (worse)
- If P2 deviates to A1: gets 3 (worse)

So yes — (A0,A0) is a **Nash equilibrium**.

(A1,A1) is also an equilibrium: both get 3, and deviation gives 0 or 3? If you switch to A0, you get 3 (same) → no loss, but no gain.

Wait: in (A1,A1): you get 3. If you switch to A0 when the other plays A1, you get 0 → worse. So it’s not profitable to switch. So (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

So **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But (A0,A0) is better for both.

So why don't they coordinate on (A0,A0)? Because without communication or commitment, they might end up in (A1,A1) — the risk-dominant equilibrium?

But in this case, (A0,A0) has higher payoffs, so **Pareto dominates**.

The issue is **focal point** — but contracts can help.

---

### **Step 4: Design Contract to Encourage (A0,A0)**

We want to **make (A0,A0) the stable outcome**, possibly by altering incentives.

Let’s consider a contract that makes playing A0 more attractive — and even penalizes deviation.

Idea: **Reward A0, punish A1** — but in a way that is acceptable.

Suppose I propose a contract:

```json
{"A0": 2, "A1": -2}
```

So:
- If I play A0, I get +2 (extra) → total payoff from A0 action includes this.
- If I play A1, I pay -2 → lose 2 extra

But this is one-sided: **only affects me**.

The other player might not accept it — because I’m getting +2 just for playing A0, but they don’t benefit directly.

Wait — in the contract, **the payoff is *shared*.**

Important note: the contract says:

> "the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s)"

So **if I propose a positive value for A0**, I receive X from the other player.

But that means: **when I play A0, I get +X, and the other player pays X**.

Similarly, if I specify a negative number for A1, I pay X, which is distributed to the other player.

So **the contract is an extra transfer between players**, based on what action you take.

So the **total sum of all contract payments is preserved** — it's just a transfer.

So if I set:
```json
{"A0": +2, "A1": -2}
```
This means:
- If I play A0: I get +2 (from the other player), so I gain, they lose.
- If I play A1: I lose 2 (to the other player), so I pay 2, they gain.

So **the contract is a way to shift money**, depending on action.

Now, if I want to encourage **me and the other player to play A0**, I can:

- **Reward A0**: gain more when I play A0.
- **Punish A1**: lose money if I play A1.

But I must make it **acceptable** to the other player — otherwise they won’t approve.

So the **contract must be beneficial or at least neutral** for both players, **on average**, to have a good chance of being approved.

Let’s suppose both players **actually play A0** in the contract. Then:
- I get +2 from the contract.
- The other player pays me 2 → so they get -2.

So they lose. They won’t like that unless they get a better deal from the base game.

But in (A0,A0), base payoff is 5 → but with contract, I get 5 + 2 = 7, they get 5 - 2 = 3 → worse off.

So they'd reject.

What if I offer a **balanced contract**?

Idea: **Let me pay the other player when I play A0**, so they prefer A0.

But I want to make **A0** better for *them*.

So if I set:
- A0: -1 (I pay 1 to the other player)
- A1: +1 (I gain 1 from the other player)

So:
- If I play A0: I pay 1, they gain 1
- If I play A1: I gain 1, they pay 1

Now, think about **what the other player prefers**:
- If I play A0: they get +1 → better
- If I play A1: they get -1 → worse

So they want me to play A0.

And **I** want to play A0 as well? Only if the base game is good.

Let’s suppose both players **agree to coordinate on A0**, and we **both follow the contract**.

Then:
- I play A0 → pay 1 → I get -1 from contract
- But base payoff from (A0,A0) = 5 → total: 5 - 1 = 4
- Other player: gets +1 from contract → total: 5 + 1 = 6

So I get less, they get more.

So I’d want to avoid that.

So this contract **makes me worse off if I play A0**, even though I want to.

But maybe I can *offer* a contract that **benefits both of us when playing A0**, but I need to transfer money to encourage coordination.

Wait — perhaps we can **both get more** by coordinating on A0, so we can **split the surplus**.

In (A0,A0), we get 5 each — but in equilibrium, we only get 3.

So **we have a surplus of 2 each** from coordinating on A0.

So **total surplus of 4**.

So if I can design a contract where:
- Both players are better off when playing A0
- The surplus is split fairly

Then both might approve.

But how?

Let’s suppose I design a contract:

```json
{"A0": +1, "A1": -1}
```

So:
- If I play A0: I get +1 (from other player)
- If I play A1: I lose 1 (give to other player)

So **I benefit from playing A0**, and **I hurt when I play A1**.

Now, what if the **other player also proposes a contract**?

But remember: only **one contract** will be chosen — the one with **most approvals**.

So I want my contract to be **approved by both players** — so I have to make it **appealing to the other player**.

So let’s suppose **I propose**:
```json
{"A0": +1, "A1": -1}
```

What does this do?

- If **I play A0**: I gain +1 from contract → so from base game, I get 5 + 1 = 6 (if others A0), or 0 + 1 = 1 (if others A1)
- If **I play A1**: I lose 1 → so base payoff + (-1) = 3 - 1 = 2 (if others A1), or 3 - 1 = 2 (if others A0) — but wait, if others play A0, and I switch to A1, I get 3 base + (-1) = 2

Compare:
- If others play A0: I get 5 + 1 = 6 (if A0), or 3 - 1 = 2 (if A1) → so A0 is much better
- If others play A1: I get 0 + 1 = 1 (if A0), or 3 - 1 = 2 (if A1) → so A1 is still better

So **only if the other plays A0** do I want to play A0.

But if they play A1, I still prefer A1.

So this contract encourages coordination **only if** the other plays A0.

But the other player sees:

- If I play A0: they pay me 1 → so they get 5 - 1 = 4 (if I play A0) or 3 - 1 = 2 (if I play A1)

Wait no: **contract is defined from the perspective of the proposer**.

In my contract:
- I am the one defining the values.

So:
- If **I play A0**, I get +1 (from you)
- If **I play A1**, I pay 1 (to you)

So for **you**, the other player:
- When **I** play A0: you **lose 1**
- When **I** play A1: you **gain 1**

So your **expected contract payoff** depends on what *I* do.

So if **you play A0**, and I play A0: you get 5 (base) -1 (contract) = 4
- If I play A1: you get 3 (base) +1 (contract) = 4

So if you play A0, you get 4 regardless of what I do?
- If I play A0: 5 -1 = 4
- If I play A1: 3 +1 = 4

Interesting. So **if you play A0**, you get 4 (contract-adjusted) no matter what I do.

If you play A1:
- If I play A0: you get 3 (base) -1 (contract) = 2
- If I play A1: you get 3 (base) +1 (contract) = 4

So:
- If you play A0: you get 4
- If you play A1: you get 4 if I play A1, 2 if I play A0

So **you are indifferent if I play A1**, but **prefer A0 if I play A0**

But **you don’t know what I will do**.

So your **expected utility depends on what you think I will do**.

But you want to **maximize your expected utility**, and you want to approve the contract.

Now: if the contract is active, then you **can** play optimally.

Let’s suppose **both players are rational and believe the contract will be active**.

Then what is the best **response**?

Let’s suppose the contract is active, and both know this.

Then:

For **you (Player 2)**:
- If you play A0: you get 4 always (from above: 5-1=4 if I play A0, 3+1=4 if I play A1)
- If you play A1: you get 4 only if I play A1, 2 if I play A0

So your expected payoff depends on **my mixed strategy**.

But suppose I play A0 with high probability.

But I want to **coordinate on A0**.

Suppose **you believe I will play A0**.

Then:
- If you play A0: you get 4
- If you play A1: you get 2 (since I play A0 → you get 3 base +1 from me = 4? Wait no.

Wait: if **I play A0**, then:
- I get +1 from contract
- You get -1 from contract

So:
- Base payoff: (A0,A0) → 5 each + contract: you lose 1 → total 4
- (A1,A0): base → you get 0, contract → you get -1 → total -1

Wait — I think I made a mistake.

Clarify:

Contract is in **your** (Player 1’s) statement.

So when **I** (P1) play **A0**, I get +1 (from you), so you lose 1.

When **I** play **A1**, I lose 1 (to you), so you gain 1.

So your payoff from contract depends **on my action**.

So:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Your previous response was:
Let’s break this down step by step to design an optimal contract that maximizes **your** total expected points in this game.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Normal Form)**
We are in a simultaneous-move game between two players. Here is the payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5,5    | 0,3    |
| **P1: A1**    | 3,0    | 3,3    |

This is **not** a standard prisoner's dilemma, but it has some similarities. Let’s analyze the pure strategy Nash equilibria.

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 prefers A0 (5 > 3)
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 prefers A1 (3 > 0)

So P1 has no dominant strategy. Similarly for P2.

Let’s find mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- P1 plays A0 with probability $ p $
- P2 plays A0 with probability $ q $

**P1’s expected payoff** (for being indifferent in equilibrium):
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1)
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1)

So P1 is indifferent when:
- Expected from A0: $ 5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q $
- Expected from A1: $ 3q + 3(1 - q) = 3 $
Set equal:
> $ 5q = 3 $ → $ q = 0.6 $

Similarly, for P2 to be indifferent:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1)

P2’s expected payoff from A0: $ 5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p $  
From A1: $ 3p + 3(1 - p) = 3 $

Set equal:
> $ 5p = 3 $ → $ p = 0.6 $

So the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** is:
- Both players play A0 with 60% chance, A1 with 40%.

**Expected payoff for each player in this equilibrium**:
Let’s compute it.

- (A0,A0): p*q = 0.6*0.6 = 0.36 → 5 points each
- (A0,A1): p*(1-q) = 0.6*0.4 = 0.24 → 0 for P1, 3 for P2
- (A1,A0): (1-p)*q = 0.4*0.6 = 0.24 → 3 for P1, 0 for P2
- (A1,A1): (1-p)*(1-q) = 0.4*0.4 = 0.16 → 3 each

P1’s expected payoff:
> 0.36*5 + 0.24*0 + 0.24*3 + 0.16*3 =  
> 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

Same for P2.

So in the default equilibrium, both get 3 points.

But is there a way to do better?

---

### **Step 2: Think About Contracts**

The key twist: we can propose a **contract**, which is an extra payoff attached to each action (A0 and A1), **on top** of the base game.

- The contract is a pair: (payoff for A0, payoff for A1) → integers (positive, negative, or zero)
- If both players **accept** the contract, it becomes active and modifies the total payoff.
- Contracts are proposed by both players.
- **Only one contract is picked.** The selection is via **approval voting**:
  - Each player can approve any number of contracts.
  - The contract(s) with **maximum approvals** are pooled.
  - One is chosen **uniformly at random** from that pool.
- You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, so you should design a contract that:
  1. Is likely to be accepted (by both players).
  2. Increases your expected payoff when it is active.
  3. Makes it appealing to the other player so they are likely to **approve** it.

So you need to **design a contract that is self-enforcing and mutually beneficial enough** to get both players to approve it.

---

### **Step 3: What Contract Could Be Acceptable?**

Let’s explore the **ideal outcome**.

We want an outcome where you both play **A0**, because:
- (A0,A0) gives **5 points to each** — better than the 3 in the equilibrium.

But why would the other player agree to play A0? Because if they play A1, they get 0 or 3, depending on you. But if you deviate, they lose.

But if you both play A0, you get 5 each — which is better than 3.

So **both players would benefit** from coordination on (A0,A0).

But the problem is **incentive compatibility**: in the base game, you don’t have an incentive to play A0 if the other plays A0 — because if you instead play A1, you get 3 (same as before) — but if the other plays A0, you get 3 instead of 5 — so you lose.

Wait: if the other player plays A0:
- You get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so A0 is better.

Yes — so when the other plays A0, you prefer A0.

Similarly, if the other plays A1, you get 0 from A0, 3 from A1 → so A1 is better.

So **A0 is a best response only if the other plays A0**.

So (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium?  
Check:
- P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A0 (5 > 3) → yes
- P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 (5 > 3) → yes

So **(A0,A0)** is actually a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**!

Wait — really?

Hold on: (A0,A0) → both get 5

- If P1 deviates to A1: gets 3 (worse)
- If P2 deviates to A1: gets 3 (worse)

So yes — (A0,A0) is a **Nash equilibrium**.

(A1,A1) is also an equilibrium: both get 3, and deviation gives 0 or 3? If you switch to A0, you get 3 (same) → no loss, but no gain.

Wait: in (A1,A1): you get 3. If you switch to A0 when the other plays A1, you get 0 → worse. So it’s not profitable to switch. So (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

So **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But (A0,A0) is better for both.

So why don't they coordinate on (A0,A0)? Because without communication or commitment, they might end up in (A1,A1) — the risk-dominant equilibrium?

But in this case, (A0,A0) has higher payoffs, so **Pareto dominates**.

The issue is **focal point** — but contracts can help.

---

### **Step 4: Design Contract to Encourage (A0,A0)**

We want to **make (A0,A0) the stable outcome**, possibly by altering incentives.

Let’s consider a contract that makes playing A0 more attractive — and even penalizes deviation.

Idea: **Reward A0, punish A1** — but in a way that is acceptable.

Suppose I propose a contract:

```json
{"A0": 2, "A1": -2}
```

So:
- If I play A0, I get +2 (extra) → total payoff from A0 action includes this.
- If I play A1, I pay -2 → lose 2 extra

But this is one-sided: **only affects me**.

The other player might not accept it — because I’m getting +2 just for playing A0, but they don’t benefit directly.

Wait — in the contract, **the payoff is *shared*.**

Important note: the contract says:

> "the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s)"

So **if I propose a positive value for A0**, I receive X from the other player.

But that means: **when I play A0, I get +X, and the other player pays X**.

Similarly, if I specify a negative number for A1, I pay X, which is distributed to the other player.

So **the contract is an extra transfer between players**, based on what action you take.

So the **total sum of all contract payments is preserved** — it's just a transfer.

So if I set:
```json
{"A0": +2, "A1": -2}
```
This means:
- If I play A0: I get +2 (from the other player), so I gain, they lose.
- If I play A1: I lose 2 (to the other player), so I pay 2, they gain.

So **the contract is a way to shift money**, depending on action.

Now, if I want to encourage **me and the other player to play A0**, I can:

- **Reward A0**: gain more when I play A0.
- **Punish A1**: lose money if I play A1.

But I must make it **acceptable** to the other player — otherwise they won’t approve.

So the **contract must be beneficial or at least neutral** for both players, **on average**, to have a good chance of being approved.

Let’s suppose both players **actually play A0** in the contract. Then:
- I get +2 from the contract.
- The other player pays me 2 → so they get -2.

So they lose. They won’t like that unless they get a better deal from the base game.

But in (A0,A0), base payoff is 5 → but with contract, I get 5 + 2 = 7, they get 5 - 2 = 3 → worse off.

So they'd reject.

What if I offer a **balanced contract**?

Idea: **Let me pay the other player when I play A0**, so they prefer A0.

But I want to make **A0** better for *them*.

So if I set:
- A0: -1 (I pay 1 to the other player)
- A1: +1 (I gain 1 from the other player)

So:
- If I play A0: I pay 1, they gain 1
- If I play A1: I gain 1, they pay 1

Now, think about **what the other player prefers**:
- If I play A0: they get +1 → better
- If I play A1: they get -1 → worse

So they want me to play A0.

And **I** want to play A0 as well? Only if the base game is good.

Let’s suppose both players **agree to coordinate on A0**, and we **both follow the contract**.

Then:
- I play A0 → pay 1 → I get -1 from contract
- But base payoff from (A0,A0) = 5 → total: 5 - 1 = 4
- Other player: gets +1 from contract → total: 5 + 1 = 6

So I get less, they get more.

So I’d want to avoid that.

So this contract **makes me worse off if I play A0**, even though I want to.

But maybe I can *offer* a contract that **benefits both of us when playing A0**, but I need to transfer money to encourage coordination.

Wait — perhaps we can **both get more** by coordinating on A0, so we can **split the surplus**.

In (A0,A0), we get 5 each — but in equilibrium, we only get 3.

So **we have a surplus of 2 each** from coordinating on A0.

So **total surplus of 4**.

So if I can design a contract where:
- Both players are better off when playing A0
- The surplus is split fairly

Then both might approve.

But how?

Let’s suppose I design a contract:

```json
{"A0": +1, "A1": -1}
```

So:
- If I play A0: I get +1 (from other player)
- If I play A1: I lose 1 (give to other player)

So **I benefit from playing A0**, and **I hurt when I play A1**.

Now, what if the **other player also proposes a contract**?

But remember: only **one contract** will be chosen — the one with **most approvals**.

So I want my contract to be **approved by both players** — so I have to make it **appealing to the other player**.

So let’s suppose **I propose**:
```json
{"A0": +1, "A1": -1}
```

What does this do?

- If **I play A0**: I gain +1 from contract → so from base game, I get 5 + 1 = 6 (if others A0), or 0 + 1 = 1 (if others A1)
- If **I play A1**: I lose 1 → so base payoff + (-1) = 3 - 1 = 2 (if others A1), or 3 - 1 = 2 (if others A0) — but wait, if others play A0, and I switch to A1, I get 3 base + (-1) = 2

Compare:
- If others play A0: I get 5 + 1 = 6 (if A0), or 3 - 1 = 2 (if A1) → so A0 is much better
- If others play A1: I get 0 + 1 = 1 (if A0), or 3 - 1 = 2 (if A1) → so A1 is still better

So **only if the other plays A0** do I want to play A0.

But if they play A1, I still prefer A1.

So this contract encourages coordination **only if** the other plays A0.

But the other player sees:

- If I play A0: they pay me 1 → so they get 5 - 1 = 4 (if I play A0) or 3 - 1 = 2 (if I play A1)

Wait no: **contract is defined from the perspective of the proposer**.

In my contract:
- I am the one defining the values.

So:
- If **I play A0**, I get +1 (from you)
- If **I play A1**, I pay 1 (to you)

So for **you**, the other player:
- When **I** play A0: you **lose 1**
- When **I** play A1: you **gain 1**

So your **expected contract payoff** depends on what *I* do.

So if **you play A0**, and I play A0: you get 5 (base) -1 (contract) = 4
- If I play A1: you get 3 (base) +1 (contract) = 4

So if you play A0, you get 4 regardless of what I do?
- If I play A0: 5 -1 = 4
- If I play A1: 3 +1 = 4

Interesting. So **if you play A0**, you get 4 (contract-adjusted) no matter what I do.

If you play A1:
- If I play A0: you get 3 (base) -1 (contract) = 2
- If I play A1: you get 3 (base) +1 (contract) = 4

So:
- If you play A0: you get 4
- If you play A1: you get 4 if I play A1, 2 if I play A0

So **you are indifferent if I play A1**, but **prefer A0 if I play A0**

But **you don’t know what I will do**.

So your **expected utility depends on what you think I will do**.

But you want to **maximize your expected utility**, and you want to approve the contract.

Now: if the contract is active, then you **can** play optimally.

Let’s suppose **both players are rational and believe the contract will be active**.

Then what is the best **response**?

Let’s suppose the contract is active, and both know this.

Then:

For **you (Player 2)**:
- If you play A0: you get 4 always (from above: 5-1=4 if I play A0, 3+1=4 if I play A1)
- If you play A1: you get 4 only if I play A1, 2 if I play A0

So your expected payoff depends on **my mixed strategy**.

But suppose I play A0 with high probability.

But I want to **coordinate on A0**.

Suppose **you believe I will play A0**.

Then:
- If you play A0: you get 4
- If you play A1: you get 2 (since I play A0 → you get 3 base +1 from me = 4? Wait no.

Wait: if **I play A0**, then:
- I get +1 from contract
- You get -1 from contract

So:
- Base payoff: (A0,A0) → 5 each + contract: you lose 1 → total 4
- (A1,A0): base → you get 0, contract → you get -1 → total -1

Wait — I think I made a mistake.

Clarify:

Contract is in **your** (Player 1’s) statement.

So when **I** (P1) play **A0**, I get +1 (from you), so you lose 1.

When **I** play **A1**, I lose 1 (to you), so you gain 1.

So your payoff from contract depends **on my action**.

Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:

    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though.

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Game Structure

As Player 2, my payoff matrix is:
```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Player 2  A0    5,5     0,3
          A1    3,0     3,3
```

## Step 2: Identify the Strategic Problem

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0) = (5, 5)** - Pareto optimal, but risky
- **(A1, A1) = (3, 3)** - Safe but suboptimal

The risk: If I play A0 and Player 1 plays A1, I get 0 (my worst outcome).

## Step 3: Determine Contract Objectives

A good contract should:
1. Help coordinate on the better (A0, A0) outcome
2. Be attractive enough for Player 1 to approve
3. Not hurt me too badly if coordination fails

## Step 4: Evaluate Contract Options

**Option A: Reward my A0** (e.g., {"A0": +2, "A1": 0})
- Makes (A0, A0) become (7, 3) 
- Player 1 gets only 3 instead of 5 → Won't approve

**Option B: Penalize my A1** (e.g., {"A0": 0, "A1": -1})
- Makes (A0, A0) stay (5, 5)
- Makes (A1, A1) become (2, 4)
- This credibly signals I'm more likely to play A0
- Player 1 gets a "bonus" if we miscoordinate on (A1, A1) → More likely to approve

## Step 5: Strategic Reasoning

By penalizing my own A1:
- I commit to favoring A0, making it safer for Player 1 to also choose A0
- This helps us coordinate on the Pareto optimal (5, 5) outcome
- Player 1 benefits from the penalty payment if we end up at (A1, A1), giving them incentive to approve
- It's a credible commitment device that reduces coordination risk

response:
Let’s walk through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game**

We are playing a simultaneous move game with two players. Each chooses either A0 or A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) — note: you are **Player 2** in this setup:

|           | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **You (P2): A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **You (P2): A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

So the matrix from **your (Player 2)** perspective:

- If you play A0:
  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 5
  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 3
- If you play A1:
  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 0
  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 3

Now, let’s analyze the **dominant strategies** in the base game.

### **Step 2: Find Nash Equilibria of the Base Game**

Let’s find best responses.

#### Player 2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - You get 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - You get 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent

So your best response: **A0 if P1 plays A0, and indifferent if P1 plays A1**

#### Player 1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent

So P1’s best response: **A0 if P2 plays A0, indifferent otherwise**

Now, NE:
- (A0, A0): both get 5 → each has no incentive to deviate → **Nash Equilibrium**
- (A1, A1): both get 3. But if P1 deviates to A0 while P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 3 → no gain. P2 same. So both get 3, and neither can improve → **Another NE**
- (A0, A1): you (P2) get 3, P1 gets 0 → P2 is happy, but P1 can switch to A0 and get 5 → not equilibrium
- (A1, A0): you get 0, P1 gets 3 → P2 can deviate to A0 and get 5 → not equilibrium

So the **pure strategy Nash equilibria** are:
- (A0, A0): payoff (5,5)
- (A1, A1): payoff (3,3)

There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium. But since we’re going to introduce a **contract**, we want to **influence behavior** toward a desirable outcome.

---

### **Step 3: Why Introduce a Contract?**

The key is that the contract:
- Is an **additional** payoff rule.
- Must be **accepted by both players** to take effect.
- Is activated only if both accept.

So we need to **design a contract** that:
1. Incentivizes the other player to choose actions that lead to **your preferred outcome**
2. Is **attractive enough** to get them to accept
3. Is **self-enforcing** in the sense that you don’t lose from playing it — otherwise you’d never accept

You want to maximize your **total expected points**, so you'll design a contract that helps achieve a better outcome than the default baseline.

---

### **Step 4: Your Ideal Outcome**

You want to maximize your payoff.

The best possible outcome for you (Player 2) is **(A0, A0)**, where you get **5**.

In the NE (A0, A0), both get 5.

But (A1, A1) gives you only 3.

So your **ideal outcome is (A0, A0)**.

But can you incentivize the other player to play A0?

Note: The other player will only play A0 if doing so is in *their* interest — especially when they see your contract.

---

### **Step 5: What If You Propose a Contract?**

Let’s suppose you propose a contract that says:

- If you (Player 2) play A0 → you **receive X** extra
- If you play A1 → you **receive Y**

But **X and Y are signed**:
- Positive: you receive money (from the other player)
- Negative: you pay money (to the other player)

The **payment is drawn equally from the other player**.

So for example:
- If you get +5 for playing A0, then the other player must pay 5 total (like minus 5) if you play A0.
- But this is **only if the contract is accepted and active**.

Important: **The contract only applies if both players accept it.**

So you must make it **appealing** to the other player.

Let’s now think strategically.

---

### **Step 6: Designing a Contract That Encourages (A0, A0)**

You want **both players to choose A0**.

But currently, in the base game, P1 will play A0 only if they expect P2 to play A0.

But if P2 plays A1, P1 is indifferent (both give P1 3), so P1 will play A0 if they believe P2 plays A0.

Now, **can you make P1 want to play A0 even if P2 might deviate?**

Let’s suppose you **make A0 more attractive to yourself**, and **align incentives**.

But remember: if you get extra points for playing A0, then you’re more likely to play A0.

If the other player sees that you are **more likely to play A0**, they may have an incentive to play A0 too.

But here’s a better idea:

### Let’s design a contract that **makes (A0, A0) the best response** for the other player.

Suppose you **pay them to play A0**, and **punish them for playing A1**?

Wait — but you have to define how much you give/pay for **your** actions.

Ah! The contract is **on your own actions** — not theirs.

The contract specifies:
- If **you** play A0 → you get +X (paid by opponent)
- If **you** play A1 → you get +Y (paid by opponent)

So you cannot directly make them pay if they play A1.

But you can **adjust the payoff to yourself** based on your own action.

So if you make **playing A0 more valuable for you**, you are more likely to play it.

If you make **playing A1 more costly for you**, you’ll avoid it.

So strategy:
- Make **A0 attractive** to you
- Make **A1 costly** for you

This way, you are more likely to play A0.

Now, if the other player sees that you are likely to play A0, they will want to play A0 too (because it gives them 5, vs 3 if they play A1).

So **you can shift the equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 7: Suppose You Commit to Playing A0**

Let’s try to **induce** the other player to play A0.

Suppose you want to make yourself **get a high payoff for playing A0**, so you'll always play A0.

But you must design the contract so that you **want to play A0**, and the other player **wants them to play A0 because you will**.

So:

Let’s suppose you set:
- A0: +5 (you get +5 if you play A0)
- A1: -3 (you pay 3 if you play A1)

Then your expected payoff depends on what you do.

But you’ll only play A1 if you get more than if you play A0.

But if A0 gives you +5 (extra), and A1 gives you -3 (you pay), you **won’t play A1 at all**.

So you’ll **always play A0** if the contract is accepted.

Now, if you play A0, and the other player knows this, what should they do?

- If they play A0 → they get 5 (base) + 0 (no extra for them) → 5
- If they play A1 → they get 3 (base) + 0 → 3

So they will play A0.

So equilibrium becomes: both play A0 → you get 5 (base) + 5 (contract) = 10? Wait — **no**.

Wait: **contract only adds to your payoff**, and it’s **not shared per play**, but **total**.

Wait: the contract says “the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s)”.

This is ambiguous.

But interpretation: **whenever you choose an action, the contract specifies a net transfer.**

For example:
- If you play A0, you **get X points** from the other player (so the other player pays X to you).
- If you play A1, you **pay Y points** to the other player (so you pay Y).

So this happens **once**, based on your action.

So final total payoff = base payoff + contract payoff.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get base + X
- If you play A1 → you get base - Y (if Y is positive)

Now, in your contract:
- If you play A0 → you get +X (money from other player)
- If you play A1 → you pay Y (to other player) → so your payoff decreases

So you want to make X large and Y large.

But you must **get the other player to accept** the contract.

Because the contract only activates if **both accept**.

So you need to design a contract that is **acceptable to the other player**.

---

### **Step 8: Trust and Acceptance**

Suppose you propose:
- A0: +10 → you get 10 extra if you play A0
- A1: -10 → you pay 10 if you play A1

Then you will **never play A1** — because you’d lose 10.

So you play A0.

Then other player, seeing you will play A0, will play A0 too (since 5 > 3).

So you get 5 (base) + 10 (contract) = 15.

Other player gets 5 (base) + (they pay 10) = -5.

So the other player is **very unhappy**.

They will **not accept** such a contract.

So you need a contract that:
- Makes you want to play A0
- Makes **them want to accept** the contract

So what should they gain?

The contract specifies **only your payoff**. The other player’s cost is just that you get more when you play A0, so they have to pay.

So if you get +X for A0, they have to pay X.

If you get -Y for A1, they get Y.

So total payoff to them: base payoff + (whatever they get from you)

So:
- If they play A0: base 5, and they pay X → net = 5 - X
- If they play A1: base 3, and they get Y (because you pay them Y if you play A1) → net = 3 + Y

But since you will **never play A1**, Y is never paid.

So only X is paid (if you play A0).

So your **expected** contract payout: X, with probability 1.

So your **total** payoff: base + X = 5 + X

Other player’s payoff: base - X = 5 - X (if they play A0) or 3 + Y (if they play A1, but Y never paid)

But since you play A0 for sure, if they play A0, they get 5 - X.

They will play A0 only if 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2 (since 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2)

Wait — is that right?

Wait: they get 5 (base) if they play A0, but lose X due to the contract (because you play A0 and they pay X) → so net: 5 - X

If they play A1, they get 3 (base), and since you don’t play A1, they don’t receive Y → so net: 3

So they prefer A0 if 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2

So if X > 2, they prefer A1.

But if they play A1, you get 0 (base) + X (from contract) = X

But you are committed to playing A0, no matter what — because if you played A1 you’d lose Y.

But in your contract, if you play A1 you pay Y, so you **won’t** play A1.

So you **will** play A0.

Then if other player plays A1, your payoff is: base 0 + X = X

They get: base 3 + 0 = 3

So if X > 0, you prefer A1 for yourself? No.

Wait — the problem is that **if you commit to playing A0**, you get base 5 (with A0) + X = 5 + X

But if you were to play A1, you'd get base 0 (if they play A1) + (-Y) = -Y

So you **definitely prefer A0**.

But if you play A0, and they play A1, you get 0 base + X = X

But you get X, but base is only 0?

Wait — no:

- Your action: A0
- Their action: A1
- Base payoff: you get 0 (from matrix), they get 3

Then contract: you get X (for playing A0) → so total: 0 + X

So your payoff = X

But you would rather get 5 (if they play A0) + X = 5 + X

So if they play A1, you get only X

So if X < 5, you’d prefer them to play A0

But you cannot force them to play A0 — only your own behavior.

But you **will play A0 regardless**, because A1 costs you Y.

So you play A0.

Now, can you make it so that the other player **wants to play A0**?

They get:
- If play A0: base 5 - X (because you play A0 and they pay X)
- If play A1: base 3 (and no contract payment, since you don’t play A1)

So they prefer A0 if: 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2

So to **incentivize** them to play A0, you need X ≤ 2

Now, you also want to **maximize your own payoff**

You play A0 for sure.

So your final payoff depends on **their action**.

- If they play A0: you get base 5 + X (contract) → 5 + X
- If they play A1: you get base 0 + X → X

So your **expected** payoff (if you assume they play optimally) depends on what they prefer.

If X ≤ 2, they play A0 → you get 5 + X

If X > 2, they play A1 → you get X

So let’s compare:
- If X ≤ 2: you get 5 + X, maximized at X = 2 → you get 7
- If X > 2: you get X

So if X = 3, you get 3

But 3 < 7

So best is to set X = 2, then you get 7

And they get 5 - 2 = 3, which is equal to what they get if they play A1 (3), so they are **indifferent** — but since they are indifferent, we can assume they play A0.

So you get 5 + 2 = 7

But is there a better way?

Wait — you can also **make A1 costly** for you — i.e., set negative value for A1.

But you didn’t use that yet.

In the above, you only set A0: +2, A1: 0?

But if A1 gives 0 (no contract payment), then you get base payoff + 0.

But if you play A1, you get:
- 0 (if they play A0) → total 0
- 3 (if they play A1) → total 3

But if you are playing A0, you wouldn’t play A1 — so only the contract matters for when you play A1.

But if you set A1 to be **negative**, that makes you **hate** playing A1.

But suppose you set:
- A0: +2
- A1: -5

Then you definitely won’t play A1 — because even if you get 3 base, you lose 5 → get -2

So better to play A0 and get 5 + 2 = 7

Still, when you play A0, you get +2

But now, your previous analysis holds: if they play A0, you get 5 + 2 = 7; if they play A1, you get 0 + 2 = 2

So you want them to play A0 → only if 5 - 2 = 3 ≥ 3 → equal → they are indifferent → assume they play A0.

So payoff 7.

Can we do better?

Suppose we make **A1 give you a bonus** when you play it?

But if A1 gives you +5, you might be tempted to play it, but then if they play A0, you get 0 + 5 = 5 — but you want to avoid that because they get 0, but you get only 5.

But if they play A1, you get 3 + 5 = 8 — so **you might prefer A1**.

But then you’re not committing to A0 — so it fails to incentivize them.

So **only good if you never play A1**.

So we must ensure:
- A0 is better than A1 for you

So you need **contract value of A0 > contract value of A1** (adjusted by base payoffs)

But base payoffs differ.

Let’s define:
- If you play A0: total payoff = base_A0 + contract_A0
- If you play A

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Let’s walk through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game**

We are playing a simultaneous move game with two players. Each chooses either A0 or A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) — note: you are **Player 2** in this setup:

|           | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **You (P2): A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **You (P2): A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

So the matrix from **your (Player 2)** perspective:

- If you play A0:
  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 5
  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 3
- If you play A1:
  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 0
  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 3

Now, let’s analyze the **dominant strategies** in the base game.

### **Step 2: Find Nash Equilibria of the Base Game**

Let’s find best responses.

#### Player 2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - You get 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - You get 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent

So your best response: **A0 if P1 plays A0, and indifferent if P1 plays A1**

#### Player 1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent

So P1’s best response: **A0 if P2 plays A0, indifferent otherwise**

Now, NE:
- (A0, A0): both get 5 → each has no incentive to deviate → **Nash Equilibrium**
- (A1, A1): both get 3. But if P1 deviates to A0 while P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 3 → no gain. P2 same. So both get 3, and neither can improve → **Another NE**
- (A0, A1): you (P2) get 3, P1 gets 0 → P2 is happy, but P1 can switch to A0 and get 5 → not equilibrium
- (A1, A0): you get 0, P1 gets 3 → P2 can deviate to A0 and get 5 → not equilibrium

So the **pure strategy Nash equilibria** are:
- (A0, A0): payoff (5,5)
- (A1, A1): payoff (3,3)

There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium. But since we’re going to introduce a **contract**, we want to **influence behavior** toward a desirable outcome.

---

### **Step 3: Why Introduce a Contract?**

The key is that the contract:
- Is an **additional** payoff rule.
- Must be **accepted by both players** to take effect.
- Is activated only if both accept.

So we need to **design a contract** that:
1. Incentivizes the other player to choose actions that lead to **your preferred outcome**
2. Is **attractive enough** to get them to accept
3. Is **self-enforcing** in the sense that you don’t lose from playing it — otherwise you’d never accept

You want to maximize your **total expected points**, so you'll design a contract that helps achieve a better outcome than the default baseline.

---

### **Step 4: Your Ideal Outcome**

You want to maximize your payoff.

The best possible outcome for you (Player 2) is **(A0, A0)**, where you get **5**.

In the NE (A0, A0), both get 5.

But (A1, A1) gives you only 3.

So your **ideal outcome is (A0, A0)**.

But can you incentivize the other player to play A0?

Note: The other player will only play A0 if doing so is in *their* interest — especially when they see your contract.

---

### **Step 5: What If You Propose a Contract?**

Let’s suppose you propose a contract that says:

- If you (Player 2) play A0 → you **receive X** extra
- If you play A1 → you **receive Y**

But **X and Y are signed**:
- Positive: you receive money (from the other player)
- Negative: you pay money (to the other player)

The **payment is drawn equally from the other player**.

So for example:
- If you get +5 for playing A0, then the other player must pay 5 total (like minus 5) if you play A0.
- But this is **only if the contract is accepted and active**.

Important: **The contract only applies if both players accept it.**

So you must make it **appealing** to the other player.

Let’s now think strategically.

---

### **Step 6: Designing a Contract That Encourages (A0, A0)**

You want **both players to choose A0**.

But currently, in the base game, P1 will play A0 only if they expect P2 to play A0.

But if P2 plays A1, P1 is indifferent (both give P1 3), so P1 will play A0 if they believe P2 plays A0.

Now, **can you make P1 want to play A0 even if P2 might deviate?**

Let’s suppose you **make A0 more attractive to yourself**, and **align incentives**.

But remember: if you get extra points for playing A0, then you’re more likely to play A0.

If the other player sees that you are **more likely to play A0**, they may have an incentive to play A0 too.

But here’s a better idea:

### Let’s design a contract that **makes (A0, A0) the best response** for the other player.

Suppose you **pay them to play A0**, and **punish them for playing A1**?

Wait — but you have to define how much you give/pay for **your** actions.

Ah! The contract is **on your own actions** — not theirs.

The contract specifies:
- If **you** play A0 → you get +X (paid by opponent)
- If **you** play A1 → you get +Y (paid by opponent)

So you cannot directly make them pay if they play A1.

But you can **adjust the payoff to yourself** based on your own action.

So if you make **playing A0 more valuable for you**, you are more likely to play it.

If you make **playing A1 more costly for you**, you’ll avoid it.

So strategy:
- Make **A0 attractive** to you
- Make **A1 costly** for you

This way, you are more likely to play A0.

Now, if the other player sees that you are likely to play A0, they will want to play A0 too (because it gives them 5, vs 3 if they play A1).

So **you can shift the equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 7: Suppose You Commit to Playing A0**

Let’s try to **induce** the other player to play A0.

Suppose you want to make yourself **get a high payoff for playing A0**, so you'll always play A0.

But you must design the contract so that you **want to play A0**, and the other player **wants them to play A0 because you will**.

So:

Let’s suppose you set:
- A0: +5 (you get +5 if you play A0)
- A1: -3 (you pay 3 if you play A1)

Then your expected payoff depends on what you do.

But you’ll only play A1 if you get more than if you play A0.

But if A0 gives you +5 (extra), and A1 gives you -3 (you pay), you **won’t play A1 at all**.

So you’ll **always play A0** if the contract is accepted.

Now, if you play A0, and the other player knows this, what should they do?

- If they play A0 → they get 5 (base) + 0 (no extra for them) → 5
- If they play A1 → they get 3 (base) + 0 → 3

So they will play A0.

So equilibrium becomes: both play A0 → you get 5 (base) + 5 (contract) = 10? Wait — **no**.

Wait: **contract only adds to your payoff**, and it’s **not shared per play**, but **total**.

Wait: the contract says “the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s)”.

This is ambiguous.

But interpretation: **whenever you choose an action, the contract specifies a net transfer.**

For example:
- If you play A0, you **get X points** from the other player (so the other player pays X to you).
- If you play A1, you **pay Y points** to the other player (so you pay Y).

So this happens **once**, based on your action.

So final total payoff = base payoff + contract payoff.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get base + X
- If you play A1 → you get base - Y (if Y is positive)

Now, in your contract:
- If you play A0 → you get +X (money from other player)
- If you play A1 → you pay Y (to other player) → so your payoff decreases

So you want to make X large and Y large.

But you must **get the other player to accept** the contract.

Because the contract only activates if **both accept**.

So you need to design a contract that is **acceptable to the other player**.

---

### **Step 8: Trust and Acceptance**

Suppose you propose:
- A0: +10 → you get 10 extra if you play A0
- A1: -10 → you pay 10 if you play A1

Then you will **never play A1** — because you’d lose 10.

So you play A0.

Then other player, seeing you will play A0, will play A0 too (since 5 > 3).

So you get 5 (base) + 10 (contract) = 15.

Other player gets 5 (base) + (they pay 10) = -5.

So the other player is **very unhappy**.

They will **not accept** such a contract.

So you need a contract that:
- Makes you want to play A0
- Makes **them want to accept** the contract

So what should they gain?

The contract specifies **only your payoff**. The other player’s cost is just that you get more when you play A0, so they have to pay.

So if you get +X for A0, they have to pay X.

If you get -Y for A1, they get Y.

So total payoff to them: base payoff + (whatever they get from you)

So:
- If they play A0: base 5, and they pay X → net = 5 - X
- If they play A1: base 3, and they get Y (because you pay them Y if you play A1) → net = 3 + Y

But since you will **never play A1**, Y is never paid.

So only X is paid (if you play A0).

So your **expected** contract payout: X, with probability 1.

So your **total** payoff: base + X = 5 + X

Other player’s payoff: base - X = 5 - X (if they play A0) or 3 + Y (if they play A1, but Y never paid)

But since you play A0 for sure, if they play A0, they get 5 - X.

They will play A0 only if 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2 (since 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2)

Wait — is that right?

Wait: they get 5 (base) if they play A0, but lose X due to the contract (because you play A0 and they pay X) → so net: 5 - X

If they play A1, they get 3 (base), and since you don’t play A1, they don’t receive Y → so net: 3

So they prefer A0 if 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2

So if X > 2, they prefer A1.

But if they play A1, you get 0 (base) + X (from contract) = X

But you are committed to playing A0, no matter what — because if you played A1 you’d lose Y.

But in your contract, if you play A1 you pay Y, so you **won’t** play A1.

So you **will** play A0.

Then if other player plays A1, your payoff is: base 0 + X = X

They get: base 3 + 0 = 3

So if X > 0, you prefer A1 for yourself? No.

Wait — the problem is that **if you commit to playing A0**, you get base 5 (with A0) + X = 5 + X

But if you were to play A1, you'd get base 0 (if they play A1) + (-Y) = -Y

So you **definitely prefer A0**.

But if you play A0, and they play A1, you get 0 base + X = X

But you get X, but base is only 0?

Wait — no:

- Your action: A0
- Their action: A1
- Base payoff: you get 0 (from matrix), they get 3

Then contract: you get X (for playing A0) → so total: 0 + X

So your payoff = X

But you would rather get 5 (if they play A0) + X = 5 + X

So if they play A1, you get only X

So if X < 5, you’d prefer them to play A0

But you cannot force them to play A0 — only your own behavior.

But you **will play A0 regardless**, because A1 costs you Y.

So you play A0.

Now, can you make it so that the other player **wants to play A0**?

They get:
- If play A0: base 5 - X (because you play A0 and they pay X)
- If play A1: base 3 (and no contract payment, since you don’t play A1)

So they prefer A0 if: 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2

So to **incentivize** them to play A0, you need X ≤ 2

Now, you also want to **maximize your own payoff**

You play A0 for sure.

So your final payoff depends on **their action**.

- If they play A0: you get base 5 + X (contract) → 5 + X
- If they play A1: you get base 0 + X → X

So your **expected** payoff (if you assume they play optimally) depends on what they prefer.

If X ≤ 2, they play A0 → you get 5 + X

If X > 2, they play A1 → you get X

So let’s compare:
- If X ≤ 2: you get 5 + X, maximized at X = 2 → you get 7
- If X > 2: you get X

So if X = 3, you get 3

But 3 < 7

So best is to set X = 2, then you get 7

And they get 5 - 2 = 3, which is equal to what they get if they play A1 (3), so they are **indifferent** — but since they are indifferent, we can assume they play A0.

So you get 5 + 2 = 7

But is there a better way?

Wait — you can also **make A1 costly** for you — i.e., set negative value for A1.

But you didn’t use that yet.

In the above, you only set A0: +2, A1: 0?

But if A1 gives 0 (no contract payment), then you get base payoff + 0.

But if you play A1, you get:
- 0 (if they play A0) → total 0
- 3 (if they play A1) → total 3

But if you are playing A0, you wouldn’t play A1 — so only the contract matters for when you play A1.

But if you set A1 to be **negative**, that makes you **hate** playing A1.

But suppose you set:
- A0: +2
- A1: -5

Then you definitely won’t play A1 — because even if you get 3 base, you lose 5 → get -2

So better to play A0 and get 5 + 2 = 7

Still, when you play A0, you get +2

But now, your previous analysis holds: if they play A0, you get 5 + 2 = 7; if they play A1, you get 0 + 2 = 2

So you want them to play A0 → only if 5 - 2 = 3 ≥ 3 → equal → they are indifferent → assume they play A0.

So payoff 7.

Can we do better?

Suppose we make **A1 give you a bonus** when you play it?

But if A1 gives you +5, you might be tempted to play it, but then if they play A0, you get 0 + 5 = 5 — but you want to avoid that because they get 0, but you get only 5.

But if they play A1, you get 3 + 5 = 8 — so **you might prefer A1**.

But then you’re not committing to A0 — so it fails to incentivize them.

So **only good if you never play A1**.

So we must ensure:
- A0 is better than A1 for you

So you need **contract value of A0 > contract value of A1** (adjusted by base payoffs)

But base payoffs differ.

Let’s define:
- If you play A0: total payoff = base_A0 + contract_A0
- If you play A

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in the response "Let’s walk through this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game**\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous move game with two players. Each chooses either A0 or A1.\n\nPayoffs (Player 1, Player 2) — note: you are **Player 2** in this setup:\n\n|           | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|\n| **You (P2): A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |\n| **You (P2): A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |\n\nSo the matrix from **your (Player 2)** perspective:\n\n- If you play A0:\n  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 5\n  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 3\n- If you play A1:\n  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 0\n  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 3\n\nNow, let’s analyze the **dominant strategies** in the base game.\n\n### **Step 2: Find Nash Equilibria of the Base Game**\n\nLet’s find best responses.\n\n#### Player 2’s best response:\n- If P1 plays A0:\n  - You get 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0\n- If P1 plays A1:\n  - You get 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent\n\nSo your best response: **A0 if P1 plays A0, and indifferent if P1 plays A1**\n\n#### Player 1’s best response:\n- If P2 plays A0:\n  - P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0\n- If P2 plays A1:\n  - P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent\n\nSo P1’s best response: **A0 if P2 plays A0, indifferent otherwise**\n\nNow, NE:\n- (A0, A0): both get 5 → each has no incentive to deviate → **Nash Equilibrium**\n- (A1, A1): both get 3. But if P1 deviates to A0 while P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 3 → no gain. P2 same. So both get 3, and neither can improve → **Another NE**\n- (A0, A1): you (P2) get 3, P1 gets 0 → P2 is happy, but P1 can switch to A0 and get 5 → not equilibrium\n- (A1, A0): you get 0, P1 gets 3 → P2 can deviate to A0 and get 5 → not equilibrium\n\nSo the **pure strategy Nash equilibria** are:\n- (A0, A0): payoff (5,5)\n- (A1, A1): payoff (3,3)\n\nThere is also a mixed strategy equilibrium. But since we’re going to introduce a **contract**, we want to **influence behavior** toward a desirable outcome.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Why Introduce a Contract?**\n\nThe key is that the contract:\n- Is an **additional** payoff rule.\n- Must be **accepted by both players** to take effect.\n- Is activated only if both accept.\n\nSo we need to **design a contract** that:\n1. Incentivizes the other player to choose actions that lead to **your preferred outcome**\n2. Is **attractive enough** to get them to accept\n3. Is **self-enforcing** in the sense that you don’t lose from playing it — otherwise you’d never accept\n\nYou want to maximize your **total expected points**, so you'll design a contract that helps achieve a better outcome than the default baseline.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Your Ideal Outcome**\n\nYou want to maximize your payoff.\n\nThe best possible outcome for you (Player 2) is **(A0, A0)**, where you get **5**.\n\nIn the NE (A0, A0), both get 5.\n\nBut (A1, A1) gives you only 3.\n\nSo your **ideal outcome is (A0, A0)**.\n\nBut can you incentivize the other player to play A0?\n\nNote: The other player will only play A0 if doing so is in *their* interest — especially when they see your contract.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: What If You Propose a Contract?**\n\nLet’s suppose you propose a contract that says:\n\n- If you (Player 2) play A0 → you **receive X** extra\n- If you play A1 → you **receive Y**\n\nBut **X and Y are signed**:\n- Positive: you receive money (from the other player)\n- Negative: you pay money (to the other player)\n\nThe **payment is drawn equally from the other player**.\n\nSo for example:\n- If you get +5 for playing A0, then the other player must pay 5 total (like minus 5) if you play A0.\n- But this is **only if the contract is accepted and active**.\n\nImportant: **The contract only applies if both players accept it.**\n\nSo you must make it **appealing** to the other player.\n\nLet’s now think strategically.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Designing a Contract That Encourages (A0, A0)**\n\nYou want **both players to choose A0**.\n\nBut currently, in the base game, P1 will play A0 only if they expect P2 to play A0.\n\nBut if P2 plays A1, P1 is indifferent (both give P1 3), so P1 will play A0 if they believe P2 plays A0.\n\nNow, **can you make P1 want to play A0 even if P2 might deviate?**\n\nLet’s suppose you **make A0 more attractive to yourself**, and **align incentives**.\n\nBut remember: if you get extra points for playing A0, then you’re more likely to play A0.\n\nIf the other player sees that you are **more likely to play A0**, they may have an incentive to play A0 too.\n\nBut here’s a better idea:\n\n### Let’s design a contract that **makes (A0, A0) the best response** for the other player.\n\nSuppose you **pay them to play A0**, and **punish them for playing A1**?\n\nWait — but you have to define how much you give/pay for **your** actions.\n\nAh! The contract is **on your own actions** — not theirs.\n\nThe contract specifies:\n- If **you** play A0 → you get +X (paid by opponent)\n- If **you** play A1 → you get +Y (paid by opponent)\n\nSo you cannot directly make them pay if they play A1.\n\nBut you can **adjust the payoff to yourself** based on your own action.\n\nSo if you make **playing A0 more valuable for you**, you are more likely to play it.\n\nIf you make **playing A1 more costly for you**, you’ll avoid it.\n\nSo strategy:\n- Make **A0 attractive** to you\n- Make **A1 costly** for you\n\nThis way, you are more likely to play A0.\n\nNow, if the other player sees that you are likely to play A0, they will want to play A0 too (because it gives them 5, vs 3 if they play A1).\n\nSo **you can shift the equilibrium**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Suppose You Commit to Playing A0**\n\nLet’s try to **induce** the other player to play A0.\n\nSuppose you want to make yourself **get a high payoff for playing A0**, so you'll always play A0.\n\nBut you must design the contract so that you **want to play A0**, and the other player **wants them to play A0 because you will**.\n\nSo:\n\nLet’s suppose you set:\n- A0: +5 (you get +5 if you play A0)\n- A1: -3 (you pay 3 if you play A1)\n\nThen your expected payoff depends on what you do.\n\nBut you’ll only play A1 if you get more than if you play A0.\n\nBut if A0 gives you +5 (extra), and A1 gives you -3 (you pay), you **won’t play A1 at all**.\n\nSo you’ll **always play A0** if the contract is accepted.\n\nNow, if you play A0, and the other player knows this, what should they do?\n\n- If they play A0 → they get 5 (base) + 0 (no extra for them) → 5\n- If they play A1 → they get 3 (base) + 0 → 3\n\nSo they will play A0.\n\nSo equilibrium becomes: both play A0 → you get 5 (base) + 5 (contract) = 10? Wait — **no**.\n\nWait: **contract only adds to your payoff**, and it’s **not shared per play**, but **total**.\n\nWait: the contract says “the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s)”.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nBut interpretation: **whenever you choose an action, the contract specifies a net transfer.**\n\nFor example:\n- If you play A0, you **get X points** from the other player (so the other player pays X to you).\n- If you play A1, you **pay Y points** to the other player (so you pay Y).\n\nSo this happens **once**, based on your action.\n\nSo final total payoff = base payoff + contract payoff.\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0 → you get base + X\n- If you play A1 → you get base - Y (if Y is positive)\n\nNow, in your contract:\n- If you play A0 → you get +X (money from other player)\n- If you play A1 → you pay Y (to other player) → so your payoff decreases\n\nSo you want to make X large and Y large.\n\nBut you must **get the other player to accept** the contract.\n\nBecause the contract only activates if **both accept**.\n\nSo you need to design a contract that is **acceptable to the other player**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Trust and Acceptance**\n\nSuppose you propose:\n- A0: +10 → you get 10 extra if you play A0\n- A1: -10 → you pay 10 if you play A1\n\nThen you will **never play A1** — because you’d lose 10.\n\nSo you play A0.\n\nThen other player, seeing you will play A0, will play A0 too (since 5 > 3).\n\nSo you get 5 (base) + 10 (contract) = 15.\n\nOther player gets 5 (base) + (they pay 10) = -5.\n\nSo the other player is **very unhappy**.\n\nThey will **not accept** such a contract.\n\nSo you need a contract that:\n- Makes you want to play A0\n- Makes **them want to accept** the contract\n\nSo what should they gain?\n\nThe contract specifies **only your payoff**. The other player’s cost is just that you get more when you play A0, so they have to pay.\n\nSo if you get +X for A0, they have to pay X.\n\nIf you get -Y for A1, they get Y.\n\nSo total payoff to them: base payoff + (whatever they get from you)\n\nSo:\n- If they play A0: base 5, and they pay X → net = 5 - X\n- If they play A1: base 3, and they get Y (because you pay them Y if you play A1) → net = 3 + Y\n\nBut since you will **never play A1**, Y is never paid.\n\nSo only X is paid (if you play A0).\n\nSo your **expected** contract payout: X, with probability 1.\n\nSo your **total** payoff: base + X = 5 + X\n\nOther player’s payoff: base - X = 5 - X (if they play A0) or 3 + Y (if they play A1, but Y never paid)\n\nBut since you play A0 for sure, if they play A0, they get 5 - X.\n\nThey will play A0 only if 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2 (since 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2)\n\nWait — is that right?\n\nWait: they get 5 (base) if they play A0, but lose X due to the contract (because you play A0 and they pay X) → so net: 5 - X\n\nIf they play A1, they get 3 (base), and since you don’t play A1, they don’t receive Y → so net: 3\n\nSo they prefer A0 if 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2\n\nSo if X > 2, they prefer A1.\n\nBut if they play A1, you get 0 (base) + X (from contract) = X\n\nBut you are committed to playing A0, no matter what — because if you played A1 you’d lose Y.\n\nBut in your contract, if you play A1 you pay Y, so you **won’t** play A1.\n\nSo you **will** play A0.\n\nThen if other player plays A1, your payoff is: base 0 + X = X\n\nThey get: base 3 + 0 = 3\n\nSo if X > 0, you prefer A1 for yourself? No.\n\nWait — the problem is that **if you commit to playing A0**, you get base 5 (with A0) + X = 5 + X\n\nBut if you were to play A1, you'd get base 0 (if they play A1) + (-Y) = -Y\n\nSo you **definitely prefer A0**.\n\nBut if you play A0, and they play A1, you get 0 base + X = X\n\nBut you get X, but base is only 0?\n\nWait — no:\n\n- Your action: A0\n- Their action: A1\n- Base payoff: you get 0 (from matrix), they get 3\n\nThen contract: you get X (for playing A0) → so total: 0 + X\n\nSo your payoff = X\n\nBut you would rather get 5 (if they play A0) + X = 5 + X\n\nSo if they play A1, you get only X\n\nSo if X < 5, you’d prefer them to play A0\n\nBut you cannot force them to play A0 — only your own behavior.\n\nBut you **will play A0 regardless**, because A1 costs you Y.\n\nSo you play A0.\n\nNow, can you make it so that the other player **wants to play A0**?\n\nThey get:\n- If play A0: base 5 - X (because you play A0 and they pay X)\n- If play A1: base 3 (and no contract payment, since you don’t play A1)\n\nSo they prefer A0 if: 5 - X ≥ 3 → X ≤ 2\n\nSo to **incentivize** them to play A0, you need X ≤ 2\n\nNow, you also want to **maximize your own payoff**\n\nYou play A0 for sure.\n\nSo your final payoff depends on **their action**.\n\n- If they play A0: you get base 5 + X (contract) → 5 + X\n- If they play A1: you get base 0 + X → X\n\nSo your **expected** payoff (if you assume they play optimally) depends on what they prefer.\n\nIf X ≤ 2, they play A0 → you get 5 + X\n\nIf X > 2, they play A1 → you get X\n\nSo let’s compare:\n- If X ≤ 2: you get 5 + X, maximized at X = 2 → you get 7\n- If X > 2: you get X\n\nSo if X = 3, you get 3\n\nBut 3 < 7\n\nSo best is to set X = 2, then you get 7\n\nAnd they get 5 - 2 = 3, which is equal to what they get if they play A1 (3), so they are **indifferent** — but since they are indifferent, we can assume they play A0.\n\nSo you get 5 + 2 = 7\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nWait — you can also **make A1 costly** for you — i.e., set negative value for A1.\n\nBut you didn’t use that yet.\n\nIn the above, you only set A0: +2, A1: 0?\n\nBut if A1 gives 0 (no contract payment), then you get base payoff + 0.\n\nBut if you play A1, you get:\n- 0 (if they play A0) → total 0\n- 3 (if they play A1) → total 3\n\nBut if you are playing A0, you wouldn’t play A1 — so only the contract matters for when you play A1.\n\nBut if you set A1 to be **negative**, that makes you **hate** playing A1.\n\nBut suppose you set:\n- A0: +2\n- A1: -5\n\nThen you definitely won’t play A1 — because even if you get 3 base, you lose 5 → get -2\n\nSo better to play A0 and get 5 + 2 = 7\n\nStill, when you play A0, you get +2\n\nBut now, your previous analysis holds: if they play A0, you get 5 + 2 = 7; if they play A1, you get 0 + 2 = 2\n\nSo you want them to play A0 → only if 5 - 2 = 3 ≥ 3 → equal → they are indifferent → assume they play A0.\n\nSo payoff 7.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nSuppose we make **A1 give you a bonus** when you play it?\n\nBut if A1 gives you +5, you might be tempted to play it, but then if they play A0, you get 0 + 5 = 5 — but you want to avoid that because they get 0, but you get only 5.\n\nBut if they play A1, you get 3 + 5 = 8 — so **you might prefer A1**.\n\nBut then you’re not committing to A0 — so it fails to incentivize them.\n\nSo **only good if you never play A1**.\n\nSo we must ensure:\n- A0 is better than A1 for you\n\nSo you need **contract value of A0 > contract value of A1** (adjusted by base payoffs)\n\nBut base payoffs differ.\n\nLet’s define:\n- If you play A0: total payoff = base_A0 + contract_A0\n- If you play A"

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
To make an informed decision on the approval of the proposed contracts, let's evaluate the impact of each contract on the payoffs for both players. Understanding how the contracts modify payoffs will help determine which contract(s) are beneficial or detrimental to us (Player 2).

### Initial Payoff Matrix Without Contracts

First, review the baseline payoffs (no contract):
- If Player 2 chooses A0:
    - Opponent chooses A0: Player 2 gets 5 points.
    - Opponent chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1:
    - Opponent chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 points.
    - Opponent chooses A1: Player 2 gets 3 points.

### Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1
- A0: +4 points, drawn equally from the other player.
    - New Payoff Matrix:
        - Player 2 chooses A0:
            - Opponent chooses A0: Player 2 gets 5 + 4 = 9 points.
            - Opponent chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 + 4 = 4 points.
        - Player 2 chooses A1:
            - Opponent chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 points.
            - Opponent chooses A1: Player 2 gets 3 points.
    - Analysis: This significantly increases the payoff for playing A0 for Player 2. However, since the payment is drawn from the other player, it might not be as attractive to the opponent.
   
### Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2
- A0: +1 point, drawn equally from the other player.
- A1: -2 points, distributed equally among the other players.
    - New Payoff Matrix:
        - Player 2 chooses A0:
            - Opponent chooses A0: Player 2 gets 5 + 1 = 6 points.
            - Opponent chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 + 1 = 1 point.
        - Player 2 chooses A1:
            - Opponent chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 - 2 = 1 point.
            - Opponent chooses A1: Player 2 gets 3 - 2 = 1 point.
    - Analysis: This modifies the incentives so that A0 becomes more attractive and A1 less attractive to Player 2. It reduces the attractiveness of playing A1 for both players.

### Decision
To maximize our points, we should prefer contracts that boost our payoffs without significantly reducing our opponent's payoffs, to ensure they will also consider the contracts attractive enough to approve.

1. **Contract C1**
    - Impact on Player 2: Significant increase in payoff if choosing A0.
    - Impact on Player 1: They lose 4 points whenever Player 2 chooses A0, which significantly reduces their incentive to approve.

2. **Contract C2**
    - Impact on Player 2: Slight increase in payoff when choosing A0 and a reduction in payoff when choosing A1.
    - Impact on Player 1: Reduced payoff when choosing A1 but not as extreme as C1.

Considering our desire to maximize points and likely get the contract approved, **C2** is more balanced and attractive for both parties. Hence, we only approve C2.

### Final Decision

```json
{
    "C1": false,
    "C2": true
}
```

This results in the JSON object indicating our approval choice for each proposed contract.

response:
Under either proposed contract, choosing **A0** gives you **+4** paid by the other player (since there are only two players), and if the **other player** chooses **A0** you pay **4** to them.

So (from Player 2’s perspective) the net payoff changes are:

- **(A0, A0):** base \(5\) and the transfers cancel (+4 −4) ⇒ still **5**
- **(A0, A1):** base \(0\) +4 ⇒ **4**
- **(A1, A0):** base \(3\) −4 ⇒ **−1**
- **(A1, A1):** base \(3\) ⇒ **3**

Now compare your incentives:

- If Player 1 plays **A0**: you prefer **A0** (5) over **A1** (−1)
- If Player 1 plays **A1**: you prefer **A0** (4) over **A1** (3)

So with the contract, **A0 becomes strictly dominant** for you (and symmetrically for Player 1), making the outcome **(A0, A0)** robust and yielding **5 points each**, avoiding the risk of ending up at the lower-payoff (A1, A1) outcome.

Both proposed contracts are identical, so approving both only helps ensure a contract like this is selected.

Both proposed contracts are identical: choosing **A0** gives you **+4** paid by the other player; choosing **A1** gives no transfer.

Under this contract, your payoffs become:
- (A0,A0): you get \(5 +4 -4 = 5\)
- (A0,A1): you get \(0 +4 = 4\)
- (A1,A0): you get \(3 -4 = -1\)
- (A1,A1): you get \(3\)

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you (it’s better no matter what the other player does), and symmetrically for the other player too. That makes (A0,A0) the clear outcome, giving you **5 points**, which is at least as good as the best equilibrium you might otherwise end up in.

Since C1 and C2 are the same and beneficial, I approve both.

response:
The original game presents two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) with a payoff of (5, 5) and (A1, A1) with a payoff of (3, 3). In the original game, choosing A1 is a "safe" strategy as it guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's move. Choosing A0 is riskier, as it yields 5 points if the opponent also plays A0, but 0 points if the opponent plays A1.

The proposed contracts (C1 and C2 are identical) aim to change the payoff structure by rewarding players for choosing A0.
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- This results in a new payoff matrix:
  - (A0, A0): both receive 5 points (5 + 4 - 4 = 5).
  - (A0, A1): Player 1 receives 4 points (0 + 4), Player 2 receives -1 point (3 - 4).
  - (A1, A0): Player 1 receives -1 point (3 - 4), Player 2 receives 4 points (0 + 4).
  - (A1, A1): both receive 3 points (no changes).

Under this contract, A0 becomes a strictly dominant strategy for both players. If the other player chooses A0, you get 5 points with A0 versus -1 with A1. If the other player chooses A1, you get 4 points with A0 versus 3 with A1. Since A0 is now the dominant strategy, both rational players will choose it, leading to a stable and guaranteed outcome of 5 points each. This is superior to the baseline game where players might settle for the lower-payoff equilibrium (3, 3) to avoid the risk of getting 0 points.

Since both C1 and C2 create this beneficial incentive structure, approving both maximizes the chance that such a contract is implemented.

To maximize your points in this game, let's first analyze the original payoff matrix and then the impact of the proposed contracts.

### Original Game Analysis
The original payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) providing 5 points and (A1, A1) providing 3 points. While (A0, A0) is the best outcome for both players, there is a risk: if you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you receive 0 points. This risk might lead players to choose A1 to guarantee at least 3 points.

### Contract Analysis
The contracts involve transferring points if a player chooses action A0.

**Contract C1 (4 points for A0):**
- If both choose A0: (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = (5, 5)
- If P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1: (0+4, 3-4) = (4, -1)
- If P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0: (3-4, 0+4) = (-1, 4)
- If both choose A1: (3, 3)
In C1, A0 is a dominant strategy for both players (P1: 5 > -1 and 4 > 3). This guarantees an outcome of (5, 5).

**Contract C2 (5 points for A0):**
- If both choose A0: (5+5-5, 5+5-5) = (5, 5)
- If P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1: (0+5, 3-5) = (5, -2)
- If P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0: (3-5, 0+5) = (-2, 5)
- If both choose A1: (3, 3)
In C2, A0 is also a dominant strategy for both players (P1: 5 > -2 and 5 > 3). This also guarantees an outcome of (5, 5).

### Decision Reasoning
Both contracts C1 and C2 transform the game so that A0 becomes the dominant strategy, removing the risk of receiving 0 points and stabilizing the highest-payoff Nash equilibrium (5, 5). 

- **C1** ensures that if you play A0, you get at least 4 points regardless of what the other player does.
- **C2** ensures that if you play A0, you get at least 5 points regardless of what the other player does.

Since both contracts effectively lead to the maximum possible payoff (5 points) while eliminating the risks present in the base game, it is beneficial to approve both. C2 is slightly better for you (Player 1) in the event that Player 2 deviates from the dominant strategy, but both are Pareto improvements over the possibility of falling into the (A1, A1) equilibrium.

response:
To determine whether to approve the proposed contracts, we first analyze the payoff matrix of the original game and how each contract modifies it.

### 1. Original Game Payoff Matrix
The points are awarded as follows (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This is a coordination game (specifically a Stag Hunt). There are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). Although (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant (5 points vs 3 points), (A1, A1) is risk-dominant because playing A1 ensures 3 points regardless of the other player's move, whereas playing A0 is risky if the other player switches to A1.

### 2. Analysis of Contract 1 (C1)
C1: A player choosing A0 receives +4 from the other player.
- (A0, A0): (5 + 4 - 4, 5 + 4 - 4) = (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 4 - 0, 3 + 0 - 4) = (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (3 + 0 - 4, 0 + 4 - 0) = (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In C1, A0 becomes a **dominant strategy** for both players.
- For P2: If P1 plays A0, A0 (5) > A1 (-1). If P1 plays A1, A0 (4) > A1 (3).
Since A0 is dominant, both players will choose A0, resulting in the maximum possible payoff of 5 points each.

### 3. Analysis of Contract 2 (C2)
C2: A player choosing A0 receives +1 from the other player.
- (A0, A0): (5 + 1 - 1, 5 + 1 - 1) = (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 1 - 0, 3 + 0 - 1) = (1, 2)
- (A1, A0): (3 + 0 - 1, 0 + 1 - 0) = (2, 1)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In C2, (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) remain Nash equilibria. However, (A0, A0) becomes **risk-dominant**.
- P2's average payoff for A0: (5 + 1) / 2 = 3.0
- P2's average payoff for A1: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
By making A0 the safer choice, C2 increases the likelihood of both players coordinating on (A0, A0).

### Conclusion
Both C1 and C2 incentivize the payoff-dominant outcome (A0, A0), which yields the highest score for you (Player 2). C1 is even stronger than C2 because it makes A0 a dominant strategy. Since your goal is to maximize your points, both contracts are beneficial compared to the original game.

response:
To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the game and the proposed contracts step by step.

### 1. Basic Game Analysis
The base game has two Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0):** (5, 5) point distribution.
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3) point distribution.

While (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant (offering the most points), (A1, A1) is risk-dominant in the base game. To prefer A0, a player must believe there is at least a 60% chance the other player will also choose A0. If coordination fails, playing A0 against A1 results in 0 points.

### 2. Contract Analysis
A contract modifies the payoffs by transferring points between players based on their actions.

**Contract 1 (C1):** A0 receives +4 from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** (0+4-0, 3+0-4) = (4, -1)
- **(A1, A0):** (3+0-4, 0+4-0) = (-1, 4)
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)
Under C1, action A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players (5 > -1 and 4 > 3). This effectively guarantees that both rational players will choose A0, leading to a payout of 5 points.

**Contract 2 (C2):** A0 receives +1 from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** (5+1-1, 5+1-1) = (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** (0+1-0, 3+0-1) = (1, 2)
- **(A1, A0):** (3+0-1, 0+1-0) = (2, 1)
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)
Under C2, both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) remain Nash equilibria. However, A0 becomes risk-dominant (the required probability for the other player to choose A0 to make A0 the better choice drops from 60% to 40%).

### 3. Decision Strategy
- **C1** is the most favorable because it makes coordination on the highest payoff (5 points) a certainty by creating a dominant strategy.
- **C2** is also better than the base game as it lowers the risk threshold for coordination, but it is less effective than C1.

As Player 1, I proposed C1. To ensure C1 has the best chance of winning the approval vote (as it specifies the random selection from contracts with the maximum number of approvals), I should approve C1. Since C2 also encourages the (A0, A0) outcome and is better than the base game, it is safe to approve as well, but C1 is the strictly superior coordination mechanism. Given the goal is to maximize points, and C1 guarantees 5 points, approving both increases the chance that *some* contract passes, which is better than no contract. However, if Player 2 only approves C2, approving both would lead to C2 winning. Strategically, since both contracts lead to the same (5, 5) equilibrium but C1 is more robust, approving both is a safe way to ensure the group moves away from the less efficient (A1, A1) equilibrium.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the game with and without it.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The original payoff matrix is as follows:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this scenario, there are two Nash Equilibria:
- **(A0, A0):** Both receive 5 points.
- **(A1, A1):** Both receive 3 points.

While (A0, A0) is Pareto dominant (better for both), it is risky. If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 receives 0 points. If Player 1 chooses A1, they are guaranteed at least 3 points regardless of Player 2's decision. This is a classic "Stag Hunt" coordination game.

### 2. Analysis of the Game with the Contract
The contract adds a payment of 4 points to anyone who chooses A0, taken from the other player.
Let's recalculate the payoffs:
- **(A0, A0):** 
    - Player 1: $5 + 4 (\text{for playing A0}) - 4 (\text{taken for P2 playing A0}) = 5$
    - Player 2: $5 + 4 (\text{for playing A0}) - 4 (\text{taken for P1 playing A0}) = 5$
- **(A0, A1):** 
    - Player 1: $0 + 4 - 0 = 4$
    - Player 2: $3 + 0 - 4 = -1$
- **(A1, A0):** 
    - Player 1: $3 + 0 - 4 = -1$
    - Player 2: $0 + 4 - 0 = 4$
- **(A1, A1):** 
    - Player 1: $3$
    - Player 2: $3$

With the contract active, **A0 becomes a dominant strategy** for both players:
- If P2 chooses A0, P1 gets 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1.
- If P2 chooses A1, P1 gets 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1.

Since A0 is now the dominant strategy for both players, the only Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), resulting in 5 points for each player.

### 3. Decision
Signing the contract changes the game from a risky coordination game into a game with a single dominant-strategy equilibrium (A0, A0). Since the contract was proposed by Player 1 and it guarantees the highest possible payoff (5 points) while removing the risk of receiving 0 points, it is highly beneficial to sign.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:

To maximize your points, first analyze the original game and how the proposed contracts change it.

**Original Game Analysis:**
The payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

There are two Nash equilibria in this game: (A0, A0), which yields 5 points each, and (A1, A1), which yields 3 points each. While (A0, A0) is better for both, there is a risk of players ending up at (A1, A1) if they are risk-averse or anticipate the other player choosing A1.

**Contract C1 Analysis (Proposed by Player 1):**
Player choosing A0 receives 4 points from the other player.
- (A0, A0): (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0+4, 3-4) = (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (3-4, 0+4) = (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)
In C1, playing A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for both players (5 > -1 and 4 > 3). This guarantees that both players will choose A0, resulting in a payoff of 5 for you.

**Contract C2 Analysis (Proposed by Player 2):**
Player choosing A1 pays 1 point to the other player.
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0+1, 3-1) = (1, 2)
- (A1, A0): (3-1, 0+1) = (2, 1)
- (A1, A1): (3-1+1, 3-1+1) = (3, 3)
In C2, both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) remain Nash equilibria. While better than the original game (since the penalty for picking the "wrong" action is reduced), it does not guarantee the 5-point outcome.

**Decision Strategy:**
Your objective is to maximize your total points. Contract C1 is the most beneficial because it converts the game into one where the best outcome (5 points) is the unique Nash equilibrium via dominant strategies. Contract C2 is less effective than C1 because it leaves the inferior (3, 3) equilibrium intact.

According to the rules, the winning contract is selected from those with the most approvals. To maximize the chance of C1 being selected, you should approve C1 and not approve C2. Approving C2 would only increase the likelihood of C2 being selected over C1 if both receive the same or more votes.

- Approval of C1: true
- Approval of C2: false

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Analyze the original game:** The payoff matrix for (Player 1, Player 2) is:
    *   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
    *   (A0, A1): (0, 3)
    *   (A1, A0): (3, 0)
    *   (A1, A1): (3, 3)
    Both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash equilibria. However, (A1, A1) is risk-dominant: if a player is unsure of the other's action (assigning a 50/50 probability), A1 yields 3 points while A0 yields 2.5 points.

2.  **Evaluate Contract 1 (C1):** If a player picks A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
    *   (A0, A0): Payoffs remain (5, 5) because the 4-point payments cancel out.
    *   (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0 + 4 = 4; Player 2 gets 3 - 4 = -1.
    *   (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3 - 4 = -1; Player 2 gets 0 + 4 = 4.
    *   (A1, A1): (3, 3).
    Under C1, A0 is a dominant strategy for both players (4 > 3 and 5 > -1). The game will result in (A0, A0) with 5 points for each player.

3.  **Evaluate Contract 2 (C2):** If a player picks A0, they receive 2 points from the other player.
    *   (A0, A0): (5, 5).
    *   (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0 + 2 = 2; Player 2 gets 3 - 2 = 1.
    *   (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3 - 2 = 1; Player 2 gets 0 + 2 = 2.
    *   (A1, A1): (3, 3).
    Under C2, A0 is no longer a dominant strategy (if the other player plays A1, A1 is the best response as 3 > 2). However, A0 is now risk-dominant over A1 (average 3.5 for A0 vs 2 for A1 if the other player is 50/50).

4.  **Strategic Decisions:** 
    *   C1 is the superior contract for Player 1 because it guarantees the higher payoff (5 points) by making A0 the dominant strategy. Even if the other player chooses A1, Player 1 still receives 4 points.
    *   C2 is also better than no contract, but it is less robust than C1 because (A1, A1) remains a potential Nash equilibrium.
    *   To maximize the probability of C1 being the selected contract, Player 1 should approve C1 and not approve C2. Approving both would increase the likelihood of C2 winning if Player 2 also approves C2, whereas approving only C1 ensures a contract is chosen (since at least one approval exists) and biases the selection toward the more favorable C1.

First incorporate the contract into your net payoff:

- If you play **A0**, you **receive +4** from the other player.
- If the other player plays **A0**, you **pay -4** to them.
- If anyone plays **A1**, no contract transfer happens for that player.

So your adjusted payoff matrix (Player 2) becomes:

- (You A0, Other A0): \(5 + 4 - 4 = 5\)
- (You A0, Other A1): \(0 + 4 = 4\)
- (You A1, Other A0): \(3 - 4 = -1\)
- (You A1, Other A1): \(3\)

Now compare A0 vs A1 given the other player plays A0 with probability \(p\):

- \(EU(A0) = 5p + 4(1-p) = 4 + p\)  (ranges from 4 to 5)
- \(EU(A1) = (-1)p + 3(1-p) = 3 - 4p\) (ranges from 3 down to -1)

For every \(p \in [0,1]\), \(EU(A0) > EU(A1)\). So **A0 strictly dominates A1**, meaning the best strategy is to put all probability on A0.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
To maximize my point total, I need to compare the original game matrix with the modifications proposed by each contract.

**1. Original Game Matrix:**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)
*Nash Equilibria:* (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) is the best outcome, (A1, A1) is a stable equilibrium that players might settle for to avoid the 0-point payoff.

**2. Contract C1 (P1 proposal):**
- A0 provides a +4 point transfer from the other player.
- (A0, A0): 5 + 4 - 4 = 5, 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
- (A0, A1): 0 + 4 = 4, 3 - 4 = -1
- (A1, A0): 3 - 4 = -1, 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1, A1): 3, 3
*Analysis:* For Player 1, A0 is now a strictly dominant strategy (5 > -1 and 4 > 3). The same applies to Player 2. This matrix results in a single, stable Nash equilibrium at (A0, A0), guaranteeing 5 points.

**3. Contract C2 (P2 proposal):**
- A0 gives a +1 transfer; A1 involves a -2 transfer.
- (A0, A0): 5 + 1 - 1 = 5, 5 + 1 - 1 = 5
- (A0, A1): 0 + 1 + 2 = 3, 3 - 1 - 2 = 0
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 - 1 = 0, 0 + 2 + 1 = 3
- (A1, A1): 3 - 2 + 2 = 3, 3 - 2 + 2 = 3
*Analysis:* For Player 1, A0 is weakly dominant (5 > 0 and 3 ≥ 3). While (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium, (A1, A1) remains a Nash equilibrium as neither player has a strict incentive to switch. This is less effective than C1 at ensuring the (5, 5) outcome.

**Conclusion:**
Contract C1 is superior because it makes A0 a strictly dominant strategy, virtually guaranteeing the maximum payout of 5 points. Contract C2 is also beneficial compared to the original game as it nudges players toward A0, but since the selection process favors contracts with the most approvals, I should only approve the best possible option to ensure it has the highest chance of winning. Approving my own proposal C1 is the optimal choice.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To decide whether to sign the payment contract, we need to analyze how the additional payments affect the payoff structure of the game. Let's first break down the payoff matrix with and without the contract.

### Original Payoff Matrix
Without the contract, the payoffs for each action combination are as follows:
- **(A0, A0)**: You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- **(A0, A1)**: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- **(A1, A0)**: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- **(A1, A1)**: You get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

### Payoff Matrix with Contract
With the contract in place, additional points are added or subtracted as follows:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 4 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

So, the adjusted payoffs for each action combination are:
- **(A0, A0)**: 
  - You get 5 (original) + 4 (A0 bonus) - 4 (payment to other player) = 5 points.
  - Other player gets 5 (original) + 4 (A0 bonus) - 4 (payment to you) = 5 points.
- **(A0, A1)**:
  - You get 0 (original) + 4 (A0 bonus) - 0 (no A1 bonus) = 4 points.
  - Other player gets 3 (original) - 4 (payment to you) = -1 points.
- **(A1, A0)**:
  - You get 3 (original) - 4 (payment to other player) = -1 points.
  - Other player gets 0 (original) + 4 (A0 bonus) = 4 points.
- **(A1, A1)**:
  - You get 3 (original) = 3 points.
  - Other player gets 3 (original) = 3 points.

### Expected Outcome
We need to consider the incentives created by the contract:
1. **In (A0, A0)**, both players end up with the same payoff as without the contract.
2. **In (A0, A1)**, you are better off (+4 vs 0), but the other player is worse off (-1 vs 3).
3. **In (A1, A0)**, you are worse off (-1 vs 3), but the other player is better off (4 vs 0).
4. **In (A1, A1)**, both end up the same as without the contract at 3 points.

### Strategic Implications
If both players are rational and aiming to maximize their respective points:
- The contract incentivizes both players to prefer action A0 since the payment from the other player would compensate any original differences, making mutual cooperation the attractive strategy.

However, the equilibrium without the added contract doesn't change because the payments balance out symmetrically for mutual (A0, A0) and payoffs can't force a cooperative equilibrium higher than the original one.

### Decision
The contract ensures that you do not lose from mutual cooperation and depend on the original risk profile of yielding A1 to provoke a lower expected outcome:

Given this analysis:

1. Signing the contract incentivizes fairness and balance in your expected outcomes (5 points if mutual cooperation rates hold).
2. Without the contract, the A1 move without contract holds the risk of lower outcome if opponent aligns similarly.

Therefore, signing could strategically prevent worst-case losses.

Here's my final decision in the required JSON format:

- You choose A1, They choose A0: You get 3, They get 0
- If both choose A1: You get 3, They get 3

In the initial setup:
- If both choose A0, total payoff: 10 (5 + 5)
- If both choose A1, total payoff: 6 (3 + 3)

### Contract proposed by Player 1 (C1):
- A0 gets additional 4 points, drawn equally from the other player.
  - If both choose A0: You get 9 (5 + 4 incoming - 0 outgoing), They get 9
  - You choose A0, They choose A1: You get 2 (0 + 4 incoming - 2 outgoing), They get 1 (3 - 2 + 0)
  - You choose A1, They choose A0: You get 1 (3 - 2 incoming), They get 7 (0 + 4 - 1 outgoing)
  - If both choose A1: 3 points each (no change from initial)
  
### Contract proposed by Player 2 (C2):
- A0: receive 1 point, drawn equally from the other player.
- A1: pay 2 points, distributed equally among players.
  - If both choose A0: You get 6 (5 + 1 - 0.5), They get 6 (5 + 1 - 0.5)
  - You choose A0, They choose A1: You get 0.5 (0 + 1 - 0.5), They get 1.5 (3 - 1 + 0.5)
  - You choose A1, They choose A0: You get 4.5 (3 - 1 + 0.5), They get 0.5 (0 + 1 - 0.5)
  - If both choose A1: You get 2 (3 - 1), They get 2 (3 - 1)

### Comparison and Decision
Comparing the expected payoffs of each possible outcome:

#### For contract C1:
- Both A0: (9, 9) 
- A0 against A1: (2, 1) 
- A1 against A0: (1, 7)
- Both A1: same as baseline (3, 3) 

#### For contract C2:
- Both A0: (6, 6)
- A0 against A1: (0.5, 1.5)
- A1 against A0: (4.5, 0.5)
- Both A1: (2, 2)

It's clear that:
- **Contract C1**: Skews payoff significantly toward achieving mutual cooperation (both playing A0). However, it incentivizes the other player to choose A1 if I stick with A0.
- **Contract C2**: Provides a less drastic change but makes A1 less attractive.

Overall, approving **Contract C1** seems detrimental where cooperation isn't a trend. **Contract C2** balances gains marginally for cooperation while deterring A1 a bit more.

### Final Analysis:
Given the balance and expected gains, I prefer **C2** over **C1** but will maintain both being detailedly evaluated.

Final approval JSON object:
```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the game's payoffs both with and without the contract.

### Original Game (No Contract)
The payoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) are:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this scenario, there are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) is Pareto optimal (best for both), A1 is a "safer" choice for a risk-averse player because the minimum payoff for A1 is 3, whereas the minimum for A0 is 0.

### Contract Game (If Signed)
The contract specifies that if a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** Both receive 5. Player 1 gets +4 (from P2) and -4 (to P2), resulting in 5. Player 2 also results in 5.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 (0 + 4 = 4). Player 2 chooses A1 (3 - 4 = -1). Payoff: (4, -1).
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1 (3 - 4 = -1). Player 2 chooses A0 (0 + 4 = 4). Payoff: (-1, 4).
- **(A1, A1):** Both choose A1. No payments. Payoff: (3, 3).

### Decision Analysis
With the contract:
1. If the other player plays A0, your payoffs are 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1). You prefer A0.
2. If the other player plays A1, your payoffs are 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1). You prefer A0.

The contract transforms A0 into a **dominant strategy** for both players. In game theory, a dominant strategy equilibrium is much more stable and predictable than a game with multiple Nash equilibria. By making A0 the dominant strategy, the contract virtually guarantees that both players will choose A0, leading to the maximum possible total points (5 each). 

Signing the contract eliminates the risk of ending up in the (A1, A1) equilibrium (3 points) or the risk of being "left behind" in an (A0, A1) or (A1, A0) scenario (0 points in the original game). Because the contract ensures (A0, A0) is the rational outcome for both parties, signing it is the optimal choice for a player looking to maximize their points.

To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and then update it based on the additional payment contract.

### Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
*   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 3)
*   (A1, A0): (3, 0)
*   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### The Contract:
*   If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 4 points, taken from the other player's score.
*   If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

### Updated Payoff Matrix (with Contract):
1.  **(A0, A0)**:
    *   Player 1 receives 4 points from Player 2 (for P1 choosing A0).
    *   Player 2 receives 4 points from Player 1 (for P2 choosing A0).
    *   P1 Final: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**
    *   P2 Final: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**
2.  **(A0, A1)**:
    *   Player 1 receives 4 points from Player 2 (for P1 choosing A0).
    *   Player 2 receives nothing (choosing A1).
    *   P1 Final: 0 + 4 = **4**
    *   P2 Final: 3 - 4 = **-1**
3.  **(A1, A0)**:
    *   Player 1 receives nothing (choosing A1).
    *   Player 2 receives 4 points from Player 1 (for P2 choosing A0).
    *   P1 Final: 3 - 4 = **-1**
    *   P2 Final: 0 + 4 = **4**
4.  **(A1, A1)**:
    *   No additional payments.
    *   P1 Final: **3**
    *   P2 Final: **3**

### Strategic Analysis:
Looking at things from Player 1’s perspective (the same logic applies to Player 2):
*   If Player 2 chooses **A0**, Player 1 gets **5** by choosing A0 and **-1** by choosing A1.
*   If Player 2 chooses **A1**, Player 1 gets **4** by choosing A0 and **3** by choosing A1.

In both possible scenarios, choosing **A0** results in a higher payoff than choosing A1. Therefore, A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy**. Furthermore, the Nash equilibrium of (A0, A0) provides the highest mutual payoff (5 each) and the highest total points (10).

Given that A0 is the dominant strategy for maximizing points, the rational choice is to allocate 100% probability to A0.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

As Player 2, my payoff matrix is:
```
              P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0         5, 5      0, 3
P2: A1         3, 0      3, 3
```

The base game has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5) - the best outcome
- (A1, A1) with payoffs (3, 3) - a worse outcome

The problem is coordination risk - we might end up at the worse equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (Proposed by Player 1)

Contract 1: Players choosing A0 receive +4 from the other player.

Modified payoffs:
```
              P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0         5, 5      4, -1
P2: A1        -1, 4      3, 3
```

Analysis:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 5 from A0, -1 from A1 → I prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: I get 4 from A0, 3 from A1 → I prefer A0

**A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players!** This guarantees the (A0, A0) equilibrium with payoffs (5, 5).

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (Proposed by Player 2)

Contract 2: Players choosing A1 pay -1 to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
```
              P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0         5, 5      1, 2
P2: A1         2, 1      3, 3
```

Analysis:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 5 from A0, 2 from A1 → I prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: I get 1 from A0, 3 from A1 → I prefer A1

Both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) remain Nash equilibria. **The coordination problem is not solved.**

## Step 4: Decision

From Player 2's perspective:
- **Contract 1**: Highly beneficial - eliminates coordination risk and guarantees the best outcome (5, 5)
- **Contract 2**: No improvement - still has multiple equilibria and coordination risk

I should approve Contract 1 because it guarantees the optimal outcome. I should not approve Contract 2 because it doesn't improve the situation meaningfully.

response:
To tackle this decision-making game, let's break things down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Basic Payoffs
First, let’s consider the payoffs without the contract.

1. If both players choose A0:
   - Player 2 receives 5 points.
   - Player 1 receives 5 points.

2. If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:
   - Player 2 receives 0 points.
   - Player 1 receives 3 points.

3. If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:
   - Player 2 receives 3 points.
   - Player 1 receives 0 points.

4. If both players choose A1:
   - Player 2 receives 3 points.
   - Player 1 receives 3 points.

### Step 2: Incorporate Contract into Payoffs
With the contract in place:

1. If Player 2 chooses A0:
   - Player 1 receives an additional 4 points.
   - Player 2 loses 4 points.

2. If Player 2 chooses A1:
   - No additional payments.

Now let's compute the new payoffs considering the contract:

1. If both players choose A0:
   - Player 2: 5 - 4 = 1 point.
   - Player 1: 5 + 4 = 9 points.

2. If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:
   - Player 2: 0 - 4 = -4 points.
   - Player 1: 3 + 4 = 7 points.

3. If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:
   - Player 2: 3 points.
   - Player 1: 0 points.

4. If both players choose A1:
   - Player 2: 3 points.
   - Player 1: 3 points.

### Step 3: Consider Player 1’s Strategy
Given the structure, Player 1 would want to maximize points, likely leading them to choose action A0 frequently, especially since choosing A0 has an additional 4 points benefit regardless of my action.

### Step 4: Determine Optimal Strategy for Player 2
Since Player 1's likely frequent choice is A0, Player 2 should compare the expected payoffs:

- If Player 2 frequently chooses A1:
  - Expected payoffs are: 3 points if Player 1 chooses A0 or 3 points if Player 1 chooses A1.

- If Player 2 frequently chooses A0:
  - Expected payoffs are: 1 point if Player 1 chooses A0 or -4 points if Player 1 chooses A1.
  - The risk of substantial point loss is high with A0 given Player 1’s potential mix with A0 and A1 choices.

### Conclusion and Probability Distribution
Given the valuation of payoffs and the need to avoid negative payoffs, a strategy heavily favoring A1 for Player 2 seems optimal. Player 2 gains consistently more stable returns with A1, avoiding significant losses due to the contract.

### Final Answer
Given consistent examination of payoff and risk, the optimal probability distribution over actions should be:

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 100}
```

response:
The objective is to maximize the points received in a two-player decision-making game. We need to analyze whether signing the proposed contract is strategically beneficial.

### Step 1: Analyze the Base Game
The payoff matrix for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Equilibria:**
- There are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5) and (A1, A1) with payoffs (3, 3).
- (A0, A0) is the payoff-dominant equilibrium (highest reward for both).
- (A1, A1) is the risk-dominant equilibrium because playing A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's action, whereas choosing A0 risks receiving 0 points.

### Step 2: Analyze the Contract
The contract specifies:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 1 point from the other player.
- if a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

**New Payoff Matrix (with Contract):**
- **(A0, A0):** P1 gets $5 + 1 - 1 = 5$, P2 gets $5 + 1 - 1 = 5$.
- **(A0, A1):** P1 gets $0 + 1 = 1$, P2 gets $3 - 1 = 2$.
- **(A1, A0):** P1 gets $3 - 1 = 2$, P2 gets $0 + 1 = 1$.
- **(A1, A1):** P1 gets 3, P2 gets 3.

### Step 3: Compare Strategic Situations
- **Risk Mitigation:** In the base game, if I choose A0, the worst-case scenario is 0. With the contract, the worst-case scenario for choosing A0 is 1. Conversely, in the base game, choosing A1 guarantees 3. With the contract, A1 no longer guarantees 3; if the other player chooses A0, my payoff for A1 drops to 2.
- **Coordination Threshold:** 
    - In the base game, P2 chooses A0 if they believe P1 will choose A0 with a probability $p > 0.6$.
    - In the contract game, P2 chooses A0 if $5p + 1(1-p) > 2p + 3(1-p)$, which simplifies to $5p > 2$, or $p > 0.4$.
- The contract lowers the threshold of trust required to target the (5, 5) equilibrium.

### Step 4: Player's Position and Proposition
I am Player 2. The prompt notes that this specific contract was **proposed by Player 2**. Since the contract was designed by my position to facilitate coordination on the higher payout (5, 5) and reduces the risk of choosing A0, it is in my best interest to sign it.

### Step 5: Final Conclusion
Signing the contract makes the optimal payoff (5, 5) more likely and safer to pursue than in the base game. It transforms a game with a high-risk coordination hurdle into one where the incentive to cooperate is much stronger.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we first analyze the original game and how the contract modifies its payoffs.

### Original Game (Player 2's perspective)
The payoffs for (Player 2, Player 1) are:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In the original game, if you choose A1, you are guaranteed 3 points regardless of what the other player does. If you choose A0, you could get 5 points (if the other player also chooses A0) or 0 points (if the other player chooses A1). This constitutes a "Stag Hunt" style coordination game where (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash equilibria, but (A1, A1) is the "risk-dominant" equilibrium.

### The Contract
The contract adds +4 points to a player if they choose A0, and subtracts 4 points from the other player.
- **If both choose A0:** Each receives +4 and gives away 4. Net change: 0.
  Payoffs remain **(5, 5)**.
- **If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:** Player 2 receives +4 and Player 1 loses 4.
  Payoff: (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = **(4, -1)**.
- **If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:** Player 2 loses 4 and Player 1 receives +4.
  Payoff: (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = **(-1, 4)**.
- **If both choose A1:** No points are exchanged.
  Payoffs remain **(3, 3)**.

### Game with the Contract
Modified Payoffs (Player 2, Player 1):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this modified game, let's look for dominant strategies for Player 2:
- If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets **5** (A0) vs -1 (A1).
- If Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets **4** (A0) vs 3 (A1).

In both cases, A0 is now the dominant strategy for Player 2. Naturally, the same logic applies to Player 1. This means that if the contract is signed, both players are incentivized to choose A0, leading to a stable and guaranteed outcome of 5 points.

### Conclusion
Without the contract, Player 2 might settle for the safer A1 (3 points) to avoid the risk of getting 0. With the contract, A0 becomes the safest and most rewarding strategy (guaranteeing at least 4 points and incentivizing a 5-point outcome). Since Player 1 proposed this contract, they are likely to sign it. Signing the contract as Player 2 maximizes the expected total points and eliminates coordination risk.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the game's payoffs before and after the contract is applied.

### Original Game Payoffs:
The original payoff matrix is as follows:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding (5, 5) and (A1, A1) yielding (3, 3). While (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant (offering the highest points), (A1, A1) is a safer option for risk-averse players because choosing A1 guarantees at least 3 points, whereas A0 risks 0 points if the other player moves to A1.

### Game Payoffs with the Contract:
The contract states that any player choosing A0 receives 4 points from the other player. Let's recalculate the matrix:
- **(A0, A0):** Both receive 5 points. (5 + 4 - 4 = 5 for each)
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 (+4), Player 2 chooses A1 (0). 
  - Player 1: 0 (original) + 4 (bonus) = 4
  - Player 2: 3 (original) - 4 (payment) = -1
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1 (0), Player 2 chooses A0 (+4). 
  - Player 1: 3 (original) - 4 (payment) = -1
  - Player 2: 0 (original) + 4 (bonus) = 4
- **(A1, A1):** No bonus applies. (3, 3)

New matrix:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### Strategic Analysis:
1. **Dominant Strategy:** Under the contract, A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players.
   - If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1).
   - If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1).
   In both cases, A0 is superior. The same applies to Player 2.
2. **Impact on Outcome:** Without the contract, players might play A1 to avoid the risk of 0. With the contract, players are incentivized to play A0 even if they fear the other player might choose A1 (since 4 > 3).
3. **Maximizing Points:** The contract effectively locks the players into the (A0, A0) outcome, resulting in 5 points each, which is the maximum possible score in the original game. It eliminates the coordination risk and ensures the best possible outcome.

Since the contract makes the best outcome more stable and certain by creating a dominant strategy for A0, it is beneficial for Player 1.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the game's payoffs and how the contract changes them.

### 1. Original Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2)
The original payoff matrix is:
- **(A0, A0):** (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** (0, 3)
- **(A1, A0):** (3, 0)
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)

In this game, both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash equilibria. However, A1 is a "safer" choice because playing A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's decision, whereas playing A0 could result in 0 points if the other player chooses A1. For Player 1 to prefer A0, they must believe there is a greater than 60% probability ($p > 0.6$) that Player 2 will also play A0.

### 2. Contracted Payoffs
The contract states that if a player chooses A0, they receive 1 point from the other player. If both sign, the payoffs become:
- **(A0, A0):** Player 1 gets 5 (original) + 1 (from P2) - 1 (to P2) = 5; Player 2 gets the same = (5, 5).
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 gets 0 (original) + 1 (from P2) = 1; Player 2 gets 3 (original) - 1 (to P1) = 2.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 gets 3 (original) - 1 (to P2) = 2; Player 2 gets 0 (original) + 1 (from P1) = 1.
- **(A1, A1):** Both stay at the original 3 points = (3, 3).

### 3. Comparison and Strategy
Comparing the original and contracted matrices:
- **Risk Mitigation:** In the contracted game, the penalty for playing A0 when the other player plays A1 is reduced (you get 1 point instead of 0). 
- **Incentive Shift:** In the contracted game, the payoff for playing A1 when the other player plays A0 is reduced (you get 2 points instead of 3).
- **Equilibrium Analysis:** In the contracted game, Player 1 prefers A0 if the probability that Player 2 plays A0 is greater than 40% ($p > 0.4$). This is a significant improvement over the original 60% threshold.

### 4. Conclusion
The contract, proposed by Player 2, makes the mutually beneficial (5, 5) outcome more robust and less risky. It penalizes the "safe" strategy (A1) if the other player tries to coordinate on A0, and it provides a small buffer for the player attempting to coordinate on A0. This shift in incentives makes it easier for both players to choose A0 with confidence.

Since Player 2 proposed the contract, they are highly likely to sign it and subsequently play A0. Signing the contract is in Player 1's best interest to maximize total points.

response:
To determine whether Player 1 should sign the contract, let's analyze the payoffs in both the original game and the contract-modified game.

### 1. Original Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for the original game (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5 points.
- **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3 points.
While (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant (yielding 5 instead of 3), it is also risky. If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 receives 0 points. Consequently, both players might default to A1 to ensure a payoff of 3.

### 2. Contract-Modified Game Analysis
The contract specifies: If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player.
Let's recalculate the payoffs:
- **(A0, A0)**: Both choose A0. 
  - Player 1: 5 (base) + 4 (bonus) - 4 (payment to P2) = 5
  - Player 2: 5 (base) + 4 (bonus) - 4 (payment to P1) = 5
- **(A0, A1)**: Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1.
  - Player 1: 0 (base) + 4 (bonus) - 0 (no payment to P2) = 4
  - Player 2: 3 (base) + 0 (no bonus) - 4 (payment to P1) = -1
- **(A1, A0)**: Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0.
  - Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 (no bonus) - 4 (payment to P2) = -1
  - Player 2: 0 (base) + 4 (bonus) - 0 (no payment to P1) = 4
- **(A1, A1)**: Neither chooses A0.
  - Player 1: 3 (base) = 3
  - Player 2: 3 (base) = 3

### 3. Conclusion and Decision
In the contract-modified game, Player 1's best response to A0 is A0 (5 > -1) and their best response to A1 is A0 (4 > 3). Therefore, **A0 becomes a dominant strategy** for both players. This ensures the game reaches the (A0, A0) outcome, providing Player 1 with a payoff of 5.

Compared to the original game, the contract removes the risk associated with choosing A0. If Player 2 plays A1 while Player 1 plays A0, Player 1 now receives 4 points (with the contract) instead of 0 points (without the contract). Since the contract stabilizes the payoff-dominant outcome, signing it is the optimal choice.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we must first analyze the payoff matrix using both the base game rules and the additional contract.

### 1. Basic Payoff Matrix
The original payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) are:
*   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 3)
*   (A1, A0): (3, 0)
*   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### 2. Impact of the Contract
The contract stipulates that any player choosing **A0** receives 4 points, which are drawn equally from the other players. In a two-player game, this means a player who chooses A0 gains 4 points, and the other player loses 4 points.
*   **If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:** You both receive +4 and lose -4. The net change is 0. Final: (5, 5).
*   **If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:** You receive +4, and the other player loses 4. Final: (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = (4, -1).
*   **If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:** The other player receives +4, and you lose 4. Final: (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = (-1, 4).
*   **If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:** No one chooses A0, so there are no additional payments. Final: (3, 3).

### 3. Revised Payoff Matrix
The new payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:
| | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **Player 1: A1** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

### 4. Strategy Analysis
*   **If Player 2 chooses A0:** Your choice is between A0 (5 points) and A1 (-1 point). A0 is clearly better.
*   **If Player 2 chooses A1:** Your choice is between A0 (4 points) and A1 (3 points). A0 is still better.

Regardless of what the other player does, choosing **A0** results in a higher payoff for you. This makes A0 a **strictly dominant strategy**. Furthermore, (A0, A0) results in the highest possible total points for the group (10), making it the most beneficial outcome both individually and collectively.

### Final Decision
Given that A0 is the dominant strategy and leads to the highest payoff in all scenarios, you should allocate 100% of your probability to A0.

2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are Player 2 (you), and we are playing a simultaneous-move game with another player (Player 1).

Actions: A0, A1

Payoff matrix (Player 2's payoff, since you are Player 2):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 5      | 0      |
| **P2: A1** | 3      | 3      |

So, as Player 2:
- If you play A0 and P1 plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0 and P1 plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 and P1 plays A0 → you get 3
- If you play A1 and P1 plays A1 → you get 3

Now, we want to find the **Nash equilibrium** of this game to understand what rational players would do without contracts.

---

### **Step 2: Find Equilibrium in the Base Game**

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium.

Let Player 1 play A0 with probability **p**, A1 with **1-p**.

Let Player 2 play A0 with probability **q**, A1 with **1-q**.

We’ll look for symmetric or mixed-strategy equilibria.

#### Player 2’s expected payoff from choosing A0:
- vs P1 A0 (prob p): 5
- vs P1 A1 (prob 1-p): 0
→ Expected: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p

#### Player 2’s expected payoff from choosing A1:
- vs P1 A0: 3
- vs P1 A1: 3
→ Expected: 3

For Player 2 to be indifferent between A0 and A1 (in a mixed strategy), we set:
5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So if Player 1 plays A0 with 0.6, then Player 2 is indifferent.

Similarly, to find Player 1’s equilibrium, we can reverse roles.

But since you are Player 2, and we're analyzing what happens when players act rationally, in a symmetric game, **the only Nash equilibria** are:
- (A0, A0): Both play A0 — but is this stable?
  - If P1 plays A0, P2 wants to play A0 (5 > 3) → yes.
  - If P2 plays A0, P1 wants to play A0 (5 > 3) → yes.
  → So (A0, A0) is a pure Nash equilibrium.

- (A1, A1): Both play A1 — payoff 3 each
  - If P1 plays A1, P2’s best response: A1 (3) vs A0 (0) → so A1 is better.
  - Similarly for P1 → so (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

- And possibly a mixed equilibrium.

But (A0, A0) gives both 5 — best for both — but is it *strongly* stable? Not necessarily: if both think the other will play A0, they’re better off sticking to A0. But A1 is a safe play: you always get 3.

But notice: if Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so prefers A0. But if Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 prefers A1 (3 > 0). So, **A0 is not a dominant strategy**. Similarly, A1 is not a dominant strategy (A0 gives 5 if P1 plays A0, vs 3 if P1 plays A1).

So we have **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), and possibly a mixed one.

But (A0,A0) is payoff-dominant (5 each), while (A1,A1) gives 3 each. But (A0,A0) is vulnerable: if there’s any doubt, players may deviate.

Still, this is important: **if no contracts, rational players may play (A0,A0) if they can coordinate**, or (A1,A1) if not.

But in this game with no communication, it’s unclear. However, **with contracts**, we can try to induce (A0, A0), which is best for both.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contracts**

Now, contracts are proposed. Each contract adds transfers based on actions.

Each contract defines:
- If you play A0, you get an **additional payment**.
- That money is **drawn equally from the other player**.

So:
- If a player plays A0, they gain **X points**.
- The opponent **loses X points** (since it's "drawn equally from the other player").

But wait: "drawn equally from the other players" — since there are two players, if a player gains X for playing A0, then the other player loses X? Or is it split?

Let’s examine wording:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn equally from the other players" — plural? But there's only one other player.

So we interpret: the additional payment comes from the **other player** (i.e., the opponent). So if you play A0, you get +4, and the opponent loses 4.

**Important**: The payment is **per player** who plays A0. So if **both** play A0, each gets +4, and each loses 4 — so **net zero**? No — let’s clarify.

Wait: if **a player** plays A0, they get +4, and **the other player** loses 4.

But suppose **both** play A0:
- Player 1: gets +4
- Player 2: gets +4
- But the cost: "drawn equally from the other players" — if both are gaining, from whom are they drawing?

Ah — this is ambiguous.

But likely, the interpretation is:
- The **additional payment** is funded by the other player(s). Since there’s one other player, the payment comes entirely from them.

Therefore:
- If **only one** player plays A0, that player gains +4, the other loses 4.
- If **both** play A0, each gains +4, and each loses 4 from the other → **net zero** for both — so the +4 and –4 cancel.

But that can’t be! How can both gain and lose?

Wait — this suggests that the **payment is not symmetric**.

Let’s think again.

If Player 1 plays A0:
- Player 1 gets +4
- Player 2 loses 4 → so total points: Player 1: +4, Player 2: -4

Same if Player 2 plays A0:
- Player 2 gets +4
- Player 1 loses 4

Now, if **both** play A0:
- Player 1 gets +4 (from contract), but loses 4 (to Player 2) → net 0
- Player 2 gets +4 and loses 4 → net 0
→ So contract has **no net effect** if both play A0.

Similarly, if neither plays A0 → no effect.

Only when **only one plays A0** does the contract shift points.

But that seems odd.

Wait — this contradicts the idea of "drawn equally from the other players".

Another interpretation: **the money is pooled from both players**?

But no — it says "drawn equally from the other players".

Since you are a player, if **you** play A0, the money is drawn equally from **the other players** — i.e., the other one player.

So: you get +4, the other player loses 4. So net: –4 total (you gain 4, opponent loses 4 → sum of points decreases by 0? No: you gain 4, they lose 4 → total sum unchanged). Wait: total points in the game are preserved.

In the base game, total payoff is:
- (A0,A0): 5+5 = 10
- (A0,A1): 0+3 = 3
- (A1,A0): 3+0 = 3
- (A1,A1): 3+3 = 6

Now, with contract:
If Player 2 plays A0 → she gets +4, Player 1 loses 4.
If Player 1 plays A0 → he gets +4, Player 2 loses 4.

So the total payoff sum is reduced only by the contract **if both play A0**, both gain and lose → no net change.

But if only one plays A0, then one gains 4, the other loses 4 → total sum unchanged.

So the **contract does not change the total sum of payoffs** — it’s a transfer.

But if both play A0, each gains 4 and loses 4 → net 0. So **no change**.

If only one plays A0, that player gains 4, the other loses 4 → net 0.

So the contract **only redistributes points**, doesn’t create or destroy them.

So this is consistent.

But now: **what matters is the net effect on your payoffs**, including the contract.

So let’s analyze each contract with this in mind.

We are **Player 2**, and we want to **maximize our expected total points**, including the contract.

We also know that:
- Contracts are voted on via approval voting.
- The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So our goal is not only to **approve contracts that are good for us**, but also to **get high approval**, because if many others approve, our chances of a good contract being selected increase.

But there’s only one other player (Player 1), and two contracts: C1 and C2.

Player 1 proposed C1, Player 2 proposed C2.

We are Player 2. So we are **not** the proposer of C1.

Now, we decide whether to **approve** C1 and/or C2.

The contracts are:
- C1 (proposed by Player 1): If a player plays A0, they get +4, drawn from the other player.
- C2 (proposed by Player 2): If a player plays A0, they get +2, drawn from the other player.

We are to output:
```json
{"C1": true/false, "C2": true/false}
```

We must **approve** contracts that we think are good for us (Player 2), and **not** approve ones that hurt us.

But also: **we want the winning contract to be one that maximizes our total payoff**.

So we must evaluate each contract in terms of:
1. What is the **equilibrium outcome** (actions chosen) under that contract?
2. What is our **expected payoff** in that equilibrium?
3. Will we, as Player 2, benefit from the contract?

Note: The other player (Player 1) will also act rationally.

So we need to analyze the **game under each contract**, find the **Nash equilibria**, and then see what happens.

Let’s do that.

---

## **Contract C1: +4 for playing A0, drawn from the other player**

So the **total payoff** for each player is:
- Base payoff (from game) + contract bonus (if they played A0)

So let’s write the **new payoff matrix** for Player 2 (you), under C1.

### C1 Payoff Matrix (Player 2's perspective)

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 5 + 4 = 9 | 0 + 4 = 4 |
| **P2: A1** | 3 + 0 = 3 | 3 + 0 = 3 |

Wait — why?

- If P2 plays A0:
  - If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 (base) + 4 (contract) = 9
  - If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0 (base) + 4 (contract) = 4

- If P2 plays A1:
  - If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3 (base) + 0 (no A0) = 3
  - If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 3 (base) + 0 = 3

Now, does P2 have a dominant strategy?

- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (9 > 3)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A0 (4 > 3)

So **A0 is strictly dominant** for Player 2 under C1.

Now, what about Player 1?

Player 1’s payoffs under C1:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5 + 4 = 9 | 3 + 0 = 3 |
| **P1: A1** | 0 + 0 = 0 | 3 + 0 = 3 |

Check:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 prefers A0 (9 > 0)
- If P2 plays A1: P1 is indifferent (3 vs 3) → A1 is no worse.

So P1 will play A0 if P2 plays A0, and P1 can play A1 if P2 plays A1.

But since P2 is playing A0 (dominant), P1 will best respond with A0.

So **equilibrium: both play A0**

- P2 gets 9
- P1 gets 9

But wait: let’s double-check the contract: if **P1 plays A0**, he gets +4, but **P2 loses 4** because P2 is the other player. Similarly, if P2 plays A0, he gets +4, P1 loses 4.

So in the outcome (A0, A0):
- P2 gets base 5 + contract +4 = 9
- But P1 lost 4 to P2 → so P1's total: 5 (base) - 4 (lost to P2) = 1?

Wait — **this is the confusion**.

Let’s clarify the **contract mechanism** carefully.

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- When **you** play A0, you get +4 **from the other player**.
- So if **both** play A0:
  - P2 gets +4 (from P1)
  - P1 gets +4 (from P2)
  → But P2 **loses 4 to P1**, and P1 **loses 4 to P2**

So:
- P2: base payoff 5 + receive 4 (from P1) - pay 4 (to P1) = 5
- P1: base payoff 5 + receive 4 (from P2) - pay 4 (to P2) = 5

Wait — so **the contract cancels out** when both play A0.

But if **only one** plays A0, then:
- That player gets +4 and the other loses 4

So it’s **only the player who plays A0 and is the only one** who benefits.

But the description says: "drawn equally from the other players" — if only one other player, they pay the full amount.

Let’s re-analyze.

Suppose:
- P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1

Then:
- P2: plays A0 → gets +4; the payment is drawn from the other player → P1 pays 4 → so P2 gets +4
- P1: plays A1 → no payment; but since P2 played A0, P1 is **forced** to pay 4 to P2

So:
- P2: base payoff = 0 (A0 vs A1) + 4 = 4
- P1: base payoff = 3 (A1 vs A0) - 4 = -1

Similarly:
- If P2 plays A1, P1 plays A0:
  - P1: base 5 + 4 = 9
  - P2: base 0 - 4 = -4

- If both A0:
  - P2: base 5 + 4 (from P1) - 4 (to P1) = 5
  - P1: base 5 + 4 (from P2) - 4 (to P2) = 5

- If both A1:
  - No one plays A0 → no payments → payoffs = 3 each

So the **true payoff matrix under C1** (for Player 2):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 5      | 4      |
| **P2: A1** | -4     | 3      |

Explanation:
- (A0,A0): P2 gets 5 (base) +4 (from P1) -4 (to P1) = 5
- (A0,A1): P2 gets 0 (base) +4 (from P1) = 4 (P1 pays 4)
- (A1,A0): P2 gets 3 (base) -4 (to P1, because P1 played A0) = -1? Wait

Wait: when P1 plays A0, P1 gets +4, and **draws from P2** → so P2 **pays 4** to P1.

So:
- (A1,A0): P2 plays A1 → gets no contract bonus → but P1 played A0 → so P2 pays 4 to P1
  → P2's total: base 3 (since A1 vs A0) - 4 = -1

But earlier I wrote -4 — that was wrong.

So correction:

- (A1,A0): P2: base 3 (A1 vs A0) - 4 (payment to P1) = -1
- (A1,A1): base 3 + 0 = 3

So corrected matrix for **Player 2 under C1**:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 5      | 4      |
| **P2: A1** | -1     | 3      |

Similarly, for **Player 1 under C1**:

- (A0,A0): 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
- (A0,A1): 0 + 4 (from P2) - 4 (to P2) = 0? Wait

Wait — when P2 plays A0, P2 gets +4 from P1 → so P1 pays 4 to P2

So in (A0,A1): P1 played A0, so gets +4 from P2 → but P2 played A0 → so P1 pays 4 to P2 → so:
- P1: base 3 (A0 vs A1) +4 (from P2) -4 (to P2) = 3

Similarly, in (A1,A0): P1 played A0 → gets +4 from P2 → but P2 played A1 → so **P2 does not play A0**, so P1 **cannot draw from P2**.

Wait — that’s critical.

### Key Clarification:

The **contract payment is only triggered if you play A0**.

- If you play A0, you get +4 from the **other player(s)**.
- If the other player **did not play A0**, they do **not** have to pay you.

But who pays?

The contract says: "drawn equally from the other players."

But if the other player does not play A0, they don’t get the bonus, so **they cannot be forced** to pay, right?

This is ambiguous.

But logically, the only way the payment can be drawn is if the **other player** is also playing A0. Otherwise, they don’t have extra points to give.

But that contradicts the phrasing.

Alternative interpretation: **the player who plays A0 receives the payment regardless** — and it’s **taken from the other player**, even if the other player didn’t play A0.

But that’s unfair: if P1 plays A0, he gets +4, even though P2 played A1 → P2 must pay him 4, even though P2 didn’t get any bonus.

This is possible — it's a **transfer** based on action, not on the other player's action.

So let's assume: **whenever you play A0, you get +4, and that is deducted from the other player (regardless of what they play)**.

This is the **only way** to make sense of the mechanism.

So:
- If P2 plays A0, P2 gets +4, P1 loses 4.
- If P1 plays A0, P1 gets +4, P2 loses 4.

Independent of what the other plays.

This creates a **cross-transfer**.

So under C1:

### **Player 2's total payoff (A0 vs A1):**

| P1 | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----|--------|--------|
| A0 | 5 (base) +4 (contract) -4 (P1 plays A0, so P2 pays 4) = 5 | 3 (base) -4 (P1 plays A0, so P2 pays 4) = -1 |
| A1 | 0 (base) +4 (P2 plays A0) = 4 | 3 (base) = 3 |

Wait: if P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A1:
- P2 gets +4 (because P2 played A0)
- P1 does **not** get +4 (because P1 played A1), but P2 played A0, so P1 **loses 4** to P2

So:
- P2: base 0 +4 = 4
- P1: base 3 -4 = -1

Similarly:
- If P2 plays A0, P1 plays A0:
  - P2: base 5 +4 (contract) -4 (P1 played A0, so P2 pays 4) = 5
  - P1: base 5 +4 (contract) -4 (P2 played A0, so P1 pays 4) = 5

- If P2 plays A1, P1 plays A0:
  - P2: base 3 (A1 vs A0) -4 (P1 played A0, so P2 pays 4) = -1
  - P1: base 3 +4 = 7

- If P2 plays A1, P1 plays A1:
  - Both not A0? Wait — P1 played A1, so no contract
  - P2 played A1, so no contract
  → both get base 3

So final **matrix for Player 2 under C1**:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 5      | 4      |
| **P2: A1** | -1     | 3      |

Now, find Nash equilibrium.

Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (5 > -1)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A0 (4 > 3)

So **A0 is strictly dominant for P2**

Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (if A0) or 7 (if A1)? No

P1’s payoffs under C1:

- (A0,A0): 5 (base) +4 (contract) -4 (P2 played A0) = 5
- (A0,A1): 3 (base) +4 (contract) = 7
- (A1,A0): 3 (base) -4 (P2 played A0) = -1
- (A1,A1): 3 (base) = 3

So:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 7 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is strictly dominant for P1 too**

Thus, **unique Nash: (A0,A0)**

- P2 gets 5 (base) +4 (contract) -4 (payment to P1) = 5
- But from matrix: 5 → so no gain from contract in this outcome?

Wait — in (A0,A0), P2 gets:
- Base: 5
- Contract: +4 (played A0)
- Payment: -4 (because P1 played A0) → so net = 5

Same as base.

So **contract C1 has no effect** in (A0,A0) — net zero.

But is that always true?

It is if you play A0 and the other does too.

But P2's payoff is 5 regardless.

P1 also gets 5.

But if **P2 had played A1**, she would have gotten 3 in (A1,A1) or -1 in (A1,A0), so she is better off playing A0.

But in equilibrium, she gets 5.

So under C1, **you get 5 points**, same as without contract.

But is there a better equilibrium?

No — it's unique.

But wait: could they coordinate on (A0,A0)? Already does.

Now, **C2: +2 for playing A0, drawn from the other player**

Same structure.

### **Player 2's payoff under C2:**

- If P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A0: 5 +2 -2 = 5
- If P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A1: 0 +2 = 2
- If P2 plays A1 and P1 plays A0: 3 -2 = 1
- If P2 plays A1 and P1 plays A1: 3

So matrix:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 5      | 2      |
| **P2: A1** | 1      | 3      |

Now, find equilibria.

Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (5 > 1)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A0 (2 > 3)? No — 2 < 3 → prefers A1

So **not dominant**.

Player 1’s payoffs under C2:

- (A0,A0): 5 +2 -2 = 5
- (A0,A1): 3 +2 = 5
- (A1,A0): 3 -2 = 1
- (A1,A1): 3

So:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0

So P1 **always** plays A0

Now, if P1 plays A0, P2:
- A0: 5
- A1: 1 → prefers A0

So **equilibrium: both play A0**

P2 gets 5

Same as before.

But what if P2 plays A1? P1 still plays A0 → P2 gets 1

Only if P2 plays A1 and P1 plays A1, but P1 would not play A1 if P2 plays A1?

P1’s best response to P2 playing A1 is A0 (5 > 3)

So P1 always plays A0

Then P2 best response is A0 (5 > 1)

So again, (A0,A0) is the only equilibrium.

P2 gets 5.

So under **both C1 and C2**, **equilibrium is (A0,A0)**, and you get **5 points**.

But wait — under C1, if P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A1, you get 4, but P1 plays A0, so this doesn’t happen.

So in equilibrium, you get 5.

But is there a difference?

**No — both contracts lead to the same outcome: P2 gets 5.**

But we must also consider: **do you want the contract to be approved?**

But the **contract is selected at random from those with the most approvals**.

So you want to **maximize the chance** that the **preferred contract wins**.

But both contracts lead to the same outcome: 5 points.

So why prefer one over the other?

Wait — but we haven’t considered **what Player 1 wants**.

Player 1 proposed C1 (high incentive), and may **approve only C1**.

But you (Player 2) are deciding whether to approve C1 or C2.

Let’s see what **Player 1** gets under each contract.

Under **C1**:
- (A0,A0): P1 gets 5 (base) +4 (contract) -4 (P2 played A0) = 5
- Same as without contract

Under **C2**:
- P1 gets 5 +2 -2 = 5

So **P1 also gets 5** under both contracts.

So P1 is indifferent between C1 and C2.

But C1 gives P1 a bigger contract bonus (4) but also forces him to pay more if P2 plays A0.

But net, same result.

So P1 likely approves **both** contracts, since he gets the same outcome.

Now, you (Player 2) get 5 in both.

So it doesn’t matter?

Wait — is there an **asymmetric effect**?

Wait: in **C1**, the transfer is **+4/-4**, which is larger.

But net effect cancels.

But perhaps **P2 could get more if they could avoid the payment**?

No — in the unique equilibrium, both play A0, so the +4 and -4 cancel.

So you get 5.

So under both contracts, you get 5.

So you are **indifferent**.

But we must decide whether to **approve** each contract.

Now, think about **approval voting**:

- If you approve C2, and P1 approves C1 and C2, then:
  - C1: 1 approval (P1)
  - C2: 2 approvals (you and P1) → C2 wins

- If you approve only C1, then:
  - C1: 2 approvals (you and P1)
  - C2: 1 approval → C1 wins

- If you approve neither, both have 1 → one chosen at random → prob 0.5 C1, 0.5 C2

But since you get same payoff under either, you are indifferent.

But you might want to **maximize the chance** of winning, or choose one.

But you get **same payoff** in both outcomes.

So **no difference**.

But is the outcome really the same?

Wait: what if there is a **mixed strategy** equilibrium?

But earlier we showed that both C1 and C2 lead to **strictly dominant strategies** or **unique pure equilibrium**.

For C2:

- P1 always plays A0 (as best response to any P2 action)
- P2, if P1 plays A0, plays A0 (5 > 1)
→ so (A0,A0) is the only equilibrium.

Similarly for C1.

So both lead to (A0,A0), and you get 5 points.

So **no difference**.

But wait — is there a **risk**? What if players don’t coordinate?

But in both cases, the equilibrium is **unique and dominant**.

So you get 5.

But you are **Player 2**, and C2 is **proposed by you**.

You might **want it to be approved** so it wins.

But if you approve C2, and P1 approves both, then C2 wins.

If you don't approve C2, and P1 approves both, then C1 wins.

But both give you 5.

But what if P1 **only approves C1**?

Then:
- If you approve C1 only: C1 has 2, C2 has 1 → C1 wins
- If you approve C2 only: C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → random selection → 50% chance of C2 win
- If you approve both: C1:1, C2:2 → C2 wins for sure

So to **maximize chance of C2 winning**, you should approve C2 and **C1**, so C2 has 2 approvals (you and P1), C1 has 1.

But you get same payoff in both.

So **no reason not to approve C2** — if you approve it, you increase its chance of winning.

But what if you approve C1 only?

You might be forcing C1 to win, but you get no better payoff.

But you are **not forced** to approve.

Since C2 is **your own proposal**, you **should want it approved and to win**.

But even if you don't approve it, it might win.

But to **maximize its chance**, you should approve it.

But approval is **free** — and you get **same payoff**.

So you might as well approve C2.

But what about C1?

If you approve C1, you might help C1 win, which is not your proposal.

But since C1 gives same payoff, it doesn't hurt.

But if you approve C1, you **do not help your own contract** as much.

But since P1 is likely to approve both, the only way C2 wins is if you approve it.

So to **maximize the chance** that **you** get the contract you proposed to win, you should **approve C2**.

Approval doesn't cost you anything — because you get the same payoff regardless.

But you should **approve C2**.

You may choose to approve C1 or not.

But if you **don't approve C1**, then C1 has only P1's approval.

C2 has your approval and possibly P1's.

So C2 is more likely to win.

But you don't know if P1 will approve C2.

But as a rational player, you can assume P1, being a self-interested player, will approve both, since both give him 5.

So P1 will approve **both** contracts.

Then:
- If you approve **neither**: both have 1 approval → random → you get 5 with 100% chance (since both give 5)
- If you approve only C1: C1 has 2, C2 has 1 → C1 wins → you get 5
- If you approve only C2: C2 has 2, C1 has 1 → C2 wins → you get 5
- If you approve both: C2 has 2, C1 has 2 → both have 2 approvals → random winner → 50% each → you get 5 in either case

So **in all cases, you get 5**.

So you are **indifferent**.

However, since **C2 is your own proposal**, and you want it to win, you should **approve it** to **increase its chances**.

But approval doesn't cost, so you might as well approve it.

But approval C1? Why?

If you approve C1, you help a contract that is not yours.

But no harm.

But to **maximize the chance** that your preferred contract wins, you should **only approve C2**, and **not C1**, so that C2 has higher approval count.

But P1 may approve both.

So:
- If you approve only C2: C2 has 2 approvals (you and P1), C1 has 1 → C2 wins for sure
- If you approve both: C2 has 2, C1 has 2 → random → 50% C2

So **to maximize chance of C2 winning**, you should **approve only C2, not C1**

And since in both cases you get 5, this is better.

So **you should approve C2, not C1**

Final decision:

- Approve C2: **yes**
- Approve C1: **no**

Because C2 is your proposal, and you want it to be more likely to win, and it gives you same payoff as C1.

Hence, you approve C2, disapprove C1.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we must first calculate the adjusted payoff matrix after accounting for the payment contract. The contract specifies that choosing A0 results in a net transfer of 1 point from the other player to the chooser.

1.  **Calculate Adjusted Payoffs:**
    *   **(A0, A0):** Initial (5, 5). Player 1 gets +1 from Player 2, and Player 2 gets +1 from Player 1. Net: (5, 5).
    *   **(A0, A1):** Initial (0, 3). Player 1 gets +1 from Player 2. Net: (1, 2).
    *   **(A1, A0):** Initial (3, 0). Player 2 gets +1 from Player 1. Net: (2, 1).
    *   **(A1, A1):** Initial (3, 3). No transfers. Net: (3, 3).

2.  **Analyze the Payoff Matrix:**
    *   If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 receives 5 points from A0 and 2 points from A1. A0 is the best response.
    *   If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 receives 1 point from A0 and 3 points from A1. A1 is the best response.
    *   This identifies two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5) and (A1, A1) with payoffs (3, 3).

3.  **Strategic Selection:**
    *   Both players aim to maximize their total points.
    *   (A0, A0) is Pareto superior to (A1, A1) as it provides a higher payoff for both players (5 vs 3).
    *   Since both players are incentivized to reach the highest mutually beneficial outcome and (A0, A0) is a stable equilibrium, the rational choice to maximize points is to play A0.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (my perspective as Player 2)

Original payoff matrix:
```
                P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0          5, 5      0, 3
P2: A1          3, 0      3, 3
```

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

If the contract is signed:
- When a player plays A0: they get +4 from the other player
- When a player plays A1: no additional payment

New payoffs:
```
                P1: A0              P1: A1
P2: A0          5+4-4, 5+4-4        0+4, 3-4
                = 5, 5              = 4, -1

P2: A1          3-4, 0+4            3, 3
                = -1, 4
```

## Step 3: Analyze the game WITH contract

From my perspective (Player 2):
- If P1 plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If P1 plays A1: I get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy!**

From Player 1's perspective:
- If I play A0: P1 gets 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If I play A1: P1 gets 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 becomes Player 1's dominant strategy too!**

## Step 4: Analyze the game WITHOUT contract

The original game has two pure Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: payoffs (5, 5) - the good equilibrium
- **(A1, A1)**: payoffs (3, 3) - the worse equilibrium

There's also a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both players play A0 with probability 3/5, yielding expected payoff of 3.

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

**Without contract**: Coordination problem between multiple equilibria. Expected payoff could be 3 (mixed) or 3 (bad equilibrium) or 5 (good equilibrium but requires coordination).

**With contract**: (A0, A0) becomes the unique dominant strategy equilibrium with guaranteed payoff of **5**.

## Conclusion

The contract eliminates coordination risk and guarantees the best outcome for both players. I should sign.

response:
To maximize the points received, we first analyze the base payoff matrix for Player 2 (you) and Player 1:

*   (P2: A0, P1: A0): P2 = 5, P1 = 5
*   (P2: A0, P1: A1): P2 = 0, P1 = 3
*   (P2: A1, P1: A0): P2 = 3, P1 = 0
*   (P2: A1, P1: A1): P2 = 3, P1 = 3

Next, we incorporate the contract:
*   Choosing A0 grants a player +4 points, which is subtracted from the other player.
*   Choosing A1 results in 0 additional points.

Adjusted payoff matrix after the contract:
1.  **(P2: A0, P1: A0):**
    *   P2 base payoff = 5.
    *   P2 gets +4 for choosing A0 and pays -4 for P1 choosing A0.
    *   Final P2 = 5 + 4 - 4 = 5. Final P1 = 5 + 4 - 4 = 5.
2.  **(P2: A0, P1: A1):**
    *   P2 base payoff = 0.
    *   P2 gets +4 for choosing A0. P1 pays -4 for P2 choosing A0.
    *   Final P2 = 0 + 4 = 4. Final P1 = 3 - 4 = -1.
3.  **(P2: A1, P1: A0):**
    *   P2 base payoff = 3.
    *   P2 pays -4 for P1 choosing A0. P1 gets +4 for choosing A0.
    *   Final P2 = 3 - 4 = -1. Final P1 = 0 + 4 = 4.
4.  **(P2: A1, P1: A1):**
    *   P2 base payoff = 3.
    *   No addition or subtraction.
    *   Final P2 = 3. Final P1 = 3.

Analyzing Player 2's options:
*   If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 5 points with A0 versus -1 with A1.
*   If Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 4 points with A0 versus 3 with A1.

In both scenarios, A0 provides a higher payoff for Player 2, making it a strictly dominant strategy. The same logic applies to Player 1, making (A0, A0) the dominant strategy Nash Equilibrium for the game.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
The game's outcome is determined by the combination of the base payoffs and the additional contract signed by both players. Let's analyze the modified payoff matrix step by step.

### 1. Base Payoffs (P1, P2)
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### 2. Contract Impact
The contract states that any player choosing A0 receives +4 points, which is subtracted from the other player.
- **If both choose A0**: 
    - Player 1 receives +4 (for choosing A0) and loses 4 (because Player 2 chose A0). Net change: 0.
    - Player 2 receives +4 (for choosing A0) and loses 4 (because Player 1 chose A0). Net change: 0.
    - **Final: (5+0, 5+0) = (5, 5)**
- **If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1**: 
    - Player 1 receives +4 (for choosing A0). 
    - Player 2 loses 4 (because Player 1 chose A0).
    - **Final: (0+4, 3-4) = (4, -1)**
- **If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0**: 
    - Player 1 loses 4 (because Player 2 chose A0).
    - Player 2 receives +4 (for choosing A0).
    - **Final: (3-4, 0+4) = (-1, 4)**
- **If both choose A1**: 
    - Neither player receives or loses any points from the contract.
    - **Final: (3, 3)**

### 3. Modified Payoff Matrix
| | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **Player 1: A1** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

### 4. Strategic Analysis
To find the optimal strategy, we check for dominant strategies in the modified matrix:
- **For Player 1**:
    - If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 5 from A0 and -1 from A1. (A0 is better)
    - If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 4 from A0 and 3 from A1. (A0 is better)
    - Player 1 has a **dominant strategy: A0**.
- **For Player 2**:
    - The game is symmetric. If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets 5 from A0 and -1 from A1. (A0 is better)
    - If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets 4 from A0 and 3 from A1. (A0 is better)
    - Player 2 has a **dominant strategy: A0**.

### 5. Conclusion
A0 is the strictly dominant strategy for both players, leading to a Nash Equilibrium at (A0, A0). Furthermore, (A0, A0) provides the highest possible individual and combined payoffs in the entire matrix. Rational players will choose A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

response:
To maximize the points in this game, we must first analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating the effects of the contract into the base payoffs.

**1. Analyze the Base Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
*   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
*   (A0, A1): (3, 0)  — *If P2 chooses A1 and P1 chooses A0, P2 gets 0 and P1 gets 3.*
*   (A1, A0): (0, 3)  — *If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1, P2 gets 3 and P1 gets 0.*
*   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**2. Incorporate the Contract:**
The contract states that any player choosing A0 receives 1 point from the other player.
*   **(A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives 1 point and gives 1 point. Net change is 0.
    *   Result: (5+1-1, 5+1-1) = **(5, 5)**
*   **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1. P1 receives 1 point from P2.
    *   Result: (3+1, 0-1) = **(4, -1)**
*   **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0. P2 receives 1 point from P1.
    *   Result: (0-1, 3+1) = **(-1, 4)**
*   **(A1, A1):** Neither player chooses A0. No payments are made.
    *   Result: **(3, 3)**

**3. Identify Nash Equilibria:**
*   If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2’s best response is A0 (5 vs -1).
*   If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2’s best response is A1 (3 vs 4?? No, wait):
    *   *Correction on (A1, A0):* Original description: "If you (P2) choose A0 and the other player (P1) chooses A1: you get 0, the other player gets 3."
    *   Wait, let's re-read: "If you (P2) choose A0 and the other player (P1) chooses A1: you get 0, the other player gets 3."
    *   Revised (A1, A0) with contract: P1=A1, P2=A0. P2 gets 0+1=1. P1 gets 3-1=2. Matrix: (2, 1).
    *   Revised (A0, A1) with contract: P1=A0, P2=A1. P1 gets 0+1=1. P2 gets 3-1=2. Matrix: (1, 2).

**Revised Matrix (P1, P2):**
*   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
*   (A0, A1): (1, 2)
*   (A1, A0): (2, 1)
*   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this revised matrix, both **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)** are Nash equilibria. However, (A0, A0) is **payoff-dominant** (giving 5 points instead of 3) and **risk-dominant** (the product of the gains for deviating from the other equilibrium is higher for A0). Given that you (Player 2) proposed this contract and it was approved, there is a clear strategic signal and incentive for both players to coordinate on A0 to maximize their total points.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.

- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

===== Response [ID: 94ea8fb8] [2026-01-21 23:31:26] =====
agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to compare the original game's payoff matrix with the payoff matrix that results if the contract is signed by both players.

### 1. Original Game Matrix
The payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2 (P1, P2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Analysis:**
There are two Nash Equilibria in this game: **(A0, A0)** with a payoff of 5 each, and **(A1, A1)** with a payoff of 3 each. However, (A1, A1) is **risk-dominant**. If Player 1 is unsure whether Player 2 will cooperate (play A0) or play it safe (play A1), they are more likely to choose A1, as it guarantees a payoff of 3 regardless of Player 2's action. Specifically, a player must be over 60% certain the other will play A0 to make A0 the rational choice.

### 2. Contract Game Matrix
The contract adds 2 points to a player choosing A0 and subtracts 2 points from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** Both get +2 and then -2. Payoff: (5+2-2, 5+2-2) = **(5, 5)**
- **(A0, A1):** P1 gets +2, P2 gets -2. Payoff: (0+2, 3-2) = **(2, 1)**
- **(A1, A0):** P1 gets -2, P2 gets +2. Payoff: (3-2, 0+2) = **(1, 2)**
- **(A1, A1):** No changes. Payoff: **(3, 3)**

**Analysis:**
The Nash Equilibria remain (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). However, the **risk-dominance** has shifted. In this contracted version, a player only needs to be more than 20% certain that the other player will choose A0 to make A0 the rational choice (expected payoff for A0 is $5p + 2(1-p)$ vs A1 is $1p + 3(1-p)$).

### 3. Comparison and Conclusion
Signing the contract makes the Pareto-optimal outcome (5, 5) significantly more likely and safer to pursue. Without the contract, players are more likely to default to the safer (3, 3) outcome. Since the contract only activates if both players sign, and it essentially "insures" the cooperative choice (A0) against the non-cooperative choice (A1), signing is a beneficial strategic move.

{"sign": true}

Looking at this problem, I need to analyze how each contract affects the game's equilibrium and my payoff.

## Step 1: Understanding the Base Game

Let me first map out the payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) where I am Player 2:

```
              P2: A0    P2: A1
P1: A0        (5,5)     (0,3)
P1: A1        (3,0)     (3,3)
```

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → payoffs (5, 5) - best outcome
- (A1, A1) → payoffs (3, 3) - worse outcome

The problem is coordination risk - we might end up at the inferior equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyzing Contract 1

Contract 1: Playing A0 gives +4 points from the other player.

New payoffs:
```
              P2: A0    P2: A1
P1: A0        (5,5)     (4,-1)
P1: A1        (-1,4)    (3,3)
```

Calculation for each outcome:
- (A0,A0): Base (5,5). Both get +4 and pay -4, net unchanged: (5,5)
- (A0,A1): Base (0,3). P1 gets +4, P2 pays -4: (4,-1)
- (A1,A0): Base (3,0). P2 gets +4, P1 pays -4: (-1,4)
- (A1,A1): Base (3,3), no transfers: (3,3)

**My analysis:**
- If P1 plays A0: I get 5 for A0 vs -1 for A1 → I prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: I get 4 for A0 vs 3 for A1 → I prefer A0

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy!** Same for Player 1. Unique Nash equilibrium: (A0,A0) with payoff 5 for me.

## Step 3: Analyzing Contract 2

Contract 2: Playing A1 costs -1 point paid to the other player.

New payoffs:
```
              P2: A0    P2: A1
P1: A0        (5,5)     (4,-1)
P1: A1        (-1,4)    (3,3)
```

Calculation:
- (A0,A0): No transfers: (5,5)
- (A0,A1): P2 pays 1 to P1: (4,-1)
- (A1,A0): P1 pays 1 to P2: (-1,4)
- (A1,A1): Both pay 1 to each other, cancels out: (3,3)

**My analysis:**
- If P1 plays A0: I get 5 for A0 vs -1 for A1 → I prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: I get -1 for A0 vs 3 for A1 → I prefer A1

For Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 for A0 vs -1 for A1 → P1 prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 4 for A0 vs 3 for A1 → P1 prefers A0

**A0 is P1's dominant strategy.** Given P1 will play A0, I should play A0. Unique Nash equilibrium: (A0,A0) with payoff 5 for me.

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts:
- Eliminate coordination risk
- Ensure we reach (A0,A0)
- Give me a payoff of 5

Without a contract, there's risk we coordinate on (A1,A1) giving only 3 points.

Since both contracts equally benefit me and secure the best outcome, I should approve both to maximize the chance that at least one contract is implemented.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze how the payoff matrices change with and without the contract. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning process:

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoffs without the Contract
We start with the basic payoff matrix provided.

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0  | A1  |
|---------------------|-----|-----|
| A0                  | 5,5 | 0,3 |
| A1                  | 3,0 | 3,3 |

### Step 2: Apply Contract Payments
The contract modifies the payoffs by adding or subtracting points based on the chosen actions.

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 1 point, equally drawn from the other player (so the other player loses 1 point).
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points, distributed equally to the other player (so the other player gains 2 points).

We need to adjust the original payoffs with these new rules.

### Step 3: Adjusted Payoff Matrix with Contract
Let's create the new matrix with the contract.

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0  | A1  |
|---------------------|-----|-----|
| A0                  | 6,4 | 1,1 |  **Explanation**:
| A1                  | 1,6 | 1,1 |  **Explanation**:

**Explanation for each case:**
- If both choose A0: Both players gain 6 points each (5 + 1 - 1 = 5).
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 (0 + 1) points, Player 1 gets 3 (3 - 1) points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 (3 - 2 + 2) points, Player 1 gets 0 (0 + 2) points.
- If both choose A1: Both players get 1 (3 - 2 - 2 + 2 = 1) points.

### Step 4: Analyzing Strategic Choices
We now compare the expected utility with and without the contract.

**Without Contract:**
- Expected payoffs maximize coordination (A0, A0). If both players cooperate, they both get 5 points.

**With Contract:**
- A coordination again maximizes (A0, A0) is 6, 6 points.
- Non-coordination scenarios result in lower payoffs compared to the no-contract option. 

### Step 5: Dominant Strategy and Risk Analysis
The contract incentivizes choosing A0 more strongly because it adjusts the payoff to be higher when choosing without fear of a worse payoff. Coordination on A0 yields the highest joint payoff and mitigates risk.

### Conclusion
By signing the contract, the incentives are better aligned:
- Both players maximize their joint outcomes more reliably by choosing A0, yielding a higher payoff (6 each) if mutual cooperation occurs.

Therefore, signing the contract is advantageous for maximizing my total points considering rational behavior from the other player.

response:
To make a decision about which contracts to approve, I need to consider how they affect the expected points for each action and consequently my overall score. Let's break this down.

### Original Payoff Matrix
Without any contracts, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 5 points
- (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 0 points
- (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 3 points
- (A1, A1): Player 2 gets 3 points

### Analysis of Proposed Contracts

#### Contract 1 (Proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0:
  - No additional payments
- If a player chooses A1:
  - They pay an additional payment of 4 points, which is distributed equally among the other players.

For Player 2:
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points
- (A1, A0): 3 points - 4/2 = 1 point
- (A1, A1): 3 points - 4/2 = 1 point

#### Contract 2 (Proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0:
  - They receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1:
  - They pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

For Player 2:
- (A0, A0): 5 points + 1/2 = 5.5 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points + 1/2 = 0.5 points
- (A1, A0): 3 points - 2/2 = 2 points
- (A1, A1): 3 points - 2/2 = 2 points

### Comparing Expected Outcomes
**With Contract 1:**
- Choosing A0:
  - (A0, A0): 5 points
  - (A0, A1): 0 points
  - Expected value (if equal probabilities for simplicity): (5 + 0)/2 = 2.5 points
- Choosing A1:
  - (A1, A0): 1 point
  - (A1, A1): 1 point
  - Expected value: (1 + 1)/2 = 1 point

**With Contract 2:**
- Choosing A0:
  - (A0, A0): 5.5 points
  - (A0, A1): 0.5 points
  - Expected value: (5.5 + 0.5)/2 = 3 points
- Choosing A1:
  - (A1, A0): 2 points
  - (A1, A1): 2 points
  - Expected value: (2 + 2)/2 = 2 points

### Conclusion
- **Contract 1:** Decreases the expected value when I choose A1 to below the value of choosing A0, making A1 less attractive.
- **Contract 2:** Increases the expected value for choosing A0 more than choosing A1, but both values are higher than the ones with no contract.

Thus, both contracts improve over the no contract scenario, but Contract 2 provides a better outcome for choosing the higher value option (A0).

### Approval Decision
- Approve Contract 2.
- Do not approve Contract 1.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game Payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)
- (A0, A0): I get 5 points
- (A0, A1): I get 0 points  
- (A1, A0): I get 3 points
- (A1, A1): I get 3 points

### Step 2: Apply the Contract
The contract says:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payment

### Step 3: Calculate Modified Payoffs for Each Outcome

**Case 1: I choose A0, Player 1 chooses A0**
- Base: 5 points
- I receive +4 (for choosing A0)
- I pay -4 (Player 1 chose A0)
- **Total: 5 points**

**Case 2: I choose A0, Player 1 chooses A1**
- Base: 0 points
- I receive +4 (for choosing A0)
- I pay 0 (Player 1 chose A1)
- **Total: 4 points**

**Case 3: I choose A1, Player 1 chooses A0**
- Base: 3 points
- I receive 0 (I chose A1)
- I pay -4 (Player 1 chose A0)
- **Total: -1 points**

**Case 4: I choose A1, Player 1 chooses A1**
- Base: 3 points
- No contract payments
- **Total: 3 points**

### Step 4: Analyze My Best Strategy

My modified payoff matrix:
```
           P1 plays A0    P1 plays A1
I play A0      5              4
I play A1     -1              3
```

Comparing strategies:
- If Player 1 plays A0: I get 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → **A0 is better**
- If Player 1 plays A1: I get 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** regardless of what Player 1 does!

### Step 5: Conclusion

Since A0 gives me strictly higher payoffs in all scenarios, my optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

To maximize the total points received in this game, we must first analyze the payoff matrix as modified by the payment contract.

**Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Contract impact:**
- For every player who chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- For every player who chooses A1, no additional payment occurs.

**Applying the Contract to each scenario:**
1.  **(A0, A0):** Both choose A0. Player 1 gets +4 (for choosing A0) but also pays -4 (because Player 2 chose A0). The net additional payment is 0 for both.
    - Final Payoff: P1: 5 + 0 = 5, P2: 5 + 0 = 5
2.  **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1. Player 1 gets +4 from Player 2. 
    - Final Payoff: P1: 0 + 4 = 4, P2: 3 - 4 = -1
3.  **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0. Player 2 gets +4 from Player 1.
    - Final Payoff: P1: 3 - 4 = -1, P2: 0 + 4 = 4
4.  **(A1, A1):** Neither player chooses A0. No adjustments.
    - Final Payoff: P1: 3, P2: 3

**Final Modified Payoff Matrix:**
- **(A0, A0):** (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** (4, -1)
- **(A1, A0):** (-1, 4)
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)

**Strategic Analysis:**
- If Player 2 chooses **A0**, Player 1 receives 5 points with action A0 and -1 points with action A1. A0 is clearly better.
- If Player 2 chooses **A1**, Player 1 receives 4 points with action A0 and 3 points with action A1. A0 is still better.
Since action A0 results in a higher payoff for Player 1 regardless of what Player 2 decides, A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy**.

The same logic applies to Player 2; A0 is their strictly dominant strategy as well. The Nash Equilibrium for this game is (A0, A0), which yields 5 points for both players. Choosing any other probability distribution would only lower the expected payoff.

**Conclusion:**
Assign a 100% probability to action A0.

### Step 1: Write the original payoff matrix (Player 1)
- (A0, A0): 5  
- (A0, A1): 0  
- (A1, A0): 3  
- (A1, A1): 3  

### Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)
Rule: If you play **A1**, you **pay 4** to the other player (in a 2-player game, the entire 4 goes to the opponent).

So Player 1’s payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 0 + 4 = 4  (opponent pays 4 for playing A1)
- (A1, A0): 3 − 4 = -1 (you pay 4 for playing A1)
- (A1, A1): 3 − 4 + 4 = 3 (both pay 4 to each other, net 0)

Best responses for Player 1:
- If Player 2 plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives -1 → choose **A0**
- If Player 2 plays A1: A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3 → choose **A0**

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** under C1, leading to a unique outcome (A0, A0) with **5 points each**. This is very good for me.

✅ Approve C1.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)
Rule: If you play **A0**, you **receive 1** taken from the other player (so in 2 players: you get +1, opponent gets -1). A1 has no transfer.

Player 1’s payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 5 +1 −1 = 5
- (A0, A1): 0 +1 = 1
- (A1, A0): 3 −1 = 2
- (A1, A1): 3

Best responses for Player 1:
- If Player 2 plays A0: A0 (5) > A1 (2) → **A0**
- If Player 2 plays A1: A1 (3) > A0 (1) → **A1**

So C2 still has **two equilibria**: (A0, A0) giving 5 each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 each. That means the “bad” (A1, A1) equilibrium remains possible, unlike C1 which eliminates it.

Also, in the approval-vote stage, approving C2 could increase the chance it’s selected instead of C1 (if approvals tie), which I don’t want.

❌ Disapprove C2.

### Contract C1 (P1): Playing A1 pays 4 to the other player
Modified payoff matrix (Player1, Player2):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): base (0, 3) + transfer (+4, -4) = (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): base (3, 0) + transfer (-4, +4) = (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): base (3, 3) + transfers cancel = (3, 3)

Best responses for Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives -1 ⇒ choose A0
- If P2 plays A1: A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3 ⇒ choose A0

So A0 strictly dominates; equilibrium is (A0, A0) giving me 5.

### Contract C2 (P2): Playing A0 receives 5 from the other player
Modified payoff matrix (Player1, Player2):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) (transfers cancel)
- (A0, A1): base (0, 3) + transfer (+5, -5) = (5, -2)
- (A1, A0): base (3, 0) + transfer (-5, +5) = (-2, 5)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

Best responses for Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives -2 ⇒ choose A0
- If P2 plays A1: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives 3 ⇒ choose A0

Again A0 strictly dominates; equilibrium is (A0, A0) giving me 5.

Step 2: Approval decision
Both contracts make (A0, A0) the unique equilibrium and give me 5 points. Approving both is safe and can only help ensure some contract passes.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 4 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
Both proposed contracts change incentives so that **A0 becomes a strict dominant action** for both players, leading to the equilibrium outcome **(A0, A0)** with payoff **5** to me (same as the best coordinated outcome in the original game, but now guaranteed by incentives).

### Check Contract C1 (pay 4 if you play A1)
For me, relative to the base game:
- If I play **A1**, I pay **4** to the other player (so **–4** to me).
- If the other plays **A1**, they pay **4** to me (so **+4** to me).

Resulting payoffs for me:
- (A0,A0): 5  
- (A0,A1): 0 + 4 = 4  
- (A1,A0): 3 − 4 = −1  
- (A1,A1): 3 − 4 + 4 = 3  

So against either opponent action, **A0 gives me more than A1** ⇒ A0 strictly dominates ⇒ equilibrium (A0,A0) gives me **5**.

### Check Contract C2 (receive 4 if you play A0)
For me:
- If I play **A0**, I receive **4** from the other (so **+4** to me).
- If the other plays **A0**, I pay **4** to them (so **−4** to me).

Resulting payoffs for me:
- (A0,A0): 5 + 4 − 4 = 5  
- (A0,A1): 0 + 4 = 4  
- (A1,A0): 3 − 4 = −1  
- (A1,A1): 3  

This is strategically identical to C1: **A0 strictly dominates**, giving equilibrium (A0,A0) and payoff **5**.

### Voting implication
Since **both contracts are beneficial** (and neither is worse than the other for me), I should **approve both** to maximize the chance some contract is adopted.

response:
Under each contract, the “A1 payment” is a transfer: if **I** play A1 I **pay** \(t\) to the other player; if the **other** plays A1, I **receive** \(t\).

### Contract C1 (A1 pays 4)
My payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): \(5\)
- (A0, A1): \(0 + 4 = 4\)
- (A1, A0): \(3 - 4 = -1\)
- (A1, A1): \(3 - 4 + 4 = 3\)

So:
- If the other plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives -1 → choose A0
- If the other plays A1: A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3 → choose A0

**A0 strictly dominates A1**, so the unique outcome is (A0, A0) with payoff 5 for me. This is very good.

### Contract C2 (A1 pays 1)
My payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): \(5\)
- (A0, A1): \(0 + 1 = 1\)
- (A1, A0): \(3 - 1 = 2\)
- (A1, A1): \(3\)

Best responses are unchanged in structure (still coordination): (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) remain equilibria, so this contract doesn’t reliably force the best outcome.

### Approval choice
To maximize the chance the strong contract (C1) wins, I should **approve C1 only**. Approving C2 can only help C2 win in ties/close votes, which risks selecting the weaker contract.

Step 1: Compute how each contract changes my payoffs (2 players, so “distributed equally among the other players” means paid entirely to the other player).

### Contract C1 (A1 pays 4 to the other player)
My payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 5  
- (A0, A1): base 0 + receive 4 = 4  
- (A1, A0): base 3 − pay 4 = -1  
- (A1, A1): base 3 − 4 + 4 = 3  

So under C1, **A0 strictly dominates A1** for me (5 > -1 if other plays A0; 4 > 3 if other plays A1). This pushes play to (A0, A0) with payoff **5** for me.

### Contract C2 (A0 gets +1 from other; A1 pays 2 to other)
My payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 5 (the +1 transfers cancel out)  
- (A0, A1): base 0 + (1 + 2) = 3  
- (A1, A0): base 3 − (2 + 1) = 0  
- (A1, A1): 3 (the −2 transfers cancel out)

Under C2, **A0 weakly dominates A1**, but (A1, A1) can still be an equilibrium outcome, giving me only **3**.

Step 2: Voting/selection logic
If I approve both C1 and C2, and Player 2 approves only C2, then **C2 wins outright** (2 approvals vs 1), exposing me to a worse possible outcome than C1. Approving only C1 avoids that risk and still ensures C1 is selected whenever it can be.

**Approvals:**

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)**

This is a simultaneous-move game with two players and two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2, with Player 2 being you):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P2: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

So, in the base game:
- If both choose A0 → (5, 5)
- If P2 chooses A0, P1 chooses A1 → (0, 3)
- If P2 chooses A1, P1 chooses A0 → (3, 0)
- If both choose A1 → (3, 3)

We are analyzing from the perspective of **Player 2**.

Let’s look for Nash equilibria in the base game.

#### Best responses:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2’s payoff: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → best response: A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2’s payoff: A0 → 0, A1 → 3 → best response: A1

So P2’s best response depends on P1’s action.

Now from P1’s perspective:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best response: A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best response: A1

So:
- (A0, A0) → mutual best response → Nash equilibrium.
- (A1, A1) → mutual best response → Nash equilibrium.

There are **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

Also, there may be a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, but we’ll come back to that.

But notice: (A0, A0) gives both players 5 — the highest possible total payoff (10), while (A1, A1) gives 3 each (total 6). So (A0, A0) is Pareto superior.

However, there's a problem: if you deviate from A0 when the other plays A0, you only get 3 vs 5 → so you'd rather stick with A0. But if you think the other will play A1, you'd prefer A1.

So coordination is fragile.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract proposed by Player 2 (you) is:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player(s).
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:
- Choosing A0 gives you **+2 points**, but this 2 points is **taken from the other player** (i.e., it’s a transfer from the other player to you).
- Choosing A1 → no change.

So the **net effect is that A0 is now more valuable** to you when you play it, but it **costs the other player 2 points** if you choose A0.

Let’s rewrite the payoff matrix **with the contract in effect**, assuming both players sign it (which we are deciding whether to do).

Note: The contract only takes effect **if both sign**. So, we must consider whether signing it is beneficial *assuming the other player also signs*, because otherwise the contract doesn’t apply.

So let’s consider the **contracted game** — both players sign, so the contract is active.

Now, the payoffs become:

- If you choose A0, you get **+2** points from the contract → added to your base payoff.
- The other player gets **-2** points (since the 2 is drawn from them).

So let's rewrite the payoff matrix with the contract applied (both players sign):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (5+2, 5-2) = (7, 3) | (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1) |
| **P2: A1** | (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2) | (3, 3) |

Wait — careful: the 2 points are "drawn equally from the other players" — since there is only one other player, the full 2 points are taken from the opponent if you choose A0.

That makes sense.

So yes:
- When you play A0 and P1 plays A0 → you get 5 + 2 = 7, P1 gets 5 - 2 = 3
- You play A0, P1 plays A1 → you get 0 + 2 = 2, P1 gets 3 - 2 = 1
- You play A1, P1 plays A0 → you get 3 - 2 = 1, P1 gets 0 + 2 = 2
- Both play A1 → no contract effect → (3, 3)

So the new payoff matrix (Player 2 is you):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (7, 3) | (2, 1) |
| **P2: A1** | (1, 2) | (3, 3) |

Now let’s analyze this new game.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the contracted game**

We are Player 2. We want to maximize our own expected payoff **under the assumption that the other player will also sign and play optimally** (since the contract is only active if both sign — so we must assume both sign for it to apply).

So let’s look for equilibria in this new game.

#### Best responses:

**For Player 2 (you):**
- If P1 plays A0: 
  - Your payoff: A0 → 7, A1 → 1 → best response: A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - A0 → 2, A1 → 3 → best response: A1

**For Player 1:**
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1: A0 → 3, A1 → 1 → best response: A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1: A0 → 2, A1 → 3 → best response: A1

So:
- (A0, A0): P2 wants A0 if P1 plays A0 → yes. P1 wants A0 if P2 plays A0 → yes → **Nash equilibrium**
- (A1, A1): P2 wants A1 if P1 plays A1 → yes. P1 wants A1 if P2 plays A1 → yes → **Nash equilibrium**

So two pure NE again: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But now in (A0,A0), you get 7 points → **better** than before (used to get 5)
In (A1,A1), you get 3 points → same as before.

So the **most favorable outcome for you is (A0,A0)** — you get 7.

But is there a **strict incentive to play A0**? Yes — if the other player is playing A0, you prefer A0 (7 > 1). If they are playing A1, you prefer A1 (3 > 2).

So now, is it better to play A0 or A1? It depends on expectations.

But notice: in the (A0,A0) equilibrium, you get 7 → great.
But to get there, you must coordinate on A0.

Now, consider what happens if you **don’t sign the contract**.

Then the contract doesn’t apply — we are back to the base game.

In the base game, if both play A0 → you get 5.
But in the contracted game, if both play A0 → you get 7.

So **if both players can coordinate on A0**, you benefit greatly from signing the contract.

But if there’s a risk of miscoordination, the contract might hurt you.

Let’s evaluate whether the contract makes it easier or harder to coordinate on A0.

---

### **Step 4: Check incentives and coordination**

In the base game:
- (A0, A0) is a NE: both earn 5
- (A1, A1) is a NE: both earn 3
- But (A0,A0) is better for both — so it’s a Pareto-dominant equilibrium.

However, if players are uncertain, they might fear that the other will play A1, so they might choose A1 to avoid getting 0.

But in the **contracted game**, let’s look at the payoffs again:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (7, 3) | (2, 1) |
| **P2: A1** | (1, 2) | (3, 3) |

Now, if you play A0, you get:
- 7 if P1 plays A0
- 2 if P1 plays A1

If you play A1:
- 1 if P1 plays A0
- 3 if P1 plays A1

So you are better off playing A0 only if P1 is likely to play A0 — but if you think P1 might play A1, then A1 gives 3 > 2.

But notice: **if both players are rational and understand the game, they might coordinate on (A0,A0)**.

In fact, **(A0,A0)** is still a NE, and now it’s **strictly better** for you than (A1,A1).

Moreover, **the contract makes A0 more attractive** even for risk-averse players.

Suppose we consider a mixed strategy equilibrium.

But let’s think differently: **What if Player 2 (you) signs the contract, but Player 1 does not?**

Then the contract **does not activate**, because it requires both players to sign.

So if you sign but the other doesn’t → no contract → you play the base game.

But if you **don’t sign**, then even if the other signs, no contract → base game.

So the contract only matters if **both** sign.

Therefore, your decision affects whether the contract is active.

Now, your goal: **maximize your total points**.

So you must ask: **Will signing the contract, under the condition that the other player may or may not sign, lead to a higher expected payoff than not signing?**

But the problem says: **"you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract."**

And the contract becomes active **only if all players sign it**.

So we are to **decide unilaterally** whether to sign, **assumed that the other player will also sign**? Or do we have to worry about whether they will?

Wait — the setup says: *"The contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)"*

So the contract is already **proposed by you**, and **approved via approval voting** — presumably the other player had a chance to vote.

But we are being told: *"you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract"*

So we are now deciding whether to **sign it**, but the contract only applies if both sign.

So unless you sign, it won’t apply — **even if the other player votes yes**.

The key is: **You cannot enforce the contract.** It’s only active if both sign.

So your decision is: **Should I sign it, assuming the other player will also sign**?

Or should I only sign if it benefits me even if I expect the other to sign?

Let’s suppose: **you believe the other player will sign** — because it’s a vote, and they might have approved.

But we need to consider: **if both sign, what is your expected payoff?**

Since both sign → contract active.

Then play the new game.

In that new game, there are two Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

Which one will they play?

Well, **(A0,A0) is better for both** — you get 7 vs 3, and they get 3 vs 2. But the other player gets 3 in (A0,A0) vs 3 in (A1,A1)? Wait — in (A1,A1), they get 3 — same as in (A0,A0)?

Let’s check:

- If both play A0: you get 7, other gets 3
- If both play A1: you get 3, other gets 3

So **you benefit from (A0,A0)** (7 vs 3), but **the other player is indifferent** between (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) — they get 3 in both.

So **you have an incentive to coordinate on A0**, and the other player has no incentive to deviate — they get same payoff either way.

But if both are rational and value coordination, and know this, **they might coordinate on (A0,A0)** — since you are the only one who benefits.

But wait — the other player gets 3 in both, but if they play A0 when you play A0 → they get 3.

If they play A1 when you play A1 → they also get 3.

But if the other player plays A1 and you play A0 → they get 1.

So they **prefer A0** when you play A0 — so they are happy to play A0 if you do.

In fact, **the other player has no reason to avoid A0**.

So **(A0,A0)** is a stable equilibrium.

Moreover, since you get 7 there, and 3 in (A1,A1), and the other player is indifferent, it is **in their interest to play A0** if they think you will, since it avoids the risk of getting only 1.

But actually — **even if they're indifferent**, they have **no downside** to playing A0.

So likely, **if you sign the contract, and they believe you will cooperate**, they will play A0.

In fact, the **only outcome where you get more than 3** is (A0,A0).

So let’s assume: **if both sign the contract, the players coordinate on A0**, achieving the outcome (7,3).

Then, your payoff is **7**.

Now, what if you **do not sign** the contract?

Then, the contract is inactive → game is base game.

In the base game, outcomes:
- (A0,A0): you get 5
- (A1,A1): you get 3

So maximum you can get is 5.

But can you get 5? Only if you coordinate on (A0,A0).

Is that likely?

In the base game, (A0,A0) is a NE, so yes — but risk of miscoordination.

But in the **contracted game**, **you get 7** under (A0,A0), which is **much higher than 5**.

Moreover, the contract **incentivizes A0** — because choosing A0 gives you a 2-point bonus.

So in **both cases**, (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium, and **more attractive** under the contract.

Also, in the contracted game, **your payoff if you play A0 is 7** when the other plays A0, and 2 when they play A1.

In base game, if you play A0, you get 5 or 0.

So even if the other player plays A1, you get 2 (contracted) vs 0 (base) — so **you are better off no matter what**, **as long as the contract exists**.

But the key is: **the contract only exists if both sign.**

So:

- If you sign, and the other signs → contract active → you can expect to get **7** (if coordination on A0 happens)
- If you don’t sign → contract inactive → you get at most 5, possibly less (e.g., if miscoordination)

But even if you **do not sign**, the other player **might** still sign — but **then no contract** → game is base game.

So your payoff depends on whether you sign and whether the other does.

But the problem is asking: **Should you sign the contract?**

We must assume that the **other player is rational and will also sign** if it benefits them.

Let’s check: **Does it benefit the other player to sign the contract?**

The contract says:
- If you choose A0 → you get +2, they get -2
- If you choose A1 → no change

So for the other player (Player 1), when they **sign**, their payoffs become:

| P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|--------|--------|
| P1: A0 → pay 2 → gets 5 - 2 = 3 → but wait: when P2 plays A0, **P1 loses 2** → so if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 3
| P1: A1 → gets 3
| P1: A0, P2: A1 → P1 gets 0 + 2 = 2? No!

Wait: **The contract says**: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So **who gets the 2 points?** The player who chooses A0.

And it says **drawn equally from the other players** — so if there is only one other player, the full 2 points are taken from them.

So, if **P1 chooses A0**, they get +2, and **P2 gets -2**.

Similarly, if **P2 chooses A0**, P2 gets +2, P1 gets -2.

So yes.

So for the **other player (P1)**, their payoff matrix when the contract is active:

| P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|--------|--------|
| A0 → 5 - 2 = 3 | A0 → 0 + 2 = 2 |
| A1 → 3 | A1 → 3 |

Wait no:

- If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 5, but **since they chose A0**, they get +2 → so 5 + 2 = 7? No — **the rule is: the player who chooses A0 gets +2**.

But the “drawn from the other players” — so **the +2 comes from the other player**.

So **if P1 chooses A0**, regardless of what P2 does, P1 receives 2 extra points **from P2**.

Similarly, **if P2 chooses A0**, P2 gets 2 extra from P1.

So in fact, **each time a player plays A0, they get +2, and the other player loses 2**.

So the payoff depends on **both actions**.

So if both play A0: 
- P1: base 5 + 2 (for playing A0) = 7, and P2 loses 2 → but P2 also gets +2 for playing A0 → so P2: 5 + 2 = 7, and P1 loses 2 → 5 - 2 = 3.

Yes — consistent.

So **P1’s payoff when contract is active**:
- P2: A0, P1: A0 → 5 + 2 = 7, but they lose 2 to P2 → so 5 + 2 - 2 = 5?
No — confusion.

The rule is: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So the **additional 2 points are added to their payoff**, and **subtracted from the other player**.

So:
- P1 plays A0 → gets +2
- P2 plays A0 → gets +2

But if **both play A0**:
- P1 gets base 5 + 2 (for their own A0) - 2 (because P2 played A0, so P1 loses 2) → net: 5
- P2 gets base 5 + 2 (for A0) - 2 (because P1 played A0) → net: 5

Wait — that’s not right.

No: the **2 points are drawn from the other player(s)** **only when the player chooses A0**.

So if **P1 chooses A0**, **they get +2**, and this 2 is taken from **P2**.

Similarly, if **P2 chooses A0**, they get +2, taken from **P1**.

So if **both choose A0**:
- P1: gets base 5 (from (A0,A0)) + 2 (for choosing A0) - 2 (because P2 chose A0) = 5 + 2 - 2 = 5
- P2: gets base 5 + 2 - 2 = 5

Wait — but that contradicts earlier.

But that can’t be right — the contract says "drawn equally from the other players" — so if P2 chooses A0, they take 2 from P1 → so P1 loses 2.

Similarly, P1 chooses A0 → takes 2 from P2.

So if both choose A0:
- P1 gets: base 5 + 2 (from their own A0) - 2 (from P2's A0) → 5
- P2 gets: base 5 + 2 - 2 → 5

Similarly, if both choose A1:
- no transfers → 3, 3

If P1: A0, P2: A1:
- P1: base 3 (from A0,A1) + 2 (for A0) - 0 = 5
- P2: base 0 + 0 (no A0) - 2 (from P1's A0)? No — wait, P2 didn't choose A0, so P1 doesn't take from them for their own action.

No — the transfer is: **when a player chooses A0, they take 2 from the other player(s)**.

So:
- P1 chooses A0 → they gain 2, P2 loses 2
- P2 chooses A0 → they gain 2, P1 loses 2

So if P1: A0, P2: A1:
- P1: base 3 + 2 = 5
- P2: base 0 (from A1,A0) + 0 (no A0) = 0, but does P1’s A0 take from P2? Yes — because P1 chose A0 → takes 2 from P2 → so P2 loses 2.

Wait — but P2 didn't choose A0, but they lose 2 because P1 chose A0.

Yes — the contract is: **if you choose A0, you get +2, drawn from others**.

So the **other player(s) lose 2 per A0 choice by the other**.

So in P1: A0, P2: A1:
- P1: base 3 + 2 = 5 (plus bonus for choosing A0)
- P2: base 0 + 0 (no bonus) - 2 (because P1 chose A0) = -2

But that can’t be right — in the matrix earlier we had P2: A1, P1: A0 → in base game 3 points for P1, 0 for P2 — but now P2 gets -2?

But in our initial interpretation, we had P2: A1, P1: A0 → (3,0), and with contract, P2 gets 0 - 2 = -2, P1 gets 3 + 2 = 5.

But earlier I said for P2: A1, P1: A0 → (3-2, 0+2) = (1,2), which was wrong.

I made a mistake.

Let’s fix this.

The contract is: 
- When a player chooses A0, they get +2, and the other player loses 2.

So the net effect:
- If both choose A0: 
  - P1: base 5 + 2 (from their A0) - 2 (from P2's A0) = 5
  - P2: base 5 + 2 - 2 = 5
- If P1: A0, P2: A1:
  - P1: base 3 + 2 = 5 (bonus for A0)
  - P2: base 0 + 0 - 2 = -2 (loss from P1's A0)
- If P1: A1, P2: A0:
  - P1: base 0 + 0 - 2 = -2 (loss from P2's A0)
  - P2: base 3 + 2 = 5 (bonus for A0)
- If both A1: 
  - P1: 3, P2: 3

So the correct matrix with contract active is:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (5, 5) | (5, -2) |
| **P2: A1** | (-2, 5) | (3, 3) |

This is completely different!

Now, let’s see what happens.

**You are P2.**

- If you play A0 and P1 plays A0: you get 5
- You play A0, P1 plays A1: you get -2
- You play A1, P1 plays A0: you get 5
- You play A1, P1 plays A1: you get 3

So your best responses:
- If P1 plays A0: you get 5 (A0) vs 5 (A1) → indifferent
- If P1 plays A1: you get -2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best to play A1

But there’s a problem: **you can lose 2 points if you choose A0 and the other chooses A1**.

Now, is (A0,A0) a NE? Yes: you get 5, and if you deviate to A1, you get 5 — same. Similarly for P1.

(A1,A1): you get 3; if you deviate to A0, you get -2 — worse. So yes, it's a NE.

But now, (A0,A0) gives you 5, which is **less than the base game’s (A0,A0) payoff of 5**.

In base game, you got 5.

Here, also 5.

But in base game, you never got less than 0.

Here, you could get -2.

And you get only 3 in (A1,A1).

But in base game, (A1,A1) gives 3, same as here.

But in base game, (A0,A0) gives 5, here also 5.

But here, you bear the risk of getting -2.

Moreover, the other player:
- If they play A0, they get +2 from P2's choice, but lose 2 if P2 plays A0.
- In fact, their payoff depends.

Let’s see if there’s an incentive to play A0.

For P1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) or 5 (A1) → indifferent
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets -2 (A0) or 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So P1 will not play A0 unless they believe P2 will play A0.

But if both play A0, you get 5.

But in base game, you also get 5 for (A0,A0), and no risk.

But here, you have risk: if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get -2.

But in the base game, if you play A0 and other plays A1, you get 0.

So you are now worse off in that case.

Therefore, **the contract makes it worse for you** when you play A0 and the other plays A1.

And in both games, you can get 3 in (A1,A1), but in the contracted game, (A0,A0) is still available with 5.

But is it safe?

Now, suppose you sign the contract.

Then if the other player also signs, you play the new game.

In this new game, you can get:
- 5 if both play A0
- 3 if both play A1
- -2 if you play A0 and other plays A1
- 5 if you play A1 and other plays A0

So you have to coordinate on (A0,A0) to get 5, otherwise you risk -2.

But in the **base game**, you get:
- 5 if both A0
- 3 if both A1
- 0 if you A0, other A1
- 3 if you A1, other A0

So in the base game, your minimum is 3 (when you play A1), but in the contracted game, you can get -2.

So the contract introduces **a new risk**: getting -2 in a bad coordination.

Moreover, the other player might not want to play A0 because if they play A0 and you play A1, they get -2.

So both players have incentive to avoid A0 if they think the other might play A1.

Therefore, **the contract may induce miscoordination**.

But in both games, (A0,A0) is a NE, but with the contract, it’s not strictly better.

In fact, in the contracted game, you can get -2, which is worse than the base game's 0.

 So signing the contract **exposes you to a new risk of getting a very bad payoff (-2) that you didn't have before**.

Therefore, it is **not beneficial** to sign the contract, because:
- You never get a higher payoff than in the base game (max is 5 in both)
- You can get -2, which is worse than the 0 you can get in the base game
- The other player may not want to play A0, so you might end up with -2

And since you are rational, you should avoid a risk that doesn't give you any advantage.

Therefore, you should **not sign the contract**.

Final reasoning:

- If you sign, and the other signs, you play a game where you risk getting -2.
- In the base game, even in the worst case (you play A0, other plays A1), you get 0.
- Here, you can get -2.
- You get the same best case (5) as in the base game.
- No additional benefit.

Therefore, signing the contract is **harmful** due to increased risk.

So you should reject it.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.

response:
To determine whether signing the contract is beneficial for me, I need to analyze the payoffs both with and without the contract.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

**1. Original Game Payoffs:**
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: I get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: I get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: I get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: I get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

**2. Payoffs with the Contract:** 
- Choosing A0 gives an additional 1 point and takes away 1 point from the other player.
- Choosing A1 costs 2 additional points and gives 2 additional points to the other player.

Here’s how the points and payments adjust each scenario:

   Without Contract:
    - (A0, A0): (5, 5)
    - (A0, A1): (0, 3)
    - (A1, A0): (3, 0)
    - (A1, A1): (3, 3)

   With Contract:
    - (A0, A0):
        * I get 5 + 1 = 6, Other player gets 5 - 1 = 4
    - (A0, A1):
        * I get 0 + 1 = 1, Other player gets 3 - 1 = 2
    - (A1, A0):
        * I get 3 - 2 = 1, Other player gets 0 + 2 = 2
    - (A1, A1):
        * I get 3 - 2 = 1, Other player gets 3 - 2 = 1

**3. Summarizing the Adjusted Payoffs:**
   With Contract:
    - (A0, A0): (6, 4)
    - (A0, A1): (1, 2)
    - (A1, A0): (1, 2)
    - (A1, A1): (1, 1)

**4. Analysis of the Strategically Optimal Choice:**
   For me as Player 2, advantages are:
    - If both players sign the contract, choosing A0 results in higher points compared to choosing A1 in any scenario.
    - Hence, mutual cooperation on A0 seems more beneficial, yielding (6, 4) compared to any other combination which results in my points being less than 6.

**5. Conclusion:**
   Signing the contract will likely lead to more cooperation toward (A0, A0) because it offers more points to both players than any other strategy combination.

Since signing the contract increases the payoff significantly if both players choose A0, and it is likely to encourage cooperation towards better outcomes:

response:
To decide which contracts to approve, I compare how each contract changes the *actual* payoff matrix (base payoff ± contract transfers), then infer what actions will be chosen in the resulting game.

## 1) Baseline (no contract) intuition
The original game has two coordination equilibria \((A0,A0)\) and \((A1,A1)\). So without any contract there’s some risk of ending up at the lower-payoff outcome \((A1,A1)\).

## 2) Evaluate Contract C1 (Player 1’s proposal)
Rule: playing **A1** makes you **pay 4** to the other player.

Resulting payoffs for **Player 2**:

- \((A0,A0)\): \(5\)
- \((A0,A1)\): \(3 - 4 = -1\)
- \((A1,A0)\): \(0 + 4 = 4\)
- \((A1,A1)\): \(3\) (both pay 4 and receive 4, net 0)

Best response check for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays **A0**: \(A0\) gives 5 vs \(A1\) gives -1 ⇒ choose **A0**
- If Player 1 plays **A1**: \(A0\) gives 4 vs \(A1\) gives 3 ⇒ choose **A0**

So under C1, **A0 is a dominant action** (for both players by symmetry), yielding the unique equilibrium \((A0,A0)\) with payoff **5** to me.

## 3) Evaluate Contract C2 (Player 2’s proposal)
Rule: playing **A0** makes you **receive 4** from the other player.

Compute payoffs (they end up the same as C1 in every action profile):

- \((A0,A0)\): \(5\) (each pays 4 and receives 4, net 0)
- \((A0,A1)\): \(3 - 4 = -1\)
- \((A1,A0)\): \(0 + 4 = 4\)
- \((A1,A1)\): \(3\)

Same dominance logic: **A0 is dominant**, unique equilibrium \((A0,A0)\), payoff **5** to me.

## 4) Voting implication
Since **C1 and C2 induce identical incentives and identical payoffs**, I’m indifferent between them. Approving both cannot hurt me and keeps either contract eligible to be selected.

{"C1": true, "C2": true}

response:
To optimize the decision-making process in this game, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding Payoff Matrix Including Contract
We start by understanding the original payoffs and then incorporate the contract adjustments into these payoffs:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Raw Payoff to You | Contract Adjusted Payoff to You | Raw Payoff to Other Player | Contract Adjusted Payoff to Other Player |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5                 | 5+1=6                        | 5                          | 5-1=4                               |
| A0          | A1                     | 0                 | 0+1=1                        | 3                          | 3-1=2                               |
| A1          | A0                     | 3                 | 3-2=1                        | 0                          | 0+2=2                               |
| A1          | A1                     | 3                 | 3-2=1                        | 3                          | 3+2=5                               |

- If both choose A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 4 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 1 point, the other player gets 2 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 1 point, the other player gets 2 points.
- If both choose A1: You get 1 point, the other player gets 5 points.

### Step 2: Analyzing Dominant Strategies
We analyze if there's a dominant strategy once the contract adjustments are considered:

Considering just raw strategy:
- A0 always gives you more points directly.
But with contract adjustments:
- If the other player chooses A0, A0 gives you 6 points (instead of 1 with A1).
- If the other player chooses A1, A0 gives you 1 point (same as 1 with A1, but you aren't penalizing).

Pure dominance doesn't appear clear-cut with contract impacts. So we consider the expected payoffs. Given that simplicity is often prioritized in structured games like these, assuming rational behavior and players looking to maximize their points.

### Step 3: Optimal Mixed Strategy
Given the dominant payoff to stick with A0 when considering both raw and contract adjusted payoffs, it’s smarter for Player 2 to use A0 predominantly. However, some small probability for A1 isn’t bad for complexity's sake and unpredictability:

### Final Decision
Put a high percentage on A0 and a small, non-zero percentage on A1 to cover any mixed strategy and variance possibilities:
```json
{"A0": 90, "A1": 10}
```
This distribution reflects the strategy to heavily favor the higher yielding option (A0) but also occasionally mix in A1 for uncertainty and hedging against pure strategy locks.

Let's analyze this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are playing a simultaneous move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (as Player 2, so rows are my actions, columns are the other player's actions):

|          | Other Player: A0 | Other Player: A1 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **You: A0** | 5, 5             | 0, 3             |
| **You: A1** | 3, 0             | 3, 3             |

Let’s find the Nash equilibria.

#### Pure Strategy Equilibria:
- (A0, A0): You get 5, other gets 5.
   - If you deviate to A1: get 3 < 5 → no incentive.
   - If other deviates to A1: gets 3 < 5 → no incentive.
   → **Nash equilibrium**

- (A1, A1): You get 3, other gets 3.
   - If you deviate to A0: get 0 < 3 → no incentive.
   - If other deviates to A0: gets 0 < 3 → no incentive.
   → **Nash equilibrium**

- (A0, A1): You get 0, other gets 3.
   - You want to deviate to A1 → get 3 > 0 → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): You get 3, other gets 0.
   - Other wants to deviate to A1 → get 3 > 0 → not equilibrium.

So pure equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

#### Mixed Strategy Equilibrium?

Let’s suppose Player 1 (the other player) plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p).  
You (Player 2) want to mix.

Your expected payoff from A0:  
5p + 0(1-p) = 5p

Your expected payoff from A1:  
3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal for indifference:  
5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So if other plays A0 with 0.6, you are indifferent.

Now, suppose you play A0 with probability q, A1 with (1-q).  
Other's payoff from A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q  
Other's payoff from A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 0.6

So mixed strategy equilibrium: both play A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

But the question is not about strategy selection — it’s about **approving a contract**, given that the winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

Each contract modifies the payoffs via external payments **drawn equally from the other player**.

#### Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0 → +4 points, **drawn equally from the other player**
- A1 → no additional payment

So:
- When you play A0: you gain +4, and the other player loses 4 (since payment is drawn from them).
- When you play A1: no change.

So the **net effect** on your payoff depends on what action you play.

Let’s compute **new payoff matrix** under C1:

|          | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| You: A0  | 5+4 = 9, 5–4 = 1 | 0+4 = 4, 3–4 = –1 |
| You: A1  | 3–4 = –1, 0+4 = 4 | 3, 3 |

Wait: **"drawn equally from the other players"** — what does that mean?

Let’s parse carefully:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So, if *you* play A0, you get +4, and **the other player loses 4**, since the payment is drawn from them.

So the **net transfer** is -4 for the other player, +4 for you.

So the new payoffs (Player 2 = you):

|          | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| You: A0  | 5 + 4 = 9 | 0 + 4 = 4 |
| You: A1  | 3 – 4 = –1 | 3         |

And the other player's payoffs (reverse, minus 4 if they chose A0):

|          | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| You: A0  | 5 – 4 = 1 | 3 – 4 = –1 |
| You: A1  | 0 + 4 = 4 | 3         |

But we only care about **your** payoff, because you are maximizing **your total points**.

So your new payoffs under C1:

- (A0, A0): 9
- (A0, A1): 4
- (A1, A0): –1
- (A1, A1): 3

So your payoff is higher when you play A0, especially vs A0.

Now, **what would you do?**

Let’s find best response.

Suppose other plays A0 with p.

Your payoff:
- A0: 9p + 4(1-p) = 9p + 4 – 4p = 5p + 4
- A1: (–1)p + 3(1–p) = –p + 3 – 3p = 3 – 4p

Set equal: 5p + 4 = 3 – 4p → 9p = –1 → p = –1/9 → not possible.

Since 5p + 4 > 3 – 4p for all p ≥ 0, because even at p=0: left=4, right=3 → 4>3.

So A0 always better than A1 → you will **always** play A0, regardless.

So under C1, **you will play A0 with probability 1**.

Then the other player, seeing this, will best respond.

The other player’s payoff in full (including contract):

- If they play A0: gets 1 if you play A0 → payoff 1
- If they play A1: gets –1 if you play A0 → payoff –1

So they will play A0 → so outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 9 points.

You get **9 points** under C1 (if both follow best responses).

But **you are the one deciding whether to approve**.

You get **9 points** if C1 passes and you both act optimally.

Now, **what about C2 (proposed by Player 2)**?

C2:
- If a player chooses A0 → +2 points, drawn equally from other player
- A1 → no change

So same logic.

Your payoff under C2:

|          | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| You: A0  | 5+2 = 7 | 0+2 = 2 |
| You: A1  | 3–2 = 1 | 3         |

So your payoffs:
- A0: 7 if other A0, 2 if other A1
- A1: 1 if other A0, 3 if other A1

Best response?

Suppose other plays A0 with p.

Your A0: 7p + 2(1–p) = 7p + 2 – 2p = 5p + 2  
Your A1: 1p + 3(1–p) = p + 3 – 3p = 3 – 2p

Set equal: 5p + 2 = 3 – 2p → 7p = 1 → p = 1/7 ≈ 0.1429

For p < 1/7: A0 is better (since 5p + 2 > 3 – 2p)
For p > 1/7: A1 better

Now, suppose you play A0 with q.

Other player’s payoff:
- A0: 5 – 2 = 3 if you play A0 (because you get +2, other loses 2), or 0 if you play A1 → so: 3q + 0(1–q) = 3q
- A1: 3q + 3(1–q) = 3

So other player will play A0 if 3q > 3 → q > 1 → impossible. So they prefer A1 unless q = 1.

Wait: A0 → 3q, A1 → 3

So:
- If q = 1, A0: 3, A1: 3 → indifferent
- If q < 1, A0: < 3 → A1 better

So if you play A0 with q < 1, other will play A1.

But you will respond.

So let’s find **Nash equilibrium in C2**.

Suppose you play A0 with q.

Then other’s best response:
- A0: gets 3q
- A1: gets 3
- So:
   - if q < 1 → 3q < 3 → other plays A1
   - if q = 1 → indifferent → could play A0 or A1

Suppose other plays A1 (if q < 1). Then your payoff:
- A0: 2
- A1: 3
→ so you prefer A1

But if you play A1, then q = 0 → other plays A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → you get 3 points

Wait, but if you play A0 with q close to 1, say q=1, then other is indifferent → could play A0 or A1.

But you: if other plays A0, your A0 gives 7, A1 gives 1 → so you prefer A0

So if other plays A0, you play A0

But other: if you play A0, other gets 3 from A0, 3 from A1 → indifferent.

So possible equilibrium: you play A0 with q=1, other plays A0 with p=1 → (A0, A0)

Check if best response:
- You: A0 gives 7, A1 gives 1 → yes
- Other: A0 gives 3, A1 gives 3 → indifferent, so can play A0

So (A0, A0) is an equilibrium.

But is (A1, A1) also?

You: A0 gives 2 (if opponent A1), A1 gives 3 → so if other plays A1, you prefer A1 → so you play A1

Other: if you play A1, other: A1 gives 3, A0 gives 0 → so plays A1

So (A1, A1) → you get 3

Now, what about mixed?

Suppose other plays A1 (since if q<1, they prefer A1), then you play A1 → so q=1 → contradiction.

So only possible equilibrium in pure strategies:
- (A0, A0): you get 7
- (A1, A1): you get 3

Now, could there be mixed?

Suppose other plays A0 with p.

Your best response:
- A0: 5p + 2
- A1: 3 – 2p

Set equal: 5p + 2 = 3 – 2p → 7p = 1 → p = 1/7

So for p = 1/7, you're indifferent.

Now, what does other do?

You play A0 with q.

Other’s payoff:
- A0: 3q (since you get +2, other loses 2 → other gets 5–2=3 if you play A0, 0 if you play A1)
- A1: 3

So other plays A0 if 3q > 3 → q > 1 → impossible → so only if q=1, then 3q=3 → indifferent.

So if q=1, other is indifferent → can play p=1/7

Then you are indifferent → so you could play q=1

So (q=1, p=1/7) → not a best response for other: if you play q=1, other is **indifferent**, so p=1/7 is okay.

But then you, facing p=1/7, are indifferent → so q=1 is a best response.

So this is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium: you play A0 with probability 1, other plays A0 with probability 1/7.

Then your expected payoff:
- A0: 7*(1/7) + 2*(6/7) = 1 + 12/7 = 19/7 ≈ 2.714
- But since you play A0 with q=1, your expected payoff is 7*(1/7) + 2*(6/7) = 1 + 12/7 ≈ 2.714

But earlier we said (A0, A0) gives 7, which is better.

In fact, under C2, **the game has multiple equilibria**, and you can **choose to play A0 with probability 1**, and if others do the same, you get 7.

But would others? The contract is **only effective if both parties approve** — but the voting is for **approval**, and the winning contract is selected **only among those with maximum number of approvals**.

But you are trying to **maximize your final points**, which depend on **which contract gets chosen**, and how players behave after.

Let’s think about **your incentives**.

You are rational, self-interested.

You want to **maximize your expected points**.

You can’t unilaterally control the outcome — only your approval matters, and then the contract is chosen **at random among those most approved**, so you want to approve contracts that **benefit you**, and also, to **maximize the chance of a good contract being selected**, you want to maximize approvals of good ones.

But also, **if multiple contracts have the same number of approvals (maximum)**, then one is picked uniformly at random.

So your goal is not just to approve good contracts, but also to **cooperate in approving contracts that you like**, to make it more likely that a good one gets chosen.

But **in this setup, you are the only one you can influence directly** — you can approve or not.

But the question is: **which contracts should you approve, to maximize your expected points**?

---

### **Step 3: Compare Contracts from Your Perspective (Player 2)**

Let’s list the **maximum points you can get under each contract**, assuming players act optimally.

#### Under C1 (Player 1’s contract):
- Your payoff matrix after contract:
  - (A0, A0): 9
  - (A0, A1): 4
  - (A1, A0): –1
  - (A1, A1): 3

As shown earlier, **you always prefer A0** regardless of opponent.

So you will play A0.

Then, opponent: if you play A0, they get:
- A0: 1 (5–4)
- A1: –1 (3–4)

So they will play A0.

So equilibrium: (A0, A0) → you get **9 points**

So **max possible under C1: 9**

#### Under C2 (Player 2’s own contract):
- Your payoff:
  - (A0, A0): 7
  - (A0, A1): 2
  - (A1, A0): 1
  - (A1, A1): 3

As analyzed, you can get **7** from (A0, A0), or **3** from (A1, A1)

Now, can you coordinate on (A0, A0)?

Yes — if both play A0, you get 7, which is better than 3.

But: **would the other player** want to play A0?

Other player’s payoff under C2:
- (A0, A0): 5 – 2 = 3
- (A0, A1): 3 – 2 = 1
- (A1, A0): 0 + 2 = 2
- (A1, A1): 3

So other player’s payoffs:
- If they play A0: get 3 if you play A0, 2 if you play A1
- If they play A1: get 1 if you play A0, 3 if you play A1

So their best response:
- If you play A0, they prefer A0 (3 > 2)
- If you play A1, they prefer A1 (3 > 1)

So (A0, A0) is an equilibrium for them.

So (A0, A0) is a mutual best response.

Therefore, under C2, if both players believe this, they can coordinate on (A0, A0), giving you **7 points**

Is there a risk of coordination failure? Possibly, but since both have incentive, and (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium, we assume it is played.

So you get **7 points under C2**

But note: **you proposed C2** — but that’s irrelevant.

Now, compare:

- C1: you get **9 points**
- C2: you get **7 points**

So **C1 is better for you than C2**

But wait — **you can only approve contracts**.

If you approve **C1**, and **not C2**, then C1 gets 1 approval, C2 gets 0 → C1 wins.

Then you get 9.

If you approve **C2**, and not C1, then C2 gets 1, C1 gets 0 → C2 wins → you get 7.

If you approve **both**, then both get 1 approval → maximum approvals is 1 → both are tied → randomly pick one of them → you get **50% chance of 9, 50% chance of 7** → expected value: 0.5×9 + 0.5×7 = 4.5 + 3.5 = **8**

Which is better than 7, but worse than 9.

So:

- Approve C1 only: get 9
- Approve C2 only: get 7
- Approve both: get 8

So **best is to approve C1 only**, giving you **9 points**

But is there a catch?

Wait — **C1 is proposed by Player 1**, who is **the other player**.

If you approve C1, and they also approve, then C1 passes — you get 9.

But **do they care?**

But you only care about **your points**, not theirs.

But could they reject C1?

But **you are only deciding your own approval**, not theirs.

But for C1 to pass, it needs **approval**, and the contract is selected based on **number of approvals**.

So suppose:

- You approve C1
- Player 1 (the other player) → do they approve C1?

Player 1 proposed it — so they likely approve it.

Let’s check: would Player 1 want C1?

Under C1, if Player 1 proposes it, they get:

Their payoff matrix (Player 1):

|          | You: A0 | You: A1 |
|----------|---------|---------|
| P1: A0   | 5–4=1   | 0+4=4   |
| P1: A1   | 3+4=7   | 3       |

Wait: no.

Player 1's payoff:

- If **you** play A0 → Player 1 gets **–4** (since payment drawn from them)
- If **you** play A1 → no penalty

But if **Player 1** plays A0 → they get +4 (from contract), but lose 4 if **you** play A0

So:

- (P1: A0, You: A0): 5 (base) – 4 (paid to you) + 4 (from contract) = 5
   - Wait — the contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive +4, drawn equally from the other players"

So Player 1 receives +4 if they play A0, and **you lose 4** (because payment drawn from you)

So payoffs:

- (A0, A0): Player 1 gets 5 (base) +4 (contract) –4 (from you playing A0)? Wait — no.

Clarify: "drawn equally from the other players" — that means **the +4 is funded by the other player**.

So if **both** play A0 → Player 1 gets +4 (from contract), but **you** get –4 (because you paid it)

But base payoff: (A0, A0) = 5,5

With contract: Player 1 gets 5 + 4 = 9? But where does the 4 come from?

The contract says: "drawn equally from the other players" — so if **Player 1** plays A0, they get +4, and **you** lose 4.

So **the 4 comes from you**.

So:
- (A0, A0): Player 1 gets 5 + 4 = 9, you get 5 – 4 = 1

But that seems symmetric.

Wait — in (A0, A0), both get +4? But only one is paying?

No: the contract says that **if a player chooses A0**, they get +4, and the **payment is drawn equally from the other players**.

So:

- If **you** play A0 → you get +4, and **Player 1** pays –4
- If **Player 1** plays A0 → Player 1 gets +4, and **you** pay –4

So if both play A0 → both get +4, and each pays –4 → so net: both have **no net change** from contract? But wait — the +4 is **from** the other player.

So:
- You: +4 (from contract) –4 (paid to Player 1) = 0 net
- Player 1: +4 (from contract) –4 (paid to you) = 0 net

So in (A0, A0), contract has **no net effect**? But that contradicts earlier.

Wait — think carefully.

Suppose:
- Player 1 plays A0 → they get +4 from contract
- You play A0 → you get +4 from contract

But the +4 is **drawn from the other players**.

So who pays?

The contract says: "drawn equally from the other players"

But if both play A0, **who pays the +4**?

It says: **"If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."**

So it's **per-player**: each A0 choice triggers a +4 for that player, funded by the other player.

So if **you** play A0 → you get +4, funded by Player 1 → so Player 1 pays –4

If **Player 1** plays A0 → Player 1 gets +4, funded by you → so you pay –4

So in (A0, A0): you pay –4 (to Player 1), and receive +4 (from contract) → net 0

Player 1: pays –4 (to you), receives +4 (from contract) → net 0

Base payoff: 5,5 → so final: 5,5

But earlier I thought you get 9 — that was a **mistake**.

You thought: "if you play A0, you get +4, drawn from the other player"

But **when you play A0**, you get +4, and **the other player pays –4**

So your total: base + contract gain

But in (A0, A0): base = 5, contract: +4 (from contract) –4 (what you paid) = 0 → total = 5

Wait — but who is paying?

The contract says: “drawn equally from the other players” — “equal” could mean divided among multiple others, but only one other player.

So “drawn equally from the other players” — if only one other player, then the full 4 is taken from them.

So: when you play A0, you get +4, and **Player 1 pays –4**

So your total: base (5) + 4 (contract) – 4 (payment to Player 1) = 5

But you paid –4 to Player 1, and received +4 from contract — so net +0

So total: 5

But is that right?

No — wait: the **+4 is funded by the other player**, not by you.

But you **receive** +4, and the other player **pays** –4.

So if both play A0:
- You: receive +4 (contract), pay –4 (to Player 1) → net 0
- Player 1: receive +4 (contract), pay –4 (to you) → net 0

So **no net gain for either**

But base payoff is 5,5 → so final: still 5,5

But in (A0, A1):
- You: play A0 → get +4 (contract) –4 (from Player 1) = 0; base: 0 → total: 0
- Player 1: play A1 → no contract, so no +4, but you played A0 → you paid –4 to Player 1? Wait — no.

If Player 1 plays A1 → they do **not** get +4.

But you play A0 → you **do** get +4, and **Player 1** is **the other player**, so Player 1 pays –4 to you.

So:
- You: base 0 + 4 (contract) – 4 (paid to Player 1)? No.

Clarify:

- When **you** play A0 → you get +4 → payment drawn from other player (Player 1) → so Player 1 loses 4
- When **Player 1** plays A0 → Player 1 gets +4 → you lose 4

So in (A0, A1):
- You play A0 → you get +4, and Player 1 pays –4 to you → so you gain +4 from contract, lose nothing
- Player 1 plays A1 → gets no +4, but you played A0 → so you paid –4 to Player 1? But **you didn't pay** — you **received** +4, so you must have **gained**, not lost.

This is inconsistent.

Let’s define:

The **payment** is transferred from the **other player** to you when you play A0.

So:
- If you play A0, **you receive +4**, and **Player 1 gives you −4** → net: you gain 4
- If Player 1 plays A0, **Player 1 receives +4**, and **you give them −4**

So:

In (A0, A0):
- You: +4 (contract) – 4 (payment to Player 1) = 0
- Player 1: +4 (contract) – 4 (payment to you) = 0
- Base: 5,5 → final: 5,5

In (A0, A1):
- You: play A0 → receive +4; no payment from Player 1 (since Player 1 played A1, no "drawn")
  - So you gain +4
  - Base: 0 → total: 4
- Player 1: play A1 → no +4; you played A0 → so you should pay –4 to Player 1? But you received +4, so net you gained 4.

Conflict: if you played A0, you receive +4, and the other player pays –4 to you.

But in (A0, A1), other player (Player 1) played A1, so they don't trigger the payment, but you played A0, so you should get +4, and **Player 1 should pay you –4**? But why?

The contract says: "drawn equally from the other players" — so if **you** play A0, then **from the other player(s)**, you get +4.

But "other players" — only one other, so the full 4 is drawn from them.

So even if they played A1, if you played A0, they must pay you –4.

Similarly, if they play A0, you must pay them –4.

So the **payment is triggered by your action**, not theirs.

So the contract is: **whenever you play A0, you gain +4, and the other player loses 4** — regardless of what they play.

Similarly for them.

So the payment depends only on **your own action**.

So this is **not mutual**.

So:

- If you play A0: you get +4, other loses 4
- If you play A1: nothing

- If other plays A0: they get +4, you lose 4
- If other plays A1: nothing

So in (A0, A1):
- You play A0 → you gain +4, other (Player 1) loses 4
- Player 1 plays A1 → no gain, but you paid the loss.

Wait — you get +4, player 1 loses 4.

So your final: base 0 + 4 = 4
Player 1: base 3 – 4 = –1

Similarly, (A1, A0):
- You: A1 → no gain, no loss
- Player 1: A0 → get +4, you lose 4
- So you: base 3 – 4 = –1
- Player 1: base 0 + 4 = 4

(A0, A0): you get +4, other loses 4 → you: 5 +4 –4 = 5; other: 5 +4 –4 = 5

(A1, A1): no changes → 3,3

So payoffs under C1:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| You: A0  | 5,5    | 4,–1  |
| You: A1  | –1,4   | 3,3    |

Your payoffs:
- A0: 5 if P1 A0, 4 if P1 A1
- A1: –1 if P1 A0, 3 if P1 A1

So your payoffs are:
- A0: always ≥ 4
- A1: –1 or 3

So you will **never** play A1 — even if P1 plays A1, A0 gives 4, A1 gives 3 → so A0 better.

So you play A0 with probability 1.

Then P1: if you play A0, they get:
- A0: 5 (base +4 –4) = 5
- A1: –1 (base 3 – 4)
→ so they prefer A0

So outcome: (A0, A0), you get 5 points.

But earlier I thought you get 9 — that was wrong.

You get 5.

But in base game you get 5 — so no gain.

But wait — in (A0, A0), you get 5, same as before.

But in (A0, A1), you get 4 — better than 0 in base.

But in equilibrium, you get 5.

So under C1, you get **5**, same as base.

But you might not gain.

Now, C2: you proposed it.

C2: if a player plays A0, they get +2, drawn from other player.

So same logic.

Your payoffs under C2:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| You: A0  | 5,5    | 2,–1  |
| You: A1  | –1,2   | 3,3    |

- You: A0: 5 if P1 A0, 2 if P1 A1
- A1: –1 if P1 A0, 3 if P1 A1

So you prefer A0 against A0 (5>–1), and A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 → so if P1 plays A1, you prefer A1.

So best response:
- If P1 plays A0, you play A0 (5 > –1)
- If P1 plays A1, you play A1 (3 > 2)

P1's best response:
- If you play A0, P1 gets:
  - A0: 5
  - A1: –1 → so plays A0
- If you play A1, P1 gets:
  - A0: 2
  - A1: 3 → so plays A1

So Nash equilibrium: (A0, A0) or (A1, A1)? (A0, A0) is not equilibrium because if you play A0, P1 plays A0, good.

If you play A1, P1 plays A1, and you play A1.

But (A0, A0): you get 5, P1 gets 5

 (A1, A1): you get 3, P1 gets 3

So (A0, A0) is better for you.

Could both agree on (A0, A0)? Yes.

So you get 5 under C2 as well.

But in base game, you can get 5 or 3, so you can get 5.

So under both contracts, you can get 5.

But C1 allows you to get 5, C2 also.

But C1 is proposed by Player 1, C2 by Player 2.

Now, which would you approve?

You want to maximize your chance of getting high points.

But under both contracts, if played optimally, you get 5.

But in C1, you get 5, and if they play A0, you get 5.

In C2, also 5.

But earlier mistake: the contract doesn't add to your payoff because of the counter- payment.

So net gain is zero in (A0, A0).

But in (A0, A1), you get 4 in C1, 2 in C2 — better than base 0.

But in equilibrium, you get 5.

So both give you 5.

But perhaps in mixed strategies.

But let's assume players play best response.

So you get 5 in both cases.

But you might want to approve C2, because you proposed it, but you care only about points.

But if you approve C1, and they approve it, you get 5.

If you approve C2, and they approve, you get 5.

So same.

But to maximize the probability that a good contract is selected, you should approve contracts that you like.

But both give same payoff.

But C2 is your own contract, so you might want to approve it.

But you want to maximize your expected points.

Since both give you 5, it doesn't matter.

But let's check if you can get more.

In C1, if you play A0, and if P1 plays A1, you get 4, which is better than base 0.

But in equilibrium, P1 plays A0, so you get 5.

Similarly for C2.

So no difference.

But in C2, the penalty is smaller, so you get more in (A0, A1): 2 vs 4 in C1? No:

In C1, (A0, A1): you get 4
In C2, (A0, A1): you get 2

But in (A1, A1): you get 3 in both.

In (A0, A0): 5 in both.

So C1 gives you more in (A0, A1).

But we don't expect that to happen.

So for you, both are equivalent.

But to increase the chance that a contract is selected, you should approve both.

Then both have at least your approval.

If you approve both, and they approve their own, then both have 2 approvals.

If you don't approve one, it has 1.

So to maximize the number of approvals for your preferred contract, you should approve both.

But both give you the same 5 points.

So approve both.

Then winning contract is chosen at random between them, you get 5.

If you approve only C2, and they approve C2, you get 5.

Same.

But since the winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with max approvals, if you approve both, and if they approve both, then both have 2 approvals, so random.

If you approve only C2, and they approve only C2, then only C2 has 2 approvals, so it wins.

But if they approve C1, then C1 has 1, C2 has 1, so random.

But you can't control their approval.

To maximize your expected points, and since you get 5 in both, and both are the same, you might as well approve both.

But let's see if there's a difference.

In C1, the payment is 4, in C2, 2.

But in equilibrium, you get 5.

So no difference.

Therefore, you should approve both, to increase the chances of a contract being selected, and since both are equally good, it's fine.

But you might not want to approve C1 if it helps the other player more.

But you care about your points.

The other player's payoff under C1:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): –1
- So they prefer to play A0 if you play A0.

Under C2: (A0, A0): 5, (A0, A1): –1, same.

So same.

So no difference.

Therefore, you can approve both.

But earlier I thought you get 9, but that was a mistake.

So correct payoffs:

- C1: you get 5
- C2: you get 5

So both are identical for you.

So approve both.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!


Instruction:

- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy we need to consider both the initial game payoffs and the points adjustments due to the contract.

### Initial Payoff Matrix:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0    | A1    |
|---------------------|-------|-------|
| **A0**              | 5, 5  | 0, 3  |
| **A1**              | 3, 0  | 3, 3  |

### Contract Adjustments:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 1 point and it is taken equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points, distributed to the other player.

### New Effective Payoff Matrix:

To convert the initial payoffs with the contract adjustments:

#### Scenario where both players choose A0:
- Player 1: 5 + 1 = 6 
- Player 2: 5 + 1 = 6 

#### Scenario where Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
- Player 1: (0 - 2) + 3 = 1
- Player 2: (3 + 1)  = 4

#### Scenario where Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
- Player 1: (5 + 1)  = 6
- Player 2: (0 - 2) = -2

#### Scenario where both choose A1:
- Player 1: 3 - 2 = 1
- Player 2: 3 - 2 = 1

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0 (adjusted) | A1 (adjusted) |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**              | 6, 6          | 4, 1          |
| **A1**              | -2, 6         | 1, 1          |

### Strategy Analysis:
We can calculate the expected payoffs for each pure strategy:

#### Player 2 selects A0:
- If Player 1 selects A0: Player 2 gets 6 points.
- If Player 1 selects A1: Player 2 gets 4 points.

#### Player 2 selects A1:
- If Player 1 selects A0: Player 2 gets -2 points.
- If Player 1 selects A1: Player 2 gets 1 point.

Given the payoff matrix and evaluating the best responses:
- Player 2 selecting A0 consistently yields better results against most possibilities.
- Selecting A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.

Thus, the optimal strategy is to always choose A0.

### Final Decision:
```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

This means that Player 2 should allocate a probability of 100% to choosing Action A0.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

Without contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- If I play A0: I receive +4 from Player 1
- If Player 1 plays A0: I pay -4 to Player 1

New payoffs for me (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 4 = **-1** (wait, let me recalculate)

Actually, let me be clearer:
- When I play A0, other plays A0: Base 5, I get +4, I pay -4 = **5**
- When I play A0, other plays A1: Base 0, I get +4, I pay 0 = **4**
- When I play A1, other plays A0: Base 3, I get 0, I pay -4 = **-1**
- When I play A1, other plays A1: Base 3, no contract payments = **3**

## Step 3: Analyze Player 1's incentives with contract

Player 1's payoffs with contract:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 4
- (A1, A0): -1
- (A1, A1): 3

Player 1 has a **dominant strategy**: A0 (always better than A1 regardless of my choice)

## Step 4: Determine my best response

Given Player 1 will definitely play A0 (dominant strategy):
- If I play A0: I get **5**
- If I play A1: I get **-1**

So I should play A0, yielding **(A0, A0) → 5 points for me**

## Step 5: Compare to no-contract scenario

Without contract: The game has coordination problems with two pure Nash equilibria (A0,A0) giving 5 and (A1,A1) giving 3, plus a mixed equilibrium giving ~3 expected points. There's risk of miscoordination.

With contract: Clear dominant strategy equilibrium at (A0, A0) giving me 5 points with certainty.

## Conclusion

The contract eliminates strategic uncertainty and guarantees the best equilibrium outcome of 5 points. I should sign.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
The game is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) yields the highest payoff for both players (5 points each), (A1, A1) is often considered the "risk-dominant" equilibrium because choosing A1 limits a player's downside. In the original game, without a contract, if Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 receives 0 points. By choosing A1 instead, Player 2 guarantees themselves at least 3 points regardless of Player 1's action (a maximin strategy).

The proposed contract changes the game's incentives by penalizing the choice of A1 and rewarding the opponent when A1 is chosen. Under the contract:
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 4 points and the other player receives 4 points.
- If both players choose A0, the payoffs remain (5, 5).
- If one player chooses A1 and the other chooses A0, the player choosing A1 receives -1 (3 original - 4 payment), and the player choosing A0 receives 4 (0 original + 4 payment).
- If both players choose A1, the payoffs remain (3, 3) because each player both pays and receives 4 points.

With the contract active, A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both players. No matter what Player 1 does, Player 2 is better off choosing A0 (if Player 1 plays A0, 5 > -1; if Player 1 plays A1, 4 > 3). This eliminates the risk of coordination failure and ensures that both players move toward the Pareto-optimal outcome of (A0, A0), receiving 5 points. Since the contract only becomes active if both players sign it, and it makes the best possible outcome the most rational choice, signing the contract is the optimal decision to maximize total points.

response:
To choose your best probability distribution, compare your *final* payoffs (base payoff + contract transfers) for each of your actions, against each possible action of Player 1.

**Contract effect:** If you play **A1**, you pay 4 points to the other player (since there’s only one other player). If Player 1 plays **A1**, you receive 4 points from them.

### Compute your (Player 2) payoffs including the contract

1) **Player 1 plays A0**
- You play **A0**: base 5, no transfers ⇒ **5**
- You play **A1**: base 3, you pay 4 ⇒ **3 − 4 = -1**
Best response: **A0**

2) **Player 1 plays A1**
- You play **A0**: base 0, you receive 4 from Player 1 ⇒ **0 + 4 = 4**
- You play **A1**: base 3, you pay 4 and receive 4 (net 0) ⇒ **3**
Best response: **A0**

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you: it yields a higher payoff no matter what Player 1 does. Therefore, to maximize your expected points, put all probability on **A0**.

First, incorporate the contract into the payoffs.

Contract effects (2 players):
- If you play **A1**, you **pay 4** to the other player ⇒ your payoff **−4**.
- If the other player plays **A1**, they **pay 4** to you ⇒ your payoff **+4**.

So your (Player 1) effective payoff matrix becomes:
- (A0, A0): \(5\)
- (A0, A1): \(0 + 4 = 4\)
- (A1, A0): \(3 - 4 = -1\)
- (A1, A1): \(3 - 4 + 4 = 3\)

Now compare your actions against each possible opponent action:
- If opponent plays **A0**: A0 gives **5**, A1 gives **−1** ⇒ A0 is better.
- If opponent plays **A1**: A0 gives **4**, A1 gives **3** ⇒ A0 is better.

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**, meaning the best strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

First incorporate the contract into your payoffs.

**Contract effects on your payoff (Player 1):**
- If **you** play **A0**: you get **+1**.
- If **you** play **A1**: you get **-2**.
- If the **other player** plays **A0**: they take **1** from you, so you get **-1**.
- If the **other player** plays **A1**: they pay **2** to you, so you get **+2**.

So your **net contract adjustment** is:
- **(+1 or -2)** depending on your action, **plus**
- **(-1 or +2)** depending on their action.

Now compute your **adjusted payoff matrix**:

- (A0, A0): base 5 + (you A0:+1) + (they A0:-1) = **5**
- (A0, A1): base 0 + (you A0:+1) + (they A1:+2) = **3**
- (A1, A0): base 3 + (you A1:-2) + (they A0:-1) = **0**
- (A1, A1): base 3 + (you A1:-2) + (they A1:+2) = **3**

So:

|             | Other A0 | Other A1 |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **You A0**  | 5        | 3        |
| **You A1**  | 0        | 3        |

**Best-response reasoning:**
- If the other plays **A0**, you strictly prefer **A0** (5 > 0).
- If the other plays **A1**, you are indifferent (**3 = 3**).

Thus **A0 weakly dominates A1**, and choosing **A0 with 100%** maximizes your expected payoff against any reasonable belief (and never does worse than A1).

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To maximize my total points in this game, I need to analyze the payoff structure and consider the potential behavior of Player 2.

1.  **Payoff Structure Analysis:**
    *   (A0, A0): 5, 5
    *   (A0, A1): 0, 3
    *   (A1, A0): 3, 0
    *   (A1, A1): 3, 3
    This is a version of a coordination game (specifically a Stag Hunt). There are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0), which is payoff-dominant (5 points each), and (A1, A1), which is risk-dominant (3 points each).

2.  **Safety and Risk:**
    *   If I choose A1, I am guaranteed 3 points regardless of Player 2's action.
    *   If I choose A0, I receive 5 points if Player 2 chooses A0, but 0 points if Player 2 chooses A1.
    *   Mathematically, choosing A0 is superior only if I believe the probability ($p$) of Player 2 choosing A0 is greater than 0.6 ($5p + 0(1-p) > 3$).

3.  **The Impact of the Proposed Contract:**
    *   The contract would have made choosing A0 safer for both players. Under the contract, a player choosing A0 would receive 2 points from the other player if that player chose A1. This would change the (A0, A1) payoff for me from 0 to 2, and the (A1, A0) payoff for Player 2 from 0 to 2.
    *   For the A1 player, choosing A1 while the other chose A0 would lead to a penalty (dropping from 3 points to 1 point).
    *   Crucially, **Player 2 rejected this contract.** By doing so, Player 2 ensured that they would receive 3 points for playing A1, rather than risking the penalty of dropping to 1 point.

4.  **Inference of Player 2’s Strategy:**
    *   A player intending to play A0 (the cooperative, high-reward choice) would rationally favor the contract because it provides a safety net (2 points instead of 0).
    *   A player intending to play A1 (the safe choice) would rationally reject the contract to avoid the potential penalty.
    *   Since Player 2 proposed the contract and then rejected it, it strongly suggests they value the guaranteed 3 points of A1 and do not trust that we would both coordinate on A0.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    Given that Player 2's rejection of the contract implies they are likely to play A1, my best response is to play A1. If I choose A0 and Player 2 plays A1, I receive 0 points. If I choose A1, I am guaranteed 3 points.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

- Both play A0: I get 5
- I play A0, Player 1 plays A1: I get 0
- I play A1, Player 1 plays A0: I get 3
- Both play A1: I get 3

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (penalty of 4 points for playing A1)

Modified payoffs:
- Both A0: (5, 5)
- Player 1 plays A0, I play A1: I pay 4 to P1, so I get 3-4=-1, P1 gets 0+4=4
- Player 1 plays A1, I play A0: P1 pays 4 to me, so I get 0+4=4, P1 gets 3-4=-1
- Both A1: Both pay 4 and receive 4, so (3, 3)

**Analysis**: With C1, A0 becomes strictly dominant for both players:
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 points) over A1 (-1 points)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A0 (4 points) over A1 (3 points)

This guarantees the (A0, A0) outcome with **5 points** for me.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (penalty of 1 point for playing A1)

Modified payoffs:
- Both A0: (5, 5)
- Player 1 plays A0, I play A1: I get 3-1=2, P1 gets 0+1=1
- Player 1 plays A1, I play A0: I get 0+1=1, P1 gets 3-1=2
- Both A1: (3, 3)

**Analysis**: Still has two Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): Best mutual outcome, **5 points**
- (A1, A1): Fallback equilibrium, **3 points**

However, C2 reduces the incentive to defect from A0 (only get 2 instead of 3), making (A0, A0) more stable than in the base game.

## Step 4: Compare options

1. **C1**: Guarantees 5 points by eliminating coordination risk
2. **C2**: Likely 5 points with improved coordination, small risk of 3 points
3. **No contract**: Similar to C2 but with slightly higher coordination risk

## Step 5: Decision

- **C1** is clearly beneficial - it guarantees the best outcome
- **C2** is better than no contract since it stabilizes cooperation

Both contracts improve my expected payoff compared to the base game. Even if both get approved and one is randomly selected, both lead to good outcomes.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the actual payoffs with the contract

Let me combine the base game payoffs with the contract:

**When I (Player 2) choose A0:**
- vs A0: Base 5 + 4 (my contract bonus) - 4 (their contract bonus) = **5 points**
- vs A1: Base 0 + 4 (my contract bonus) - 0 (no payment) = **4 points**

**When I (Player 2) choose A1:**
- vs A0: Base 3 + 0 (no bonus) - 4 (their contract bonus) = **-1 points**
- vs A1: Base 3 + 0 (no bonus) - 0 (no payment) = **3 points**

## Step 2: Construct my payoff matrix

```
                Player 1's choice
                A0      A1
My choice  A0   5       4
           A1   -1      3
```

## Step 3: Check for dominant strategy

Comparing A0 vs A1:
- Against their A0: I get 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → **A0 is better**
- Against their A1: I get 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - it gives me a higher payoff regardless of what Player 1 does!

## Step 4: Determine optimal strategy

Since A0 is strictly dominant, my optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

This makes sense: the contract adds 4 points for choosing A0, which more than compensates for scenarios where A0 would have been less attractive in the base game. The contract essentially makes cooperation (A0) highly incentivized.

The game's outcome is determined by the combined impact of the base payoffs and the payment contract. 

1.  **Analyze the Base Payoffs (P1, P2):**
    *   (A0, A0): P1 gets 5, P2 gets 5
    *   (A1, A0): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0

    The contract adds a 4-point penalty for choosing A1, which is then paid to the other player.
    *   **Scenario (A0, A0):** No penalties. P1: 5, P2: 5.
    *   **Scenario (A1, A0):** P1 pays 4 to P2. P1: 3 - 4 = -1, P2: 0 + 4 = 4.
    *   **Scenario (A0, A1):** P2 pays 4 to P1. P1: 0 + 4 = 4, P2: 3 - 4 = -1.
    *   **Scenario (A1, A1):** Both pay 4 and receive 4. P1: 3 - 4 + 4 = 3, P2: 3 - 4 + 4 = 3.

3.  **Evaluate the New Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
    *   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
    *   (A1, A0): (-1, 4)
    *   (A0, A1): (4, -1)
    *   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

4.  **Identify the Dominant Strategy:**
    *   For Player 2 (you): 
        *   If Player 1 chooses A0, A0 gives you 5 points and A1 gives you -1. A0 is better.
        *   If Player 1 chooses A1, A0 gives you 4 points and A1 gives you 3. A0 is better.
        A0 is the dominant strategy for Player 2.
    *   For Player 1:
        *   If Player 2 chooses A0, A0 gives Player 1 5 points and A1 gives Player 1 -1. A0 is better.
        *   If Player 2 chooses A1, A0 gives Player 1 4 points and A1 gives Player 1 3. A0 is better.
        A0 is the dominant strategy for Player 1.

Since A0 is the dominant strategy for both players and leads to the highest possible payoff of 5 points each, the optimal decision is to select A0 with 100% probability.

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Under each contract, I compare the incentives it creates (i.e., the Nash equilibrium of the modified payoff game) and my resulting expected points.

### Contract C1 (A1 pays 4 to the other player)
Modified payoffs for me (Player 1):
- (A0,A0): 5  
- (A0,A1): 0 + 4 = 4  
- (A1,A0): 3 − 4 = -1  
- (A1,A1): 3 (payments cancel)

So if Player 2 plays A0, my best response is A0 (5 > -1).  
If Player 2 plays A1, my best response is also A0 (4 > 3).  

Therefore **A0 strictly dominates** under C1, giving a **unique equilibrium (A0,A0)** with payoff **5** for me.

### Contract C2 (A0 receives 2 from the other player)
Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0,A0): still 5 (the +2 and -2 cancel when both play A0)
- (A0,A1): 0 + 2 = 2
- (A1,A0): 3 − 2 = 1
- (A1,A1): 3

Best responses:
- If Player 2 plays A0, I prefer A0 (5 > 1).
- If Player 2 plays A1, I prefer A1 (3 > 2).

So C2 still has **two equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1). That leaves coordination risk and can result in only **3** for me.

### Approval choice
C1 guarantees the efficient outcome (5 for me). C2 does not improve on baseline and leaves risk of ending at 3. So I approve C1 and reject C2.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

| My Action | Opponent's A0 | Opponent's A1 |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| A0        | 5             | 0             |
| A1        | 3             | 3             |

## Step 2: Analyze the contract's effect

The contract imposes a 4-point penalty on choosing A1, paid to the other player.

With the contract, payoffs become:
| My Action | Opponent's A0 | Opponent's A1 |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| A0        | 5             | 0 + 4 = 4     |
| A1        | 3 - 4 = -1    | 3 - 4 + 4 = 3 |

(When opponent plays A1, I receive 4 points. When I play A1, I pay 4 points.)

## Step 3: Compare strategic situations

**Without contract:**
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A1 (3 > 0)
- Multiple equilibria exist: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)
- Risk of coordination failure or mixed strategies yielding expected payoff of 3

**With contract:**
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > -1) ✓
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A0 (4 > 3) ✓
- A0 becomes my **dominant strategy**
- Unique equilibrium: (A0, A0) guaranteeing 5 points

## Step 4: Decision

The contract makes A0 dominant for both players, eliminating the risk of ending up in the inferior (A1, A1) equilibrium or mixed strategy outcomes. It guarantees the best outcome of 5 points.

response:
First incorporate the contract into your payoffs (Player 1):

- If you play **A0**, you receive **+5** from Player 2 (because you chose A0).
- If Player 2 plays **A0**, you pay **-5** to Player 2 (because they chose A0).
- If you play **A1**, no transfers happen for you due to your action.

Now compute Player 1’s total payoff (base payoff + transfers):

1) **(A0, A0)**: base = 5; you receive +5 (you chose A0) and pay -5 (they chose A0) ⇒ net transfer 0 ⇒ total **5**  
2) **(A0, A1)**: base = 0; you receive +5; pay 0 ⇒ total **5**  
3) **(A1, A0)**: base = 3; you pay -5 ⇒ total **-2**  
4) **(A1, A1)**: base = 3; no transfers ⇒ total **3**

So your payoffs are:

- If you play **A0**: you get **5** regardless of what Player 2 does.
- If you play **A1**: you get **-2** if they play A0, and **3** if they play A1.

Therefore, **A0 strictly dominates A1**, since it always yields a higher payoff (5 vs at most 3). The optimal strategy is to play A0 with probability 100%.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)
- (Me A0, Other A0): I get 5
- (Me A0, Other A1): I get 0  
- (Me A1, Other A0): I get 3
- (Me A1, Other A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Apply the contract
The contract states: If a player chooses A1, they pay 4 points distributed equally among other players.

Since there are only 2 players:
- If I choose A1: I pay 4 points to the other player
- If other chooses A1: Other pays 4 points to me

## Step 3: Calculate final payoffs with contract

- (Me A0, Other A0): I get 5 + 0 - 0 = **5**
- (Me A0, Other A1): I get 0 + 4 - 0 = **4** (I receive 4 from other's penalty)
- (Me A1, Other A0): I get 3 + 0 - 4 = **-1** (I pay 4 penalty)
- (Me A1, Other A1): I get 3 + 4 - 4 = **3** (I receive 4, pay 4)

## Step 4: Analyze optimal strategy

My payoff matrix:
```
              Other A0    Other A1
My A0            5           4
My A1           -1           3
```

Comparing my actions:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - it's better regardless of what the other player does.

## Step 5: Determine optimal probability distribution

Since A0 is a dominant strategy, I should play A0 with 100% probability to maximize my expected payoff.

| A1         | A1                    | 3           | 3                      |

This is similar to a coordination game with a twist: mutual A0 gives the highest payoff (5,5), but if you choose A0 and the other chooses A1, you get 0 (bad); if you choose A1 and the other chooses A0, you get 3 (better than 0, but worse than 5).

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria without contracts.

#### Best Responses:
- If you believe the other plays A0:
  - You get 5 if you play A0
  - You get 3 if you play A1 → so best response is A0
- If you believe the other plays A1:
  - You get 0 if you play A0
  - You get 3 if you play A1 → so best response is A1

So the game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

Also, there's a mixed strategy equilibrium, but we'll come back to that later.

The efficient outcome is (A0, A0), but (A1, A1) is also stable.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanisms**

A **contract** modifies the payoffs by adding payments based on the action taken.

#### Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):
> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payments
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional payment of 4 points, **distributed equally among the other players**

Since there are two players, “distributed equally among the other players” means:
- When a player chooses A1, they **lose 4 points**, and the **other player gains 2 points** (because 4 split between 1 other player? Wait — "equally among the other players". If you're the only player, “other players” is just the opponent.

So:
- If **you** choose A1 → you lose 4 points (i.e., pay 4), and the **other player gains 2 points**.
- If the **other player** chooses A1 → they lose 4, you gain 2.

So this is a **penalty** on choosing A1, and the cost is shared: the player who chooses A1 pays 4, and the other gets 2.

So net effect:
- If **you** play A1, you get -4 extra, opponent gets +2 extra.
- If **opponent** plays A1, you get +2 extra, they get -4 extra.

This is a **cost to choosing A1**.

#### Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):
> - If a player chooses A0: they receive an additional payment of 2 points, **drawn equally from the other players**
> - If a player chooses A1: no additional payments

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +2, and the **other player loses 2** (since the 2 points come from the other player)
- If **opponent** chooses A0 → they get +2, you lose 2

So this is a **subsidy for choosing A0**, funded by the other player.

---

### **Step 3: Determine Your Preferences – You are Player 2**

You are **Player 2** in the game. Your goal is to **maximize your total expected points**, including both base game payoffs and any extra payments from contracts.

We now need to evaluate **which contracts (C1 and C2)** you would want to **approve**.

Note: Approval voting. The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So your **approval choice** matters in two ways:
1. It determines whether the contract can win.
2. If a contract wins, you get the resulting payoffs.

So you want to **approve contracts that lead to better outcomes for you in expectation**, but you must consider both:
- Whether you want the contract to be in effect (i.e., whether it improves your payoff in equilibrium)
- Whether approving it increases the chance of a contract being selected that you prefer.

But because the winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from those with **max approvals**, your best strategy is to **approve contracts that you believe are good for you**, and **not approve ones that are bad**, to avoid diluting the approval of good contracts.

But also: if a contract is good for you, you want it approved, because if it wins, you get better payoff.

So: **approve a contract iff it improves your expected payoff (in the resulting equilibrium) compared to not having any contract (or default: no contract wins)**.

But we don’t know what happens if **no contract is approved** — but in this setup, **only contracts with approvals can be selected**, so the outcome depends on **which contracts are approved**.

But the **winning contract is chosen at random from those with the max number of approvals**.

Therefore, **your decision affects which contracts are even in the running**.

Let’s analyze each contract's effect on the game, from **your perspective as Player 2**.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

C1: Penalty of 4 for choosing A1, paid to opponent.

So if you choose A1 → you lose 4, and the other player (Player 1) gains 2.

But if you choose A0 → no change.

So let’s **rewrite the payoff matrix with C1** (in addition to base game).

We are Player 2.

#### Payoff matrix under C1:

| You (P2) | P1 | Your Total Payoff (Base + Contract) |
|---------|----|-------------------------------|
| A0      | A0 | 5 + 0 = 5 |
| A0      | A1 | 0 + 0 = 0 (P1 chooses A1 → you get +2, but P1 pays 4 → you get +2 from contract) → wait! Let’s be careful.

Wait: The contract says: “if a player chooses A1, they pay 4, distributed equally among other players.”

So:

- If **you (P2)** choose A1 → you lose 4 points (i.e., -4), and **P1** gains +2.
- If **P1** chooses A1 → P1 loses 4, and **you (P2)** gain +2.

So when computing your payoff:
- If you play A0 and P1 plays A1 → your base payoff is 0 (from original game), but **you gain +2** from P1’s A1 choice → so total = 0 + 2 = 2
- If you play A1 and P1 plays A0 → your base payoff is 3, but **you pay -4**, so total = 3 - 4 = -1
- If both A1 → you get base 3, minus 4 from your own action → so 3 - 4 = -1, and P1 gets 3 - 4 = -1, and you get +2 from P1’s action? No — **only the player who chooses A1 pays**.

Important: The payment is **only based on your own action**.

So:
- Your total payoff = base payoff + (if you play A1, then -4) + (if opponent plays A1, then +2)

Similarly for P1.

So let’s build the full matrix for **you (P2)** under C1:

| You \ P1 | A0                     | A1                                   |
|----------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| A0       | Base: 5; contract: 0 → 5 | Base: 0; contract: +2 (because P1 played A1) → 2 |
| A1       | Base: 3; contract: -4 → -1 | Base: 3; contract: -4 (your action) and +2 (P1's action) → 3 - 4 + 2 = 1 |

So the matrix is:

|          | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|----------|-------|-------|
| You A0   | 5     | 2     |
| You A1   | -1    | 1     |

Now, find best responses for you (P2):

- If P1 plays A0:
  - You get 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - You get 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is strictly dominant for you** under C1.

Now for P1 (Player 1) — let’s compute their payoff under C1:

| P1 \ You | A0                     | A1                                   |
|----------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| A0       | Base: 5; contract: 0 → 5 | Base: 3; contract: +2 (you played A1) → 5 |
| A1       | Base: 0; contract: -4 → -4 | Base: 3; contract: -4 (P1’s action) and +2 (you → P1) → 3 - 4 + 2 = 1 |

Wait — P1’s perspective:

- If P1 plays A1, they pay -4
- If you (P2) play A1, P1 gains +2

So:

| P1 \ You | A0                     | A1                                   |
|----------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| A0       | 5                      | 3 + 2 = 5                            |
| A1       | 0 - 4 = -4             | 3 - 4 + 2 = 1                        |

So P1’s payoffs:
|          | You A0 | You A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| P1 A0    | 5      | 5      |
| P1 A1    | -4     | 1      |

So P1’s best response:
- If You play A0: 5 vs -4 → A0
- If You play A1: 5 vs 1 → A0

So A0 is **also strictly dominant for P1**.

So under C1, **both players prefer A0**, so (A0, A0) is the **unique Nash equilibrium**.

Your payoff: 5

This is better than the original game where (A0,A0) is possible but not guaranteed — but under C1, it’s enforced.

In original game: (A0,A0) is Nash, so if both players coordinate, you get 5.

But under C1, even if players are uncertain, they **have a dominant strategy** to play A0, so it’s robust.

So under C1, you **get 5 for sure**.

So your expected payoff under C1: **5**

---

### **Step 5: Analyze C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

C2: If a player chooses A0, they get +2, funded by the other player.

So:
- If **you (P2)** choose A0 → you gain +2, and **P1 loses 2**
- If **P1** chooses A0 → P1 gets +2, you lose 2

Let’s build the payoff matrix for **you (P2)** under C2.

Base game payoffs + contract modifications.

#### Your payoff calculation:
- You play A0: gain +2
- P1 plays A0: you lose 2 (because P1 gains +2 from you)

So:
| You \ P1 | A0                      | A1                                  |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| A0       | Base: 5 + 2 (your A0) - 2 (P1’s A0) = 5 | Base: 0 + 2 (your A0) = 2 |
| A1       | Base: 3 - 2 (P1’s A0) = 1 | Base: 3 (no contract for A1) = 3 |

Wait: no — the contract says: “if a player chooses A0, they receive +2 from the other player.”

So:
- When **you choose A0**, you get +2, regardless of what P1 does.
- When **P1 chooses A0**, you lose 2 (because you are paying it).

So total for you:

| You \ P1 | A0 (P1's action) | A1 |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| A0       | Base: 5 → +2 (your A0) - 2 (P1’s A0) → 5 + 2 - 2 = 5 | Base: 0 → +2 (your A0) → 0 + 2 = 2 |
| A1       | Base: 3 → -2 (P1’s A0) → 3 - 2 = 1 | Base: 3 → no contract → 3 |

So the matrix for **you (P2)**:

|          | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|----------|-------|-------|
| A0       | 5     | 2     |
| A1       | 1     | 3     |

Now, best responses for you:

- If P1 plays A0: you get 5 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: you get 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So your best responses depend on P1: **no dominant strategy**.

Now compute P1’s payoffs under C2.

P1:
- If P1 plays A0: gets +2, but if you (P2) play A0, P1 loses 2
- If you play A0: P1 loses 2

So:

| P1 \ You | A0                     | A1                                  |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| A0       | Base: 5 + 2 (P1’s A0) - 2 (P2’s A0) = 5 | Base: 3 + 2 (P1’s A0) = 5 |
| A1       | Base: 0 - 2 (P2’s A0) = -2 | Base: 3 → no contract → 3 |

So P1’s matrix:

|          | You A0 | You A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| P1 A0    | 5      | 5      |
| P1 A1    | -2     | 3      |

Best responses for P1:
- If You play A0: 5 vs -2 → A0
- If You play A1: 5 vs 3 → A0

So **A0 is strictly dominant for P1**.

Now go back to you (P2):

Since P1 will play A0 (dominant), then you face:
- If You play A0: get 5
- If You play A1: get 1

So **you will play A0**

So equilibrium: (A0, A0)

Your payoff: 5

Same as under C1.

But wait: is that always the case?

Yes — because P1 has a dominant strategy to play A0, so even if you’re uncertain, you know P1 will play A0, so you play A0.

So under C2, the outcome is **(A0, A0)**, your payoff: **5**

So both C1 and C2 lead to you getting **5** in equilibrium.

But wait — is there a difference?

Yes: **timing and implementation**.

But both lead to (A0, A0), so both give you 5.

But let’s recheck C2.

Under C2:
- You get 5 in (A0,A0)
- But if by chance you thought P1 might play A1, you’d play A1 → but P1 won’t, because A0 is dominant.

So yes, (A0, A0) is the only equilibrium.

So **both contracts lead to you getting 5**.

So is there a difference?

But wait — what if **no contract is approved**? Then it's the original game.

In original game, possible equilibria:
- (A0, A0): you get 5
- (A1, A1): you get 3

But there’s uncertainty — if both players play A1, you get only 3.

But if they coordinate on A0, you get 5.

But without coordination, maybe (A1,A1) is played.

But in the absence of any contract, what happens?

But in this setup, if **no contract is approved**, then **no contract wins**, so what? The game is played without contract?

The rules say: “a payment contract can be put in place if players agree via approval voting.”

So if **no contract is approved**, then **no contract is in effect**, so the game is played as base game.

So under base game, **you might get 5 or 3**, depending on the outcome.

But in equilibrium, **both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)** are Nash equilibria.

But (A0,A0) is payoff dominant.

However, without coordination, players might fail to coordinate — so **expected payoff could be less than 5**.

But in game theory, we usually analyze equilibria.

But if we assume players can coordinate on the efficient equilibrium, then you get 5.

But in this decision context, when you're deciding to approve contracts, you need to consider what **happens if you don't approve any contract**.

But the question is: **do contracts improve your expected payoff?**

Under C1 and C2, you **guarantee** 5.

Under no contract, **in the most optimistic case** (they coordinate on A0), you get 5.

But if they don’t coordinate — which is possible — perhaps they play (A1,A1) → you get 3.

So **with contracts**, you **guarantee 5**.

So you **prefer** either contract to the no-contract case.

But now: **do you prefer one contract over the other?**

Wait — under both, you get 5.

But is there a chance that **only one of them gets approved**, and the other doesn’t, so you get the one that wins?

But your approval affects outcome.

Let’s suppose you approve **both C1 and C2**.

Then both have at least one approval.

Max approvals = 2 (since only two contracts).

Then winner is chosen uniformly at random: 50% chance C1, 50% chance C2.

So your **expected payoff** = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5

If you approve **only C1**, then C1 has 1 approval, C2 has 0 → so max approvals = 1 → C1 wins → you get 5

Similarly, if you approve only C2 → C2 wins → you get 5

So in all cases, **you get 5**.

So **your payoff is 5 regardless**.

But wait — is that true?

Wait: what if **both C1 and C2 are approved**, but **C1 is proposed by Player 1, C2 by Player 2**.

Now, suppose you are Player 2.

Is there a difference in the **contract's effect on your payoff**?

Wait — let’s double-check.

**C1 (by P1)**: You get 5

**C2 (by P2)**: You get 5

So same.

But let’s test:

Suppose only C2 is approved.

Then contract C2 is in effect.

You (P2) play A0 (as we saw), P1 plays A0 → you get 5.

Yes.

C1: both play A0 → you get 5.

Same.

So no difference.

But now: **is one contract easier to approve?**

No — you have to pick based on whether it benefits you.

But both do.

But perhaps the **other player’s incentives** matter?

Wait — in a contract, **if a contract is approved, it may be implemented**, but **only if it wins**.

But if you **disapprove** a contract, it can’t win.

So if you believe another contract is bad, you might disapprove it to prevent it from winning.

But in this case, **both C1 and C2 give you 5**, so neither is bad.

But wait — **C1 is proposed by Player 1**, who is the **other player**.

C2 is proposed by **you (Player 2)**.

If you disapprove C1, then it cannot win.

But if C2 is approved, and C1 is not, then C2 wins.

But you still get 5.

But now: **is there any risk that C1 might lead to a worse outcome?**

No — under C1, you get 5.

So why would you disapprove it?

But let’s think: **does C1 hurt you in any way?**

No.

Similarly, C2 helps you by making you get 5.

Wait — under C1, do you **really** get 5?

Yes: (A0,A0) is the unique equilibrium, payoff 5.

Same for C2.

So both are equally good.

But now: **is C1 *worse* for you than C2?**

No.

But wait — in C1, **you are penalized** for choosing A1.

In C2, **you are rewarded** for choosing A0.

But in equilibrium, you choose A0 in both cases.

So no difference.

But now: **what if players don’t reach equilibrium?**

But we assume rational players.

So both lead to (A0,A0), you get 5.

So **both contracts are equally good for you**.

But now: **what if the game had mixed strategies?**

But in both contracts, the equilibria are pure and unique.

So no issue.

But wait: in C2, suppose **for some reason** P1 plays A1 (even though it's dominated).

But under C2, P1 has **dominant strategy A0**, so they won’t.

Similarly in C1, P1 has dominant strategy A0.

So both are immune to mistakes.

So both are fine.

But **here's a crucial point**: if **you approve only one contract**, and **it wins**, you get 5.

If you approve both, **still get 5** in expectation.

But if you approve only one, and it wins, you get 5.

But if you approve both, and one wins, you get 5.

Same in all cases.

So **your payoff is 5 regardless of your approval choices**, as long as at least one contract is approved (and since C2 is proposed by you, you can control).

Wait — but if you approve **neither**, then **no contract wins**, so you play the base game.

In base game, you get **5 in (A0,A0) equilibrium**, but **3 in (A1,A1)**.

If players coordinate on A0, you get 5.

But if not, you might get 3.

So **expected payoff could be less than 5**.

For example, if players play A0 with 50% chance, you get 4 on average.

But if they play (A0,A0) as focal point, you get 5.

But to be conservative, we should say that without contract, **you might risk getting 3**.

But with contracts, you **guarantee 5**.

So **you prefer to have a contract**.

Now, since both contracts guarantee 5, you can approve either or both.

But now: **do you prefer C2 over C1?**

C2 is **proposed by you** (Player 2).

C1 is proposed by the **other player** (Player 1).

But since both are equally good for you, **you should approve both**.

But is there any reason not to?

Wait — suppose **only C1** is approved.

Then C1 wins.

You get 5.

Fine.

But now, **what if C1 causes P1 to play A0?**

Yes — but we already saw that.

But here’s a twist: **C1 imposes a penalty on A1**, which might hurt you if you ever wanted to play A1 — but in equilibrium, you don’t.

But you don’t want to play A1 anyway.

But in C2, **you get a reward for A0**, which is nice.

But C1 also leads to you getting 5.

So no difference.

But now: **is there a difference in the *expected payoff* under the contract?**

No — both give you 5.

But let’s check again the **payoff under C2**.

When you play A0 and P1 plays A0: you get 5

But let’s confirm:

- Base: 5
- You play A0 → +2 → +2
- P1 plays A0 → you lose 2 → -2
- Total: 5 + 2 - 2 = 5 → correct.

Similarly, under C1: 5

So same.

But in C1, the **penalty is on A1**, so if the game were different, it might be worse — but not here.

So both are equally good.

Therefore, **you should approve both contracts**.

But wait — **what if only C1 is approved by Player 1, and you disapprove it?**

But you can choose to approve or disapprove.

But **you are trying to maximize your payoff**.

Since both give you 5, and 5 > likely payoff in base game (risk of 3), you **want at least one contract to win**.

Approving both increases the chance that one wins (in fact, guarantees that one wins, if you approve both — assuming at least one is approved by someone).

But if you disapprove both, then no contract wins — and you risk getting 3.

So you **should approve at least one**.

But since both are equally good, approving both is **safe and better** in the sense that it ensures a contract wins.

But if only one is approved, the max approvals is 1 → the winning contract is that one → you still get 5.

So no difference.

But if you **approve both**, and both are approved, then max approvals = 2 (if Player 1 approves C1), so winner is random — you still get 5.

But if you **only approve C2**, and Player 1 only approves C1, then both have 1 approval → winner is random → you get 5 with 50% chance, but you get 5 anyway — so 5.

So in all cases, **you get 5**.

So your final expected payoff is **5**, regardless.

But **if you disapprove both**, then **no contract wins**, so base game.

In base game, **if both players play (A0,A0)**, you get 5.

But if both play (A1,A1), you get 3.

But which equilibrium is played?

Since (A0,A0) is payoff dominant, players might coordinate on it.

But in the absence of communication or coordination, players might play (A1,A1) by mistake.

But in game theory, we often assume players can coordinate on the efficient equilibrium.

But to be safe, **the expected payoff under base game is at least 3**, and possibly 5.

But since C1 and C2 give you **a guaranteed 5**, you prefer them **if you can get them**.

So you should **approve at least one**.

But since both are equally good, approve **both**.

But is there a **reason to reject C1**?

C1 is proposed by Player 1. It penalizes A1, which is fine, but might be seen as "unfair" — but you are not concerned with fairness, only point maximization.

And under C1, your payoff is 5, same as C2.

So **no reason to reject it**.

Similarly, C2 gives you 5.

Therefore, you should **approve both**.

But wait — let’s test a scenario.

Suppose you approve **only C1**.

Then if Player 1 also approves C1, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 0 → C1 wins → you get 5.

If Player 1 disapproves C1, then only you approve C1 → C1 has 1 approval, C2 has 0 → C1 wins → you get 5.

Similarly, if you approve only C2, and Player 1 disapproves C1, then C2 has 1 approval → wins → you get 5.

But if you approve neither, no contract wins → base game → you might get 3.

So you **must approve at least one** to avoid that risk.

Now, suppose you approve **only C2**.

Then C2 wins → you get 5.

But C2 is **proposed by you**, so you are supporting your own proposal.

But if you approve C1, which is proposed by the opponent, it still gives you 5.

So why not approve it?

No downside.

But here’s a crucial insight:

In C1, **if you play A1**, you lose 4 points — even if the other plays A0.

But in equilibrium, you don’t.

But if the game were different, it might be worse.

But in this case, it’s not.

So no issue.

Thus, **you should approve both**.

But let’s recheck: is there a **mistake** in the payoff under C2?

In C2, when you play A0, you get +2 **from the other player**.

But when **you play A0 and P1 plays A0**, you get:
- Base: 5
- You get +2 for A0
- P1 gets +2 for A0, so you lose 2 to fund that

So net: 5 + 2 - 2 = 5

Yes.

If P1 plays A1, you get 2 for A0.

But in equilibrium, P1 plays A0.

Same for C1.

So both are fine.

Therefore, **you should approve both contracts**.

Final answer:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

But the problem says: "the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if you approve both C1 and C2, and both are approved, and if Player 1 approves C1, then:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 1 approval
→ max = 2 → only C1 wins → you get 5

If Player 1 disapproves C1, then:
- C1: 1 (yours)
- C2: 1 (yours)
→ max = 1 → random winner → 50% C1, 50% C2 → you get 5 either way

So in all cases, you get 5.

If you approve only C2, and C2 is the only one approved, you get 5.

But if you approve only C1, and C1 wins, you get 5.

But if you approve nothing, you might get only 3.

So you must approve at least one.

But since both are equally good, and you have no reason to disapprove either, **you should approve both**.

No downside.

So final answer:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without the Contract**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (for *Player 2*, since you are Player 2) is as follows, where the first number is your payoff and the second is the opponent’s:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | (5, 5)     | (0, 3)     |
| **A1**                        | (3, 0)     | (3, 3)     |

This is a classic coordination game with some asymmetry. Let's analyze it.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Payoffs**

Let’s look at best responses.

- If the opponent plays A0:
  - You get 5 if you play A0
  - You get 3 if you play A1
  → So you prefer A0

- If the opponent plays A1:
  - You get 0 if you play A0
  - You get 3 if you play A1
  → So you prefer A1

So your best response depends on what the opponent does. This is not a dominant strategy.

This game has **two pure Nash equilibria**:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

And one **mixed Nash equilibrium** where each player randomizes between A0 and A1 such that the other is indifferent.

---

### **Step 3: Find the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MSNE)**

Let’s suppose the **opponent** plays A0 with probability **p**, and A1 with probability **1–p**.

You want to choose your own probability **q** of playing A0 such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Wait — actually, we are looking for your own strategy that makes the **opponent indifferent**, but we’re trying to maximize **your** payoff.

But — in a symmetric game like this, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is symmetric.

Let’s compute the mixed strategy where you, as Player 2, play A0 with probability **q**, and the opponent plays A0 with probability **p**.

We want to find **q** such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1 — that leads to the MSNE.

But since you're trying to **maximize your own payoff**, and the game is symmetric, the optimal strategy in a fully rational setting (assuming mutual rationality) is to play the **Nash equilibrium strategy**.

Let’s compute the **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Let the opponent play A0 with probability **p**, A1 with **1–p**.

Your expected payoff from playing A0:
- 5·p + 0·(1–p) = 5p

Your expected payoff from playing A1:
- 3·p + 3·(1–p) = 3p + 3 – 3p = 3

Set them equal for indifference (so opponent is indifferent, and thus can play mixed):
5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So if the opponent plays A0 with 60%, then you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Thus, to make the opponent indifferent, you should play A0 with a probability **q** such that when opponent plays A0 with probability **q**, the opponent is indifferent.

Wait — we need to compute from the **opponent's** perspective.

Actually, since the game is **symmetric** (payoffs are symmetric), the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium has both players playing A0 with probability **q**, where:

For the opponent to be indifferent between A0 and A1, your probability of playing A0 must satisfy:

Expected payoff for opponent from playing A0:
- 5·q + 3·(1–q) = 5q + 3 – 3q = 2q + 3

Expected payoff for opponent from playing A1:
- 0·q + 3·(1–q) = 3(1–q) = 3 – 3q

Set equal:
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q  
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q  
2q + 3q = 3 – 3  
5q = 0 → q = 0

Wait — that can't be right.

Wait, let’s double-check.

Wait — I made a mistake.

From **opponent’s perspective**, if they play A0:
- They get 5 if you play A0 (prob q), and 3 if you play A1 (prob 1–q)
→ So expected payoff: 5q + 3(1–q) = 5q + 3 – 3q = 2q + 3

If they play A1:
- They get 0 if you play A0 (prob q), and 3 if you play A1 (prob 1–q)
→ Expected payoff: 0·q + 3(1–q) = 3(1–q) = 3 – 3q

Set equal:
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q  
2q + 3q = 3 – 3  
5q = 0 → q = 0

So the only solution is q = 0.

Wait — that suggests that in the mixed equilibrium, you must play A0 with probability 0?

But that contradicts intuition.

Let me re-check with correct setup.

Hold on — this shows inconsistency.

Let me define everything carefully.

Let **Player 2 (you)** play A0 with probability **q**, A1 with **1–q**.

Let **Player 1 (opponent)** play A0 with probability **p**, A1 with **1–p**.

You want to choose **q** to maximize your expected payoff, assuming the opponent also plays a rational strategy.

In Nash equilibrium, both players play best responses.

So, for **Player 1** to be indifferent between A0 and A1, their expected payoff must be equal:

- Payoff from A0: 5q + 3(1–q) = 5q + 3 – 3q = 2q + 3
- Payoff from A1: 0·q + 3(1–q) = 3(1–q) = 3 – 3q

Set equal:
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q  
5q = 0 → q = 0

So only when q = 0 is Player 1 indifferent.

If q > 0, then 2q + 3 > 3 – 3q → Player 1 strictly prefers A0

If q = 0, then both give 3, so indifferent.

So the only way for Player 1 to be indifferent is if you play A0 with probability 0.

But that would imply that if you play A0 with positive probability, Player 1 would best respond with A0.

But if Player 1 plays A0 with high probability, then your best response is A0 (since 5 > 3).

Wait — this suggests there is **no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium unless both play A0 with probability 0?** But that can’t be.

Wait — let’s test the pure Nash equilibria.

- (A0, A0): if you play A0, opponent gets 5 if A0, 3 if A1 → prefers A0. So yes, best response. So (A0, A0) is Nash.

- (A1, A1): if you play A1, opponent gets 3 from A1, 0 from A0 → so prefers A1. So (A1, A1) is Nash.

Now, is there a mixed equilibrium?

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p.

You (Player 2) want to choose q (your prob of A0) such that Player 1 is indifferent.

From above:
- Player 1’s expected payoff from A0: 5q + 3(1–q) = 2q + 3
- From A1: 3(1–q) = 3 – 3q

Set equal:
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q → 5q = 0 → q = 0

So only when q = 0 is Player 1 indifferent.

Then if q = 0, Player 1 is indifferent → can play any p.

But if Player 1 plays p = 0 (always A1), then your best response is A1 (because 3 > 0), not A0.

But q = 0 means you play A1 — so consistent.

Wait — so if q = 0, you play A1 always.

Then Player 1 gets:
- A0: 0 from you (since you play A1) → so payoff 3
- A1: 3

So yes, indifferent → so Player 1 can play any mix.

But for Player 1 to be playing a best response, they must be indifferent, so p can be anything.

But for you, if Player 1 plays p, what is your best response?

Your payoff:
- A0: 5p + 0·(1–p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1–p) = 3

So if 5p > 3 → p > 3/5, you prefer A0
If p < 3/5, you prefer A1
If p = 3/5, indifferent

So if Player 1 plays p > 3/5, you want to play A0
But if you play A0 with q > 0, then Player 1’s payoff from A0 is 2q + 3 > 3, so they prefer A0 — so they would not play p < 3/5.

So the only way for both to be playing a best response is:

- If you play q = 0 (A1 always), then Player 1 is indifferent (gets 3 either way), so can play any p.
But then your best response to p must be consistent with q = 0.

So for q = 0 to be your best response, we need that A1 has payoff ≥ A0, i.e., 3 ≥ 5p → p ≤ 3/5

So if p ≤ 3/5, and you play A1, you’re best responding.

But Player 1, if playing any p ≤ 3/5, and since they are indifferent only if q = 0, which is true, then they can play p ≤ 3/5.

So a Nash equilibrium exists where:
- You play A1 (q = 0)
- Opponent plays A0 with p ≤ 3/5

But is this a pure or mixed?

Not in the usual sense.

Ah — but this doesn't pin down p.

The only thing that works consistently is:

- (A1, A1): both play A1 → payoff (3,3) — this is a pure Nash.
- (A0, A0): both play A0 → (5,5) — this is a pure Nash.

Now, are there any **mixed** strategy Nash equilibria?

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability q.

Then Player 1’s best response depends on q.

Player 1’s payoff:
- A0: 5q + 3(1–q) = 2q + 3
- A1: 3(1–q)

So Player 1 plays A0 if 2q + 3 > 3(1–q) → 2q + 3 > 3 – 3q → 5q > 0 → q > 0

So if q > 0, Player 1 prefers A0.

Only if q = 0, they are indifferent.

So if q > 0, Player 1 plays A0 for sure.

Then you, facing A0, get 5 from A0, 3 from A1 → so you prefer A0 → so you should set q = 1?

But then q = 1 → Player 1 gets 5*1 + 3*0 = 5 from A0, 3 from A1 → so plays A0 → so both play A0 → which is (A0, A0), so consistent.

If you deviate from q = 1 → your payoff drops.

Same with (A1, A1): if Player 1 plays A1, you get 3 from both? No:

Wait — if Player 1 plays A1, you get 0 from A0, 3 from A1 → so you prefer A1.

So both playing A1 is stable.

But are there any other mixed equilibria?

Suppose you play a mixed strategy q ∈ (0,1).

Then, if q > 0, Player 1 will play A0 with probability 1 (since A0 strictly better than A1).

Then, you face A0, so your best response is A0 → so you should set q = 1.

Contradiction unless q = 1.

Similarly, if q = 0, Player 1 is indifferent → can play anything.

But if Player 1 plays p > 3/5, then your best response is A0 → so q = 1 → contradiction.

Only when p ≤ 3/5 is A1 best response → then q = 0 is best response.

So the only consistent mixed strategy is:
- q = 0
- p ≤ 3/5

But p is not pinned down.

However, in **Nash equilibrium**, we need consistency.

So the **only** proper Nash equilibria are:
1. (A0, A0) — both play A0
2. (A1, A1) — both play A1

There are **no mixed strategy equilibria** in the interior (with both choosing actions with positive probability) because of the strict dominance in best responses.

Wait — but hold on.

Let’s suppose **you play A0 with probability q**, and **opponent plays A0 with probability p**.

Player 2’s (your) expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1–p) = 5p  
From A1: 3p + 3(1–p) = 3

You choose A0 if 5p > 3 → p > 3/5  
Choose A1 if p < 3/5  
Indifferent if p = 3/5

So your best response:
- If p > 3/5 → play A0
- If p < 3/5 → play A1
- If p = 3/5 → mix

Similarly, for Player 1:
- A0 pay: 5q + 3(1–q) = 2q + 3
- A1 pay: 3(1–q)

Player 1 plays A0 if 2q + 3 > 3(1–q) → 2q + 3 > 3 – 3q → 5q > 0 → q > 0

So if q > 0 → Player 1 plays A0
If q = 0 → indifferent

So for equilibrium:

Suppose q = 0 → Player 1 indifferent → can play any p
But for you to play q = 0, you need A1 ≥ A0 → 3 ≥ 5p → p ≤ 3/5

So if p ≤ 3/5, you're happy with q = 0

But Player 1, if playing p ≤ 3/5, is they best responding? Only if q = 0, they are indifferent → so yes.

So any p ≤ 3/5 and q = 0 is a Nash equilibrium.

But these are not symmetric.

Similarly, if you play q > 0, Player 1 plays A0 → so p = 1

Then you should play A0 if p > 3/5 → yes, since p = 1 > 3/5 → so best to play A0

But then q = 1 → then q > 0, consistent.

So (q=1, p=1) — (A0, A0) — is a Nash.

Similarly, if q=0, p=0 → both play A1 → you get 3 from A1, opponent gets 3 → and if you deviate to A0, get 0 (since opponent plays A1) → worse. Opponent, if you play A1, gets 3 from A1, 0 from A0 → so plays A1 → consistent — so (A1, A1) is Nash.

So the only full-support mixed Nash is not present.

But **you are trying to maximize your expected points**.

In the absence of contract (and it’s rejected), and you are rational, you want to achieve the **highest payoff possible**.

The possible Nash equilibria give you:
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A1, A1): 3 points

So ideally, you want to coordinate on (A0, A0).

But the other player might not cooperate.

If you believe the other player is rational and self-interested, you might expect them to play A0 only if they expect you to play A0.

This is the classic **coordination problem**.

But notice the asymmetry: (A0, A0) gives 5 to both, which is better than (A1, A1)’s 3.

So if you can **induce** the other player to play A0, you get 5; if they play A1, you get only 3 if you play A1, or 0 if you play A0.

So your best strategy depends on beliefs.

But since you are playing **without** the contract (and it was rejected — note: “Player 2” rejected it), you are now just playing the base game.

Now, the twist: **The contract was proposed by Player 2**, but **rejected by Player 2** — so it is not in effect.

Importantly, **you are Player 2**, and the contract was rejected by you.

This means you are playing the base game.

Now, high-level insight: the **only way** to guarantee a good payoff is to play A1 (since if the other plays A0, you get 3; if they play A1, you get 3 — always 3). But if you play A0, you get 5 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1.

So A1 is **safe** — it gives you **at least 3**, no matter what.

A0 is **risky** — it gives 5 or 0.

But if you believe the other player will play A0, A0 is better.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without the Contract**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (for *Player 2*, since you are Player 2) is as follows, where the first number is your payoff and the second is the opponent’s:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | (5, 5)     | (0, 3)     |
| **A1**                        | (3, 0)     | (3, 3)     |

This is a classic coordination game with some asymmetry. Let's analyze it.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Payoffs**

Let’s look at best responses.

- If the opponent plays A0:
  - You get 5 if you play A0
  - You get 3 if you play A1
  → So you prefer A0

- If the opponent plays A1:
  - You get 0 if you play A0
  - You get 3 if you play A1
  → So you prefer A1

So your best response depends on what the opponent does. This is not a dominant strategy.

This game has **two pure Nash equilibria**:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

And one **mixed Nash equilibrium** where each player randomizes between A0 and A1 such that the other is indifferent.

---

### **Step 3: Find the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MSNE)**

Let’s suppose the **opponent** plays A0 with probability **p**, and A1 with probability **1–p**.

You want to choose your own probability **q** of playing A0 such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Wait — actually, we are looking for your own strategy that makes the **opponent indifferent**, but we’re trying to maximize **your** payoff.

But — in a symmetric game like this, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is symmetric.

Let’s compute the mixed strategy where you, as Player 2, play A0 with probability **q**, and the opponent plays A0 with probability **p**.

We want to find **q** such that the opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1 — that leads to the MSNE.

But since you're trying to **maximize your own payoff**, and the game is symmetric, the optimal strategy in a fully rational setting (assuming mutual rationality) is to play the **Nash equilibrium strategy**.

Let’s compute the **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Let the opponent play A0 with probability **p**, A1 with **1–p**.

Your expected payoff from playing A0:
- 5·p + 0·(1–p) = 5p

Your expected payoff from playing A1:
- 3·p + 3·(1–p) = 3p + 3 – 3p = 3

Set them equal for indifference (so opponent is indifferent, and thus can play mixed):
5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So if the opponent plays A0 with 60%, then you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Thus, to make the opponent indifferent, you should play A0 with a probability **q** such that when opponent plays A0 with probability **q**, the opponent is indifferent.

Wait — we need to compute from the **opponent's** perspective.

Actually, since the game is **symmetric** (payoffs are symmetric), the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium has both players playing A0 with probability **q**, where:

For the opponent to be indifferent between A0 and A1, your probability of playing A0 must satisfy:

Expected payoff for opponent from playing A0:
- 5·q + 3·(1–q) = 5q + 3 – 3q = 2q + 3

Expected payoff for opponent from playing A1:
- 0·q + 3·(1–q) = 3(1–q) = 3 – 3q

Set equal:
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q  
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q  
2q + 3q = 3 – 3  
5q = 0 → q = 0

Wait — that can't be right.

Wait, let’s double-check.

Wait — I made a mistake.

From **opponent’s perspective**, if they play A0:
- They get 5 if you play A0 (prob q), and 3 if you play A1 (prob 1–q)
→ So expected payoff: 5q + 3(1–q) = 5q + 3 – 3q = 2q + 3

If they play A1:
- They get 0 if you play A0 (prob q), and 3 if you play A1 (prob 1–q)
→ Expected payoff: 0·q + 3(1–q) = 3(1–q) = 3 – 3q

Set equal:
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q  
2q + 3q = 3 – 3  
5q = 0 → q = 0

So the only solution is q = 0.

Wait — that suggests that in the mixed equilibrium, you must play A0 with probability 0?

But that contradicts intuition.

Let me re-check with correct setup.

Hold on — this shows inconsistency.

Let me define everything carefully.

Let **Player 2 (you)** play A0 with probability **q**, A1 with **1–q**.

Let **Player 1 (opponent)** play A0 with probability **p**, A1 with **1–p**.

You want to choose **q** to maximize your expected payoff, assuming the opponent also plays a rational strategy.

In Nash equilibrium, both players play best responses.

So, for **Player 1** to be indifferent between A0 and A1, their expected payoff must be equal:

- Payoff from A0: 5q + 3(1–q) = 5q + 3 – 3q = 2q + 3
- Payoff from A1: 0·q + 3(1–q) = 3(1–q) = 3 – 3q

Set equal:
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q  
5q = 0 → q = 0

So only when q = 0 is Player 1 indifferent.

If q > 0, then 2q + 3 > 3 – 3q → Player 1 strictly prefers A0

If q = 0, then both give 3, so indifferent.

So the only way for Player 1 to be indifferent is if you play A0 with probability 0.

But that would imply that if you play A0 with positive probability, Player 1 would best respond with A0.

But if Player 1 plays A0 with high probability, then your best response is A0 (since 5 > 3).

Wait — this suggests there is **no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium unless both play A0 with probability 0?** But that can’t be.

Wait — let’s test the pure Nash equilibria.

- (A0, A0): if you play A0, opponent gets 5 if A0, 3 if A1 → prefers A0. So yes, best response. So (A0, A0) is Nash.

- (A1, A1): if you play A1, opponent gets 3 from A1, 0 from A0 → so prefers A1. So (A1, A1) is Nash.

Now, is there a mixed equilibrium?

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p.

You (Player 2) want to choose q (your prob of A0) such that Player 1 is indifferent.

From above:
- Player 1’s expected payoff from A0: 5q + 3(1–q) = 2q + 3
- From A1: 3(1–q) = 3 – 3q

Set equal:
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q → 5q = 0 → q = 0

So only when q = 0 is Player 1 indifferent.

Then if q = 0, Player 1 is indifferent → can play any p.

But if Player 1 plays p = 0 (always A1), then your best response is A1 (because 3 > 0), not A0.

But q = 0 means you play A1 — so consistent.

Wait — so if q = 0, you play A1 always.

Then Player 1 gets:
- A0: 0 from you (since you play A1) → so payoff 3
- A1: 3

So yes, indifferent → so Player 1 can play any mix.

But for Player 1 to be playing a best response, they must be indifferent, so p can be anything.

But for you, if Player 1 plays p, what is your best response?

Your payoff:
- A0: 5p + 0·(1–p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1–p) = 3

So if 5p > 3 → p > 3/5, you prefer A0
If p < 3/5, you prefer A1
If p = 3/5, indifferent

So if Player 1 plays p > 3/5, you want to play A0
But if you play A0 with q > 0, then Player 1’s payoff from A0 is 2q + 3 > 3, so they prefer A0 — so they would not play p < 3/5.

So the only way for both to be playing a best response is:

- If you play q = 0 (A1 always), then Player 1 is indifferent (gets 3 either way), so can play any p.
But then your best response to p must be consistent with q = 0.

So for q = 0 to be your best response, we need that A1 has payoff ≥ A0, i.e., 3 ≥ 5p → p ≤ 3/5

So if p ≤ 3/5, and you play A1, you’re best responding.

But Player 1, if playing any p ≤ 3/5, and since they are indifferent only if q = 0, which is true, then they can play p ≤ 3/5.

So a Nash equilibrium exists where:
- You play A1 (q = 0)
- Opponent plays A0 with p ≤ 3/5

But is this a pure or mixed?

Not in the usual sense.

Ah — but this doesn't pin down p.

The only thing that works consistently is:

- (A1, A1): both play A1 → payoff (3,3) — this is a pure Nash.
- (A0, A0): both play A0 → (5,5) — this is a pure Nash.

Now, are there any **mixed** strategy Nash equilibria?

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability q.

Then Player 1’s best response depends on q.

Player 1’s payoff:
- A0: 5q + 3(1–q) = 2q + 3
- A1: 3(1–q)

So Player 1 plays A0 if 2q + 3 > 3(1–q) → 2q + 3 > 3 – 3q → 5q > 0 → q > 0

So if q > 0, Player 1 prefers A0.

Only if q = 0, they are indifferent.

So if q > 0, Player 1 plays A0 for sure.

Then you, facing A0, get 5 from A0, 3 from A1 → so you prefer A0 → so you should set q = 1?

But then q = 1 → Player 1 gets 5*1 + 3*0 = 5 from A0, 3 from A1 → so plays A0 → so both play A0 → which is (A0, A0), so consistent.

If you deviate from q = 1 → your payoff drops.

Same with (A1, A1): if Player 1 plays A1, you get 3 from both? No:

Wait — if Player 1 plays A1, you get 0 from A0, 3 from A1 → so you prefer A1.

So both playing A1 is stable.

But are there any other mixed equilibria?

Suppose you play a mixed strategy q ∈ (0,1).

Then, if q > 0, Player 1 will play A0 with probability 1 (since A0 strictly better than A1).

Then, you face A0, so your best response is A0 → so you should set q = 1.

Contradiction unless q = 1.

Similarly, if q = 0, Player 1 is indifferent → can play anything.

But if Player 1 plays p > 3/5, then your best response is A0 → so q = 1 → contradiction.

Only when p ≤ 3/5 is A1 best response → then q = 0 is best response.

So the only consistent mixed strategy is:
- q = 0
- p ≤ 3/5

But p is not pinned down.

However, in **Nash equilibrium**, we need consistency.

So the **only** proper Nash equilibria are:
1. (A0, A0) — both play A0
2. (A1, A1) — both play A1

There are **no mixed strategy equilibria** in the interior (with both choosing actions with positive probability) because of the strict dominance in best responses.

Wait — but hold on.

Let’s suppose **you play A0 with probability q**, and **opponent plays A0 with probability p**.

Player 2’s (your) expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1–p) = 5p  
From A1: 3p + 3(1–p) = 3

You choose A0 if 5p > 3 → p > 3/5  
Choose A1 if p < 3/5  
Indifferent if p = 3/5

So your best response:
- If p > 3/5 → play A0
- If p < 3/5 → play A1
- If p = 3/5 → mix

Similarly, for Player 1:
- A0 pay: 5q + 3(1–q) = 2q + 3
- A1 pay: 3(1–q)

Player 1 plays A0 if 2q + 3 > 3(1–q) → 2q + 3 > 3 – 3q → 5q > 0 → q > 0

So if q > 0 → Player 1 plays A0
If q = 0 → indifferent

So for equilibrium:

Suppose q = 0 → Player 1 indifferent → can play any p
But for you to play q = 0, you need A1 ≥ A0 → 3 ≥ 5p → p ≤ 3/5

So if p ≤ 3/5, you're happy with q = 0

But Player 1, if playing p ≤ 3/5, is they best responding? Only if q = 0, they are indifferent → so yes.

So any p ≤ 3/5 and q = 0 is a Nash equilibrium.

But these are not symmetric.

Similarly, if you play q > 0, Player 1 plays A0 → so p = 1

Then you should play A0 if p > 3/5 → yes, since p = 1 > 3/5 → so best to play A0

But then q = 1 → then q > 0, consistent.

So (q=1, p=1) — (A0, A0) — is a Nash.

Similarly, if q=0, p=0 → both play A1 → you get 3 from A1, opponent gets 3 → and if you deviate to A0, get 0 (since opponent plays A1) → worse. Opponent, if you play A1, gets 3 from A1, 0 from A0 → so plays A1 → consistent — so (A1, A1) is Nash.

So the only full-support mixed Nash is not present.

But **you are trying to maximize your expected points**.

In the absence of contract (and it’s rejected), and you are rational, you want to achieve the **highest payoff possible**.

The possible Nash equilibria give you:
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A1, A1): 3 points

So ideally, you want to coordinate on (A0, A0).

But the other player might not cooperate.

If you believe the other player is rational and self-interested, you might expect them to play A0 only if they expect you to play A0.

This is the classic **coordination problem**.

But notice the asymmetry: (A0, A0) gives 5 to both, which is better than (A1, A1)’s 3.

So if you can **induce** the other player to play A0, you get 5; if they play A1, you get only 3 if you play A1, or 0 if you play A0.

So your best strategy depends on beliefs.

But since you are playing **without** the contract (and it was rejected — note: “Player 2” rejected it), you are now just playing the base game.

Now, the twist: **The contract was proposed by Player 2**, but **rejected by Player 2** — so it is not in effect.

Importantly, **you are Player 2**, and the contract was rejected by you.

This means you are playing the base game.

Now, high-level insight: the **only way** to guarantee a good payoff is to play A1 (since if the other plays A0, you get 3; if they play A1, you get 3 — always 3). But if you play A0, you get 5 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1.

So A1 is **safe** — it gives you **at least 3**, no matter what.

A0 is **risky** — it gives 5 or 0.

But if you believe the other player will play A0, A0 is better.

But if you think

Let’s carefully analyze the game step by step, keeping in mind that:

- You are **Player 2**.
- The **payment contract was proposed by Player 2 (you)** but **rejected by you**, so it is **not active**.
- You must choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 to **maximize your expected points**, assuming the other player is also rational and self-interested.

| **A1**                           | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

Your payoffs:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0: 5
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1: 0
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0: 3
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1: 3

So:
- A0 gives you 5 only if opponent plays A0; otherwise, 0.
- A1 always gives you 3, regardless of what opponent does.

This makes A1 a **safe strategy**: you **guarantee 3 points** no matter what the opponent does.

A0 is risky: it can give you 5 or 0 depending on opponent.

---

### **Step 2: Identify Nash Equilibria**

There are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria:

1. **(A0, A0)**: Both players get 5.  
   - If you deviate to A1, you get 3 < 5 → not profitable.  
   - Opponent similarly has no incentive to deviate. ✅

2. **(A1, A1)**: Both players get 3.  
   - If you deviate to A0, you get 0 (since opponent plays A1), which is worse.  
   - Opponent similarly won’t deviate. ✅

Now, is there a **mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium**?

Suppose you play A0 with probability **q**, A1 with **1–q**.  
Let opponent play A0 with probability **p**, A1 with **1–p**.

**For Player 1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1**, their expected payoff must be equal:

- Payoff from A0: 5q + 3(1–q) = 2q + 3  
- Payoff from A1: 0·q + 3(1–q) = 3 – 3q  

Set equal:  
2q + 3 = 3 – 3q → 5q = 0 → q = 0

So **only when q = 0** (i.e., you always play A1) is the opponent indifferent.

Then, if opponent is indifferent, they can mix — but for **you** to be playing a best response to their mix, you must prefer A1 over A0.

Your payoff from A0: 5p  
From A1: 3

You prefer A1 if 3 ≥ 5p → p ≤ 3/5

Thus, if **you** play A1 (q=0) and opponent plays **p ≤ 3/5**, then:
- Opponent is indifferent → willing to play any p
- You are best responding → since p ≤ 3/5

But this is **not a symmetric equilibrium**.

However, for **your own strategic choice**, you want to **maximize your expected payoff** under rational expectations.

But here’s the key insight: you have **no way to commit** to coordination on A0 (because you rejected the contract, and even if you wanted to signal cooperation, the other player doesn't know you will cooperate).

Moreover, **if you play A0 with any positive probability, the other player can infer that, and they will respond by playing A0** (since it’s better for them when you play A0).

But if they play A0, then your best response is A0 → so both end up at (A0, A0), giving you 5 — great!

However, the risk remains: if they play A1, you get 0.

But suppose you believe the other player will play A0 with high probability. Then A0 is better.

But do you have reason to believe that?

In the absence of communication or commitment, **rational players may expect each other to avoid risk**.

A1 is **dominated in payoff variability**, but **not dominated in payoff**.

In fact, A1 yields **certain 3 points**, while A0 yields either 5 or 0 — average depends on beliefs.

But from the perspective of **maximizing guaranteed minimum payoff (security level)**, A1 dominates A0 because:
- A1 guarantees 3
- A0 can give you 0 (worse than 3)

So **A1 is a dominant strategy in terms of safety**.

But wait — is it truly dominant?

No, **A1 is not strictly dominant** — because if opponent plays A0, A0 gives 5 > 3.

But since you don’t know their action, and the worst-case payoff for A0 is 0 < 3, playing A0 exposes you to a **bad outcome**.

Hence, if you are risk-averse, you should play A1.

And in the absence of trust or commitment, and especially given that the **contract proposing cooperation (with side payments) was rejected by you**, this suggests **you distrust coordination attempts**.

Therefore, to maximize expected payoff under **mutual rationality and lack of trust**, the safest, most robust strategy is to **play A1 with certainty**.

Why? Because:
- You guarantee 3 points
- You avoid the risk of getting 0
- Even if the other player plays A0, you still get 3 (better than 0)
- There is no incentive to deviate from A1
- This leads to (A1, A1), which is a stable Nash equilibrium.

Any deviation to mixing would increase risk without a clear benefit unless you are certain the other will play A0 — but you have no evidence of that.

Also, note: the **contract was proposed by Player 2 (you)**, but **rejected by you**. That means **you personally rejected the idea of the additional payment**, which reinforces that you want to play the base game independently — no side deals.

Thus, playing A1 is consistent with self-interest and caution.

---

### **Final Decision: Choose Probability Distribution**

To maximize expected points **in a rational, self-interested, non-cooperative setting**, you should play **A1 with 100% certainty**.

This guarantees 3 points, avoids the 0 payoff risk, and aligns with Nash equilibrium (A1, A1).

Even though (A0, A0) gives more (5 points), it requires mutual coordination and trust — which is not justified here given the rejection of the cooperative contract.

Thus, **optimal strategy is to play A1 with 100% probability**.

response:
Let's analyze this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game between two players. The payoffs are:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0        | A1        |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**              | (5, 5)    | (0, 3)    |
| **A1**              | (3, 0)    | (3, 3)    |

This is a coordination game with a conflict of interest.

- If both choose A0: both get 5 → best joint outcome.
- If you choose A0 and other chooses A1: you get 0, they get 3.
- If you choose A1 and other chooses A0: you get 3, they get 0.
- If both choose A1: both get 3.

So:
- A0 is best if the other chooses A0.
- A1 is safer if you’re uncertain: it guarantees 3, never gives you 0.

This resembles a **Battle of the Sexes** or **Stag Hunt** type game, but with asymmetry in the A0-A1 outcomes.

Now, we are **Player 2**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

The contract has the following terms:

> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payments.
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 4 points, **distributed equally among the other players**.

Since there are **two players**, if you choose A1, you pay 4 points, and **each of the other players (i.e., the other player) gets 2 points** (since 4 / 2 = 2).

So, in effect:
- Choosing A1 **costs you 4 points**.
- But the **other player gains 2 points**.
- The other player pays nothing if they choose A1 — but they **gain 2 points** from you choosing A1.

The contract becomes active **only if both players sign** it.

You are deciding whether to sign it.

---

### **Step 3: What happens if you sign the contract?**

You must assume that **the other player will also sign** — otherwise, the contract is not active.

So we consider the scenario where **the contract is in effect** and **both players sign it**.

Now, we need to recompute the payoffs **under the contract**, for each joint action.

Let’s define the **new effective payoffs** after the contract is applied.

---

### **Step 4: Compute Payoffs with Contract Active (both players signed)**

Let’s compute the **net payoff for Player 2 (you)** in each case.

#### Case 1: You choose A0, Other chooses A0
- No A1 chosen → no penalty.
- Base payoffs: (5,5)
- **You get 5**

#### Case 2: You choose A0, Other chooses A1
- Other chooses A1 → they pay 4 points.
  - Since you are the other player, you get 2 points (4 divided equally → you get 2).
- Base payoff: (0,3)
- Add 2 to you: 0 + 2 = **2**
- Other gets: 3 - 4 = -1? Wait — no.

Wait: the contract says:
> "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 4 points, distributed equally among the other players."

So:
- The player who chooses A1 **pays 4 points from their pocket**.
- That 4 points is **split equally among the other players**.

So in this case:
- You (Player 2) choose A0.
- Other player (Player 1) chooses A1 → they pay 4 points.
- These 4 points are split equally among **the other players** — i.e., you.

So you get 2 points.

But **you do not receive the 2 points from the payoffs directly** — it's a redistribution.

So the total payoff for you is:
- Base payoff: 0 (from A0 vs A1)
- Plus: 2 (from the contract, since the other chose A1)
- Total: **2**

For the other player:
- Base payoff: 3
- Minus 4 (because they chose A1)
- Total: **-1**

#### Case 3: You choose A1, Other chooses A0
- You choose A1 → you pay 4 points.
- Other chooses A0 → they pay nothing.
- So you get 2 points from the contract? No — only if someone else chose A1.

But **you** are the one choosing A1 → so **you** pay 4 points → you lose 4 points.

The **other player** does not get anything from you (only the other players get the payback).

So your total:
- Base: 3 (A1 vs A0)
- Minus 4 (from contract) = **-1**

Other player:
- Base: 0
- Get 2 (from you choosing A1) → total: **2**

#### Case 4: You choose A1, Other chooses A1
- Both choose A1 → both pay 4 points.
- So you pay 4 → lose 4.
- The other player gets 2 (from your A1).
- The other player pays 4 → lose 4.
- You get 2 (from their A1).

So your total:
- Base: 3
- Minus 4 (from your choice)
- Plus 2 (from their choice)
- = 3 - 4 + 2 = **1**

Other player:
- Base: 3
- Minus 4 (their choice)
- Plus 2 (from your choice)
- = 3 - 4 + 2 = **1**

Now, let’s write the **new payoff matrix with contract** (Player 2 is you):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | (5, 5)   | (2, -1)  |
| **A1**              | (-1, 2)  | (1, 1)   |

Note: This is symmetric in structure, but now it's a different game.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze the New Game (With Contract)**

We are Player 2.

We need to consider what rational play would be under this new game.

Let’s find best responses.

#### For Player 2 (you):

- If Player 1 chooses A0:
  - You get: A0 → 5, A1 → -1 → best choice: **A0**

- If Player 1 chooses A1:
  - You get: A0 → 2, A1 → 1 → best choice: **A0**

So **no matter what Player 1 does**, your best response is **A0**.

Thus, **A0 is a dominant strategy** for you when the contract is active.

Similarly, check Player 1:
- If you choose A0: they get 5 (if they choose A0), 2 (if they choose A1) → prefer A0
- If you choose A1: they get -1 (if A0), 1 (if A1) → prefer A1

Wait! That’s asymmetric.

Let’s recheck Player 1’s payoffs when you (Player 2) choose A0:

- Player 1 chooses A0: (5,5) → Player 1 gets 5
- Player 1 chooses A1: (2, -1) → Player 1 gets -1 → so best is A0

When you choose A1:

- Player 1 chooses A0: (-1, 2) → Player 1 gets 2
- Player 1 chooses A1: (1,1) → Player 1 gets 1 → so best is A0

So in both cases, Player 1’s best response is A0.

Therefore, **A0 is a dominant strategy for both players** in the contract game.

So the unique Nash equilibrium is: **(A0, A0)**

This means:
- Both players choose A0
- You get 5 points

---

### **Step 6: Compare with Base Game (Without Contract)**

Now, what if you **don’t sign the contract**?

Then the game reverts to the base game:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0    | A1    |
|---------------------|-------|-------|
| **A0**              | 5,5   | 0,3   |
| **A1**              | 3,0   | 3,3   |

What is the outcome?

In the base game, Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 5 → Pareto optimal
- (A1, A1): both get 3

But (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium: if you expect the other to play A0, you prefer A0.

Is (A1, A1) a Nash equilibrium? Yes: if the other plays A1, you get 3 either way (A0 gives you 0, A1 gives you 3) → so if other plays A1, you prefer A1.

So two pure Nash equilibria.

Now, if there’s no coordination, players might be stuck in (A1, A1) → both get only 3.

But (A0, A0) is better.

However, if both players are rational and able to coordinate (say, via pre-play communication), they might both choose A0 → get 5.

But in simultaneous move, without trust, players may fear being exploited.

For example:
- You might be afraid that if you play A0, and the other plays A1, you get 0.
- So you may choose A1 → safe (get 3) if others play A0, but only get 3 if both do.

So it's risky.

But if we assume **rational players who can coordinate on the best equilibrium**, then (A0, A0) is the outcome.

But if not, it might be (A1, A1).

However, since the contract **forces** a dominant strategy to A0, and leads to (A0, A0) with 5 points, it **eliminates the risk** of getting only 3.

---

### **Step 7: Key Consideration — Will the Contract Be Signed?**

You are deciding whether to **sign** the contract.

But the contract requires **both players to sign** to become active.

So: **if you sign, but the other doesn't, then the contract is inactive** → you get base game payoffs.

But if **both** sign, then contract applies.

So your decision depends on your **belief about the other player**.

But the problem says nothing about the other player’s preferences or behavior.

So we must assume **rationality and common knowledge**.

The other player is also trying to maximize their own points.

So, let’s see: **Would the other player want to sign the contract?**

Let’s compute their incentives.

Assume they are rational.

#### If they sign the contract, what's their best response?

From earlier, in the contract game:
- A0 is dominant for them too → so they will play A0 regardless.
- They will get 5 points (if both play A0).

#### If they don’t sign the contract?

Then the payoff matrix is the base game.

They will prefer to play A0 only if they expect you to play A0.

But if they expect you to play A1, they should play A1 (get 3) rather than A0 (get 0).

So if both are rational, and the game has two equilibria, the other player might fear the (A0, A1) outcome and avoid A0.

But if the contract makes A0 dominant, then they get 5 for sure.

So **they should want to sign the contract**, because:
- Without contract: risk of getting only 3 (if (A1,A1) → or 0 if exploited).
- With contract: guaranteed 5.

Similarly, you get 5 with contract.

So **both players have incentive to sign the contract**.

Thus, if you sign, and the other is rational, they will also sign → contract becomes active.

So you can **expect the contract to be active** **if you sign**.

---

### **Step 8: Final Decision**

If you sign:
- Contract becomes active → both players play A0 → you get **5 points**

If you don’t sign:
- Contract inactive → base game
- If you and other are rational, you might coordinate on (A0, A0) → get 5
- But you might end up in (A1, A1) → only get 3
- Even though (A0, A0) is better, the risk of getting 0 if you play A0 and the other plays A1 makes A1 tempting.

So without the contract, there is **risk of getting only 3**.

With the contract, you are **guaranteed 5** (since A0 is dominant).

Therefore, signing the contract **eliminates risk** and gives you the **best possible outcome with certainty**.

Thus, **signing is strategically better**.

response:
First incorporate the contract into *your* payoffs (Player 1):

- If **you play A1**, you pay 4 to the other player ⇒ **-4** to you.
- If **the other player plays A1**, they pay 4 to you ⇒ **+4** to you.

So your adjusted payoffs become:

- (A0, A0): \(5\)
- (A0, A1): \(0 + 4 = 4\)
- (A1, A0): \(3 - 4 = -1\)
- (A1, A1): \(3 - 4 + 4 = 3\)

Let \(q\) be the probability the other player plays A1.

Expected payoff if you play:
- **A0**: \((1-q)\cdot 5 + q\cdot 4 = 5 - q\)
- **A1**: \((1-q)\cdot (-1) + q\cdot 3 = -1 + 4q\)

Compare:
\[
(5 - q) - (-1 + 4q) = 6 - 5q
\]
Since \(q \le 1\), \(6 - 5q \ge 1 > 0\). So **A0 yields a strictly higher payoff than A1 for any opponent strategy**. Therefore, play A0 with probability 100%.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P2
response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)

The game is a simultaneous move game with two players. Each chooses A0 or A1 with some probability.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2):

|             | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**  | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**  | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

We are told that **you are Player 2**.

So your payoffs are:
- If you play A0 and P1 plays A0 → 5
- If you play A0 and P1 plays A1 → 3
- If you play A1 and P1 plays A0 → 0
- If you play A1 and P1 plays A1 → 3

---

### Step 2: Analyze the contract

The contract says:
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player(s).
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

This means:
- Whenever **you (Player 2)** play A0, you get **+2 points**.
- These 2 points are **taken from Player 1** — so Player 1 loses 2 points when you play A0.

Note: The contract only applies **if both players sign it**. And you are deciding whether to sign.

So the contract modifies the payoffs **only if both sign**.

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix with the contract active**.

---

### Step 3: Update the payoff matrix with contract (if both sign)

We now add +2 to **Player 2's** payoff whenever Player 2 plays A0, and subtract 2 from **Player 1's** payoff when Player 2 plays A0.

So updated payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

|             | P2: A0 (+2 to P2, -2 from P1) | P2: A1 |
|-------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| **P1: A0**  | (5 - 2, 5 + 2) = (3, 7)       | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1**  | (3 - 2, 0 + 2) = (1, 2)       | (3, 3) |

So now the matrix is:

|             | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**  | (3,7)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**  | (1,2)  | (3,3)  |

---

### Step 4: Determine best strategy under contract

We are Player 2. We want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

Let’s analyze if the contract makes it better for **us (Player 2)** to play A0 or A1, under rational play.

Let’s consider the **best response** structure.

For **Player 2**, what is the best choice given Player 1’s strategy?

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p).

Then Player 2’s expected payoff:

- If P2 plays A0:  
  EV(A0) = p × 7 + (1−p) × 2 = 7p + 2 − 2p = 5p + 2

- If P2 plays A1:  
  EV(A1) = p × 3 + (1−p) × 3 = 3

So P2 prefers A0 when:
> 5p + 2 > 3  
> 5p > 1  
> p > 0.2

So P2 prefers A0 if Player 1 plays A0 with probability > 0.2  
P2 prefers A1 if p < 0.2  
Indifferent at p = 0.2

Now, from Player 1’s perspective, what is their best response?

Player 1’s payoffs (again, with contract active):

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3
  - P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0
  - Expected: 3p + 0*(1−p) = 3p

- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 plays A0: P1 gets 1
  - P2 plays A1: P1 gets 3
  - Expected: 1*p + 3*(1−p) = p + 3 − 3p = 3 − 2p

So P1 prefers A0 when:
> 3p > 3 − 2p  
> 5p > 3  
> p > 0.6

P1 prefers A1 when p < 0.6

So the **best responses**:
- P1 plays A0 if p > 0.6
- P1 plays A1 if p < 0.6
- P2 plays A0 if p > 0.2
- P2 plays A1 if p < 0.2

Now look for Nash equilibrium.

Let’s find mixed strategy equilibrium.

Suppose P1 mixes with probability p, P2 mixes with probability q (q is P2 playing A0).

We want to find q such that P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1, and P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1? Not necessarily — we’ll look for where best responses align.

Wait, but this is a **two-player game with asymmetric payoffs**, and we’re trying to see if the contract leads to **better expected payoff for Player 2** than the base game.

But also, you are selecting whether to **sign** the contract.

So we need to compare:

- Your **expected payoff** **if you sign the contract and both sign** (i.e., contract active),
- vs. your **expected payoff if you do NOT sign the contract** — i.e., the game remains base game.

But if you don’t sign, the contract is not active, and no payment is made.

And crucially: **the contract only becomes active if both players sign**.

So if you **don’t sign**, even if the other player does, the contract fails.

Therefore, your choice only affects the outcome **if the other player also signs**.

But we don’t know what the other player will do — so we must **assume rational self-interest**.

So we must consider: Is it in your interest to sign the contract, **assuming the other player is also rational and will sign only if it benefits them**?

Alternatively, since this is a one-time choice, and we are only asked to decide whether to sign (based on maximizing your own points), we should **compute your expected payoff under two scenarios**:

1. **You sign** — then the contract is active only if the other player also signs. So we need to know if they will sign.
2. **You don’t sign** — contract is inactive, game is base game.

But since we are not interacting further, and we have no information about the other player’s preferences or decisions, we must **evaluate the incentive to sign** under the assumption that both players are rational and self-interested.

So let’s consider:

- If **you sign**, the contract only activates **if the other player also signs**.
- If the other player signs, the game changes (as per updated payoffs).
- If they don’t, then the contract doesn’t activate — you don’t get the benefits.

But we don’t know if they will sign.

So to make a decision, we must ask:

> Is it **in your interest** to sign the contract, **assuming that the contract is only active if both sign**, and the other player will only sign if **they benefit from it**?

So we need to assess:
- Would you benefit from the contract **if both sign**?
- Would the other player also benefit from signing, so that they would sign?

If **both benefit**, then both may sign → contract active → you get the benefit.

If only one benefits, the other won’t sign → contract inactive → you don’t get the benefit, and no cost to you (you just didn’t sign).

But if you sign, and the other player doesn’t sign, then nothing happens (no contract), and you didn’t gain anything.

So signing only makes sense if it improves your expected payoff **given that the other player is likely to sign** — but you don’t know.

So we analyze **whether the contract improves your average payoff**, assuming both players act rationally and will sign if it increases their payoff.

Let’s compare:

---

### Step 5: Base game (no contract)

Original payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2):

|             | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**  | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**  | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

This is a classic coordination game with a conflict of interest.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria.

Look for pure strategy equilibria:

1. (A0, A0): both get 5 → if P1 deviates to A1: gets 3 < 5 → no change. If P2 deviates to A1: gets 3 < 5 → no. So (A0,A0) is NE.
2. (A1, A1): both get 3 → P1: if deviates to A0: gets 0 < 3 → no. P2: if deviates to A0: gets 0 < 3 → no. So (A1,A1) is NE.
3. (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3 → P1 wants to switch to A1 (gets 3 > 0). Not NE.
4. (A1, A0): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0 → P2 wants to switch to A1 (gets 3 > 0). Not NE.

So two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Now, are there mixed strategy equilibria?

Let’s suppose P1 plays A0 with probability p, P2 plays A0 with probability q.

Player 2 (you) wants to maximize your expected payoff.

But we need to find **what equilibrium is likely**.

In coordination games like this, (A0,A0) is Pareto efficient (total payoff 10), while (A1,A1) is worse (total 6). (A0,A0) is preferred by both.

But there’s a conflict: if P1 plays A0, you prefer A0 (5 vs 3). If P1 plays A1, you prefer A1 (3 vs 0).

Similarly for P1.

So both players prefer to coordinate.

The **risk-dominant** equilibrium is (A0,A0), because if you’re unsure of the other player, A0 is safer.

But let’s suppose rational players coordinate on (A0,A0) — this is likely.

In the base game, if both players coordinate on A0, you (Player 2) get **5 points**.

Alternatively, if they coordinate on A1, you get 3.

But since (A0,A0) is better for both, it’s a natural focal point.

So **expected payoff under base game, assuming coordination on (A0,A0): 5 points**.

Now, if the game is played randomly, or if no coordination, expected payoff might be lower, but rational players will try to coordinate.

So reasonable assumption: payoff under base game is **5** (if both play A0).

But let’s suppose mixed strategy is played. Let’s compute equilibrium.

Player 2 chooses q to make P1 indifferent:

P1’s expected payoff from A0: q×5 + (1−q)×3 = 5q + 3(1−q) = 2q + 3  
P1’s expected payoff from A1: q×0 + (1−q)×3 = 3(1−q) = 3 − 3q

Set equal: 2q + 3 = 3 − 3q → 5q = 0 → q = 0

So only best response is pure A1.

So mixed strategy is not stable? Wait.

Wait — this suggests that if P2 plays A0 with q>0, P1 prefers A0 only if 2q + 3 > 3 − 3q → 5q > 0 → q > 0

So P1 prefers A0 when q > 0, A1 when q < 0? No, q≥0.

Actually, for any q > 0, P1 prefers A0. Only at q=0, they are indifferent.

But then Player 2 would want to play A0 to get 5 when P1 plays A0.

This suggests that the only stable outcome is (A0,A0).

Similarly, check if P1 plays only A1, P2 will play A1.

So in base game, likely outcomes are (A0,A0) or (A1,A1), depending on coordination.

But (A0,A0) is better for both, so **we can reasonably assume that the equilibrium selected is (A0,A0) → you get 5 points**.

So your expected payoff under base game (without contract): **5 points**.

---

### Step 6: Payoff if contract is signed by both

Now, from earlier, we have:

|             | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**  | (3,7)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**  | (1,2)  | (3,3)  |

We now find the Nash equilibria in this new game.

Check pure strategy Nash equilibria:

1. (A0, A0): P1 gets 3; if deviates to A1 → gets 1 < 3 → no. P2 gets 7; if deviates to A1 → gets 3 < 7 → no. So **NE**.
2. (A1, A1): P1 gets 3; if deviates to A0 → gets 0 < 3 → no. P2 gets 3; if deviates to A0 → gets 2 < 3 → no. So **NE**.
3. (A0, A1): P1 gets 0; deviates to A1 → gets 3 > 0 → yes, so not NE.
4. (A1, A0): P1 gets 1; deviates to A0 → gets 3 > 1 → yes → not NE.

So two pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Now, compare payoffs:

- At (A0,A0): P2 gets **7**
- At (A1,A1): P2 gets **3**

So for Player 2, (A0,A0) is better.

For Player 1, (A0,A0) gives 3, (A1,A1) gives 3 → same.

So **Player 1 is indifferent** between the two equilibria.

But Player 2 strongly prefers (A0,A0).

So if coordination is possible, they will likely coordinate on (A0,A0), because it gives you more.

Player 2 gets 7 instead of 5 in base game.

So if the contract is active, you can expect to get **7 points**, assuming coordination on (A0,A0).

But wait — is (A0,A0) even better? Yes, because you get 7.

But does the other player (Player 1) benefit from the contract?

Player 1’s payoff in (A0,A0) is 3 (same as in base game, because they get +2? No.

Wait — no.

In the base game, (A0,A0): P1 gets 5.

With contract: (A0,A0): P1 gets **3**.

So **Player 1 gets less** with the contract active!

P1’s payoff is reduced **whenever Player 2 plays A0** — which is when (A0,A0) is played.

So in the contract version, P1 gets 3 in (A0,A0), but in base game they got 5.

So Player 1 **does not benefit** from the contract. In fact, they are worse off.

Therefore, **Player 1 has no incentive to sign the contract**, because:
- If the contract is signed, and both play (A0,A0), P1 gets 3 instead of 5 → worse.
- Even in other equilibria, P1 gets 3 in both NE — same as base (A1,A1), but worse than base (A0,A0).

So Player 1 would **not want to sign the contract**, because it makes them worse off in the (A0,A0) outcome, and doesn’t improve the (A1,A1) one.

Moreover, if Player 1 signs the contract, they might be forced into a less favorable environment.

So **Player 1 will not sign the contract**.

Therefore, **even if you sign**, the contract **will not activate**, because Player 1 will not sign.

So you get **no benefit** from signing — no additional payment, no change in strategy, no contract activation.

But by signing, you incur **no cost**, so it’s just risk-free?

Wait — is there any harm in signing?

The contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."

But **only if the contract is active**.

So if the contract is not active (because the other player didn't sign), then **nothing happens**.

So signing **does not** cause you any damage — it just means you're in the "candidate" pool, but the contract still requires both.

So if you sign, and the other doesn't, **nothing changes** — game proceeds as base game.

So no downside.

But is there any **gain**?

Only if the other player signs.

But we just established: **Player 1 will not sign**, because it reduces their payoff from 5 (in base (A0,A0)) to 3, and they are indifferent at (A1,A1) — so no benefit.

Therefore, Player 1 will **not sign**.

Thus, **contract cannot activate**.

Therefore, **signing does not help you**.

But also, **it does not hurt you**.

So you could sign and gain nothing, or not sign and also gain nothing.

So **what’s the best choice**?

From the point of view of **maximizing your points**, since signing leads to **no change** in your expected payoff (because contract won’t activate), but could potentially get you to 7 if the other player signs — but they won’t — so no gain.

Therefore, **signing gives you no benefit**.

So why sign?

Because it costs you nothing, but gives you nothing.

So **in terms of maximizing points**, it doesn’t matter.

But the question is: **you must choose whether to sign**.

If you think the other player might sign, but we analyzed they **won’t**, because they are worse off.

So **no chance** of contract activating.

Therefore, signing leads to **0 change** in outcome.

But since the goal is to maximize your points, and signing **does not increase** your expected points, but also does **not decrease** them, then **you are indifferent**.

But we must make a choice.

Now, consider this: **if you sign, and the other player doesn’t, nothing changes**.

If you don’t sign, nothing changes.

So in both cases, you get **5 points**, assuming (A0,A0) equilibrium.

But wait — in the contract version, if both players were to sign, you could get 7.

But they won’t sign.

Can you **force** the other player to sign? No.

So you cannot bump your payoff.

Is there a possibility of a **mixed strategy equilibrium** under the contract?

Earlier we saw that P2 has a strong incentive to play A0 (gets 7 in (A0,A0)), and P1 wants to avoid P2 playing A0 (because they get only 3 instead of 5).

But P1 cannot stop you from playing A0.

But again, P1 won’t sign the contract because they are worse off.

So contract doesn’t activate.

So conclusion: **contract will not be activated**.

Therefore, **signing the contract gives you no benefit and no harm**.

But the game asks you to **maximize your points**.

Because there is **no gain**, and **no loss**, you might as well **not sign**, since it’s not helping.

But actually, **since there is no downside**, and **no upside**, you could sign or not sign.

But the question is **should you sign**?

The answer is: **No**, because signing does not increase your expected payoff, and you don’t gain anything.

Moreover, if you sign, and the other player doesn’t sign, you are on the hook for nothing.

But since it’s costless, it’s fine.

But the **optimal strategy** is to **choose not to sign**, because:
- It does not improve your payoff.
- It might incentivize the other player to **not** sign (because they see you signed, but you are waiting for them — but they don’t care).
- But actually, the other player only cares about their own payoff.

But again, **they won’t sign**.

So the safest choice is: **do not sign**, because signing provides no benefit.

But is there a way to gain from signing?

Only if the other player signs.

But since they **won’t** (they are worse off), you cannot.

So **no gain**.

Therefore, **do not sign**.

Final decision: **Do not sign**.

But let’s double-check.

Could there be a mixed strategy where you get more than 5?

Suppose in the contract game, the unique Nash equilibrium is **not** (A0,A0), but something else.

Earlier we found two pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But (A0,A0) gives P2 7, P1 3 — P1 is worse off than in base game.

P1 would only play this if they expect P2 to play A0.

But in base game, P1 expects P2 to play A0 and get 5, but now they only get 3.

So P1 will **not** want to play A0.

But at (A1,A1), P1 gets 3, same as in base game.

So P1 might prefer to stay in (A1,A1) — but P2 gets only 3, but with contract, they still get 3 (same as base game).

But at (A0,A0), P2 gets 7.

But P1 is **worse off**, so they have no incentive to play A0.

So the only equilibrium that keeps P1 at least as well off is (A1,A1) — where they get 3.

But in the **base game**, they get 5 at (A0,A0), so they are worse off overall.

Therefore, P1 will **only agree to the contract if it improves their payoff**, which it does not.

Indeed, in all outcomes, P1 gets no more than 3 under contract, but gets 5 in base (A0,A0).

So P1 is strictly worse off.

Therefore, **P1 will not sign the contract**.

Thus, **contract cannot activate**.

Therefore, signing has no benefit.

Thus, **do not sign**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 4 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Structure**

We are in a two-player simultaneous decision game. Each player chooses an action: A0 or A1, with a probability distribution. The actions are chosen simultaneously.

The **original payoff matrix** (before contract) is:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0       | A1       |
|------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                             | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| **A1**                             | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

Note: You are **Player 2**, so when we say "you", it refers to Player 2.

---

### **Step 2: Incorporate the Contract**

There’s a **contract** that modifies payoffs based on choice of A1:
- If a player chooses A1, they **pay 4 points**.
- This payment is **distributed equally among the other players**.

Since there are only **two players**, if one player chooses A1, they pay 4 points → these 4 points are split equally → **each receives 2 points** from the payment.

So for **each player who chooses A1**, their own final payoff is:
> Original payoff – 4
And the other player receives **+2** (from the penalty).

Let’s now adjust the payoff matrix **with the contract** applied.

---

### **Step 3: Update Payoff Matrix with Contract**

We’re considering the full effect on **your** (Player 2’s) payoff.

We will compute your total payoff in all four scenarios.

#### Case 1: You choose A0, Other chooses A0
- Original: you get 5
- No A1 chosen → no payment
→ **Your payoff = 5**

#### Case 2: You choose A0, Other chooses A1
- Original: you get 0
- Other chose A1 → they pay 4; you receive 2 (half)
→ Your payoff = 0 + 2 = **2**

#### Case 3: You choose A1, Other chooses A0
- Original: you get 3
- You chose A1 → you pay 4 → lose 4
- Other did not choose A1 → no payment to you
→ Your payoff = 3 – 4 = **-1**

#### Case 4: You choose A1, Other chooses A1
- Original: you get 3
- Both chose A1 → each pays 4
- So you lose 4, but receive 2 (from the other’s payment)
→ Net: 3 – 4 + 2 = **1**

Let’s tabulate the **new payoff matrix for Player 2 (you)**:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0       | A1       |
|------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                       | 5        | 2        |
| **A1**                       | -1       | 1        |

So the updated game is:

- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (2, ? — we don’t care about others, focus on you)
- (A1, A0): (-1, ?)
- (A1, A1): (1, ?)

But we must also consider the symmetry: the contract affects both sides, and for **the other player**, their payoffs would be similarly affected.

However, since our goal is **to maximize *your* total points**, we only need to focus on **your** final expected payoff.

Thus, your payoff depends solely on:
- what you do,
- what opponent does,
- the contract.

We now model this as a **one-shot simultaneous move game**, where both players choose probabilities over {A0, A1}, and then the outcome is drawn.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability you (Player 2) choose A1
- $ q $ = probability Player 1 chooses A1

Then your expected payoff is:

$$
E[\text{Your Payoff}] = 
(1-p)(1-q)\cdot5 +
(1-p)q\cdot2 +
p(1-q)\cdot(-1) +
pq\cdot1
$$

Let’s expand this:

$$
E = 5(1-p)(1-q) + 2(1-p)q - (1-q)p + pq
$$

Now expand term by term:

1. $ 5(1 - p - q + pq) = 5 - 5p - 5q + 5pq $
2. $ 2(1 - p)q = 2q - 2pq $
3. $ -p(1 - q) = -p + pq $
4. $ pq $

Now sum all:

$$
E = [5 - 5p - 5q + 5pq] + [2q - 2pq] + [-p + pq] + [pq]
$$

Combine like terms:

- Constants: 5
- $ p $ terms: -5p - p = -6p
- $ q $ terms: -5q + 2q = -3q
- $ pq $ terms: 5pq - 2pq + pq + pq = (5 - 2 + 1 + 1)pq = 5pq

So:

$$
E = 5 - 6p - 3q + 5pq
$$

Now, to find the optimal strategy, we assume that the other player (Player 1) is also rational and will optimize **their own** payoff.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

---

### **Step 4: Find Nash Equilibrium (Mixed Strategy)**

In Nash equilibrium, neither player can improve by changing their strategy, assuming the other plays fixed.

#### Let’s analyze Player 1’s incentives.

Player 1’s payoff also depends on the contract. Since the contract applies symmetrically, let's write Player 1’s payoff matrix.

**Player 1's original payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 3
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A1, A1): 3

Apply contract:
- If choosing A1, they lose 4, and get +2 from other player’s penalty.

So new payoffs for Player 1:

- (A0, A0): 5 (no A1 chosen)
- (A0, A1): 3 + 2 = 5 (other chose A1 → they get 2)
- (A1, A0): 0 - 4 = -4 (they chose A1 → pay 4, other didn’t)
- (A1, A1): 3 - 4 + 2 = 1 (pay 4, receive 2)

So Player 1’s payoff matrix:

| Their Action \ You (P2) | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|
| A0                      | 5        | 5        |
| A1                      | -4       | 1        |

So given your strategy $ p $ (probability you choose A1), Player 1’s expected payoff is:

$$
E_1 = (1-q)(5p? Wait — better to define variables clearly.

Let:
- $ p $: your (Player 2) probability of choosing A1
- $ q $: Player 1’s probability of choosing A1

Then Player 1’s expected payoff:
- Choose A0: gets $ (1-p)\cdot5 + p\cdot5 = 5 $
- Choose A1: gets $ (1-p)\cdot(-4) + p\cdot1 = -4(1-p) + p = -4 + 4p + p = -4 + 5p $

Now, in equilibrium, Player 1 must be indifferent between A0 and A1 **if mixed strategy**.

Set expected payoffs equal:

$$
5 = -4 + 5p \\
9 = 5p \\
p = 1.8
$$

Wait! That’s impossible: p cannot be 1.8. Probabilities must be ≤ 1.

This means: for any p ≤ 1, Player 1’s expected payoff from A0 is 5, and from A1 is -4 + 5p ≤ -4 + 5×1 = 1 < 5.

So **A1 always gives less than A0** for Player 1.

Therefore, Player 1 will **never** play A1 in equilibrium.

→ So **Player 1 will play A0 with probability 1** → q = 0.

That’s key.

---

### **Step 5: Given Player 1 plays A0 for sure, what should you do?**

If q = 0 (Player 1 always plays A0):

You can compute your expected payoff depending on your choice.

- If you play A0: payoff = 5 (since (A0,A0))
- If you play A1: payoff = -1 (since (A1,A0))

So clearly, **A0 is better** than A1: 5 > -1

So you should play A0 with probability 1.

Is this consistent?

But wait — could the other player have an incentive to deviate?

We already showed that if you ever mix with A1, Player 1 sees that A1 gives them at most 1 (when p=1), which is still less than 5.

So Player 1 strictly prefers A0 regardless of your strategy.

Therefore, **in any equilibrium, Player 1 plays A0 with probability 1**.

Then, knowing this, your best response is to play A0 (get 5 vs -1).

So the unique Nash equilibrium is:
- Player 1: A0 with probability 100%
- You (Player 2): A0 with probability 100%

---

### **Step 6: Final Check – Does this satisfy contract?**

Yes.

- You choose A0 → no penalty.
- Other chooses A0 → no penalty.
- So payoff: 5 points, as per first rule.

No payments occur.

Even though the contract is in place, both players avoid A1 because choosing A1 costs you 4, and you only gain at best 3 originally, and receive just 2 back if opponent also chooses A1 — but net loss likely.

But in this case, even worse: choosing A1 when opponent plays A0 leads to -1 payoff — much worse than 5.

So no reason to ever play A1.

---

### **Final Answer**

You should choose A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without the Contract**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with the following payoffs (as Player 2):

| Your Action \ Other’s Action | A0       | A1       |
|------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                       | 5        | 0        |
| **A1**                       | 3        | 3        |

Note: As Player 2, your payoffs are:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → 5
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → 0
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → 3
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → 3

This is a coordination-type game, but with an asymmetry: both get 5 if both play A0, but if you play A0 while the other plays A1, you get 0 (very bad). If you play A1, you get 3 regardless of what the other does.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Best Responses**

Let’s suppose the opponent plays A0 with probability `p`, and A1 with probability `1-p`.

Your expected payoff if you play:
- **A0**: `5*p + 0*(1-p) = 5p`
- **A1**: `3*p + 3*(1-p) = 3`

You will choose A0 only if:
> 5p > 3 → p > 3/5 = 0.6

You will choose A1 if:
> 5p < 3 → p < 0.6

At p = 0.6, you are indifferent.

So, your best response:
- A0 if opponent plays A0 with p > 0.6
- A1 if p < 0.6
- Indifferent at p = 0.6

Now, let’s suppose you are choosing your strategy, and you assume the other player is rational.

Let’s look at *their* incentives.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Opponent’s Incentives**

From the opponent's perspective (Player 1), payoffs are symmetric? Let's confirm:

| Opponent’s Action \ Your Action | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                        | 5        | 0        |
| **A1**                        | 3        | 3        |

Yes — the game is symmetric. So the same logic applies.

So equilibrium analysis should consider symmetric equilibria.

---

### **Step 4: Find Nash Equilibria**

We look for Nash equilibria in mixed strategies.

Let’s suppose both players play A0 with probability `q`.

We want each player to be indifferent between A0 and A1, so they are willing to mix.

Expected payoff for Player 2 (you) if you play A0:
> 5*q + 0*(1-q) = 5q

Expected payoff if you play A1:
> 3*q + 3*(1-q) = 3

Set equal:  
> 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So in a symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each player plays A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

This is a valid equilibrium.

Are there other equilibria?

- Pure strategy (A0, A0): mutual best response? Yes. If opponent plays A0, you get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefer A0. So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): If opponent plays A1, you get 3 for A0, 3 for A1 → indifferent. So you could play A1. So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): You play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 0, they get 3. But if you play A0 and they play A1, you’d want to switch to A1 (get 3). Opponent is already playing A1, gets 3; if they switch to A0, they get 0 (since you’re still playing A0) → they’d prefer to stay. But you want to switch → not equilibrium.
- Similarly, (A1, A0): opponent gets 0, wants to switch → not equilibrium.

So pure strategy equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Mixed: when both play A0 with prob 0.6.

---

### **Step 5: Which Equilibrium Should You Play?**

We want to *maximize your expected payoff*, assuming the other player acts rationally.

But: which equilibrium will we end up in?

Since (A0, A0) gives you 5, and (A1, A1) gives you 3, and mixed gives you 3 (from the symmetric equilibrium), you’d prefer (A0, A0).

However, in coordination games, multiple equilibria exist, and without communication, players may fail to coordinate.

But the key is: **what is the expected payoff in the mixed strategy equilibrium**?

If both play A0 with 0.6, then your expected payoff is:

- Probability both A0: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 → payoff 5
- Your A0, opponent A1: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 → payoff 0
- You A1, opponent A0: 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24 → payoff 3
- Both A1: 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16 → payoff 3

Expected payoff:
> 0.36×5 + 0.24×0 + 0.24×3 + 0.16×3 =  
> 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

Wait! That's 3.0.

But earlier we said that in the mixed strategy equilibrium, you're indifferent between A0 and A1 when opponent plays 0.6 — so expected payoff must be 3.

Yes.

So mixed equilibrium gives you 3.

But (A0, A0) gives you 5 — much better.

So why wouldn't you try to coordinate on that?

However, if *you* choose to play A0 with high probability, the opponent may not trust you, and might play A1 to avoid getting 0.

And if they play A1, you get 0 (if you play A0) or 3 (if you play A1).

So playing A0 risks getting 0.

But if you play A0 with high probability, the hope is that they also play A0.

But they know that **if they play A0**, you get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so you’ll want to play A0.

So if they play A0, you play A0 → good.

But if they play A1, you get 3 either way → you’re indifferent.

So if the opponent believes you will play A0, they are happy to play A0 (get 5), and avoid getting 0.

So (A0, A0) is a *Pareto-efficient* equilibrium.

However, unless there’s a way to coordinate, players might not reach it.

But here’s the key: **you are told that the contract was proposed by Player 2 (you), but rejected by Player 2**.

Wait — that’s strange. The contract was **proposed by Player 2**, and **rejected by Player 2**?

Let’s reread:

> Proposed by Player 2  
> Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

That’s a contradiction.

Wait — parse carefully:

> "a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):"

Then:

> "Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2"

Wait — so **Player 2 proposed it**, and **Player 2 rejected it**?

That is logically inconsistent.

But perhaps it's a typo?

Wait — perhaps it means: **the contract was proposed by Player 2, but Player 2 rejected it (not the other player)**? That still doesn’t make sense.

Alternatively: maybe “Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2” is **a mistake**, or perhaps it means **Player 2 rejected it, but the contract was proposed by Player 2**?

That doesn’t work.

Possibility: **It’s a misstatement**.

Perhaps it should say: "Player(s) who rejected it: Player 1"

But it says Player 2.

Wait, the contract was proposed by Player 2 → so if Player 2 rejected it, that would mean the proposer rejected it — which is odd.

But the sentence says: "selected via approval voting" — so it was voted on.

A proposal can be selected by approval voting, even if the proposer didn’t approve.

So perhaps: Proposal was made by Player 2, and passed in approval voting, but **Player 2 rejected it**, so it didn’t activate.

But that doesn’t make sense — if Player 2 rejected it, and it was selected via approval voting, that suggests it passed.

But then it says “it is NOT active though because some players rejected it.”

So it didn’t pass.

So if Player 2 rejected it, and it was selected via approval voting, that might mean it was rejected by some voters.

But the description says **"selected via approval voting"** — implying it passed.

This is confusing.

Wait — perhaps: “selected via approval voting” means it was the chosen proposal from multiple, but then **rejected by some players**, including Player 2.

So Player 2 proposed it, but then **rejected** it (along with perhaps others).

So: the contract is not active.

But **the key point is**: the game is played **without any contract**.

So the contract is irrelevant — it’s not active.

Therefore, we can ignore it.

So final game is the original one.

---

### **Step 6: Strategy Choice**

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Possible strategies:

- Always play A0 → expected payoff depends on their play. If they play A0 with high probability, good. But if they play A1, you get 0. Risky.
- Always play A1 → guaranteed 3.
- Mix: to make opponent indifferent, or to avoid being exploited.

But remember — we are in a symmetric game, and we’re to choose a probability distribution.

Key insight: in the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, both players play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40% → your payoff is 3.

But if you play A0 with higher chance, and if the opponent is also rational and believes you’re likely to play A0, they might play A0 → then you both get 5.

But if they are not coordinated, and they play A1, you get 0.

So if you deviate and play A0 with high probability, your expected payoff could be higher **if** the opponent plays A0, but lower if they don’t.

But: you don’t know what they will do.

However, in **rational play**, the mixed strategy equilibrium is a standard benchmark.

Moreover, (A0, A0) is a pure equilibrium, but it's **not risk-dominant**.

Let’s check risk-dominance.

In a 2x2 symmetric game, the risk-dominant equilibrium is the one that maximizes minimum payoff.

- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

So (A0, A0) is better.

But for coordination, players prefer the equilibrium that is safer.

But in this case, (A0, A0) has more to gain, but also more to lose.

Now, considering that **if you play A0**, and the opponent plays A1, you get 0 — very bad.

So playing A0 is risky.

But if you play A1, you’re guaranteed 3.

So playing A1 is safe.

Now, is there a reason to play A0?

Only if you believe the other player will play A0.

But without communication, you can't be sure.

So a reasonable default is to play **A1** → guaranteed 3.

But can you do better?

Suppose the opponent is also rational.

If they think you are likely to play A0, they might play A0 to get 5.

But if they play A0, you get 5 if you play A0, but 3 if you play A1.

So they want you to play A0.

But if they play A1, you get 0 if you play A0, 3 if you play A1.

So if the opponent plays A1, they get 0 if you play A0, 3 if you play A1.

So they prefer you to play A1.

So there’s a conflict.

Best response analysis:

- If opponent plays A0 → you prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If opponent plays A1 → you are indifferent (both give 3)

So you prefer A0 if they play A0, indifferent if they play A1.

So you should play A0 if you believe they are likely to play A0.

But that leads to a coordination problem.

Now, consider a **risk-neutral maximizer**.

You want to maximize expected payoff.

In the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, you play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40% → expected payoff = 3.

But suppose you **deviate** to playing A0 with probability 100% → then expected payoff is:

> 5 * P(opponent A0) + 0 * P(opponent A1)

If opponent plays A0 with p, your expected payoff = 5p.

But if opponent is rational, they may not play A0 with high probability — because if they play A0, and you play A0, they get 5; but if you play A1, they get 0.

So they are likely to play A1 unless they believe you are playing A0.

But again, they think the same.

So mutual belief is needed.

Without communication, the **only guaranteed** outcome is (A1, A1), which gives 3.

But (A0, A0) gives 5 — so you could do better.

But the problem is: the other player might play A1.

And if they do, you get 0 if you play A0.

So you risk getting 0.

But if you play A1, you get 3 no matter what.

So **A1 is safer**.

Moreover, in **Nash equilibrium**, A1 is part of the (A1, A1) equilibrium.

Also, the mixed equilibrium gives you 3.

So playing A1 with 100% gives you 3.

Playing A0 with high probability might give you more, but also might give you 0.

So if you are risk-averse, play A1.

But the instructions say: **maximize total points** — so you want to **maximize expected payoff**, not minimize risk.

So option: choose a distribution that **maximizes expected points**, under the assumption that the other player is playing rationally.

But what does “rational” mean?

Assuming they are also trying to maximize their payoff, and they know the game.

Now, here's a key point: **if you play a mixed strategy, you can induce them to play A0 with higher probability**?

Wait — only if they believe you will play A0 with high probability.

But in equilibrium analysis, **the mixed strategy equilibrium is the only fully self-consistent solution** if we assume symmetry and common knowledge.

But (A0, A0) is also an equilibrium — but it’s not stable.

For example: suppose you play A0, and opponent believes you will play A0 — then they play A0 → good.

But if they slightly doubt you, and play A1, then you get 0 — so you might want to switch to A1.

Then they get 3 — so they might want to play A1.

So (A0, A0) is fragile.

Whereas (A1, A1) is stable — because if they play A1, you’re indifferent, but if you deviate to A0, you get 0 if they play A1 → worse.

So (A1, A1) is a **strong equilibrium**.

(A0, A0): if you deviate to A1, you get 3 if they play A0 — which is more than 5? No — 3 < 5, so you don't want to deviate. So it’s **also** a Nash equilibrium.

Wait: If both play A0, you get 5.

If you unilaterally switch to A1, you get 3 (since opponent plays A0) → worse.

So you don’t want to deviate.

Similarly, opponent doesn’t want to deviate.

So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

So both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash equilibria.

But (A0, A0) is **riskier** because if you miscoordinate, you get 0.

So if the other player is playing A0, you prefer A0; if they play A1, you are indifferent.

But in a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium, each plays A0 with 60%.

Now, here's a strategy: **play A0 with high probability to signal cooperation**, hoping the other player plays A0.

But since there's no communication, you can't credibly signal.

So the safe choice is to play A1 — guaranteed 3.

But let's calculate: if you play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%, and assuming the other player does the same, your expected payoff is 3, as computed.

But if you play A0 with higher probability, say 100%, and suppose the other player is playing the symmetric mixed strategy (60% A0), then your expected payoff is:

> 5 * 0.6 + 0 * 0.4 = 3.0

Same as before.

If other player is playing A0 with 60%, and you play A0 with 100%, you get 5*0.6 + 0*0.4 = 3.

Same as if you played 60%.

But if the other player is playing A1, you get 0 if you play A0, 3 if you play A1.

So if you believe they are playing A1 (i.e., playing A0 with 0 prob), you should play A1.

But if you believe they are playing A0 with high probability, you should play A0.

But there's no way to know.

So the **only strategy that is robust to any behavior by the opponent** is **A1**, because you get at least 3.

But you can't guarantee more than 3.

Wait — no: if the opponent plays A0 with high probability, you can get 5.

But you don't know.

So **the optimal strategy is the one that maximizes the minimum payoff** (maximin) or **maximizes expected payoff under rational beliefs**.

But in the absence of coordination, the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is the most reasonable.

Moreover, in many such games, players play the mixed strategy.

But here's a better idea: **since (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium, and (A0, A0) is also, but the mixed equilibrium is the one with symmetry and risk neutrality**, and it gives 3.

But if you play A1 with 100%, you get 3 if the other player is playing A1.

But if they are playing A0 with high probability, you get 3 anyway — because if they play A0, you get 3 from A1.

Wait a minute:

- If you play A1, regardless of what the other player does, you get 3.

- If you play A0, you get 5 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1.

So if you play A1, you are guaranteed 3.

If you play A0, you get 5 or 0.

So **your payoff is at least 3 if you play A1**, and can be 0 if you play A0.

But **your expected payoff is maximized by playing A1 if you believe the other player might play A1**.

But in any case, **playing A1 is a dominant strategy in a way**?

No — because if you believe the other player will play A0, then playing A0 gives 5 > 3.

So it's better to play A0 in that case.

So A1 is not dominant.

But A1 is **safe**.

And in the absence of information, the **only strategy that cannot be exploited** is A1.

But we are to maximize expected payoff.

Suppose you have no beliefs about the other player.

Then you should choose a strategy that maximizes your expected payoff **in expectation over their possible strategies**.

But since we have no information, the best is to assume symmetry.

So assume they play the mixed strategy: 60% A0, 40% A1.

Then if you play A0: expected payoff = 5*0.6 + 0*0.4 = 3.0

If you play A1: expected payoff = 3*0.6 + 3*0.4 = 3.0

So same.

So you are indifferent.

So you can choose any mixture.

But you might want to avoid the risk of getting 0.

So playing A1 with 100% gives you 3 for sure.

Playing A0 with any chance gives you a chance of getting 0.

So if you are risk-averse, choose A1.

But if you are risk-neutral, you are indifferent.

But the problem says "maximize your total points" — so we want to **maximize expected points**.

But since both A0 and A1 give expected payoff 3 under symmetric beliefs, and no strategy gives more than 3, and you can achieve 3 with A1 without risk, it’s safe to play A1.

But can you do better by choosing a mixed strategy?

Suppose you play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40% — you get 3 expected payoff.

Same as always A1.

So no gain.

But you might be able to do better if the other player is not playing the symmetric equilibrium.

But we have no information.

So the most robust strategy is to play A1 with 100%.

Why? Because:
- You get 3 for sure.
- No risk of getting 0.
- If the other player plays A0, you could have gotten 5, but you chose a safer option.

But you might be missing out.

However, in the absence of any information or coordination, the **only sure thing is 3**.

Moreover, in game theory, for a player to have no incentives to deviate, and to be in an equilibrium, and given that A1 is part of a stable equilibrium, it is a strong candidate.

Moreover, the game has **two pure strategy Nash equilibria** and a mixed one.

But (A1, A1) is **risk-dominant**? Let's check.

Risk dominance is about which equilibrium has higher minimum payoff.

- (A0, A0): minimum payoff is 5 (if they coordinate)
- But if they don't coordinate, you get 0 — so minimum is 0.

Wait — no: in a Nash equilibrium, you are best-responding, so you don't deviate.

But risk dominance considers the probability of miscoordination.

In symmetric 2x2 games, risk dominance is determined by the condition that the equilibrium with higher payoff is risk-dominant if the product of the cross-payoffs is lower.

For this game:

- (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are both equilibria.

A0,A0 is risk-dominant if:

> (5 - 3) * (3 - 3) < (3 - 3) * (5 - 0) ? 

Wait, standard condition:

For payoff matrix:

|        | A0  | A1  |
|--------|-----|-----|
| A0     | 5   | 0   |
| A1     | 3   | 3   |

The risk-dominant equilibrium is the one for which:

> (a - c)(a - d) > (b - d)(b - c)

Where:
- a = payoff to player 1 if both play A0: 5
- b = payoff if player 1 plays A0, player 2 plays A1: 0
- c = payoff if player 1 plays A1, player 2 plays A0: 3
- d = payoff if both play A1: 3

So:
> (a - c) = 5 - 3 = 2
> (a - d) = 5 - 3 = 2
> (b - d) = 0 - 3 = -3
> (b - c) = 0 - 3 = -3

So left: (2)(2) = 4
Right: (-3)(-3) = 9

4 < 9 → so (A1, A1) is risk-dominant.

Yes! So (A1, A1) is risk-dominant equilibrium.

This means that even if players are unsure, (A1, A1) is more likely to be played.

So in the absence of communication, rational players may coordinate on (A1, A1) because it's safer.

Therefore, it is rational to play A1.

Moreover, playing A1 gives you 3 for sure.

Playing A0 might give you 5 or 0, but with (A1, A1) being risk-dominant, it's likely the outcome.

Therefore, the best strategy is to play A1 with 100%.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
To determine which contracts to approve, let's analyze the expected payoffs for each scenario, both with and without the contracts. 

### Scenario Analysis without Contracts

First, let's establish the expected payoffs without any contracts:

- **If both choose A0 (P1: A0, P2: A0):**
  - P1: 5 points
  - P2: 5 points

- **If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1 (P1: A0, P2: A1):**
  - P1: 0 points
  - P2: 3 points

- **If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0 (P1: A1, P2: A0):**
  - P1: 3 points
  - P2: 0 points

- **If both choose A1 (P1: A1, P2: A1):**
  - P1: 3 points
  - P2: 3 points

### Scenario Analysis with Player 1's Contract

**Player 1's Contract:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

**Adjusted Payoffs:**

- **If both choose A0 (P1: A0, P2: A0):**
  - P1: 5 + 2 - 1 = 6 points
  - P2: 5 + 2 - 1 = 6 points

- **If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1 (P1: A0, P2: A1):**
  - P1: 0 + 2 = 2 points
  - P2: 3 - 1 = 2 points

- **If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0 (P1: A1, P2: A0):**
  - P1: 3 - 1 = 2 points
  - P2: 0 + 2 = 2 points

- **If both choose A1 (P1: A1, P2: A1):**
  - P1: 3 points
  - P2: 3 points

### Scenario Analysis with Player 2's Contract

**Player 2's Contract:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

**Adjusted Payoffs:**

- **If both choose A0 (P1: A0, P2: A0):**
  - P1: 5 + 5/2 - 5/2 = 5 points
  - P2: 5 + 5/2 - 5/2 = 5 points

- **If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1 (P1: A0, P2: A1):**
  - P1: 0 + 5/2 = 2.5 points
  - P2: 3 - 5/2 = 0.5 points

- **If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0 (P1: A1, P2: A0):**
  - P1: 3 - 5/2 = 0.5 points
  - P2: 0 + 5/2 = 2.5 points

- **If both choose A1 (P1: A1, P2: A1):**
  - P1: 3 points
  - P2: 3 points

### Conclusion

- **Player 1's Contract** increases mutual cooperation value in A0 to 6 points each, compared to original values.
- **Player 2's Contract** keeps mutual cooperation the same at 5 points for A0 choice but penalizes non-cooperation more heavily, leading to uneven and lower point distributions.

Therefore, **Player 1's Contract** presents a more balanced and equitable scenario that encourages both players to choose A0 without the skewing effect of player penalties for different choices.

Thus, we will approve Player 1's Proposed Contract and disapprove Player 2's.

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": false

response:
To evaluate the proposed contracts and decide which ones to approve, we need to analyze the effects of each contract on the payoffs in the game. 

### Analyzing the Current Payoff Without Any Contracts
The payoff matrix without any contracts is:
- A0 vs A0: 5 points each
- A0 vs A1: 0 points (you), 3 points (the other player)
- A1 vs A0: 3 points (you), 0 points (the other player)
- A1 vs A1: 3 points each

### Analyzing Contract Proposals

#### Contract proposed by Player 1 (C1)
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points drawn equally from the other player.

Implementing this contract changes the payoff matrix as follows:
- A0 vs A0: (5 + 2) - 2 = 5 points each. 
- A0 vs A1: (0 + 2) - 2 = 0 points (you), 3 points (the other player) - 2 = 1 point (the other player). Net result: 0 points (you), 1 point (the other player).
- A1 vs A0: 3 - 2 = 1 point (you), (0 + 2) - 2 = 0 points (the other player). Net result: 1 point (you), 0 points (the other player).
- A1 vs A1: 3 points each (no change).

#### Contract proposed by Player 2 (C2)
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points drawn equally from the other player.

Implementing this contract changes the payoff matrix as follows:
- A0 vs A0: (5 + 4) - 4 = 5 points each.
- A0 vs A1: (0 + 4) - 4 = 0 points (you), 3 points (the other player). Net result: 0 points (you), 3 points (the other player).
- A1 vs A0: 3 - 4 = -1 points (you), (0 + 4) - 4 = 0 points (the other player). Net result: -1 points (you), 0 points (the other player).
- A1 vs A1: 3 points each (no change).

### Conclusion
To maximize your expected payoff, you should evaluate which contracts improve your expected outcomes without severely compromising your payoffs:

1. **Contract C1 improves the payoff for mutual cooperation (A0, A0) without penalizing A0, A1 pairings.**
2. **Contract C2 greatly penalizes A1 when the other player selects A0, which could discourage non-cooperative behavior on one side and lead to negative payoffs.**

Given these considerations, approving C1 is beneficial as it incentivizes cooperation without creating extreme negative payoffs in non-cooperative pairings. Contract C2, on the other hand, has a substantial downside risk due to the -1 payoff you could receive.

Therefore, the final decision should be to approve C1 and disapprove C2:

```json
{
    "C1": true,
    "C2": false
}
```

response:
First, let's analyze the incentives and outcomes in the original game without any contracts.

### Original Game Analysis
Payoff matrix:
- (A0, A0): Player 1 gets 5 points, Player 2 gets 5 points.
- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
- (A1, A1): Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.

### Evaluating Contracts

#### Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):
- A0: +2 points from the opponent.
- A1: No additional payments.

New payoffs:
- (A0, A0): Player 1 -> \(5 + 2 = 7\), Player 2 -> \(5 - 2 = 3\)
- (A0, A1): Player 1 -> \(0 + 2 = 2\), Player 2 -> \(3 - 2 = 1\)
- (A1, A0): Player 1 -> \(3\), Player 2 -> \(0 + 2 = 2\)
- (A1, A1): Player 1 -> \(3\), Player 2 -> \(3\)

Evaluating incentives:
- For Player 1: A0 now yields better payoffs than A1 in all scenarios except (A1, A0).
- For Player 2: Somewhat disadvantaged, but A1 is still better for Player 2 given Player 1 might frequently choose A0 to maximize their score.

#### Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):
- A0: +1 point from the opponent.
- A1: No additional payments.

New payoffs:
- (A0, A0): Player 1 -> \(5 + 1 = 6\), Player 2 -> \(5 - 1 = 4\)
- (A0, A1): Player 1 -> \(0 + 1 = 1\), Player 2 -> \(3 - 1 = 2\)
- (A1, A0): Player 1 -> \(3\), Player 2 -> \(0 + 1 = 1\)
- (A1, A1): Player 1 -> \(3\), Player 2 -> \(3\)

Evaluating incentives:
- For Player 1: A0 is more favorable than before, and there is some incentive to choose A0 over A1.
- For Player 2: The contract still favors A0 slightly, but A1 stands well based on Player 1’s response.

### Decision Criteria for Approval
We need to approve those contracts which:
1. Maximize our total points.
2. Ensure fairness and reciprocity, making Player 2 more likely to accept.

For Contract C1:
- Substantially better for Player 1 but might not be acceptable for Player 2 due to disproportionate disadvantage.

For Contract C2:
- Provides moderate improvement to Player 1’s outcomes while maintaining more balance, making it a fair proposal.

Given this analysis:

```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}
```

### Reasoning
- Approving Contract C2 is beneficial as it provides a moderate points-increase with increased fairness and higher chances of mutual agreement.
- Not approving Contract C1 as it’s heavily biased, reducing the likelihood of Player 2’s acceptance and cooperation, potentially lowering total points if no contract is agreed upon.

Final JSON output:
```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}
```

response:
In this decision-making game, our objective is to maximize the total points received. Given the contracts proposed, we need to carefully analyze their impact on the game's outcome and decide whether we should approve them or not.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Base Game Matrix (Without Contracts)

From the original payoff description:

- (A0, A0) → (5, 5)
- (A0, A1) → (0, 3)
- (A1, A0) → (3, 0)
- (A1, A1) → (3, 3)

Player 1 (myself) wants to maximize my payoff. 

#### Contract Analysis

Both proposed contracts are identical:

**Contract Proposed by Both Players (C1 and C2)**

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

Let's modify the payoff table to include the contract's impact:

**With Contract Impact:**

| \      | P2 chooses A0 | P2 chooses A1 |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1 chooses A0** | (5 + 2, 5 - 2) = (7, 3) | (0 + 2, 3 - 2) = (2, 1) |
| **P1 chooses A1** | (3 - 2, 0 + 2) = (1, 2) | (3, 3) |

#### New Payoff Matrix with the Contract:

- (A0, A0) → (7, 3)
- (A0, A1) → (2, 1)
- (A1, A0) → (1, 2)
- (A1, A1) → (3, 3)

### Strategic Implications

By including the contract:

1. Choosing A0 is heavily incentivized due to the additional 2 points.
2. When both players choose A0, the total payoff is the highest (7, 3).

Given this, the contract changes the game dynamics:

- Without the contract, (A1, A1) might be a safe choice due to equal payoff (3, 3).
- With the contract, choosing A0 becomes more attractive for both players since it significantly increases their expected payoff.

### Approval Decision

Since both contracts are identical and beneficial for Player 1 by encouraging a higher combined payoff scenario when both players choose A0, approving both contracts is advantageous.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, I will approve both proposed contracts.

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

This approval aligns with the goal of maximizing my expected payoff in the game.

To determine which contracts to approve, let's analyze the impact each proposed contract has on the game's payoffs.

### Original Payoff Matrix:
|                 | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 5, 5         | 0, 3         |
| **Player 1: A1** | 3, 0         | 3, 3         |

### Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Impact on payoffs:
- If both choose A0, each gains 2 points from the other, resulting in no net change: (5, 5) -> (5, 5)
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 receives 2 points from Player 2: (0 + 2, 3 - 2) -> (2, 1)
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 2 receives 2 points from Player 1: (3 - 2, 0 + 2) -> (1, 2)
- If both choose A1, there is no change: (3, 3) -> (3, 3)

Adjusted Payoff Matrix for Contract 1:
|                 | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 5, 5         | 2, 1         |
| **Player 1: A1** | 1, 2         | 3, 3         |

### Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other player.

Impact on payoffs:
- If both choose A0, no change: (5, 5) -> (5, 5)
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 2 pays 1 point to Player 1: (0 + 1, 3 - 1) -> (1, 2)
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 pays 1 point to Player 2: (3 - 1, 0 + 1) -> (2, 1)
- If both choose A1, both pay 1 point to the other, resulting in no net change: (3 - 1 + 0.5, 3 - 1 + 0.5) -> (2.5, 2.5)

Adjusted Payoff Matrix for Contract 2:
|                 | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 5, 5         | 1, 2         |
| **Player 1: A1** | 2, 1         | 2.5, 2.5     |

### Analysis:
- **Contract 1 (Player 1 proposal):**
  - Encourages Player 1 to choose A0 more often (to gain an additional 2 points if the other player chooses A1).
- **Contract 2 (Player 2 proposal):**
  - Reduces the payoff for choosing A1 slightly compared to A0, slightly incentivizing A0 for both players.

Given that the primary goal is to maximize my own points:
- Contract 1 is favorable because it increases the scenarios where I can gain additional points by choosing A0 when the other player is expected to choose A1.
- Contract 2 is less favorable because it does not provide an equally strong incentive for collaboration or an increased payoff.

### Conclusion:
Approving Contract 1 is strategically better to maximize the potential points for Player 1.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
In order to determine which contracts to approve, we first need to evaluate the implications of each contract on the payoffs and strategies in the game. Let's consider the original payoffs and how the contracts modify them.

### Original Game Payoffs (Player 2):

1. You choose A0, other player chooses A0: 5 points
2. You choose A0, other player chooses A1: 0 points
3. You choose A1, other player chooses A0: 3 points
4. You choose A1, other player chooses A1: 3 points

### Contract Proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

#### Modified Payoffs with Contract 1:
1. You choose A0, other player chooses A0: \(5 + 2 - 2 = 5\) points (no change)
2. You choose A0, other player chooses A1: \(0 + 2 - 1 = 1\) points
3. You choose A1, other player chooses A0: \(3\) points (no change)
4. You choose A1, other player chooses A1: \(3\) points (no change)

### Contract Proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

#### Modified Payoffs with Contract 2:
1. You choose A0, other player chooses A0: \(5 + 1 - 1 = 5\) points (no change)
2. You choose A0, other player chooses A1: \(0 + 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\) points
3. You choose A1, other player chooses A0: \(3 - 1 = 2\) points
4. You choose A1, other player chooses A1: \(3 - 1 = 2\) points

### Analysis:

**Contract 1 Analysis:**
- Choosing A0 against A1 becomes more favorable since it gives 1 point instead of 0. However, it doesn't affect other outcomes much.
- The change from 0 to 1 point for (A0, A1) could slightly incentivize choosing A0 more often than previously.

**Contract 2 Analysis:**
- Choosing A0 against A1 yields 0.5 points, which is slightly better than 0.
- Choosing A1 becomes less attractive because it incurs a penalty of 1 point overall, giving only 2 points regardless of the other player's choice.

### Optimal Choices:
Evaluate the expected utility with each contract and without contracts:

#### Without Contract:
Mixed strategies or equilibria need to be calculated, but let's simplify:
- A1 might be preferred due to consistent 3 points unless certainty on opponent's move.

#### With Contract 1:
- Impacts primarily (A0, A1) to become a bit more incentivized. However, overall payoff doesn't drastically change.

#### With Contract 2:
- Penalizes A1 choice significantly, better incenting A0 in many cases.

Player 2 analysis should consider the net gains:
- Contract 2 offers a better alteration beneficial for more strategic plays rendering higher overall outcomes.

### Final Reasoning and Decision:
Given the payoffs and probable strategies, Contract 2 is more beneficial as it discourages high penalties and promotes mutual optimal decision-making.

Thus, the final JSON approval will be:
```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}
```

response:
To evaluate which contracts to approve, we need to analyze the potential outcomes for each contract under the given game rules and additional payments introduced by each contract. Let's go through both proposed contracts step-by-step.

### Contract proposed by Player 1 (C1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

#### Payoff Matrix with C1:
The additional payment only applies when a player chooses A0. Here's the adjusted payoff matrix considering the 2 points change:

- You choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You: 5 + 2/2 = 6 points (You gain 2, lose 1. Net gain of 1)
  - Other player: 5 + 2/2 = 6 points (Same net gain as you)

- You choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You: 0 + 0 = 0 points (You gain 2, lose 2. Net 0)
  - Other player: 3 + 0 = 3 points (Same net gain as original)

- You choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You: 3 + 0 = 3 points (No additional payment changes)
  - Other player: 0 + 0 = 0 points (Same net gain as original)

- You choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You: 3 + 0 = 3 points (No additional payment changes)
  - Other player: 3 + 0 = 3 points (Same net gain as original)

#### Strategy Implications of C1:
Under this contract, choosing A0 becomes slightly more attractive due to the additional point net. This may incentivize both players to choose A0 over A1 more often. However, choosing A1 still maintains a utility of 3 points either way you or the other player picks. Let's proceed to evaluate the second contract.

### Contract proposed by Player 2 (C2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

#### Payoff Matrix with C2:
The additional payment applies differently for choosing A0 and A1. Let's see how the payoffs change:

- You choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You: 5 + 1/2 = 5.5 points (You gain 1, lose 0.5. Net gain of 0.5)
  - Other player: 5 + 1/2 = 5.5 points (Same net gain as you)

- You choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You: 0 + 1/2 = 0.5 points (You gain 1, they're paying 1. Net gain 0.5)
  - Other player: 3 - 2/2 = 2 points (They pay 1, you don't lose, net gain 2)

- You choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You: 3 - 2/2 = 2 points (You pay 1, they gain. Net 2)
  - Other player: 0 + 1/2 = 0.5 points (No additional net payment for them, they net 0.5)

- You choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You: 3 - 2/2 = 2 points (You lose 1, they pay. Net 2)
  - Other player: 3 - 2/2 = 2 points (Same net as you)

#### Strategy Implications of C2:
Under this contract, choosing A1 is heavily penalized due to the loss of an extra point. Therefore, choosing A0 becomes more favorable to avoid the extra penalty points. Both players will likely prioritize A0 to avoid the penalties associated with A1.

### Decision:
Given both contracts, here's the approval decision:

- **C1**: Increases payoff for A0 slightly, which may not deter both players from choosing A0. It is reasonable and less complex.
- **C2**: It heavily penalizes A1, makes the game more biased towards choosing A0 due to the loss in potential points.

Thus, **approving C1** as it gives a fair adjustment while not over-penalizing either action in the game.

  "C1": true,
  "C2": false

Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Restate the Payoff Matrix:**
   - If both players choose A0, you both get 5 points.
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you get 0 points and they get 3 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, you get 3 points and they get 0 points.
   - If both players choose A1, you both get 3 points.

2. **Restate the Contract:**
   - Choosing A0 gives an additional 1 point to the player and subtracts 1 point from the other player.
   - Choosing A1 subtracts 2 points from the player and distributes 2 points to the other player.

3. **Adjusted Payoffs with the Contract:**
   - If both players choose A0:
     - Each player gets 5 + 1 - 1 = 5 points.
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
     - You get 0 + 1 - 1 = 0 points.
     - The other player gets 3 - 2 + 2 = 3 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
     - You get 3 - 2 + 2 = 3 points.
     - The other player gets 0 + 1 - 1 = 0 points.
   - If both players choose A1:
     - Each player gets 3 - 2 + 2 = 3 points.

4. **Effect of the Contract:**
   - The contract does not change the payoffs in any of the cases because the additional points either cancel out (when both actions are the same) or remain unaffected (net distribution is zero).

5. **Game Strategy Analysis:**
   - Without the contract, both players choosing A0 yields the highest payoff (5 points each).
   - With the contract, the payoffs are the same as without the contract in every scenario.

6. **Decision to Sign:**
   - The contract neither benefits nor penalizes you compared to not signing it. The actual scores remain unchanged.
   - Since the contract effectively does not alter the payoffs, both players should logically be indifferent.

Based on the analysis, it makes sense to sign the contract because it does not negatively affect your payoffs.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{"sign": true}
```

response:
To determine whether or not to sign the contract, we need to analyze how it changes the expected payoffs for each player. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Payoff Matrix without the Contract

Let's first consider the payoffs without the contract:
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A0: (5, 5)
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: (0, 3)
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: (3, 0)
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A1: (3, 3)

### Step 2: Apply the Impact of the Contract

The contract specifies that:
- Choosing A0 gives an additional payment of 1 point.
- Choosing A1 costs an additional payment of 2 points.

Thus, the payoffs change as follows (remember that payments are points exchanged between players):
- If both choose A0:
  - Player 1 receives 5 + 1 = 6 points.
  - Player 2 receives 5 + 1 = 6 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1 receives 0 + 1 = 1 point.
  - Player 2 receives 3 - 2 = 1 point.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1 receives 3 - 2 = 1 point.
  - Player 2 receives 0 + 1 = 1 point.
- If both choose A1:
  - Player 1 receives 3 - 2 = 1 point.
  - Player 2 receives 3 - 2 = 1 point.

### Step 3: Compare the New Payoff Matrix with the Original Payoff Matrix

With the contract:
- (A0, A0): (6, 6)
- (A0, A1): (1, 1)
- (A1, A0): (1, 1)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

Without the contract:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### Step 4: Evaluating the Decision to Sign the Contract

If we don't sign the contract, the best choice for both players could still be choosing A0, leading to (5, 5). 
With the contract, if both players choose A0, they each get (6, 6), which is strictly better.

However, if there's any mismatch (one chooses A0, the other A1), both players would only get (1, 1) with the contract, while without it, one would get (0, 3) or (3, 0).

Given both players are rational and ideally want to maximize their points:
- Signing the contract guarantees both players higher maximum payoffs when they both choose A0.
- The contract equally distributes additional benefits and costs, promoting mutual cooperation.

### Conclusion

Given that signing the contract improves the outcomes when both players choose the cooperative strategy (A0), we should agree to sign it to maximize potential points.

Therefore, the decision is to sign the contract.

{"sign": true}
```

response:
To maximize your total points in this game considering the payoff descriptions and the payment contract, we need to evaluate the expected outcomes for each choice.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### **Without the Contract:**

1. **Pure Payoffs Analysis:**
   - If you choose A0:
     - Other player chooses A0: 5 points
     - Other player chooses A1: 0 points
   - If you choose A1:
     - Other player chooses A0: 3 points
     - Other player chooses A1: 3 points

#### **With the Contract:**

2. **Adjust Payoffs According to the Contract:**
   - Choosing A0:
     - You receive an additional +1 point.
     - Other player loses 1 point.
   - Choosing A1:
     - You pay 2 points.
     - Other player receives +2 points.

3. **Adjusted Payoff Table:**
   - If you choose A0 (net of the contract adjustments):
     - Other player chooses A0: you get 5+1=6 points, other player gets 5-1=4 points.
     - Other player chooses A1: you get 0+1=1 point, other player gets 3-1=2 points.
   - If you choose A1:
     - Other player chooses A0: you get 3-2=1 point, other player gets 0+2=2 points.
     - Other player chooses A1: you get 3-2=1 point, other player gets 3+2=5 points.

#### **Expected Value Calculation:**
To find the optimal strategy, let's compute the expected payoffs assuming the other player is also making rational decisions.

First, let's express the expected value based on your strategy probabilities:
   - Let \( P(A0) = p \)
   - Let \( P(A1) = 1 - p \)

Using the altered payoffs:
- **Expected Payment for Choosing A0:**
  $$ E(A0) = 6P(A0) + 1P(A1) $$
- **Expected Payment for Choosing A1:**
  $$ E(A1) = 1P(A0) + 1P(A1) $$

Given symmetric rationality, if we assume 50-50 probability distribution for simplicity:
- \( P(A0) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(A1) = 0.5 \)

Hence,
- For choosing \( A0 \):
  $$ E(A0) = 6 (0.5) + 1(0.5) = 3 + 0.5 = 3.5 $$
- For choosing \( A1 \):
  $$ E(A1) = 1(0.5) + 1(0.5) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 $$

Clearly, choosing \( A0 \) has a higher expected value than choosing \( A1 \).

### Conclusion:

Given the computations, consistently choosing \( A0 \) yields a higher expected payoff. However, in practical situations, introducing slight randomness may help to avoid predictability. Nonetheless, hereon the strategy:

- **Final Strategy in JSON Format:**
```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

This would maximize your expected score given the payoffs and the contract structure.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Let's break down the problem step by step to formulate an optimal strategy, taking the additional payment contract into account.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Payoff Matrix Without Contract:**
   ```
   Player 2 \ Player 1   A0        A1
           A0          (5, 5)    (0, 3)
           A1          (3, 0)    (3, 3)
   ```

2. **Contract Effects:**
   - If Player 2 chooses A0, they receive an additional 1 point; if Player 2 chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0, they receive an additional 1 point; if Player 1 chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points.

3. **Adjusted Payoff Matrix with Contract:**
   ```
   Player 2 \ Player 1   A0        A1
           A0          (6, 6)    (1, 1 + 1)
           A1          (2.5, 0)  (0.5, 1)
   ```

   Explanation:
   - (A0, A0): Both receive 5 points + 1 point from the other (6, 6).
   - (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 0 points + 1 = 1, Player 1 gets 3 points - 2 + 1 = 1.
   - (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 3 points - 2 = 1, Player 1 gets 0 points + 1.
   - (A1, A1): Both get 3 points - 2 points = 1 for each.

4. **Expected Payoffs:**
   - Choosing A0 maximizes the payoff when both players choose it, yielding (6, 6).
   - Both players earn considerably less when choosing A1, especially when matched with A1, producing (1, 1) or (0.5,1).

5. **Strategy:**
   Given the new payoff matrix, it makes sense for Player 2 to choose A0 with a high probability, as it maximizes the potential payoff compared to choosing A1 where the net gain is usually lower or even negative.

6. **Probability Distribution:**
   To ensure the maximum payoff, Player 2 should primarily choose A0. However, allowing for a slight probability of A1 can serve as a form of mixed strategy that might be beneficial if Player 1 over-adjusts to a pure strategy. Let's set this probability distribution.

### Final Distribution:

Based on the consideration above, a highly favored strategy towards A0 with minimal allowance for A1 manipulation seems optimal.

```json
{"A0": 90, "A1": 10}
```

This strategic decision maximizes Player 2's expected payoff considering the payment contract in place.

response:
To determine which contracts to approve, we need to analyze the effect of each contract on the expected payoff. The contracts will modify the basic game's payoffs by adjusting the points received or lost depending on the action chosen.

First, let's understand the payoffs under the basic game rules:

- If both choose A0: Both players get 5 points.
- If Player 2 (you) chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: You get 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
- If Player 2 (you) chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: You get 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: Both players get 3 points.

Now, let's incorporate the proposed contracts into the payoffs:

### Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)
- A player choosing A0 gets an additional 1 point (drawn equally from the other player).
  - If both choose A0: Both players get 5 + 1 - 1 = 5 points (no change).
  - If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: You get 0 + 1 -1 = 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 points (no change).
  - If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: You get 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 + 1 - 1 = 0 points (no change).
  - If both choose A1: Both players get 3 points (no change).

### Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)
- A player choosing A0 gets an additional 1 point drawn equally from the other player.
- A player choosing A1 pays an additional 2 points distributed equally among the other players.
  - If both choose A0: Both players get 5 + 1 -1 = 5 points (no change).
  - If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: You get 0 + 1 - 1 = 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 - 1 + 1 - 2 = 0.5 points.
  - If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: You get 3 - 2 = 1 point, Player 1 gets 0 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3 points.
  - If both choose A1: You get 3 - 2 = 1 point, Player 1 gets 3 - 2 = 1 point.

#### Analysis:

For Contract C1: 
- There is no actual change in any payoffs. The payoffs remain as in the basic game.

For Contract C2:
- It heavily penalizes choosing A1 with an additional 2-point deduction, making A0 the far superior choice.
- If players both act rationally to maximize their expected points, both are more likely to choose A0. This would give both players consistent payoffs of 5 points instead of 3 points, which is more favorable.

Given the above analysis, Contract C2 is more advantageous because it incentivizes both players to choose A0, yielding a higher consistent payoff. Therefore, we should approve Contract C2 and disapprove Contract C1.

Here's the final JSON object for the approvals:
```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}

response:
Both contracts create a transfer **to whoever plays A0**, paid by the other player (since there are only 2 players, “drawn equally from the other players” means the opponent pays the full amount).

### Baseline (no contract)
This is a coordination-type game: (A0,A0) gives 5 each, (A1,A1) gives 3 each, and the off-diagonals are asymmetric.

---

## Contract C1 (A0 earns +1 from the other player)
Compute my (Player 2) net payoffs:

- (P1 A0, P2 A0): base 5, I receive +1 but also pay -1 (because P1 played A0) → **5**
- (P1 A0, P2 A1): base 0, I pay -1 → **-1**
- (P1 A1, P2 A0): base 3, I receive +1 → **4**
- (P1 A1, P2 A1): base 3 → **3**

So for me, **A0 strictly dominates A1** (5 > -1 if P1 plays A0; 4 > 3 if P1 plays A1). Same logic holds for Player 1. This forces (A0,A0), giving me **5**.

**Conclusion:** C1 is good (guarantees A0).

---

## Contract C2 (A0 earns +4 from the other player)
My net payoffs:

- (A0,A0): base 5, +4 and -4 cancel → **5**
- (A0,A1): base 0, pay -4 → **-4**
- (A1,A0): base 3, receive +4 → **7**
- (A1,A1): base 3 → **3**

Again, **A0 strictly dominates A1** for me (5 > -4; 7 > 3), and for Player 1 as well. So (A0,A0) is enforced, giving me **5**.

Compared to C1, if there is any chance the other player plays A1 anyway, C2 rewards me more for sticking with A0 (7 vs 4 in the (A1,A0) case for me). So **C2 weakly dominates C1 from my perspective** (never worse in equilibrium, potentially better off-equilibrium).

---

## Voting strategy
If I approve **both**, and Player 1 also approves both, then there’s a tie and the winner is random between C1 and C2—unnecessarily risking getting the weaker (for me) contract C1.

To maximize the chance C2 is selected, I should **approve only C2**.

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

response:
To decide what to approve, I compare how each contract changes the *actual incentives in the game* (since after voting, we’ll play the resulting game to maximize points).

### Step 1: Baseline (no contract)
Payoffs to **Player 2**:

- (A0,A0): 5  
- (A0,A1): 0  
- (A1,A0): 3  
- (A1,A1): 3  

This is a coordination game with two pure equilibria: (A0,A0) giving me 5, and (A1,A1) giving me 3.

---

### Step 2: Contract C1 (A0 gets +2 from the other player)
Transfers are zero-sum between players.

Updated payoffs for **Player 2**:

- (A0,A0): still 5 (I gain 2 but also pay 2)
- (A0,A1): 0 + 2 = 2
- (A1,A0): 3 − 2 = 1
- (A1,A1): still 3

Best responses remain the same (match the other player), so the game still has **two equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).  
So C1 **does not guarantee** the good outcome (A0,A0); it only nudges incentives.

Crucially for voting strategy: if I approve C1, it can win the vote and *replace* C2, which would be worse for me than having C2.

---

### Step 3: Contract C2 (A0 gets +4 from the other player)
Updated payoffs for **Player 2**:

- (A0,A0): still 5
- (A0,A1): 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1,A0): 3 − 4 = -1
- (A1,A1): 3

Now:
- If Player 1 plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > -1)
- If Player 1 plays A1: I still prefer A0 (4 > 3)

So **A0 becomes my dominant strategy**, and symmetrically it’s Player 1’s dominant strategy too.  
That makes (A0,A0) the **unique equilibrium**, giving me 5 for sure (under standard rational play).

---

### Step 4: Approval decision (strategic voting)
If I approve both C1 and C2, I risk increasing the chance C1 is selected (or even making C1 the sole winner depending on Player 1’s vote), which is worse than ensuring C2.

So:
- Approve **C2**
- Reject **C1** (to avoid helping it beat/tie C2)

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

response:
To solve this problem, we need to carefully evaluate whether signing the contract will maximize our points in the game. We'll proceed step by step, analyzing the payoffs with and without the contract.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Understand the Basic Payoffs Without the Contract:**
   - If both players choose A0: Both get 5 points.
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
   - If both players choose A1: Both get 3 points.

2. **Evaluate the Payoffs With the Contract:**
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points, which are deducted from the other player.
   
   Thus, the payoffs become:
   - If both choose A0: Each gets 5+2 = 7 points, but then each loses 2 points to the other. The final result is each gets 5 points.
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0+2-2 = 0 points, and the other player gets 3 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, and the other player gets 0+2-2 = 0 points.
   - If both choose A1: Each gets 3 points.

   Notice that with the contract, the payoffs remain unchanged. Therefore, the nature of players' choices and their incentives are the same with and without the contract.

### Applying Game Theory:
Without the contract, the prudent strategy hinges on what's called a Nash Equilibrium. This is where no player benefits from changing their strategy while the other player's strategy remains unchanged.

In our example:
- Both players choosing A1 results in 3 points each.
- Both choosing A0 yields a higher 5 points each.
- But if we look at individual incentives without trust or enforcement, choosing A1 avoids potentially receiving 0 points when the other selects A1.

The incentives don't change with the contract since the relative payoffs do not alter. Therefore, the contract neither benefits nor harms our payoffs or strategies.

### Conclusion:
Since the contract doesn't affect the final payoffs or strategies but doesn't impose any additional harm or benefit, there is no intrinsic downside to signing it. Therefore, signing it is acceptable.

### Final Decision:
```json
{"sign": true}
```

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which contract(s) you, as **Player 2**, should approve.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contracts)**

The payoff matrix for the base game is:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0         | A1         |
|------------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                             | (5, 5)     | (0, 3)     |
| **A1**                             | (3, 0)     | (3, 3)     |

You are **Player 2**, so your payoffs are listed second in each pair.

- If both play A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0, other plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 0
- If both play A1 → you get 3

This is a coordination game with some incentives. Let’s analyze whether there are dominant strategies or Nash equilibria.

#### Best responses:
- If you believe the other will play A0:
  - Your best response: A0 (5 > 3)
- If you believe the other will play A1:
  - Your best response: A1 (3 > 0)

So no dominant strategy for you. However, note:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 — better than (A1, A1) where both get 3.
- But if you pick A0 and other picks A1, you lose badly (0 points).

Thus, (A0, A0) is Pareto optimal, but risky if you’re unsure about the other player.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

A **contract** modifies the payoffs based on actions.

Each contract specifies an **additional payment** that applies **if a player chooses a particular action**, and these payments are **drawn from the other player**.

#### Contracts:

- **C1 (Proposal by Player 1)**:
  - If you choose A0 → +2 points, paid by the other player
  - If you choose A1 → no additional payment

- **C2 (Proposal by Player 2)**:
  - If you choose A0 → +2 points, paid by the other player
  - If you choose A1 → no additional payment

→ **Wait! C1 and C2 are identical in wording.**

> “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”

So both proposals say the same thing: if you play A0, you gain +2; this +2 comes from the other player (i.e., *your* payoff increases, *their* decreases).

Since they are **identical in effect**, we can assume the contracts are functionally the same.

But note: they're labeled differently: C1 by Player 1, C2 by Player 2.

But the **effect on payoffs** is identical.

So let’s compute the **new payout table** under **either contract** (since both give same outcome):

---

### **Step 3: Revised Payoff Matrix Under Contract (C1 or C2)**

Now, for any choice of A0, you get **+2** extra from the other player. So:
- Choosing A0: **+2**, paid by other player
- Choosing A1: **no change**

So we need to update the original payoff pairs accordingly.

We'll recompute payoffs **from Player 2’s perspective** (since you are Player 2), assuming the contract is in effect.

New payoff matrix (each pair is (Player 1, Player 2)):

| P1 \ P2 | A0              | A1             |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **A0**  | (5 – 2, 5 + 2) = (3, 7) | (0 – 2, 3 + 2) = (-2, 5) |
| **A1**  | (3 + 2, 0 – 2) = (5, –2) | (3 + 2, 3 + 2) = (5, 5) |

Wait — careful!

- The contract says: **“If a player chooses A0, they receive +2, drawn equally from the other player.”**
- So **any player** playing A0 gets +2 from the other player.

Hence:
- If **you** (Player 2) play A0 → you get +2 (paid by Player 1)
- If **Player 1** plays A0 → he gets +2 (paid by you, Player 2)

So the total transfer:
- For every A0 played, the player gains +2, the other loses 2.

Therefore, we must apply this adjustment to **both** players’ payoffs.

Let’s recalculate the full matrix under the contract.

#### Original payoff → then adjust for contract effects

**Case 1: Both play A0**
- Original: (5, 5)
- P1 plays A0 → gains +2 → becomes 5 + 2 = 7
- P2 plays A0 → gains +2 → becomes 5 + 2 = 7
- But who pays whom? They each receive +2, but only one payer: **the other player**.

Wait — problem: **"Drawn equally from the other players"** — but if both players play A0, then **each receives +2 from the other**. That implies **each pays 2 and receives 2** → net zero?

But that contradicts "drawn equally from the other players".

Let’s parse the phrasing carefully:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

This is ambiguous.

Does **"drawn equally from the other players"** mean the payment comes from **all other players collectively**?

But there’s **only one other player**.

So "drawn equally from the other players" likely means **the other player pays the 2 points**.

That makes sense: the other player **pays** the bonus for this player's A0 action.

So:
- When you play A0 → you get +2
- The other player loses 2
- When the other plays A0 → they get +2, you lose 2

This is consistent.

So, applying this **independent of who chooses what**.

So for the payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0              | A1             |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **A0**  | (5 – 2, 5 + 2) = (3, 7) | (0 – 2, 3 + 2) = (-2, 5) |
| **A1**  | (3 + 2, 0 – 2) = (5, –2) | (3 + 2, 3 + 2) = (5, 5) |

Now let’s break it down:

- **(A0, A0)**: both play A0 → P1 gets +2 (from P2), so his final payoff = 5 + 2 = 7  
  P2 gets +2 (from P1), so 5 + 2 = 7 → but wait, that would require **both paying each other** — so **P1 pays 2 to P2, P2 pays 2 to P1** → net zero for both? Contradiction!

Ah, here's the ambiguity.

Can a player simultaneously **receive** +2 from the other **and** **pay** 2 to the other?

Yes — if both play A0, then:
- P1 plays A0 → gets +2 from P2 → P2 pays 2 to P1
- P2 plays A0 → gets +2 from P1 → P1 pays 2 to P2

So net: P1 receives 2, pays 2 → net zero change  
P2 receives 2, pays 2 → net zero change

So the **net effect** of both playing A0 is **no change**: still (5,5)

Wait — but that contradicts the “drawn equally from the other players” clause.

Let’s reanalyze.

Suppose **one** player plays A0 → they receive +2 from the other.

Suppose **two players** both play A0 → each receives +2, each pays 2 → mutual exchange → no net change.

So in fact, the contract **only affects cases where only one player plays A0**.

This is crucial.

Let me formalize:

For any player:
- If they play A0 → they get +2
- This +2 is funded by the other player → so **the other player loses 2**

Therefore, for each action pair:

1. **(A0, A0)**:  
   - P1 plays A0 → gets +2, P2 pays 2  
   - P2 plays A0 → gets +2, P1 pays 2  
   → Net: both pay 2, receive 2 → net 0 change  
   → Final payoff: (5,5)

2. **(A0, A1)**:  
   - P1 plays A0 → gets +2 → P2 pays 2 → P1: 0 + 2 = **2**  
   - P2 plays A1 → no effect → so P2: 3  
   → But wait: P2 plays A1 → does not trigger +2 → so he does **not** get anything  
   → But P1 triggered a +2 → so P2 pays 2  
   → So: P1: 0 + 2 = 2  
   → P2: 3 – 2 = 1  
   → Result: (2, 1)

3. **(A1, A0)**:  
   - P1 plays A1 → no bonus → no cost
   - P2 plays A0 → gets +2 → paid by P1 → so P1 loses 2
   - P1 original: 3 → now 3 – 2 = 1
   - P2 original: 0 → now 0 + 2 = 2
   → Result: (1, 2)

4. **(A1, A1)**:
   - No one plays A0 → no bonuses
   → Payoffs remain (3,3)

Wait — but earlier we thought (A0,A1) gives P2 3 points originally → now 3 – 2 = 1?
Only if the other player (P1) plays A0 → P2 has to pay 2.

But in (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → so P2 must pay 2 → so P2 gets 3 – 2 = 1

Similarly, in (A1, A0): P2 plays A0 → P1 must pay 2 → so P1’s payoff drops by 2.

Let’s tabulate corrected matrix.

### Corrected Payoff Matrix Under Contract (C1 and C2):

| P1 \ P2 | A0          | A1        |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **A0** | (5, 5)      | (0 + 2, 3 – 2) = (2, 1) |
| **A1** | (3 – 2, 0 + 2) = (1, 2) | (3, 3) |

Explanation:
- (A0,A0): both play A0 → mutual +2/-2 → cancel out → (5,5)
- (A0,A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +2, P2 pays 2 → P1: 0+2=2, P2: 3–2=1 → (2,1)
- (A1,A0): P2 plays A0 → gets +2, P1 pays 2 → P1: 3–2=1, P2: 0+2=2 → (1,2)
- (A1,A1): no A0 → no changes → (3,3)

So final matrix after contract:

| P1 \ P2 | A0    | A1  |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **A0** | (5,5) | (2,1) |
| **A1** | (1,2) | (3,3) |

Now, recall: **you are Player 2**.

Your payoffs (second number in each pair):
- (A0,A0): 5
- (A0,A1): 1
- (A1,A0): 2
- (A1,A1): 3

So your expected payoff depending on choices:

You are deciding what to do — but also trying to predict what the other player might do, and assess whether the contract helps you.

But now, with the contract, your payoff function is different.

Let’s analyze possible outcomes.

What is the best outcome for **you** (Player 2)?

- If we both play A0: you get 5 ✅
- If we both play A1: you get 3
- If you play A1, other plays A0: you get 2
- If you play A0, other plays A1: you get 1 ❌

So A0 is better when others play A0 (get 5), worse when they play A1 (get only 1)

Now let’s look at **best responses** for you:

- If other plays A0 → you can:
  - A0 → get 5
  - A1 → get 2
  → Best: A0

- If other plays A1 → you can:
  - A0 → get 1
  - A1 → get 3
  → Best: A1

So still, no dominant strategy — depends on belief.

But notice: under the contract, **coordinating on A0** is still very attractive for you — because you get 5.

And if you both end up on A0, everything cancels and you still get 5.

In contrast, if you miscoordinate, you get only 1 or 2 — worse.

But compare to the **original game**, where miscoordination gave you 0 or 3.

Under contract:
- Miscoordination where you play A0 and other plays A1: you only get **1**, whereas originally you got 0 — so **worse for you**.
- Miscoordination where you play A1 and other plays A0: you get 2 instead of 0 — **better**.

So net effect:
- You **lose** in the case where you play A0 and other plays A1
- You **gain** in the case where you play A1 and other plays A0

But since you **like high payoffs**, and A0/A0 is good (5), and you want to avoid getting low, you have incentive to coordinate.

Now consider: **would you like this contract?**

Yes — because:
- It reinforces A0 as a good choice *when you think the other will follow*
- Even though you get only 1 in the worst case (vs 0 before), that's not terrible
- You still get 5 in the good case

But more importantly: **the contract makes playing A0 even more rewarding when the other doesn't play A0**, right?

Wait — no, actually, when you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get only 1 — which is worse than original (0). So **you are worse off** in that scenario.

But you are also rewarded when the other plays A0 and you play A1: from 0 to 2.

So overall?

Let’s simulate strategic thinking.

Suppose you expect the other to play **A0** with high probability.

Then:
- If you play A0 → get 5
- If you play A1 → get 2
→ Clearly prefer A0

Suppose you expect the other to play **A1** with high probability.
- If you play A0 → get 1
- If you play A1 → get 3
→ Still prefer A1

So the contract doesn’t change your best response structure — but **shifts payoffs**.

But crucially: the **coordination equilibrium (A0,A0)** remains strong: both get 5.

Also, **(A1,A1)** gives you 3 — still good.

But the **dilemma is**: without a way to coordinate, you risk getting only 1 or 2.

But now, since both contracts are **identical in effect**, and they both lead to the same revised payoff matrix, **you should be indifferent between C1 and C2 in terms of effect**.

But wait: **why are two contracts being proposed?**

C1: proposed by Player 1  
C2: proposed by Player 2

And you are **Player 2**.

Now, the key point: **the contract is binding only if both players agree.**

But the mechanism is: **winning contract selected uniformly at random among those with maximum approvals.**

So if you approve a contract, it increases its chance of being chosen.

But you are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**, which depends on:
- Whether a contract gets approved (and which one)
- What equilibrium arises under that contract

Let’s suppose you decide to **approve both C1 and C2**.

Since they are identical, if you approve both, and no one else approves C1, but someone else approves C2, then C2 might win.

But since both contracts are **mechanically identical**, and you are the same player, it doesn't matter which one wins — payoff is the same.

So in terms of **outcome**, approving either leads to same result.

But here’s the catch: **do you trust the proposer?**

C1 is proposed by Player 1 — maybe you don’t trust him?

But the contract is symmetric in effect regardless of proposer — it just defines the rules.

So **as long as you care about your own payoff**, and both contracts have **same effect**, then **you should approve both** — because you don’t lose by doing so, and you increase the chance of getting a beneficial contract.

Wait — but what if the contract isn't fair?

But the contract says: **"If a player chooses A0, they receive +2, drawn equally from the other players."**

So it applies to **both players equally**.

It's **symmetric**.

So the contract treats both players identically.

Therefore, **it doesn’t favor Player 1 or Player 2**.

Therefore, you, as Player 2, have **no reason not to approve** it.

Moreover, if you approve it, then:
- The contract may pass
- And then you play under a better environment?

Wait — is it **actually better**?

Compare expected payoff under contract vs without.

But without contract, we had the original game.

In the original game, you face uncertainty.

But with contract, you still face uncertainty, but the payoffs are altered.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and try to maximize their own payoffs.

Let’s find **Nash equilibria under the contract**.

Payoff table (you are Player 2):

| P1 \ P2 | A0    | A1  |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **A0** | (5,5) | (2,1) |
| **A1** | (1,2) | (3,3) |

Best responses for **you (Player 2)**:

- If P1 plays A0: you can get 5 (A0) or 1 (A1) → best: A0
- If P1 plays A1: you can get 2 (A0) or 3 (A1) → best: A1

So **no dominant strategy**.

But now: can we find pure-strategy equilibria?

Try (A0,A0):
- P1: given P2 plays A0, best response is A0 (5 > 1) → okay
- P2: given P1 plays A0, best response is A0 (5 > 1) → okay
→ **(A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium**

Try (A1,A1):
- P1: given P2 plays A1, best: A1 (3 > 2) → okay
- P2: given P1 plays A1, best: A1 (3 > 2) → okay
→ **(A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium**

Are there mixed-strategy equilibria?

Yes — possibly.

But notice: **both equilibria exist**, and (A0,A0) gives you **5**, while (A1,A1) gives **3** — so **you prefer (A0,A0)**.

With contract, you still need to **coordinate on A0**.

But now: is there **more incentive** to coordinate?

Compared to original game:

Original game:
- (A0,A0): both get 5 → good
- (A1,A1): both get 3 → also good
- But no (A1,A0) or (A0,A1) in equilibrium — both players have incentive to deviate unless coordinated.

But under contract, the **incentives to miscoordinate are reduced**?

No — but in fact, the **bad outcomes are worse for you** when you play A0 vs A1.

Specifically, in (A0,A1): you play A0, other plays A1 → you get only **1** (down from 0) — so **worse**.

So your **risk of getting a low payoff is higher** under the contract.

But in return, when you play A1 and other plays A0, you go from 0 → 2 — better.

So it’s a trade-off.

But overall, the **expected payoff depends on strategy**.

But you, as Player 2, cannot force the other player to cooperate.

But you can try to signal cooperation.

Important: **if you know the contract is in place, you might be more willing to play A0, hoping the other does too.**

But the other knows that too.

So **there is still a risk**.

However, **since you get 5 in (A0,A0)**, which is the maximum possible, and it’s sustainable via equilibrium, and **you benefit from the contract when you play A0 (even if other plays A1)** — wait, no: if **you** play A0 and other plays A1, you get only 1 — **which is worse than original 0**.

That’s critical.

So **you are worse off** in the scenario where you play A0 and the other plays A1.

Therefore, **unless you are confident the other plays A0**, you are **hurt** by the contract.

Whereas in original game, you got 0 — now you get 1.

Wait — 1 is **better** than 0.

So **you are better off** in that case.

But if you play A0 and other plays A1: you get 1 instead of 0 → **better**
If you play A1 and other plays A0: you get 2 instead of 0 → **better**
Only when you play A0 and other plays A0: you get 5 (same as before)
When you play A1 and other plays A1: you get 3 (same as before)

So **under the contract, you never get worse off** — in every outcome, you get **equal or better** payoff!

Let’s check:

- (A0,A0): 5 → same → ok
- (A0,A1): 1 > 0 → better
- (A1,A0): 2 > 0 → better
- (A1,A1): 3 → same

So under contract, **you strictly improve in two cases, unchanged in two**.

Therefore, **this contract is always at least as good as the original**, and **strictly better in two scenarios**.

So **you are strictly better off** in expectation, **regardless** of what the other player does.

Therefore, **you should approve any contract that implements this.**

Even if you’re unsure what the other player does, the contract improves your payoff in all cases.

Hence, **a rational self-interested Player 2 should approve both contracts.**

Even though C1 was proposed by Player 1 and C2 by Player 2 — but the contract is symmetric, so both are equivalent.

Therefore, **approving both increases the chance that a good contract (for you) is adopted.**

And since both contracts are **identical in effect**, approving both is safe and beneficial.

---

### Final Decision:

You should approve **both contracts**.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract or not, we need to analyze the payoffs in both scenarios - with and without the contract.

### No Contract Scenario
In the base game without the contract, the payoffs for each combination of actions are as follows:
- If both players choose A0: 5 points each.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, and they get 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, and they get 0 points.
- If both players choose A1: 3 points each.

### With Contract Scenario
Under the contract, there is an additional payment adjustment if either player chooses A0:
- If you choose A0, you get an extra 1 point, while the other player loses 1 point.
- If the other player chooses A0, they get an extra 1 point, while you lose 1 point.

Let's analyze the new payoffs when the contract is active:
- If both choose A0: You get 6 points and the other player gets 4 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 1 point (0+1) and the other player gets 2 points (3-1).
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 2 points (3-1) and the other player gets 1 point (0+1).
- If both choose A1: You get 3 points and the other player gets 3 points (no change from the base game).

### Payoff Matrix Comparison

| Action Pair        | No Contract Payoff   | With Contract Payoff   |

| (A1, A1)           | (3, 3)               | (3, 3)                 |

### Expected Outcomes under Rational Play
The contract incentivizes both players to choose A0 because they receive an additional point for this choice. The Nash equilibrium in the base game without the contract is both players choosing A1, yielding (3, 3). With the contract, the new equilibrium is more attractive at (6, 4).

### Final Decision
From your perspective (Player 1), signing the contract is beneficial because:
1. It changes the equilibrium payoff from (3, 3) to (6, 4).
2. You have better outcomes by incentivizing the choice of A0 over A1.

### Conclusion
Given that you have calculated the payoffs and the strategic incentives under both scenarios, the contract seems to be beneficial for you to maximize your total points.

With this analysis, the decision is to sign the contract.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to evaluate the potential outcomes with and without the contract.

### Without the Contract
In the original game rules, the payoffs are as follows:
- If both players choose A0: both get 5 points.
- If Player 1 (P1) chooses A0 and Player 2 (P2) chooses A1: P1 gets 0 points, P2 gets 3 points.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 3 points, P2 gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: both get 3 points.

### With the Contract
The contract adds an additional payment structure:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, which is subtracted from the other player.

Thus, the payoffs with the contract are adjusted as follows:
- If both players choose A0: both get \(5 + 2 - 2 = 5\) points.
- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: P1 gets \(0 + 2 = 2\) points, P2 gets \(3 - 2 = 1\) point.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: P1 gets \(3 - 2 = 1\) point, P2 gets \(0 + 2 = 2\) points.
- If both choose A1: both get 3 points (no change).

### Analysis
Given the payoffs without and with the contract, let's summarize the changes:

1. **If both players choose A0:**
   - Payoff remains the same at 5 points each.

2. **If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1:**
   - Without contract: P1 = 0, P2 = 3.
   - With contract: P1 = 2, P2 = 1.
   - P1 improves by 2 points, P2 is worse off by 2 points.

3. **If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0:**
   - Without contract: P1 = 3, P2 = 0.
   - With contract: P1 = 1, P2 = 2.
   - P1 is worse off by 2 points, P2 improves by 2 points.

4. **If both choose A1:**
   - No change, both receive 3 points.

Let's break down the incentives:

- **Without Contract:**
  - Dominant strategy for both would be to play A1 due to the guaranteed 3 points, assuming the other player might also play A1.

- **With Contract:**
  - Probability reshuffling needs to be considered.
  - If each player chooses A0, the net gain or loss is zero due to the additional payments.

Given the incentives:
- Both playing A0 nets zero additional gain but gives no incentive to deviation.
- If one chooses A0 and the other A1, the payoffs lead to suboptimal decisions compared to both choosing A1.
- The payoffs with the contract appear unchanged in terms of dominant behavior but offer additional complications.

With the contract, players might still be inclined to mutual cooperation (A0) due to even distributions. The safety net of receiving a slight boost may still incentivize playing A0 more frequently, allowing balanced plays.

### Decision Making
Evaluating whether the contract changes fundamental payoffs, the equilibrium strategies remain aligned, maximizing a fairness offer on choices of A0.

```json
{"sign": true}
```

By signing, the game should be more predictable, encouraging incremental cooperation.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
```
                P1 plays A0    P1 plays A1
I play A0:      (5, 5)         (0, 3)
I play A1:      (3, 0)         (3, 3)
```

Key observations:
- (A0, A0) gives both players 5 points - the best mutual outcome
- (A1, A1) gives both players 3 points - a worse but stable outcome
- There's a coordination problem: both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash equilibria

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1 adds +2 to any player choosing A0 (paid by the other player).

New payoffs:
```
                P1 plays A0    P1 plays A1
I play A0:      (5, 5)         (2, 1)
I play A1:      (1, 2)         (3, 3)
```

Effects:
- The (A0, A0) outcome remains at (5, 5)
- Deviating from (A0, A0) to A1 drops my payoff from 5 to 1 (worse than base game's 3)
- This makes (A0, A0) MORE stable and attractive

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2 charges -1 to any player choosing A1 (paid to the other player).

New payoffs:
```
                P1 plays A0    P1 plays A1
I play A0:      (5, 5)         (1, 2)
I play A1:      (2, 1)         (3, 3)
```

Effects:
- The (A0, A0) outcome remains at (5, 5)
- Deviating from (A0, A0) to A1 drops my payoff from 5 to 2 (worse than base game's 3)
- This also makes (A0, A0) MORE stable

## Step 4: Compare Outcomes

Both contracts:
- Preserve the optimal (A0, A0) outcome at 5 points each
- Penalize deviations from the cooperative A0 strategy
- Help coordinate on the better equilibrium
- Are symmetric in their effects on both players

Contract 1 is slightly stronger in discouraging deviation (payoff drops to 1 vs 2), but both improve coordination toward the mutually beneficial outcome.

## Conclusion

Both contracts help achieve the best outcome without harming me. I should approve both.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to carefully analyze the impact of the contract on our expected payoffs in the game. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. Default Payoff Matrix (No Contract)
First, let's consider the payoff matrix without the contract:
- If Player 1 (P1) chooses A0 and Player 2 (P2) chooses A0: P1 gets 5 points, P2 gets 5 points.
- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 0 points, P2 gets 3 points.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 3 points, P2 gets 0 points.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A1: both get 3 points.

#### 2. Payoff Matrix with the Contract
The contract specifies a payment structure where if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points drawn from the other player:
- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 5 + 2 = 7 points, P2 gets 5 + 2 = 7 points.
- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 0 + 2 = 2 points, P2 gets 3 - 2 = 1 point.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 3 - 2 = 1 point, P2 gets 0 + 2 = 2 points.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A1: both get 3 points (no additional payments).

#### 3. Analysis of Incentives
- Without the contract, choosing A0 when both players choose A0 yields 5 points each, which is the highest possible mutual benefit.
- With the contract, choosing A0 potentially increases the payoff when both players choose A0 to 7 points each, and decreases the payoff disparity when one chooses A0 and the other A1 or vice versa.

#### 4. Rational Decision-Making
Both players will likely aim to maximize their payoffs:
- The contract incentivizes choosing A0 since the additional 2 points enhances the total payoff in cases where both choose A0, and minimizes the losses where one chooses A1 and the other A0.

#### 5. Conclusion
The contract aligns both players' incentives towards a mutual benefit situation (both choosing A0), which increases the expected payoff for Player 1. Therefore, signing the contract appears beneficial for Player 1.

### Final Decision
Based on the analysis, signing the contract improves the expected payoffs, thus we should sign the contract.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing my points, let’s break down the game step by step, considering both the original payoffs and the additional points from the contract.

### Basic Game Analysis Without Contract
First, let's look at the game without the contract. Here’s the payoff matrix for both players:

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & \text{Other chooses A0} & \text{Other chooses A1} \\
\hline
\text{You choose A0} & 5, 5 & 0, 3 \\
\text{You choose A1} & 3, 0 & 3, 3 \\
\end{array}
\]

### Impact of the Contract
Due to the contract, if a player chooses A0, they receive an extra 2 points, which is deducted from the other player. This changes the effective payoff matrix as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & \text{Other chooses A0} & \text{Other chooses A1} \\
\hline
\text{You choose A0} & (5+2, 5-2) = 7, 3 & (0+2, 3-2) = 2, 1 \\
\text{You choose A1} & (3, 0) = 3, 0 & (3, 3) = 3, 3 \\
\end{array}
\]

### Revised Payoff Matrix
So our revised payoff matrix becomes:

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & \text{Other chooses A0} & \text{Other chooses A1} \\
\hline
\text{You choose A0} & 7, 3 & 2, 1 \\
\text{You choose A1} & 3, 0 & 3, 3 \\
\end{array}
\]

### Strategy Analysis
- If I choose A0:
  * If the other chooses A0, I get 7 points.
  * If the other chooses A1, I get 2 points.

- If I choose A1:
  * If the other chooses A0, I get 3 points.
  * If the other chooses A1, I get 3 points.

Based on this revised matrix, consistently choosing A0 will give me the highest potential for maximizing points because:
1. I stand to gain significantly more points when both players choose A0.
2. Even in the worst-case scenario (the other player chooses A1), I still get 2 points, which is not a bad outcome compared to getting 3 points in an optimal scenario with A1.

Therefore, choosing A0 provides the best strategy in this modified game with the contract in place.

### Decision
Given this reasoning, I should opt for a high probability of choosing A0.

### Final Answer
```json
{
  "A0": 100,
  "A1": 0
}
```

This probability distribution maximizes the points I am likely to receive given the game's structure and the contract's impact.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 0, 3  
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

This game has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → both get 5 (best outcome)
- (A1, A1) → both get 3 (worse outcome)

There's a **coordination problem**: we both want (A0, A0) but risk mis-coordination.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With +1 payment for choosing A0:
- (A0, A0): 5+1-1=5, 5+1-1=5
- (A0, A1): 0+1=1, 3-1=2
- (A1, A0): 3-1=2, 0+1=1  
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

This still has two pure Nash equilibria at (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While C1 makes A0 slightly more attractive relative to A1, it **doesn't eliminate the coordination risk**. The mixed strategy equilibrium under C1 yields only about 2.6 points.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

With +4 payment for choosing A0:
- (A0, A0): 5+4-4=5, 5+4-4=5
- (A0, A1): 0+4=4, 3-4=-1
- (A1, A0): 3-4=-1, 0+4=4
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

Now A0 becomes a **dominant strategy** for both players:
- When other plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs -1 from A1
- When other plays A1: I get 4 from A0 vs 3 from A1

C2 creates a **unique Nash equilibrium at (A0, A0)**, guaranteeing 5 points for both players with no coordination risk!

## Step 4: Strategic decision

- **C2 is strictly better**: It guarantees the optimal outcome (5 points) by making A0 dominant
- **C1 is weaker**: Still has coordination risk and uncertainty
- Approving both C1 and C2 would risk C1 being randomly selected, which could result in coordination failure
- I should approve only C2 to maximize my expected payoff

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze how it affects the incentives and payoffs of the game.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this version, there are two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria:
1. **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5 points.
2. **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3 points.

While (A0, A0) is the better outcome, choosing A0 is risky. If the other player chooses A1, the player who chose A0 receives 0 points. Conversely, choosing A1 is safe because it guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's decision. This risk often pushes players to choose A1 to avoid the 0-point outcome.

### 2. Analysis of the Contract
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other players."

If both players sign, the payouts change as follows:
- **(A0, A0):** Each chooses A0. Each receives 1 point and pays 1 point. Net change is 0. Payoff: **(5, 5)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 (+1 point), Player 2 chooses A1 (-1 point). Payoff: (0+1, 3-1) = **(1, 2)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1 (-1 point), Player 2 chooses A0 (+1 point). Payoff: (3-1, 0+1) = **(2, 1)**.
- **(A1, A1):** Neither chooses A0. No change. Payoff: **(3, 3)**.

### 3. Impact of the Contract
Comparing the original and contract payoffs for Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 5 (same), A1 gives 2 (instead of 3).
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 1 (instead of 0), A1 gives 3 (same).

The contract makes A0 more attractive by increasing its minimum payoff (the "risk" side) and makes A1 less attractive by decreasing its payoff when the other player chooses A0. This shift in incentives strongly encourages coordination on the superior (A0, A0) equilibrium.

### 4. Strategic Decision
As Player 2, you proposed this contract to improve the likelihood of reaching the (A0, A0) outcome. Since the contract reduces the risk of choosing A0 and penalizes staying with the "safe" A1 strategy, it facilitates a more profitable outcome for both players. To maximize total points, both players should sign the contract and choose A0.

First incorporate the contract into your (Player 2) payoffs:

- If **you** choose **A0**, you gain **+2** (taken from Player 1).
- If **Player 1** chooses **A0**, you lose **2** (paid to Player 1).
- Choosing **A1** causes no transfers.

So your effective payoff matrix becomes:

- (P2 A0, P1 A0): \(5 + 2 - 2 = 5\)
- (P2 A0, P1 A1): \(0 + 2 = 2\)
- (P2 A1, P1 A0): \(3 - 2 = 1\)
- (P2 A1, P1 A1): \(3\)

Now compute the mixed strategy that makes Player 1 indifferent (i.e., the Nash equilibrium mix).

Let \(p\) = probability Player 1 plays A0.

Your expected payoff if you play:
- **A0**: \(U(A0)=5p + 2(1-p)=2+3p\)
- **A1**: \(U(A1)=1p + 3(1-p)=3-2p\)

Indifference condition:
\[
2+3p = 3-2p \Rightarrow 5p = 1 \Rightarrow p = 0.2
\]

By symmetry, you should also play A0 with probability 0.2.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Analyze the base game equilibria

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5 - Pareto optimal
- **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3

The challenge is coordinating on the better outcome.

## Step 3: Check which equilibrium is risk-dominant

Risk dominance considers: if I'm uncertain what the opponent will do, which action is safer?

For the original game:
- If I play A0 but opponent plays A1: I get 0 (very bad!)
- If I play A1 but opponent plays A0: I get 3 (not bad)

The **risk-dominant equilibrium** is (A1, A1) because A1 is the "safer" choice - it guarantees at least 3 points.

## Step 4: Analyze the contracts (C1 and C2 are identical)

Both contracts add: "+1 point if you play A0, paid by the opponent"

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 + 1 - 1 = 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 1 = 1 ✓ (improved!)
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 1 = 2
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 5: Check risk-dominance with the contract

Now:
- If I play A0 but opponent plays A1: I get 1 (much better than 0!)
- If I play A1 but opponent plays A0: I get 2

With the contract, **(A0, A0) becomes risk-dominant** because:
- Gain from deviating from (A0, A0) to A1: 5 → 2 = -3
- Gain from deviating from (A1, A1) to A0: 3 → 1 = -2

## Step 6: Conclusion

The contracts shift the risk-dominant equilibrium from (A1, A1) to (A0, A0). This helps both players coordinate on the Pareto-optimal outcome where we both get 5 points instead of 3.

The key benefit: the contract reduces the downside risk of playing A0, making it the safer choice and facilitating coordination on the better equilibrium.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

The base game payoff matrix (my payoff, other's payoff):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)  
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This game has multiple Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5) - **best outcome**
- (A1, A1) with payoffs (3, 3) - **safe but suboptimal**

The challenge is coordinating on the better equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

With C1, payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): (5+1-1, 5+1-1) = (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0+1, 3-1) = (1, 2)
- (A1, A0): (3-1, 0+1) = (2, 1)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) ✓
- (A1, A1): (3, 3) ✓
- Mixed strategy equilibrium also exists with expected payoff ≈ 2.6

**Problem**: C1 maintains multiple equilibria and even adds a worse mixed equilibrium. It doesn't solve the coordination problem.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

With C2, payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): (5+5-5, 5+5-5) = (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0+5, 3-5) = (5, -2)
- (A1, A0): (3-5, 0+5) = (-2, 5)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

Check for Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): Neither player wants to deviate (would get -2 instead of 5) ✓
- (A1, A1): Each player would want to deviate to A0 (would get 5 instead of 3) ✗

**Result**: C2 creates a **unique Nash equilibrium** at (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5). This eliminates coordination risk.

## Step 4: Decision

- **C1**: Doesn't improve coordination and adds an inferior equilibrium. Not helpful.
- **C2**: Solves the coordination problem by making (A0, A0) the dominant strategy equilibrium with maximum payoff of 5 for both players.

I should approve C2 only.

Let's break down this decision-making game one step at a time:

### Game Analysis Without Additional Payments

**Payoff Table Without Contract Payments:**
1. (A0, A0) → Player 1: 5 points, Player 2: 5 points
2. (A0, A1) → Player 1: 0 points, Player 2: 3 points
3. (A1, A0) → Player 1: 3 points, Player 2: 0 points
4. (A1, A1) → Player 1: 3 points, Player 2: 3 points

### Contract Influence:

**With Contract Payments:**
- If Player 1 chooses A0: they receive 1 additional point (taken from Player 2)
- If Player 2 chooses A0: they receive 1 additional point (taken from Player 1)

Updated Payoff Table with Contract Payments:
1. (A0, A0) → Player 1: 6 points, Player 2: 4 points
2. (A0, A1) → Player 1: 1 point, Player 2: 3 points
3. (A1, A0) → Player 1: 3 points, Player 2: -1 points
4. (A1, A1) → Player 1: 3 points, Player 2: 3 points

Now let's calculate the expected payoff for each strategy based on the probability distribution (assuming Player 1's strategy):

Let \( p \) be the probability for Player 1 to choose A0, hence \( 1-p \) is the probability for Player 1 to choose A1.
Let \( q \) be the probability for Player 2 to choose A0, hence \( 1-q \) is the probability for Player 2 to choose A1.

### To Maximize Player 1's Expected Payoff:

\[ E(U_1) = pq(6) + p(1-q)(1) + (1-p)q(3) + (1-p)(1-q)(3) \]

Simplifying the expected payoff function:

\[ E(U_1) = 6pq + p - pq + 3q - 3pq + 3 - 3p - 3q + 3pq \]
\[ E(U_1) = 6pq + 3 + p - 3p \]
\[ E(U_1) = 6pq + 3 - 2p \]

### Equilibrium Setup:

To find the optimal \( p \) and \( q \), consider Player 2’s perspective and iterate through possible strategies. Player 2's payoff maximization similarly:

\[ E(U_2) = pq(4) + p(1-q)(3) + (1-p)q(-1) + (1-p)(1-q)(3) \]

Simplifying:

\[ E(U_2) = 4pq + 3p - 3pq - q + pq + 3 - 3p + q - pq \]
\[ E(U_2) = 4pq + 3 - 3p + 3p - pq \]
\[ E(U_2) = 4pq + 3 - pq \]

Upon reviewing, balance likely shifts towards A0 and A1 due to higher mutual or diverging payoffs.

Simulating typical scenarios and mathematical solving:
We should recognize:
- Strategy prone to cooperative stability.
- Balance fits equal advantage use.

Optimal mixed-action modeling:
Equalization: Fair for each predict \( 50\% \).

Given equilibria:
{\(0.5, 0.5 \)}

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

The original payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 points ← Best mutual outcome
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0  
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 points

This has two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1), with (A0, A0) being better for both players.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

Under C1, payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 5, 5 (I receive +1, pay -1, net 0)
- (A0, A1): 1, 2 (I receive +1 from choosing A0)
- (A1, A0): 2, 1 (I pay -1 to other's A0)
- (A1, A1): 3, 3 (no change)

Testing if I prefer A0:
- If other plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs 2 from A1 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 1 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → prefer A1

To find the threshold: I prefer A0 when 4p + 1 > 3 - p (where p = probability other plays A0), which means p > 0.4.

**C1 makes (A0, A0) risk-dominant** - I only need 40% confidence the other player chooses A0 to prefer A0 myself. This promotes coordination on the good equilibrium.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

Under C2, payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 3, 0 (I receive +1 and +2 from other's A1 penalty)
- (A1, A0): 0, 3 (I pay -2 and -1 to other's A0 bonus)
- (A1, A1): 3, 3 (I pay -2 and receive +2, net 0)

Testing if I prefer A0:
- If other plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs 0 from A1 → strongly prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 3 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → indifferent

**A0 weakly dominates A1 under C2** - there's no reason to ever play A1, so both rational players will choose A0, guaranteeing the (A0, A0) outcome with 5 points each.

## Step 4: Compare Outcomes

- **No contract**: (A1, A1) is risk-dominant (need 60% confidence for A0), likely outcome is 3 points
- **C1**: (A0, A0) is risk-dominant (need only 40% confidence), very likely outcome is 5 points  
- **C2**: A0 is dominant strategy, guaranteed outcome is 5 points

## Step 5: Decision

Both contracts are strictly better than no contract:
- C2 provides the strongest guarantee (5 points certain)
- C1 significantly improves coordination on the good equilibrium (5 points very likely)

Since both contracts improve my expected payoff, I should approve both.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to evaluate how it influences the payoffs for both Player 1 and Player 2. Let’s go through the decision-making process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix Without Contract
Without the contract, the payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): Player 2: 5, Player 1: 5
- (A0, A1): Player 2: 0, Player 1: 3
- (A1, A0): Player 2: 3, Player 1: 0
- (A1, A1): Player 2: 3, Player 1: 3

### Step 2: Understanding the Contract
The contract adds or subtracts points based on the choices:
- Choosing A0: Gain an additional 1 point
- Choosing A1: Lose 2 points

These point changes need to be distributed equally among the players:
- If both players choose A0, they each gain 0.5 points from the other.
- If both players choose A1, they each lose 1 point to the other (which balances out to -2 points each).

### Step 3: Payoff Matrix with Contract
Now, let's recalculate the payoffs including the contract:

- (A0, A0): Player 2: \( 5 + 1 = 6 \), Player 1: \( 5 + 1 = 6 \)
- (A0, A1): Player 2: \( 0 + 1 - 1 = 0 \), Player 1: \( 3 - 2 + 0.5 = 1.5 \)
- (A1, A0): Player 2: \( 3 - 2 + 0.5 = 1.5 \), Player 1: \( 0 + 1 - 1 = 0 \)
- (A1, A1): Player 2: \( 3 - 2 - 1 = 0 \), Player 1: \( 3 - 2 - 1 = 0 \)

### Step 4: Analyzing the Benefits
Compare the payoffs with and without the contract:

- (A0, A0):
  - Without: Player 2: 5, Player 1: 5
  - With: Player 2: 6, Player 1: 6
  
- (A0, A1):
  - Without: Player 2: 0, Player 1: 3
  - With: Player 2: 0, Player 1: 1.5

- (A1, A0):
  - Without: Player 2: 3, Player 1: 0
  - With: Player 2: 1.5, Player 1: 0

- (A1, A1):
  - Without: Player 2: 3, Player 1: 3
  - With: Player 2: 0, Player 1: 0

### Step 5: Evaluating Strategic Choices
The contract shifts incentives:
- (A0, A0) provides higher total points under the contract.
- Other strategies tend to reduce the total points when both players choose non-cooperatively.

The dominant strategy now is both players choosing A0 for the highest combined payoff.

### Step 6: Decision to Sign
Given that the contract incentivizes both players to select A0, which maximizes the total points for both players, it would be beneficial to sign the contract. Therefore:

Let me analyze this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs

Without any contract, my payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- +4 points to whoever plays A0 (paid by the other player)
- No payment for A1

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 4 (I get for my A0) - 4 (I pay for their A0) = **5**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 4 (I get for my A0) = **4**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 4 (I pay for their A0) = **-1**
- (A1, A1): 3 = **3**

## Step 3: Analyze strategic implications

**Without contract:**
- No dominant strategy
- Two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5, and (A1, A1) giving 3
- Coordination problem - risk of miscoordination

**With contract:**
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → A0 is better
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → A0 is better
- **A0 becomes a dominant strategy!**

The same logic applies to the other player, so both players will choose A0.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: Best case is 5 (if we coordinate on A0, A0), but risk of getting 0 or 3
- **With contract**: Guaranteed 5 (A0 becomes dominant for both players)

## Step 5: Decision

The contract:
- Ensures the efficient outcome (both play A0, both get 5)
- Eliminates coordination risk
- Only activates if both sign (no downside if other doesn't sign)
- Guarantees my best possible payoff

**Conclusion: I should sign the contract.**

Let's break down the problem step by step, examining the game both with and without the contract.

**Step 1: Understand the initial payoff matrix (without the contract)**
|        | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **P1 A0** | (5, 5)     | (0, 3)     |
| **P1 A1** | (3, 0)     | (3, 3)     |

**Step 2: Understand the payoff matrix with the contract (if both players sign)**
With the contract, if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points and the other player loses 1 point for each action:
|        | Player 2 A0       | Player 2 A1       |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **P1 A0** | (5 + 2 - 1, 5 - 1 + 2) = (6, 6)     | (0 + 2 - 1, 3 - 1 + 2) = (1, 4)   |
| **P1 A1** | (3 - 1, 0 + 2) = (2, 2)     | (3, 3)     |

So the modified matrix with the contract becomes:
|        | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **P1 A0** | (6, 6)     | (1, 4)     |
| **P1 A1** | (2, 2)     | (3, 3)     |

**Step 3: Analyze the difference in strategies**
- **Without Contract**:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0:
    - Player 2 A0 gives (5, 5).
    - Player 2 A1 gives (0, 3).
  - If Player 1 chooses A1:
    - Player 2 A0 gives (3, 0).
    - Player 2 A1 gives (3, 3).
- **With Contract**:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0:
    - Player 2 A0 gives (6, 6).
    - Player 2 A1 gives (1, 4).
  - If Player 1 chooses A1:
    - Player 2 A0 gives (2, 2).
    - Player 2 A1 gives (3, 3).

**Step 4: Determine optimal play without contract**
- Without the contract, Player 1 and Player 2 aiming to maximize their payoffs would both prefer the actions (A0, A0) resulting in (5, 5).

**Step 5: Determine optimal play with contract**
- With the contract, evaluating the highest payoffs:
  - (A0, A0) yields (6, 6).
  - (A1, A1) yields (3, 3).

**Step 6: Compare strategies for signing the contract**
- By signing the contract, both players achieve the maximum combined score in the (A0, A0) scenario, leading to (6, 6), which is better than (5, 5) achieved without the contract.
- Player 1's dominant strategy with the contract is still A0 considering the values (6, 1) more beneficial than (3, 2). Player 2 also maximizes utility at A0 post-contract.

**Conclusion:**
Given that signing the contract leads to a better outcome for both players when both players choose A0, it is rational for Player 1 to sign the contract.

First incorporate the contract’s transfer into your (Player 2’s) payoffs:

- If you play **A0**, you receive **+4** from Player 1.
- If Player 1 plays **A0**, you pay **4** to Player 1.
- If both play **A0**, the transfers cancel (you both pay/receive 4), so net transfer is 0.

So your adjusted payoffs are:

- (You A0, Other A0): \(5\)  
- (You A0, Other A1): \(0 + 4 = 4\)  
- (You A1, Other A0): \(3 - 4 = -1\)  
- (You A1, Other A1): \(3\)

Let \(q\) be the probability the other player chooses A0.

- If you choose **A0**:  \(5q + 4(1-q) = 4 + q\)
- If you choose **A1**:  \((-1)q + 3(1-q) = 3 - 4q\)

Compare: \(4+q \ge 3-4q \iff 5q \ge -1\), which is true for all \(q \in [0,1]\).  
So **A0 strictly dominates A1**; the best strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
To determine whether Player 2 should sign the contract, we first analyze the payoff structure of the original game and how the contract modifies it.

### 1. Original Game Analysis
The payoffs for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2) in the format (P1, P2) are:
*   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 3) — From P2's perspective: "You (P2) choose A1, other (P1) chooses A0, you get 3, other gets 0."
*   (A1, A0): (3, 0) — From P2's perspective: "You (P2) choose A0, other (P1) chooses A1, you get 0, other gets 3."
*   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two Nash Equilibria:
1.  **(A0, A0)**: Yields 5 points each. This is the Pareto optimal outcome.
2.  **(A1, A1)**: Yields 3 points each. This is the "safe" outcome, as playing A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's move.

For P2, playing A0 is risky because they receive 0 if P1 plays A1. To prefer A0, P2 must believe there is at least a 60% probability that P1 will also play A0.

### 2. Contract Analysis
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive +1 point, drawn from the other player. If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments."

If both players sign, the modified payoffs become:
*   **(A0, A0)**: (5 + 1 - 1, 5 + 1 - 1) = **(5, 5)**
*   **(A0, A1)**: (0 - 1, 3 + 1) = **(-1, 4)** — Wait, let's re-calculate. If P1=A0 and P2=A1, P1 gets +1, P2 gets -1. (0+1, 3-1) = **(1, 2)**. Let's re-examine that.
    *   (P1:A0, P2:A1): Original (0, 3). P1 chooses A0, so P1 gets +1 and P2 gets -1. New: (1, 2).
    *   (P1:A1, P2:A0): Original (3, 0). P2 chooses A0, so P2 gets +1 and P1 gets -1. New: (2, 1).
*   **(A1, A1)**: Original **(3, 3)**. No one chooses A0. New: **(3, 3)**.

### 3. Comparison
With the contract, Player 2's payoffs are:
*   If they choose **A0**: 5 (if P1 plays A0) or 1 (if P1 plays A1).
*   If they choose **A1**: 2 (if P1 plays A0) or 3 (if P1 plays A1).

Now, Player 2 only needs to believe there is a 40% probability that P1 will play A0 to make A0 the better choice (since $5p + 1(1-p) > 2p + 3(1-p) \Rightarrow 5p > 2 \Rightarrow p > 0.4$).

### Conclusion
The contract effectively reduces the risk of trying to coordinate on the high-payoff equilibrium (A0, A0) and penalizes the safe-but-low-payoff strategy (A1). Since both players ultimately want to reach (A0, A0), signing the contract is a rational move to facilitate that coordination.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs (for me, Player 2)

|           | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| I play A0 | 5             | 0             |
| I play A1 | 3             | 3             |

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- If I choose A0: I receive +2 from the other player
- If the other player chooses A0: I pay -2 to them

Modified payoffs for me:

|           | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| I play A0 | 5+2-2 = 5     | 0+2 = 2       |
| I play A1 | 3-2 = 1       | 3             |

## Step 3: Analyze pure strategy Nash equilibria

**Without contract:**
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 ✓ Nash equilibrium
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 ✓ Nash equilibrium

**With contract:**
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 ✓ Nash equilibrium  
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 ✓ Nash equilibrium

The pure strategy equilibria don't change.

## Step 4: Analyze mixed strategy equilibrium

**Without contract:** For indifference, I need:
- 5q = 3, so q = 3/5
- Mixed Nash: both play A0 with probability 3/5
- Expected payoff: 3 points

**With contract:** For indifference:
- 3q + 2 = -2q + 3, so q = 1/5
- Mixed Nash: both play A0 with probability 1/5
- Expected payoff: 5×(1/25) + 2×(4/25) + 1×(4/25) + 3×(16/25) = 65/25 = 2.6 points

## Step 5: Decision

While the best pure outcome (A0, A0) remains at 5 points with or without the contract, the contract makes coordination harder because:
1. It makes the mixed strategy equilibrium worse (2.6 vs 3 points)
2. It reduces the penalty for playing A1 when the other plays A0 (1 vs 3), making A1 relatively more attractive and potentially making coordination on (A0, A0) more difficult

The contract offers no upside but introduces downside risk.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the game's reward structure with the added payment contract.

### 1. Identify the Base Payoffs
The original payoffs without the contract are:
*   (P1: A0, P2: A0): 5, 5
*   (P1: A0, P2: A1): 0, 3 (P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1)
*   (P1: A1, P2: A0): 3, 0 (P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0)
*   (P1: A1, P2: A1): 3, 3

### 2. Apply the Contract
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other players." In a two-player game, this is a transfer of 1 point from the player choosing A1 (or A0) to the player choosing A0.

*   **(A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives 1 point and each pays 1 point. Net change = 0.
    Final points: **(5, 5)**
*   **(A0, A1):** P1 chooses A0 (receives 1), P2 chooses A1 (pays 1).
    Final points: P1 = 0 + 1 = 1, P2 = 3 - 1 = 2. **(1, 2)**
*   **(A1, A0):** P1 chooses A1 (pays 1), P2 chooses A0 (receives 1).
    Final points: P1 = 3 - 1 = 2, P2 = 0 + 1 = 1. **(2, 1)**
*   **(A1, A1):** Neither chooses A0. Net change = 0.
    Final points: **(3, 3)**

### 3. Analyze the Payoff Matrix
The final payoff matrix (P1, P2) is:
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (1, 2) |
| **P1: A1** | (2, 1) | (3, 3) |

*   **Nash Equilibria:** We check for stability.
    - If P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 (5 > 2).
    - If P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A0 (5 > 2).
    - If P1 plays A1, P2 prefers A1 (3 > 1).
    - If P2 plays A1, P1 prefers A1 (3 > 1).
    There are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria: **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)**.

### 4. Choose the Strategy
*   **Payoff Dominance:** (A0, A0) yields 5 points each, while (A1, A1) yields only 3. (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant.
*   **Risk Dominance:** We compare the products of the losses from deviation.
    - Deviation from (A0, A0): (5-2) * (5-2) = 9.
    - Deviation from (A1, A1): (3-1) * (3-1) = 4.
    Since 9 > 4, (A0, A0) is also the risk-dominant equilibrium.
*   **Forward Induction:** As Player 2, you proposed this contract specifically to make A0 more attractive and coordination more likely. This serves as a strong signal to Player 1 that you intend to play A0.

Given that (A0, A0) is both the most profitable and the most theoretically stable outcome, choosing A0 is the rational decision.

response:
To maximize my total points in this decision-making game, let's carefully evaluate the potential payoffs and consider the behavior of the other player (Player 2).

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Payoff Matrix
First, let’s revisit the payoff matrix without any contract modifications:

|             | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)      | (0, 3)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)      | (3, 3)      |

Where:
- (x, y) means Player 1 gets x points, and Player 2 gets y points.

#### Analysis of Payoffs:
1. If both choose **A0 (5, 5)**:
   - Both get 5 points, which is optimal in a cooperative mindset.
   
2. If Player 1 chooses **A0 and Player 2 chooses A1 (0, 3)**:
   - Player 1 gets 0 points, and Player 2 gets 3 points. 
   
3. If Player 1 chooses **A1 and Player 2 chooses A0 (3, 0)**:
   - Player 1 gets 3 points, and Player 2 gets 0 points.
   
4. If both choose **A1 (3, 3)**:
   - Both get 3 points, which is beneficial but less optimal than (5, 5).

#### Strategic Considerations
- If Player 2 were rational and cooperative, they might see the benefit of both choosing **A0** for maximizing joint points (10 points total).
- However, since Player 2 rejected the contract favoring **A0**, it suggests they might be inclined to choose **A1** more frequently to avoid scenarios where they get fewer points in comparison or to balance their outcomes.
  
#### Probabilistic Strategy
Given the uncertainty about Player 2's exact strategy and their rejection of the contract favoring **A0**, a mixed strategy can be considered. This is because:
- Playing **A0** gives higher rewards but is risky if Player 2 plays **A1**.
- Playing **A1** assures a safe but moderate outcome.

### Final Decision
To find a balanced strategy, I will choose a mix of **A0** and **A1** with some bias towards **A1** to mitigate the risk based on Player 2’s potential non-cooperative behavior.

Let's distribute the probabilities in a way that reflects these considerations. A reasonable approach might being somewhat equally probable but using a slight favoring towards **A1** due to rejection of the cooperative contract. 

Therefore, choosing **A0** with 40% and **A1** with 60% balances the risk and reward adequately.

# Step-by-step Analysis

## Step 1: Understand the payoffs WITHOUT the contract

Original game payoffs (Me, Other):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

Without the contract, this is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5 points (best outcome)
- **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3 points (safer but worse outcome)

The problem: A0 is risky because if the other player chooses A1, I get 0 points.

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- +5 points to any player choosing A0 (paid by the other player)
- 0 points for choosing A1

New payoffs (Me, Other):
- (A0, A0): (5+5-5, 5+5-5) = **(5, 5)**
- (A0, A1): (0+5, 3-5) = **(5, -2)**
- (A1, A0): (3-5, 0+5) = **(-2, 5)**
- (A1, A1): **(3, 3)**

## Step 3: Analyze my optimal strategy WITH the contract

If I choose A0: I get 5 points **regardless** of what the other player does
If I choose A1: I get 3 points (best case) or -2 points (if other plays A0)

**A0 is now a dominant strategy for me!** It always gives me 5 points.

## Step 4: Analyze the other player's optimal strategy

By symmetry, A0 is also a dominant strategy for the other player.

Result: With the contract, both players will choose A0, resulting in **(5, 5)**.

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

**Without contract:** 
- Risk of coordination failure → might end up at (A1, A1) with 3 points
- Best case: 5 points (requires successful coordination)

**With contract:**
- A0 becomes dominant strategy
- Guaranteed outcome: (A0, A0) with 5 points
- No coordination risk

## Step 6: Decision

The contract:
1. Eliminates the risk of the worse equilibrium (A1, A1)
2. Makes the optimal outcome (A0, A0) a guaranteed result
3. Ensures I get 5 points instead of risking only 3 points

**Conclusion:** Signing the contract is beneficial as it guarantees the best possible outcome.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoffs WITHOUT the contract

|          | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Me: A0   | 5, 5      | 0, 3      |
| Me: A1   | 3, 0      | 3, 3      |

## Step 2: Understand the payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds: +1 point to any player choosing A0 (paid by the other player)

|          | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Me: A0   | 5, 5      | 1, 2      |
| Me: A1   | 2, 1      | 3, 3      |

(When both choose A0, each gets +1 and pays -1, netting to original 5)

## Step 3: Analyze Nash equilibrium WITHOUT contract

If other player plays A0 with probability p:
- My payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- My payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

I'm indifferent when 5p = 3, so p = 0.6

At mixed Nash equilibrium (both play A0 with prob 0.6):
Expected payoff = 5(0.36) + 0(0.24) + 3(0.24) + 3(0.16) = **3 points**

## Step 4: Analyze Nash equilibrium WITH contract

If other player plays A0 with probability p:
- My payoff from A0: 5p + 1(1-p) = 4p + 1
- My payoff from A1: 2p + 3(1-p) = 3 - p

I'm indifferent when 4p + 1 = 3 - p, so 5p = 2, thus p = 0.4

At mixed Nash equilibrium (both play A0 with prob 0.4):
Expected payoff = 5(0.16) + 1(0.24) + 2(0.24) + 3(0.36) = **2.6 points**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- Without contract: Expected payoff = 3 points
- With contract: Expected payoff = 2.6 points

The contract makes me **worse off** in the mixed strategy equilibrium. Even considering pure strategy equilibria (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), the contract doesn't improve my payoffs - they stay at 5 and 3 respectively.

## Conclusion

Since signing the contract leads to equal or worse expected payoffs, I should NOT sign it.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

Base game payoffs for me (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 0  
- (A1, A0): 3
- (A1, A1): 3

This has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) = 5 points each (best outcome)
- (A1, A1) = 3 points each (safer but worse)

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (my proposal)

With Contract 1, the payoff matrix becomes:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 1 - 1 = **5** (I receive 1 for A0, pay 1 for opponent's A0)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 1 = **1** (I receive 1 for A0, opponent pays nothing)
- (A1, A0): 3 - 1 = **2** (I pay 1 for opponent's A0)
- (A1, A1): **3**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (Player 2's proposal)

With Contract 2, the payoff matrix becomes:
- (A0, A0): **5** (no payments)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 1 = **1** (opponent pays 1 for A1)
- (A1, A0): 3 - 1 = **2** (I pay 1 for A1)
- (A1, A1): 3 - 1 + 1 = **3** (both pay 1, both receive 1)

**Both contracts are mathematically equivalent!**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

The contracts change incentives:
- **Reduce risk**: Playing A0 when opponent plays A1 now gives 1 instead of 0 (less painful)
- **Reduce exploitation**: Playing A1 when opponent plays A0 now gives 2 instead of 3 (less tempting)
- **Pure Nash equilibria unchanged**: (A0, A0) still gives 5, (A1, A1) still gives 3

Key strategic insight: In the base game, I need to believe opponent will play A0 with >60% probability to justify playing A0. With either contract, I only need >40% belief. This makes coordination on the efficient (A0, A0) equilibrium **easier to achieve**.

## Step 5: Decision

Both contracts:
- Make the best outcome (A0, A0) more likely by lowering coordination threshold
- Are symmetric (fair to both players)
- Reduce downside risk
- Don't hurt the payoffs at the good equilibrium

**I approve both contracts.**

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoffs with the contract

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments

Let me compute the final payoffs for each outcome:

**When both choose A0:**
- Base: I get 5, other gets 5
- Contract: I get +4 (for my A0) - 4 (for their A0) = 0 net
- **Final: I get 5, other gets 5**

**When I choose A0, other chooses A1:**
- Base: I get 0, other gets 3
- Contract: I get +4 (for my A0), other pays -4
- **Final: I get 4, other gets -1**

**When I choose A1, other chooses A0:**
- Base: I get 3, other gets 0
- Contract: I pay -4, other gets +4
- **Final: I get -1, other gets 4**

**When both choose A1:**
- Base: I get 3, other gets 3
- Contract: No changes
- **Final: I get 3, other gets 3**

## Step 2: Analyze my payoff matrix

|           | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **My A0** | 5         | 4         |
| **My A1** | -1        | 3         |

## Step 3: Determine optimal strategy

Comparing my options:
- If other plays A0: My A0 gives 5 vs My A1 gives -1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: My A0 gives 4 vs My A1 gives 3 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1!** No matter what the other player does, I always get more points by choosing A0.

## Step 4: Verify the equilibrium

If both players analyze the game the same way, we both recognize A0 is dominant and both play A0, receiving 5 points each. This is also a Nash equilibrium - neither player wants to deviate.

## Conclusion

The contract has transformed the original game into one where A0 is the strictly dominant strategy. I should always choose A0.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

Let me analyze each contract's impact on the game equilibrium.

### Base Game Analysis

First, let me understand the payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):

**My payoffs (Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

The pure Nash equilibria are:
- (A0, A0) → both get 5 points (Pareto optimal)
- (A1, A1) → both get 3 points

### Contract 1 Analysis

With C1, playing A0 gives +1 point (taken from opponent):

**Modified payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): 5+1-1 = 5 for me, 5+1-1 = 5 for opponent
- (A0, A1): 0+1 = 1 for me, 3-1 = 2 for opponent
- (A1, A0): 3-1 = 2 for me, 0+1 = 1 for opponent
- (A1, A1): 3 for me, 3 for opponent

### Contract 2 Analysis

With C2, playing A1 costs -1 point (given to opponent):

**Modified payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): 5 for me, 5 for opponent
- (A0, A1): 0+1 = 1 for me, 3-1 = 2 for opponent
- (A1, A0): 3-1 = 2 for me, 0+1 = 1 for opponent
- (A1, A1): 3-1+1 = 3 for me, 3-1+1 = 3 for opponent

**Key Observation:** C1 and C2 are functionally equivalent!

### Risk Dominance Analysis

This is crucial for determining which equilibrium players will likely coordinate on.

**Base Game:**
- Loss from deviating at (A0, A0): 5-3 = 2 per player, product = 4
- Loss from deviating at (A1, A1): 3-0 = 3 per player, product = 9
- Since 4 < 9, **(A1, A1) is risk-dominant** - players likely coordinate on the worse outcome!

**Under C1 or C2:**
- Loss from deviating at (A0, A0): 5-2 = 3 per player, product = 9
- Loss from deviating at (A1, A1): 3-1 = 2 per player, product = 4
- Since 9 > 4, **(A0, A0) is risk-dominant** - players likely coordinate on the better outcome!

### Conclusion

Both contracts flip the risk dominance, making it much more likely that we'll achieve the Pareto-optimal outcome of (5, 5) instead of getting stuck at (3, 3). The contracts reduce the penalty for miscoordination, making A0 less risky to play.

Since both contracts are equivalent and both improve my expected outcome by making coordination on the best equilibrium more likely, I should approve both.

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Apply the contract

The contract states:
- Choosing A0 gives +5 points (paid by the other player)
- Choosing A1 has no additional payments

Since there are 2 players, when I choose A0, I receive +5 from Player 2. When Player 2 chooses A0, I pay -5 to them.

## Step 3: Calculate final payoffs with contract

**Case 1: I play A0, other plays A0**
- Base: 5 points
- I get +5 (for choosing A0)
- I pay -5 (other chose A0)
- **Total: 5 points**

**Case 2: I play A0, other plays A1**
- Base: 0 points
- I get +5 (for choosing A0)
- I pay 0 (other chose A1)
- **Total: 5 points**

**Case 3: I play A1, other plays A0**
- Base: 3 points
- I get 0 (I chose A1)
- I pay -5 (other chose A0)
- **Total: -2 points**

**Case 4: I play A1, other plays A1**
- Base: 3 points
- No contract payments
- **Total: 3 points**

## Step 4: Determine optimal strategy

Modified payoff matrix:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -2 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me 3 → **A0 is better**

**A0 is a strictly dominant strategy!** Regardless of what the other player does, I always get more points by choosing A0.

## Conclusion

I should play A0 with 100% probability to maximize my expected payoff.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

We are in a two-player simultaneous game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|                | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**     | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P2: A1**     | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

Note: In this setup, **you are Player 2**.

So the payoffs from **your** perspective (Player 2) are:

- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 3
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A1, A1): 3

This is a **coordination game with asymmetric payoffs**.

Let’s analyze the best responses.

If you play A0:
- If P1 plays A0 → you get 5
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 3
→ So A0 is better than A1 if P1 plays A1, but only if P1 plays A0 is A0 best.

If you play A1:
- If P1 plays A0 → you get 0
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 3
→ A1 is strictly better than A0 only if P1 plays A1.

So:
- If P1 plays A0, best response is A0 (5 > 0)
- If P1 plays A1, best response is A1 (3 > 0)

So no pure strategy Nash equilibrium stands out. But notice that (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are both Nash equilibria.

- At (A0, A0): neither player wants to deviate → each gets 5
- At (A1, A1): each gets 3, but if you deviate to A0 while other plays A1 → you get 0, so no incentive to deviate

So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium, but (A0, A0) is better for both.

But is there a *dominant strategy*?

Let’s check:
- Your payoff from A0 vs A1, depending on P1’s choice:

| P1's action | Your payoff if A0 | Your payoff if A1 |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| A0          | 5                 | 0                 |
| A1          | 3                 | 3                 |

So A0 is better when P1 plays A0, but equal when P1 plays A1.

A0 is **not** strictly dominant.

A1 is better only when P1 plays A1, but same when A0.

Now, what about mixed strategies?

Let’s find the symmetric Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.

Let p = probability that P1 plays A0.

Then your expected payoff:
- E(A0) = p×5 + (1−p)×3 = 5p + 3(1−p) = 5p + 3 − 3p = 2p + 3
- E(A1) = p×0 + (1−p)×3 = 3(1−p) = 3 − 3p

Set them equal for indifference:  
2p + 3 = 3 − 3p  
2p + 3p = 0 → 5p = 0 → p = 0

So only at p = 0 (P1 plays A1 with probability 1), you are indifferent.

But if p > 0, then E(A0) > E(A1)

So your best response:
- If P1 plays A0 with p > 0, E(A0) > E(A1) → always play A0
- Only when p = 0 (P1 always plays A1), indifferent

So no incentive to play A1 unless you believe P1 is playing A1.

But P1’s perspective: what are *their* incentives?

P1's payoff matrix:
- (A0,A0): 5
- (A0,A1): 3
- (A1,A0): 0
- (A1,A1): 3

So P1’s best responses:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent

So P1 will play A0 if they think you play A0, and may play A1 otherwise.

In a symmetric equilibrium, suppose both play mixed strategy with probability q of choosing A0.

Let’s find equilibrium.

Let q be P2's (your) probability of playing A0.

P1’s expected payoff:
- From choosing A0: q×5 + (1−q)×3 = 5q + 3 − 3q = 2q + 3
- From choosing A1: q×0 + (1−q)×3 = 3(1−q) = 3 − 3q

Set equal: 2q + 3 = 3 − 3q → 5q = 0 → q = 0

So for P1 to be indifferent, you must play A0 with q = 0 → always A1.

That means: only if you play A1 with probability 1, P1 is indifferent.

But then P1 plays A1 → your payoff if you play A1 is 3, if you play A0 is 0 → so you want to play A1.

But if you play A1 always, then P1 is getting 3 from A1, 3 from A0 → indifferent, so P1 might still play A0.

But if P1 plays A0, you get 0 if you play A0, so you’d want to switch to A1.

So (A1, A1) is a pure Nash equilibrium.

(A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But only (A0, A0) gives high payoff for both.

But (A0, A0) is fragile: if either player deviates, they lose.

Now, to maximize your *own* expected payoff in equilibrium, you’d hope for (A0, A0). But if the other player is rational and cautious, they might fear that you’ll play A1, so they might play A1 as a safe choice.

But let’s now bring in the **contract**.

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

> A contract was proposed by Player 1:  
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.  
> - If a player chooses A1, no payments.

So, **this is a transfer**:
- If you choose A0, you get +2 points, but the other player loses 2 points (since the payment is "drawn equally from the other players" — plural, but only one other player, so from you).
- The wording: “drawn equally from the other players” — there is only one other player, so it's a transfer of 2 points *from* the other player *to* you, if you choose A0.

But note: this is **not** a guaranteed transfer — only if you choose A0, you get +2, and the other player gets -2 (since they pay it).

So the **payoffs** are now modified.

We need to compute your **new payoffs** under the contract, assuming *you sign the contract and the other player signs it too* (since the contract only activates if all sign).

So the contract becomes active only if **both** sign.

You are evaluating whether to sign.

So we must evaluate the impact of the contract **on your expected payoff**, assuming the other player may or may not sign — but for the contract to be active, both must sign.

So **you are deciding** whether to sign, knowing that:
- The contract is active only if **both** players sign.
- The contract modifies payoffs as above.

So we need to compare:
- Your expected payoff **if you sign** and the contract is active (i.e., the other player signs too), vs
- Your expected payoff **if you do not sign** (regardless of the other player’s action).

But we can assume that the other player is rational and will also make a similar calculation.

So we must consider **whether both players will sign** — i.e., whether **both** have an incentive to sign.

But you get to decide whether to sign, so you must decide based on whether signing improves your expected payoff **in equilibrium**.

Let’s analyze the **new game with the contract**.

---

### **Step 3: Modified Payoffs With Contract Active**

Assume you and the other player both sign the contract.

Then, whenever a player chooses A0, they get +2 (from the other player), and the other player loses 2.

So the **new payoff matrix** is:

|                | P1: A0       | P1: A1      |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **P2: A0**     | (5+2, 5−2) = (7,3) | (0−2, 3+2) = (−2,5) |
| **P2: A1**     | (3+2, 0−2) = (5,−2) | (3,3)      |

Wait: Let's double-check:

- When you (P2) play A0 and P1 plays A0:  
  You get base 5 + 2 (for choosing A0) = 7  
  P1 gets base 5 − 2 (because you chose A0 → they pay you 2) = 3

- You A0, P1 A1:  
  You get 0 + 2 = 2? Wait — no!

Hold on: **The payment is received *if you choose A0*.**  
But when you choose A0 and P1 chooses A1:  
- You get base 0 (from game), plus you get +2 for choosing A0 → total 2  
- P1 gets base 3 (from game), but since you chose A0, they pay you 2 → so they lose 2 → 3 − 2 = 1

Wait, but in the contract, it says **"drawn equally from the other players"** — so if *you* choose A0, you get +2, and the **other player pays it**, so yes, other player loses 2.

So correct interpretation:

Whenever a player chooses A0, they get +2 (paid by the other player), regardless of what the other player does.

So the payoffs are:

|                | P1: A0         | P1: A1         |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P2: A0**     | (5 + 2, 5 − 2) = (7,3) | (0 + 2, 3 − 2) = (2,1) |
| **P2: A1**     | (3 − 2, 0 + 2) = (1,2) | (3,3)          |

Wait: when you (P2) choose A1 and P1 chooses A0:

- You get base 3, but did you choose A0? No, you chose A1 → so **no +2** → so you get 3 (base)  
- P1 chose A0 → so P1 gets +2 → but the cost is drawn from **other player**, i.e., you → so you lose 2 → so you get 3 − 2 = 1

Similarly:
- You A1, P1 A1: no one chose A0? You chose A1, P1 chose A1 → no +2 for anyone → so payoffs remain (3,3)

- You A0, P1 A1: you chose A0 → get +2 → so 0 + 2 = 2; P1 chose A1 → so P1 does not get +2, but you (P2) chose A0 → so P1 pays 2 → so P1 gets 3 − 2 = 1

Yes.

So corrected payoff matrix with contract active:

|                | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**     | (7,3)  | (2,1)  |
| **P2: A1**     | (1,2)  | (3,3)  |

Now, you are Player 2.

So your payoffs:

- A0 vs A0: 7
- A0 vs A1: 2
- A1 vs A0: 1
- A1 vs A1: 3

Now, analyze best responses.

If P1 plays A0:
- You get 7 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0

If P1 plays A1:
- You get 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So your best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → A0
- If P1 plays A1 → A1

Now P1's perspective:

- If you (P2) play A0:
  - P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If you play A1:
  - P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So P1's best response:
- If you play A0 → A0
- If you play A1 → A1

So the best responses are fully aligned: both players should play the same action.

So the game has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 7 and 3
- (A1, A1): both get 3 and 3

Now, which one is better?

(A0, A0): you get 7 → much better than base game (5)

But (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium — neither player wants to deviate.

If you deviate to A1 while P1 plays A0, you go from 7 to 1 → bad
P1 deviates from A0 to A1 while you play A0: P1 goes from 3 to 2 → also bad

So (A0, A0) is a stable equilibrium.

And since both players want to coordinate on A0 (because it gives the highest payoff), and it's a Nash equilibrium, we can expect it to be the focal point.

In fact, (A1, A1) is worse for both.

So **in the contract game**, rational players should coordinate on (A0, A0).

Thus, if the contract is active, expected payoff for you is **7**, assuming coordination on (A0, A0).

But what if coordination fails?

Suppose miscoordination — P1 plays A0, you play A1 → you get 1

But since both players have symmetric best responses and (A0, A0) gives highest payoff, **rationality suggests they will coordinate on (A0, A0)**.

So expected payoff if you sign and contract active: **7**

---

### **Step 4: What if You Do NOT Sign the Contract?**

Then, the contract does **not** become active — because it requires all players to sign.

So you are back to the **base game**.

In the base game, as we saw earlier, there are two equilibria:
- (A0, A0): you get 5
- (A1, A1): you get 3

But now, the other player (P1) is also rational.

Let’s check **P1’s incentive to sign**.

P1 is proposing the contract, so they likely believe they will benefit.

Let’s analyze P1’s expected payoff **if the contract is active**.

From the matrix above:
- If P1 plays A0 and you play A0: P1 gets 3
- If P1 plays A0 and you play A1: P1 gets 2
- If P1 plays A1 and you play A0: P1 gets 1
- If P1 plays A1 and you play A1: P1 gets 3

So P1’s payoffs:
- If you play A0: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If you play A1: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So P1’s best responses align with yours.

In equilibrium, both play A0 → P1 gets 3.

But in the **base game**, P1's payoffs:
- A0 vs A0: 5
- A0 vs A1: 3
- A1 vs A0: 0
- A1 vs A1: 3

So P1's best response:
- If you play A0: prefers A0 (5 > 0)
- If you play A1: prefers A1 (3 > 3? no, same) — indifferent

So P1 also has incentive to play A0 when you play A0.

Now, compare P1's payoff:

- If contract is active: P1 gets 3 in (A0, A0) equilibrium
- If contract is not active: P1 gets 5 in (A0, A0) equilibrium

So **P1 is worse off** if the contract is active — they get only 3 instead of 5.

Therefore, **P1 has no incentive to sign the contract**, unless they believe it will lead to coordination and avoid the risk of (A1, A1).

But in the base game, both players can coordinate on (A0, A0).

Is there any reason P1 would want to sign?

Let’s see: under the contract, P1’s payoff in (A0, A0) is **3**, down from 5.

So even though the contract makes everyone choose A0, P1 is **worse off** — they get 3 instead of 5.

So P1 **will not want to sign** the contract.

But you are deciding.

You are considering: should *you* sign?

But the contract requires **both** to sign to be active.

So even if you sign, **the contract doesn’t activate unless P1 signs**.

But if P1 does not sign (as likely), then the contract is **not active**, regardless of your choice.

So what is your expected payoff?

- **If you do not sign**: contract not active → you play base game → you can expect (A0, A0) → you get **5**
- **If you sign**: but P1 does not sign (since P1 is worse off), then contract is not active → base game → you still get **5**

But: **what if you sign, and P1 also signs?**

Then contract is active → expected payoff for you: **7**

But **P1 will not sign**, because they get only 3 instead of 5.

So **P1 will not sign**.

Therefore, **if you sign, the contract does not activate** — so your payoff is still 5.

But you paid nothing (no cost to sign), but you don’t get any benefit.

So **signing has no impact** — but it doesn’t hurt.

But here’s the catch: what if **you sign** and **P1 also signs**?

Then you get 7 — better than 5.

But P1 gets only 3 instead of 5 — so P1 has no incentive.

But perhaps P1, if they believe you will sign, might be induced to sign?

But no — P1 is rational.

Suppose P1 thinks you will sign.

Then, if P1 signs:
- They get: if you play A0, they get 3 (from contract game) → but wait, both signing → contract active → P1’s payoff depends on actions.

But in the contract game, if both sign, and both play A0 → P1 gets 3.

But if P1 does **not** sign, then contract inactive → base game → if you play A0, P1 can play A0 and get 5.

So P1 gets 5 if they don’t sign and both play A0, but only 3 if they sign and both play A0.

So P1 strictly prefers **not to sign**.

Thus, **P1 will not sign**.

Therefore, **the contract will not become active**, regardless of your choice.

Hence:
- If you sign: contract inactive → you get base game payoff → expect 5 (if coordination on A0)
- If you do not sign: same → you get 5

So signing has **no effect**.

But: is there a scenario where signing could help?

Only if P1 is willing to sign.

But P1 is worse off under the contract, so they won’t.

Moreover, the contract is designed to induce more A0 play by offering a reward, but it makes the proposer (P1) worse off.

So the contract is a **bad deal for P1**.

Therefore, P1 will not sign.

Thus, **the contract will not be active**, no matter what you do.

So **you receive 5 regardless of your choice**.

But wait — what if you sign, and P1 still signs? Then you get 7.

But P1 has no incentive.

But perhaps there is a **credible commitment**?

No — you’re just deciding whether to sign. The other player acts independently.

Since P1’s payoff is reduced under the contract, they will not sign.

So **the contract will not activate**.

Therefore, **your payoff is the same whether you sign or not** — 5.

So why sign?

But there is **no cost** to signing — so signing doesn't hurt.

But the question is: should you sign?

The only reason to sign is if it increases your expected payoff.

But in this case, it has **no effect** — you still get 5.

So **you are indifferent**.

But the question asks: do you sign?

But we must choose.

Let’s think: under what circumstances would the contract activate?

Only if **both** sign.

We have argued that P1 will not sign — because they get less payoff.

But what if P1 is not fully rational? No — we assume rationality.

Or what if you can **credibly commit**, but the contract is just a yes/no choice.

No, P1 will reject.

So contract is not active.

Thus, **no gain from signing**.

But is there a risk?

No — no risk.

So you can sign without losing anything.

But the question is: **do you sign**?

In game theory, if the action has no cost and no benefit, but doesn’t hurt, one might sign.

But here, the contract requires you to **commit** to the system.

But since it doesn’t activate, it’s harmless.

But the question is: should you sign to **maximize your expected points**?

Since signing gives no benefit and no cost, and **the other player will not sign**, then you get 5 either way.

So **indifferent**.

But now — consider this: **if you sign the contract, and P1 also signs, you get 7**.

But P1 gets only 3 → so P1 will not sign.

Unless P1 is misled.

But we assume rationality.

Another idea: perhaps the contract changes P1’s incentives in a way that makes them want to coordinate on A0?

But in the base game, (A0, A0) already gives P1 5, which is higher than any other outcome.

And under the contract, (A0, A0) only gives P1 3.

So no.

Therefore, **P1 will not sign**.

Hence, the contract will **not** be active.

Therefore, signing **does not change** your payoff.

So **you are indifferent**.

But since the question forces a yes/no, and there is no downside, **signing is harmless**.

But is there any **reason** to prefer signing?

Not really.

But what if the contract were signed by you, and P1 signs, but somehow you both play A0 → you get 7.

But P1 would never agree.

Another angle: what if **you sign**, and **P1 thinks you will cooperate**, but if P1 plays A0, and you play A0, then you get +2 for you, but P1 is worse off.

No.

Perhaps P1, if they think you will play A0, might be willing to play A0 in the contract game?

But no — if P1 plays A0 and you play A0 under contract, P1 gets 3.

But if contract is off, P1 gets 5.

So still worse.

So P1 will **not sign**.

Conclusion: **the contract will not be activated**.

Therefore, your expected payoff is **5** regardless.

So **signing has no benefit**.

But is there any cost to signing? No.

So signing is **dominated** only if it causes harm — but it doesn’t.

So **no harm** in signing.

But since there’s no benefit, and you care about maximizing points, **you should sign only if it increases your expected payoff**.

But it does not.

So **you should not sign**.

Wait — but what if signing signals commitment, and P1, seeing you sign, thinks you will play A0, and thus P1 is induced to play A0?

But P1 still gets 5 in base game if they play A0 while you play A0.

If they sign and play A0, they get 3, which is worse.

So they have **no incentive** to sign.

Thus, even if they think you will play A0, they still prefer not to sign.

So **P1 will not sign**.

Hence, **you cannot benefit**.

Therefore, **there is no reason to sign**.

So **you should not sign**.

But let’s double-check: **is there a pure strategy in the contract game that is better for you?**

Yes — (A0, A0) gives 7.

But P1 won’t agree to that.

So no.

Final reasoning:

- You sign: contract inactive → you get 5
- You do not sign: contract inactive → you get 5
- But P1 will not sign → contract inactive regardless
- So your payoff is 5 in either case
- Since signing has no impact, and you want to maximize points, you might as well **not sign**, since it doesn't help.

But is there a **dominant strategy**?

In the contract game, if it were active, you would always want to play A0.

But it’s not.

No.

Therefore, **you should not sign**, because it does not improve your outcome, and you get no benefit.

Even though it doesn’t hurt, since the goal is to **maximize points**, and both choices give the same expected points (5), you can **choose either**.

But the question is: should you sign?

In decision theory, if two actions give same expected payoff, you are indifferent.

But the output requires a choice.

But let’s look again: what if the contract **could** be activated?

Only if P1 signs.

But P1 will not, because they get less payoff.

So **the contract will not be active**.

Therefore, **your payoff is 5 whether you sign or not**.

So **you are indifferent**.

But to pick one, we must see if there's a **dominant reason**.

But here’s a twist: **you are Player 2**.

Suppose you sign, and P1 knows you signed.

Then P1 can reason: if I play A0, and you play A0, I get 3 (under contract), but if contract is not active, I get 5.

So still better to not sign.

So no.

Final conclusion:

**The contract will not be activated, so signing has no effect. Since there is no benefit, and you are trying to maximize points, there is no reason to sign.**

But since it doesn't hurt, and perhaps it’s a formality, but the question is about maximizing points.

And since signing does not increase your points, **you should not sign**.

But wait — what if signing increases your chance of coordination?

For example, if you sign, it signals willingness to play A0, and P1, seeing that, might play A0?

But P1 still gets 5 in base game if you play A0.

But if you sign and P1 doesn’t, then contract inactive, P1 still gets 5 if they play A0.

But if P1 thinks you will play A0 (because you signed), they might play A0.

But if P1 plays A0, you play A0 → you get 5.

But if contract were active, you would get 7, but it’s not.

So no.

But in base game, if you sign, and P1 sees it, they might still play A0, so you get 5.

But without signing, same thing.

So **no change**.

Therefore, **signing has no effect**.

So in the end, **you should not sign**, because it provides no benefit, and we aim to maximize points — you get 5 either way.

But to be precise: if you sign, you might be seen as more cooperative, but that doesn’t help.

Thus, the best decision is **not to sign**.

Wait — but let’s consider this: what if signing the contract makes the other player more likely to sign?

But no — P1 is rational, and knows that if they sign, they get less.

So they won’t.

So no.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P1
response:
First, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix:**
   The Payoff Matrix without the contract influence can be summarized as follows:

   - If both players choose A0: Both get 5 points.
   - If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: I get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
   - If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: I get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
   - If both players choose A1: Both get 3 points.

2. **Strategy Analysis:**
   If we analyze the payoffs:
   - Choosing A0 can yield a high payoff of 5 points, but this occurs only if the other player also chooses A0.
   - Choosing A1 guarantees me 3 points regardless of the other player's choice (either 3 points if A1 is chosen by both, or 3 points if the other player chooses A0).

3. **Impact of the Contract Rejection:**
   The contract would have introduced additional points for choosing A0, making it more appealing. However, since Player 2 rejected it, we are playing with the original payoffs only.

4. **Game Theory Insight (Nash Equilibrium):**
   - If both players aimed to maximize their individual payoff without cooperating, the Nash Equilibrium needs to be considered.
   - Choosing A1 when suspecting rational decision-making by the other player may seem stable because it avoids the risk of getting 0 points through A0.

5. **Optimal Play in a Single-Round Game:**
   - Given the payoff structure, A1 seems inherently safer since it provides consistent returns regardless of the opponent’s choice.

6. **Mixed Strategy Consideration:**
   We could consider choosing a probability distribution that isn't deterministic to attempt cooperation or throw off the other player but deterministic choices here seem more rational.

Therefore, rational thinking in this setup might lean towards consistently choosing A1, given that it avoids the scenario of getting 0 points.

### Decision:

Choosing A1 solely seems mathematically safer from a single-round perspective. This is because it guarantees I receive at least 3 points which are higher than the 0 points risk from choosing A0.

Let's put this into the required format:

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 100}
```

This setup prioritizes a certain payoff over risking a larger one per the analyzed strategy.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs (my perspective)

| My Action | Other's Action | My Payoff | Other's Payoff |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| A0 | A0 | 5 | 5 |
| A0 | A1 | 0 | 3 |
| A1 | A0 | 3 | 0 |
| A1 | A1 | 3 | 3 |

## Step 2: Calculate modified payoffs with contract

The contract adds:
- +1 point for choosing A0 (taken from opponent)
- -2 points for choosing A1 (given to opponent)

Modified payoffs:

| My Action | Other's Action | My Payoff | Other's Payoff |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| A0 | A0 | 5+1-1 = **5** | 5+1-1 = 5 |
| A0 | A1 | 0+1+2 = **3** | 3-1-2 = 0 |
| A1 | A0 | 3-2-1 = **0** | 0+1+2 = 3 |
| A1 | A1 | 3-2+2 = **3** | 3+2-2 = 3 |

## Step 3: Analyze the original game

In the original game:
- Both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash equilibria
- There's also a mixed strategy equilibrium at probability 0.6 for A0
- At the mixed equilibrium, my expected payoff = 3
- The coordination problem: (A0, A0) gives payoff 5, but (A1, A1) is also stable at payoff 3

## Step 4: Analyze the modified game with contract

With the contract:
- If other plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs 0 from A1 → **A0 strictly better**
- If other plays A1: I get 3 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **Indifferent**
- A0 weakly dominates A1

The same logic applies to the other player (symmetric game).

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

**Without contract:** 
- Mixed strategy equilibrium gives expected payoff = 3
- Risk of coordinating on (A1, A1) giving payoff = 3

**With contract:**
- A0 is weakly dominant for both players
- (A0, A0) becomes the clear focal equilibrium
- Guaranteed payoff = 5

## Conclusion

The contract eliminates the coordination problem and essentially guarantees the best mutual outcome (5, 5) instead of risking an expected payoff of 3. I should sign.

response:
Let's break this decision-making game down step by step, considering all the aspects, including the contract.

### 1. Understanding Payoffs Without Contract:
First, we understand the basic payoffs matrix without considering the contract:
- If both play A0: (5, 5)
- If both play A1: (3, 3)
- If Player 1 (P1) plays A0 and Player 2 (P2) plays A1: (0, 3)
- If P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0: (3, 0)

### 2. Impact of the Contract:
Next, we add the contract's effect to each outcome:
- If Player chooses A0: Gain an additional 1 point.
- If Player chooses A1: Lose 2 points.

Revised Payoffs with the Contract:
- Both play A0: (5+1, 5+1) = (6, 6)
- Both play A1: (3-2, 3-2) = (1, 1)
- P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1: (0+1, 3-2) = (1, 1)
- P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0: (3-2, 0+1) = (1, 1)

### 3. Analyzing Outcomes:
Due to the contract, each updated payoff:
- Both playing A0 is now highly beneficial: 6 points each.
- Both playing A1 is less beneficial: 1 point each.
- Mixed strategies where one plays A0 and the other plays A1 results in both getting 1 point.

### 4. Strategy Implications:
Given the above transformations, it becomes apparent that choosing A0, because of the contract, provides a significant advantage over choosing A1.

### 5. Optimal Strategy Mixed Calculation:
In a Nash equilibrium, players will choose strategies that maximize their expected utilities. However, the clear dominance of A0 over A1 due to the contract simplifies the situation.

### 6. Final Decision:
From the above analysis, it’s evident that the optimal strategy is for both players to choose A0 with high probability due to the revised payoffs. 

**Final Answer (JSON object):**
```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

Explanation:
- With a pay structure that strongly rewards A0 and penalizes A1, the rational strategy for maximizing points is to play A0 exclusively. Thus, we assign 100% probability to A0 and 0% to A1.

response:
To approach this game optimally, we need to consider both the basic payoff structure and the additional payments specified by the contract. Let's analyze the possible scenarios with all relevant points included.

### Basic Payoff Analysis:
- If both you and the other player choose A0:
  - Base points: You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
  - Contract points: You get 2 additional points (total 7), the other player gets 2 additional points (total 7).
  
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - Base points: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
  - Contract points: You get 2 additional points (total 2), the other player receives your 2 points and gets no additional points (total 3).
  
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - Base points: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
  - Contract points: You get no additional points (total 3), the other player receives your 2 points and gets 2 additional points (total 2).
  
- If both you and the other player choose A1:
  - Base points: You get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.
  - Contract points: No additional changes (total 3 each).

### Expected Payoff Calculation:
Given this payoff structure, let's calculate the expected payoff under various mixed strategy scenarios, taking into account the contract adjustments.

#### Let's denote:
- \( p \): Probability that you choose A0.
- \( q \): Probability that the other player chooses A0.

The mixed strategy must balance expected payoffs based on the probability of each combination occurring.

### Expected Payoff for You (Player 1):
Using the probabilities above, we can calculate:

1. **You choose A0 (with probability \( p \))**:
   - The expected payoff if the other player chooses A0 (with probability \( q \)): \[ 7q \]
   - The expected payoff if the other player chooses A1 (with probability \( 1 - q \)): \[ 2 (1 - q) \]

    Total expected payoff for \( A0 \):
    \[
    7q + 2 (1 - q) = 7q + 2 - 2q = 5q + 2
    \]

2. **You choose A1 (with probability \( 1 - p \))**:
   - The expected payoff if the other player chooses A0 (with probability \( q \)): \[ 3q \]
   - The expected payoff if the other player chooses A1 (with probability \( 1 - q \)): \[ 3(1 - q) \]

    Total expected payoff for \( A1 \):
    \[
    3q + 3 (1 - q) = 3q + 3 - 3q = 3
    \]

Combine these two possible payoffs:
\[ p (5q + 2) + (1 - p)(3) \]

### Best Pure Strategy Evaluation:
Evaluate the net payoff for pure strategies assuming each player's action determination primarily:

1. **Choose A0 with 100% probability** (pure strategy):
   \[
   5q + 2
   \]
   Assuming the other player uses similar calculation, the best pure strategy:
   
   - If the other player also chooses A0: You both gain 7 points.
   - If the other player chooses A1: You gain 2 points, and they get 3 points.
   
2. **Choose A1 with 100% probability** (pure strategy):
   \[
   3
   \]
   - Involves no extra points, straightforward 3 points each if mutual choice.

Given this scenario, if we assume rational play by the opponent:

### Conclusion:
**Optimal Strategy**: Both players selecting A0 yields the highest points (7 each).

Thus, I'd suggest a pure strategy (A0) for maximum benefit:

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

response:
To maximize points in this coordination game, we first analyze the payoff matrix for Player 2 (you) and Player 1:

*   **(A0, A0):** (5, 5) — Both players receive 5 points.
*   **(A0, A1):** (0, 3) — Player 2 (you) receives 0, Player 1 receives 3.
*   **(A1, A0):** (3, 0) — Player 2 receives 3, Player 1 receives 0.
*   **(A1, A1):** (3, 3) — Both players receive 3 points.

### Strategic Analysis:
1.  **Nash Equilibria:** This game has two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) is Pareto-superior (yielding more points for both), it is also riskier. 
2.  **Risk Assessment:** 
    *   If you choose **A1**, you are guaranteed 3 points regardless of what Player 1 chooses.
    *   If you choose **A0**, your payoff depends entirely on Player 1. If Player 1 chooses A0, you get 5. If they choose A1, you get 0.
3.  **The Twist (Contract Analysis):** Player 1 proposed a contract that would have given a 1-point bonus for choosing A0 (deducted from the other player). Under that contract, a player choosing A0 would receive 1 point if the other played A1, avoiding the 0-point outcome. 
4.  **The Signal:** Player 1 rejected their own proposed contract. If Player 1 intended to play A0, they would have benefited from (or been indifferent to) the contract. By rejecting it, Player 1 avoided a potential penalty: if the contract were active and they played A1 while you played A0, they would have lost 1 point (getting 2 instead of 3). 

### Conclusion:
Player 1's rejection of a contract that protects A0 players and penalizes A1 players is a strong signal that they intend to play A1, the "safe" strategy. Since Player 1 is likely to play A1, choosing A0 would result in 0 points for you, whereas choosing A1 guarantees you 3 points. Therefore, the safest and most rational response given the signals is to play A1.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 100}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix (from my perspective as Player 2)

|  | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **I play A0** | I get 5 | I get 0 |
| **I play A1** | I get 3 | I get 3 |

## Step 2: Identify Nash Equilibria

Let me check for pure strategy equilibria:

- **(A0, A0)**: If other plays A0, I get 5 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → I stay with A0. If I play A0, other gets 5 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → they stay with A0. ✓ **Nash equilibrium** (5,5)

- **(A1, A1)**: If other plays A1, I get 3 from A1 vs 0 from A0 → I stay with A1. If I play A1, other gets 3 from A1 vs 0 from A0 → they stay with A1. ✓ **Nash equilibrium** (3,3)

This is a **coordination game** with two pure Nash equilibria.

## Step 3: Calculate Mixed Strategy Equilibrium

For me to be indifferent between A0 and A1, let p = probability other plays A0:
- Expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- Expected payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Setting equal: 5p = 3 → **p = 0.6**

By symmetry, the mixed Nash equilibrium is both players playing **A0 with 60% probability, A1 with 40% probability**.

## Step 4: Strategic Considerations

- (A0, A0) is **Pareto dominant** - best for both players
- (A1, A1) is **risk dominant** - A1 guarantees me 3 points regardless of what the other player does
- Player 1 proposed a contract to encourage A0, suggesting they prefer coordination on (A0, A0)
- However, I rejected the contract, which might create uncertainty

## Step 5: Decision

Given the uncertainty about Player 1's expectations after my contract rejection, the mixed strategy equilibrium (60% A0, 40% A1) is a rational choice that:
- Guarantees expected payoff of 3
- Maintains flexibility
- Represents a stable game-theoretic solution for this coordination problem

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the Base Game

The base game payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3) 
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This has two pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) - the best outcome with 5 points each
- (A1, A1) - a worse outcome with 3 points each

The challenge is coordinating on the better (A0, A0) equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With +1 payment for choosing A0:
- (A0, A0): 5+1-1 = 5, 5+1-1 = 5 → (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): 0+1 = 1, 3-1 = 2 → (1, 2)
- (A1, A0): 3-1 = 2, 0+1 = 1 → (2, 1)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

If the other player chooses A0 with probability p:
- My payoff from A0: 5p + 1(1-p) = 4p + 1
- My payoff from A1: 2p + 3(1-p) = 3 - p

I prefer A0 when: 4p + 1 > 3 - p → p > 0.4

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

With +2 payment for choosing A0:
- (A0, A0): 5+2-2 = 5, 5+2-2 = 5 → (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): 0+2 = 2, 3-2 = 1 → (2, 1)
- (A1, A0): 3-2 = 1, 0+2 = 2 → (1, 2)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

I prefer A0 when: 3p + 2 > 3 - 2p → p > 0.2

## Step 4: Compare Outcomes

Key insight: The pure strategy equilibria remain the same across all scenarios:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) - unchanged
- (A1, A1): (3, 3) - unchanged

However, the threshold for preferring A0 changes:
- **No contract**: Need p > 0.6 (other player must be 60% likely to play A0)
- **C1**: Need p > 0.4 (only 40% likelihood needed)
- **C2**: Need p > 0.2 (only 20% likelihood needed)

## Step 5: Decision

Both contracts make it easier to coordinate on the optimal (A0, A0) equilibrium by:
1. Reducing the risk of playing A0 when the other player might choose A1
2. Lowering the threshold belief needed to justify playing A0
3. Making (A0, A0) more "risk-dominant"

Since both contracts facilitate reaching the best outcome (5 points) without changing the payoffs at that outcome, both are beneficial. C2 provides even stronger coordination incentives than C1.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

From my perspective (Player 1):
- A0 vs A0: I get 5
- A0 vs A1: I get 0  
- A1 vs A0: I get 3
- A1 vs A1: I get 3

## Step 2: Identify Nash Equilibria

This is a coordination game with three Nash equilibria:

1. **Pure strategy: (A0, A0)** - Payoffs: (5, 5) - Pareto optimal
2. **Pure strategy: (A1, A1)** - Payoffs: (3, 3) - Risk dominant  
3. **Mixed strategy**: Both players play A0 with probability 0.6

## Step 3: Calculate Best Responses

If the other player plays A0 with probability p:
- My expected payoff from A0: **5p**
- My expected payoff from A1: **3**

I should prefer A0 when 5p > 3, which means **p > 0.6**

## Step 4: Consider the Context

Key observations:
- I proposed a contract encouraging A0 but then **rejected it**
- The other player **approved** the contract
- This creates uncertainty about mutual trust

The rejection might signal to the other player that I'm not committed to cooperation, potentially pushing them toward the safer A1 strategy.

## Step 5: Optimal Strategy

Given the uncertainty and conflicting signals:
- Playing pure A0 risks getting 0 if the other player plays defensively
- Playing pure A1 is safe but foregoes potential gains
- The **mixed strategy equilibrium** (60% A0, 40% A1) guarantees an expected payoff of 3 regardless of opponent's strategy

This mixed strategy is robust and represents the equilibrium where both players are indifferent and neither has incentive to deviate.

response:
Let's analyze this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Payoffs (Without Contract)**

We are in a simultaneous move game between two players. You are **Player 2**, and you must choose a probability distribution over actions A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (where row = your action, column = opponent's action) is:

|         | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **You A0** | 5, 5        | 0, 3        |
| **You A1** | 3, 0        | 3, 3        |

- If both choose A0: (5, 5)
- If you choose A0, opponent A1: (0, 3)
- If you choose A1, opponent A0: (3, 0)
- If both choose A1: (3, 3)

---

### **Step 2: Identify the Nash Equilibrium (Best Response)**

This is a classic coordination and incentive game.

Let’s find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that **Player 1** chooses A0
- $ q $ = probability that **Player 2** (you) chooses A0

You want to choose $ q $ to maximize your expected payoff, given that Player 1 plays $ p $, and you assume they will play optimally (i.e., they are also rational and will play their best response).

But since you are the one choosing your strategy, and assuming the other player will also play optimally, we look for a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium.

---

#### **Find Player 1’s Best Response to Your Strategy**

Let’s suppose **you (Player 2)** play A0 with probability $ q $, A1 with $ 1 - q $.

Then, **Player 1’s expected payoff** from choosing A0:
- With you playing A0 (prob $ q $): gets 5
- With you playing A1 (prob $ 1 - q $): gets 0
→ Expected payoff from A0: $ 5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q $

Expected payoff from choosing A1:
- You play A0 (prob $ q $): gets 3
- You play A1 (prob $ 1 - q $): gets 3
→ Expected payoff from A1: $ 3q + 3(1 - q) = 3 $

For Player 1 to be indifferent (which is needed for mixing), set:
$$
5q = 3 \Rightarrow q = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
$$

So, **Player 1 is willing to mix only if you play A0 with probability 0.6**.

---

#### **Now find your best response (as Player 2) to Player 1’s strategy**

Let’s suppose **Player 1** plays A0 with probability $ p $, A1 with $ 1 - p $.

Your expected payoff from choosing A0:
- Opponent plays A0 (prob $ p $): you get 5
- Opponent plays A1 (prob $ 1 - p $): you get 0
→ Expected: $ 5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p $

Your expected payoff from choosing A1:
- Opponent plays A0 (prob $ p $): you get 3
- Opponent plays A1 (prob $ 1 - p $): you get 3
→ Expected: $ 3p + 3(1 - p) = 3 $

You are indifferent when:
$$
5p = 3 \Rightarrow p = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
$$

So **you are willing to mix only if Player 1 plays A0 with probability 0.6**

---

#### **Conclusion: Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**

- Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ p = 0.6 $
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability $ q = 0.6 $

Because:
- If Player 1 plays 60% A0, you are indifferent between A0 and A1 → so you can play any mix, but only 60% A0 makes you indifferent.
- Similarly for Player 1.

So in **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**, both players play A0 with probability **0.6**, A1 with 0.4.

This is the rational, stable strategy under the assumption that both players are rational and will play optimally.

---

### **But: The Contract Was Proposed — But Rejected!**

Important detail: The **contract was proposed by Player 1** and **rejected by Player 2 (you)**. Therefore, **the contract is not in effect**.

So we **do not** apply the 2-point bonus for choosing A0.

Even though you rejected the contract, you are playing without it, and **the original payoffs apply**.

So your payoff matrix is unchanged.

---

### **Your Goal: Maximize Your Expected Points**

You must pick a probability distribution $ (q, 1 - q) $ over A0, A1, where $ q $ is your probability of choosing A0.

But since this is a game, and the other player is rational, you should assume they will also play rationally.

Given that, the only stable outcome is the **symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**, where both play A0 with probability 0.6.

If you deviate from this, and the opponent still plays 0.6, then:

- Your expected payoff from A0: $ 5p = 5 \times 0.6 = 3 $
- From A1: always 3 → so you are indifferent

So **any mix is equally good** if the opponent plays 0.6.

But what if you think the opponent might play something else?

Let’s suppose the opponent plays A0 with probability $ p $.

Your expected payoff from choosing A0: $ 5p $

From choosing A1: $ 3 $

So:
- If $ p > 0.6 $: A0 is better
- If $ p < 0.6 $: A1 is better
- If $ p = 0.6 $: indifferent

But in equilibrium, both play 0.6.

Since the only stable outcome is both playing 0.6, and you have no reason to believe the opponent will play differently (especially since they are rational), **you should play the equilibrium strategy**.

Thus, choosing **A0 with 60%**, **A1 with 40%** is optimal.

---

### **Final Decision**

You are to choose a probability distribution (as Player 2) over A0 and A1.

- A0: 60%
- A1: 40%

Sum is 100%, valid percentages.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

**Without contract:**
- (A0, A0): I get 5, P1 gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, P1 gets 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, P1 gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, P1 gets 3

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5 points each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 points each.

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs with the contract

With the contract, playing A1 costs 1 point (paid to the other player):

**With contract:**
- (A0, A0): I get 5, P1 gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0+1=1, P1 gets 3-1=2
- (A1, A0): I get 3-1=2, P1 gets 0+1=1
- (A1, A1): I get 3+1-1=3, P1 gets 3+1-1=3

## Step 3: Analyze the strategic impact

The key question: Does this contract help us coordinate on the better equilibrium (A0, A0)?

Let me check **risk dominance** - which equilibrium is safer to play:

**Without contract:**
- Risk of deviating from (A0, A0): losing 5-3=2 points
- Risk of deviating from (A1, A1): losing 3-0=3 points
- (A1, A1) is risk-dominant (2×2=4 < 3×3=9)

**With contract:**
- Risk of deviating from (A0, A0): losing 5-2=3 points  
- Risk of deviating from (A1, A1): losing 3-1=2 points
- (A0, A0) becomes risk-dominant (3×3=9 > 2×2=4)

## Step 4: Conclusion

The contract fundamentally changes the game! It:
- Makes A1 less attractive (by adding a cost)
- Makes (A0, A0) the risk-dominant equilibrium
- Helps coordinate on the efficient outcome (5,5) instead of the inferior one (3,3)
- Reduces losses from miscoordination (0→1 or 3→2)

Since the contract helps us coordinate on the better equilibrium where I get 5 points instead of 3, I should sign it.

response:
Let's break down the game and analyze each proposed contract step-by-step to determine the best strategy for maximizing your total points.

### Step 1: Understand the Basic Payoff Matrix
The basic payoff matrix for both players is as follows:
- (A0, A0): You get 5 points, Other gets 5 points.
- (A0, A1): You get 0 points, Other gets 3 points.
- (A1, A0): You get 3 points, Other gets 0 points.
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 points.

### Step 2: Evaluate Payoff with Contract Proposed by Player 1
Contract C1:
- A0 provides an additional 1 point, taken from the other player.
- A1 costs an additional 1 point, given to the other player.

Here is the new payoff table under Contract C1:
- (A0, A0): You get 6 points (5 + 1), Other gets 4 points (5 - 1).
- (A0, A1): You get -1 points (0 - 1), Other gets 4 points (3 + 1).
- (A1, A0): You get 4 points (3 + 1), Other gets -1 points (0 - 1).
- (A1, A1): Both get 2 points (3 - 1).

### Step 3: Evaluate Payoff with Contract Proposed by Player 2
Contract C2:
- A0 provides an additional 1 point, taken from the other player.
- A1 costs an additional 2 points, given to the other player.

Here is the new payoff table under Contract C2:
- (A0, A0): You get 6 points (5 + 1), Other gets 4 points (5 - 1).
- (A0, A1): You get -2 points (0 - 2), Other gets 5 points (3 + 2).
- (A1, A0): You get 5 points (3 + 2), Other gets -2 points (0 - 2).
- (A1, A1): Both get 1 points (3 - 2).

### Step 4: Analysis
#### Contract C1 Analysis:
- You stand to gain more points if both play A0 (6 points for you, 4 points for other).
- Playing A1 can result in some gains but the maximum points are attained in A0 vs A0. 
- Incentivizes cooperation in playing A0, but still provides relatively balanced outcomes with small penalties.

#### Contract C2 Analysis:
- Higher risk with larger penalties associated with A1.
- If both cooperate and play A0, the payoff is very similar to C1 (6-4 split).
- Defection (playing A1 while the other plays A0) is riskier but rewards individual more if opponent plays A0.

### Conclusion and Decision:
Given the risk-averse strategy and desire to optimize your gains without heavy penalties, Contract C1 is generally more balanced and favorable compared to C2. Therefore, the optimal approval would be for Contract C1 and disapprove Contract C2.

### Final Output:
```json
{
    "C1": true,
    "C2": false
}
```
This decision maximizes your total points while maintaining balanced, cooperative outcomes.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understanding the original game payoffs

Without contract (my payoffs):
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points  
- (A1, A0): 3 points
- (A1, A1): 3 points

## Step 2: Understanding how the contract modifies payoffs

The contract imposes a 1-point penalty on choosing A1, paid to the other player.

With contract (my payoffs):
- (A0, A0): 5 points (no change)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 1 = 1 point (I receive 1 from other's A1 penalty)
- (A1, A0): 3 - 1 = 2 points (I pay 1 penalty for my A1)
- (A1, A1): 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 points (I pay 1 but receive 1)

## Step 3: Analyzing the strategic impact

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5 points and (A1, A1) giving 3 points.

**Risk-dominance test** - What's my best response if the other player plays 50-50?

Without contract:
- Expected value of A0: 0.5(5) + 0.5(0) = 2.5
- Expected value of A1: 0.5(3) + 0.5(3) = 3.0
- → A1 is better (risk-dominant equilibrium is A1, A1)

With contract:
- Expected value of A0: 0.5(5) + 0.5(1) = 3.0
- Expected value of A1: 0.5(2) + 0.5(3) = 2.5
- → A0 is better (risk-dominant equilibrium is A0, A0)

## Step 4: Conclusion

The contract shifts the risk-dominant equilibrium from (A1, A1) to (A0, A0). This means:
- Makes coordination on the Pareto-optimal outcome (A0, A0) more likely
- Provides insurance if I cooperate but the other doesn't (1 vs 0 points)
- Reduces temptation to defect from mutual cooperation (2 vs 3 points)

The contract helps both players coordinate on the better outcome where we both get 5 points.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
To maximize the total points received in this game, we first analyze the original payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2 (you):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| A0 | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| A1 | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

In the original game, there are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding (5, 5) and (A1, A1) yielding (3, 3). However, (A1, A1) is risk-dominant. In it, both players receive a guaranteed payoff of 3 regardless of the other's choice, whereas choosing A0 introduces a risk of receiving 0. This typically leads players to coordinate on the safer (A1, A1) outcome.

Next, we evaluate the proposed contracts:

**Contract 1 (C1):**
- Bonus for A0: +1 for the player, -1 for the other player.
- Penalty for A1: -1 for the player, +1 for the other player.
Resulting Matrix:
- (A0, A0): P1: 5+1-1 = 5, P2: 5+1-1 = 5.
- (A0, A1): P1: 0+1+1 = 2, P2: 3-1-1 = 1.
- (A1, A0): P1: 3-1-1 = 1, P2: 0+1+1 = 2.
- (A1, A1): P1: 3-1+1 = 3, P2: 3-1+1 = 3.

**Contract 2 (C2):**
- Bonus for A0: +1 for the player, -1 for the other player.
- No penalty for A1.
Resulting Matrix:
- (A0, A0): P1: 5+1-1 = 5, P2: 5+1-1 = 5.
- (A0, A1): P1: 0+1 = 1, P2: 3-1 = 2.
- (A1, A0): P1: 3-1 = 2, P2: 0+1 = 1.
- (A1, A1): P1: 3, P2: 3.

**Comparison:**
- **Original:** Risk of playing A0 is high (reward can drop to 0). Risk product for (A1, A1) is higher (9 vs 4).
- **C1:** Risk of playing A0 is reduced (reward only drops to 2). Risk product for (A0, A0) is higher (16 vs 1).
- **C2:** Risk of playing A0 is reduced (reward only drops to 1). Risk product for (A0, A0) is higher (9 vs 4).

Both contracts C1 and C2 shift the risk-dominance to the (A0, A0) equilibrium, making it significantly more likely for both players to choose A0 and receive 5 points instead of 3. C1 provides a stronger incentive for A0 and offers more protection (a floor of 2 points when playing A0), while C2 (which you proposed) also achieves the goal of stabilizing the (5, 5) outcome.

Approving both contracts increases the probability that a coordination-improving contract is selected.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate Modified Payoffs with Contract

Let me first determine the actual payoffs after applying the contract:

**Case 1: I play A0, they play A0**
- Base: I get 5
- Contract: I choose A0 → receive +1 from them
- Contract: They choose A0 → I pay -1 to them
- **Net: 5 + 1 - 1 = 5**

**Case 2: I play A0, they play A1**
- Base: I get 0
- Contract: I choose A0 → receive +1 from them  
- Contract: They choose A1 → receive +2 from them (they pay me)
- **Net: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3**

**Case 3: I play A1, they play A0**
- Base: I get 3
- Contract: I choose A1 → pay -2 to them
- Contract: They choose A0 → pay -1 to them
- **Net: 3 - 2 - 1 = 0**

**Case 4: I play A1, they play A1**
- Base: I get 3
- Contract: I choose A1 → pay -2 to them
- Contract: They choose A1 → receive +2 from them
- **Net: 3 - 2 + 2 = 3**

## Step 2: Analyze the Modified Game

My payoff matrix:
```
              They play A0    They play A1
I play A0          5               3
I play A1          0               3
```

## Step 3: Find Best Response

**If they play A0:** I get 5 from A0 vs 0 from A1 → **A0 is strictly better**

**If they play A1:** I get 3 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **Indifferent**

## Step 4: Identify Nash Equilibria

- **(A0, A0)**: Gives payoff (5,5) - strict Nash equilibrium, neither wants to deviate
- **(A1, A1)**: Gives payoff (3,3) - weak Nash equilibrium

## Step 5: Choose Strategy

(A0, A0) is:
- **Pareto optimal**: Best possible outcome for both players
- **Payoff dominant**: Gives 5 vs 3
- **Risk dominant**: Higher product of deviation losses
- **Focal point**: The natural coordination point

Since A0 strictly dominates A1 when the opponent plays A0, and the (A0, A0) equilibrium is clearly superior, the rational strategy is to play A0 with certainty to coordinate on the best mutual outcome.

===== Response [ID: 8de0a685] [2026-01-21 23:41:36] =====
agent: openai/gpt-5.2(CoT)#P2
response:
To decide approvals, compare what each contract does to the *incentives* and to my resulting payoff (I’m Player 2).

## 1) Baseline game (no contract)
Best responses:
- If the other plays **A0**, my best response is **A0** (5 > 3).
- If the other plays **A1**, my best response is **A1** (3 > 0).

So it’s a coordination (stag-hunt) game: outcomes like (A0,A0)=5 each or (A1,A1)=3 each can happen.

## 2) Contract C1 (Player 1’s proposal)
Rule: choosing **A0** gives +1 (taken from the other); choosing **A1** gives −1 (paid to the other).

Compute my (Player 2) payoffs including transfers:

- (P1 A0, P2 A0): 5 +1 −1 = **5**
- (P1 A0, P2 A1): 0 −1 −1 = **−2**
- (P1 A1, P2 A0): 3 +1 +1 = **5**
- (P1 A1, P2 A1): 3 −1 +1 = **3**

Now **A0 is a dominant strategy for me** (it beats A1 regardless of what P1 does). Symmetrically, A0 becomes dominant for P1 too, so the outcome becomes (A0,A0) with payoff 5 each.

## 3) Contract C2 (Player 2’s proposal)
Rule: choosing **A0** gives +4 (taken from the other); choosing **A1** has no transfer.

My payoffs:

- (P1 A0, P2 A0): 5 +4 −4 = **5**
- (P1 A0, P2 A1): 0 +0 −4 = **−4**
- (P1 A1, P2 A0): 3 +4 +0 = **7**
- (P1 A1, P2 A1): 3 +0 +0 = **3**

Again **A0 is dominant for me**, and also dominant for P1, so we get (A0,A0) with payoff 5 each.

## 4) Which contract do I prefer approving?
Both C1 and C2 force the efficient (A0,A0) outcome if both play rationally, giving me **5** either way.

But if there is any chance the other player plays **A1**, then under C2 my best response **A0** yields **7** (vs **5** under C1). Since I can always choose A0 (dominant) and avoid the bad cases, I prefer selecting **C2** over **C1**.

So I approve **only C2** to increase the chance it is the winning contract.

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which contract(s) I, as **Player 1**, should approve in order to **maximize my total expected points**.

---

### 🔷 Step 1: Understand the Base Game without Contracts

The base payoff matrix (Player 1 is row, Player 2 is column):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5, 5   | 0, 3   |
| **P1: A1**    | 3, 0   | 3, 3   |

This is a classic coordination game with a conflict between mutual cooperation (A0,A0) and mixed outcomes.

Let’s analyze the incentives:

- If I play A0:
  - If opponent plays A0 → I get 5
  - If opponent plays A1 → I get 0 → bad
- If I play A1:
  - If opponent plays A0 → I get 3
  - If opponent plays A1 → I get 3 → consistent

So playing A1 gives me **at least 3**, even if the other player plays A1. Playing A0 risks getting 0 if they play A1.

From my perspective (Player 1), **A1 dominates A0** *in expectation* if there's any uncertainty about the other player’s move — because:
- A0 gives either 5 or 0,
- A1 always gives 3.

But note: **mutual A0 is better for both** (5 each). So there’s a tension between personal gain and joint gain.

However, since the game has **no communication or enforcement**, we must think strategically.

---

### 🔷 Step 2: Consider How the Contract Works

There are two contracts proposed. Each defines additional payments based on your action, paid or received from the other player.

#### General Rule:
- Payments are **transferred from one player to another**.
- The "additional payment" is added to your score.
- These payments are **drawn from the other player(s)** — meaning, if you receive +1 for choosing A0, that 1 point is taken from the other player.
- The payment is **distributed equally among other players** — so if only two players, it’s just taken from the other one directly.

So the effect of a contract is to modify the original payoffs.

We need to compute how these contracts **change the strategic incentives**, and whether **I benefit** from them.

Note: **Approval vote process** — the contract that gets **most approvals** wins. If multiple have same max approvals, one is selected uniformly at random.

But since I’m only deciding on **my approvals**, and want to maximize my **own expected points**, I must consider:

- Will the winning contract make the game better/worse for me?
- Should I support a contract that helps me more?
- But **I cannot force a contract through alone** — if I reject it, it can still win if the other player approves it (and vice versa), so **approval isn't binding**.

Hence, my strategy: **Only approve contracts that are good for *me***, regardless of what the other player does — because I don’t control their decision.

But here's the catch: the outcome depends on **which contract is adopted**, and hence on **both** decisions.

So I must model: **For each contract, will it lead to better outcomes for me?**

---

### 🔷 Step 3: Analyze Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)

> **C1**:  
> - If a player chooses A0 → receives +1 point (paid by others)  
> - If a player chooses A1 → pays -1 point (to others)

This is symmetric: both players face the same rules.

#### Let's update the payoff matrix under C1:

Each player gets an extra +1 for choosing A0, and loses 1 for choosing A1.

So total payoff = (original payoff) + (contract bonus)

Updated matrix:

|               | P2: A0        | P2: A1         |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5+1=6, 5+1=6  | 0+1=1, 3–1=2   |
| **P1: A1**    | 3–1=2, 0–1=–1 | 3–1=2, 3–1=2   |

Wait — careful! When a player chooses A0, they get +1 **from the other player(s)**.

So when **both** choose A0 → each gets +1 → total 6 each.

When **P1 chooses A0**, **P2 chooses A1**:
- P1 gets +1 (for A0)
- P2 gets –1 (for A1)
→ So final scores:
- P1: 0 (base) +1 = **1**
- P2: 3 (base) –1 = **2**

Similarly, P1 A1, P2 A0:
- P1: 3 –1 = 2
- P2: 5 +1 = 6

P1 A1, P2 A1:
- Both lose 1 → 3 –1 = 2 each

So revised matrix:

|               | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 6, 6           | 1, 2           |
| **P1: A1**    | 2, –1          | 2, 2           |

Now, let’s see what **rational choices** emerge under this contract.

Check best responses:

For **Player 1**:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 6 (if A0) vs 2 (if A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 1 (if A0) vs 2 (if A1) → prefers A1

So no dominant strategy — depends on P2.

But now, what is the **Nash equilibrium**?

Let’s suppose both play A1 → result: (2,2)
- P1 benefits from switching to A0 if P2 plays A1? No: from 2 to 1 → worse.

If both play A0 → (6,6): P1 would prefer to deviate to A1 → gets 2 < 6 → no deviation.

Wait: if both play A0 → (6,6) → if P1 unilaterally switches to A1, gets 2 → worse → so stable.

But let’s check full equilibrium.

Check pure Nash equilibria:

1. **(A0, A0)**: (6,6)
   - P1: 6 vs 2 → won’t deviate
   - P2: 6 vs 2 → won’t deviate → **NE**

2. **(A0, A1)**: (1,2)
   - P1: 1; if switch to A1 → 2 > 1 → wants to deviate → not NE

3. **(A1, A0)**: (2, -1)
   - P1: 2 → if switch to A0 → 6? Wait no: if P2 plays A0, P1 playing A0 → 6 > 2 → P1 wants to deviate
   → not NE

4. **(A1, A1)**: (2,2)
   - P1: 2 → if switch to A0 → gets 1 < 2 → doesn’t want to deviate
   - P2: 2 → if switch to A0 → gets 6? Only if P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → then P2 gets 6? From above: (A1,A0): P1=2, P2=–1 → wait no!

Hold on — in (A1, A0), P2 chooses A0 → gets +1 (from contract), so 5 (base) +1 = 6

Yes! So in (A1, A0):
- P2 gets 6
- P1 gets 2

So at (A1, A1): (2,2) → P2 sees that if he switches to A0 (P1 remains A1), P2 gets **6**, which is better than 2 → so P2 wants to deviate.

→ Not NE

So only **(A0,A0)** is a pure Nash equilibrium.

Thus, under C1, the only stable outcome is mutual A0 → **we both get 6 points**.

That’s **better** than base game (where we might get 3 or 5), so likely we’ll end up there.

So **C1 is good for me** → I get 6 instead of possibly less.

Also, note: C1 was **proposed by me** — so it’s favorable to me.

---

### 🔷 Step 4: Analyze Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)

> **C2**:
> - If a player chooses A0 → receives +1 (from others)
> - If a player chooses A1 → pays –2 (to others)

Again, symmetric.

Update matrix:

|               | P2: A0        | P2: A1         |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5+1=6, 5+1=6  | 0+1=1, 3–2=1   |
| **P1: A1**    | 3–2=1, 0–2=–2 | 3–2=1, 3–2=1   |

- (A0,A1): P1 gets 0+1=1; P2 gets 3–2=1 → (1,1)
- (A1,A0): P1 gets 3–2=1; P2 gets 5+1=6 → (1,6)
- (A1,A1): both get 3–2=1 → (1,1)

So updated matrix:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 6,6    | 1,1    |
| **P1: A1**    | 1,6    | 1,1    |

Now find NE.

Check pure NE:

1. **(A0, A0)**: (6,6)
   - P1: 6 vs 1 → holds
   - P2: 6 vs 1 → holds → **NE**

2. **(A0, A1)**: (1,1)
   - P1: 1 → if switch to A1 → gets 1 → same — indifferent? But if both stick, neither wants to change.
     - However, if P1 deviates to A1 → same payoff
     - But P2: currently gets 1 → if switches to A0 → gets 6 → huge incentive → will deviate → not NE

3. **(A1, A0)**: (1,6)
   - P1: 1 → if switches to A0 → gets 6 → will deviate → not NE

4. **(A1, A1)**: (1,1)
   - P1: 1 → if switches to A0 → gets 1 → same → no incentive to deviate
   - P2: 1 → if switches to A0 → gets 6 → will deviate → not NE

So only **(A0,A0)** is NE.

Same result: **only stable outcome is (A0,A0)** → both get 6.

So under C2 as well, the only equilibrium is mutual cooperation → I get 6.

So **both contracts lead to (A0,A0) outcome**?

Interesting. But let’s double-check.

In **C1**, we saw that (A1,A0): P2 gets 6, but P1 gets 2 — so P2 has motivation to cheat to A0 if P1 plays A1.

But in (A1,A1), P2 gets 2 → if he deviates to A0 → gets 6 → big incentive.

So yes, only (A0,A0) is stable.

Same in C2: only (A0,A0) is stable.

So both contracts **encourage mutual A0** — great for both.

Then why would I care?

Let’s compare **what happens if the contract fails** or **we don’t agree on a contract**.

Without a contract, the base game has multiple equilibria:

- (A0,A0) — 5,5 → good
- (A1,A1) — 3,3 → weak coordination

And possibly mixed strategies.

But **(A0,A0)** is Pareto optimal.

But **both players might not coordinate**.

Without contract, if players are rational and independent, they might drift toward A1 → because A1 guarantees at least 3.

But with contracts, **both contract designs shift the incentives to favor A0**.

But again, under both contracts, **the only stable outcome is A0-A0**, so **both lead to 6,6** in equilibrium.

So do they matter equally?

Wait — **only if the contract is approved**, the game changes.

And **a contract only takes effect if both players approve it**.

But here’s the twist: **a contract wins only if it has the maximum number of approvals**.

So if I approve C1 and C2, both get 2 approvals → tie → one randomly chosen → I could get either.

If I approve only C1, and Player 2 approves C2, then C1 gets 1 approval, C2 gets 2 → C2 wins.

If I approve C1, Player 2 approves C1 → C1 wins.

So **my choice affects the chance that my preferred contract wins**.

But here’s the key: **C1 is proposed by me**, so I have stronger preference for it.

But **does it matter which contract wins**?

Let’s compare **for me**:

- Under C1: I get 6 if (A0,A0) occurs → only stable outcome → so 6
- Under C2: same → 6

So **payoff is the same regardless** — 6 points.

But wait — **is (A0,A0) truly the only equilibrium** under both?

Wait — in C2, suppose P2 believes P1 will play A1.

Then P2 knows that if he plays A0, he gets 6 (since P1 plays A1), but if he plays A1, he gets 1.

So indeed, **P2 will choose A0**.

But if P2 chooses A0, then P1, knowing that, would prefer A0 (gets 6) over A1 (gets 1).

So (A0,A0) is attractive.

But could there be **multiple equilibria**?

In C1:
- (A0,A0): 6,6 → stable
- (A1,A1): 2,2 → P2 can deviate to A0 → get 6 → so not stable

Same in C2: (A1,A1): 1,1 → P2 can deviate to A0 → gets 6 → better → not stable

So yes, **only (A0,A0)** survives as NE.

So **under both contracts, outcome is (A0,A0), I get 6**.

So payoff is identical.

BUT: the **contract mechanism** might affect **whether players are willing to approve it**.

But I am only deciding **on my own approvals**.

So if both contracts give me same outcome, then why prefer one?

Wait — there’s a subtlety.

In **C1**, when I play A0, I **receive +1**, and when I play A1, I **pay -1**.

In **C2**, when I play A0, I **receive +1**, and when I play A1, I **pay -2**.

So **under C2, the cost of playing A1 is higher**: I pay 2 instead of 1.

But in both cases, the outcome is driven to (A0,A0), so I'm always playing A0.

So in practice, I never incur the penalty — I always play A0.

So **it doesn't matter what the penalty is** for A1 — I never use it.

Therefore, from a strategic standpoint, both contracts yield **exactly the same result for me**: 6 points.

So I should be indifferent.

But here’s the **crucial point**: **C1 is proposed by me**, and **C2 is proposed by Player 2**.

Is there any difference?

Actually, **no** — I get same outcome.

But wait — **can the contract be beneficial even if I don't use it**?

Yes — if it creates a better equilibrium (which it does: forces A0,A0), then I benefit.

But both do that.

So **same benefit**.

However, **there might be risk in approving both**.

Suppose both contracts pass — then the winning contract is chosen at random — so 50% chance I get C1, 50% chance C2.

But both give me **same payoff**, so no difference.

But suppose I only approve one.

Then:
- If I approve **only C1**, and Player 2 approves **only C2**, then C2 wins (2 approvals), C1 gets 1 → C2 wins → I get C2 → still 6
- If I approve **only C2**, and Player 2 approves only C1 → C1 wins → I get C1 → 6

So either way, I get 6.

But what if **I approve C1 only**, and Player 2 also approves C1? Then C1 wins → I get C1 → 6

Same if I approve only C2 and Player 2 approves only C2 → C2 wins → I get C2 → 6

So in all scenarios, I get 6 points **as long as a contract is adopted**.

But what if **no contract is adopted**?

Then we go back to base game.

In base game, without contract, could we fall into (A1,A1) = 3,3?

Yes — if both believe A1 is safe.

But is (A0,A0) achievable?

It could be, but without commitment, might fail.

But if both approve **some** contract, then the contract will take effect — and the game becomes stable at (A0,A0).

So **if at least one contract passes**, and I’m playing reasonably, we end up at 6,6.

But if **no contract passes**, we’re stuck in base game.

So to **maximize my expected points**, I need to **increase the chance that at least one contract passes**?

But I can only influence **my own approvals**.

Let’s suppose player 2 is rational too.

Player 2, being rational, wants to maximize *their* points.

Under **C1**: Player 2 also gets 6 in equilibrium → better than base case (5 or 3), so **C1 is good for Player 2** → He should approve it.

Under **C2**: similarly, Player 2 gets 6 → so also **good for Player 2** → he should approve it.

So **Player 2 will approve both contracts**.

Now, my actions matter:

- If I approve **neither**: then contracts have 0 approvals → no contract → back to base game.
  - My expected payoff depends on outcome.
  - Possible outcomes:
    - (A0,A0): 5
    - (A1,A1): 3
    - Mixed: maybe average 4? But hard to say.

  But **A1-A1 is a Nash equilibrium** in base game? Let’s check.

  Base game matrix:

  |       | A0 | A1 |
  |-------|----|----|
  | **A0** | 5,5 | 0,3 |
  | **A1** | 3,0 | 3,3 |

  Check (A1,A1): (3,3)
  - If P1 deviates to A0 → gets 0 < 3 → won’t deviate
  - Similarly P2 won’t deviate → **A1,A1 is NE**

  (A0,A0): also NE (5>0 and 5>3)

  So **two pure NE**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

  Also, mixed strategy possible.

  But **without contract**, it’s ambiguous.

  If both players are self-interested and fear being exploited, they might converge to (A1,A1) — because A1 gives 3 no matter what.

  So **expected payoff for me in base game might be around 3**, unless we coordinate.

  But if only one contract passes, or both pass, we get **6**.

  So **6 > 3**, so I strongly prefer any contract to go through.

  Therefore, I **should approve at least one**.

  But both give same payoff.

  Now, what's the worst case?

  - If I approve **both**: then both C1 and C2 have 2 approvals → tie → one chosen at random → I get 6 anyway.

  - If I approve **only C1**: then C1 has 2 approvals (me + P2), C2 has 1 → C1 wins → I get C1 → 6

  - If I approve **only C2**: C2 has 2, C1 has 1 → C2 wins → I get 6

  So **in all cases where at least one contract passes, I get 6**

  The only case I don’t get 6 is if **no contract passes** — i.e., I reject both.

  So to **maximize my chances of getting 6**, I should **approve at least one**.

  Best option: **approve both**.

  Why?

  Because:
  - If I approve both, then **both contracts have 2 approvals** → tie → random selection → I still get 6
  - If I approve only one, and Player 2 approves the other, then the **other** wins → but again I get 6
  - But if I approve only C1, and Player 2 approves C1 → C1 wins → I get 6
  - Same if only C2

  So **no downside to approving both**.

  Is there a downside?

  Suppose Player 2 approves both. Then if I approve both, both have 2 approvals → tie → random selection → I get 6

  If I approve only C1, then C1 has 2, C2 has 2 → still tie → random → I get 6

  So **I always get 6 as long as at least one contract passes**, which happens if Player 2 approves anything **and** I approve something.

  Since Player 2 will probably approve **both** (because both give him 6), then:

  - If I approve **at least one**, at least one contract passes → I get 6
  - If I approve **none**, no contract → I get at most 5, but likely 3 → worse

  So **I must approve at least one**

  And since both are equally good for me, and there is **no cost to approving both**, I should **approve both**.

  But is there a reason **not** to approve one?

  For example, **C1** was proposed by me — is it “mine”? Does that matter?

  But in terms of **outcome**, C1 and C2 are symmetric for me.

  Both lead to (A0,A0) → I get 6.

  The only difference is that **C2 imposes a heavier penalty on A1 (-2 vs -1)** → but since I'll play A0 anyway, it doesn’t hurt me.

  So no reason to avoid C2.

  In fact, if I **don’t** approve C2, and Player 2 approves C2, then **C2 wins (with 2 approvals)** — and I still get 6.

  So **I benefit regardless**.

  Therefore, **approval behavior doesn’t affect the outcome** — as long as **any contract passes**, I get 6.

  And since Player 2 wants 6 (he’s rational), he will approve at least C2 (probably both), so if I approve nothing, **no contract** → I lose.

  So my best move: **approve both contracts**.

  Final reasoning:

  - C1: gives me 6 → worth approving
  - C2: gives me 6 → worth approving
  - Approving both increases the chance that some contract is approved (though already high), but **even if only one is approved**, I still get 6
  - No risk involved
  - I have no reason to reject either

### ✅ Final Decision:

I approve **both contracts**.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine whether you, as Player 2, should sign the contract, let's carefully analyze the situation step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the basic payoffs without the contract

#### Payoff Matrix:
- If Player 2 (you) choose A0:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0: You get 5 points, Player 1 gets 5 points.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1: You get 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
- If Player 2 (you) choose A1:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0: You get 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1: You get 3 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.

### Step 2: Understand the effect of the contract

The contract adds/subtracts points based on the actions chosen:
- If a player chooses A0, they get an additional payment of 1 point taken from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point to the other player.

### Modified Payoff Matrix with Contract:
- If Player 2 (you) choose A0:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0: You get 5 + 1 = 6 points, Player 1 gets 5 + 1 = 6 points.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1: You get 0 + 1 = 1 point, Player 1 gets 3 - 1 = 2 points.
- If Player 2 (you) choose A1:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0: You get 3 - 1 = 2 points, Player 1 gets 0 + 1 = 1 point.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1: You get 3 - 1 = 2 points, Player 1 gets 3 - 1 = 2 points.

### Step 3: Analyze the incentives and outcomes

#### Without the Contract:
- **Pure Nash Equilibrium**: 
  - If Player 1 chooses A0 with probability 1, Player 2 could choose A0 guaranteeing 5 points.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1 with probability 1, Player 2 would ideally choose A1 to get 3 points.

#### With the Contract:
- **Player 1's optimal move**:
  - Choosing A0 becomes more attractive because it guarantees 6 points if both choose A0.
  - Choosing A1, Player 1 would get 2 points if both choose A1, which is less attractive.

- **Player 2's optimal move**:
  - Choosing A0 guarantees 6 points if Player 1 also chooses A0.
  - Choosing A1 only guarantees 2 points.

Both players are motivated to choose A0 under the contract since it maximizes their payoff (6 points each).

### Step 4: Decision on signing the contract

The contract aligns incentives such that both players are more likely to choose A0, which maximizes both players' points. Therefore, signing the contract is beneficial.

### Conclusion

The optimal strategy for maximizing total points leads us to sign the contract:

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Modified Payoffs

First, I need to incorporate the contract into the payoff structure. Since choosing A1 incurs a payment of 1 point to the other player:

**Modified Payoffs (My points, Other's points):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) - no payments
- (A0, A1): (0+1, 3-1) = (1, 2) - Other pays me 1
- (A1, A0): (3-1, 0+1) = (2, 1) - I pay Other 1  
- (A1, A1): (3-1+1, 3-1+1) = (3, 3) - we each pay 1 to each other

## Step 2: Identify Nash Equilibria

Let me check for pure strategy Nash equilibria by seeing if either player wants to deviate:

**At (A0, A0):**
- If I deviate to A1: I get 2 instead of 5 → Don't deviate
- If Other deviates to A1: They get 2 instead of 5 → Don't deviate
- ✓ This is a Nash equilibrium!

**At (A1, A1):**
- If I deviate to A0: I get 1 instead of 3 → Don't deviate
- If Other deviates to A0: They get 1 instead of 3 → Don't deviate
- ✓ This is also a Nash equilibrium!

## Step 3: Compare Outcomes

We have two stable pure strategy equilibria:
1. **(A0, A0): Both get 5 points** ← Clearly best!
2. (A1, A1): Both get 3 points

## Step 4: Consider the Contract's Purpose

The contract was designed (and I proposed it!) specifically to make (A0, A0) a Nash equilibrium. In the original game, A1 was dominant for both players, leading to the suboptimal (A1, A1) outcome. The contract penalizes A1 just enough to make mutual cooperation stable and rational.

## Step 5: Make the Decision

Since:
- (A0, A0) gives me the highest possible payoff (5 points)
- It's a Nash equilibrium - neither player has incentive to deviate
- The contract was specifically designed to enable this cooperation
- A rational player facing the same analysis will also choose A0

I should commit fully to A0.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the Modified Payoff Matrix

First, I need to incorporate the contract into the payoffs. The contract states that choosing A1 costs 1 point, which is paid to the other player.

**Modified Payoffs (My points):**
- (A0, A0): 5 (no contract payments)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 1 = 1 (I receive 1 from other player's A1 penalty)
- (A1, A0): 3 - 1 = 2 (I pay 1 for choosing A1)
- (A1, A1): 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 (I pay 1 but receive 1)

## Step 2: Analyze Pure Strategy Equilibria

Let me check if there are pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- **(A0, A0) → (5, 5)**: If I deviate to A1, I get 2 < 5. ✓ This is a Nash equilibrium
- **(A1, A1) → (3, 3)**: If I deviate to A0, I get 1 < 3. ✓ This is also a Nash equilibrium
- **(A0, A1)**: I would want to deviate to A1 (getting 3 > 1). ✗ Not an equilibrium
- **(A1, A0)**: Other would want to deviate to A1 (getting 3 > 1). ✗ Not an equilibrium

## Step 3: Compare Equilibrium Outcomes

Among the equilibria:
- (A0, A0): I get **5 points** ← Best for me!
- (A1, A1): I get 3 points
- Mixed strategy equilibrium: Would give approximately 2.6 points

## Step 4: Strategic Reasoning

The critical insight is that **Player 2 proposed this contract** via approval voting. This contract specifically:
- Penalizes A1 choices
- Transforms the game to make (A0, A0) the clearly dominant outcome
- Makes (A0, A0) a stable Nash equilibrium with the highest payoff for both players

This suggests Player 2 is signaling an intention to play A0 to achieve the mutually beneficial (5, 5) outcome.

## Step 5: Best Response

If I believe Player 2 will play A0 (which the contract design strongly suggests):
- Playing A0 gives me 5 points
- Playing A1 gives me 2 points

Therefore, my best response is to play A0 with certainty.

## Conclusion

Given that the contract was designed to promote cooperation at (A0, A0), which is the Pareto optimal outcome benefiting both players maximally, the rational strategy is to coordinate on this equilibrium.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are playing a simultaneous move game where each player chooses A0 or A1 with some probability. We are Player 2.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P2: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

This is a coordination game with a conflict of interest:
- Both get 5 if both play A0 → best outcome for both.
- But if one plays A0 and the other A1, the one playing A1 gets 3, the one playing A0 gets 0 → so there's an incentive to "free ride".
- When both play A1, both get 3.

So:
- (A0, A0) is Pareto superior to (A1, A1), but not a Nash equilibrium (because each has incentive to deviate).
- (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium (no one gains by unilaterally switching).
- (A0, A1) and (A1, A0) are not stable.

But since we’re interested in strategic behavior and potentially cooperating via a contract, we now consider the **contract design**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract System**

- Contracts are *optional*.
- Players vote on contracts via **approval voting**.
- The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- So we want to approve **contracts that benefit us**.
- We are **Player 2**.

Two contracts proposed:

---

### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- Choosing A0 → +1 point (paid by the other player).
- Choosing A1 → -1 point (paid to the other player).

This is symmetric: same rules for both players.

Let’s analyze how this affects incentives.

---

### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So:
- A0 → +2 (paid by the other player)
- A1 → 0 (no cost, no benefit)

This is **asymmetric** and **benefits A0 players by 2**, while A1 players are unaffected.

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Contract from Player 2’s Perspective**

We are Player 2. We need to ask: 
> If this contract is implemented, **does it increase my expected payoff** compared to the baseline or other contracts?

We need to consider:
- Will I be more likely to choose A0 or A1 under the contract?
- What is the new equilibrium?
- Would this contract make it better for me?

But note: The contract is applied to **every player**, so both are subject to it.

Also, since the winner is **randomly selected from the most-approved contracts**, we want to **approve contracts that are beneficial to us** and **possibly beneficial to others**, **but always make sure we don’t lose out**.

So, our strategy: approve a contract if it **increases our expected payoff**, assuming rational behavior (and possibly Nash equilibrium play under the contract).

---

### **Analyze Contract C1: +1 for A0, -1 for A1**

This contract modifies the payoff matrix.

Let’s compute the **total payoff** (original + contract) for Player 2.

Note: The contract payouts are drawn from the other player, so the total sum remains unchanged, but distributed unevenly.

Let’s compute the **total payoff** under C1.

#### Case 1: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0
- Original: (5, 5)
- Contract: both get +1 (since both played A0)
- So: (6, 6)

#### Case 2: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1
- Original: (0, 3)
- Contract: P1 (A0) gets +1; P2 (A1) pays -1
- So: P1: 0 + 1 = 1; P2: 3 - 1 = 2
- New: (1, 2)

#### Case 3: P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0
- Original: (3, 0)
- Contract: P1 (A1) pays -1; P2 (A0) gets +1
- So: P1: 3 - 1 = 2; P2: 0 + 1 = 1
- New: (2, 1)

#### Case 4: P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1
- Original: (3, 3)
- Contract: both pay -1 → (3-1, 3-1) = (2, 2)

So the new payoff matrix (P1, P2):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | (6,6)  | (2,1)  |
| **P2: A1**    | (1,2)  | (2,2)  |

Now, let’s find the **best responses** for Player 2.

Suppose P1 plays A0:
- P2: A0 → 6; A1 → 2 → prefers A0

Suppose P1 plays A1:
- P2: A0 → 1; A1 → 2 → prefers A1

So P2’s best response depends on P1.

Now for P1:

P2 plays A0:
- P1: A0 → 6; A1 → 1 → prefers A0

P2 plays A1:
- P1: A0 → 2; A1 → 2 → indifferent

So:
- If P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1, P1 is indifferent → could play either

Now consider equilibria.

Can (A0, A0) happen?
- P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A0 → yes
- P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 → yes
→ (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

Can (A1, A1) happen?
- P1: if P2 plays A1, P1 is indifferent → can play A1
- P2: if P1 plays A1, P2 prefers A1 → yes
→ (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

So two equilibria. But which one do rational players pick?

(A0, A0) gives 6 each — much better than (A1, A1) with 2 each.

Also, (A0, A0) is **strictly better** for both than any other outcome.

So, if both players are rational, they should *coordinate* on (A0, A0) — it's a **risk-dominant** and **Pareto-efficient** outcome.

So likely, under C1, players will play (A0, A0), and get 6 each.

→ Expected payoff for **Player 2**: 6

Compare to **baseline** game: what’s the likely outcome?

In the original game, no contract:
- (A0, A0): 5,5
- (A1, A1): 3,3
- But (A0, A0) is not stable: if you think opponent plays A0, you prefer A1 → 3 > 0? Wait no:

Wait! In original game, if P1 plays A0, P2’s payoffs:
- A0 → 5
- A1 → 3 → so P2 prefers A0

If P1 plays A1:
- A0 → 0
- A1 → 3 → so P2 prefers A1

So best response:
- P2: if P1 plays A0 → A0; if P1 plays A1 → A1
→ symmetric to above.

P1 has same incentives:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 prefers A1

So again, two pure equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But which one? (A0,A0) is better for both.

But in the absence of coordination, players might fail to coordinate — but if both are rational and trust each other, they might both play A0.

But in many such games, (A1,A1) is a **focal point** because it's safe and symmetric.

In fact, (A0,A0) is risky — if you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 0 — while A1 is safer (you get 3).

So maybe (A1,A1) is more likely.

But we’re interested in whether **C1 improves Player 2’s payoff**.

Under C1, we have incentive to play A0, and (A0,A0) is a stable equilibrium with **6 each**.

So if players coordinate on A0, we get 6 — better than baseline.

But in the baseline, if players coordinate on A0, we get 5.

So C1 **gives us 6 instead of 5**, assuming coordination.

Even if coordination fails and they play (A1,A1), we get 2 under C1, whereas in baseline: 3.

So if they end up at (A1,A1), we **lose** under C1: 2 < 3.

But in C1, (A0,A0) is **more attractive**, while (A1,A1) is less attractive.

So overall, C1 **increases the incentive to coordinate on A0**, likely leading to higher payoff for us.

But let’s compare to C2.

---

### **Analyze Contract C2: +2 for A0, 0 for A1**

So:
- If you play A0 → +2
- If you play A1 → 0

So this **only benefits A0**, not A1.

Let’s compute new payoffs.

#### Case 1: P1 A0, P2 A0
- Original: (5,5)
- Add +2 to both (since both played A0)
- → (7,7)

#### Case 2: P1 A0, P2 A1
- Original: (0,3)
- P2 played A1 → no extra
- P1 played A0 → gets +2
- So P1: 0+2 = 2; P2: 3
→ (2,3)

#### Case 3: P1 A1, P2 A0
- Original: (3,0)
- P2 played A0 → gets +2
- P1 played A1 → no extra
- So P1: 3; P2: 0+2 = 2
→ (3,2)

#### Case 4: P1 A1, P2 A1
- Original: (3,3)
- Both played A1 → no bonus
- So (3,3)

New payoff matrix (P1, P2):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | (7,7)  | (3,2)  |
| **P2: A1**    | (2,3)  | (3,3)  |

Now analyze best responses.

For **Player 2**:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2: A0 → 7, A1 → 3 → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1 → P2: A0 → 2, A1 → 3 → prefers A1

→ So P2’s best response depends on P1.

For **Player 1**:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1: A0 → 7, A1 → 3 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1 → P1: A0 → 2, A1 → 3 → prefers A1

So again, the same structure: two equilibria:
- (A0,A0): both prefer A0 if opponent plays A0
- (A1,A1): both prefer A1 if opponent plays A1

Now, which equilibrium is more likely?

(A0,A0): 7 each — very good.
(A1,A1): 3 each — same as original.

So (A0,A0) is **much better**.

Under C2, if players coordinate, we get **7**.

Even if they play (A1,A1), we get **3** — same as in baseline (3 points).

Compare:
- C1: if coordinate → 6; if not → 2
- C2: if coordinate → 7; if not → 3

Both contracts *make coordination on A0 more attractive*, but C2 gives us **more** in case of coordination.

Also, C2 **does not punish A1**, so if coordination fails, we still get 3 — same as baseline.

But in C1, if we end up at (A1,A1), we get only 2 — worse than 3.

So **C2 is better** for us in both cases:
- If coordination succeeds: 7 > 6
- If coordination fails: 3 > 2

So **C2 gives us a higher minimum payoff** and a higher best payoff.

But wait — **is C2 fair?** Does it **benefit us more**?

Yes — because it gives **+2 to A0**, which both of us can use, but we are Player 2.

And since both players benefit from A0, one might expect a symmetric outcome.

But the key is: **does C2 make it more likely that we both play A0?**

Yes — because (A0,A0) is even more attractive: 7 each now.

So likely outcome: (A0,A0) with 7 each.

But in C1, it's 6 each.

So **C2 is better** for us.

But now consider **who proposed it** — Player 2.

So **C2 is proposed by us**.

We are only voting on it — so we can approve it.

But we need to ask: **should we approve C2?**

Yes — because:
- It increases the payoff if we play A0 (our main strategy).
- It doesn’t hurt us if we end up at A1.
- It encourages coordination on A0 — which is better for us.

Now back to C1 — proposed by Player 1.

If C1 is approved, we get 6 (if coordinated), 2 (if not).

C2 gives us 7 (if coordinated), 3 (if not).

So **C2 is clearly superior to C1 for us**.

But we don’t know what the other players will do.

But since we are **Player 2**, and **we are deciding which contracts to approve**, we want to **approve only those that are good for us**.

Also: the winning contract is chosen at random from those with **maximum approvals**.

So if many players approve C2, it might win — and we get 7.

If many approve C1, it might win — we get max 6.

But if we approve **only C2**, then we have a better chance of getting a better contract.

But we can approve both — but we might help someone else get a worse outcome.

But the question is: **do we approve a contract?**

We should approve contracts that are **good for us**.

So:

- **C1: Do we approve?** → It’s not as good as C2 → but still better than baseline in some cases, worse in others.
  - In the best case: we get 6 vs 7 → worse.
  - In the worst case: 2 vs 3 → worse.
  - So **C1 is strictly worse than C2 for us**.
  → So even if it improves the game slightly (compared to no contract), it's still **worse** than C2.

Therefore, **we should not approve C1**.

But what if no one approves C2? Then C1 might be selected.

But still — we are deciding based on **expected benefit**.

The only way C1 helps us is if coordination is hard and we end up at (A0,A0), but C2 still gives better outcome.

Since **C2 dominates C1** for us, **we should approve C2 and not approve C1**.

But wait — could **C1** cause a higher coordination on A0?

Possibly, but the **incentive** in C2 is **stronger**: from 5 → 7 (vs 5 → 6 in C1), so C2 creates a **larger incentive** to play A0.

So **C2 is better**.

Also, **C1 penalizes A1**, which may drive people to play A0, but it also punishes us if we play A1 — so if someone plays A1, we lose.

But in C2, A1 players are not punished — so if coordination fails, we are not hurt.

So **C2 is safer and better**.

Therefore, **we should approve C2 and disapprove C1**.

---

### **Final Check: What if other players also approve?**

But we are only concerned with **our own approval**.

We want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

Approving C2 → we get 7 if coordinated, 3 otherwise.
Approving C1 → we get 6 or 2.

So **C2 is better**.

Even if only one contract is approved, we prefer C2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which contracts you (as Player 1) should approve, based on your objective: **maximize your total points**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

The game matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2) is:

|           | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Player 1 A0** | (5, 5)      | (0, 3)      |
| **Player 1 A1** | (3, 0)      | (3, 3)      |

This is a classic coordination game with a twist.

- If both play A0: both get 5 → best mutual outcome.
- If one plays A0 and the other A1: the A0 player gets 0, the A1 player gets 3 → bad for the A0 player.
- If both play A1: both get 3 → worse than (5,5) but better than being exploited.

Let’s analyze strategic incentives.

#### **Best responses for Player 1:**
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - P1 A0 → 5
  - P1 A1 → 3
  → Better to play A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - P1 A0 → 0
  - P1 A1 → 3
  → Better to play A1

So Player 1’s best response depends on Player 2’s action. There is no dominant strategy.

#### **Nash Equilibria (Pure):**
- (A0, A0): Yes, since neither wants to deviate.
- (A1, A1): Yes, since if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 from A1 vs 0 from A0 → so doesn't want to deviate. Same for P2. So (A1, A1) is a NE.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 → would prefer A1 → not a NE.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3 → would prefer A0? No, A0 gives 0 in that case → but P1 is already playing A1, and if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 3 from A1 vs 5 from A0 → so wants to deviate to A0 → so not a NE.

So two pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But (A0,A0) is better for both. Still, (A1,A1) is a stable equilibrium.

Now: **in the absence of contracts, what’s the likely outcome?** It depends on coordination. But since (A0,A0) gives the highest payoff, if they can coordinate, that’s ideal.

But without communication, both may fear being exploited and go for A1, risking (A1,A1) instead.

So a contract could help coordinate on (A0,A0) or improve upon it.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

We have two proposed contracts:

---

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Let’s interpret:
- Whoever plays A0 gets +1 (paid by the other player).
- Whoever plays A1 pays -1 (paid to the other player).

Since there is only one other player, “drawn equally from the other players” just means: **the other player pays or receives the extra 1 point**.

So the contract changes the payoff based on action.

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix under C1**.

Let’s denote the base payoff plus contract adjustment.

For **Player 1 choosing A0**:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 + 1 = 6, P2 gets 5 - 1 = 4
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 + 1 = 1, P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2

For **Player 1 choosing A1**:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3 - 1 = 2, P2 gets 0 + 1 = 1
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 3 - 1 = 2, P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2

So new payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|           | P2 A0       | P2 A1       |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **P1 A0** | (6, 4)      | (1, 2)      |
| **P1 A1** | (2, 1)      | (2, 2)      |

Now analyze this.

#### **Best responses under C1:**

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1: A0 → 6, A1 → 2 → better to play A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 2 → better to play A1

So still no dominant strategy. But:

- (A0,A0): P1 gets 6, P2 gets 4 → both better than before.
- (A1,A1): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 2 → worse than before (they used to get 3).

Now check equilibria:

- (A0, A0): P1 gets 6; if P1 deviates to A1, gets 2 → bad. P2 gets 4; if P2 deviates to A1 (P1 plays A0), P2 gets 2 → worse. So (A0,A0) is a NE.
- (A1,A1): P1 gets 2; if P1 deviates to A0 (P2 plays A1), gets 1 → worse. But P2: from 2 → if deviates to A0 (P1 plays A1), gets 1 → worse. So (A1,A1) is still a NE, but worse.

But crucially: **(A0, A0) is now the only NE that gives P1 high payoff**.

Moreover: **P1 is strongly incentivized to play A0 if P2 plays A0**, and even if P2 plays A1, P1 gets only 1 from A0 vs 2 from A1. But if P2 is rational, she knows from A1 she gets 2 (vs 1 if she plays A0 when P1 plays A1).

Wait — let’s look at Player 2's incentives under C1:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 A0 → 4, A1 → 2 → so prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 A0 → 1, A1 → 2 → so prefers A1

So P2 also has a best response that depends.

But now, notice: in (A0,A0), both are best responding. In (A1,A1), both are best responding — but P1 gets only 2, down from 3.

However, under C1, **A0 is clearly better for P1 when P2 plays A0**, and **if P2 expects P1 to play A0 and wants to coordinate, she prefers A0**.

So **C1 shifts incentives toward (A0,A0)**.

In fact, in (A0,A0), P1 gets 6 — much better than the base game (5). Even though in (A1,A1) P1 gets only 2, which is worse than 3 — so that’s bad **only if (A1,A1) persists**.

But the **key point**: because (A0,A0) now leads to a big reward for A0 players, and A1 players lose, **rational players should be more likely to coordinate on (A0,A0)**.

So C1 benefits P1 **if it leads to A0-A0 coordination**, which is more likely now.

P1 gets 6 in (A0,A0), vs 5 before → **better**.

But if the contract fails (e.g., if it's not approved), and the game goes to base rules, P1 might get 5 in (A0,A0), or 3 in (A1,A1). So the **expected value is higher under C1 if coordination on (A0,A0) increases**.

Since C1 makes A0 attractive and A1 costly, it **increases the chance of (A0,A0)**.

So **C1 is beneficial for P1**.

But wait: is **C1 self-enforcing in terms of approval?** You are Player 1, and C1 is **proposed by Player 1**. You are the one who can approve or not.

But you are deciding whether to **approve** this contract.

So you must ask: **Will I get more expected payoff if C1 is approved and used, vs if it’s not?**

Yes — because it pushes the game toward (A0,A0), where you get 6 instead of 5, and (A1,A1) is now a much worse outcome (you get 2 vs 3) — so it removes a bad equilibrium.

So you *want* C1 to be used.

But also: **you are Player 1**, and you are the proposer.

You are asked to **approve** or not.

If **you approve**, then the contract goes to the approval voting process. The winning contract is chosen **uniformly at random from those with the maximum approvals**.

So it’s not just about your approval — it’s about **how many approvals the contract gets**.

But note: only **you** are making the decision here. (The other player is not interacting — we are only simulating your decision.)

So we must assume that **your approval is the only one that matters for your evaluation**, but **you want to maximize the chance that a contract that benefits you is implemented**.

But the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the most approvals**.

So if you only approve one contract, it wins if no other contract has more approvals — but since only you are voting, **you control the approvals**.

Let’s suppose that in reality, **Player 2** will vote independently — but since we are only determining your vote, we must assume you're trying to **maximize your expected payoff**, considering **both**:
- What happens if your contract is approved
- Whether the contract benefits you

Let’s now analyze **C2**.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So: only A1 players pay -1; A0 players get nothing extra.

Again, other player gets the -1.

So new payoffs:

For **Player 1 choosing A0**:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 + 0 = 5, P2 gets 5 + 0 = 5
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 + 0 = 0, P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2

For **Player 1 choosing A1**:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3 - 1 = 2, P2 gets 0 + 1 = 1
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 3 - 1 = 2, P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2

So new matrix:

|           | P2 A0       | P2 A1       |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **P1 A0** | (5, 5)      | (0, 2)      |
| **P1 A1** | (2, 1)      | (2, 2)      |

Now analyze.

#### **Player 1's best responses under C2:**

- If P2 plays A0: P1 A0 → 5, A1 → 2 → better to play A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 A0 → 0, A1 → 2 → better to play A1

Still depends.

Check equilibria:
- (A0, A0): P1 gets 5, P2 gets 5 → both happy. If P1 deviates to A1, gets 2 → worse. P2 deviates → gets 1 → worse. So NE.
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 2 → but P2: if P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A1, she gets 2. If she deviates to A0 (P1 plays A1), she gets 1 → worse. P1: deviate to A0? Gets 0 → worse. So NE.

But notice: in (A0, A0), P1 gets **5** — same as base game.

In (A1, A1), P1 gets **2** — worse than 3 in base game.

So this contract **only makes (A0,A0) worse** for Player 2 (because P2 gets 5 in C2 as per matrix — same as base), but makes (A1,A1) **worse** for both.

But most importantly: **Player 1's best outcome remains (A0,A0)** with 5.

So is this beneficial?

Compare to base game:
- (A0,A0): still 5
- (A1,A1): now 2 instead of 3 → worse

So **this contract hurts P1 in case of (A1,A1)**, but doesn’t help in (A0,A0).

Moreover, **A1 is now punished**, so it may reduce the chance of (A1,A1), which is good.

But also: **A0 gives the same payoff**, no bonus.

So it **doesn’t incentivize** P1 to play A0 — it’s still not better than A1 if P2 plays A1.

In fact, under C2:
- If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 0 from A0, 2 from A1 — so still prefers A1.
- Only if P2 plays A0 is A0 better.

So **the incentive to coordinate on A0 is weakened**? Not really: the only thing changed is that A1 now has a cost, but **P1 gains no benefit from A0**.

So (A0,A0) still exists, but **P1 gains no extra reward for A0** — only the cost of A1 is introduced.

But crucially: **P1 is not getting any reward for playing A0**, unlike in C1.

So C2 **does not increase the payoff to P1 when both play A0** — it stays at 5.

In C1, P1 gets 6 in (A0,A0) — **so better**.

In C2, P1 gets only 5 in (A0,A0).

So **C1 gives P1 a higher payoff in the ideal case**.

Moreover, C1 **makes A0 more attractive** (you get +1), while C2 **only makes A1 less attractive** — same effect but **no reward for A0**.

So **C1 is superior to C2 for P1**.

Now — **what happens if both contracts are approved**?

The winning contract is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum approvals**.

If you approve C1 only:
- C1 has 1 approval
- C2 has 0 → C1 wins

If you approve C2 only:
- C2 has 1 → wins

If you approve both:
- Both have 1 approval → max approval is 1 → winning contract picked uniformly at random from {C1, C2} → each has 50% chance.

If you approve neither:
- No contract → base game applies → you get 5 (if (A0,A0)) or 3 (if (A1,A1)) — expected depends on coordination.

But let’s compare the **expected payoff under each case**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare Expected Payoffs Under Each Approval Strategy**

We assume that **rational players will end up in a Nash equilibrium** after the contract is applied.

We also assume that **with a contract, coordination is easier**, especially if the contract improves incentives.

Let’s assess:

---

#### **Case 1: Approve only C1**

→ C1 wins (since no other approvals).

Under C1, as computed:
- (A0,A0) is a NE with payoff (6,4)
- (A1,A1) is a NE with (2,2)

So two equilibria.

But **(A0,A0) gives P1 6**, which is better than base (5), and (A1,A1) gives P1 only 2, worse than base (3).

So **if coordination on (A0,A0) is possible, P1 gets 6**.

In fact, because (A0,A0) is now so much better (6) and (A1,A1) is worse (2), **rational players are more likely to coordinate on (A0,A0)**.

So **expected payoff for P1 under C1 is very high** — likely 6, assuming coordination.

Even if there is some risk, but since (A0,A0) is a strong equilibrium and better, it's the likely focal point.

So **E[P1 | C1] ≈ 6**

---

#### **Case 2: Approve only C2**

→ C2 wins.

Under C2:
- (A0,A0) is NE: payoff (5,5)
- (A1,A1) is NE: (2,2)

But **P1 gets only 5 in the best case**, same as base game.

(There is no bonus for A0.)

Also, (A0,A0) is still a NE, but not better than in base game.

Moreover, in C2, if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 0 from A0 vs 2 from A1 → still prefers A1.

So unless P2 plays A0, P1 doesn’t want to play A0.

But P2, if P1 plays A0, is happy to play A0 (gets 5 > 2), so she might coordinate.

But no incentive for **you (P1)** to play A0 — only if P2 does.

So **coordination might still be difficult**, unlike C1 where A0 gives +1 — a strong signal.

So **E[P1 | C2] ≈ 5** — same as base game (if (A0,A0) is played), or less if (A1,A1) is played.

Not better than base.

So **C2 offers no improvement over base game for P1**.

---

#### **Case 3: Approve both C1 and C2**

→ Both get 1 approval → so winning contract is chosen **uniformly at random** between C1 and C2.

So:
- 50% chance C1 → P1 gets ~6
- 50% chance C2 → P1 gets ~5

Expected payoff: **(0.5)(6) + (0.5)(5) = 3 + 2.5 = 5.5**

But note: under base game, if (A0,A0) is played, P1 gets 5; if (A1,A1), 3.

But in a symmetric game like this, **if no communication, people might split**, but in practice, (A0,A0) is the Pareto-optimal choice.

But we can assume **if no contract, coordination on (A0,A0) is possible** — so expected payoff under base game might be ~5 (if players cooperate), or lower if they fear being exploited.

But **in any case, 5.5 is better than 5**.

But is it better than approving only C1?

- Approve only C1 → 100% chance of C1 → P1 gets ~6
- Approve both → 50% chance of 6, 50% chance of 5 → expected 5.5

So **6 > 5.5** → better to approve only C1.

---

#### **Case 4: Approve neither**

→ No contract → base game.

Equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Suppose both are possible. If players coordinate, P1 gets 5.

But if not, maybe (A1,A1). But (A0,A0) is better.

We can assume **players will coordinate on (A0,A0)**, so P1 gets 5.

If coordination is not perfect, maybe mixed — but even in mixed NE, expected payoff is at least 3.

But **5 is a reasonable estimate**.

So E[P1 | no contract] ≈ 5

But C1 gives 6, so better.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **C1 (proposed by P1)**: gives P1 **6 in (A0,A0)**, strengthens coordination, reduces risk of (A1,A1). **Highly beneficial**.
- **C2 (proposed by P2)**: gives P1 **only 5 in (A0,A0)**, no bonus, doesn't improve incentives to play A0. **No benefit over base game**.

Therefore:

- You **should approve C1** → gives high payoff
- You **should not approve C2** → it gives no extra benefit, and **if both are approved**, you risk getting C2 (5) instead of C1 (6), which reduces your expected payoff.

So best strategy: **approve only C1**

This ensures that if C1 is winning (which it will be, if approved), you get 6.

But if you approve C2, and both get 1 approval, then **50% chance of getting only 5**, which is worse than 6.

Therefore: **approve C1, disapprove C2**

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
```
                Opponent A0    Opponent A1
I play A0            5              0
I play A1            3              3
```

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving both players 5 points, and (A1, A1) giving both players 3 points.

## Step 2: Calculate Payoffs Under Each Contract

**Under Contract 1:**
- Choosing A0: +1 point (received from opponent)
- Choosing A1: -1 point (paid to opponent)

My modified payoffs:
```
                Opponent A0    Opponent A1
I play A0            5              2
I play A1            1              3
```

**Under Contract 2:**
- Choosing A0: 0 additional
- Choosing A1: -1 point (paid to opponent)

My modified payoffs:
```
                Opponent A0    Opponent A1
I play A0            5              1
I play A1            2              3
```

## Step 3: Analyze Mixed Strategy Equilibria

For each scenario, I can find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium by calculating when I'm indifferent between actions:

**No Contract:** Indifferent when opponent plays A0 with probability 3/5
- This means if opponent plays A0 more than 60% of the time, I should choose A0

**Contract 1:** Indifferent when opponent plays A0 with probability 1/5
- If opponent plays A0 more than 20% of the time, I should choose A0

**Contract 2:** Indifferent when opponent plays A0 with probability 2/5
- If opponent plays A0 more than 40% of the time, I should choose A0

## Step 4: Determine Which Contracts Help Coordination

The lower the indifference probability, the larger the "basin of attraction" for the (A0, A0) equilibrium. This means:
- **Contract 1** makes it easiest to coordinate on (A0, A0) - only need 20% belief opponent plays A0
- **Contract 2** is intermediate - need 40% belief
- **No contract** is hardest - need 60% belief

Since (A0, A0) gives both players 5 points (the best outcome), contracts that make this coordination easier are beneficial.

## Step 5: Decision

Both contracts help facilitate coordination on the efficient (A0, A0) equilibrium compared to no contract. Contract 1 does this most effectively, but Contract 2 also improves coordination. Since both contracts make it more likely that both players achieve the optimal 5 points, I should approve both.

response:
Let's go step by step to determine which contract(s) you should approve as Player 1, under the given game rules, payoff structure, and the contract approval mechanism.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

The payoff matrix (Player 1’s perspective):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 5, 5         | 0, 3         |
| **Player 1: A1** | 3, 0         | 3, 3         |

Let’s analyze the **Nash equilibria** and best responses in this base game.

#### **Best Responses:**

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1 gets: 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1 gets: 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So Player 1’s best response is:
- A0 if Player 2 plays A0
- A1 if Player 2 plays A1

Likewise for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0: 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 1 plays A1: 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So both players have **mixed strategy best responses**.

Let’s compute the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ p $
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability $ q $

We find $ p $ such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- A0: $ 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p $
- A1: $ 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 $

Set equal for indifference:  
$ 5p = 3 $ → $ p = 3/5 = 0.6 $

Similarly, for Player 1 to be indifferent:
- Player 1’s payoff from A0: $ 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q $
- Payoff from A1: $ 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 $

Set equal: $ 5q = 3 $ → $ q = 3/5 = 0.6 $

So in the **unique mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**, both players play A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

Now, compute **expected payoff** in equilibrium:

For Player 1:
- If A0: $ 5q + 0(1-q) = 5×0.6 = 3 $
- If A1: $ 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 $
→ So expected payoff = 3 (since indifferent)

But wait: in mixed strategy, the expected value is just the payoff when you play any action, since you're indifferent.

So both players get **3 points** in equilibrium.

But note: **if both players coordinate on A0**, they get **5 each** — that’s better than 3.

But since the game has no coordination mechanism, and it's a simultaneous move game with no communication, the natural outcome is the mixed equilibrium.

So **baseline expected payoff: 3 points**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

We are evaluating two proposed contracts. We are Player 1, so we want to **maximize our expected total points**.

The contract will be applied *in addition* to the base game payoffs. The contract specifies an external payment that is transferred between players based on the action chosen.

#### **Key rules about contracts:**
- A contract must be **approved by both players** to be in force.
- But the winning contract is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.
- So **only contracts that are approved by both** will be considered? No — actually:

> "The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So even if only one player approves a contract, it can still win, **if it has the highest number of approvals**.

So for example:
- If C1 is approved by 1 person, C2 by 1 person → both have max approvals → random between them
- If C1: 2 approvals, C2: 1 → C1 wins
- If C1: 1, C2: 0 → C1 wins

So to increase the chance of a contract being selected, you want to **approve only contracts that are favorable to you, but potentially encourage others to approve them too**.

But since **you only control your own approval**, and the final winning contract is random among those with the **maximum number of approvals**, your best strategy is to **approve contracts that maximize your expected payoff, given that the contract is selected**, and **maximize your influence over which contract is selected**.

But here's the catch: the other player (Player 2) is also making decisions. You don’t know their approval preferences. But you **must** decide which contracts to approve based on **your expectations of what will happen**.

We must assume **you can compute the equilibrium outcomes** under each contract, and **choose your approvals to maximize your expected payoff**.

But you need to consider:
- Which contracts you approve
- What the other player is likely to approve (but you don’t know)
- The impact of the contract on incentives
- The final contract is randomly selected from those with the **highest number** of approvals

So your goal: **maximize expected payoff**, assuming rational behavior and that the final contract is selected as described.

---

### **Let’s analyze each contract in detail.**

---

## **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If both play A0: 
  - Each gets base 5 + 1 (from A0) = 6
  - But since both get +1, and payments are drawn from the other player, this implies:
    - Each pays 1 to the other → net: no change? Wait, need to model carefully.

Let’s clarify:

- "receive an additional payment of 1" → they get +1
- "drawn equally from the other players" → so the money comes from the other player(s)

There are two players, so:
- If a player plays A0 → they get +1, which is **taken from the other player**
- If a player plays A1 → they pay -1, so they **lose 1**, and the other player receives it

So:
- If Player 1 plays A0, they get +1
- Player 2 plays A0 → gets +1
- The +1 comes from the **opponent**, so:
  - If P1 plays A0, P2 gives him 1
  - If P1 plays A1, P1 gives 1 to P2

So the **transfer** is:
- P1 pays P2: 1 if P1 plays A1
- P1 receives 1 from P2: if P1 plays A0
- Similarly for P2: receives 1 from P1 if P2 plays A0, pays 1 to P1 if P2 plays A1

So the **net transfer per player** is:
- From a player’s action:
  - A0 → gain 1 from opponent
  - A1 → loss 1 to opponent

So overall payoffs become:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 5 + 1 = 6, 5 + 1 = 6 | 0 + 1 = 1, 3 - 1 = 2 |
| A1     | 3 - 1 = 2, 0 + 1 = 1 | 3 - 1 = 2, 3 - 1 = 2 |

So new payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A0     | 6, 6   | 1, 2   |
| A1     | 2, 1   | 2, 2   |

Now, let’s find the pure strategy Nash equilibria.

Check:
- (A0, A0): 6 vs 6 — if P1 deviates to A1: gets 2 < 6 → no incentive; same for P2 → **NE**
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 2 → P1 wants to deviate to A1 → gets 2 > 1 (if P2 plays A1) → so yes: P1 gets 2 > 1 → so P1 can improve → not NE
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 1 → P2 wants to deviate to A0 → would get 6 > 1 → so yes, deviate → not NE
- (A1, A1): both get 2 → if P1 deviates to A0: gets 1 < 2 → no; same for P2 → **NE**

So two pure NEs: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Now, mixed strategy?

Let’s see: the game is now symmetric?

Not really — but let’s check if (A0, A0) is better.

In (A0, A0): both get 6 → **much better** than base game (which was 3).

In (A1, A1): both get 2 → worse than base.

But in a symmetric game, (A0, A0) is more likely to be reached if players coordinate.

But can we find **dominant strategies**?

Check:
- For P1: 
  - A0: if P2 plays A0 → 6, if A1 → 1
  - A1: if P2 plays A0 → 2, if A1 → 2
  - So A0 is better if P2 plays A0, worse if P2 plays A1
- Similarly for P2.

So no dominant strategy.

But now: **(A0, A0)** is a strict Nash equilibrium (both get higher than any deviation).

Can players coordinate on (A0, A0)? Possibly, since it’s symmetric and high payoff.

Let’s compute expected payoff under **mixed strategy NE**.

Let P1 play A0 with probability $ p $, P2 with $ q $

P1’s payoff from A0: $ 6q + 1(1 - q) = 5q + 1 $

P1’s payoff from A1: $ 2q + 2(1 - q) = 2 $

Set equal: $ 5q + 1 = 2 $ → $ 5q = 1 $ → $ q = 0.2 $

Similarly for P2: $ 5p + 1 = 2 $ → $ p = 0.2 $

So mixed equilibrium: both play A0 with 0.2

Expected payoff:  
P1’s expected payoff = 2 (since indifferent, and A1 gives 2)

So in mixed equilibrium: **P1 gets 2**

But earlier: (A0, A0) gives 6, (A1, A1) gives 2.

Is (A0, A0) an **evolutionarily stable** strategy? Or more importantly — can players **coordinate**?

But in absence of communication, they might still coordinate on (A0, A0) due to symmetry and high payoff.

But let’s assume **rational players** will play a Nash equilibrium. So outcomes could be:
- (A0, A0): both get 6
- (A1, A1): both get 2
- Or a mixed strategy: P1 gets 2

Now, **if both players are rational, will they play (A0, A0)?**

Let’s see: if both have a preference for (A0, A0), and it’s a strict NE, it might be focal point.

But the **risk** is that if one thinks the other will play A1, they might fear being exploited (get only 1).

But in this modified game, if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 1, which is less than if you played A1 and got 2.

So there's **risk in cooperating**.

But now, notice: **the payoffs are symmetric** in C1.

Let’s suppose both players **cooperate** on (A0, A0). Then they both get **6**.

But in the original game, they get only 3 in equilibrium. So C1 **improved** the outcome.

But is it stable? Only if both are confident they can coordinate.

But given that (A0, A0) is a **Nash equilibrium**, and strictly better than the mixed strategy, **it's plausible** that players might converge to it.

Now, **your expected payoff under C1**, if it's in effect, depends on the equilibrium.

But you **are** Player 1.

Let’s suppose **the players use a natural focal point and play (A0, A0)**. Then you get **6**.

But if mixed strategy occurs, you get **2**.

But since (A0, A0) is a NE, and better, it might be chosen.

But is there a reason to expect (A1, A1)? Only if players are risk-averse or distrustful.

In real-world coordination games, (A0, A0) in symmetric games with dominant cooperative payoff often emerges as the **focal equilibrium**.

So under **C1**, **your expected payoff is likely 6**, **assuming coordination**.

But let’s not assume — let’s be conservative.

Suppose the **only possible outcome** is the equilibrium — but which one?

There are **two** pure NEs: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). So we need to know which is selected.

In symmetric games with one NE having higher payoff, and the other having equal but lower, players may coordinate on the high-payoff one.

In fact, **this is a coordination game** — like stag hunt.

So under C1, it’s **more likely** the outcome is (A0, A0), giving **6 points**, unless players distrust each other.

But since you are **Player 1**, and **you proposed C1**, it’s in your interest.

But now, **how many approvals does C1 get?**

You (P1) are pro-C1 — you **will approve it**.

What will Player 2 do?

Player 2 sees that under C1:
- If they play A0, they get +1 from P1
- If they play A1, they pay 1 to P1
- So they are **incentivized to play A0**

And in (A0, A0), they get 6, same as you.

So **Player 2 also benefits from coordinating on A0**.

So P2 has **no reason not to approve** C1.

In fact, P2 likely **also wants to approve it**.

So **C1 is likely to get 2 approvals** (both players).

So it will **win** with probability 1.

Then, you get **6 points** under C1.

Even if there’s a risk of (A1, A1), unless P2 is very distrustful, coordination on A0 is reasonable.

But to be safe: suppose P2 **also** is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff.

Under C1, if P2 plays A0, best response if P1 plays A0 → 6
If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 1
If P2 plays A1 → gets 2

So P2’s best response to P1’s A0: A0 (6) vs A1 (1) → A0
To P1’s A1: A0 (1) vs A1 (2) → A1

Same as before.

So again, mixed strategy at $ q = 0.2 $

Thus, **expected payoff under C1 is 2**

But wait: if they play mixed strategy, P1 gets 2.

But **if they both play A0**, P1 gets 6.

So what's the **most likely outcome**?

But in game theory, without coordination, players often play the **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

But in **this game**, **(A0, A0)** is a **strict** Nash equilibrium (deviating gives 2 < 6), while (A1, A1) gives 2 vs 2 (no gain from deviating), but if someone deviates unilaterally, gets 1 < 2 → so it’s a NE.

But (A0, A0) is **strict**, (A1, A1) is **weak**.

So **only (A0, A0)** is strict NE.

And in many frameworks, players are more likely to play strict NE.

Moreover, since (A0, A0) gives higher payoff and is strict, it’s the **focal point**.

Therefore: under C1, **players are likely to coordinate on (A0, A0)** → you get **6 points**.

Thus, C1 is **very favorable** to you.

So you should **approve C1**.

---

## **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So:
- If a player plays A0 → +5, paid by the other player
- If A1 → no transfer

So new payoff matrix (P1’s perspective):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 5 + 5 = 10, 5 + 5 = 10 | 0 + 5 = 5, 3 + 0 = 3 |
| A1     | 3 + 0 = 3, 0 + 5 = 5 | 3 + 0 = 3, 3 + 0 = 3 |

Wait:
- P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0: 
  - P1 gets 5 (base) + 5 (from A0) = 10
  - P2 gets 5 + 5 = 10
- P1 A0, P2 A1:
  - P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5
  - P2 gets 3 + 0 = 3 (since P2 played A1, no transfer)
- P1 A1, P2 A0:
  - P1 gets 3 + 0 = 3 (no transfer to P1)
  - P2 gets 0 + 5 = 5
- P1 A1, P2 A1:
  - Both get 3 (no transfer)

So payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 10, 10 | 5, 3 |
| A1     | 3, 5 | 3, 3 |

Now, analyze best responses.

For Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 → 10, A1 → 3 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant strategy for P1**

For Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 → 10, A1 → 3 → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant strategy for P2** as well

Thus, **(A0, A0)** is the **unique Nash equilibrium**, and in fact, **dominant strategy equilibrium**

So under C2, **both players will play A0** → outcome: (A0, A0)

You (Player 1) get: 10 points

That’s **much better** than the base game (3), and better than C1 (6)

So **C2 gives you 10 points** — the maximum possible.

Now, **would Player 2 approve C2?**

Player 2 proposed it — and under C2, they also get 10 points (if both play A0).

And since A0 is dominant, they will play A0 regardless.

So **Player 2 gets 10**, and has **no incentive not to approve** — it's in their best interest.

So C2 will likely be **approved by Player 2**, and **you** (Player 1) would want to **approve it** as well, since you get **10**.

So C2 is **very favorable** to **both**, and **leads to (A0, A0)** → **10 each**

So **you should approve C2**

But **why would you prefer C2 over C1?** Because you get **10** vs **6**

So **C2 is strictly better** for you.

---

### **Now, the key question: Can both contracts be approved?**

You can **approve both C1 and C2**.

But let’s see the approval mechanism:

> The winning contract will be selected **uniform at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**

So if you approve **both**, and Player 2 approves C2 (likely), and maybe C1 (maybe), then:

- If you approve C1 and C2
- Player 2 approves C2

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (only you)
- C2: 2 approvals (both)

So C2 has maximum approvals → **C2 wins** → you get 10

But if you **don’t approve C1**, and you approve C2:
- C1: 0 (you) + 1 (P2) → 1
- C2: 1 (you) + 1 (P2) → 2 → C2 wins → still 10

But what if Player 2 **does not approve C1**?

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (only you) → but if C2 is approved by both → C2 has 2 → wins
- So still C2 wins

But can you **get the benefit of C2** while also approving C1?

Yes — but **if both are approved**, C2 wins anyway.

But the **key insight** is: **C2 gives you 10, C1 gives you 6**

So **you should approve C2**

Should you **also approve C1?**

It’s not necessary.

But approving C1 doesn't hurt you (gives you less, but doesn’t reduce payoff), but may **increase risk**.

But since C2 wins anyway, it doesn’t matter.

But **is there a downside to approving C1?**

No — but **if Player 2 does not approve C1**, then C1 only has 1 approval (yours), while C2 has 2 → C2 wins.

If Player 2 **does** approve C1, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 2 → **randomly selects between C1 and C2**

Then you have **50% chance of getting 6**, **50% chance of getting 10**

So your **expected payoff** becomes:  
$ 0.5 × 6 + 0.5 × 10 = 3 + 5 = 8 $

Which is **less than 10**

So **if Player 2 approves both C1 and C2**, then C1 and C2 both have 2 approvals → random selection → your expected payoff drops from 10 to **8**

But if you **do not approve C1**, then:
- C1 has only 1 approval (from P2)
- C2 has 2 (if you and P2 approve)
- So C2 wins → you get 10

So by **not approving C1**, you **guarantee** getting 10.

By **approving C1**, you risk **randomization** between 6 and 10 → **expected 8** → worse.

Therefore: **you should NOT approve C1**, even though it gives you 6, because it **reduces your expected payoff** if P2 also approves it.

But **will P2 approve C1**?

C1 was proposed by **Player 1**, and it’s symmetric: if P2 plays A0, they get +1, A1 they pay -1.

So P2 benefits from (A0, A0), but only gets 6, while under C2, they get 10.

So **P2 has a strong incentive to prefer C2** over C1.

Moreover, since C2 leads to dominant strategy and 10, while C1 leads to 6, P2 is **less likely to approve C1**, unless they are indifferent.

But **C2 is strictly better for P2**, so **P2 will not approve C1**, unless they are very altruistic.

So **it’s highly likely that P2 will approve only C2**, not C1.

Thus, if you approve C1, C1 gets:
- 1 approval (from you)
- C2 gets 2 (you + P2)

So C2 wins → you get 10

So **approving C1 gives you no benefit, and only risks the possibility of random selection if P2 also approves C1**.

But since P2 has **no incentive** to approve C1 (because C2 gives higher payoff), it’s **safe** to assume **P2 will not approve C1**

Thus, **approving C1 does not harm you**, and doesn’t change the outcome.

But it doesn’t help either.

But since you want to **maximize your expected points**, and **approving C1 has no benefit**, **you should only approve C2**

But wait: **what if P2 approves C1 by mistake**, or out of spite? We assume rational players.

So **rational P2 will not approve C1**, because C2 is better for them.

Thus, **C1 will have at most 1 approval** (yours)

C2 will have 2 (you + P2)

So C2 wins.

Therefore, **you should approve C2**, and **not approve C1**

Because:
- Approving C1 adds no benefit
- Risk of randomization if P2 also approves C1 → expected payoff drops
- But P2 won’t approve C1 (since they get 10 under C2, only 6 under C1)

So **C1 will not be approved by P2**

Thus, **only C2 will have 2 approvals** → wins

So **you get 10**

Therefore: you should **approve C2**, **do not approve C1**

---

### **Final Decision**

- C1: **Do not approve** → because it's worse for you than C2, and may cause issues if P2 approves it, and P2 won’t approve it anyway.
- C2: **Approve** → gives you 10 points, and you can **guarantee** it wins.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

The base game is a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (for Player 1, row-wise; Player 2, column-wise) is:

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

We are Player 1.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria of the base game.

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1 gets 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A1

So no pure strategy equilibrium (it's not consistent). Let’s find the mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let Player 2 play A0 with probability *q*, A1 with probability *1−q*.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

Set equal for indifference:  
5q = 3 → q = 3/5

So Player 2 mixes A0 with 3/5, A1 with 2/5.

Similarly, by symmetry, Player 1 should play A0 with probability 3/5, A1 with 2/5.

At this equilibrium:
- Player 1’s expected payoff: 3 (from A1) or 5*(3/5) = 3 → yes, 3.
- So expected payoff is 3 points per round.

So in the base game, both players get 3 points in equilibrium.

But this is *before* contracts.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

There are two proposed contracts.

---

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Let’s interpret this.

Let’s suppose both players are playing the game and this contract is applied.

- If **you (Player 1)** play A0 → +1 point (from the contract),
  - But this +1 comes from the other player (Player 2), so Player 2 loses 1 point → this is **a transfer**.
- If **you play A1** → you pay 1 point (i.e., lose 1 point),
  - That 1 point goes to the other player (Player 2).

So this is a **direct transfer** based on action:
- A0 → +1 (from other player)
- A1 → −1 (to other player)

Note: The payment is "drawn equally from the other players" — since there’s only one other player, it's directly from them.

So, the **contract adds a transfer of 1 point from the player who chooses A1 to the player who chooses A0**, **or**:
- A0: +1 (from opponent)
- A1: −1 (to opponent)

So the net effect is: **each player pays 1 if they choose A1, gets 1 if they choose A0**.

This effectively **incentivizes choosing A0** over A1.

But it’s symmetric: same rule for both players.

So now, the **total payoff** becomes:

> Final payoff = Base payoff + Contract payment

Let’s revise the base payoff matrix to include **contract payments**.

Let’s define payoff for Player 1 under C1:

| P1 → | P2 ↓ | A0 | A1 |
|------|------|----|----|
| A0   | A0   | 5 +1 = 6 | 0 +1 = 1 |
|      | A1   | 0 −1 = −1 | 0 −1 = −1 |
| A1   | A0   | 3 +1 = 4 | 3 +1 = 4 |
|      | A1   | 3 −1 = 2 | 3 −1 = 2 |

Wait, let's be careful.

**Contruction:**
- If **you** choose A0 → +1
- If **you** choose A1 → −1

So **your contract payment depends only on your own action**, not the other player’s.

So yes, the contract adds:
- +1 to your payoff if you play A0,
- −1 if you play A1.

This is independent of the other player’s action.

So revised payoff matrix for **Player 1** under C1:

| P1 → | P2 ↓ | A0 | A1 |
|------|------|----|----|
| A0   | A0   | 5 +1 = 6 | 0 +1 = 1 |
| A0   | A1   | 0 +1 = 1 | 3 +1 = 4 |
| A1   | A0   | 3 −1 = 2 | 3 −1 = 2 |
| A1   | A1   | 3 −1 = 2 | 3 −1 = 2 |

Wait — no: the **contract payment** depends only on **your own action**, so:

- When P1 chooses A0 → +1 to P1
- When P1 chooses A1 → −1 to P1

So for each cell, P1's total payoff = base payoff + (1 if P1 played A0, −1 if A1)

So corrected table for **P1’s total payoff under C1**:

| P1 → | P2 ↓ | A0 | A1 |
|------|------|----|----|
| A0   | A0   | 5 + 1 = 6 | 0 + 1 = 1 |
| A0   | A1   | 0 + 1 = 1 | 3 + 1 = 4 |
| A1   | A0   | 3 − 1 = 2 | 3 − 1 = 2 |
| A1   | A1   | 3 − 1 = 2 | 3 − 1 = 2 |

Similarly for Player 2:
- If P2 plays A0 → +1
- If P2 plays A1 → −1

So same structure.

**Now, what happens to incentives under C1?**

Let’s analyze the **equilibrium** under C1.

For **Player 1**, suppose Player 2 chooses A0 with prob q, A1 with 1−q.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If A0: 6q + 1(1−q) = 6q + 1 − q = 5q + 1
- If A1: 2q + 2(1−q) = 2

Set equal for indifference:  
5q + 1 = 2 → 5q = 1 → q = 0.2

So Player 1 is indifferent only if P2 plays A0 with 20%, A1 with 80%.

But now consider Player 2’s incentives.

If P1 plays A0 with probability p, then Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If A0: 6p + 1(1−p) = 6p + 1 − p = 5p + 1
- If A1: 2p + 2(1−p) = 2

Set equal: 5p + 1 = 2 → p = 0.2

So symmetric: both players mix 20% A0, 80% A1.

Then Player 1’s expected payoff?

At equilibrium:
- (A0, A0): prob = 0.2×0.2 = 0.04 → P1 gets 6
- (A0, A1): 0.2×0.8 = 0.16 → P1 gets 1
- (A1, A0): 0.8×0.2 = 0.16 → P1 gets 2
- (A1, A1): 0.8×0.8 = 0.64 → P1 gets 2

Expected payoff for P1:
= 6×0.04 + 1×0.16 + 2×0.16 + 2×0.64  
= 0.24 + 0.16 + 0.32 + 1.28 = **1.00**

Wait: 0.24 + 0.16 = 0.4; +0.32 = 0.72; +1.28 = 2.00

Ah, 2.00 points for P1.

But wait: is that correct?

Let me compute again:
- (A0, A0): 6 × 0.04 = 0.24
- (A0, A1): 1 × 0.16 = 0.16
- (A1, A0): 2 × 0.16 = 0.32
- (A1, A1): 2 × 0.64 = 1.28

Sum: 0.24 + 0.16 = 0.4; 0.4 + 0.32 = 0.72; 0.72 + 1.28 = **2.00**

So Player 1 gets **2.00** points on average under C1 in equilibrium.

But wait — in the **base game** without contracts, Player 1 got **3** points.

So C1 *reduces* your expected payoff from 3 → 2?

But wait — **is that right?** Is this the only equilibrium?

Wait — let's recheck.

Actually, **if both players are identical and symmetric**, and C1 is symmetric, then symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium is plausible.

But in this case, without any reason to avoid A1, and since both players are paying 1 for A1, the base incentives are still strong — but now A0 has a bonus.

But in the base game, going from (A0, A0) → payoff 5, but here it's 6, so better.

But the problem is that **both players end up choosing A1 more**, because it's cheaper in terms of base payoff? Wait no.

Wait — in the base game, A0 gives 5, A1 gives 3 — so A0 is better. But in C1:
- A0 gets +1 → total 6 vs 3 → so A0 is even better
- A1 gets −1 → total 2 vs 3 → so A1 is worse

So **A0 is even more attractive**, A1 is worse.

So why are players choosing A1 80% of the time?

Wait — that seems inconsistent.

Wait — let’s recompute Player 1’s best response.

Suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with 1−q.

P1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 5q + 0(1−q) + 1 (from contract) = 5q + 1
- A1: 3q + 3(1−q) −1 = 3q + 3 −3q −1 = 2

So A0 gives: 5q + 1
A1 gives: 2

So A0 > A1 when 5q + 1 > 2 → 5q > 1 → q > 0.2

So:
- if q > 0.2 → P1 plays A0
- if q < 0.2 → P1 plays A1
- if q = 0.2 → indifferent

Similarly, Player 2’s best response to P1 playing A0 with p:
- P2’s payoff:
  - A0: 5p + 0(1−p) +1 = 5p +1
  - A1: 3p + 3(1−p) −1 = 3 −1 = 2
  - So same: A0 better if p > 0.2

So equilibrium is only when both play A0 with 0.2.

But at that point, both are indifferent.

So yes — equilibrium is p = q = 0.2.

But now: **is this equilibrium stable and better than base game?**

But in this equilibrium, **P1’s expected payoff is only 2**, while in the base game, it was 3.

So **C1 reduces your payoff**?

Wait — is that possible? Why?

Because although C1 gives a bonus to A0, it also charges a penalty to A1 — but the problem is that **both players start gaining more from A0**, so they are actually incentivized to coordinate on A0.

But due to asymmetric incentives, **the equilibrium ends up having both players playing A1 most of the time**, which is bad for everyone.

But why don't they play A0 all the time?

Because if P2 plays A0 with high probability, P1 prefers A0.

But if P1 plays A0 with high probability, P2 also prefers A0.

So **why is equilibrium at 20%?**

Wait — **this is incorrect**.

Wait — in the payoff table, when P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 6, P2 gets 6.

But if P1 plays A0, P2’s best response: if P1 plays A0 with p, P2's expected payoff from A0: 6p + 1(1−p) = 5p + 1? Wait no.

Wait — earlier we said:
- If P2 plays A0 → P2 gets 5p + 0(1−p) +1 = 5p +1
- If P2 plays A1 → 3p + 3(1−p) −1 = 3 −1 = 2

So yes — A0 better if 5p +1 > 2 → 5p > 1 → p > 0.2

So if p > 0.2, P2 wants A0.

At p = 0.2, indifferent.

But suppose p = 1 (P1 always plays A0). Then P2’s best response:
- A0: 5(1) +1 = 6
- A1: 2 → so prefers A0

So P2 plays A0.

Then P1, seeing P2 plays A0, should play A0 → payoff 6

So (A0, A0) is a **strict Nash equilibrium** under C1?

Wait! This is a key insight.

Let’s test (A0, A0) in C1:

- P1: plays A0 → gets 5 (base) +1 (contract) = 6
- If P1 deviates to A1: gets 0 (base) −1 (contract) = −1 < 6 → no incentive to deviate

Similarly, P2 gets 6, if deviates to A1: gets 3 −1 = 2 < 6

So **(A0, A0)** is a strict Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, is (A1, A1) an equilibrium?

- P1: plays A1 → gets 3 (base) −1 (contract) = 2
- Deviate to A0: gets 0 +1 = 1 < 2 → no incentive

So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium: neither wants to deviate.

Now, (A0, A1):
- P1: gets 0 +1 = 1
- P2: gets 3 +1 = 4
- P1: if deviates to A1, gets 3 −1 = 2 > 1 → so would deviate
So not equilibrium.

(A1, A0): P1 gets 3 −1 = 2, P2 gets 0 +1 = 1
P2: if deviates to A1, gets 3 −1 = 2 > 1 → so deviates → not equilibrium.

So **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

In C1, the players can coordinate on (A0, A0), which gives both 6 points — **better than base game's 5**.

They could also be stuck in (A1, A1), getting 2 each — worse.

But under **rational coordination**, players would **cooperate to play (A0, A0)**, since it's a mutual best response and gives higher payoff.

But in the absence of communication, it may not happen.

However, **in this decision-making game**, players are choosing probabilities simultaneously, but **they can approve contracts**.

And **the winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So if we **approve** a contract, we’re trying to increase its chance of being selected.

Now, **what is the equilibrium outcome?**

But the **key point** is: **in C1, the players can achieve (A0, A0) as a Nash equilibrium**, which gives **6 points** — **better** than base game’s 5.

But it’s not guaranteed — could get (A1, A1) with only 2.

But **if players are rational and expect coordination**, they’ll likely go to (A0, A0).

In fact, since (A0, A0) is a **strict Nash equilibrium**, it’s a focal point.

So C1 **enables a much better outcome** than the base game.

Moreover, **if both players approve C1**, it will be selected with some probability (though not guaranteed, since we’re selecting uniform at random among most-approved contracts).

But now, let’s look at C2.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So:
- A0 → +4 (from other player)
- A1 → 0 additional payment

This is **not symmetric**: benefits A0, but no cost for A1.

So if you play A0, you get +4 from opponent.
If you play A1, no transfer — but no penalty either.

So revised payoff for **Player 1** under C2:

| P1 → | P2 ↓ | A0 | A1 |
|------|------|----|----|
| A0   | A0   | 5 +4 = 9 | 0 +4 = 4 |
| A0   | A1   | 0 +4 = 4 | 3 +4 = 7 |
| A1   | A0   | 3 +0 = 3 | 3 +0 = 3 |
| A1   | A1   | 3 +0 = 3 | 3 +0 = 3 |

Wait — no: **the +4 is "drawn equally from the other players"** — so only applies **if you choose A0**, and the **cost is borne by the other player**, but only when *you* choose A0.

So if **you** play A0 → you get +4 (from the other player)
If you play A1 → you get 0 extra — no cost, no benefit.

So for P1:
- A0 → +4 if P1 chooses A0
- A1 → 0

So the table is:

| P1 → | P2 ↓ | A0 | A1 |
|------|------|----|----|
| A0   | A0   | 5 + 4 = 9 | 0 + 4 = 4 |
| A0   | A1   | 0 + 4 = 4 | 3 + 4 = 7 |
| A1   | A0   | 3 + 0 = 3 | 3 + 0 = 3 |
| A1   | A1   | 3 + 0 = 3 | 3 + 0 = 3 |

Now, let’s analyze incentives.

Suppose P2 plays A0 with probability q.

P1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 9q + 4(1−q) = 9q + 4 − 4q = 5q + 4
- A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

Compare:
5q + 4 > 3 → always true for q ≥ 0, since 5q + 4 ≥ 4 > 3

So **P1 always prefers A0**, no matter what P2 does.

Similarly, for Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0 with p, P2’s payoff:
  - A0: 9p + 4(1−p) = 5p + 4
  - A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3
  - So A0 > A1 always
So **both players always have incentive to play A0**, regardless of the other's action.

So **the only Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)** — pure strategy.

And in that case, **P1 gets 9 points**, P2 gets 9 points.

This is **much better** than base game (5), and also better than C1's 6.

**But is that fair?**

Wait — in C2, if P1 plays A0, P2 must pay 4 to P1.

So if **both play A0**, P1 gets 5 + 4 = 9, P2 gets 5 − 4 = 1? Wait — **no!**

**Mistake here.**

Crucial point:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you** play A0, **you get 4 points**, taken from the **other player**.

So in (A0, A0):
- P1 plays A0 → receives 4 from P2
- P2 plays A0 → receives 4 from P1

So **transfer of 4 from P1 to P2**, and 4 from P2 to P1.

So **net zero**?

Wait — **not necessarily**.

But is **each player drawing 4 from the other**?

Yes — **"drawn equally from the other players"**.

There is only one other player.

So when P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 4 from P2.

When P2 plays A0 → P2 gets 4 from P1.

So in (A0, A0): P1 gains 4 from P2, and loses 4 to P2 → **net zero**.

Similarly, P2 gains 4 from P1, loses 4 to P1 → net zero.

So contract payment is **only applied based on your action**.

So yes, in (A0, A0): both get +4 from the other player, so net +4 − 4 = 0? No — **no.**

Wait — each player **only receives payment when they choose A0**.

But if both choose A0, then:
- P1 receives +4 (from P2)
- P1 also has to **pay** 4 to P2? No — only if P1 is the one receiving.

Wait — **the payment is defined as: "receive an additional payment of 4 if you choose A0" — drawn from other player(s)**.

So **P1 receives 4** from P2 **if P1 chooses A0**, regardless of what P2 does.

**P2 receives 4 from P1 if P2 chooses A0.**

So in (A0, A0):
- P1: gets 4 from P2 → +4
- P2: gets 4 from P1 → +4
- So both receive +4 from other player.

**No payment is made by one to the other unless the other is also playing A0** — but **everyone receives**.

So **in (A0, A0)**:
- P1 gets +4 from P2 (because P1 played A0)
- P2 gets +4 from P1 (because P2 played A0)

So both are **awarded +4**, no cost.

But where does the money come from?

It must **come from the other player(s)** — so P2 is losing 4 to P1, and P1 is losing 4 to P2.

So **net transfer**: P1 loses 4 to P2, gains 4 from P2 → net zero.

Similarly for P2.

So **the contract payments are symmetric and cancel out** — **net zero transfer** in (A0, A0).

But wait — **is this possible?**

The contract says: "if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4, drawn equally from the other players."

So for each player:
- if they choose A0 → they get 4
- that 4 comes from other players (i.e., is taken from the other player's pocket)

So in (A0, A0):
- P1 gets 4 (from P2)
- P2 gets 4 (from P1)

So P1’s account: +4 from P2
P2’s account: +4 from P1

But **P1’s money is coming from P2**, and P2’s from P1.

So if **both** play A0, **each receives 4 from the other**, so **net effect: each gets +4**, but **where is the money from?**

It must come from the **total pool**.

But the specification is "drawn equally from the other players".

In a two-player game, when P1 plays A0, P1 gets 4, **taken from P2**.

When P2 plays A0, P2 gets 4, **taken from P1**.

So in (A0, A0):
- P1 receives 4 from P2 → P2 loses 4
- P2 receives 4 from P1 → P1 loses 4
- So net: P1: +4 −4 = 0
- P2: +4 −4 = 0

So **the net payment is zero**.

But then why is this a payment? It's **a transfer that cancels**.

But wait — no: the **payment is made separately**.

So **P1’s total contract payment** = +4 (from P2) if P1 plays A0 → but P1 **also pays** 4 to P2 if P2 plays A0.

But **only the receiving part is tied to the player's own action**.

But the **source** is the other player.

So **P1’s contract income** = 4 if P1 plays A0
But P1 **does not pay anything unless P2 plays A0** — but that’s not described.

Wait — the description says: **"receive an additional payment of 4 if you choose A0, drawn from the other players"**.

It **does not say** you pay anything when the other plays A0.

So the **payment is unilateral**.

So:
- If you play A0 → you **receive** 4 from the other player
- If you play A1 → you get nothing, pay nothing

So in (A0, A0):
- P1 plays A0 → gets 4 from P2
- P2 plays A0 → gets 4 from P1

So **P1 receives 4** from P2
**P2 receives 4** from P1

So **both are net positive** — their **money** is being transferred in both directions.

But **in reality**, the money has to come from somewhere.

But in game theory, we often model this as **pure transfers**.

So **P1’s total contract payment: +4**
**P2’s total contract payment: +4**

But there’s **no sender or receiver** — it’s like a **free lunch**?

But that can’t be — unless the game is funded.

But the **contract** is a **transfer rule**, not a gift.

But by definition: when P1 plays A0, he **gets 4, which is taken from P2**.

When P2 plays A0, he **gets 4, which is taken from P1**.

So **P1’s money**: he gains 4 from P2, loses 4 to P2 → net zero

Similarly for P2.

So the **net transfer is zero**, but **each player gets +4 in the contract**?

No — if P1 gets +4 (from P2), and also **loses 4 to P2**, then net = 0.

But the **problem is**: the **payment is only based on your action**, not on others'.

So if P1 plays A0 → P1 gains 4 (from P2)
But if P2 plays A0 → P2 gains 4 (from P1)

But **P1 is not required to pay anything unless P2 plays A0**? But that's **not stated**.

Actually, the **contract does not say you pay when others play A0** — it only says:
- If **you** play A0 → you receive 4 (from others)
- If **you** play A1 → no additional payments

So **regardless of what the other does**, if **you** play A0, **you get 4** — taken from the other players.

But if **you** play A1, **you get nothing**.

So in (A0, A0):
- P1 gets 4 from P2 (because P1 chose A0)
- P2 gets 4 from P1 (because P2 chose A0)
- So **P1’s net contract payment: +4**
- P2’s net contract payment: +4

But **how** are both getting +4 without a loss?

The only way this is consistent is if the total "money" is increased by 8 (4+4), or if it's a **pool**.

But the description says "drawn from the other players" — so it must come from them.

But if P1’s +4 comes from P2, that implies P2 loses 4.

But P2’s +4 must come from P1 — so P1 loses 4.

So P1: +4 (from P2) −4 (to P2) = 0

Similarly for P2.

So **net contract payment: zero** for both.

But that contradicts the spirit of the contract.

Ah — **the resolution**:

The payment is **not** that you get +4 when you play A0 and pay 4 when the other plays A0.

Rather, the **only thing that matters** is: **if you choose A0, you get 4 from the other players**.

But **it doesn't say you lose money if you play A1** — and it doesn't say you can't get a payment.

But in **multiple players**, if both play A0, then:
- Each player **receives 4 from the other** — so each gets +4
- But to give 4, each must have the money to give

So in **a two-player game**, when both choose A0:
- P1 gets 4 from P2
- P2 gets 4 from P1
- So P1: gains 4, loses 4 → net 0
- P2: gains 4, loses 4 → net 0

So effectively, **the contract has no effect on net wealth** in (A0, A0) — but both **appear** to gain.

But in **expectation**:

- In (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets 4 from P2
  - P2 plays A1 → gets 0
  - So P2 loses 4 to P1

Similarly, in (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → gets 0
- P2 plays A0 → gets 4 from P1
- So P1 loses 4

In (A1, A1): both get 0

So the **contract allocates 4 points from the "loser" to the "winner" in A0**, but in (A0, A0), the payments cancel.

But the **base payouts** are separate.

So let’s recalculate P1’s **total payoff** under C2:

- (A0, A0): base payoff 5 + contract: +4 (from P2) = **9**
- (A0, A1): base 0 + contract: +4 (from P2) = **4**
- (A1, A0): base 3 + contract: 0 (P1 played A1) = **3**
- (A1, A1): base 3 + contract: 0 = **3**

But in (A0, A0): P1 gets +4 from P2, but also P2 gets +4 from P1.

But since those are **what the contract says**, we still add +4 to P1’s total in (A0, A0) — even though it’s paid by P2.

So in game theory, we **do** include it.

So yes, in (A0, A0): P1 gets 5 + 4 = 9

Similarly for P2: 5 + 4 = 9

And the money comes from... well, it's a transfer rule.

So **gross, both get +4 in contract**, but the system is closed.

But for **payoff calculation**, we include it.

So the table is correct.

Back to P1's incentives under C2:

P1’s payoff:
- A0: if P2 plays A0 → 9, if P2 plays A1 → 4
- A1: if P2 plays A0 → 3, if P2 plays A1 → 3

So **a1** yields 3 no matter what.

**a0** yields at least 4 (if P2 plays A1), and 9 if P2 plays A0.

So since 4 > 3, **P1 always prefers A0**.

Similarly for P2.

So the only Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0), and **P1 gets 9 points**.

That’s **very good**.

In contrast, under C1, we could get (A0, A0) with 6 points — still better than base.

But here, **C2 gives 9 points** under equilibrium.

But who proposed it? **Player 2**.

Can Player 1 approve it?

Player 1 wants to **maximize their points**.

If C2 is approved, and is selected, then playing with C2 gives **Player 1 9 points**.

Under C1, if selected, best they can get is 6 (if they coordinate on A0), but there’s a risk of getting 2.

But C2 **forces coordination on A0**, and gives **9 points**.

So **C2 is better for Player 1**.

But is there a catch?

In C2, **both players get 9** if they play (A0, A0), which is the only equilibrium.

Even if P2 is foolish, P1 is **forced to play A0** because A0 always gives more than A1.

So **P1 is guaranteed to get at least 4** (in (A0, A1)) or 9 (in (A0, A0)), and **can never get less than 3** (which is what A1 gives).

Minimum under C2: if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 9 if A0, 3 if A1 — so best to play A0.

If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4 if A0, 3 if A1 — still prefers A0.

So **P1 always gets at least 4 under C2**, and often 9.

**Under C1**, in the mixed equilibrium, they get only 2 — but if they coordinate, they get 6.

But C1 has **lower guaranteed payoff**.

Moreover, **C2 is better**.

But wait — **who proposed it?** Player 2.

But Player 1 can approve C2.

Now, **what if both contracts are approved?**

Then both C1 and C2 are in the running.

The winning contract is selected **uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

Suppose you approve C2, and **Player 2 approves C1** (since it's proposed by them).

Then:
- C1: number of approvals = 1 (Player 2)
- C2: number of approvals = 1 (you)

So both have same approval count, so both are in the running.

Then winning contract is chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance C1, 50% C2.

Then your expected payoff:
- 0.5 × (payoff under C1) + 0.5 × (payoff under C2)

But **C1's payoff depends on the players' behavior**, and is not guaranteed.

Under C1, **you can get 6 if you coordinate**, or 2 if not.

But if you approve C2, and C2 is selected, you get **9**.

But if C1 is selected, you might get only 2 in equilibrium.

But you can **influence behavior** — but due to ambiguity, we have to assume **rational best response**.

Under C1, best outcome is 6, worst is 2.

But **is there a focal point? Yes, (A0, A0)**.

In fact, since it's a strict Nash equilibrium, **and gives higher payoff**, rational players would likely **coordinate on it**.

Similarly, C2 forces it.

So **in both cases, players will coordinate on (A0, A0)**.

So under C1, you get 6 points.
Under C2, you get 9 points.

So if both are approved, expected payoff: 0.5×6 + 0.5×9 = 3 + 4.5 = 7.5

If only C1 is approved, you get 6.

If only C2 is approved, you get 9.

So **best to approve C2**.

But what if you approve **only C2**, and C1 is not approved?

Then C2 has 1 approval, C1 has 1 or 0, so C2 wins → you get 9.

But what if C1 is also approved by others?

But we don’t know.

But since **we are the only player with no info**, we should maximize **minimum expected payoff** or **expected payoff under rational equilibrium**.

But **C2 always gives higher player payoff**.

**Gradient of applicability**: C2 guarantees coordination on (A0, A0) with certainty, while C1 does not (risk of coordination failure).

So C2 is **superior**.

Moreover, **C2 is more desirable for Player 1** because it gives **9 points**.

Now, **C1 gives only 6 or 2**, and has a risk.

So **Player 1 should approve C2**.

But **should you approve C1?**

If you approve C1, and C1 wins, you get 6.

But if C2 is also approved, then you might get 7.5.

But if you **don’t approve C1**, then C1 can only win if others approve it.

But currently, **only Player 2 proposes C1**, so if you don’t approve, C1 has only 1 approval.

C2, if you approve, has at least 1.

So **if you approve C2, and not C1**, C2 is more likely to win.

So **approval of C1 gives no benefit**, and may push C2 out.

But **C1 is worse for you**.

So **do not approve C1**.

But **C2 is better**, so **approve C2**.

But wait — **is C2 fair?** Yes, but Player 1 benefits.

So final decision:

- Approve C2: **YES**
- Approve C1: **NO**

But let’s confirm: does C2 require approval? Yes.

And you are Player 1.

So output:

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

But wait — **the contract "C1" is proposed by Player 1, so it’s temptation — but it’s bad for you**.

So **reject it**.

Final answer:

```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}
```

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step, taking into account the original payoffs, the structure of the game, the contract mechanism, and the incentives involved.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game where:
- You (Player 2) and the other player (Player 1) each choose A0 or A1 with some probability.
- Payoffs are:

| Your Choice | Opponent's Choice | Your Payoff | Opponent's Payoff |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 5           | 5                 |
| A0          | A1                | 0           | 3                 |
| A1          | A0                | 3           | 0                 |
| A1          | A1                | 3           | 3                 |

This is a classic coordination game with a mixed equilibrium.

Let’s find the **Nash equilibrium** of the base game.

Assume:
- You (Player 2) play A0 with probability `p`
- Player 1 (the other player) plays A0 with probability `q`

**Your expected payoff:**

- If you play A0:  
  E[A0] = q×5 + (1−q)×0 = 5q
- If you play A1:  
  E[A1] = q×3 + (1−q)×3 = 3

You are indifferent between A0 and A1 when:
5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

**Similarly, for Player 1:**
- If Player 1 plays A0: E = p×5 + (1−p)×0 = 5p
- If Player 1 plays A1: E = p×3 + (1−p)×3 = 3
- Indifference: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So the unique **symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** is:
- Both players choose A0 with probability 0.6
- Both choose A1 with probability 0.4

**Expected payoff for you in equilibrium:**
- From A0: 5×0.6 = 3.0
- From A1: 3.0
- But since you mix, your expected payoff is 3.0 regardless.

So, **your expected payoff in the base game equilibrium is 3 points.**

But note: **You can do better if you can coordinate or change incentives via contracts.**

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

- A contract specifies **additional payments** based on your action.
- These payments are **drawn equally from the other player** — i.e., if you get +1 for choosing A0, your opponent loses 1 for that event (shared equally, but since only one other player, it’s fully from them).
- Contracts are proposed and voted on via **approval voting**.
- The **winning contract** is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

But **the contract must be approved by both players** to be adopted — or at least, both must approve it?

Wait: the prompt says:
> "a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process."

"Agree" implies **both players must approve** — otherwise, it doesn’t go through.

But the question says:
> "return which contracts you approve", and the winning contract is selected from those with **maximum number of approvals**.

So **it's possible** that:
- Only one player approves a contract
- But if both do, it's more likely to win

But in the **approval voting** system described, **a contract wins if it has the maximum number of approvals**, and **among such contracts, it is selected uniformly at random**.

So **you want to approve contracts that you believe will either:**
1. Increase your expected payoff (if adopted), or
2. Help coordinate on better outcomes (e.g., both A0, which gives 5 points), or
3. Be approved by others (if both approve, it has 2 approvals, likely to win)

But the key is: **you care about your own points, so you will only want a contract that is either:
- Definitely beneficial for you (increases your expected payoff), or
- Has a high chance of being selected and improving your outcome**

But since only one contract is actually used (selected at random from max approval contracts), and you are maximizing **your total points**, you must evaluate: **Which contracts, if implemented, would give you higher expected payoff?**

And since you can **only approve or disapprove**, and **you can't force a contract to pass**, you must decide: **Which contracts would you prefer to be adopted, considering your incentives?**

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Each Contract**

There are two proposed contracts:

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
- If you choose A0 → receive **+1 bonus**, paid **equally from the other player** → so your opponent pays you 1.
- A1 → no additional payments.

**So:**
- If you choose A0, you get +1 from the contract (net gain for you, cost to opponent).
- If you choose A1, nothing changes.

So this contract **subsidizes A0** for both players — but only if they choose it.

Let’s recompute the total payoffs **including the contract**:

New payoffs:

| Your Choice | Opponent's Choice | Base Your Payoff | Contract Bonus (You) | Contract Cost (You) | Total You | Opponent Total |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------|----------------|
| A0          | A0                | 5                 | +1 (from choice A0)    | -1 (you pay opponent when opponent chooses A0) → but wait!

Wait: **"drawn equally from the other players"** → so the bonus is **financed by the other player**.

So:
- When you choose A0, you get +1, and your opponent **loses 1** (if they are the other player).
- When you choose A1, no bonus, no cost.

So the total payoff for Player 2 (you) becomes:

| Your A | Opponent A | Base Payoff (You) | Contract Bonus (You) | Final Payoff (You) | Opponent Final Payoff |
|--------|------------|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| A0     | A0         | 5                  | +1                       | **6**                  | 5 - 1 = 4              |
| A0     | A1         | 0                  | +1                       | **1**                  | 3                      |
| A1     | A0         | 3                  | 0                        | **3**                  | 0 - 1 = -1             |
| A1     | A1         | 3                  | 0                        | **3**                  | 3                      |

Note: The contract cost is **only when the other player chooses A0**? Wait no — the contract is **on your choice**. The bonus is paid **when you choose A0**, and the **total cost is drawn from the other player**.

But **how is the cost shared**? “drawn equally from the other players” — but only one other player → so full cost is from them.

So:
- Whenever **you choose A0**, you get +1, and **opponent pays you 1**.
- Whenever **you choose A1**, nothing changes.

So yes, the **cost is incurred by the opponent only when you choose A0**.

So the opponent loses 1 **when you choose A0**, regardless of what they choose.

Important: the bonus is paid **only based on your action**, not on joint actions.

So your final payoff when you choose A0 is:
- Base payoff + 1
- Opponent pays you 1 → so their payoff is reduced by 1

**But**: if the opponent also chooses A0, then they also get a bonus? Yes — but only **if they choose A0**, so they are paid **when they choose A0**, and **you pay them when *you* choose A0**.

So the **total effect is symmetric**: whenever a player chooses A0, they gain +1, and the other loses 1.

So **both** players get +1 if they choose A0, and the other person loses 1 **only if they choose A0**.

So in the A0 vs A0 case:
- You: base 5 +1 = 6
- Opponent: base 5 +1 = 6, but you chose A0 → opponent loses 1 → 6 -1 = 5

Wait — this is a **contradiction**.

Let's parse carefully:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- **You** choose A0 → you get +1 → the other player pays it (since "drawn from others").
- Opponent chooses A0 → opponent gets +1 → you pay it.

So the cost is **directly tied to your choice**.

So the **net effect per cell** is:

| Your A | Opp A | You's Base | You's Bonus (A0) | You's Cost (if Opp A0) | You's Total | Opp Total |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------|------------|
| A0     | A0    | 5          | +1                | -1 (because opp chose A0) | 5 +1 -1 = 5  | 5 +1 -1 = 5 |
| A0     | A1    | 0          | +1                | 0 (opp chose A1, so no cost) | 0+1 = 1 | 3 +0 -1 = 2 |
| A1     | A0    | 3          | 0                 | -1 (opp chose A0) | 3 +0 -1 = 2 | 0 +1 -0 = 1 |
| A1     | A1    | 3          | 0                 | 0 | 3 | 3 +0 -0 = 3 |

Wait — that doesn’t look right. If opponent chooses A0, **you pay them** only because **you** (Player 2) chose A0? No.

No: **the bonus is paid to the player who chooses A0**, and **it is paid by the other player(s)**.

So:
- When **you choose A0**, you get +1, and **you are paid by the other player** → so **opponent pays you**.
- When **opponent chooses A0**, opponent gets +1, and **you (as the other player) pay them**.

Therefore, **both actions are independent**.

So:

- If you choose A0 → you gain +1 and opponent loses 1 (because you are paid by them)
- If opponent chooses A0 → opponent gain +1 and you lose 1 (because you pay them)

So **these are both true simultaneously** when both choose A0.

So for **A0 vs A0**:
- You: base 5 +1 (bonus) -1 (cost, because opponent chose A0) = 5
- Opponent: base 5 +1 (bonus) -1 (cost, because you chose A0) = 5

Wait — so net: both get 5? But base was 5, and both get +1 and lose -1 → net 5.

But that seems symmetric.

Let’s recompute all cases carefully:

### Contract C1: A0 → +1 bonus paid by other player

| Your A | Opp A | Your Base | Your Bonus | Your Cost (vs Opp A0) | Your Total | Opp Base | Opp Bonus | Opp Cost (vs Your A0) | Opp Total |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------|------------------------|-------------|----------|------------|------------------------|------------|
| A0     | A0     | 5         | +1         | -1                     | 5           | 5        | +1         | -1                     | 5          |
| A0     | A1     | 0         | +1         | 0                      | **1**       | 3        | 0          | -1                     | 2          |
| A1     | A0     | 3         | 0          | -1                     | **2**       | 0        | +1         | 0                      | 1          |
| A1     | A1     | 3         | 0          | 0                      | **3**       | 3        | 0          | 0                      | 3          |

Wait: in A1 vs A0:
- You chose A1 → no bonus.
- Opp chose A0 → so they get +1.
- But you paid them because you are the other player? Yes.

So you pay them → you lose 1.

So you: 3 -1 = 2 → correct.

Opp: 0 +1 = 1 → and no cost (because you didn't choose A0), so 1.

Similarly, A0 vs A1:
- You: base 0 +1 (for your A0) → 1
- Opp: base 3, and you chose A0, so they pay you → but **you didn't choose A0**, so they don't get paid by you? Wait.

Wait: opponent chose A1 → so they get no bonus.
But **you chose A0** → so they owe you 1 → so you get +1, opponent loses 1.

So:
- Opp: 3 -1 = 2
- You: 0 +1 = 1

Yes.

So the new payoff table under **C1** (Player 1's contract) is:

| Your A | Opp A | Your Total | Opp Total |
|--------|--------|------------|-----------|
| A0     | A0     | 5          | 5         |
| A0     | A1     | 1          | 2         |
| A1     | A0     | 2          | 1         |
| A1     | A1     | 3          | 3         |

Now compare with original:

Original:
- A0 vs A0: 5 vs 5 → same
- A0 vs A1: 0 vs 3 → now 1 vs 2 (you better off)
- A1 vs A0: 3 vs 0 → now 2 vs 1 (you worse off? Now you get 2, previously 3 — **worse**)
- A1 vs A1: 3 vs 3 → same

So **your payoff**:
- A0 vs A0: 5 → same
- A0 vs A1: 1 → better than 0
- A1 vs A0: 2 → worse than 3
- A1 vs A1: 3 → same

So for **you**, A0 is less attractive **if opponent plays A0**, because:
- If opponent plays A0, your best response?
  - If opp plays A0, your choice:
    - A0 → 5
    - A1 → 2 → so A0 better
- If opponent plays A1:
  - You: A0 → 1, A1 → 3 → so A1 better

So your best response is to **match** the opponent's action.

But is there a coordination equilibrium?

Let’s check for NE.

Let p = your prob of A0
q = opp prob of A0

Your expected payoff:

- E[A0] = q×5 + (1−q)×1 = 5q + 1 - q = 4q + 1
- E[A1] = q×2 + (1−q)×3 = 2q + 3 - 3q = 3 - q

Set equal: 4q + 1 = 3 - q → 5q = 2 → q = 0.4

So you are indifferent if q = 0.4

Similarly, for opponent:

- Opp payoff:
  - A0: 5q + 2(1−q) = 5q + 2 - 2q = 3q + 2
  - A1: 1q + 3(1−q) = q + 3 - 3q = 3 - 2q

Set equal: 3q + 2 = 3 - 2q → 5q = 1 → q = 0.2

So opponent's best response is different.

But this is messy. Instead, let's think about **your interest in this contract**.

### Do you prefer C1?

Under C1:
- If both play A0: you get 5 → same as before
- If both play A1: 3 → same
- But if mismatch happens:
  - You play A0, opp A1: you get 1 → better than 0
  - You play A1, opp A0: you get 2 → worse than 3

So you **gain when you’re mistaken**, but **lose when opponent is mistaken**.

But since you're more likely to **deviate** from A1, and you have an incentive to coordinate on A0?

Wait: under C1, the **payoff for A0 depends on what opponent does**.

But **A0 is incentivized by the bonus**, but only if you choose it.

But your payoff from A0 is **higher when opponent plays A1**, but lower when opponent plays A0? No: A0 gives **5 vs opponent A0**, and **1 vs opponent A1**.

So **A0 is only good if opponent plays A1?** No: 5 > 1, so A0 is always better than A1 **if opponent plays A0**.

But if opponent plays A1, **A1 is better (3 > 1)**.

So your best response depends on opp.

But now, under C1, **A0 is subsidized**, so **incentive to play A0 increases**.

But let’s look at **Contract C2** (Proposed by Player 2):

### Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2 – i.e., by you):

- If you choose A0 → you get **+2 bonus**, paid by other player
- A1 → no bonus

So you get +2 **if you choose A0**, and **opponent pays you 2**.

So your final payoffs:

| Your A | Opp A | Your Base | Your Bonus | Your Cost (if opp A0) | Your Total | Opp Total |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------|------------------------|-------------|------------|
| A0     | A0     | 5         | +2         | -2                     | 5 +2 -2 = 5 | 5 +0 -2 = 3 |
| A0     | A1     | 0         | +2         | 0                      | 0+2 = 2     | 3 +0 -2 = 1 |
| A1     | A0     | 3         | 0          | -2                     | 3 +0 -2 = 1 | 0 +2 -0 = 2 |
| A1     | A1     | 3         | 0          | 0                      | 3           | 3 +0 -0 = 3 |

So payoff table:

| Your A | Opp A | Your Total | Opp Total |
|--------|--------|------------|-----------|
| A0     | A0     | 5          | 3         |
| A0     | A1     | 2          | 1         |
| A1     | A0     | 1          | 2         |
| A1     | A1     | 3          | 3         |

Compare to original:
- A0 vs A0: 5 → same
- A0 vs A1: 2 → better than 0
- A1 vs A0: 1 → **worse than 3**
- A1 vs A1: 3 → same

Now, for you:
- If opp plays A0:
  - A0: 5 (better than A1: 1)
  - So you prefer A0
- If opp plays A1:
  - A0: 2
  - A1: 3 → so you prefer A1

So again, you best respond to opponent.

But note: your payoff from A0 is **only 2 vs A1**, and **lower than 3**, so if you think opp is likely to play A1, you prefer A1.

But **the cost of choosing A0 is higher** in C2: -2 cost if opponent plays A0.

So both contracts make A0 more attractive (you get a bonus), but **you pay more when opponent plays A0**.

In C1: cost is -1 when opp plays A0
In C2: cost is -2 when opp plays A0

So **C2 is worse for you in coordination failures**, because you pay more.

But **C2 gives you a larger bonus** (2 vs 1).

So which contract is better for you?

Let’s compute expected payoff under **equilibrium under each contract**, and see which one gives you higher expected payoff.

But we also need to think: **if the contract passes, which equilibrium do you get?**

But since both players are rational and strategic, they will play a Nash equilibrium.

---

### **Step 4: Best Response and Equilibrium Analysis Under Contracts**

We’ll compute **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**, assuming both players are symmetric (though contracts may break symmetry).

But you are **Player 2**, and **C2 is proposed by you**, so you may want to **make sure it’s favorable**.

But since the contract is **only adopted if approved**, and you can **only approve it if it benefits you**, we need to compare.

Let’s analyze under **C1** and **C2** separately.

---

#### **Analysis of C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

Payoffs (you as player 2):

| Your A | Opp A | Your Payoff |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| A0     | A0     | 5           |
| A0     | A1     | 1           |
| A1     | A0     | 2           |
| A1     | A1     | 3           |

Let p = your prob A0
q = opp prob A0

E[you choose A0] = 5q + 1(1−q) = 4q + 1  
E[you choose A1] = 2q + 3(1−q) = 2q + 3 - 3q = 3 - q

Set equal:  
4q + 1 = 3 - q → 5q = 2 → q = 0.4

Similarly, for opponent:

E[opponent A0] = 5p + 2(1−p) = 5p + 2 - 2p = 3p + 2  
E[opponent A1] = 1p + 3(1−p) = p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 2p

Set equal:  
3p + 2 = 3 - 2p → 5p = 1 → p = 0.2

So in equilibrium: **you play A0 with prob 0.2**, **opponent plays A0 with prob 0.4**

Your expected payoff:
- (0.2)(0.4)(5) + (0.2)(0.6)(1) + (0.8)(0.4)(2) + (0.8)(0.6)(3)
= (0.08)(5) + (0.12)(1) + (0.32)(2) + (0.48)(3)
= 0.4 + 0.12 + 0.64 + 1.44
= **2.6**

But wait — this is **lower than base game’s 3**?

In base game we had 3.

So under C1, your expected payoff is **2.6**, which is worse.

But **you can do better if you coordinate on A0**.

But in equilibrium, you play A0 only 20% of the time.

So C1 is **bad for you**.

But why?

Because C1 makes A0 more costly to play if opponent plays A0 (you pay 1), so you are discouraged from playing A0.

But you only get +1 bonus.

So net, you **don't want to play A0**.

So equilibria are low A0.

So **you are worse off under C1**.

So **you should disapprove C1**.

---

#### **Analysis of C2 (Proposed by You)**

Your payoff table:

| Your A | Opp A | Your Payoff |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| A0     | A0     | 5           |
| A0     | A1     | 2           |
| A1     | A0     | 1           |
| A1     | A1     | 3           |

You play A0 with probability p  
Opp plays A0 with probability q

Your payoff:
- A0: 5q + 2(1−q) = 5q + 2 - 2q = 3q + 2
- A1: 1q + 3(1−q) = q + 3 - 3q = 3 - 2q

Set equal:  
3q + 2 = 3 - 2q → 5q = 1 → q = 0.2

Opponent:
- A0: 5p + 1(1−p) = 5p + 1 - p = 4p + 1
- A1: 2p + 3(1−p) = 2p + 3 - 3p = 3 - p

Set equal:  
4p + 1 = 3 - p → 5p = 2 → p = 0.4

So in equilibrium: **you play A0 with prob 0.4**, **opponent plays A0 with prob 0.2**

Your expected payoff:
- P(A0,A0) = 0.4 × 0.2 = 0.08 → 5
- P(A0,A1) = 0.4 × 0.8 = 0.32 → 2
- P(A1,A0) = 0.6 × 0.2 = 0.12 → 1
- P(A1,A1) = 0.6 × 0.8 = 0.48 → 3

Total:  
0.08×5 = 0.4  
0.32×2 = 0.64  
0.12×1 = 0.12  
0.48×3 = 1.44  
Sum: 0.4 + 0.64 = 1.04; +0.12 = 1.16; +1.44 = **2.6**

Again, **2.6 points** — same as C1.

So **you get 2.6 under both contracts**, worse than base game’s 3.

But wait — is there a **coordination equilibrium**?

Yes! There is also **pure strategy equilibria**.

For example:
- (A0, A0): is it NE?

Check incentives:

- You: if you deviate to A1, get 1 vs 5 → no
- Opponent: if deviates to A1, gets 1 vs 5 → no
- So **(A0, A0) is a NE**

- (A1, A1): both get 3
  - You deviate to A0: get 5? No, under C2, if opp plays A0, you get 1 → but opp plays A1, so you get 2 → which is less than 3 → no
  - So (A1, A1) is also NE

- (A0, A1): you get 2, opp gets 1
  - You: if deviate to A1, get 3 > 2 → so not NE
- (A1, A0): you get 1, opp gets 2
  - You: deviate to A0 → get 5 > 1 → not NE

So **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Under **C2**, you can **coordinate on (A0,A0)** → you get **5**, which is better than 3.

But is that likely?

It depends on **expectations**.

If both believe the other will play A0, they will.

But in the **mixed equilibrium**, you only get 2.6, but **there is a high-payoff equilibrium at 5**.

But can you **get there?**

Now, the **key insight**:

You are **Player 2**, and you **proposed C2**.

If you **approve C2**, you increase its chance of being selected.

But **if C2 is selected**, and both players play (A0,A0), you get **5**, which is better than base game (3) or mixed equilibrium (2.6).

But can you **coordinate**?

Since **C2 strongly incentivizes A0** (you gain +2), and the **cost is only if opponent plays A0**, but if both play A0, the bonus and cost cancel: +2 -2 = 0 → so net unchanged from base.

But **in A0,A1**, you get 2 (vs 0) → better.

In A1,A0, you get 1 (vs 3) → worse.

But because C2 makes A0 **more attractive**, and there is a **high-payoff equilibrium at (A0,A0)**, **you might be able to coordinate**.

But **you are the proposer**, so you **have an incentive to make C2 adoptable**.

Now consider: **What if you approve C2?**

- If C2 is adopted, it's more likely that **both players will play A0** → you get 5.
- But if opponent disapproves, it won't pass.

But you don't know.

But you care about **expected payoff**, assuming contracts are selected randomly from max-approval pool.

Now, let’s suppose you **approve C2**.

- If C1 is approved only by Player 1 → 1 approval
- If you approve C2 → 2 approvals (if both approve), so C2 has highest approval
- Then **C2 is selected** → you get payoff **5** if you coordinate on A0

But will you?

Yes — in equilibrium, (A0,A0) is stable, and since C2 rewards A0, players **should** coordinate on A0.

So **if C2 is adopted, expected payoff for you is 5**, assuming coordination.

But you might get less, but 5 is better than 3.

Similarly, **if C1 is adopted**, you get only 2.6 in equilibrium, or possibly 5 if coordinate, but **C1 only gives +1 bonus**, so less incentive.

But the **key question**: do you prefer C2 over C1?

Yes — because **if C2 is adopted**, you can **get 5**.

Also, **you are the proposer of C2**, so you **want it to be adopted**.

But **do you want to approve C1**?

C1 is proposed by **Player 1**, and you **don’t want them to get a better outcome**.

If C1 is adopted, your expected payoff is **2.6** (in mixed NE), or **5** if coordinate (A0,A0), but **less incentive** than C2.

Moreover, **C1 only gives you +1 bonus**, while C2 gives +2.

And under C2, you get **more benefit from coordination**.

Also, in the **base game**, you get 3; under C1, you get 2.6; under C2, you can get 5.

So **you should approve C2**.

But **do you approve C1**?

- If you approve C1, and Player 1 also approves, then C1 has 2 approvals.
- But C2 also has 2 approvals if you approve it.

So **if you approve both**, then both have 2 approvals → then **one is selected at random**.

So your **expected payoff** if you approve both:

- 50% chance C1 is selected: then expected payoff ~2.6
- 50% chance C2 is selected: then you can get 5 (if coordinate)

So **expected payoff**: 0.5×2.6 + 0.5×5 = 1.3 + 2.5 = **3.8**

But is that safe?

- C2 might lead to coordination on A0 → 5
- C1 leads to mixed equilibrium → 2.6

So yes.

But if you **only approve C2**, and Player 1 **only approves C1**, then:
- C1 has 1 approval
- C2 has 1 approval
- So both have max (1), so one is selected at random
- You get C2 with 50% chance → 0.5×5 + 0.5×2.6 = 3.8 again

But if **Player 1 approves C1 only**, and **you approve C2 only**, both have 1 approval, so **C2 is selected with 50% chance**.

But if **you approve both**, and **Player 1 approves both**, then both have 2 approvals → so **C2 selected with 50%**, C1 with 50%.

So same expected payoff.

But **if you approve C2, you maximize your chance of getting a good outcome**.

But if you **disapprove C1**, then C1 has 1 approval (only Player 1).
C2 has 1 or 2.

If you approve C2 and Player 1 doesn’t approve C1, then C1 has 0 or 1.
C2 has 1.

So C2 wins.

Similarly, if you approve both, C2 wins more often.

But **what if C2 is not approved?** You don’t get it.

But you **want C2 to win**.

Now, **what if you disapprove C1?**

Then:
- C1: only approved by Player 1 → 1 approval
- C2: approved by you → 1 approval
- So both have max (1) → random selection
- 50% C2 → you get 5 (if coordinate)
- 50% C1 → you get 2.6
- Expected: 3.8

But if you **approve C1**, same thing.

But **if you approve C1**, and Player 1 approves C1, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 → so C1 wins → your payoff is 2.6 → worse.

So **you should not approve C1**, because:

- If you approve C1, but Player 1 **also approves it**, then C1 wins, and you get only 2.6
- But if you disapprove it, then C1 cannot win, so at worst, C2 wins (if you approve it)

So **by disapproving C1, you prevent C1 from winning**, which is bad for you.

Therefore, **you should disapprove C1**.

And **approve C2**.

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (Player 1)
- C2: 1 approval (you)
- Max approvals = 1
- Randomly select from contracts with 1 approval → 50% C2, 50% C1
- You get: 0.5×5 + 0.5×2.6 = 3.8

But if you **approve C1**, and Player 1 approves C1, then C1 wins → you get only 2.6 → worse.

So **you should disapprove C1 to avoid that risk**.

Thus, **you should approve only C2**.

### Final Decision:

- **Approve C2** → yes
- **Approve C1** → no

response:
Let's analyze the game and the proposed contracts step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contracts)**

This is a symmetric game between two players, with actions A0 and A1.

**Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):**

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1** | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

This is a *coordination game* with a conflict of interest: both players want to coordinate on (A0, A0) for highest joint payoff (5+5=10), but there's a temptation to defect.

Let’s find the **Nash equilibria** of the base game.

#### Pure strategy equilibria:
- (A0, A0): If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 5 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → P2 prefers A0. Same for P1. So **(A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium**.
- (A1, A1): If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 3 from A1 vs 0 from A0 → P2 prefers A1. Similarly, P1 prefers A1. So **(A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium**.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0; can switch to A1 and get 3 → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3; P2 gets 0; P2 wants to switch to A1 → not equilibrium.

So two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

Mixed strategy: Let’s suppose P2 plays A0 with probability p. Then:
- P1’s expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- P1’s expected payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5.

Similarly, by symmetry, the mixed strategy equilibrium is p = 3/5.

So, multiple equilibria. But both players would prefer the (A0,A0) outcome (10 total points) over (A1,A1) (6 total points).

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract mechanism**

- A contract can be proposed by either player.
- Both players vote to approve the contract via **approval voting**.
- The contract that receives **the most approvals** (from both players) wins.
- If multiple contracts tie for the most approvals, one is chosen **uniformly at random**.

You are **Player 1**, so you decide which contracts to approve.

We must evaluate whether **you** should approve each contract.

Important: Your goal is to **maximize your total expected points** over the entire game, **including** the impact of the contract.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**

> **C1**:  
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- A0: gain +1
- A1: lose -1 (pay 1 → so receive -1 in net, which is a cost)

This means: **A0 is better, A1 is worse**.

Let’s recompute the **modified payoff matrix** under C1:

Let’s define **total payoff = base payoff + contract adjustment**.

**Note**: "drawn equally from other players" → if a player gains +1 for playing A0, that +1 is taken from the opponent.

Similarly, when a player plays A1 and pays -1, that -1 is **paid to the opponent**.

So the **net contract adjustment**:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays anything, you gain +1 (from them), opponent loses -1 (to you).
- If you play A1, you lose -1 (you pay), so opponent gains +1 (from you).

Thus, **contract changes the game by effectively shifting the payoffs by -1 for A1, +1 for A0**.

Let’s build the new matrix.

#### Modified Payoffs for C1 (Player 1 row, Player 2 column)

|           | P2: A0 (gain +1) | P2: A1 (pay -1) |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **P1: A0** | (5 +1, 5 -1) = (6,4) | (0 +1, 3 -1) = (1,2) |
| **P1: A1** | (3 -1, 0 +1) = (2,1) | (3 -1, 3 +1) = (2,4) |

So the new matrix:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (6,4)  | (1,2)  |
| **P1: A1** | (2,1)  | (2,4)  |

Now, let’s analyze this game.

Is there a dominant strategy?

For P1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 6 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A1

No dominant strategy.

Best responses:
- P1: A0 if P2 plays A0; A1 if P2 plays A1
- P2: 
  - If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 4 vs 2 → prefers A0
  - If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 vs 4 → prefers A1

So pure NE:
- (A0, A0): both best reply → (6,4) — valid NE
- (A1, A1): both best reply → (2,4) — valid NE

But (A0,A0) gives P1 6, which is better than (A1,A1) where P1 gets 2.

In (A0,A0), P1 is better off. In (A1,A1), P1 gets only 2.

But note: **the other player (P2) prefers (A1,A1)**, where P2 gets 4, vs 4 in (A0,A0)? Wait, in (A0,A0) P2 gets 4, in (A1,A1) P2 gets 4 → same.

Wait: in (A0,A0): P2 gets 4  
In (A1,A1): P2 gets 4  
But P1 gets 6 vs 2.

So P1 prefers (A0,A0), P2 is indifferent? Wait no:

Wait: In (A1,A1): P2 gets 4 → yes, same as in (A0,A0). So P2 also gets 4 in both equilibria?

Wait, let's double-check:

- (A0,A0): P2 gets 4
- (A1,A1): P2 gets 4 → yes, same.

But in (A0,A1): P2 gets 2
In (A1,A0): P2 gets 1

So P2 is indifferent between (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), both give P2 4.

But P1 strongly prefers (A0,A0) → 6 vs 2.

So **if both players coordinate on (A0,A0), P1 gets 6, P2 gets 4**.

In (A1,A1), P1 gets 2, P2 gets 4 → **P1 is worse off**.

But P2 has no incentive to defect from (A0,A0) → if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 4 from A0, 2 from A1 → so P2 prefers A0.

So (A0,A0) is **P1’s preferred equilibrium**.

Now, is this contract **good for you (P1)**?

Yes — because:
- You are proposing it.
- You know that the contract **shifts incentives toward A0**, and makes (A0,A0) more likely to be played (since A0 is better than A1 for both players now).
- In the original game, (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) were both equilibria, but (A1,A1) was a riskier coordination point? Actually both were symmetric, but now (A0,A0) gives you higher payoff.

Wait — but P2 gets **more** in the contract? No, P2 gets same payoff in both equilibria? No — in (A0,A0), P2 gets 4, in (A1,A1) P2 gets 4 → same.

But in the base game: in (A0,A0) P2 gets 5, in (A1,A1) P2 gets 3 → so P2 actually **worse off** in (A1,A1) than in (A0,A0) in the base game.

Now, contract changes that.

But in the new game, P2 is **indifferent** between (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)? No, wait:

Wait: In the new game, P2’s payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 4
- (A0,A1): 2
- (A1,A0): 1
- (A1,A1): 4

So P2 gets **4 in two equilibria**, 2 or 1 otherwise → so P2 is indifferent between (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), both give same payoff.

But in terms of strategy: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 4 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → best to play A0.
If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → best to play A1.

So P2 will cooperate if P1 plays A0.

Since P1 can commit (in expectation) to play A0, P2 will best respond with A0.

So **(A0,A0) is more stable now** — P2 will follow.

But is there any downside?

Yes: **You (P1) are paying +1 for A0 and being penalized -1 for A1** — but that’s only the contract cost.

But from P1’s point: **in both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), you get higher payoff?**

Wait: in (A0,A0): you get 6 → better than base (5)
In (A1,A1): you get 2 → worse than base (3)

So P1 is better off in (A0,A0) (6 vs 5), worse in (A1,A1) (2 vs 3).

So **if the game reaches (A0,A0), you gain 1 point. If it reaches (A1,A1), you lose 1 point.**

But **since P2 now has incentive to match P1’s strategy**, and if P1 plays A0, P2 wants to play A0, and vice versa, but P2 doesn't gain or lose in (A0,A0) vs (A1,A1), so **P2 is indifferent**.

But **you (P1)** get 6 in (A0,A0), 2 in (A1,A1) — so **you prefer (A0,A0)**.

So **as long as the game coordinates to (A0,A0), you are better off**.

But if it coordinates to (A1,A1), you are worse.

Could P1 play a mixed strategy?

Let’s see: if P1 randomizes, P2 will best respond.

But the key is: is it more likely to coordinate on (A0,A0) now?

Yes, because:
- In base game: both A0 and A1 are symmetric equilibria.
- Now: in (A1,A1), even though payoff is same for P2, **P2 gets same payoff**, but P1 gets less → but P2 doesn’t care.
- However, P2 has no incentive to play A0 if P1 plays A1? No: if P1 plays A1, P2 prefers A1 (gets 4) vs 1 when playing A0 → so P2 prefers A1.

So both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) remain equilibria.

But now:
- (A0,A0): P1 gets 6, P2 gets 4
- (A1,A1): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 4

So **P2 is indifferent** across equilibria.

But P1 **strongly prefers (A0,A0)**.

So if the game can coordinate on (A0,A0), you get 6 — better than base game.

But **if it coordinates on (A1,A1), you get only 2** — worse.

But since P2 is indifferent, could they miscoordinate?

But in practice, coordination depends on expectations.

But **you (P1) are proposing C1** — and you are the one who benefits from A0.

Also, **you are player 1**, so you can use your power to propose.

But the key question: **should you approve C1?**

Yes, because:
- It improves your payoff in the best equilibrium (A0,A0) from 5 to 6.
- You don't want to fall into (A1,A1).
- But **P2 is indifferent between equilibria**, so they might not cooperate to play A0 unless you signal.

But since **C1 makes A0 more attractive only to you**, but for P2, in (A0,A0) they still get 4 — same as (A1,A1) — so P2 has **no incentive to play A0 unless P1 plays A0**.

But if you **play A0**, P2 will best respond with A0 — so (A0,A0) is a possible outcome.

But could the game fall into (A1,A1)? Yes — if P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1.

But **your own incentive is to play A0**, because:
- If P2 plays A0 → you get 6 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → A0 better
- If P2 plays A1 → you get 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → A1 better

So **you are tempted to play A1 when P2 plays A1**.

But if you **believe P2 will play A0**, you play A0 → then P2 plays A0 → equilibrium.

But if you believe P2 plays A1, you play A1 → then P2 plays A1 → equilibrium.

So still two equilibria.

But **you get more in (A0,A0)** → so **if you can coordinate, you prefer it**.

But the **contract doesn’t eliminate the ambiguity**.

However, **you get a net gain in (A0,A0) by 1**.

And **you avoid the worst case?**

Wait — actually, **you are worse off in (A1,A1)**.

But **is (A1,A1) still an equilibrium?**

Yes.

But **since the payoff for P1 in (A1,A1) is 2**, which is worse than base game (3), you are **not better off** overall unless coordination on (A0,A0) is likely.

But **you can’t force a coordination**.

So **this contract might backfire** if the players end up in (A1,A1).

But **is it possible that P2 prefers (A0,A0)?**

P2 gets 4 in both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) → so **indifferent**.

But in base game, P2 got 5 in (A0,A0), 3 in (A1,A1), so P2 **preferred (A0,A0)** — now, **P2 is indifferent**, so P2 **has no incentive to cooperate** toward A0.

So **contract C1 reduces P2’s incentive to choose A0**.

That’s bad — because **P1 wants to coordinate on A0**.

So **C1 makes P2 indifferent**, so P2 has **no special incentive** to play A0.

So **you (P1) may not be able to coordinate on A0**.

Moreover, the **contract penalizes you for A1** — so you are worse off in (A1,A1) — but since you prefer (A0,A0), and P2 doesn’t care, it may not help.

So C1 **may not improve your expected payoff**.

Let’s compute expected payoff under C1.

Suppose both players play pure strategies.

- If (A0,A0): you get 6
- If (A1,A1): you get 2

No other equilibria.

So **you get 6 if they coordinate on A0, 2 if on A1**.

But **you** get **high payoff only if both A0**.

But **P2 has no reason to prefer A0**.

So unless we can somehow coordinate, it’s risky.

But **P2 doesn’t benefit from A0** in this contract.

In base game, P2 gains from A0 (5 vs 3). Now, 4 in both A0 and A1.

So P2 loses incentive to play A0.

Therefore, **P2 may not cooperate** with A0.

So **C1 might lead to (A1,A1)**, where you get only 2 — worse than base game (3).

So **as P1, you are worse off**.

Additionally, **you are proposing C1** — so you may **not want to approve it**?

Wait — **the contract is about approval, not about being the proposer**.

But the question is: **should you approve C1?**

But now we see: **under C1, if the contract is implemented, your worst-case payoff is lower (2 vs 3)**, and P2 has no reason to prefer A0.

So **C1 is bad for you**, unless P2 is willing to coordinate.

But you can't control P2's beliefs.

Therefore, **approval of C1 is risky**.

But let’s compare to base game.

In base game, (A0,A0) exists: you get 5.
(A1,A1): you get 3.

So **you can get 5**, or 3.

With C1, you can get 6 or 2.

So if coordination on (A0,A0) is equally likely, and (A1,A1) equally likely, your expected payoff under C1 is (6+2)/2 = 4, which is **less than** base game (if you assume both equilibria equally likely: (5+3)/2 = 4) — same.

But in base game, the **best** outcome is 5, not 6.

Wait, in base game, (A0,A0) gives 5, C1 gives 6 — so better in that case.

But in base game, (A1,A1) gives 3, C1 gives 2 — worse.

So if both equilibria are equally likely, **expected payoff is 4 both ways**.

But now: **P2 has incentive to avoid A0** — because in base game, A0 gives more to P2, but now it doesn’t.

So P2 may **avoid A0** more now.

So in C1, **likelihood of (A0,A0) may decrease**.

So **your expected payoff may decrease**.

Hence, **C1 is not good for you**.

Moreover, you are **making yourself worse off in (A1,A1)** — which is already a bad outcome.

So **you should not approve C1**.

But wait — **you are the proposer**.

Why would you propose a contract that might hurt you?

Ah — but you **don’t have to approve your own proposal**.

The question is: **should you approve** C1?

You are not forced to approve your own proposal.

So even though you proposed it, you can choose not to approve it.

And given the analysis, **C1 is risky and may reduce your chances of coordination on A0**.

So **you should not approve C1**.

But let’s hold onto this for now.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**

> **C2**:  
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So:
- A0: gain +2 (from other player)
- A1: no change

So this benefits only A0 players.

Let’s compute the modified payoff matrix under C2.

For each player:
- Playing A0: +2 to own payoff (paid by other)
- Playing A1: no change

So:

|           | P2: A0 (gain +2) | P2: A1 (no change) |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **P1: A0** | (5+2, 5-2) = (7,3) | (0+2, 3-2) = (2,1) |
| **P1: A1** | (3,0) | (3,3) |

So new matrix:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (7,3)  | (2,1)  |
| **P1: A1** | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

Now analyze.

For P1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 7 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 2 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → prefers A1

So no dominant strategy.

Best responses:
- P1: A0 if P2 plays A0; A1 if P2 plays A1
- P2:
  - If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
  - If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So pure NE:
- (A0,A0): both best reply → (7,3) — valid
- (A1,A1): both best reply → (3,3) — valid

Now, payoffs for P1:
- (A0,A0): 7
- (A1,A1): 3

P2 gets:
- (A0,A0): 3
- (A1,A1): 3

So **P2 is indifferent between equilibria**.

But P1 gets 7 in (A0,A0), 3 in (A1,A1) — much better.

Now, **does C2 help you (P1)?**

Yes — because:
- You get **7 in (A0,A0)** > base (5)
- You get **3 in (A1,A1)** = base game (3) — same
- But in base game, P2 got 5 in (A0,A0), 3 in (A1,A1), so P2 preferred (A0,A0)
- Now, P2 gets **3 in both**, so P2 is **indifferent** — no longer has incentive to play A0

But **P1 gets more in (A0,A0)**, and no loss in (A1,A1)

So **your best payoff is higher**, and worst is same.

So **you are better off** if coordination occurs on (A0,A0)

But **P2 is indifferent**, so coordination may not happen.

But in base game, P2 had incentive to play A0, now lost that.

But **you are better off in (A0,A0)**, so **you want to coordinate on it**.

But P2 has no incentive to help.

But if **you play A0**, P2 gets 3 (A0) vs 1 (A1) when you play A0 → so P2 **prefers A0**.

Wait: yes — if you play A0, P2 gets 3 from A0, 1 from A1 → so P2 **wants to play A0**.

Similarly, if you play A1, P2 gets 0 from A0, 3 from A1 → so P2 prefers A1.

So **P2 will follow** your strategy.

So **if you play A0, P2 plays A0 → you get 7**

If you play A1, P2 plays A1 → you get 3

So **your choice determines outcome**.

But you want to get 7, so you will play A0.

So **you can achieve (A0,A0) and get 7**.

That is better than base game (5), and better than C1 (where you might get only 2).

In C2, you **can** achieve 7.

In C1, you might be worse off.

So **C2 is better for you**, because:
- You can **enforce coordination on A0** by playing A0
- P2 will respond with A0
- You get 7
- If you don't, you get less

So **C2 gives you a way to get 7**.

In base game, you could get 5, but only by coordination.

Now, **if C2 is approved**, and you play A0, you get 7.

Can P2 prevent this? No — because P2 wants to play A0 if you play A0.

So **it stabilizes (A0,A0)**.

Moreover, **P2 gets same payoff (3) in both equilibria**, but wants to play same as you.

So C2 **makes (A0,A0) the unique equilibrium if you commit to A0**.

In fact, **(A0,A0) is a stronger equilibrium now**, since if you deviate to A1, P2 deviates too, so only (A0,A0) is stable if you start with A0.

So **C2 **(A0,A0), and you get 7.

So **you definitely want C2 to be implemented**.

Now, **should you approve C2**?

Yes — because:
- It benefits you (P1): you can get 7
- It makes (A0,A0) more likely
- P2 is indifferent, but follows you
- You gain 2 compared to base game (7 vs 5)

And in C1, you might end up with only 2.

So **C2 is much better**.

---

### **Step 5: Compare C1 and C2**

- C1: you can get 6 (if (A0,A0)), 2 (if (A1,A1)) — expected risky, worst case worse.
- C2: you can get 7 (if (A0,A0)), 3 (if (A1,A1)) — best case better, worst case same, and you can **guarantee** 7 by playing A0.

Thus, **C2 is strictly better for you**.

Also, **P2** may not like C2 — but P2 is the proposer, so they might still approve because they get 3 either way.

But for you, C2 is superior.

So **you should approve C2**.

Now, **should you approve C1**?

C1: you get 6 if (A0,A0), 2 if (A1,A1)

But in C1, **P2 is indifferent** (gets 4 in both), so **P2 may not coordinate on A0**.

But in C2, **P2 still wants to follow you** — and **you get more**.

Moreover, in C1, **you lose in (A1,A1)** — and P2 has less incentive to avoid it.

But in C2, **you are not punished in (A1,A1)** — same as base.

So **C2 is safer and better**.

**You should NOT approve C1.**

But wait — **if the contract is not approved, what happens?** — you play base game, where you can get 5.

But if C2 is approved, you can get 7 — much better.

So **C2 is better than base game**.

C1 is worse than base game unless coordination occurs.

So only C2 is beneficial.

Also, **approval of C1 might reduce the chance of C2 winning**, if it gets same or more approvals.

But the goal is **to maximize your expected points**.

So you should only approve contracts that **improve your payoff**.

C2 clearly does.

C1 may not — and could harm.

So **approve C2, not C1**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)

We are in a two-player simultaneous game. Each player chooses an action: A0 or A1. The payoff matrix is:

|                 | Other Player: A0 | Other Player: A1 |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **You: A0**     | (5, 5)           | (0, 3)           |
| **You: A1**     | (3, 0)           | (3, 3)           |

This is a **coordination game with a conflict of interest**, but let's analyze it carefully.

- If both choose A0: (5,5) → mutual gain.
- If you choose A0, opponent A1: you get 0, opponent gets 3 → bad for you.
- If you choose A1, opponent A0: you get 3, opponent gets 0 → good for you.
- If both choose A1: (3,3) → moderate outcome.

Let’s find the pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): If you deviate to A1, you get 3 (vs. 5) → not profitable. If opponent deviates to A1, they get 3 (vs. 5) → not profitable. So (A0, A0) is a NE.
- (A1, A1): You get 3. If you deviate to A0, you get 0 → worse. Opponent is indifferent in the same way. So (A1, A1) is also a NE.
- (A0, A1): You get 0. If you deviate to A1, you get 3 → better → not NE.
- (A1, A0): You get 3. If you deviate to A0, you get 5 → better → not NE.

So pure NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Now, what is the best response structure?

- If opponent plays A0:
  - You get 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1:
  - You get 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So your best response is:
- A0 if opponent plays A0
- A1 if opponent plays A1

This means the game has **two pure Nash equilibria** and no dominant strategy.

But since players are symmetric in payoffs (except for roles, but payoffs are symmetric), we might expect a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let’s compute the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let p = probability you play A0, q = probability opponent plays A0.

For indifference in payoff:

You are indifferent between A0 and A1 if:
- Expected payoff from A0: p*(5) + (1-p)*(0) → wait no, that’s not right.

Wait, correction:

Actually, we fix the opponent’s strategy and ask: what p makes the opponent indifferent? But here we are finding mixed strategy equilibrium in symmetric case: both play A0 with probability p.

For a player to be indifferent between A0 and A1, their expected payoff from each must be equal.

Set up:

Let p be the probability the opponent plays A0.

Expected payoff of playing A0:  
→ p * 5 + (1 - p) * 0 = 5p

Expected payoff of playing A1:
→ p * 3 + (1 - p) * 3 = 3

Set equal for indifference:
5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So in symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium, each player plays A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

Expected payoff in this equilibrium:
→ 5p = 3 (or 3, same) → 3 points

But wait: if both play A0 with 0.6, then expected payoff for a player using A0:
= 0.6*5 + 0.4*0 = 3
For A1:
= 0.6*3 + 0.4*3 = 3
So yes, indifferent → equilibrium.

So expected payoff in symmetric mixed NE is 3.

Now, in pure strategies:
- (A0, A0): each gets 5 → better
- (A1, A1): each gets 3

But (A0, A0) is a NE so it’s possible.

So the maximum possible payoff for you is 5, but only if you coordinate on A0.

But since it’s simultaneous move, you can’t guarantee that.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the contract

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Note: "drawn equally from the other players" → means that if you choose A0, you get +1, and the other player(s) lose 1 each ← because it’s taken from them.

Similarly, if you choose A1, you pay 1 point → so you lose 1, and the other player(s) gain 1 each.

Because it’s "drawn equally from the other players" (singular/conjugate), but since only two players, it's simple.

Let’s model this.

Let’s suppose **you sign the contract** and **the other player signs**, then the contract is active.

But the contract only becomes active **if all players sign it**.

So you have to decide: do you want to sign?

But note: you are the one proposing it (via approval voting), so you can only sign it if the other player also signs.

But you are deciding whether to *sign* — it’s a binary choice.

If you don't sign, then the contract doesn’t activate, regardless of the other player.

But the problem says: "the contract becomes active only if all players sign it."

So if you don't sign, no contract.

If you do sign, and the other player signs, then it activates.

But you are trying to **maximize your total points**.

So you need to ask: **Is signing better for you, given that the other player might sign or not?**

But here's a problem: you don’t know what the other player will do.

But the contract was **proposed by Player 1 (you)** and approved via **approval voting**, suggesting that if you sign, the contract activates only if both agree.

But the decision is only yours — you decide whether to sign.

So effectively: you choose to sign or not. If you sign and the other signs, contract is active. Otherwise, not.

But since you don’t know the other player’s action, you need to assume best-case or expected behavior.

But hold on — you’re trying to maximize expected points.

But you have **no information** about the other player’s intentions.

So you need to evaluate: **if the contract is active, does it improve your expected payoff compared to not having it?**

But also: signing the contract might influence the other player’s behavior.

But we are not told that the contract is fully credible or changes incentives — but the key is: **if you sign the contract, and the other player also signs, then it applies.**

But since you don’t know if they will sign, you need to **evaluate whether it is rational to sign**, **assuming the other player might sign too**, and possibly respond rationally.

But perhaps we can assume that both players are rational and will act in their own interest.

So let’s suppose that **if the contract is active, both players will play rationally in the new game.**

So now we must compare two scenarios:

**Scenario 1:** No contract → base game (as above)

**Scenario 2:** Contract is active → new game with modified payoffs

Then: **Should you sign** the contract?

But you only sign **if you believe that signing increases your expected payoff**, **given that the other player may also sign**.

But if you sign, and the other doesn't, then contract doesn't go through — so you get the base game.

If you sign and they sign, you get the contract game.

So your expected payoff depends on:
- Your signing (sign or not)
- The other player’s signing (unknown)

But since you don’t know, you can only decide based on **expected outcome under rational play**.

But the key insight: **The contract changes the payoffs**.

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix under the contract**, assuming both players sign.

---

### Step 3: New payoff matrix with the contract active

The contract adds extra payments based on your own action:

- If you play A0 → you get +1 (from the other player)
- If you play A1 → you lose 1 (to the other player)

So effects:
- You receive +1 if you choose A0 → gain 1
- You pay 1 if you choose A1 → lose 1
- The other player gets the opposite: -1 if you choose A0, +1 if you choose A1

So we can **add these extras to the original payoffs**.

Let’s recompute the joint payoffs:

Original payoffs:

|          | A0 (other) | A1 (other) |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **A0**  | (5,5)      | (0,3)      |
| **A1**  | (3,0)      | (3,3)      |

Now apply contract effects:

- If you play A0: +1 to you, -1 to opponent
- If you play A1: -1 to you, +1 to opponent

So now:

#### (A0, A0):
- You: 5 + 1 = 6
- Opponent: 5 - 1 = 4

#### (A0, A1):
- You: 0 + 1 = 1
- Opponent: 3 + 1 = 4 (because opponent played A1 → opponent gets +1)

#### (A1, A0):
- You: 3 - 1 = 2
- Opponent: 0 - 1 = -1

#### (A1, A1):
- You: 3 - 1 = 2
- Opponent: 3 + 1 = 4

So the new payoff matrix (with contract active) is:

|          | A0 (other) | A1 (other) |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **A0**  | (6, 4)     | (1, 4)     |
| **A1**  | (2, -1)    | (2, 4)     |

Let’s analyze this new game.

---

### Step 4: Analyze the contract game

Check for pure strategy Nash equilibria.

1. (A0, A0): 
   - You get 6. If you deviate to A1 → you get 2 < 6 → no incentive.
   - Opponent gets 4. If opponent deviates to A1 → gets 4 (same) → indifferent. So could deviate.
     - But since payoff same, deviation is non-profitable → still equilibrium? Yes, weakly.

     But let's see: opponent is indifferent: 4 vs 4 → so can play A1.
     But if they play A1, you get only 1 → worse for you → you wouldn’t want that.

     But equilibrium requires that players have no incentive to deviate. Since opponent is indifferent → they are not worse off — so (A0, A0) is a NE.

2. (A0, A1):
   - You get 1. If you deviate to A1 → you get 2 > 1 → better → so not NE.

3. (A1, A0):
   - You get 2. If you deviate to A0 → get 6 > 2 → better → not NE.

4. (A1, A1):
   - You get 2. If you deviate to A0 → get 1 < 2 → worse → good.
   - Opponent gets 4. If they deviate to A0 → get 4 → same. So could deviate.
     - But since same payoff, not strictly worse → so (A1, A1) is a weak NE.

So both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are NE in the contract game?

But is (A1, A1) really a NE?

- You: 2 → A0 gives 1 < 2 → stay.
- Opponent: 4 → A0 gives 4 → same → so indifferent → no incentive to change.

So yes, both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are NE.

But now look at incentive.

What if both players are rational? Is there a dominant strategy?

Check best responses.

Fix opponent’s strategy:

If opponent plays A0:
- You: A0 → 6, A1 → 2 → so prefer A0

If opponent plays A1:
- You: A0 → 1, A1 → 2 → prefer A1

So best response:
- If opponent plays A0 → you play A0
- If opponent plays A1 → you play A1

Same as before → symmetric best responses.

So (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are the only pure NE.

Now compute symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let p = probability you play A0.

You are indifferent when:
E[A0] = E[A1]

E[A0] = p * 6 + (1-p) * 1 = 6p + 1 - p = 5p + 1

E[A1] = p * 2 + (1-p) * 2 = 2

Set equal:
5p + 1 = 2 → 5p = 1 → p = 0.2

So symmetric mixed strategy: each plays A0 with 0.2, A1 with 0.8

Expected payoff for you:
→ Either: 5*(0.2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
→ Or: 2 → same

So expected payoff = 2

Now compare to **base game**:

- In base game: symmetric mixed NE gives 3
- Pure NE: (A0,A0) gives 5, (A1,A1) gives 3

So in base game, **you can get 5** in equilibrium — but depends on coordination.

But under contract game, **no matter what**, you cannot get 5 anymore.

In contract game, best you can do in NE is:

- (A0,A0): you get 6
- But can opponent get better? Opponent gets 4 → they would prefer to deviate?

Wait: in (A0,A0), opponent gets 4. If they deviate to A1, they get 4 → same.

So opponent is indifferent → so they might not deviate.

So (A0,A0) is still a NE, and you get 6.

But can you trust that?

But now: if you play A0, you get 6 if opponent plays A0.

But if you play A1, you get 2.

But the opponent has no incentive to play A0 either?

Wait — look at opponent's incentives in the contract game.

Opponent:
- If you play A0:
  - Opponent: A0 → 4, A1 → 4 → indifferent
- If you play A1:
  - Opponent: A0 → -1, A1 → 4 → prefers A1

So if you play A0, opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.

If you play A1, opponent prefers A1.

So the best response from opponent:
- If you play A0 → any response (A0 or A1) gives 4
- If you play A1 → opponent plays A1

Now for you:

- If opponent plays A0 → you prefer A0 (6) over A1 (2)
- If opponent plays A1 → you prefer A1 (2) over A0 (1)

So best responses are the same.

But here's the issue: in (A0,A0), you get 6, opponent gets 4 → opponent is indifferent → so they could play A1.

But if they play A1, you get 1 → worse.

So rational opponent may not want to coordinate on A0 — because they get same payoff anyway.

But if they play A1, you get 1 → but you might not play A0.

But this suggests that **A0 is not robust**.

In fact, the only **strict** NE is (A1,A1):

- You: 2 → if you deviate to A0: get 1 < 2 → worse
- Opponent: 4 → if they deviate to A0: get -1 < 4 → worse

So **(A1,A1) is a strict NE**.

(A0,A0) is only weak NE — because opponent is indifferent.

So rational players may avoid (A0,A0) if they fear the other may deviate.

Hence, **the most stable outcome is likely (A1,A1)**.

In (A1,A1), you get 2.

Compare to base game:

In base game, possible outcomes:
- (A0,A0): you get 5 → great
- (A1,A1): you get 3 → ok
- (A1,A1) is NE → but so is (A0,A0)

But in base game, if both players are rational, they might coordinate on (A0,A0) because it gives 5 > 3.

But in the contract game, doing A0 gives you +1, but **forces opponent to lose 1**.

But in the contract game, playing A0 can hurt your payoff if opponent doesn’t reciprocate.

Wait — let's go back.

In the contract game:

- If you play A0 → you get +1, opponent loses 1
- But opponent gains from your A1 decision

But in the payoff matrix, if you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 1 (not bad), but opponent gets 4.

But the key is: in contract game, **playing A0 is risky** because it may lead to you earning only 1 (if opponent plays A1), and you lose the advantage.

But in the base game, if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0 → much worse.

Wait — so the contract **protects you** a bit.

In base game:
- A0 vs A1: you get 0
- With contract: A0 vs A1: you get 1 → better
- But you pay for A1: in base game, you get 3; with contract,

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

- Respond with a valid JSON object.

Your previous response was:
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)

We are in a two-player simultaneous game. Each player chooses an action: A0 or A1. The payoff matrix is:

|                 | Other Player: A0 | Other Player: A1 |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **You: A0**     | (5, 5)           | (0, 3)           |
| **You: A1**     | (3, 0)           | (3, 3)           |

This is a **coordination game with a conflict of interest**, but let's analyze it carefully.

- If both choose A0: (5,5) → mutual gain.
- If you choose A0, opponent A1: you get 0, opponent gets 3 → bad for you.
- If you choose A1, opponent A0: you get 3, opponent gets 0 → good for you.
- If both choose A1: (3,3) → moderate outcome.

Let’s find the pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): If you deviate to A1, you get 3 (vs. 5) → not profitable. If opponent deviates to A1, they get 3 (vs. 5) → not profitable. So (A0, A0) is a NE.
- (A1, A1): You get 3. If you deviate to A0, you get 0 → worse. Opponent is indifferent in the same way. So (A1, A1) is also a NE.
- (A0, A1): You get 0. If you deviate to A1, you get 3 → better → not NE.
- (A1, A0): You get 3. If you deviate to A0, you get 5 → better → not NE.

So pure NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Now, what is the best response structure?

- If opponent plays A0:
  - You get 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1:
  - You get 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So your best response is:
- A0 if opponent plays A0
- A1 if opponent plays A1

This means the game has **two pure Nash equilibria** and no dominant strategy.

But since players are symmetric in payoffs (except for roles, but payoffs are symmetric), we might expect a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let’s compute the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let p = probability you play A0, q = probability opponent plays A0.

For indifference in payoff:

You are indifferent between A0 and A1 if:
- Expected payoff from A0: p*(5) + (1-p)*(0) → wait no, that’s not right.

Wait, correction:

Actually, we fix the opponent’s strategy and ask: what p makes the opponent indifferent? But here we are finding mixed strategy equilibrium in symmetric case: both play A0 with probability p.

For a player to be indifferent between A0 and A1, their expected payoff from each must be equal.

Set up:

Let p be the probability the opponent plays A0.

Expected payoff of playing A0:  
→ p * 5 + (1 - p) * 0 = 5p

Expected payoff of playing A1:
→ p * 3 + (1 - p) * 3 = 3

Set equal for indifference:
5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So in symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium, each player plays A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

Expected payoff in this equilibrium:
→ 5p = 3 (or 3, same) → 3 points

But wait: if both play A0 with 0.6, then expected payoff for a player using A0:
= 0.6*5 + 0.4*0 = 3
For A1:
= 0.6*3 + 0.4*3 = 3
So yes, indifferent → equilibrium.

So expected payoff in symmetric mixed NE is 3.

Now, in pure strategies:
- (A0, A0): each gets 5 → better
- (A1, A1): each gets 3

But (A0, A0) is a NE so it’s possible.

So the maximum possible payoff for you is 5, but only if you coordinate on A0.

But since it’s simultaneous move, you can’t guarantee that.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the contract

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Note: "drawn equally from the other players" → means that if you choose A0, you get +1, and the other player(s) lose 1 each ← because it’s taken from them.

Similarly, if you choose A1, you pay 1 point → so you lose 1, and the other player(s) gain 1 each.

Because it’s "drawn equally from the other players" (singular/conjugate), but since only two players, it's simple.

Let’s model this.

Let’s suppose **you sign the contract** and **the other player signs**, then the contract is active.

But the contract only becomes active **if all players sign it**.

So you have to decide: do you want to sign?

But note: you are the one proposing it (via approval voting), so you can only sign it if the other player also signs.

But you are deciding whether to *sign* — it’s a binary choice.

If you don't sign, then the contract doesn’t activate, regardless of the other player.

But the problem says: "the contract becomes active only if all players sign it."

So if you don't sign, no contract.

If you do sign, and the other player signs, then it activates.

But you are trying to **maximize your total points**.

So you need to ask: **Is signing better for you, given that the other player might sign or not?**

But here's a problem: you don’t know what the other player will do.

But the contract was **proposed by Player 1 (you)** and approved via **approval voting**, suggesting that if you sign, the contract activates only if both agree.

But the decision is only yours — you decide whether to sign.

So effectively: you choose to sign or not. If you sign and the other signs, contract is active. Otherwise, not.

But since you don’t know the other player’s action, you need to assume best-case or expected behavior.

But hold on — you’re trying to maximize expected points.

But you have **no information** about the other player’s intentions.

So you need to evaluate: **if the contract is active, does it improve your expected payoff compared to not having it?**

But also: signing the contract might influence the other player’s behavior.

But we are not told that the contract is fully credible or changes incentives — but the key is: **if you sign the contract, and the other player also signs, then it applies.**

But since you don’t know if they will sign, you need to **evaluate whether it is rational to sign**, **assuming the other player might sign too**, and possibly respond rationally.

But perhaps we can assume that both players are rational and will act in their own interest.

So let’s suppose that **if the contract is active, both players will play rationally in the new game.**

So now we must compare two scenarios:

**Scenario 1:** No contract → base game (as above)

**Scenario 2:** Contract is active → new game with modified payoffs

Then: **Should you sign** the contract?

But you only sign **if you believe that signing increases your expected payoff**, **given that the other player may also sign**.

But if you sign, and the other doesn't, then contract doesn't go through — so you get the base game.

If you sign and they sign, you get the contract game.

So your expected payoff depends on:
- Your signing (sign or not)
- The other player’s signing (unknown)

But since you don’t know, you can only decide based on **expected outcome under rational play**.

But the key insight: **The contract changes the payoffs**.

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix under the contract**, assuming both players sign.

---

### Step 3: New payoff matrix with the contract active

The contract adds extra payments based on your own action:

- If you play A0 → you get +1 (from the other player)
- If you play A1 → you lose 1 (to the other player)

So effects:
- You receive +1 if you choose A0 → gain 1
- You pay 1 if you choose A1 → lose 1
- The other player gets the opposite: -1 if you choose A0, +1 if you choose A1

So we can **add these extras to the original payoffs**.

Let’s recompute the joint payoffs:

Original payoffs:

|          | A0 (other) | A1 (other) |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **A0**  | (5,5)      | (0,3)      |
| **A1**  | (3,0)      | (3,3)      |

Now apply contract effects:

- If you play A0: +1 to you, -1 to opponent
- If you play A1: -1 to you, +1 to opponent

So now:

#### (A0, A0):
- You: 5 + 1 = 6
- Opponent: 5 - 1 = 4

#### (A0, A1):
- You: 0 + 1 = 1
- Opponent: 3 + 1 = 4 (because opponent played A1 → opponent gets +1)

#### (A1, A0):
- You: 3 - 1 = 2
- Opponent: 0 - 1 = -1

#### (A1, A1):
- You: 3 - 1 = 2
- Opponent: 3 + 1 = 4

So the new payoff matrix (with contract active) is:

|          | A0 (other) | A1 (other) |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **A0**  | (6, 4)     | (1, 4)     |
| **A1**  | (2, -1)    | (2, 4)     |

Let’s analyze this new game.

---

### Step 4: Analyze the contract game

Check for pure strategy Nash equilibria.

1. (A0, A0): 
   - You get 6. If you deviate to A1 → you get 2 < 6 → no incentive.
   - Opponent gets 4. If opponent deviates to A1 → gets 4 (same) → indifferent. So could deviate.
     - But since payoff same, deviation is non-profitable → still equilibrium? Yes, weakly.

     But let's see: opponent is indifferent: 4 vs 4 → so can play A1.
     But if they play A1, you get only 1 → worse for you → you wouldn’t want that.

     But equilibrium requires that players have no incentive to deviate. Since opponent is indifferent → they are not worse off — so (A0, A0) is a NE.

2. (A0, A1):
   - You get 1. If you deviate to A1 → you get 2 > 1 → better → so not NE.

3. (A1, A0):
   - You get 2. If you deviate to A0 → get 6 > 2 → better → not NE.

4. (A1, A1):
   - You get 2. If you deviate to A0 → get 1 < 2 → worse → good.
   - Opponent gets 4. If they deviate to A0 → get 4 → same. So could deviate.
     - But since same payoff, not strictly worse → so (A1, A1) is a weak NE.

So both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are NE in the contract game?

But is (A1, A1) really a NE?

- You: 2 → A0 gives 1 < 2 → stay.
- Opponent: 4 → A0 gives 4 → same → so indifferent → no incentive to change.

So yes, both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are NE.

But now look at incentive.

What if both players are rational? Is there a dominant strategy?

Check best responses.

Fix opponent’s strategy:

If opponent plays A0:
- You: A0 → 6, A1 → 2 → so prefer A0

If opponent plays A1:
- You: A0 → 1, A1 → 2 → prefer A1

So best response:
- If opponent plays A0 → you play A0
- If opponent plays A1 → you play A1

Same as before → symmetric best responses.

So (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are the only pure NE.

Now compute symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let p = probability you play A0.

You are indifferent when:
E[A0] = E[A1]

E[A0] = p * 6 + (1-p) * 1 = 6p + 1 - p = 5p + 1

E[A1] = p * 2 + (1-p) * 2 = 2

Set equal:
5p + 1 = 2 → 5p = 1 → p = 0.2

So symmetric mixed strategy: each plays A0 with 0.2, A1 with 0.8

Expected payoff for you:
→ Either: 5*(0.2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
→ Or: 2 → same

So expected payoff = 2

Now compare to **base game**:

- In base game: symmetric mixed NE gives 3
- Pure NE: (A0,A0) gives 5, (A1,A1) gives 3

So in base game, **you can get 5** in equilibrium — but depends on coordination.

But under contract game, **no matter what**, you cannot get 5 anymore.

In contract game, best you can do in NE is:

- (A0,A0): you get 6
- But can opponent get better? Opponent gets 4 → they would prefer to deviate?

Wait: in (A0,A0), opponent gets 4. If they deviate to A1, they get 4 → same.

So opponent is indifferent → so they might not deviate.

So (A0,A0) is still a NE, and you get 6.

But can you trust that?

But now: if you play A0, you get 6 if opponent plays A0.

But if you play A1, you get 2.

But the opponent has no incentive to play A0 either?

Wait — look at opponent's incentives in the contract game.

Opponent:
- If you play A0:
  - Opponent: A0 → 4, A1 → 4 → indifferent
- If you play A1:
  - Opponent: A0 → -1, A1 → 4 → prefers A1

So if you play A0, opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.

If you play A1, opponent prefers A1.

So the best response from opponent:
- If you play A0 → any response (A0 or A1) gives 4
- If you play A1 → opponent plays A1

Now for you:

- If opponent plays A0 → you prefer A0 (6) over A1 (2)
- If opponent plays A1 → you prefer A1 (2) over A0 (1)

So best responses are the same.

But here's the issue: in (A0,A0), you get 6, opponent gets 4 → opponent is indifferent → so they could play A1.

But if they play A1, you get 1 → worse.

So rational opponent may not want to coordinate on A0 — because they get same payoff anyway.

But if they play A1, you get 1 → but you might not play A0.

But this suggests that **A0 is not robust**.

In fact, the only **strict** NE is (A1,A1):

- You: 2 → if you deviate to A0: get 1 < 2 → worse
- Opponent: 4 → if they deviate to A0: get -1 < 4 → worse

So **(A1,A1) is a strict NE**.

(A0,A0) is only weak NE — because opponent is indifferent.

So rational players may avoid (A0,A0) if they fear the other may deviate.

Hence, **the most stable outcome is likely (A1,A1)**.

In (A1,A1), you get 2.

Compare to base game:

In base game, possible outcomes:
- (A0,A0): you get 5 → great
- (A1,A1): you get 3 → ok
- (A1,A1) is NE → but so is (A0,A0)

But in base game, if both players are rational, they might coordinate on (A0,A0) because it gives 5 > 3.

But in the contract game, doing A0 gives you +1, but **forces opponent to lose 1**.

But in the contract game, playing A0 can hurt your payoff if opponent doesn’t reciprocate.

Wait — let's go back.

In the contract game:

- If you play A0 → you get +1, opponent loses 1
- But opponent gains from your A1 decision

But in the payoff matrix, if you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 1 (not bad), but opponent gets 4.

But the key is: in contract game, **playing A0 is risky** because it may lead to you earning only 1 (if opponent plays A1), and you lose the advantage.

But in the base game, if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0 → much worse.

Wait — so the contract **protects you** a bit.

In base game:
- A0 vs A1: you get 0
- With contract: A0 vs A1: you get 1 → better
- But you pay for A1: in base game, you get 3; with contract,

Otherwise, not.\n\nBut since you don’t know the other player’s action, you need to assume best-case or expected behavior.\n\nBut hold on — you’re trying to maximize expected points.\n\nBut you have **no information** about the other player’s intentions.\n\nSo you need to evaluate: **if the contract is active, does it improve your expected payoff compared to not having it?**\n\nBut also: signing the contract might influence the other player’s behavior.\n\nBut we are not told that the contract is fully credible or changes incentives — but the key is: **if you sign the contract, and the other player also signs, then it applies.**\n\nBut since you don’t know if they will sign, you need to **evaluate whether it is rational to sign**, **assuming the other player might sign too**, and possibly respond rationally.\n\nBut perhaps we can assume that both players are rational and will act in their own interest.\n\nSo let’s suppose that **if the contract is active, both players will play rationally in the new game.**\n\nSo now we must compare two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:** No contract → base game (as above)\n\n**Scenario 2:** Contract is active → new game with modified payoffs\n\nThen: **Should you sign** the contract?\n\nBut you only sign **if you believe that signing increases your expected payoff**, **given that the other player may also sign**.\n\nBut if you sign, and the other doesn\'t, then contract doesn\'t go through — so you get the base game.\n\nIf you sign and they sign, you get the contract game.\n\nSo your expected payoff depends on:\n- Your signing (sign or not)\n- The other player’s signing (unknown)\n\nBut since you don’t know, you can only decide based on **expected outcome under rational play**.\n\nBut the key insight: **The contract changes the payoffs**.\n\nLet’s compute the **new payoff matrix under the contract**, assuming both players sign.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: New payoff matrix with the contract active\n\nThe contract adds extra payments based on your own action:\n\n- If you play A0 → you get +1 (from the other player)\n- If you play A1 → you lose 1 (to the other player)\n\nSo effects:\n- You receive +1 if you choose A0 → gain 1\n- You pay 1 if you choose A1 → lose 1\n- The other player gets the opposite: -1 if you choose A0, +1 if you choose A1\n\nSo we can **add these extras to the original payoffs**.\n\nLet’s recompute the joint payoffs:\n\nOriginal payoffs:\n\n|          | A0 (other) | A1 (other) |\n|----------|------------|------------|\n| **A0**  | (5,5)      | (0,3)      |\n| **A1**  | (3,0)      | (3,3)      |\n\nNow apply contract effects:\n\n- If you play A0: +1 to you, -1 to opponent\n- If you play A1: -1 to you, +1 to opponent\n\nSo now:\n\n#### (A0, A0):\n- You: 5 + 1 = 6\n- Opponent: 5 - 1 = 4\n\n#### (A0, A1):\n- You: 0 + 1 = 1\n- Opponent: 3 + 1 = 4 (because opponent played A1 → opponent gets +1)\n\n#### (A1, A0):\n- You: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Opponent: 0 - 1 = -1\n\n#### (A1, A1):\n- You: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Opponent: 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo the new payoff matrix (with contract active) is:\n\n|          | A0 (other) | A1 (other) |\n|----------|------------|------------|\n| **A0**  | (6, 4)     | (1, 4)     |\n| **A1**  | (2, -1)    | (2, 4)     |\n\nLet’s analyze this new game.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the contract game\n\nCheck for pure strategy Nash equilibria.\n\n1. (A0, A0): \n   - You get 6. If you deviate to A1 → you get 2 < 6 → no incentive.\n   - Opponent gets 4. If opponent deviates to A1 → gets 4 (same) → indifferent. So could deviate.\n     - But since payoff same, deviation is non-profitable → still equilibrium? Yes, weakly.\n\n     But let\'s see: opponent is indifferent: 4 vs 4 → so can play A1.\n     But if they play A1, you get only 1 → worse for you → you wouldn’t want that.\n\n     But equilibrium requires that players have no incentive to deviate. Since opponent is indifferent → they are not worse off — so (A0, A0) is a NE.\n\n2. (A0, A1):\n   - You get 1. If you deviate to A1 → you get 2 > 1 → better → so not NE.\n\n3. (A1, A0):\n   - You get 2. If you deviate to A0 → get 6 > 2 → better → not NE.\n\n4. (A1, A1):\n   - You get 2. If you deviate to A0 → get 1 < 2 → worse → good.\n   - Opponent gets 4. If they deviate to A0 → get 4 → same. So could deviate.\n     - But since same payoff, not strictly worse → so (A1, A1) is a weak NE.\n\nSo both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are NE in the contract game?\n\nBut is (A1, A1) really a NE?\n\n- You: 2 → A0 gives 1 < 2 → stay.\n- Opponent: 4 → A0 gives 4 → same → so indifferent → no incentive to change.\n\nSo yes, both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are NE.\n\nBut now look at incentive.\n\nWhat if both players are rational? Is there a dominant strategy?\n\nCheck best responses.\n\nFix opponent’s strategy:\n\nIf opponent plays A0:\n- You: A0 → 6, A1 → 2 → so prefer A0\n\nIf opponent plays A1:\n- You: A0 → 1, A1 → 2 → prefer A1\n\nSo best response:\n- If opponent plays A0 → you play A0\n- If opponent plays A1 → you play A1\n\nSame as before → symmetric best responses.\n\nSo (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are the only pure NE.\n\nNow compute symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium.\n\nLet p = probability you play A0.\n\nYou are indifferent when:\nE[A0] = E[A1]\n\nE[A0] = p * 6 + (1-p) * 1 = 6p + 1 - p = 5p + 1\n\nE[A1] = p * 2 + (1-p) * 2 = 2\n\nSet equal:\n5p + 1 = 2 → 5p = 1 → p = 0.2\n\nSo symmetric mixed strategy: each plays A0 with 0.2, A1 with 0.8\n\nExpected payoff for you:\n→ Either: 5*(0.2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n→ Or: 2 → same\n\nSo expected payoff = 2\n\nNow compare to **base game**:\n\n- In base game: symmetric mixed NE gives 3\n- Pure NE: (A0,A0) gives 5, (A1,A1) gives 3\n\nSo in base game, **you can get 5** in equilibrium — but depends on coordination.\n\nBut under contract game, **no matter what**, you cannot get 5 anymore.\n\nIn contract game, best you can do in NE is:\n\n- (A0,A0): you get 6\n- But can opponent get better? Opponent gets 4 → they would prefer to deviate?\n\nWait: in (A0,A0), opponent gets 4. If they deviate to A1, they get 4 → same.\n\nSo opponent is indifferent → so they might not deviate.\n\nSo (A0,A0) is still a NE, and you get 6.\n\nBut can you trust that?\n\nBut now: if you play A0, you get 6 if opponent plays A0.\n\nBut if you play A1, you get 2.\n\nBut the opponent has no incentive to play A0 either?\n\nWait — look at opponent\'s incentives in the contract game.\n\nOpponent:\n- If you play A0:\n  - Opponent: A0 → 4, A1 → 4 → indifferent\n- If you play A1:\n  - Opponent: A0 → -1, A1 → 4 → prefers A1\n\nSo if you play A0, opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nIf you play A1, opponent prefers A1.\n\nSo the best response from opponent:\n- If you play A0 → any response (A0 or A1) gives 4\n- If you play A1 → opponent plays A1\n\nNow for you:\n\n- If opponent plays A0 → you prefer A0 (6) over A1 (2)\n- If opponent plays A1 → you prefer A1 (2) over A0 (1)\n\nSo best responses are the same.\n\nBut here\'s the issue: in (A0,A0), you get 6, opponent gets 4 → opponent is indifferent → so they could play A1.\n\nBut if they play A1, you get 1 → worse.\n\nSo rational opponent may not want to coordinate on A0 — because they get same payoff anyway.\n\nBut if they play A1, you get 1 → but you might not play A0.\n\nBut this suggests that **A0 is not robust**.\n\nIn fact, the only **strict** NE is (A1,A1):\n\n- You: 2 → if you deviate to A0: get 1 < 2 → worse\n- Opponent: 4 → if they deviate to A0: get -1 < 4 → worse\n\nSo **(A1,A1) is a strict NE**.\n\n(A0,A0) is only weak NE — because opponent is indifferent.\n\nSo rational players may avoid (A0,A0) if they fear the other may deviate.\n\nHence, **the most stable outcome is likely (A1,A1)**.\n\nIn (A1,A1), you get 2.\n\nCompare to base game:\n\nIn base game, possible outcomes:\n- (A0,A0): you get 5 → great\n- (A1,A1): you get 3 → ok\n- (A1,A1) is NE → but so is (A0,A0)\n\nBut in base game, if both players are rational, they might coordinate on (A0,A0) because it gives 5 > 3.\n\nBut in the contract game, doing A0 gives you +1, but **forces opponent to lose 1**.\n\nBut in the contract game, playing A0 can hurt your payoff if opponent doesn’t reciprocate.\n\nWait — let\'s go back.\n\nIn the contract game:\n\n- If you play A0 → you get +1, opponent loses 1\n- But opponent gains from your A1 decision\n\nBut in the payoff matrix, if you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 1 (not bad), but opponent gets 4.\n\nBut the key is: in contract game, **playing A0 is risky** because it may lead to you earning only 1 (if opponent plays A1), and you lose the advantage.\n\nBut in the base game, if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0 → much worse.\n\nWait — so the contract **protects you** a bit.\n\nIn base game:\n- A0 vs A1: you get 0\n- With contract: A0 vs A1: you get 1 → better\n- But you pay for A1: in base game, you get 3; with contract,'

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

Let's analyze this step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

The base game is a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| A1     | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

This is **not** a prisoner’s dilemma, but it resembles a coordination game with a conflict of interest.

- If both play A0: (5,5) — best outcome for both
- If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3
- If P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0
- If both play A1: (3,3) — decent, but less than (5,5)

So, **mutual A0 is Pareto optimal**.

However, there is a temptation to deviate:
- If you think the other will play A0, you get 5 for choosing A0, but only 3 for A1 → so A0 is better.
- If you think the other will play A1, you get 0 for A0, but 3 for A1 → so A1 is better.

So there are two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

But (A0, A0) is better for both. So if players can coordinate, they should aim for A0.

Now, the **contract** system is introduced.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- Choosing A0 → +1 (paid by the other player)
- Choosing A1 → -1 (paid to the other player)

This creates an **asymmetric impact** depending on the action.

Let’s see how this modifies the payoffs.

---

#### **Effect of C1 on Payoffs (Player 1)**

Let’s build the **new payoff matrix under C1**.

Remember, the **contract payments are drawn from the other player(s)**. Since there are only two players, each payment is directly from the other.

- So, if **you choose A0**, you get +1 **from the other player**.
- If **you choose A1**, the other player gets +1 **from you** (i.e., you pay 1).

Let’s compute for Player 1’s total expected payoff under C1:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (gets -1 from P1 if P1 chooses A1) | A1 (gets +1 from P1 if P1 chooses A0) |
|--------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| A0     | Base: (5,5) → P1 gets 5 + 1 (for A0) = **6**<br>But P2 chooses A0 → P2 gets +1 from P1? Wait: Need to think carefully.

Wait — **the contract is applied per player’s action.**

So:
- **Each player's payment is based on their own action**, and the transfer is **from the other player**.

So:
- If **Player 1 chooses A0**, then Player 1 gets +1 **from Player 2**.
- If **Player 1 chooses A1**, then Player 1 pays -1 → i.e., gives 1 to Player 2.

Similarly for Player 2.

So **independent of opponent**, your payment **depends only on your own choice**.

So the **total payoff for Player 1** becomes:
> Base payoff + (1 if P1 chose A0) - (1 if P1 chose A1)

Wait: Actually:
- If P1 chooses A0 → gets +1 from P2
- If P1 chooses A1 → gives +1 to P2 → so P1 gets -1
→ So net: +1 if A0, -1 if A1

So P1's total payoff = Base payoff + (1 if P1 chooses A0) - (1 if P1 chooses A1)

Similarly for P2.

Let’s build the new matrix **under C1**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2 gets +1 from P1 if P1=A0) | A1 (P2 gets -1 from P1 if P1=A1) |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| A0     | P1: 5 +1 = **6**, P2: 5 -1 = **4** | P1: 0 +1 = **1**, P2: 3 -1 = **2** |
| A1     | P1: 3 -1 = **2**, P2: 0 +1 = **1** | P1: 3 -1 = **2**, P2: 3 +1 = **4** |

Wait — let's double-check:

- When P1 chooses A0: gets +1 from P2
- When P1 chooses A1: pays 1 to P2 → so P1 gets -1

So:

- (A0, A0): P1: 5 +1 = 6; P2: 5 -1 = 4
- (A0, A1): P1: 0 +1 = 1; P2: 3 +1 = 4 (P2 chose A1 → P2 pays -1 → so P2 gets -1? Wait no)

Hold on: **Clarify transfer logic:**

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive +1 from the other player."

So:
- Player X chooses A0 → gets +1 from other player
- Player X chooses A1 → pays +1 to other player → so player X gets -1

So it’s **symmetric**.

So for (A0, A1):
- P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +1 from P2
- P2 chooses A1 → P2 pays +1 to P1 → so P2 gets -1 from P1

Wait — that would mean P2 gets paid by P1?

No: **if P2 chooses A1, then P2 pays 1 to P1** → so P1 gets +1 from P2.

But also, P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +1 from P2.

So **both** get +1?

This is a **problem** — both players are getting +1 from the same source?

Wait — **"drawn equally from the other players"** — but if you're only one other player, then "equally" just means from that player.

But if both players get +1 from each other?

Let’s read carefully:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other players."

So if a player chooses A0 → they receive 1 from each other player.

But there’s only one other player — so they receive 1 from that player.

Similarly, if a player chooses A1 → they pay 1 to each other player → so they pay 1 to the other player.

But if **both** players choose A0 → each receives +1 from the other → so both get +1.

But then **the net transfer is 0** — they each give 1 and receive 1 → no net loss.

But that can’t happen: the game would then be symmetric.

Wait — think of **total payment**.

But if **both players choose A0**:
- P1 gets +1 from P2
- P2 gets +1 from P1
→ Net: each gains 1 → so total money injected: +2

But if **both choose A1**:
- P1 pays 1 to P2 (because P1 chose A1)
- P2 pays 1 to P1 (because P2 chose A1)
→ So each pays 1, receives 1 → net 0

But if **P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1**:
- P1 gets +1 from P2 (since P1 chose A0)
- P2 pays +1 to P1 (since P2 chose A1) → so P2 gives 1 to P1
→ So **both** result in P1 gaining 1, P2 losing 1

Wait — that’s the same.

Let’s reanalyze:

- **Each action triggers a transfer from the player to the other**:
  - A0 → player **gets** 1 from the other player
  - A1 → player **pays** 1 to the other player

So:
- A0: gain of +1 from opponent
- A1: loss of -1 to opponent (i.e., net -1 for self)

So in all cases, **the transfer is symmetric**.

Now compute the **net transfer** for each player:

Case (A0, A0):
- P1: A0 → +1 (from P2)
- P2: A0 → +1 (from P1)
→ P1 total: 5 +1 = 6; P2 total: 5 +1 = 6

Case (A0, A1):
- P1: A0 → +1 from P2
- P2: A1 → pays 1 → so gets -1 from P1
→ P1: 0 (base) +1 = 1; P2: 3 (base) -1 = 2

Case (A1, A0):
- P1: A1 → pays 1 → gets -1
- P2: A0 → gets +1
→ P1: 3 -1 = 2; P2: 0 +1 = 1

Case (A1, A1):
- P1: A1 → pays 1 → -1
- P2: A1 → pays 1 → -1
→ P1: 3 -1 = 2; P2: 3 -1 = 2

So the **new payoff matrix under C1** is:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | (6, 6)   | (1, 2)   |
| A1     | (2, 1)   | (2, 2)   |

Ah! So now, **mutual A0 gives (6,6)** — better than before, and (A0,A0) is now **strictly dominant** in a way?

Check best responses.

For P1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 6 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A1

So **no dominant strategy**.

But let’s see the **Nash equilibria**.

- (A0, A0): P1 gets 6, best response to P2=A0? Yes (6 > 2). P2: 6 > 1 → yes. So Nash.
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 2, best response to P2=A1? P1 can deviate to A0 → gets 1 < 2 → no better. So yes, best response. Similarly for P2. So (A1,A1) is also Nash.
- (A0,A1): P1 gets 1, can deviate to A1 → get 2 > 1 → so not equilibrium
- (A1,A0): P1 gets 2, can deviate to A0 → get 6 > 2 → no

So only pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But now, **(A0,A0) is better** (6 vs 2), so **if players can coordinate**, they should pick A0.

But now, **P1 is the proposer of C1**, so P1 wants to approve it — but the question is: **should P1 approve C1?**

But we are P1 — we care about **maximizing our total points over the game** (including any contract effects).

So under C1:
- If both choose A0 → we get 6
- If both choose A1 → we get 2
- But we don't control the other player.

But we can **influence** behavior via the contract.

Now let’s look at **C2**, proposed by Player 2.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

So:
- A0 → +1 from other player
- A1 → 0 transfer

So **only A0** gives a bonus.

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix under C2**:

For any action:
- If you choose A0 → +1 from opponent
- If you choose A1 → 0 net transfer

So total payoff:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2 gets +1 if P2=A0) | A1 (P2 gets 0) |
|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| A0     | (5+1, 5+1) = (6,6)         | (0+1, 3+0) = (1,3) |
| A1     | (3+0, 0+1) = (3,1)         | (3+0, 3+0) = (3,3) |

So new matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | (6,6)    | (1,3)    |
| A1     | (3,1)    | (3,3)    |

Now analyze best responses:

For P1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 6 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So again, no dominant strategy.

Nash equilibria:
- (A0,A0): P1 (6 > 3), P2 (6 > 1) → Yes
- (A1,A1): P1 (3 = 3, so indifferent; can’t gain), P2 (3 = 3) → yes
- (A0,A1): P1 gets 1, can deviate to A1 → get 3 > 1 → not NE
- (A1,A0): P1 gets 3, can deviate to A0 → get 6 > 3 → not NE

So again, (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are NE.

But now: compare the **payoffs for P1** under different outcomes.

Let’s see the **expected payoff for P1** under each contract **if both players are rational and the game reaches equilibrium**, but since there are two equilibria, we must consider which one is more likely.

But the **key difference** between C1 and C2 is:

- In **C1**, A1 causes **a cost** for the player (they pay 1 to the opponent)
  - So **A1 is penalized**
- In **C2**, A1 has no cost — but A0 gives a bonus

So **C1 makes A1 less attractive**, because it costs 1 to play A1.

But **C2 makes A0 more attractive**, because it pays 1.

Which contract **better increases the chance that both players play A0**?

Because (A0,A0) gives **our highest possible payoff**: 6 in both cases.

But let’s compute **our expected payoff**, assuming **players play a mixed strategy**, or **best respond**, but in equilibria.

But since both contracts lead to multiple equilibria, we want to **maximize the likelihood of (A0,A0)**.

But we are **Player 1**, and we want to **maximize our points**.

So consider this: **in C1**, the payoff for choosing A1 is only 2, while A0 gets 6 in mutual A0, or 1 if opponent plays A1.

But under C1, **if both play A0**, we get **6**.

Under C2, same: 6.

But under C1, **if we play A1**, we only get 2 in best case (if opponent plays A1), but in C2, if we play A1, we get 3 if opponent plays A1.

Wait — big difference!

In **C1**:
- If P2 plays A1, and we play A1 → we get **2**
- But in **C2**, same → we get **3**

So **C2 gives better payoff for playing A1 when opponent plays A1**

But more importantly: in **C1**, playing A1 is penalized — even if opponent does A1, we get only 2, while in C2, we get 3.

But in **C1**, the **payoff for A0 when opponent plays A1** is only **1** — worse than C2's 1? Wait:

- C1: (A0,A1) → P1 gets 1
- C2: (A0,A1) → P1 gets 1 → same

But C1:
- (A1,A1) → 2
- C2: (A1,A1) → 3

So **C1 is worse than C2 for us if we end up in (A1,A1)**.

But (A1,A1) gives only 3 in base, now only 3 or 2 with contract.

But under C1, **(A1,A1) gives only 2**, under C2 gives 3.

So **if the game ends up in (A1,A1)**, we get less under C1.

But also: under C1, **mutual A0 gives 6**, same as C2.

So the **only difference** is in the (A1,A1) outcome: C1 gives us 2, C2 gives us 3.

Moreover, the **best response** structure.

But let’s consider **rationality and coordination**.

**In C1**, if both players **anticipate** that the other might play A1, then:

- In (A0,A1): P1 gets 1 (from A0) vs 2 (from A1) → prefers A1
- So **P1 has incentive to deviate from A0 to A1 if opponent is playing A1**

But in C2, same: from (A0,A1), P1 gets 1 vs 3 → still prefers A1.

So both contracts have the same **incentive to deviate** when opponent plays A1.

But in **C1**, if both players are rational and fear being exploited, they might both play A1 — but in C1, playing A1 gives only 2, while in C2 it gives 3.

So **C1 makes A1 worse** — so **less likely** that both play A1.

But wait: in C1, the **payoff for A1 is low**, so if a player is uncertain, they might avoid A1.

But more importantly: **C1 gives a punishment for A1**, but **C2 gives a reward for A0**.

But the **key difference** is in **how much it incentivizes A0 relative to A1**.

Let’s compute the **expected payoff under symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium** for both contracts.

But we don't need to go that far — we are **Player 1** and want to **maximize our expected payoff**, and the contract is **selected if enough approvals**.

But we only vote on whether to **approve** or not.

But the question is: **should we approve C1? Should we approve C2?**

We are **Player 1**, so we can **propose C1**, but we must vote on both.

Note: C1 is **proposed by us**, and C2 by Player 2.

We are to **approve or reject** each contract **independently**, based on whether it helps **our own expected total points**.

We must **maximize our total points**.

So we need to evaluate: **under each contract**, what are the **likely outcomes**, and which one **gives us higher expected payoff**?

---

### **Compare C1 and C2 from Player 1’s viewpoint**

Let’s think about **which contract makes mutual A0 more stable**.

In both contracts, mutual A0 is a NE.

But in **C1**, if a player plays A1, they **pay 1 to the other player**.

So if you play A1, even if opponent plays A1, you get **only 2**, while in C2 you get **3**.

Also, if **you play A1 and opponent plays A0**, you get 2 in C1, 3 in C2.

So **C1 gives lower payoff for playing A1** in all cases.

This **reduces temptation to deviate to A1**.

Moreover, since **A0 is rewarded in both**, but **A1 is punished only in C1**, **C1 makes mutual A0 more stable**.

Now consider **C2**: A1 is **not penalized** — it just doesn't get rewarded.

So **A1 is not punished**, so players may be more willing to play A1, even if it leads to lower total.

But in **C1**, playing A1 is **costly** — so it’s less likely.

So **C1 increases the likelihood of mutual A0**, while C2 does not.

But what about **when both play A1**?

- In C1: we get **2**
- In C2: we get **3**

But in C1, (A1,A1) is **worse for us**, and **less likely** due to punishment.

In C2, (A1,A1) is **better for us**, but **more likely to happen**? Not necessarily — both contracts have two equilibria.

But **C1** **punishes** A1, so players may **avoid A1**, so mutual A0 is **more likely**.

But let’s **simulate a simple case**.

Suppose both players are rational and try to coordinate on the best mutual outcome.

In C2, if both play A0 → get 6.

If both play A1 → get 3.

But **C2 doesn’t penalize A1**, so if a player thinks the other might play A1, they can **play A1 and get 3**, which is better than getting 1 by playing A0.

So **in C2, (A1,A1) is more attractive**?

No — (A0,A0) is better.

But **in C2**, in (A1,A1), we get 3, which is **better than the 2 in C1** — but **only if we end up in (A1,A1)**.

But **is (A1,A1) more likely under C2** than under C1?

- In C1: (A1,A1) gives only 2 → so **less desirable**
- In C2: (A1,A1) gives 3 → more desirable

So **C2 makes (A1,A1) more likely**.

But (A0,A0) is **always better**.

So **both contracts still have (A0,A0) as a better equilibrium**.

But the question is: **which equilibrium is more likely to be played?**

In C1, because playing A1 is **costly**, players are **more likely to avoid A1**, so **(A0,A0) is more likely**.

In C2, playing A1 is **not punished**, so **players may coordinate on (A1,A1)** if they fear being exploited.

But since **(A0,A0) is better**, rational players should **prefer it** if they can coordinate.

But the **problem is risk**: if you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get only 1, which is worse than getting 3 from playing A1 yourself.

So in both contracts, the **risk** is symmetric.

But **in C1**, the **penalty for A1** makes it less appealing, so **both players may be more cautious about deviating to A1**, so **(A0,A0) is more robust**.

In fact, in C1, **the (A1,A1) equilibrium is strictly worse** for both players than in C2.

In C2, (A1,A1) gives 3 each — better than C1’s 2.

But in C1, the **difference between (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)** is larger: 6 vs 2 → difference of 4

In C2: 6 vs 3 → difference of 3

So **in C1, the gain from coordination is larger**, so **more incentive to coordinate on A0**

Moreover, **in C1, playing A1 is actively punished**, so players have **less incentive to play A1**.

Thus, **C1 makes mutual A0 more likely**, and thus our expected payoff **should be higher under C1** than under C2.

But let’s compare **our expected payoff under symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Assume both players use the same mixed strategy, and play A0 with probability p.

We’ll compute the **expected payoff for P1** under each contract, assuming **mixed strategy equilibrium**, and compare.

But since the other player is also rational, we should use **symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

---

#### **Under C1: Symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**

Let p = P(P2 plays A0)

P1's expected payoff:
- A0: p*(6) + (1-p)*(1) = 6p + 1 - p = 5p + 1
- A1: p*(2) + (1-p)*(2) = 2

Set equal for indifference:
5p + 1 = 2 → 5p = 1 → p = 0.2

So in equilibrium, P2 plays A0 with probability 0.2, A1 with 0.8

Then P1’s expected payoff = 2 (since A1 gives 2, and we’re indifferent)

Wait — no: at equilibrium, P1 is indifferent, so any p is best response — but we set p such that P1 is indifferent.

So when **P2 plays A0 with p=0.2**, P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

So **P1 will play A0 with probability 0.2** to make P2 indifferent?

Wait — we need **mutual indifference**.

In symmetric equilibrium, let p be the common probability of playing A0.

Then for P1:
- EU(A0) = p * 6 + (1-p) * 1 = 6p + 1 - p = 5p + 1
- EU(A1) = p * 2 + (1-p) * 2 = 2

Set equal: 5p + 1 = 2 → 5p = 1 → p = 0.2

So symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium: play A0 with 0.2, A1 with 0.8

Then P1’s expected payoff = EU(A0) = 5*(0.2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

Same as EU(A1) = 2

So **expected payoff under C1: 2**

Now under **C2**:

Payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | (6,6)    | (1,3)    |
| A1     | (3,1)    | (3,3)    |

EU(A0) = p * 6 + (1-p) * 1 = 5p + 1
EU(A1) = p * 3 + (1-p) * 3 = 3

Set equal: 5p + 1 = 3 → 5p = 2 → p = 0.4

So symmetric equilibrium: p = 0.4

Then expected payoff = 3 (from A1) or 5*0.4 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 → yes.

So **under C2, expected payoff = 3**

But under C1, it’s only 2.

But **we care about maximizing our points**, and **C2 gives higher expected payoff (3) than C1 (2)**.

But this is under **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

But is **mixed strategy equilibrium** the only outcome?

In real life, **players might coordinate on the better outcome**.

But the game doesn’t have a focal point yet.

But **C2 gives higher expected payoff** than C1 in equilibrium.

But wait — is that the right way?

In **C1**, the equilibrium gives us **2**, but **(A0,A0)** is a safe Nash equilibrium, giving 6.

In **C2**, the equilibrium gives 3, but (A0,A0) also gives 6.

But why does the mixed strategy equilibrium give lower payoff? Because players mix to avoid being exploited.

But **if both players play A0**, they get 6 — better than 2 or 3.

So **why would they not coordinate on A0?**

Because of **risk**: if you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get only 1.

But in **C1**, if opponent plays A1, and you play A0, you get 1 — same as in C2.

But in C1, if opponent plays A1 and you play A1, you get 2 — while in C2 you get 3.

So in C2, you are **better off playing A1 if opponent plays A1**, so **there is a stronger incentive to play A1**.

But in C1, **playing A1 always gives less**, so **players are more cautious**.

But the **expected payoff in symmetric mixed equilibrium** is **higher in C2 (3) than in C1 (2)**.

But is **mixed strategy equilibrium** the only outcome? No — **players can coordinate on (A0,A0)**.

But how?

The game is symmetric, and (A0,A0) gives 6 for both, which is better than any mixed outcome.

So **if players can coordinate**, they will play (A0,A0).

But **can they?** Only if they **both prefer it**.

But in **C2**, if you are not sure, you might play A1 to avoid getting 1.

But **in C1**, the **penalty for A1 makes it worse**, so you’re more likely to **avoid A1**, so more likely to **coordinate on A0**.

In fact, in C1, **since A1 is costly**, and A0 is rewarded, **(A0,A0) is more credible**.

Moreover, **if both players believe the other will play A0**, then both get 6 — better than anything else.

So **C1 makes coordination on A0 more likely**.

But in C2, playing A1 gives 3, so if you think the other might deviate to A1, you get 3 instead of 1, so you're not hurt as much.

But still — **6 is better than 3**.

So **the optimal outcome is still (A0,A0)**.

But **the contract that makes (A0,A0) more likely to be played will maximize our payoff**.

Now, **C1 penalizes A1**, so **it reduces the incentive to play A1**.

C2 does not penalize A1, so **A1 is not worse than before**.

So **C1 is better for promoting A0**.

Moreover, **C1 is proposed by us**, so we want to **increase the chance that it is approved**.

But more importantly: in **C1**, **if both players play A0**, we get **6**.

In **C2**, same.

But in **C1**, if we play A0 and opponent plays A1, we get only 1 — same as C2.

But in **C1**, if we play A1, we get 2 if opponent plays A1 — but in C2, we get 3.

So if we **end up in (A1,A1)**, we get **less under C1**.

But **we prefer (A0,A0)**.

Now, crucially: **C1 penalizes A1, so both players will be more likely to play A0**.

Thus, **the probability of (A0,A0) is higher under C1**.

Since (A0,A0) gives us 6, and (A1,A1) gives us 2 (C1) or 3 (C2), and other outcomes give 1 or lower, we want to **maximize the probability of (A0,A0)**.

Even though the **mixed equilibrium** gives higher expected payoff in C2, that's because it assumes players won't coordinate.

But **rational players should coordinate on the best outcome** if they can.

And **C1 makes coordination on A0 easier**.

In fact, in **C1**, the **incentive to play A0 is stronger** — you get +1, and A1 is costly.

In **C2**, you only get +1 for A0, but A1 is not punished.

So **C1 is a better contract for promoting mutual A0**.

Moreover, **C1 is proposed by us**, so we want to **approve it**.

But should we approve C2?

C2 also allows mutual A0, and if both play A0, we get 6 — good.

But C2 **does not penalize A1**, so it is **less effective at preventing suboptimal coordination** on (A1,A1).

Therefore, **C2 has weaker incentives for cooperation**.

Thus, **C1 is better for our payoff**.

But our task is to **approve the contract if it is good for us**.

So we should approve **C1** and **not approve C2**?

Wait — but C2 is **proposed by Player 2**, so it might be bad for us.

Let's see: in C2, if both play A0, we get 6.

But if we play A0 and they play A1, we get 1 — same as C1.

But in C2, if they play A1 and we play A1, we get 3 — better than C1’s 2.

But we prefer A0.

But the **key point** is: **in C2, the other player is less likely to play A0**, because playing A1 is not punished.

Whereas in C1, playing A1 is punished, so player 2 is more likely to avoid A1, so more likely to play A0.

Therefore, **under C1, our expected payoff is higher**.

Moreover, if both players are rational, they will see that in C1, mutual A0 is better and more stable.

So we should **approve only C1**.

But wait — the contract selection is by **approval voting**, and the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

We want to **maximize our expected points**, which depends on which contract is selected.

We are to **approve or reject each contract**.

If we approve C1 and reject C2, then only C1 has approval.

So C1 is selected.

If we approve both, then both have approvals, so one is chosen at random.

But we want to **maximize our expected points**.

So we need to compare:

- If we approve only C1: then C1 is selected with probability 1 → we get expected payoff under C1

- If we approve both: then C1 and C2 are both approved, so winner is chosen uniformly at random → probability 0.5 for C1, 0.5 for C2

- If we approve neither: game is played without contract → we get expected payoff under base game.

But we are not told to maximize over contract choice — we are to decide whether to approve each contract.

But our goal is to **maximize our total points received in the game**, so we should choose approvals to **maximize the expected value of our payoff**.

So let’s compute the **expected payoff under each option**.

First, **base game (no contract):**

Payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | (5,5)    | (0,3)    |
| A1     | (3,0)    | (3,3)    |

Symmetric mixed strategy NE: let p = P(P2 plays A0)

EU(A0) = 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p

EU(A1) = 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

Then EU = 3

So expected payoff under base: 3

Now, under C1: we computed mixed strategy NE: expected payoff 2

But wait, is that the only outcome? No — players can coordinate.

But in the absence of communication, they might play mixed strategy.

But in the absence of contract, they might also coordinate on (A0,A0) or (A1,A1).

But (A1,A1) gives 3, same as mixed strategy.

(A0,A0) gives 5, but only if both play A0.

But if one plays A0 and other A1, you get 0.

So risk.

In fact, (A0,A0) is **more attractive**, so it is a focal point.

But in the standard analysis, mixed strategy gives 3, same as (A1,A1).

But (A0,A0) gives 5, so it is better.

But if players can coordinate, they will.

But here, there is no communication, so we have to assume they play Nash.

But in this game, (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are both NE, so it's hard to predict.

But to be conservative, we use mixed strategy NE.

So base: expected payoff = 3

C1: mixed strategy NE: 2

C2: mixed strategy NE: 3

Now, if we approve C1 only: C1 is selected, we get 2

If we approve both: then with 0.5 chance C1 (2), 0.5 chance C2 (3) → expected = 0.5*2 + 0.5*3 = 2.5

If we approve neither: no contract → base game → 3

But 3 > 2.5 > 2

So best to **reject both contracts**.

But then we get 3 from base game.

But in base game, we can achieve 5 if both play A0.

But in mixed strategy equilibrium, we get 3.

But if we reject both contracts, the game is played without contract, so **we get the base payoff**.

But in base game, (A0,A0) is a NE and gives 5, which is higher than 3.

So if both play A0, we get 5.

But is (A0,A0) stable?

- If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A1

So (A0,A0) is NE.

But it's not as strong as in C1.

But if both players are rational and can coordinate, they will play A0.

So perhaps in practice, they will.

To maximize expected payoff, we need the **highest possible expected payoff**.

But we don't know the other player's behavior.

But if we assume that players will play a symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, then:

- Base game: 3
- C1: 2
- C2: 3

So C1 is worse.

But if we think that (A0,A0) is more likely to be played under a contract that rewards it, then C1 might be better.

But in mixed strategy, it's not.

Given that, and since C1 reduces our expected payoff in mixed strategy from 3 to 2, while C2 keeps it at 3, we should **not approve C1**.

But C1 is proposed by us, yet it's worse.

And C2 is proposed by Player 2, but it gives us 3, same as base.

So both contracts are at best as good as base.

But with C1, we get 2 in mixed strategy, which is worse.

Therefore, we should **not approve C1**.

But C2 gives us 3, same as base.

If we approve C2, then if it is selected (with probability 0.5 if we approve both), we get 3.

But if we approve only C2, we get 3.

If we approve neither, we get 3.

So same.

But if we approve C2, we increase the chance of C2 being selected, but it doesn't help.

So to maximize our points, we should **not approve any contract**, because C1 is bad, and C2 is no better than base.

But is that true?

In C2, if mutual A0 is played, we get 6.

In base, if mutual A0 is played, we get 5.

So if C2 makes mutual A0 more likely, then it's better.

But in mixed strategy, we get 3.

But in practice, if C2 is in place, and both players know it, they might coordinate on A0.

Similarly for C1.

But the contract might influence behavior.

But in the mixed strategy analysis, C1 gives lower expected payoff.

Moreover, C1 has a disadvantage: if both play A1, we get 2, while in base or C2 we get 3.

So C1 is worse in that outcome.

Given that, and since our goal is to maximize points, and C1 is worse in the mixed strategy equilibrium, we should not approve C1.

For C2, it's the same as base in mixed strategy, so no harm.

But no gain.

So we can approve C2.

But wait, if we approve C2, and it is selected, we get 3, same as base.

So no benefit.

But if we approve neither, and base is played, we also get 3.

So same.

But the game might go to (A0,A0) in base game with higher probability.

So to be safe, we should not approve any contracts.

But the contract is selected only if it has approvals.

If we approve C2, then C2 might be selected.

But in C2, if both play A0, we get 6, which is better than 5 in base.

So if C2 makes coordination on A0 more likely, then it's better.

In C2, A0 is rewarded, but not A1 punished.

In C1, A1 is punished.

So C1 is better for promoting A0.

But C1 has a lower mixed strategy payoff.

Given the complexity, but since the instruction is to maximize our points, and the mixed strategy analysis shows C1 gives 2 < 3, and C2 gives 3 = base, we should not approve C1, and may approve C2.

But to be conservative, let's assume that the other player will play a best response.

But the safest is to not approve C1, since it harms us.

For C2, it might help.

But in the absence of clear advantage, and since C2 is proposed by Player 2, and we are Player 1, we might not want to approve a contract that benefits the other player more, but the contract is per player, not per player.

I think the best is to approve C2, as it doesn't hurt and might help.

But let's go back to the mixed strategy: under C2, expected payoff 3, same as base.

So no difference.

So we can approve C2.

But we can also not.

But to maximize chances, since C2 might make mutual A0 more likely, and that gives us 6 > 5, it's a good thing.

So we should approve C2.

For C1, it makes mutual A0 possible, but also makes (A1,A1) worse, but still, expected payoff is lower.

So for us, we should **disapprove C1** and **approve C2**.

But in C2, the other player is not penalized for A1, so they might be more likely to play A1.

But in C1, they are penalized, so less likely.

So C1 is better for promoting A0.

I think the correct answer is to approve C1, but the analysis says mixed strategy is worse.

But in reality, if both players know the contract, they will coordinate on (A0,A0) if possible.

And in C1, the incentive to play A0 is stronger.

So expected payoff will be close to 6.

In base, it might be 5.

In C2, it might be 6.

 so both C1 and C2 are good.

C1 might be slightly better because of the penalty.

But since C1 is our proposal, and it's a good contract, we should approve it.

And for C2, it's not us.

But in C2, if we play A0 and they play A1, we get 1, same as C1.

But if they play A1 and we play A1, we get 3 in C2, 2 in C1.

So C2 is better for A1.

But we prefer A0.

 given that, and since C1 has the penalty, it's better.

I think the intended answer is to approve C1, disapprove C2.

But from the mixed strategy, C1 is bad.

 after careful thought, I think the best is to accept that in the mixed strategy equilibrium, C1 gives lower expected payoff, so we should not approve it.

But in the base game, mixed strategy gives 3, C1 gives 2, C2 gives 3.

So only if we can coordinate on A0, then C1 and C2 are good.

Since the contract might help coordination, but in mixed strategy analysis, it's not.

Given that the other player might not be with us, and we want to maximize points, and C1 is worse, I think we should not approve C1.

For C2, it's not worse, so we can approve it.

But to not change anything, we can approve C2.

However, let's look at the contract design.

In C1, if we choose A1, we pay 1 to the other player.

In C2, no.

So for us, if we play A1, in C1 we pay 1, in C2 we keep the base.

So C2 is better for us if we play A1.

So overall, C2 is better for us.

Therefore, we should approve C2, disapprove C1.

 so final answer.

{"C1": false, "C2": true} 

But let's box it.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to decide whether to sign the contract.

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

The base game is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

This is similar to a coordination game with a "temptation" to defect (choose A1 when opponent plays A0), but note that if both choose A1, both get 3 — same as if one chooses A1 and the other A0 (but outcomes differ per player).

In the base game, notice:
- If both choose A0: (5,5) → best for both.
- If one chooses A0 and other A1: the A1 player gets 3, the A0 player gets 0.
- If both choose A1: (3,3)

This is **not** a Prisoner’s Dilemma, because in PD:
- Defection (A1) gives higher payoff than cooperation (A0) **regardless of opponent’s action**.
Let’s check:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → so better to play A0.
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1: A0 → 0, A1 → 3 → so better to play A1.

So P1's best response depends on what P2 does. So it's a **coordination game with a conflict of interest** — not strictly a PD.

But note: if both play A0, they get 5 — best outcome.
But if one deviates to A1 while the other plays A0, that player gets 3 (less than 5), but the other gets 0 — so it's actually **harmful** to the other player.

But here’s the key: If you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0. So you *lose a lot* if your opponent defects.

So both players have an incentive to coordinate on (A0, A0) to get 5 each.

But if you’re unsure about the other’s action, it's risky to play A0.

Let’s look for Nash equilibria.

- (A0, A0): Is it a NE?
  - If P1 deviates to A1 while P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 3 < 5 → no incentive.
  - Similarly, P2 won’t deviate.
  → So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

- (A1, A1): If P1 deviates to A0, while P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0 < 3 → no incentive. Same for P2.
  → So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 → if P1 switches to A1 → gets 3 → better → not NE.
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 0 → if P2 switches to A1 → gets 3 → better → not NE.

So there are **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

Now, since both players are rational and have common knowledge, they might coordinate on (A0, A0), but both are uncertain.

But without coordination, people might fall into the (A1, A1) outcome when they are risk-averse.

But now comes the **contract**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since there are two players, "drawn equally from the other players" means:
- If you choose A0: you gain +1, and the other player loses 1 (since it's drawn from them).
- If you choose A1: you lose -1, and the other player gains +1.

So the **contract shifts net payoffs**.

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix with contract**.

Assume the contract is signed by **both players**. The contract is active only if **both** sign.

So we’re assuming we’re deciding whether to sign — **if we sign, the other player must also sign** for it to take effect. But since the option is to sign or not, and the contract only applies if both sign, we need to consider the strategic effect.

But in the current step, we are only deciding whether to sign — i.e., is signing in our interest?

So we have to ask: **Does signing the contract improve my expected payoff, assuming the other player may or may not sign?**

But the contract is **only active if both sign**. So the actual payoff depends on whether the other player signs.

So let’s think about the **four cases**:

1. I sign, other signs → contract active → adjusted payoffs.
2. I sign, other does not → contract inactive → base game.
3. I don’t sign, other signs → contract inactive → base game.
4. I don’t sign, other doesn’t sign → contract inactive → base game.

So **only in case 1 is the contract in effect.**

Therefore, whether I sign depends on the **expected payoff** from signing vs. not, considering my belief about the other player’s behavior.

But — we are not told anything about the other player’s preferences or behavior.

However, the contract is **proposed by Player 1**, and it says it was selected via approval voting — meaning Player 1 supports it.

But the other player’s decision is unknown.

### Key point: Since we are Player 1, and the contract is proposed by us, we can only **sign or not sign**.

But the **game outcome depends on joint signing**.

So we must ask: **Does signing the contract increase my expected payoff, assuming that the other player may or may not sign?**

But we lack information about the other player’s strategy.

However, we can look at the **effect on incentives**.

Let’s analyze: What happens **if we both sign**?

Then the contract applies to both, so we can compute the **new payoff matrix with contract**.

Note: The contract **changes the payoffs per choice**, and it applies **regardless of what the other player does**.

So for each combination of actions, we compute:

- Base payoff (from game table)
- Plus: additional contract payment based on my action
  - If I play A0 → I gain +1
  - If I play A1 → I lose -1

But the payment is **drawn from the other player**, so the magnitude is +1 for A0, -1 for A1, **but only if the contract is active**.

So let’s compute the **contract-adjusted payoff matrix** (for Player 1):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5+1, 5-1) = (6,4) | (0+1, 3-1) = (1,2) |
| **P1: A1** | (3-1, 0+1) = (2,1) | (3-1, 3-1) = (2,2) |

Wait — careful: when P1 plays A0, gets +1. P2 gets -1 (since payment is drawn from them).

Similarly, when P1 plays A1, pays -1, so P2 gains +1.

So yes:

- (A0, A0): P1: 5 + 1 = 6, P2: 5 - 1 = 4
- (A0, A1): P1: 0 + 1 = 1, P2: 3 - 1 = 2
- (A1, A0): P1: 3 - 1 = 2, P2: 0 + 1 = 1
- (A1, A1): P1: 3 - 1 = 2, P2: 3 - 1 = 2

So now the adjusted game (contract active) has the following matrix for Player 1:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 6      | 1      |
| **P1: A1** | 2      | 2      |

Now, let’s analyze **Player 1’s incentives in the contract game**.

For Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: best response is A0 (6 > 2)
- If P2 plays A1: best response is A0 (1 > 2? No! 1 < 2) → so A1 is better (2 > 1)

Wait:
- P2 plays A1 → P1 gets: A0 → 1, A1 → 2 → so prefer A1.

So best responses:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 plays A0
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 plays A1

So **no dominant strategy**, but P1’s best response is to match P2.

Now, what are the Nash equilibria in the contract-adjusted game?

Check pure strategy Nash equilibria:

1. (A0, A0): P1 wants to deviate? If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 6 from A0, 2 from A1 → doesn't deviate. P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 4 from A0, 2 from A1 → prefers A0 → so (A0, A0) is NE.

2. (A1, A1): P1: gets 2 from A1, 1 from A0 → no incentive to deviate. P2: gets 2 from A1, 1 from A0 → no incentive → so (A1, A1) is also a NE.

3. (A0, A1): P1 gets 1, but if deviates to A1 → gets 2 > 1 → so deviates → not NE.
4. (A1, A0): P1 gets 2, but if deviates to A0 → gets 6 > 2 → deviates → not NE.

So two pure NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

But now, compare to base game: same NEs.

But now, what is different?

In the **contracted game**, if you play A0, you get +1, even if the other player plays A1. But in that case, you get only 1 (from base: 0 + 1), but if you play A1, you get 2 (from base: 3 - 1 = 2), so you're better off playing A1 when opponent plays A1.

But here’s the **key insight**:

- In the **base game**, playing A0 when opponent plays A1 gives you 0 (bad), which is much worse than playing A1 (3).
- In the **contracted game**, playing A0 when opponent plays A1 gives you 1 — still worse than A1 (2), but **better than 0**.

Similarly, in the base game, playing A1 when opponent plays A0 gives 3, but in contract, it gives 2 → worse.

But more importantly: **The contract makes A0 more attractive relative to A1 in some cases**?

Wait — actually, in base game:
- A0 vs A1 when other plays A0: A0=5, A1=3 → A0 better
- A0 vs A1 when other plays A1: A0=0, A1=3 → A1 better

In contract game:
- A0 vs A1 when other plays A0: A0=6, A1=2 → A0 better
- A0 vs A1 when other plays A1: A0=1, A1=2 → A1 better

So **the relative difference is smaller** when A0 is better (from 5 vs 3 → diff 2, to 6 vs 2 → diff 4), and when A1 is better (3 vs 0 → diff 3, to 2 vs 1 → diff 1). 

So actually, the **contract makes A0 more attractive when the other plays A0**, but **makes A1 relatively less attractive when the other plays A1**?

Wait: the gap between A0 and A1 is wider when A0 is correct? But in the symmetric case, it's worse for A1.

But more importantly: **does the contract help someone like us (Player 1) get better expected payoff?**

Now, here’s a critical point: the **contract is only active if both sign**.

So if I sign, the contract only applies if the other player also signs.

If the other player doesn’t sign, then the base game applies.

So I need to ask: **What is my expected payoff under each choice (sign or not sign), assuming that the other player might sign or not?**

But I don’t know their strategy.

However, notice that the contract **benefits A0 players and penalizes A1 players**, but only from the other player.

But since it's symmetric, and the proposal came from Player 1, **does the contract benefit Player 1?**

Let’s suppose the other player is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s consider: **Would the other player want to sign the contract?**

Player 2's adjusted payoffs (in contract case):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (4,6) → wait no: P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 4? Earlier I had:
- (A0, A0): P1 gets 6, P2 gets 4
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 2
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 1
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 2

So P2's payoffs:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 4      | 2      |
| **P1: A1** | 1      | 2      |

Similarly, P2’s best responses:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 4 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A1

Same as before.

So in the contract game, **Player 2 also has two pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)**.

Now, compare expected payoffs.

But again, we need common knowledge.

Now, suppose **both of us are rational and know the game**, and we can coordinate.

But the contract is a **way to change incentives**.

Let’s ask: **Does the contract make (A0, A0) more stable or attractive?**

In the **base game**:
- (A0, A0): each gets 5
- (A1, A1): each gets 3

So (A0, A0) is better for both — it's Pareto superior.

But it's risky: if I expect the other to play A0, I want to play A0 (5 > 3). But if I think they might play A1, I’d rather play A1 (3 > 0).

So the issue is **coordination**.

Now, in the **contracted game**:
- (A0, A0): both get 6 → better than 5
- (A1, A1): both get 2 → worse than 3

So the contract makes (A0, A0) **better** (6 > 5), and (A1, A1) **worse** (2 < 3). So the contract makes the good outcome better and the bad outcome worse.

This **reduces the temptation to play A1**, and **increases the incentive to play A0**.

So **if both sign**, we both want to coordinate on A0.

But in the **base game**, from (A1, A1), both players get 3 — greater than 2 — so they might "lodge" at A1.

But with the contract, (A1, A1) gives only 2 — so it’s worse than before.

So the contract **eliminates the (A1, A1) Nash equilibrium as a stable outcome**? No — it’s still a NE, but worse for both.

But now, in the contract game, **only (A0, A0) gives a higher payoff than base game**.

For us (P1), if we sign and the other signs, we expect to get **at least 2**, but if we coordinate on (A0, A0), we get 6.

But will the other player sign?

Let’s suppose the other player reasons the same way.

They might say: "if I sign, then I stand to gain 6 if we both play A0, but only 2 if we both play A1. Since (A0,A0) is better for both, I want to sign and coordinate."

But what if they don’t know if I’ll sign?

But since the contract is proposed by P1, and we are deciding now, and the other player is rational, they might realize that signing the contract makes (A0,A0) more attractive.

More importantly: **By signing the contract, I make it more beneficial for both to coordinate on A0**, because:
- We both get +1 each when playing A0 (but this is offset — only one gets +1, other loses 1)
Wait: when I play A0, I get +1, but the other loses 1. So if we both play A0, I get +1, they get -1.

Wait — that can’t be right.

Hold on.

Ah! Here is a **crucial point**:

The contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), **drawn equally from the other players**."

So if **both** choose A0, then:
- I get +1 (because I chose A0)
- The other player gets +1 (because they chose A0)
- But where does the +1 come from? It must come from the other player — and there's only one other player.

But it says "drawn equally from the other players" → if there is only one other player, then **they must pay 1**, and that goes to me.

But the other player also receives +1, so they must be paid 1, but who pays it?

Ah — here's the **problem**: if both play A0, then each is supposed to get +1, but to pay for it, the other player must pay 1.

But if both are supposed to be paid 1, but the only other player is paying 1, then someone must pay 2, but only one other player.

So **this is inconsistent**.

Wait — let’s read carefully:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if I play A0 → I receive 1 → comes from other players.

"drawn equally" → so if two other players, each pays 0.5; but only one other player → that player pays 1.

Similarly, if I play A1 → I pay 1 → distributed equally among other players → so the other player receives 1.

Now, if **both** play A0:
- I get +1 → paid by the other player (who pays 1)
- The other player gets +1 → paid by me (who pays 1)
- So I pay 1, get 1 → net 0
- Other player pays 1, gets 1 → net 0

But the contract says "additional payment" — so the **net effect is zero** for both if both play A0.

Wait — but then where does the +1 come from?

Ah! **There is no net money creation.** The contract is a redistribution.

So:

- If I play A0 and other plays A1:
  - I get +1 (from other player)
  - Other player gets -1 (pays me)

- If I play A1 and other plays A0:
  - I pay -1 (to the other player)
  - Other player gets +1 (from me)

- If both play A0:
  - I get +1 (from other) and pay -1 (to other)? No — the payment for me being A0 comes from the other player.

The system is: **each player's extra payment is funded by the other players**, based on their actions.

So for each player, the **net change due to contract** is:

- If a player chooses A0: they gain +1, but must be paid by others → amount paid by others is +1 full (since only one other).

- If a player chooses A1: they lose -1, and that -1 is distributed to others.

But **when both play A0**, each player gains +1 (from other), but also is paid by the other? No:

Let’s define:

The total “contract adjustment” for a player is:
- +1 if they play A0
- -1 if they play A1

But where does that +1 or -1 come from?

It is **funded by other players**.

So for the entire system: total sum of contract adjustments over both players:

- If both A0: each has +1 → total +2
- But this must come from somewhere → impossible.

Ah! This is **not possible** — unless there is outside funding.

But the contract says: "drawn equally from the other players" → so if there is only one other player, they must pay the full 1.

But if both play A0, then both want to receive +1 from the other → so the other must pay.

But each player is the “other” for the other.

So for player 1 to get +1 from playing A0, player 2 must pay 1.

For player 2 to get +1 from playing A0, player 1 must pay 1.

So **net: both pay 1 and receive 1 → net zero for both**.

So the contract adjustment **cancels out** if both play A0.

Similarly, if both play A1: each pays -1 → so they each lose 1, but that -1 is distributed to others → so each pays 1, receives 1 → net zero.

If one plays A0 and other A1:
- A0 player gets +1 → paid by A1 player (who pays 1)
- A1 player pays -1 → gives 1 to A0 player → so net, A0 player gains +1, A1 player loses -1 → net transfer of +1 from A1 to A0.

So the **net effect** is:

| P1 | P2 | Contract net (P1) | Contract net (P2) |
|----|----|-------------------|-------------------|
| A0 | A0 | +1 -1? Wait no

Wait, better: the contract adjustment is determined by what you do.

- Your net contract payoff = +1 if you play A0, -1 if you play A1
- But this is **offset by payments from others**.

But in net terms, if both play A0:
- P1: gets +1 (from contract), but as part of "drawn from others", P2 must pay 1 → so P1 gains +1, P2 loses 1
- But P2 also gets +1 (from contract), so must be paid by P1 → P1 loses 1
- So P1: +1 (from contract) -1 (to P2) = 0
- P2: +1 (from contract) -1 (to P1) = 0

So net contract payoff: 0 for both.

Similarly, if both play A1:
- P1: -1 (from contract) → must pay 1 to others
- P2: -1 → must pay 1 to others
- But others are only one: P1 must pay 1 to P2, and P2 must pay 1 to P1
- So P1: -1 (contract) +1 (from P2) = 0
- P2: -1 +1 = 0

Net: 0 for both.

If P1: A0, P2: A1:
- P1: +1 (from contract), so must be paid 1 → P2 pays 1 → P1 gets +1
- P2: -1 (contract), so pays 1 → to whom? Distributed equally to others → only P1 → P2 pays 1 to P1
- So P1: +1 (contract) +1 (from P2) = +2
- P2: -1 (contract) +0? No — P2 pays 1 to P1
- So P2: -1 (contract) -1 (payment) = -2

Wait — this can't be, because contract says "pay an additional payment of 1", distributed to others — so if you pay 1, you lose 1, and others gain.

In this case:
- P1 plays A0 → gets +1 → paid by P2
- P2 plays A1 → pays 1 → distributed to P1 (only other)

So P1: +1 (from contract) +1 (from P2) = +2
P2: -1 (contract) -1 (payment) = -2

Total: +2 -2 = 0 — net zero.

But this is **not symmetric** — the player who plays A0 gets +2, the one who plays A1 gets -2.

But the contract says "drawn equally from the other players" — if there is only one other player, they pay the full amount.

So when P1 plays A0, P2 pays 1.

When P2 plays A1, P2 pays 1 → that 1 is given to P1.

So P1 receives 1 (from contract) + 1 (from P2) = +2

P2 pays 1 (to P1) for P1's contract payment, and also pays 1 (for P2's contract payment) — so total -2.

Yes.

Similarly, if P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0:
- P1: -1 (contract), pays 1 → distributed to P2 → P2 gets 1
- P2: +1 (contract), so P1 pays 1
- So P1: -1 (contract) -1 (payment) = -2
- P2: +1 (contract) +1 (from P1) = +2

So net contract payoffs:

| P1 | P2 | Contract P1 | Contract P2 |
|----|----|-------------|-------------|
| A0 | A0 | 0           | 0           |
| A1 | A1 | 0           | 0           |
| A0 | A1 | +2          | -2          |
| A1 | A0 | -2          | +2          |

Oh! This is **not what I thought earlier**.

I completely misunderstood.

The contract is **not** that you get +1 or lose 1 independently, but rather:

- Your contract payment is:
  - +1 if you play A0
  - -1 if you play A1
- BUT this is funded by the other players.

So if you play A0, you get +1, paid by the other player (since only one).

If you play A1, you pay -1, which is distributed to the other player.

So in cases where actions differ, the player playing A0 **gets +2** (because they get +1 from contract and the other player's payment is 1), and the player playing A1 **gets -2**.

In cases where actions are the same, net contract payoff is 0 for both.

### Final Contract-Adjusted Payoff Matrix (Player 1)

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5+0, 5+0) = (5,5) | (0+2, 3-2) = (2,1) |
| **P1: A1** | (3-2, 0+2) = (1,2) | (3+0, 3+0) = (3,3) |

Let’s verify:

- (A0, A0): both play A0 → contract net for P1: 0 → total 5
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +1 from contract; P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 1 to P1 → so P1 gets +2 total → 0+2=2; P2: contract -2 → 3-2=1
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → gets -1 from contract; P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +1 from contract, so P1 must pay 1 to P2 → P1 loses 2 → 3-2=1; P2 gets 0+2=2
- (A1, A1): both play A1 → contract net 0 → 3 each

So matrix for P1:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5      | 2      |
| **P1: A1** | 1      | 3      |

Now, let’s analyze.

P1's best response:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - A0: 5
  - A1: 1 → P1 prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - A0: 2
  - A1: 3 → P1 prefers A1

So best responses:
- P2: A0 → P1: A0
- P2: A1 → P1: A1

So only if P2 plays A0, P1 wants to play A0.

Now, the only pure Nash equilibria are:
- (A0, A0): P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 5, P2 gets 5
  - If P1 deviates to A1: gets 1 < 5 → no
  - If P2 deviates to A1: gets 1 < 5 → no → so NE
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 3
  - If P1 deviates to A0: gets 2 < 3 → no
  - If P2 deviates to A0: gets 2 < 3 → no → so NE

So still two NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But now, the payoffs are:

- (A0, A0): P1 gets 5 (same as base)
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 3 (same as base)

But now, in the case where actions differ:
- P1 gets only 2 if P2 plays A1
- P1 gets 1 if P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A1

So in fact, **the contract has not improved or worsened the base game for Player 1 in any stable outcome**.

But in the mixed case, but still, the outcome when you coordinate on A0 or A1 is unchanged.

But here’s the **key**: in the base game, if you coordinate on A0, you get 5.

In the contract game, if you coordinate on A0, you still get 5.

Similarly for A1.

But the **contract has no effect on symmetric outcomes**.

And when they differ, you get a very bad payoff if you're the A0 player (2), but if you're the A1 player, you get 3.

But in the base game, when they differ:
- If P1 plays A0 and P2 A1: P1 gets 0
- In contract: P1 gets 2 — better!

Similarly, if P1 plays A1 and P2 A0: in base, P1 gets 3; in contract, P1 gets 1 — worse!

So:
- If you are the one who plays A0 while the other plays A1, you get 2 instead of 0 → better.
- If you are the one who plays A1 while the other plays A0, you get 1 instead of 3 → worse.

So the contract **benefits the player who plays A0 when the other plays A1**, and **harms the player who plays A1 when the other plays A0**.

But in equilibrium, both coordinate on the same action.

So **in the symmetric equilibria, the contract has no effect**.

But now, from a strategic point of view, the contract might **increase the risk of not coordinating**, because if there is a small chance the other plays A1,then you might want to play A1, but if you play A1 and the other plays A0, you get only 1, which is bad.

In the base game, you get 3, which is better.

So the contract makes you worse off in the "mismatched" case when you're the A1 player.

And since in the base game, (A0, A0) is better than (A1, A1), but the contract doesn't make (A0, A0) better, it has no effect.

Therefore, **there is no incentive for me to sign the contract**, because:

- If the other player signs, then the game is unchanged in equilibrium outcomes, but in case of mistake, it hurts me if I play A1 while they play A0 (I get 1 instead of 3).
- If the other player does not sign, then the contract is inactive, and I am better off without it.

In fact, by signing, I gain nothing and risk being worse off if we don't coordinate.

Moreover, the other player may not want to sign because they also suffer in the mismatched case if they play A1.

Therefore, **signing the contract does not help me.**

### Final Decision

I should **not sign the contract**.

Let's analyze the situation and implement a strategy for our game.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Payoff Matrix Review
First, let's reexamine the payoff matrix for clarity:

- If both players choose A0: Player 2 gets 5 points, Player 1 gets 5 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If both players choose A1: Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.

#### Proposed Contract
It's noted that Player 1 rejected the proposed contract that would have:
- Added 1 point to a player's score when they choose A0.
- Deducted 1 point from a player's score when they choose A1.

Since the contract is not active, it does not influence the current game.

#### Strategy for Maximizing Points
Let's think about the pure Nash equilibria:
- If both players choose A0: each gets 5 points.
- If both players choose A1: each gets 3 points.
- If the players mismatch: the one who chose A0 gets a lower score (0 or 3), while the other gets the maximum they can get against A1.

The key point is to compare the expected payoffs from mixed strategies vs. pure strategies:

#### Mixed Strategy Consideration
1. **Choosing A0**:
    - If Player 1 plays A0 with probability \( p \) and A1 with probability \( 1 - p \):
        - Expected payoff for Player 2 choosing A0: \( 5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p \)
        - Expected payoff for Player 2 choosing A1: \( 3p + 3(1 - p) = 3 \)

2. **Choosing A1**:
    - We compare payoffs for mixed strategies:
        - Fixed point where it's indifferent to Player 2 if they play A0 or A1:
        - Equate payoffs: \( 5p = 3 \)
        - \( p = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \)

This suggests if Player 1 is playing \((A0, A1)\) with \((0.6, 0.4)\), then Player 2 should be indifferent, leading to a mixed strategy.

To generalize, Player 2 should also derive the same best strategy, considering symmetry and Nash equilibrium insights.

#### Proposed Solution
Given the analyzed payoffs and symmetry, an optimal mixed strategy for Player 2 will be similar, randomized suitably consistent with maximizing and stabilizing payoff against Player 1's probable rational behavior.

### Conclusion
Player 2 should adopt probabilities \( \{0.6: 0.6(A0) + 0.4(A1)\} \):

```json
{"A0": 60, "A1": 40}
```

This mix should help maximize our expected points based on Player 1's rational play model. Using this balance methodically observes empathy considering Player 1's rejections affect strategy equilibrium optimality in rational constraints.

## Step-by-step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

Without the contract, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 5, Other gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, Other gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, Other gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, Other gets 3

### Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- +2 points to any player who chooses A0 (paid by the other player)
- No payment for choosing A1

New payoffs WITH contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 5+2-2 = **5**, Other gets 5+2-2 = **5**
- (A0, A1): I get 0+2 = **2**, Other gets 3-2 = **1**
- (A1, A0): I get 3-2 = **1**, Other gets 0+2 = **2**
- (A1, A1): I get **3**, Other gets **3**

### Step 3: Analyze strategic implications

**Without contract:**
- If I expect the other player to play A0 with probability p, I should play A0 when 5p > 3, i.e., when p > 0.6
- Playing A0 is risky: best case = 5, worst case = 0

**With contract:**
- If I expect the other player to play A0 with probability p, I should play A0 when 3p + 2 > 3 - 2p, i.e., when p > 0.2
- Playing A0 is less risky: best case = 5, worst case = 2 (improved!)

### Step 4: Evaluate the benefits

The contract:
1. **Reduces risk**: The worst-case outcome for playing A0 improves from 0 to 2
2. **Facilitates coordination**: Lowers the threshold for playing A0 from 60% to 20%
3. **Preserves the best outcome**: (A0, A0) still yields 5 points for both players
4. **Is symmetric**: Both players benefit equally from the coordination incentive

### Step 5: Decision

The contract makes it easier to coordinate on the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome by making A0 more attractive and less risky. There's no downside - it only helps avoid the coordination problem. Since the other player proposed this, they likely intend to play A0, making signing even more valuable.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether you should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without the contract)

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

This is a coordination game with two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1), but also some mixed strategy possibilities.

Note:
- If you play A0 and the other plays A0 → you get 5.
- If you play A0 and the other plays A1 → you get 0.
- If you play A1 and the other plays A0 → you get 3.
- If you play A1 and the other plays A1 → you get 3.

So for Player 1, A0 is better only if you think the other player will play A0. A1 is a safe choice giving 3 regardless of the other player's action.

However, if you both coordinate on A0, you get 5 each — better than the 3 from A1-A1. So there is an incentive to coordinate on A0.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract says:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you gain +2 points **from the other player**.
- This 2 points comes **from** the other player, meaning **they lose 2 points**.

But: if **they** choose A0, they also gain +2 — so those 2 come from you.

Important: The contract is **global** — if both players sign, then the contract applies.

The contract is **only active if both players sign**.

So the **contract modifies the game** when signed by both.

We are **considering whether to sign**, knowing that the game proceeds **only if both sign**.

So the effective game under the contract is a modified version of the original, with additional payoffs.

---

### Step 3: Analyze payoffs under the contract

Now, when **both players sign the contract**, the payoffs become:

Let’s recompute the original payoffs, **plus** the contract bonus.

#### Contract effect:
- Any player who chooses A0 gets **+2**, **taken from the other player**.
- So if you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → you get +2 from them, and they get +2 from you → net, you each get +2, but both were "charged" 2 and "paid" 2 → net zero impact on total game, but shifted between players.
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get **+2** from them (since you played A0), but they **don't get anything** because you played A1.
    - So you get +2, they lose 2.
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get nothing (you played A1), but they get +2 (they played A0) **from you** → so you lose 2, they gain 2.
- If both play A1 → no extra payment.

So let’s build the **new payoff matrix** under the contract (both players sign):

|               | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5+2, 5+2) = (7,7) | (0+2, 3-2) = (2,1) |
| **P1: A1**    | (3-2, 0+2) = (1,2) | (3,3)         |

Let’s verify:
- (A0,A0): both get A0 → each gets +2 → so (5+2, 5+2) = (7,7)
- (A0,A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +2; P2 plays A1 → no bonus. But P2 gets **only** their base payoff (3), but since P1 chose A0, P1 **takes 2 from P2** → so P2 gets 3 - 2 = 1, P1 gets 0 + 2 = 2 → (2,1)
- (A1,A0): P1 plays A1 → gets 0 bonus. P2 plays A0 → gets +2, which comes from P1 → so P1’s base is 3, but loses 2 to P2 → 1; P2 gets 0 (base) + 2 = 2 → (1,2)
- (A1,A1): no one plays A0 → no contract payments → (3,3)

So the new payoff matrix under contract:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (7,7)  | (2,1)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (1,2)  | (3,3)  |

---

### Step 4: Analyze strategic implications of the new game

Now we examine the incentives.

#### For Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 plays A0 → get 7
  - P1 plays A1 → get 1 → so prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 plays A0 → get 2
  - P1 plays A1 → get 3 → so prefer A1

So Player 1 has **no dominant strategy**.

Now check best responses:
- P1’s best response to P2’s A0 is A0
- P1’s best response to P2’s A1 is A1

Now consider symmetry.

#### For Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 plays A0 → 7
  - P2 plays A1 → 1 → so prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 plays A0 → 2
  - P2 plays A1 → 3 → so prefers A1

So P2 also has same structure.

So the Nash equilibria are:
- (A0, A0): both best responses → pure Nash
- (A1, A1): both best responses → pure Nash

Now, what about the payoffs?
- (A0,A0): (7,7)
- (A1,A1): (3,3)

So **(A0,A0)** is **Pareto superior**.

But is it stable? Yes — it's a Nash equilibrium.

Could there be a mixed strategy equilibrium? Possibly, but we care about outcomes.

But the key point: **with the contract, (A0,A0) is an equilibrium and gives 7 points to each**, whereas **without** the contract, (A0,A0) gives 5.

So **you** get **more** by signing, **if the other player also signs and the game is played under the contract**.

But note: **the contract only activates if both sign**.

So the question is: **Should you sign?**

We must now consider what happens depending on whether the other player signs.

But here’s the key: **You do not know whether the other player will sign**, but you know the contract is proposed by them and passed via approval voting. You are being asked to decide whether to sign.

Assumption: The contract is **only active if both sign**. You are deciding whether to sign **knowing** that.

So your payoffs depend on the joint decision:

|   Your choice | Other's choice | Contract active? | Your payoff |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Sign          | Sign           | Yes              | Depends on outcome — could be 7, 2, 1, or 3 |
| Sign          | Don’t sign     | No               | Original game payoffs |
| Don’t sign    | Sign           | No               | Original game payoffs |
| Don’t sign    | Don’t sign     | No               | Original game payoffs |

But here’s the catch: **The other player’s decision is not known**, but the contract was proposed by them and passed via approval voting. That suggests **they are willing to sign**, or at least supported it.

But since this is a decision-making game, and **both must sign**, and the other player is also rational, we need to consider:

- If you sign, and the other player signs → contract active → you can get up to 7.
- If you sign, but the other player doesn’t → no contract → you play original game.

But if you **don’t sign**, then **even if they sign**, the contract doesn't activate → play original game.

So your only chance to get the benefit of the contract is **if you sign and they sign**.

So the value of signing depends on:
1. The **likelihood** the other player signs.
2. Your **expected value** of signing vs. not signing.

But we are not given probabilities. So we must assume **rational players** and **equilibrium thinking**.

Let’s suppose the other player is also rational. Since the contract was proposed by them and passed via approval voting, it suggests they are **in favor of it**.

Moreover, **the contract benefits them too**:
- If both sign, they get 7 in (A0,A0), 3 in (A1,A1) — better than original 5 or 3.
- Even if they don’t get (A0,A0), they can get 3 in (A1,A1), same as before.
- In fact, their payoff structure is symmetric.

But the real question: **Would the other player sign?**

Given that the contract increases their best-case payoff (from 5 to 7) and doesn’t lower worst-case (they get at least 1 or 2, which is better than 0 in original game).

In the original game, if you play A1 and they play A0, they get 0.

In the new game, if you play A1 and they play A0, they get 2 — better.

In fact, **all of their payoffs in the contract version are at least as high as the original**, and improved in key cases.

So the other player **should want to sign**, because:
- It improves their minimum payoff.
- It increases the payoff of the Pareto-optimal equilibrium.
- It creates a more stable incentive to play A0.

So **it’s in the other player’s interest to sign**, and **you can reasonably expect them to sign**.

Moreover, since the contract was passed via approval voting (by the other player, presumably), they are already **committed** to signing.

Now: the only way the contract fails is if you **don’t** sign.

So if you **sign**, and they sign → contract active → you can get 7 if both play A0.

Even in the worst case under contract (if other plays A1), you get 2 (when you play A0) vs original 0 — better.

If you play A1 and they play A0 → you get 1 in contract version, but 3 in original — that’s worse.

Wait — this is important.

In the contract version:
- If you play A1 and they play A0 → you get 1 (from earlier)
- But in original game, you got 3.

So **you are worse off in that case**.

So under contract, **your worst-case outcome is worse** than original.

But is that likely?

Let’s consider: under the contract, the **only way** both play A1 is if both deviate from A0.

But if both are rational and want to coordinate on A0, they may do so.

Let’s analyze **equilibrium play**.

In the contract game, (A0,A0) yields (7,7)
(A1,A1) yields (3,3)

So both players have **incentive to coordinate on A0**, because it gives more.

Moreover, if there’s a focal point, (A0,A0) is clearly better.

So likely, **both players will play A0** under the contract → you get 7.

But what if we consider a mixed strategy?

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability p, and P2 plays A0 with probability q.

But since both players are symmetric, perhaps symmetric Nash equilibrium.

But even without full analysis, notice:

- (A0,A0) is a strict Nash in the contract game: if other plays A0, you strongly prefer A0 (7 > 1).
- (A1,A1) is also a Nash, but (7,7) is better.

So **(A0,A0)** is the **risk-dominant** and **Pareto-efficient** equilibrium.

So **it's reasonable to expect** that both play A0 under the contract.

Thus, **you can expect to get 7 points** if you sign and the other signs.

Now, if you **don’t sign**, then contract is inactive → you play original game.

In original game:
- (A0,A0): (5,5)
- (A1,A1): (3,3)

Best outcome is 5.

But could get 3 or 0 if coordination fails.

So **expected payoff without contract is likely less than 5**, especially if there's uncertainty.

But under contract, if you sign, and other signs, **you get 7** if both coordinate on A0.

Since the other player also has strong incentive to sign (they benefit), and you have incentive too, **signing improves your best-case and your expected payoff**.

Moreover, **only one outcome is worse if you sign** — when you play A1 and other plays A0 → you get 1 vs 3 in original. But:

- That outcome is **not stable** under the contract.
- Because if other plays A0, you get 7 for A0, 1 for A1 → so you prefer A0.
- So in equilibrium, you won’t play A1 if they play A0.

So the **unstable outcome** (you playing A1 when they play A0) is not sustainable.

Therefore, in the contract game, you **would not play A1** if you think they play A0.

So in practice, you’d be playing A0 → get 7.

Thus, **by signing, you can achieve 7**, which is better than the 5 from (A0,A0) in the original game.

And if you don’t sign, you can’t get more than 5 safely — and might get less.

Therefore, **signing is beneficial**.

Even if the other player is uncertain, the contract **aligns incentives** to play A0.

**Final point**: The contract makes A0 more attractive for both players (incentive to get +2), and removes the danger of getting 0 when you play A0 and other plays A1.

In original game: you get 0 if you play A0 and other plays A1.

In contract: you get 2 (because you play A0 → gain 2) even if other plays A1.

So **your minimum payoff increases** from 0 to 1.

Even your worst case under contract is better than worst case original.

Therefore, **signing the contract improves your payoff in all outcome scenarios**?

Let’s check:

| Your action | Other’s action | Payoff (with contract) | Payoff (original) |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0             | 7                      | 5                 |
| A0          | A1             | 2                      | 0                 |
| A1          | A0             | 1                      | 3                 |
| A1          | A1             | 3                      | 3                 |

So:
- A0-A0: 7 > 5 ✅
- A0-A1: 2 > 0 ✅
- A1-A0: 1 < 3 ❌
- A1-A1: 3 = 3 → same

So **only one case is worse**: when you play A1 and other plays A0 → you get 1 vs 3.

But: **in equilibrium**, you would **not** choose A1 if you expect them to play A0 — because 7 > 1.

So in a rational, equilibrium play, you would **play A0** if you think they play A0.

And they do too.

So the **(A1,A0)** outcome is **not sustainable**.

Thus, in practice, you avoid that bad outcome.

So by signing, you **increase the chance of getting high payoff** and **reduce the chance of getting low payoff**, despite the one non-equilibrium outcome being worse.

Moreover, since the **contract encourages coordination on A0**, and **both players have an incentive to do so**, you can expect this outcome.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

## Step-by-step Analysis

### Step 1: Understanding the Original Game

Without the contract, the payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2) is:

|  | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P2: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P2: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

### Step 2: Understanding the Contract's Effect

The contract modifies payoffs:
- Choosing A0: +1 point (taken from the other player)
- Choosing A1: -1 point (given to the other player)

With contract, the payoff matrix becomes:

|  | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P2: A0** | (5, 5) | (2, 1) |
| **P2: A1** | (1, 2) | (3, 3) |

### Step 3: Analyzing Nash Equilibria Without Contract

In the original game:
- (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium with payoff (5, 5)
- (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium with payoff (3, 3)
- (A0, A0) Pareto dominates (A1, A1)

Rational players should coordinate on (A0, A0) for 5 points each.

### Step 4: Analyzing Nash Equilibria With Contract

Let p = Pr(P1 plays A0) and q = Pr(P2 plays A0)

My payoff from A0: 5p + 1(1-p) = 4p + 1
My payoff from A1: 2p + 3(1-p) = 3 - p

I'm indifferent when: 4p + 1 = 3 - p → p = 2/5

Similarly, P1 is indifferent when q = 1/5

**Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**: (p = 2/5, q = 1/5)

My expected payoff:
- E = (2/5)(1/5)(5) + (2/5)(4/5)(1) + (3/5)(1/5)(2) + (3/5)(4/5)(3)
- E = 10/25 + 8/25 + 6/25 + 36/25 = 60/25 = **2.4 points**

### Step 5: Comparison

- **Without contract**: Expected payoff = 5 points (at Pareto optimal equilibrium)
- **With contract**: Expected payoff = 2.4 points (at Nash equilibrium)

The contract reduces my expected payoff from 5 to 2.4 points, making me significantly worse off.

### Conclusion

I should **NOT** sign the contract.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the original payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2 (P1, P2):

- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In the original game, there are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) provides the highest payout (5 points), (A1, A1) is "safer" (risk-dominant) because A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's action, whereas choosing A0 risks getting 0 points if the other player chooses A1. Specifically, you would only choose A0 if you believe there is a >60% probability that the other player will also choose A0 ($5p > 3$, where $p$ is the probability the other player chooses A0).

The proposed contract (proposed by you, Player 2) changes the payoffs if both players sign:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 1 point from the other player.
- (A0, A0): (5+1-1, 5+1-1) = (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0+1, 3-1) = (1, 2)
- (A1, A0): (3-1, 0+1) = (2, 1)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

Under the contract, the Nash equilibria remain (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). However, the trust threshold shifts. You should choose A0 if:
$E(A0) > E(A1)$
$5p + 1(1-p) > 2p + 3(1-p)$
$4p + 1 > 3 - p$
$5p > 2$
$p > 0.4$

The contract lowers the probability required to favor choosing A0 from 60% to 40%. It makes the Pareto-superior outcome (5, 5) more stable and easier to achieve by reducing the risk of playing A0 and reducing the incentive to play A1 when the other player plays A0. Since the contract makes the highest-scoring outcome more likely and doesn't lower the payoff of the (A1, A1) floor, signing it is beneficial.

response:
Let's work through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix**

We are playing a symmetric two-player game where each player chooses either A0 or A1. The payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                              | 5, 5     | 0, 3     |
| **A1**                              | 3, 0     | 3, 3     |

Let’s label:
- You = Player 1
- Other player = Player 2

So, from **your perspective (Player 1)**:

- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get 3
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → you get 3

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Game Without the Contract**

The **contract was proposed but rejected by both players** (including you), so it is **not in effect**. We are playing the **original game only**.

So we ignore the contract entirely.

---

### **Step 3: Find the Nash Equilibrium**

We are to choose a **probability distribution** over A0 and A1 to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming the other player is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s compute the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let:
- You (Player 1) play A0 with probability **p**
- The other player (Player 2) plays A0 with probability **q**

We need to find the value of **p** such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1, **if Player 1 is playing p** (and vice versa).

But since we are choosing **our own** strategy, we need to find the Nash equilibrium **mixed strategy** that is best response to the opponent playing the same mixed strategy.

Let’s find **p** such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1, given that Player 1 plays A0 with probability **p**.

#### Expected payoff for Player 2 if they play A0:

- With probability p: Player 1 plays A0 → payoff = 5
- With probability (1-p): Player 1 plays A1 → payoff = 0

So:
> EU(A0) = p × 5 + (1-p) × 0 = 5p

#### Expected payoff for Player 2 if they play A1:

- With probability p: Player 1 plays A0 → payoff = 3
- With probability (1-p): Player 1 plays A1 → payoff = 3

So:
> EU(A1) = p × 3 + (1-p) × 3 = 3

Player 2 is indifferent when:
> 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So **if Player 1 plays A0 with probability 0.6**, then Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now check if **Player 1** would be indifferent if Player 2 plays A0 with probability **q = 0.6**.

Let’s compute Player 1’s expected payoff:

#### EU of Player 1 playing A0:
- With probability q = 0.6: opponent plays A0 → payoff = 5
- With probability 1−q = 0.4: opponent plays A1 → payoff = 0
→ EU(A0) = 0.6×5 + 0.4×0 = 3

#### EU of Player 1 playing A1:
- With probability q = 0.6: opponent plays A0 → payoff = 3
- With probability 1−q = 0.4: opponent plays A1 → payoff = 3
→ EU(A1) = 0.6×3 + 0.4×3 = 3

So Player 1 is also indifferent when q = 0.6.

✅ Therefore, the **symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** is:
> Both players play A0 with probability **60%**, A1 with **40%**

This is the optimal strategy **assuming the other player plays optimally**.

But the question is: **What should YOU do to maximize your total points?**

Since we are rational and the game is symmetric, and the other player is also rational, the **self-consistent equilibrium strategy** is to play A0 with 60% and A1 with 40%.

Any deviation from this could be exploited if the opponent is predictable, but in equilibrium, this is the best we can do.

---

### **Step 4: Why not pure strategies?**

Let’s test:
- If you play A0 with 100%:
  - Opponent, knowing this, would prefer to play A1 (since getting 3 > 0) → you get 0.
- If you play A1 with 100%:
  - Opponent would play A0 (since 0 < 3), so you get 3.
- But if you play A1 for sure, opponent will play A0 → you get 3.
  - But if you play A0, opponent gets 0, so they’d prefer to play A1 → you get 0.
  - So A0 is risky.

But in equilibrium, both players randomize.

The mixed strategy makes the other player indifferent and gives you a **guaranteed expected payoff of 3**.

Let’s verify:
- Both play A0: (0.6)(0.6) = 0.36 → payoff = 5 → contribution: 0.36×5 = 1.8
- Player 1 A0, Player 2 A1: (0.6)(0.4) = 0.24 → payoff = 0 → 0
- Player 1 A1, Player 2 A0: (0.4)(0.6) = 0.24 → payoff = 3 → 0.24×3 = 0.72
- Both A1: (0.4)(0.4) = 0.16 → payoff = 3 → 0.16×3 = 0.48

Total expected payoff = 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

So expected payoff is 3.

Any other strategy might give more **if the opponent is not playing optimally**, but we assume they are also rational and trying to maximize.

Therefore, the **best guaranteed outcome** is the Nash equilibrium.

---

### **Step 5: Final Decision**

We are to choose probabilities:
- A0: 60%
- A1: 40%

Sum = 100%, valid.

Output in required JSON format.

response:
Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Original Game (without contract)

This is a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|           | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | (5,5) | (0,3) |
| **P2 A1** | (3,0) | (3,3) |

So:
- (A0, A0): (5,5)
- (A0, A1): (0,3)
- (A1, A0): (3,0)
- (A1, A1): (3,3)

Player 2 is the one making the decision (and we're in the position of Player 2).

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Contract

The contract is proposed by Player 2 and is conditional on **all players signing it**.

**Contract terms:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 2 points**, which are **drawn equally from the other player**.

So:
- If Player 2 chooses A0 → Player 2 gains +2 points, but Player 1 pays 2 points (costs Player 1 2 points).
- If Player 2 chooses A1 → no additional payment.
- Same for Player 1: choosing A0 gives them +2, takes 2 from the other.

So the contract effectively **subtracts 2 points from the opponent** when you play A0, and gives you +2.

This is **not symmetric in the outcome matrix**, and importantly, **it only applies if the contract is signed by both players**.

---

### Step 3: What if Player 2 signs the contract?

For the contract to take effect, **both players must sign**.

We are asked whether to **sign** the contract.

But note: **Player 2 proposed the contract** (via approval voting), and now we are deciding whether to sign it.

But: **The contract requires both players to sign**, and we are only Player 2.

**Crucial point:** Since Player 1 hasn’t made a decision yet, we don’t know if they’ll sign.

But since we are only deciding **whether to sign** (and unless we sign, the contract doesn't activate), and the contract is active only if all sign, then:

- If **we sign**, the contract only takes effect if Player 1 also signs.
- If **we don’t sign**, the contract **never activates**, regardless of Player 1’s choice.

So our decision is about whether to risk exposing ourselves to the contract (which could benefit or harm us) depending on whether Player 1 also signs.

But we don’t know Player 1’s strategy. We must assume we don’t know Player 1’s intentions.

So we must ask: Under what conditions would signing the contract be **expected to increase Player 2’s expected payoff**?

---

### Step 4: Analyze the effect of the contract on the payoff matrix

Let’s assume the contract **is signed and active** (so both players sign).

Then, **when a player chooses A0, they receive +2 points, and the other player loses 2 points**.

So we must update the payoff matrix with the contract.

Let’s define the new payoffs under contract.

Let’s denote the **original payoffs**, then **add** the contract effect.

So:

|           | P1 A0 +2 (P2 loses 2) | P1 A1 (+0) |
|-----------|------------------------|------------|
| **P2 A0** | (5 +2 -2, 5 -2 +2) = (5,5) | (0 +2, 3 -2) = (2,1) |
| **P2 A1** | (3 -2, 0 +2) = (1,2) | (3,3) |

Explanation:

- (A0, A0): Both choose A0 → each gets +2 from contract → but they exchange 2 points each → net effect: +2 to self, -2 to other → so P2 gets +2 from contract, P1 loses 2 → original (5,5) becomes (5+2, 5-2)? Wait — no, this is incorrect.

Wait — **clarification needed**:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

Key phrase: "drawn equally from the other players" — but **there is only one other player**, so "drawn equally" means the entire 2 points come from the other player.

So if **a player chooses A0**, they get +2, and the **other player loses 2 points**.

So it's a **direct transfer**: A0 choice → +2 to self, -2 to opponent.

So the contract adds:
- For P2: if chooses A0 → +2
- For P1: if chooses A0 → +2
- Opponent loses 2 in each case.

So we apply this to the base payoffs.

So now update each cell:

#### (P1 A0, P2 A0):
- Base: (5,5)
- P1 chooses A0 → gets +2
- P2 chooses A0 → gets +2
- So P1 gets 5 + 2 = 7
- P2 gets 5 + 2 = 7
- But: P1 gets +2 from contract → pays 2 to P2? No — the payoffs are added **independently**.

Wait: if **P1 chooses A0**, he gains +2, and **that +2 is taken from P2**.

Similarly, **P2 chooses A0**, gains +2, taken from P1.

So:
- In (A0, A0): both choose A0 → so both gain +2, and both pay 2 → so P1 gains +2, but pays 2 (to P2) → net 0? Wait — this is ambiguous.

But the contract says: “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”

But if there is only one other player, “drawn equally from the other players” is just “drawn from the other player”.

So the player chooses A0 → gets +2 from a fund (which is funded by the other player’s loss).

So the net effect is: for each A0 choice, the player gains +2, the other loses 2.

So if **both choose A0**, then:
- P1 gains +2 (from P2)
- P2 gains +2 (from P1)

So P1’s total: 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7
P2’s total: 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7

But P1 **loses 2 to P2**, and P2 **loses 2 to P1** → so the transfer is **symmetric**, and the base payoff is 5 each.

So final: (7,7)

Wait — that seems to make both better off, but that can’t be — money is coming from nowhere?

But the game might have a mechanism to fund the payouts — the contract is abstract, so we assume it’s externally funded or balanced.

But the instruction says: “drawn equally from the other players” — **only one other player**, so the full 2 points are taken from them.

So yes: if P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +2, and P2 loses 2.

Similarly, if P2 chooses A0 → P2 gets +2, and P1 loses 2.

So in (A0, A0), both get +2 from contract, but both lose 2 to the other → so net effect:
- P1: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P2) = 0
- P2: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P1) = 0
- So base (5,5) → (5,5), unchanged?

Wait, this is key.

Let’s parse carefully.

Suppose:
- Player 2 chooses A0 → gets +2 from the contract.
- Where do these +2 come from? “Drawn equally from the other players”.
- So P2’s +2 comes from P1 → P1 loses 2.

Similarly, P1 chooses A0 → gets +2, which comes from P2 → P2 loses 2.

Now, in (A0, A0):
- P2 choose A0 → P2 gains +2, P1 loses 2.
- P1 choose A0 → P1 gains +2, P2 loses 2.
- So net:
  - P1: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P2) = 0
  - P2: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P1) = 0
- So the net contract effect is **zero** for both.

So **the contract does not change payoff in (A0, A0)** — even though both gain +2, they also both lose 2 → net zero.

Similarly, in (A0, A1):
- P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +2, P2 loses 2
- P2 chooses A1 → no bonus, no penalty
- Base payoff: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3
- Contract effect:
  - P1: +2 (from A0) → total = 0 + 2 = 2
  - P2: loses 2 (because P1 chose A0) → base 3, minus 2 → 1
- So new: (2,1)

In (A1, A0):
- P1 chooses A1 → no bonus
- P2 chooses A0 → gets +2, so P1 loses 2
- Base payoff: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0
- Contract:
  - P2: +2 → total 0 + 2 = 2
  - P1: loses 2 → 3 - 2 = 1
- So new: (1,2)

In (A1, A1):
- Neither chooses A0 → no contract payments
- Base: (3,3) → remains (3,3)

So the updated payoff matrix **with contract** is:

|           | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | (5,5) | (2,1) |
| **P2 A1** | (1,2) | (3,3) |

Wait — interesting.

So the contract **only affects outcomes where one player chooses A0 and the other A1**.

And in (A0,A0) → net zero contract effect → unchanged (5,5)

(A1,A1) → unchanged (3,3)

But:
- (A0,A1): P1 chooses A0 → gets +2, P2 loses 2 → (0+2, 3-2) = (2,1)
- (A1,A0): P2 chooses A0 → gets +2, P1 loses 2 → (3-2, 0+2) = (1,2)

So contract makes **A0 a less risky strategy in certain cases**, particularly when playing against A1.

---

### Step 5: Now, what is optimal strategy **with contract**?

We — Player 2 — are deciding whether to sign the contract.

But the contract only applies **if both sign**.

So we must consider two scenarios:

1. We sign the contract → if Player 1 also signs, then game becomes as above, with payoffs:
   - (A0,A0): (5,5)
   - (A0,A1): (2,1)
   - (A1,A0): (1,2)
   - (A1,A1): (3,3)

2. We don’t sign → game remains original:
   - (A0,A0): (5,5)
   - (A0,A1): (0,3)
   - (A1,A0): (3,0)
   - (A1,A1): (3,3)

But — we don’t know what Player 1 will do.

So we need to evaluate: if we sign, will we be better off **assuming Player 1 might sign or not**?

Key point: **The contract is not binding unless both sign.**

So if we sign, and Player 1 does not sign, then the contract doesn’t apply — so we are back to original game.

But we don’t know what Player 1 will do.

But let’s consider the best response in the **contracted game**.

#### Let’s analyze best response in the **contracted game** (assuming both sign).

We are Player 2.

What is best action against each of Player 1’s pure strategies?

Let’s assume we are playing under the contract.

- If P1 chooses A0:
  - P2 A0 → 5
  - P2 A1 → 1
  → best: A0

- If P1 chooses A1:
  - P2 A0 → 2
  - P2 A1 → 3
  → best: A1

So P2’s best responses:
- Against A0 → A0
- Against A1 → A1

So the pure strategy best responses are **to match** P1’s choice.

Now, what about mixed strategies?

Suppose P1 plays A0 with probability q.

Then P2’s expected payoff for choosing A0:
- q * 5 + (1-q) * 2 = 5q + 2 - 2q = 3q + 2

For choosing A1:
- q * 1 + (1-q) * 3 = q + 3 - 3q = 3 - 2q

Set equal to find indifference:
3q + 2 = 3 - 2q → 5q = 1 → q = 0.2

So if P1 plays A0 with prob 0.2, P2 is indifferent.

But if q > 0.2, A0 is better; if q < 0.2, A1 is better.

But we don’t know q.

But observe: **the contract has made the game symmetric in a way**.

Now, compare to **original game**.

In the original game (no contract):

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 A0 → 5
  - P2 A1 → 3 → so best: A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 A0 → 0
  - P2 A1 → 3 → best: A1

So again, best response is to mirror.

Same structure: best response is to match.

But the payoffs are different.

In original game:
- P2 A0 vs P1 A0: 5
- P2 A0 vs P1 A1: 0

In contracted game:
- P2 A0 vs P1 A0: 5
- P2 A0 vs P1 A1: 2

So in the **contracted game**, choosing A0 is **better** in the case where we miscoordinate (A0 vs A1), because payoff is 2 instead of 0.

Similarly, in original, if we play A1 vs A0, we get 3; in contract, we get 1 — worse.

But wait — in contract, when P2 plays A1 vs P1 A0, we get 1 → worse than original 3.

But when P2 plays A0 vs P1 A1, we get 2 vs 0 → better.

So what is the expected payoff?

Let’s suppose both players play the same mixed strategy: q for A0.

Then we can compare expected payoffs.

But we need to ask: **Is signing the contract beneficial for us, regardless of what Player 1 does?**

But we don’t control Player 1.

So best way: consider if **signing the contract is beneficial in expectation**, assuming rational play from both.

But we need to compare: payoffs under **contracted game** vs **original game**, but only if both sign.

But if we sign, and Player 1 signs, we play contracted game.

If we sign, but Player 1 doesn’t, contract doesn’t apply → original game.

But we can’t control Player 1.

So the **safest assumption** is that **Player 1 will not sign** the contract unless it benefits them.

But we don’t know their reasoning.

Alternate approach: suppose **we sign**, what happens?

- If Player 1 also signs → we play contracted game → we can analyze its Nash equilibria.
- If Player 1 doesn’t sign → we play original game.

So our expected payoff depends on whether Player 1 signs.

But we don’t know.

But perhaps we can ask: **Is the contraction game better for us than the original game, assuming both play optimally?**

Compare Nash equilibria.

#### Original Game (without contract):

Payoffs:

|           | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | 5,5   | 0,3   |
| **P2 A1** | 3,0   | 3,3   |

Find pure Nash equilibria:

- (A0,A0): P2 gets 5 > 3 (if switch to A1), P1 gets 5 > 0 → so neither wants to deviate → **NE**
- (A1,A1): P2 gets 3 = 3, P1 gets 3 = 3 → neither wants to deviate → **NE**

Mixed equilibrium?

Let P1 play A0 with prob q.

P2 A0: 5q
P2 A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3(q + 1 - q) = 3 → wait:

Wait:
- P2 A0 payoff: q*5 + (1-q)*0 = 5q
- P2 A1 payoff: q*3 + (1-q)*3 = 3
Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

Similarly, for P1: let P2 play A0 with prob p

P1 A0: p*5 + (1-p)*0 = 5p
P1 A1: p*3 + (1-p)*3 = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So mixed Nash: both play A0 with 0.6

Now expected payoff for P2:
- 0.6 * 0.6 * 5 + 0.6 * 0.4 * 0 + 0.4

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.


Your previous response was:
Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Original Game (without contract)

This is a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|           | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | (5,5) | (0,3) |
| **P2 A1** | (3,0) | (3,3) |

So:
- (A0, A0): (5,5)
- (A0, A1): (0,3)
- (A1, A0): (3,0)
- (A1, A1): (3,3)

Player 2 is the one making the decision (and we're in the position of Player 2).

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Contract

The contract is proposed by Player 2 and is conditional on **all players signing it**.

**Contract terms:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 2 points**, which are **drawn equally from the other player**.

So:
- If Player 2 chooses A0 → Player 2 gains +2 points, but Player 1 pays 2 points (costs Player 1 2 points).
- If Player 2 chooses A1 → no additional payment.
- Same for Player 1: choosing A0 gives them +2, takes 2 from the other.

So the contract effectively **subtracts 2 points from the opponent** when you play A0, and gives you +2.

This is **not symmetric in the outcome matrix**, and importantly, **it only applies if the contract is signed by both players**.

---

### Step 3: What if Player 2 signs the contract?

For the contract to take effect, **both players must sign**.

We are asked whether to **sign** the contract.

But note: **Player 2 proposed the contract** (via approval voting), and now we are deciding whether to sign it.

But: **The contract requires both players to sign**, and we are only Player 2.

**Crucial point:** Since Player 1 hasn’t made a decision yet, we don’t know if they’ll sign.

But since we are only deciding **whether to sign** (and unless we sign, the contract doesn't activate), and the contract is active only if all sign, then:

- If **we sign**, the contract only takes effect if Player 1 also signs.
- If **we don’t sign**, the contract **never activates**, regardless of Player 1’s choice.

So our decision is about whether to risk exposing ourselves to the contract (which could benefit or harm us) depending on whether Player 1 also signs.

But we don’t know Player 1’s strategy. We must assume we don’t know Player 1’s intentions.

So we must ask: Under what conditions would signing the contract be **expected to increase Player 2’s expected payoff**?

---

### Step 4: Analyze the effect of the contract on the payoff matrix

Let’s assume the contract **is signed and active** (so both players sign).

Then, **when a player chooses A0, they receive +2 points, and the other player loses 2 points**.

So we must update the payoff matrix with the contract.

Let’s define the new payoffs under contract.

Let’s denote the **original payoffs**, then **add** the contract effect.

So:

|           | P1 A0 +2 (P2 loses 2) | P1 A1 (+0) |
|-----------|------------------------|------------|
| **P2 A0** | (5 +2 -2, 5 -2 +2) = (5,5) | (0 +2, 3 -2) = (2,1) |
| **P2 A1** | (3 -2, 0 +2) = (1,2) | (3,3) |

Explanation:

- (A0, A0): Both choose A0 → each gets +2 from contract → but they exchange 2 points each → net effect: +2 to self, -2 to other → so P2 gets +2 from contract, P1 loses 2 → original (5,5) becomes (5+2, 5-2)? Wait — no, this is incorrect.

Wait — **clarification needed**:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

Key phrase: "drawn equally from the other players" — but **there is only one other player**, so "drawn equally" means the entire 2 points come from the other player.

So if **a player chooses A0**, they get +2, and the **other player loses 2 points**.

So it's a **direct transfer**: A0 choice → +2 to self, -2 to opponent.

So the contract adds:
- For P2: if chooses A0 → +2
- For P1: if chooses A0 → +2
- Opponent loses 2 in each case.

So we apply this to the base payoffs.

So now update each cell:

#### (P1 A0, P2 A0):
- Base: (5,5)
- P1 chooses A0 → gets +2
- P2 chooses A0 → gets +2
- So P1 gets 5 + 2 = 7
- P2 gets 5 + 2 = 7
- But: P1 gets +2 from contract → pays 2 to P2? No — the payoffs are added **independently**.

Wait: if **P1 chooses A0**, he gains +2, and **that +2 is taken from P2**.

Similarly, **P2 chooses A0**, gains +2, taken from P1.

So:
- In (A0, A0): both choose A0 → so both gain +2, and both pay 2 → so P1 gains +2, but pays 2 (to P2) → net 0? Wait — this is ambiguous.

But the contract says: “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”

But if there is only one other player, “drawn equally from the other players” is just “drawn from the other player”.

So the player chooses A0 → gets +2 from a fund (which is funded by the other player’s loss).

So the net effect is: for each A0 choice, the player gains +2, the other loses 2.

So if **both choose A0**, then:
- P1 gains +2 (from P2)
- P2 gains +2 (from P1)

So P1’s total: 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7
P2’s total: 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7

But P1 **loses 2 to P2**, and P2 **loses 2 to P1** → so the transfer is **symmetric**, and the base payoff is 5 each.

So final: (7,7)

Wait — that seems to make both better off, but that can’t be — money is coming from nowhere?

But the game might have a mechanism to fund the payouts — the contract is abstract, so we assume it’s externally funded or balanced.

But the instruction says: “drawn equally from the other players” — **only one other player**, so the full 2 points are taken from them.

So yes: if P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +2, and P2 loses 2.

Similarly, if P2 chooses A0 → P2 gets +2, and P1 loses 2.

So in (A0, A0), both get +2 from contract, but both lose 2 to the other → so net effect:
- P1: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P2) = 0
- P2: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P1) = 0
- So base (5,5) → (5,5), unchanged?

Wait, this is key.

Let’s parse carefully.

Suppose:
- Player 2 chooses A0 → gets +2 from the contract.
- Where do these +2 come from? “Drawn equally from the other players”.
- So P2’s +2 comes from P1 → P1 loses 2.

Similarly, P1 chooses A0 → gets +2, which comes from P2 → P2 loses 2.

Now, in (A0, A0):
- P2 choose A0 → P2 gains +2, P1 loses 2.
- P1 choose A0 → P1 gains +2, P2 loses 2.
- So net:
  - P1: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P2) = 0
  - P2: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P1) = 0
- So the net contract effect is **zero** for both.

So **the contract does not change payoff in (A0, A0)** — even though both gain +2, they also both lose 2 → net zero.

Similarly, in (A0, A1):
- P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +2, P2 loses 2
- P2 chooses A1 → no bonus, no penalty
- Base payoff: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3
- Contract effect:
  - P1: +2 (from A0) → total = 0 + 2 = 2
  - P2: loses 2 (because P1 chose A0) → base 3, minus 2 → 1
- So new: (2,1)

In (A1, A0):
- P1 chooses A1 → no bonus
- P2 chooses A0 → gets +2, so P1 loses 2
- Base payoff: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0
- Contract:
  - P2: +2 → total 0 + 2 = 2
  - P1: loses 2 → 3 - 2 = 1
- So new: (1,2)

In (A1, A1):
- Neither chooses A0 → no contract payments
- Base: (3,3) → remains (3,3)

So the updated payoff matrix **with contract** is:

|           | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | (5,5) | (2,1) |
| **P2 A1** | (1,2) | (3,3) |

Wait — interesting.

So the contract **only affects outcomes where one player chooses A0 and the other A1**.

And in (A0,A0) → net zero contract effect → unchanged (5,5)

(A1,A1) → unchanged (3,3)

But:
- (A0,A1): P1 chooses A0 → gets +2, P2 loses 2 → (0+2, 3-2) = (2,1)
- (A1,A0): P2 chooses A0 → gets +2, P1 loses 2 → (3-2, 0+2) = (1,2)

So contract makes **A0 a less risky strategy in certain cases**, particularly when playing against A1.

---

### Step 5: Now, what is optimal strategy **with contract**?

We — Player 2 — are deciding whether to sign the contract.

But the contract only applies **if both sign**.

So we must consider two scenarios:

1. We sign the contract → if Player 1 also signs, then game becomes as above, with payoffs:
   - (A0,A0): (5,5)
   - (A0,A1): (2,1)
   - (A1,A0): (1,2)
   - (A1,A1): (3,3)

2. We don’t sign → game remains original:
   - (A0,A0): (5,5)
   - (A0,A1): (0,3)
   - (A1,A0): (3,0)
   - (A1,A1): (3,3)

But — we don’t know what Player 1 will do.

So we need to evaluate: if we sign, will we be better off **assuming Player 1 might sign or not**?

Key point: **The contract is not binding unless both sign.**

So if we sign, and Player 1 does not sign, then the contract doesn’t apply — so we are back to original game.

But we don’t know what Player 1 will do.

But let’s consider the best response in the **contracted game**.

#### Let’s analyze best response in the **contracted game** (assuming both sign).

We are Player 2.

What is best action against each of Player 1’s pure strategies?

Let’s assume we are playing under the contract.

- If P1 chooses A0:
  - P2 A0 → 5
  - P2 A1 → 1
  → best: A0

- If P1 chooses A1:
  - P2 A0 → 2
  - P2 A1 → 3
  → best: A1

So P2’s best responses:
- Against A0 → A0
- Against A1 → A1

So the pure strategy best responses are **to match** P1’s choice.

Now, what about mixed strategies?

Suppose P1 plays A0 with probability q.

Then P2’s expected payoff for choosing A0:
- q * 5 + (1-q) * 2 = 5q + 2 - 2q = 3q + 2

For choosing A1:
- q * 1 + (1-q) * 3 = q + 3 - 3q = 3 - 2q

Set equal to find indifference:
3q + 2 = 3 - 2q → 5q = 1 → q = 0.2

So if P1 plays A0 with prob 0.2, P2 is indifferent.

But if q > 0.2, A0 is better; if q < 0.2, A1 is better.

But we don’t know q.

But observe: **the contract has made the game symmetric in a way**.

Now, compare to **original game**.

In the original game (no contract):

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 A0 → 5
  - P2 A1 → 3 → so best: A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 A0 → 0
  - P2 A1 → 3 → best: A1

So again, best response is to mirror.

Same structure: best response is to match.

But the payoffs are different.

In original game:
- P2 A0 vs P1 A0: 5
- P2 A0 vs P1 A1: 0

In contracted game:
- P2 A0 vs P1 A0: 5
- P2 A0 vs P1 A1: 2

So in the **contracted game**, choosing A0 is **better** in the case where we miscoordinate (A0 vs A1), because payoff is 2 instead of 0.

Similarly, in original, if we play A1 vs A0, we get 3; in contract, we get 1 — worse.

But wait — in contract, when P2 plays A1 vs P1 A0, we get 1 → worse than original 3.

But when P2 plays A0 vs P1 A1, we get 2 vs 0 → better.

So what is the expected payoff?

Let’s suppose both players play the same mixed strategy: q for A0.

Then we can compare expected payoffs.

But we need to ask: **Is signing the contract beneficial for us, regardless of what Player 1 does?**

But we don’t control Player 1.

So best way: consider if **signing the contract is beneficial in expectation**, assuming rational play from both.

But we need to compare: payoffs under **contracted game** vs **original game**, but only if both sign.

But if we sign, and Player 1 signs, we play contracted game.

If we sign, but Player 1 doesn’t, contract doesn’t apply → original game.

But we can’t control Player 1.

So the **safest assumption** is that **Player 1 will not sign** the contract unless it benefits them.

But we don’t know their reasoning.

Alternate approach: suppose **we sign**, what happens?

- If Player 1 also signs → we play contracted game → we can analyze its Nash equilibria.
- If Player 1 doesn’t sign → we play original game.

So our expected payoff depends on whether Player 1 signs.

But we don’t know.

But perhaps we can ask: **Is the contraction game better for us than the original game, assuming both play optimally?**

Compare Nash equilibria.

#### Original Game (without contract):

Payoffs:

|           | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | 5,5   | 0,3   |
| **P2 A1** | 3,0   | 3,3   |

Find pure Nash equilibria:

- (A0,A0): P2 gets 5 > 3 (if switch to A1), P1 gets 5 > 0 → so neither wants to deviate → **NE**
- (A1,A1): P2 gets 3 = 3, P1 gets 3 = 3 → neither wants to deviate → **NE**

Mixed equilibrium?

Let P1 play A0 with prob q.

P2 A0: 5q
P2 A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3(q + 1 - q) = 3 → wait:

Wait:
- P2 A0 payoff: q*5 + (1-q)*0 = 5q
- P2 A1 payoff: q*3 + (1-q)*3 = 3
Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

Similarly, for P1: let P2 play A0 with prob p

P1 A0: p*5 + (1-p)*0 = 5p
P1 A1: p*3 + (1-p)*3 = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So mixed Nash: both play A0 with 0.6

Now expected payoff for P2:
- 0.6 * 0.6 * 5 + 0.6 * 0.4 * 0 + 0.4

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in the response 'Let’s break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Original Game (without contract)\n\nThis is a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.\n\nPayoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):\n\n|           | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |\n|-----------|-------|-------|\n| **P2 A0** | (5,5) | (0,3) |\n| **P2 A1** | (3,0) | (3,3) |\n\nSo:\n- (A0, A0): (5,5)\n- (A0, A1): (0,3)\n- (A1, A0): (3,0)\n- (A1, A1): (3,3)\n\nPlayer 2 is the one making the decision (and we\'re in the position of Player 2).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Contract\n\nThe contract is proposed by Player 2 and is conditional on **all players signing it**.\n\n**Contract terms:**\n- If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 2 points**, which are **drawn equally from the other player**.\n\nSo:\n- If Player 2 chooses A0 → Player 2 gains +2 points, but Player 1 pays 2 points (costs Player 1 2 points).\n- If Player 2 chooses A1 → no additional payment.\n- Same for Player 1: choosing A0 gives them +2, takes 2 from the other.\n\nSo the contract effectively **subtracts 2 points from the opponent** when you play A0, and gives you +2.\n\nThis is **not symmetric in the outcome matrix**, and importantly, **it only applies if the contract is signed by both players**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: What if Player 2 signs the contract?\n\nFor the contract to take effect, **both players must sign**.\n\nWe are asked whether to **sign** the contract.\n\nBut note: **Player 2 proposed the contract** (via approval voting), and now we are deciding whether to sign it.\n\nBut: **The contract requires both players to sign**, and we are only Player 2.\n\n**Crucial point:** Since Player 1 hasn’t made a decision yet, we don’t know if they’ll sign.\n\nBut since we are only deciding **whether to sign** (and unless we sign, the contract doesn\'t activate), and the contract is active only if all sign, then:\n\n- If **we sign**, the contract only takes effect if Player 1 also signs.\n- If **we don’t sign**, the contract **never activates**, regardless of Player 1’s choice.\n\nSo our decision is about whether to risk exposing ourselves to the contract (which could benefit or harm us) depending on whether Player 1 also signs.\n\nBut we don’t know Player 1’s strategy. We must assume we don’t know Player 1’s intentions.\n\nSo we must ask: Under what conditions would signing the contract be **expected to increase Player 2’s expected payoff**?\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the effect of the contract on the payoff matrix\n\nLet’s assume the contract **is signed and active** (so both players sign).\n\nThen, **when a player chooses A0, they receive +2 points, and the other player loses 2 points**.\n\nSo we must update the payoff matrix with the contract.\n\nLet’s define the new payoffs under contract.\n\nLet’s denote the **original payoffs**, then **add** the contract effect.\n\nSo:\n\n|           | P1 A0 +2 (P2 loses 2) | P1 A1 (+0) |\n|-----------|------------------------|------------|\n| **P2 A0** | (5 +2 -2, 5 -2 +2) = (5,5) | (0 +2, 3 -2) = (2,1) |\n| **P2 A1** | (3 -2, 0 +2) = (1,2) | (3,3) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n- (A0, A0): Both choose A0 → each gets +2 from contract → but they exchange 2 points each → net effect: +2 to self, -2 to other → so P2 gets +2 from contract, P1 loses 2 → original (5,5) becomes (5+2, 5-2)? Wait — no, this is incorrect.\n\nWait — **clarification needed**:\n\n> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."\n\nKey phrase: "drawn equally from the other players" — but **there is only one other player**, so "drawn equally" means the entire 2 points come from the other player.\n\nSo if **a player chooses A0**, they get +2, and the **other player loses 2 points**.\n\nSo it\'s a **direct transfer**: A0 choice → +2 to self, -2 to opponent.\n\nSo the contract adds:\n- For P2: if chooses A0 → +2\n- For P1: if chooses A0 → +2\n- Opponent loses 2 in each case.\n\nSo we apply this to the base payoffs.\n\nSo now update each cell:\n\n#### (P1 A0, P2 A0):\n- Base: (5,5)\n- P1 chooses A0 → gets +2\n- P2 chooses A0 → gets +2\n- So P1 gets 5 + 2 = 7\n- P2 gets 5 + 2 = 7\n- But: P1 gets +2 from contract → pays 2 to P2? No — the payoffs are added **independently**.\n\nWait: if **P1 chooses A0**, he gains +2, and **that +2 is taken from P2**.\n\nSimilarly, **P2 chooses A0**, gains +2, taken from P1.\n\nSo:\n- In (A0, A0): both choose A0 → so both gain +2, and both pay 2 → so P1 gains +2, but pays 2 (to P2) → net 0? Wait — this is ambiguous.\n\nBut the contract says: “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”\n\nBut if there is only one other player, “drawn equally from the other players” is just “drawn from the other player”.\n\nSo the player chooses A0 → gets +2 from a fund (which is funded by the other player’s loss).\n\nSo the net effect is: for each A0 choice, the player gains +2, the other loses 2.\n\nSo if **both choose A0**, then:\n- P1 gains +2 (from P2)\n- P2 gains +2 (from P1)\n\nSo P1’s total: 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7\nP2’s total: 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7\n\nBut P1 **loses 2 to P2**, and P2 **loses 2 to P1** → so the transfer is **symmetric**, and the base payoff is 5 each.\n\nSo final: (7,7)\n\nWait — that seems to make both better off, but that can’t be — money is coming from nowhere?\n\nBut the game might have a mechanism to fund the payouts — the contract is abstract, so we assume it’s externally funded or balanced.\n\nBut the instruction says: “drawn equally from the other players” — **only one other player**, so the full 2 points are taken from them.\n\nSo yes: if P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +2, and P2 loses 2.\n\nSimilarly, if P2 chooses A0 → P2 gets +2, and P1 loses 2.\n\nSo in (A0, A0), both get +2 from contract, but both lose 2 to the other → so net effect:\n- P1: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P2) = 0\n- P2: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P1) = 0\n- So base (5,5) → (5,5), unchanged?\n\nWait, this is key.\n\nLet’s parse carefully.\n\nSuppose:\n- Player 2 chooses A0 → gets +2 from the contract.\n- Where do these +2 come from? “Drawn equally from the other players”.\n- So P2’s +2 comes from P1 → P1 loses 2.\n\nSimilarly, P1 chooses A0 → gets +2, which comes from P2 → P2 loses 2.\n\nNow, in (A0, A0):\n- P2 choose A0 → P2 gains +2, P1 loses 2.\n- P1 choose A0 → P1 gains +2, P2 loses 2.\n- So net:\n  - P1: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P2) = 0\n  - P2: +2 (from contract) - 2 (to P1) = 0\n- So the net contract effect is **zero** for both.\n\nSo **the contract does not change payoff in (A0, A0)** — even though both gain +2, they also both lose 2 → net zero.\n\nSimilarly, in (A0, A1):\n- P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +2, P2 loses 2\n- P2 chooses A1 → no bonus, no penalty\n- Base payoff: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3\n- Contract effect:\n  - P1: +2 (from A0) → total = 0 + 2 = 2\n  - P2: loses 2 (because P1 chose A0) → base 3, minus 2 → 1\n- So new: (2,1)\n\nIn (A1, A0):\n- P1 chooses A1 → no bonus\n- P2 chooses A0 → gets +2, so P1 loses 2\n- Base payoff: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0\n- Contract:\n  - P2: +2 → total 0 + 2 = 2\n  - P1: loses 2 → 3 - 2 = 1\n- So new: (1,2)\n\nIn (A1, A1):\n- Neither chooses A0 → no contract payments\n- Base: (3,3) → remains (3,3)\n\nSo the updated payoff matrix **with contract** is:\n\n|           | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |\n|-----------|-------|-------|\n| **P2 A0** | (5,5) | (2,1) |\n| **P2 A1** | (1,2) | (3,3) |\n\nWait — interesting.\n\nSo the contract **only affects outcomes where one player chooses A0 and the other A1**.\n\nAnd in (A0,A0) → net zero contract effect → unchanged (5,5)\n\n(A1,A1) → unchanged (3,3)\n\nBut:\n- (A0,A1): P1 chooses A0 → gets +2, P2 loses 2 → (0+2, 3-2) = (2,1)\n- (A1,A0): P2 chooses A0 → gets +2, P1 loses 2 → (3-2, 0+2) = (1,2)\n\nSo contract makes **A0 a less risky strategy in certain cases**, particularly when playing against A1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Now, what is optimal strategy **with contract**?\n\nWe — Player 2 — are deciding whether to sign the contract.\n\nBut the contract only applies **if both sign**.\n\nSo we must consider two scenarios:\n\n1. We sign the contract → if Player 1 also signs, then game becomes as above, with payoffs:\n   - (A0,A0): (5,5)\n   - (A0,A1): (2,1)\n   - (A1,A0): (1,2)\n   - (A1,A1): (3,3)\n\n2. We don’t sign → game remains original:\n   - (A0,A0): (5,5)\n   - (A0,A1): (0,3)\n   - (A1,A0): (3,0)\n   - (A1,A1): (3,3)\n\nBut — we don’t know what Player 1 will do.\n\nSo we need to evaluate: if we sign, will we be better off **assuming Player 1 might sign or not**?\n\nKey point: **The contract is not binding unless both sign.**\n\nSo if we sign, and Player 1 does not sign, then the contract doesn’t apply — so we are back to original game.\n\nBut we don’t know what Player 1 will do.\n\nBut let’s consider the best response in the **contracted game**.\n\n#### Let’s analyze best response in the **contracted game** (assuming both sign).\n\nWe are Player 2.\n\nWhat is best action against each of Player 1’s pure strategies?\n\nLet’s assume we are playing under the contract.\n\n- If P1 chooses A0:\n  - P2 A0 → 5\n  - P2 A1 → 1\n  → best: A0\n\n- If P1 chooses A1:\n  - P2 A0 → 2\n  - P2 A1 → 3\n  → best: A1\n\nSo P2’s best responses:\n- Against A0 → A0\n- Against A1 → A1\n\nSo the pure strategy best responses are **to match** P1’s choice.\n\nNow, what about mixed strategies?\n\nSuppose P1 plays A0 with probability q.\n\nThen P2’s expected payoff for choosing A0:\n- q * 5 + (1-q) * 2 = 5q + 2 - 2q = 3q + 2\n\nFor choosing A1:\n- q * 1 + (1-q) * 3 = q + 3 - 3q = 3 - 2q\n\nSet equal to find indifference:\n3q + 2 = 3 - 2q → 5q = 1 → q = 0.2\n\nSo if P1 plays A0 with prob 0.2, P2 is indifferent.\n\nBut if q > 0.2, A0 is better; if q < 0.2, A1 is better.\n\nBut we don’t know q.\n\nBut observe: **the contract has made the game symmetric in a way**.\n\nNow, compare to **original game**.\n\nIn the original game (no contract):\n\n- If P1 plays A0:\n  - P2 A0 → 5\n  - P2 A1 → 3 → so best: A0\n- If P1 plays A1:\n  - P2 A0 → 0\n  - P2 A1 → 3 → best: A1\n\nSo again, best response is to mirror.\n\nSame structure: best response is to match.\n\nBut the payoffs are different.\n\nIn original game:\n- P2 A0 vs P1 A0: 5\n- P2 A0 vs P1 A1: 0\n\nIn contracted game:\n- P2 A0 vs P1 A0: 5\n- P2 A0 vs P1 A1: 2\n\nSo in the **contracted game**, choosing A0 is **better** in the case where we miscoordinate (A0 vs A1), because payoff is 2 instead of 0.\n\nSimilarly, in original, if we play A1 vs A0, we get 3; in contract, we get 1 — worse.\n\nBut wait — in contract, when P2 plays A1 vs P1 A0, we get 1 → worse than original 3.\n\nBut when P2 plays A0 vs P1 A1, we get 2 vs 0 → better.\n\nSo what is the expected payoff?\n\nLet’s suppose both players play the same mixed strategy: q for A0.\n\nThen we can compare expected payoffs.\n\nBut we need to ask: **Is signing the contract beneficial for us, regardless of what Player 1 does?**\n\nBut we don’t control Player 1.\n\nSo best way: consider if **signing the contract is beneficial in expectation**, assuming rational play from both.\n\nBut we need to compare: payoffs under **contracted game** vs **original game**, but only if both sign.\n\nBut if we sign, and Player 1 signs, we play contracted game.\n\nIf we sign, but Player 1 doesn’t, contract doesn’t apply → original game.\n\nBut we can’t control Player 1.\n\nSo the **safest assumption** is that **Player 1 will not sign** the contract unless it benefits them.\n\nBut we don’t know their reasoning.\n\nAlternate approach: suppose **we sign**, what happens?\n\n- If Player 1 also signs → we play contracted game → we can analyze its Nash equilibria.\n- If Player 1 doesn’t sign → we play original game.\n\nSo our expected payoff depends on whether Player 1 signs.\n\nBut we don’t know.\n\nBut perhaps we can ask: **Is the contraction game better for us than the original game, assuming both play optimally?**\n\nCompare Nash equilibria.\n\n#### Original Game (without contract):\n\nPayoffs:\n\n|           | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |\n|-----------|-------|-------|\n| **P2 A0** | 5,5   | 0,3   |\n| **P2 A1** | 3,0   | 3,3   |\n\nFind pure Nash equilibria:\n\n- (A0,A0): P2 gets 5 > 3 (if switch to A1), P1 gets 5 > 0 → so neither wants to deviate → **NE**\n- (A1,A1): P2 gets 3 = 3, P1 gets 3 = 3 → neither wants to deviate → **NE**\n\nMixed equilibrium?\n\nLet P1 play A0 with prob q.\n\nP2 A0: 5q\nP2 A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3(q + 1 - q) = 3 → wait:\n\nWait:\n- P2 A0 payoff: q*5 + (1-q)*0 = 5q\n- P2 A1 payoff: q*3 + (1-q)*3 = 3\nSet equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nSimilarly, for P1: let P2 play A0 with prob p\n\nP1 A0: p*5 + (1-p)*0 = 5p\nP1 A1: p*3 + (1-p)*3 = 3\n\nSet equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6\n\nSo mixed Nash: both play A0 with 0.6\n\nNow expected payoff for P2:\n- 0.6 * 0.6 * 5 + 0.6 * 0.4 * 0 + 0.4'

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.

Let's analyze this decision step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

The base game is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

We are Player 1.

Looking at this, we can analyze the Nash equilibria and best responses.

#### Best responses:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → best to play A0.
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1 gets 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → best to play A1.

So, Player 1 has no dominant strategy, but the best response depends on Player 2.

Similarly for Player 2.

Let’s find pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): (5,5). If Player 1 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no gain. If Player 2 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no gain. So it's a NE.
- (A1, A1): (3,3). If Player 1 deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3 → no gain. Same for Player 2. So it's also a NE.
- (A0, A1): (0,3). Player 1 wants to deviate to A1 → gets 3 > 0 → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): (3,0). Player 2 wants to deviate to A1 → gets 3 > 0 → not equilibrium.

So two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

There's also a mixed strategy equilibrium, but we’ll get to that.

---

### **Step 2: Consider the Contract**

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

Key points:
- The bonus is **1 point** for choosing A0.
- It's **drawn equally from the other players** — meaning, if you choose A0, you gain +1, and the other player loses 1 (since the "drawn equally from the other players" implies the cost is shared).
- The contract only applies if **all players sign** it.
- The contract is **proposed by Player 2**, and we are deciding whether to sign it.

We are Player 1 → we decide whether to sign. The contract takes effect only if both players sign.

So if we sign, and Player 2 signs → contract active.

If either refuses → no contract → game proceeds as base game.

---

### **Step 3: How does the contract change the game?**

Let’s modify the payoff matrix with the contract **if both sign**.

Each time a player chooses A0, they gain +1 point, **but the opponent loses 1 point** (since the cost is drawn from the other player — “drawn equally from the other players” is a bit ambiguous, but the phrase “drawn equally from the other players” suggests that the cost to the “other players” is borne collectively).

But wait: “drawn equally from the other players” — if you are the only other player, then the entire 1 point cost falls on the opponent.

So, interpretation:
- If you play A0 → +1 to you.
- The opponent → -1 (because the 1 point is drawn from them).
- If you play A1 → no extra effect.

So the **net effect** of the contract is:
- A0 → gain +1 (at opponent’s expense).
- A1 → no change.

This **does not change your payoff per se**, but **alters the strategic interaction** by changing the payoffs.

Let’s update the payoff matrix under the contract (both players signed).

Original payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (5,5)
- (A0, A1): (0,3)
- (A1, A0): (3,0)
- (A1, A1): (3,3)

Now apply the contract bonus:
- If you play A0 → +1
- If opponent plays A0 → -1 (to them, as they lose 1)

So modified payoffs:

|               | P2: A0 (P1: A0 gets +1, P2: -1) | P2: A1 (P2 plays A1 → no change) |
|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **P1: A0**   | (5 + 1, 5 - 1) = (6, 4)        | (0 + 1, 3) = (1, 3)           |
| **P1: A1**   | (3, 0 - 1) = (3, -1)            | (3, 3)                         |

Wait: when P1 plays A0, P1 gets +1 → so P1’s payoff increases by 1.
When P2 plays A0, P2 loses 1 → P2’s payoff decreases by 1.

So:

- (A0, A0): P1 gets 5 + 1 = 6, P2 gets 5 - 1 = 4
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 + 1 = 1, P2 gets 3 (no change, since P2 played A1)
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3 (no change, P1 played A1), P2 gets 0 - 1 = -1
- (A1, A1): both get 3, no change

So the new payoff matrix (with contract active) is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**   | (6, 4) | (1, 3) |
| **P1: A1**   | (3, -1)| (3, 3) |

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the Contracted Game from Player 1’s Perspective**

We want to know: **Should Player 1 sign the contract?**

But this depends on **what Player 2 will do**.

We assume both players are rational and aim to maximize their own payoff.

But we also need to consider: **Will Player 2 sign the contract?**

The contract was proposed by Player 2. So Player 2 wants to sign it only if it benefits them.

Let’s analyze the contract **from Player 2’s perspective**.

Player 2 sees that:
- If they sign, and Player 1 also signs, then:
  - If Player 2 plays A0 → they get +1 (bonus)
  - But if Player 1 plays A0, then Player 2 loses 1 (because the cost is drawn from the other player).

So the contract is **better for Player 2 only if they are likely to play A0** or if they expect Player 1 to play A0.

Wait — let’s recheck the phrasing:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- When **any player chooses A0**, they gain +1.
- The cost of that +1 is **shared by the other players**.

But since there’s only one other player, they pay -1.

So, for Player 2:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → +1 to them, and Player 1 loses 1.
- If Player 1 plays A0 → Player 1 gains +1, Player 2 loses 1.

So from Player 2’s perspective, **they want the other player to play A0** because then Player 2 loses 1.

But that’s bad for Player 2.

Wait — that’s critical:

- When **Player 1 plays A0**, Player 2 loses 1 (because the cost is drawn from them).
- When **Player 2 plays A0**, they gain +1.

So Player 2 **benefits from playing A0** only if the other player plays A1.

But if the other player plays A0, then Player 2 loses 1.

So the **contract gives Player 2 a +1 incentive to play A0**, but also **punishes them if Player 1 plays A0**.

Similarly, Player 1 gets +1 for playing A0, but **is punished if Player 2 plays A0**.

So the contract creates a **conflict of interest in coordination**.

Let’s ask: **Would Player 2 want to sign this contract?**

Player 2’s interest:
- They gain +1 when they play A0.
- They lose 1 when Player 1 plays A0.

So if Player 2 expects Player 1 to play A0, then Player 2 **does not want to play A0** — because they’d lose 1.

But if they expect Player 1 to play A1, then Player 2 wants to play A0 to get +1.

So unless Player 2 expects Player 1 to play A1, they are hesitant to play A0.

But Player 1 may also be hesitant to play A0 if they expect Player 2 to play A0.

The contract **increases the risk of playing A0**, because the payoff depends on the other player’s action.

Let us compute whether **Player 2 wants to sign** the contract, **in a world where Player 1 might or might not sign**.

But we are deciding whether **we (Player 1)** should sign.

The outcome depends on **both signing**.

So to evaluate whether to sign, we need to ask:

> If I sign, is it likely that Player 2 will also sign?
> And if both sign, does that benefit me?

Alternatively: **Would Player 2 sign the contract?**

Let’s compute Player 2’s expected payoff under the contract, compared to the base game.

But note: **the contract is only active if both sign**. So if I don’t sign, no contract → base game.

So Player 2 will consider: “If I sign, and Player 1 signs, what happens to my expected payoff?”

But Player 2 can **only benefit from signing if they believe that the expected value of the contract benefits them**.

Let’s compute the **expected payoff** for Player 2 under the contract **if both sign** — but this depends on the mix of strategies.

But we can look at the **strategic incentives**.

### **Step 5: What happens to the game under the contract? (Both sign)**

We already have the modified payoff matrix (with contract):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**   | (6, 4) | (1, 3) |
| **P1: A1**   | (3, -1)| (3, 3) |

Let’s find the Nash equilibria of this new game.

#### Best responses:

**Player 1’s best response:**
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 6 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best: A0.
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best: A1.

So P1’s best response:
- A0 if P2 plays A0
- A1 if P2 plays A1

**Player 2’s best response:**
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best: A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets -1 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best: A1

So P2’s best response:
- A0 if P1 plays A0
- A1 if P1 plays A1

Now check for equilibria:

- (A0, A0): P1 wants A0 if P2 plays A0 → yes. P2 wants A0 if P1 plays A0 → yes. → **NE**
- (A1, A1): P1 wants A1 if P2 plays A1 → yes. P2 wants A1 if P1 plays A1 → yes. → **NE**

So two pure NE under contract: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Now, what is Player 1’s payoff in each?

- In (A0,A0): (6,4) → P1 gets 6
- In (A1,A1): (3,3) → P1 gets 3

So Player 1 prefers (A0,A0)

But is (A0,A0) stable? Yes — both are best responding.

But now: **in the base game**, (A0,A0) was also a NE. But now, the **payoff** is higher for P1 (6 vs 5), and lower for P2 (4 vs 5).

So Player 2 **does not prefer** (A0,A0) now — they get 4 < 5.

In base game, (A0,A0) gave them 5. Now the contract makes them get 4 → so **they are worse off** compared to the base game if they end up in (A0,A0).

But in (A1,A1), Player 2 gets 3 — same as base game.

So Player 2's incentives are **altered**.

But more importantly: **does Player 2 want to sign the contract?**

Let’s compute their **expected payoff** under contract vs base game.

But the contract only changes things if both sign.

So suppose we (P1) **sign the contract**. Now, would Player 2 want to sign?

Player 2 must ask: “If I sign, and P1 signs, what happens?”

They know that the new game has two equilibria:
- (A0,A0): P2 gets 4
- (A1,A1): P2 gets 3

But they may also mix.

But note: **in the base game**, there were two NE:
- (A0,A0): P2 gets 5
- (A1,A1): P2 gets 3

So in the base game, P2 gets **at least 3**, potentially 5.

Under contract, even in the best case, P2 gets 4 < 5.

So, **no matter which equilibrium they play, Player 2 gets less than or equal to 4**, while in base game they can get 5.

So **Player 2 is worse off under the contract in their best outcome**, and same in the other.

Therefore, **Player 2 has no incentive to sign the contract** — because even their best outcome under contract is worse than their best in base game.

Moreover, if they sign, they risk being in (A0,A0), where they get 4 < 5.

Also, they may not be able to coordinate on (A0,A0), and might accidentally end up in (A1,A1), getting 3 — same as base game.

But no improvement.

So Player 2 will **not sign** the contract.

Hence, the contract **will not be activated**, unless **Player 2 is willing to sign**, but they are not.

So **if I sign**, and Player 2 sees that they are worse off, they will **refuse**.

And I, as a rational player, know that.

Therefore, **signing the contract would be a waste** — because it won’t be in effect.

But what if I sign, and Player 2 also signs? We need to consider whether Player 2 might **still sign**.

But Player 2 gets **no benefit** from signing — their maximum payoff under contract is 4 < 5.

They cannot do better than in the base game.

So they have **no incentive** to sign.

Therefore, **Player 2 will not sign**, no matter what.

So **the contract will not be active** if I sign, unless Player 2 signs anyway, but they won’t.

So **if I sign**, nothing changes — the game proceeds as base game.

But if I don’t sign, same thing.

So signing has **no effect**.

But wait: **is there any risk to me?**

No risk, because if I sign, but Player 2 doesn’t sign → contract inactive → I play base game.

And if I don’t sign → same.

So **signing has no cost or benefit**, as long as Player 2 doesn’t sign.

But could signing induce Player 2 to sign?

Suppose Player 2 thinks: “If I sign, and Player 1 signs, then we play the contracted game.”

But Player 2 calculates: “If I sign, and P1 signs, then the best I can do is get 4, but in base game I can get 5 — so I am worse off in the best case.”

So they have **no incentive**.

Therefore, **Player 2 will not sign**, regardless.

So signing is **useless**.

But — could there be an equilibrium where both sign? Only if Player 2 believes that signing is beneficial, but it’s not.

So **no such equilibrium**.

Hence, **I should not sign**, because:
- It has no benefit (contract won’t activate).
- And I gain nothing.
- But I might be seen as naive or exploited (if Player 2 thinks I’m likely to sign, but I won’t gain).

Wait — but there is a **subtlety**.

Suppose I **sign the contract**, and Player 2 sees that I am committed to signing.

Then Player 2 might rationally say: “If I also sign, I get to play the contracted game.”

But as we saw, **the contracted game is worse for Player 2** — their best outcome is 4 < 5.

So they still won’t want to.

Unless… could the **mixed strategy equilibrium** under contract be better?

Let’s compute.

Under contract, the modified game:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**   | (6, 4) | (1, 3) |
| **P1: A1**   | (3, -1)| (3, 3) |

Let’s find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let p = P(P1 plays A0)

Let q = P(P2 plays A0)

P1 is indifferent when:
E[P1 | A0] = E[P1 | A1]

E[P1 | A0] = 6q + 1(1 - q) = 6q + 1 - q = 5q + 1

E[P1 | A1] = 3q + 3(1 - q) = 3q + 3 - 3q = 3

Set equal:
5q + 1 = 3 → 5q = 2 → q = 0.4

So P2 plays A0 with 0.4, A1 with 0.6

Now for P2 to be indifferent:

E[P2 | A0] = E[P2 | A1]

E[P2 | A0] = 4p + (-1)(1 - p) = 4p -1 + p = 5p -1

E[P2 | A1] = 3p + 3(1 - p) = 3

Set equal:
5p - 1 = 3 → 5p = 4 → p = 0.8

So mixed strategy NE: P1 plays A0 with 0.8, P2 plays A0 with 0.4

Then Player 1’s expected payoff:
= 0.8 * [6 * 0.4 + 1 * 0.6] + 0.2 * [3 * 0.4 + 3 * 0.6]
= 0.8 * (2.4 + 0.6) + 0.2 * (1.2 + 1.8)
= 0.8 * 3 + 0.2 * 3 = 2.4 + 0.6 = 3

Player 2’s payoff:
= 0.8 * [4 * 0.4 + 3 * 0.6] + 0.2 * [-1 * 0.4 + 3 * 0.6]
= 0.8 * (1.6 + 1.8) + 0.2 * (-0.4 + 1.8)
= 0.8 * 3.4 + 0.2 * 1.4
= 2.72 + 0.28 = 3.0

So both players get 3 in the mixed equilibrium.

In the **base game**, let’s find mixed equilibrium.

Base game:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**   | (5,5) | (0,3) |
| **P1: A1**   | (3,0) | (3,3) |

P1 indifferent when:
5q + 0(1-q) = 3q + 3(1-q)
5q = 3q + 3 - 3q → 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

P2 indifferent when:
5p + 0(1-p) = 0p + 3(1-p)
5p = 3 - 3p → 8p = 3 → p = 3/8 = 0.375

Then P1’s expected payoff:
= 0.375 * [5*0.6 + 0*0.4] + 0.625 * [3*0.6 + 3*0.4]
= 0.375 * (3) + 0.625 * (1.8 + 1.2)
= 1.125 + 0.625 * 3 = 1.125 + 1.875 = 3

So in base game, mixed equilibrium gives P1: 3

In contracted game, mixed equilibrium gives P1: 3

But **in the pure strategy equilibria**, P1 can do better in contracted game: (A0,A0) gives 6, but in base game only 5.

But Player 2 doesn’t want to play (A0,A0) — they get 4 vs 5.

So **Player 2 will not allow (A0,A0)** to be played.

In fact, Player 2 will want to avoid A0 to avoid losing points.

So **the likely outcome** is (A1,A1) or mixed.

But Player 2 is worse off in all outcomes.

Thus, **Player 2 has no incentive to sign the contract**.

Therefore, **if I sign, it won’t activate**, so I get the same outcome as if I don’t sign.

But is there any **strategic risk** in signing?

Suppose I sign, and Player 2 thinks: “If I sign, I might end up in (A0,A0), but I get 4 < 5, so no.”

So they still won’t sign.

Alternatively, if I sign, and Player 2 doesn’t sign, then contract inactive → base game.

So I get base game outcomes.

But if I don’t sign, same thing.

So **signing has no strategic effect, and no benefit**.

But why would I sign? There is **no upside**.

In fact, **the contract only gives benefits if I play A0, but it also makes my payoff sensitive to the other player’s action in a way that could hurt me**.

For example, if Player 2 plays A0, then my payoff from A0 drops from 5 to 6 — actually **increases**! Wait.

Wait: in contracted game, if P2 plays A0, then P1's A0 gets:
- 5 (base) +1 (bonus) = 6
- But P2’s payoff drops by 1 → but that’s P2’s loss.

So my A0 payoff is **higher**.

But if P2 plays A0, I get more for A0.

But P2 doesn’t like it.

So actually, **the contract makes A0 more attractive for me**, because I get +1 if I play A0, regardless.

But the cost to me is if P2 plays A0 — then my P2’s payoff drops by 1, but **that doesn’t affect me** — it only hurts P2.

Wait — no: in the contract, when I play A0, I get +1, and the other player loses 1 — **so my payoff is increased by 1, even if P2 plays A0**.

So **my payoff is always +1 higher than base game if I play A0**.

For example:
- If I play A0 and P2 plays A0: base 5 → new 6 → I get +1.
- If I play A0 and P2 plays A1: base 0 → new 1 → I get +1.

So **if I play A0, I get +1 no matter what**.

But if I play A1, no change.

So **the contract makes A0 strictly better for me, no matter what Player 2 does**.

But only if the contract is active.

But if I sign and Player 2 doesn’t sign → contract inactive → I get base payoffs.

So I gain **nothing**.

But if **both sign**, then A0 is **better** for me.

So the **only benefit** is if the contract activates.

But Player 2 sees that:
- If they sign, then:
  - If I play A0 → they lose 1
  - If they play A0 → they gain +1

But their **maximum** payoff is 4 < 5.

So **they are worse off**.

So they will **not sign**.

Even though the contract is **good for me** if activated, **Player 2 will not sign**, so it won’t be activated.

Therefore, signing is **valueless**.

Hence, I should **not sign**.

Moreover, if I sign, I might be seen as weak or exploitable (e.g., Player 2 might play A1 to exploit the contract), but they still wouldn’t sign.

But since they won’t sign, there’s no effect.

So **no benefit, no loss** — but signing is **not worth it**.

But wait — what if Player 2 is risk-averse or something?

But we assume rational players.

**Conclusion**: The contract will not activate because Player 2 has no incentive to sign.

Therefore, signing gives no benefit.

Hence, the rational choice is **not to sign**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

The game is a symmetric 2-player game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from Player 1's perspective):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 5, 5         | 0, 3         |
| **Player 1: A1** | 3, 0         | 3, 3         |

This is a coordination game with an incentive to coordinate on (A0, A0) for mutual benefit, but also a temptation to defect (A1) when the other plays A0.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria in mixed strategies.

---

### **Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium Without the Contract**

Let:
- Player 1 choose A0 with probability p
- Player 2 choose A0 with probability q

Player 1's expected payoff from A0:
- 5*q + 0*(1−q) = 5q

Player 1's expected payoff from A1:
- 3*q + 3*(1−q) = 3

Player 1 is indifferent when:  
5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So Player 1 will mix if Player 2 plays A0 with 0.6 probability.

Similarly, Player 2’s expected payoff:
- From A0: 5p + 0*(1−p) = 5p
- From A1: 3p + 3*(1−p) = 3

Indifference when: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

Thus, the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) is: both players play A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

Expected payoff for each player in MSNE:
- E = 0.6×0.6×5 + 0.6×0.4×0 + 0.4×0.6×3 + 0.4×0.4×3  
  = 0.36×5 + 0 + 0.24×3 + 0.16×3  
  = 1.8 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

Alternatively, since in the MSNE, each player gets 3 on average (because A1 always gives 3), and they mix only when the A0 payoff equals 3.

So **without the contract, each player gets 3 points in equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contract**

The contract is proposed by Player 2 and approved via voting.

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, **drawn equally from the other player(s)**.  
> If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So, **if both players sign**, then:
- When a player chooses A0, they get **+5**, but **the other player loses 5** (since the 5 is drawn from the other player).
- When a player chooses A1, no transfer.

But this is **mutual**: if **both** players sign, then:
- If both play A0 → each gets +5, so payoff becomes:
  - (5 + 5, 5 + 5) = (10, 10)
- If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 plays A1 → Player 1 gets +5, Player 2 gets 0 → payoffs:
  - (0 + 5, 3 + 0) = (5, 3)
- If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 plays A0 → (3 + 0, 0 + 5) = (3, 5)
- If both play A1 → no bonus, so (3, 3)

So the **new payoff matrix, when the contract is in effect**, is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10 | 5, 3   |
| **P1: A1**    | 3, 5   | 3, 3   |

This is a **very different game**.

Now:
- (A0, A0) is a dominant strategy for both? Let's see.

Let’s analyze best responses.

Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1’s payoffs: A0 → 10, A1 → 3 → best response: A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1’s payoffs: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → best response: A0

✅ So regardless of what Player 2 does, Player 1's best response is **A0**.

Similarly, Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best response: A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best response: A0

✅ So both players have a dominant strategy: **A0**

Therefore, **with the contract in effect**, the unique Nash equilibrium is **(A0, A0)**, resulting in **10 points each**.

---

### **Step 4: Should You Sign the Contract?**

But: **The contract only takes effect if both players sign it**.

Player 2 proposed it and it passed approval voting — so Player 2 will sign it.

But **you** must decide whether to sign.

Let’s analyze your incentives.

Case 1: You sign the contract → the new game applies → both play A0 → you get 10

Case 2: You **do not** sign the contract → the original game applies → expected payoff is 3 (in MSNE), or possibly more if you coordinate on A0

But wait: if you don’t sign, does the contract still apply?

No. The contract is **only active if all players sign it**.

So if you don’t sign, it’s back to the original game.

But now, **Player 2 is committed to signing**, because the vote passed.

So:
- If **you sign** → contract active → game becomes 10,10 (A0,A0) → you get 10
- If **you don’t sign** → no contract → original game applies → both players know this

But since Player 2 *expects* you to sign and is still willing to sign, they likely expect the contract to be effective.

But **if you don’t sign**, you're better off by not being bound by the contract — but also lose the possibility of the payout.

But in the original game, what happens?

In the original game, with no contract, both players have an equilibrium at (0.6, 0.6) → 3 points each.

But: could they coordinate on A0?

Yes — there is a **coordinating outcome** (A0,A0) that gives 5 each — better than the mixed equilibrium.

But coordination is fragile. Without a contract, both might fear being exploited.

But here’s the twist: **Player 2 signed the contract**, meaning they are committed to following the contract if it is active.

But if **you don’t sign**, then the contract is **not active**, so **Player 2 cannot require you to follow it**, and you can choose whatever strategy.

So implicitly, **Player 2 is betting that you will sign**, so that the contract can take effect.

But if you **don’t sign**, the contract is dead, and the original game resumes.

In that case, **Player 2** is just as rational as you.

What will Player 2 do in the original game?

We already know: in the original game, (A0,A0) is a **Nash equilibrium** (each gets 5, no incentive to deviate).

But (A1,A1) is also a NE: both get 3.

And mixed strategy at p=0.6.

But the **Pareto-efficient** outcome is (A0,A0) with 5 each.

So, if you are rational and the other player is rational, you might both play A0, resulting in 5 each.

But: **is that stable?**

Check if A0 is a best response:

- If you play A0, Player 2 playing A0 → get 5
- If you play A1, get 3 if they play A0 → so better to play A0

So **A0 is a best response to A0**.

Similarly for Player 2.

So **(A0,A0)** is a Nash equilibrium in the original game.

Therefore, **even without the contract**, if both players can coordinate on (A0,A0), they can get 5 each.

But is that “safe”? Could you be exploited?

Let’s suppose you play A0, and they play A1.

You get 0 — bad.

So there’s a risk.

But in equilibrium, you expect the other to play A0.

Similarly, if you play A0, they play A0 → you get 5.

So if you believe they will play A0 (as they are rational and know you’ll play A0), you’re happy to play A0.

So (A0,A0) is an equilibrium and credible.

Therefore: **even without the contract, it’s possible (and rational)** to get 5 points.

But now, with the contract, you can **guarantee yourself 10 points**, **if you sign**.

But only if **both sign** — and Player 2 will sign, so if you sign, outcome is (A0,A0) → 10.

So by signing, you get 10 instead of 5.

Is that possible?

Wait: in the contract-based game, **you are forced to pay** if you play A0? No — you **receive** 5.

But the **cost is borne by the other player**.

But if **you** play A0, and **they** play A0, you get 5 (base) + 5 (contract) = 10, and they get 5 (base) + 5 (contract) = 10.

So both gain — but the 5 is “drawn equally from the other” — meaning the system takes 5 from the other and gives 5 to you.

So it’s a **transfer of 5 from the other player to you** when you choose A0.

But only if you are both under the contract.

So if you sign, and play A0, you get +5 no matter what.

But if you don’t sign, you get nothing extra.

Now, what if you **don’t sign**, but Player 2 signs?

Then the contract is inactive → back to original game.

In that case, Player 2 might still play A0 (because it’s in their interest), and if you play A0, you get 5.

But if you play A1, you get 3.

So you’ll play A0 → get 5.

But if you **do sign**, you get 10.

So clearly, **signing gives you 10**, **not signing gives you 5 at best**.

But could you get less than 5?

Yes — if Player 2 plays A1.

But if Player 2 is rational, and you’re playing A0, they get 0 if they play A1 vs 3 if they play A0 → so they’ll play A0.

So it’s safe.

But only if you sign, the contract is active.

And since Player 2 signed, the **only reason the contract fails is if you don’t sign**.

So your decision is: **sign → get 10 for sure (in equilibrium)**  
**don’t sign → get 5 (if equilibrium is (A0,A0)**

So clearly, **signing gives you more**.

But is there a risk?

Let’s consider: what if, by signing, you allow **Player 2 to extract value from you**? No — the contract says: if you play A0, you get +5, and **the other player loses 5**.

So it’s **you** who benefits from playing A0.

So playing A0 is better for you when the contract is active.

Moreover, since both players have a dominant strategy to play A0 when the contract is in effect, the outcome is **inevitable**: (A0,A0), both get 10.

So your payoff: **10** if you sign.

If you don’t sign: contract inactive → back to original game → equilibrium at (A0,A0) → you get 5.

(Or you might get less, if mixed strategies, but 5 is achievable.)

So 10 > 5.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

But wait — is there a possibility that **if you sign**, Player 2 might not play A0?

No — because if you sign, then both are under contract, and A0 is dominant.

Even if they are irrational or miscalculate, in game theory, we assume rationality.

So **if you sign, then regardless of what Player 2 does (but they are rational), they will play A0**, and you get 10.

But if you don’t sign, and the contract is inactive, you’re back to original game — unless you can coordinate.

But coordination is possible, and (A0,A0) is an equilibrium → so you get 5.

But **10 > 5**, so signing is strictly better.

But one concern: **is the contract fair**, or could it trap you?

Suppose you sign, but then you play A0, and Player 2 plays A1.

Then you get 5 (from base) + 5 (contract) = 10

Player 2 gets 3 (base) + 0 (since they play A1) = 3

So you still gain 10.

Player 2 gets 3, which is worse than if they played A0 → 10.

So Player 2 has no incentive to deviate to A1.

So they **must** play A0.

So the only outcome is (A0,A0), you get 10.

The only other possibility is if you don’t sign — then no contract, but still (A0,A0) possible → 5.

So signing gives you **5 more points** in equilibrium.

---

### **Final Decision: Should You Sign?**

Yes.

- Sign → guaranteed 10 in equilibrium
- Don’t sign → maximum 5 in equilibrium (assuming coordination)
- So signing is strictly better

Even if you’re risk-averse, you are guaranteed more.

No downside: the contract only helps you when you play A0, and you get +5 in that case.

And since A0 is dominant under the contract, you will play it.

Thus, the optimal decision is to sign.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's analyze this decision step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game without the contract

The original payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2) is:

|              | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**   | 5,5    | 0,3    |
| **P1: A1**   | 3,0    | 3,3    |

This is a **coordination game with a tension between cooperation and risk**.

- If both choose A0: 5 each (best outcome for both)
- If one chooses A0 and the other A1: the A0 player gets 0, A1 player gets 3
- If both choose A1: 3 each

So A0 is better *if the other player also chooses A0*, but dangerous if the other chooses A1.

In the absence of coordination, players might fear being exploited and choose A1.

Let’s compute the Nash equilibria in the original game (without contract):

- (A0, A0): If P1 sticks with A0, P2 gets 5 vs 3 from A1 → P2 prefers A0. Similarly, P1 prefers A0. So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 3 from A1, 0 from A0 → prefers A1. Same for P1. So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0; would switch to A1 → get 3. So not stable.
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 0; would switch to A1 → get 3. Not stable.

So two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Mixed strategy equilibrium also exists, but for now, keep in mind that cooperation (A0, A0) is possible if players can coordinate.

But without communication or commitment, both might play A1 to avoid getting 0.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, **drawn equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payment.

So:
- If you choose A0 → you gain +4 points.
- But this 4 points comes **from the other player**, meaning the other player loses 4 points **if you choose A0**.

So the net effect: **Whichever player chooses A0 gets +4, and the other player loses 4 points**.

This is a **transfer mechanism**: choosing A0 now gives you a +4, but costs the opponent 4.

But note: only if **you** choose A0. So if you choose A0, you get +4; if the other player chooses A0, **they** get +4 (and you lose 4).

---

### Step 3: How does the contract change the payoffs?

Let’s rewrite the payoff matrix *with the contract applied*, assuming **both** players sign.

Key: **The contract is only active if both sign.** So we only consider this modified game if you sign and the other player signs.

We assume that Player 2 proposed the contract, and it’s now up to you to decide whether to sign.

So: **If you sign, then the contract becomes active only if the other player also signs**.

We have to decide whether to sign, assuming the other player *might* sign (but we don’t know). But the contract is only effective if both sign.

However, the question is: **Should you sign the contract?**

We must consider:

- If you sign, and the other player signs → game is played with contract.
- If you sign, but other player doesn’t → contract inactive → game played as original.
- If you don’t sign → contract inactive → game is original.

So your choice depends on:
1. What the other player will do (but we’re not told; so must reason about likely behavior).
2. Whether signing improves your expected payoff, relative to not signing.

But note: the contract is proposed by Player 2, and we are told it was selected via approval voting (presumably from relevant players, but this is not entirely clear). However, since it’s proposed, and you decide whether to sign, we assume that Player 2 may sign or not.

But we are not told whether Player 2 signs or not.

Ah — this is crucial.

Crucial insight: **You are deciding whether to sign. The contract only becomes active if all players sign.**

So, **you don't know whether the other player will sign**.

But based on the description, the contract was "selected via approval voting" — likely meaning it was approved by enough players to be activated. But who voted? Only you and the other player, presumably.

So if Player 2 proposed it, and it was approved via voting, then **Player 2 signed**.

But the question says: “The contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)” — this implies the contract passed approval, so **both players must have approved it**.

Therefore, **if the contract was selected via approval voting, then both players have already agreed to it.**

Therefore: **The contract is binding and active**, provided you now agree to sign (since you're the second player to sign, but the approval voting just passed).

But wait — to clarify: **approval voting likely means the contract was accepted by the players. So we can assume Player 2 signed.**

Then, **you are being asked whether to sign the contract.** And the contract only takes effect if all players sign.

So: Only if **you sign**, will the contract be active.

Hence: **You must decide whether to sign, and only if you do, the contract takes effect.**

But the contract *has already been approved via voting*, and we're being asked to sign.

This may mean that the contract requires your consent to activate.

Given the phrasing: "you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract", and the contract becomes active only if all sign — it's likely that you are the last player to sign.

So: **Player 2 has already signed (via approval voting). Now you must decide whether to sign.**

So now, the contract will be active **only if you sign**.

So we analyze: **Should you sign?** That is, should you accept this modified game?

Let’s now re-analyze the game **with the contract in effect**.

---

### Step 4: Payoff matrix with contract (both players signed)

Now, when a player chooses A0, they get +4 points **(from the other player)**.

So we need to update the payoffs.

Let’s recompute the payoffs.

Original payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 5,5
- (A0, A1): 0,3
- (A1, A0): 3,0
- (A1, A1): 3,3

Now add contract effect:

- If you choose A0 → +4, but opponent loses 4
- If opponent chooses A0 → they gain +4, you lose 4
- If you choose A1 → no change
- So whenever a player chooses A0, it **adds +4 to their own payoff and subtracts 4 from the opponent's**

So let's compute the new payoffs.

#### Case 1: P1: A0, P2: A0

- Base: 5,5
- P1 chooses A0 → +4 → total: 5 + 4 = 9
- P2 chooses A0 → +4 → total: 5 + 4 = 9
- So new payoffs: **9, 9**

But wait: is the 4 drawn *from the other player*? The contract says: "an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn equally from the other players" — "other players" plural — but there is only one other player.

So clearly, it means: the 4 is taken from the other player.

So: when P1 chooses A0, P1 gains 4, P2 loses 4.

Similarly, when P2 chooses A0, P2 gains 4, P1 loses 4.

So both actions of choosing A0 **add to the actor** and **deduct from the opponent**.

But if both choose A0, then:
- P1 gains 4 (from P2)
- P2 gains 4 (from P1)
- So net: both get +4 each compared to base.

Yes — so (A0, A0): base 5,5 → new payoffs: 5+4 and 5+4 → **9,9**

Similarly:

#### Case 2: P1: A0, P2: A1

- Base payoff: 0,3
- P1 chose A0 → gains +4
- P2 chose A1 → no effect
- So P1: 0 + 4 = 4
- P2: 3 (unchanged) → but wait: was the 4 drawn from P2?

Yes: when P1 chooses A0, the +4 is drawn from P2.

So P1 gets +4, P2 loses 4.

So P2’s payoff: 3 - 4 = -1

P1: 0 + 4 = 4

So payoff: **4, -1**

#### Case 3: P1: A1, P2: A0

- Base: 3,0
- P1 chose A1 → no change
- P2 chose A0 → P2 gains +4, so P1 loses 4
- So P1: 3 - 4 = -1
- P2: 0 + 4 = 4
- Payoff: **-1, 4**

#### Case 4: P1: A1, P2: A1

- Both chose A1 → no effect
- Base: 3,3 → remains **3,3**

So the new payoff matrix with contract (both signed) is:

|              | P2: A0     | P2: A1     |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| **P1: A0**   | **9, 9**   | **4, -1**  |
| **P1: A1**   | **-1, 4**  | **3, 3**   |

Now, analyze this game.

---

### Step 5: Nash equilibria in the contract game

Let’s find Nash equilibria.

Check each cell:

1. (A0, A0): 9,9
   - P1: If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 9 from A0, or -1 from A1 → prefers A0
   - P2: If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 9 from A0, or 4 from A1 → prefers A0
   - So both have incentive to stay → **Nash equilibrium**

2. (A0, A1): 4, -1
   - P1: If P2 chooses A1, P1 gets 4 from A0, 3 from A1 → prefers A0
   - P2: If P1 chooses A0, P2 gets -1 from A1, or 4 from A0 → prefers A0
   - So P2 wants to switch → not Nash

3. (A1, A0): -1, 4
   - P1: If P2 chooses A0, P1 gets -1 from A1, 9 from A0 → prefers A0
   - P2: If P1 chooses A1, P2 gets 4 from A0, 3 from A1 → prefers A0
   - So P1 wants to switch → not Nash

4. (A1, A1): 3,3
   - P1: If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 from A1, 4 from A0 → prefers A0
   - So P1 wants to switch → not Nash

So the **only Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**, with payoff (9,9)

That’s excellent — it drives both players to coordinate on A0.

---

### Step 6: But what if you don’t sign?

Then the contract is inactive → game returns to original.

In the original game:
- Two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)
- (A0, A0): 5,5
- (A1, A1): 3,3

So if you don’t sign, and expect the other player to be rational, you might end up in either equilibrium.

But (A0, A0) is better — so if you can coordinate, you get 5.

But without coordination, risk of (A1, A1) exists.

But now, **if you sign**, and the other player signed (which we assume, via approval voting), then the only equilibrium is (A0, A0) — a much better outcome for you: 9 vs 5.

So signing offers a guaranteed better outcome — as long as the other player signs.

But is the other player likely to sign?

Well, remember: **the contract was selected via approval voting** — so **Player 2 must have voted to sign**.

So **Player 2 will sign**.

Now, the contract only activates if both sign.

So if you **sign**, then contract activates → game becomes the one with (A0, A0) as the only equilibrium.

And you get 9.

If you **don’t sign**, contract inactive → original game.

In original game, best outcome is (A0, A0) → 5.

But is that guaranteed? Not necessarily.

There is a possibility of (A1, A1) → 3.

So your expected payoff is uncertain.

But if you sign, and contract activates, then **both players will play A0** (as it's the only Nash equilibrium), so you get **9 for sure**.

Therefore, **you get 9 if you sign**.

If you don’t sign, and you assume the other player is rational, you might expect them to play A0 to try to get 5, but you might also fear they play A1 (to avoid getting 0).

But in the original game, without coordination, it’s risky.

However, since Player 2 proposed the contract, it suggests they believe A0 is good.

Moreover, if you sign, you are **guaranteeing** a high payoff of 9.

If you don’t sign, your payoff is at most 5, and possibly lower.

You could compute mixed strategies.

But let’s compare:

- **Sign**: You get **9** (since contract makes (A0, A0) the only equilibrium; assuming both play optimally, they play A0).

- **Don’t sign**: You get at most 5, possibly 3, depending on coordination.

Thus, **signing is strictly better**.

But is there a risk?

Suppose you sign, contract activates — but then the other player might not play A0?

No — because in the contract-based game, (A0, A0) is the **only Nash equilibrium** — so both players will choose A0 to maximize payoff.

So you **get 9** if you sign.

If you don’t sign, you only get 5 at best — and only if both cooperate.

But in the original game, players might not cooperate. A1 is a safe choice.

So without the contract, certainty of getting 3 is possible (if both play A1), or 5 (if both play A0), but no commitment.

But with contract, you **lock in** getting 9.

So signing gives you a **higher guaranteed payoff**.

### Step 7: Also consider incentive to deviate

Suppose you sign, contract active.

You choose actions. What’s best?

Suppose you think P2 will play A0 → you get 9 vs -1 → best to play A0

Suppose P2 plays A1 → you get 4 vs 3 → still better to play A0

So for you, A0 is a **strongly dominant strategy** in the contract game!

Because:
- If P2: A0 → you get 9 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2: A1 → you get 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → still prefer A0

So **A0 is dominant for you**, regardless of P2’s move.

Similarly, P2’s payoff matrix is symmetric (since the contract is symmetric).

So P2 also has A0 as dominant strategy.

Therefore, **no matter what**, both players will play A0 — it's dominant!

So **you get 9 for sure** if you sign.

If you don’t sign, you're back to original game.

There, A0 is not dominant:

- If P2 plays A0 → you get 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1 → you get 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So no dominant strategy.

Best response depends on expectation.

So in original game, if you believe P2 will play A0, you play A0; if you think P2 might play A1, you might play A1 to avoid 0.

So unless you can coordinate, you might play A1 and get 3.

But you only get 5 in the best case.

So **by signing**, you **guarantee** 9.

By not signing, you risk getting 3 or less.

So **signing is strictly better**.

---

### Final Answer:

You should sign the contract because it increases your guaranteed payoff from potentially 5 (or 3) in the original game to **9 for sure**, due to the contract making A0 a dominant strategy.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game Without the Contract

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1. The payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Payoff | Other Player's Payoff |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5           | 5                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 3           | 3                      |

This is a symmetric game, but not completely symmetric in payoffs (for instance, when both play A0, both get 5; when both play A1, both get 3).

Our goal is to choose a **mixed strategy** (i.e., a probability distribution over A0 and A1) that **maximizes our expected payoff**, assuming the other player is also rational and will choose their own strategy optimally.

We are Player 1.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Game for Nash Equilibrium

Let’s denote:
- Your probability of choosing A0: **p**
- Other player’s probability of choosing A0: **q**

We want to find a mixed strategy for you that is a best response to the other player’s strategy, and vice versa.

But since we don’t know the other player’s strategy, we can look for a **Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies**.

Let’s compute the expected payoff for Player 1 given p (your choice) and q (other player’s choice).

---

#### Expected Payoff for Player 1:

E1 = p*q*5 + p*(1−q)*0 + (1−p)*q*3 + (1−p)*(1−q)*3  
= 5pq + 0 + 3q(1−p) + 3(1−p)(1−q)  
= 5pq + 3q − 3pq + 3(1 − p − q + pq)  
= (5pq − 3pq) + 3q + 3 − 3p − 3q + 3pq  
= 2pq + 3q + 3 − 3p − 3q + 3pq  
Wait — let’s recompute carefully:

Break it down:

1. A0 vs A0: p*q → 5 → 5pq  
2. A0 vs A1: p*(1−q) → 0 → 0  
3. A1 vs A0: (1−p)*q → 3 → 3q(1−p)  
4. A1 vs A1: (1−p)*(1−q) → 3 → 3(1−p)(1−q)

So:

E1 = 5pq + 0 + 3q(1−p) + 3(1−p)(1−q)

Expand:
= 5pq + 3q − 3pq + 3[(1−p)(1−q)]
= (5pq − 3pq) + 3q + 3(1 − p − q + pq)
= 2pq + 3q + 3 − 3p − 3q + 3pq
= (2pq + 3pq) + (3q − 3q) + 3 − 3p
= 5pq − 3p + 3

So:

**E1 = 5pq − 3p + 3**

Now, we want to find the best response.

But to find a symmetric equilibrium, suppose Player 2 is using a mixed strategy q. Then Player 1 wants to choose p to maximize E1.

But instead, let’s find the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

In a Nash equilibrium, each player must be indifferent between their pure strategies given the other player’s mixed strategy.

---

#### Find q such that Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

If Player 1 plays A0, expected payoff:
- With probability q: other plays A0 → payoff = 5
- With probability 1−q: other plays A1 → payoff = 0
→ E(A0) = 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q

If Player 1 plays A1:
- With probability q: other plays A0 → payoff = 3
- With probability 1−q: other plays A1 → payoff = 3
→ E(A1) = 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

Set them equal for indifference:
5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.6, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now do the reverse: for Player 2 to be indifferent, what should Player 1's q be?

Let’s compute Player 2’s expected payoffs given Player 1 plays A0 with probability p.

Player 2's payoffs:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - P(both A0) = p → payoff = 5
  - P(Player 1 plays A1) = 1−p → payoff = 0
  → E(A0) = 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - P(Player 1 plays A0) = p → payoff = 3
  - P(Player 1 plays A1) = 1−p → payoff = 3
  → E(A1) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So the **unique mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** is:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability 0.6
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.6

In this equilibrium, each player gets expected payoff:
- E1 = 5*(0.6)*(0.6) + 0 + 3*(0.4)*(0.6) + 3*(0.4)*(0.4)
= 5*0.36 + 0 + 3*0.24 + 3*0.16
= 1.8 + 0.72 + 0.48
= 3.0

Alternatively, from earlier formula: E1 = 5pq − 3p + 3
= 5*(0.6)*(0.6) − 3*(0.6) + 3 = 1.8 − 1.8 + 3 = 3

So expected payoff is 3.

But can we do better?

Let’s check if there are better pure strategies.

Suppose you play A0 with probability 1 (pure A0):

Then your expected payoff:
- If other plays A0 (prob q): payoff 5
- If other plays A1 (prob 1−q): payoff 0
→ E = 5q

To maximize: if you believe q is high, this is good.

But if the other player is rational, and you play pure A0, they will best respond.

If you play pure A0 → then other player’s best response:
- A0: payoff 5
- A1: payoff 3
→ So they will play A0.

Then you get 5.

But if you play pure A1:
- Other player, if they play A0 → you get 3
- If they play A1 → you get 3
→ Same payoff.

So if other player plays A0, you get 3; if they play A1, you get 3. So no difference.

But if you play pure A0, and other player plays pure A0 (as best response), you both get 5.

But if you play pure A0, and other player thinks you’re going to play A0, they play A0 → you get 5.

But if the other player wants to minimize *your* payoff? Wait — no, they are rational and want to maximize *their own* payoff.

So if you play A0, they can get 5 by playing A0 (vs 3 if they play A1), so they play A0.

So you get 5.

So playing pure A0 could get you 5.

But only if the other player plays A0.

But if they anticipate that you will play A0, they will play A0 → you get 5.

But what if they play A1?

Then you get 0.

So you must assume they are rational.

But if they are rational, they will choose based on your strategy.

But in equilibrium, we must consider mutual best responses.

Let’s look for pure strategy equilibria.

---

### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria?

Check (A0, A0): You play A0, other plays A0
- You get 5
- Your best response: A0 (vs A1 which gives 3)
- Other player: A0 gives 5, A1 gives 3 → best response
→ So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

Check (A1, A1): You play A1, other plays A1
- You get 3
- Your best response: A1 gives 3, A0 gives 0 → so A1 is best
- Other player: same → A1 is best
→ So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

Check (A0, A1): You play A0, other plays A1
- You get 0
- Is A0 best? If you play A1 → you get 3, which is better → so you want to deviate
→ Not a Nash equilibrium.

Check (A1, A0): You play A1, other plays A0
- You get 3
- Is A1 best? If you play A0 → you get 5, which is better → so you want to deviate
→ Not a Nash equilibrium.

So there are **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

And one mixed strategy equilibrium: (p=0.6, q=0.6)

Now, which one is optimal?

Well, if you can coordinate on (A0, A0), you get 5 → best.

But in a fully non-cooperative setting, with no communication, you cannot coordinate.

But here, the game is simultaneous, no communication.

So you must choose a strategy without knowing what the other player will do.

But since both are rational players, and the game has multiple equilibria, we are in the realm of **equilibrium selection**.

But in such games, the **risk-dominant** equilibrium is often preferred.

Let’s compute the **risk-dominance**.

In a 2x2 game, a strategy is risk-dominant for a player if it gives higher expected payoff when the other player randomizes uniformly.

But more formally: we can compare the **expected payoff** under symmetric mixed strategies.

Alternatively, we can use the concept of **payoff dominance**:

- (A0, A0) gives both 5 → better than (A1, A1) which gives 3.

So (A0, A0) is payoff dominant.

But in a "mixed equilibrium", both A0 and A1 are played with 0.6 probability, and we get 3.

But if you can *influence* the other player to play A0, you can get 5.

But they are rational, so if you play something that induces them to play A0, you're good.

But here’s the key: the other player will not help you — they want to maximize *their* payoff.

So if you play A0, they get 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1 → so they will play A0.

So if you play pure A0, the other player will respond by playing A0 → you get 5.

Similarly, if you play pure A1, they get 3 regardless → so they can play anything.

But if they are rational, and they see that you played A1, they could play A0 (get 0) or A1 (get 3) → so best to play A1.

So if you play A1, they play A1 → you get 3.

So your options:
- Play A0 → they play A0 → you get 5
- Play A1 → they play A1 → you get 3

So obviously, you should play A0.

But wait — is that always true?

Only if the other player is rational and best responds.

But in a game, both are choosing simultaneously — no sequential action.

But in simultaneous move games, equilibrium concepts are about *simultaneous* reasoning.

But if you choose A0 with probability 1, then the rational other player, knowing this, will choose A0 to maximize their payoff (since 5 > 3).

So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, (A1, A1) is also.

But if the other player believes you will play A0, they will play A0.

So if you play **pure A0**, and they are rational, they will play A0 → you get 5.

But is this *credible*? Yes.

But here’s a catch: if you play pure A0, you get 5.

But if you play a mixed strategy, you might do worse.

But can we do better than 5?

No — 5 is maximum possible.

So **if** we can induce the other player to play A0, we get 5.

But the only way to induce that is to play A0 — because if you play A0, they best respond by playing A0.

But what if you play A1?

Then they get 3 no matter what, so they are indifferent — but to maximize expected payoff, if they are unsure, they might play A0 or A1.

But in a Nash equilibrium, if you play A1, they can play either, but in equilibrium, they must play a best response.

If you play pure A1, then:
- If other plays A0 → they get 0
- If other plays A1 → they get 3
→ So best response is A1.

So only (A1, A1) is equilibrium.

But if you play A0, they can get 5 (by A0) or 3 (by A1), so best response is A0.

So (A0, A0) is equilibrium.

Now, can you *force* (A0, A0) by playing A0?

Yes — **if** you play pure A0, and the other player is rational, they will play A0 → you get 5.

Is that true? In a strictly rational setting with common knowledge, yes — the other player anticipates that you are playing A0, and chooses A0 to maximize their payoff.

So you should play pure A0.

But wait — what if the other player does not believe you are rational?

But the problem says: both players are playing to maximize their *own* points.

So we assume both are rational.

Therefore, if you play A0, they will play A0.

So your expected payoff is 5.

But what if you play a mixed strategy?

Suppose you play A0 with probability p.

Then the other player’s best response depends on whether they think you are playing pure A0 or not.

But if you play p < 1, and they believe you are playing mixed, they might not play A0.

For example, if you play p = 0.5, then:

- If other player plays A0: expected payoff = 5*0.5 + 0*0.5 = 2.5
- If other player plays A1: expected payoff = 3*0.5 + 3*0.5 = 3

So they prefer A1 — so will play A1.

Then you get 3 (if you play A0 or A1, since both give 3 when they play A1).

So expected payoff: 3.

But if you play p = 1 (pure A0), then they play A0 → you get 5.

So clearly, playing pure A0 gives you 5, while playing any less than 1 gives you worse (because they switch to A1).

Therefore, **your best response is to play pure A0**.

But wait — what if they are in the mixed equilibrium?

If they are not cooperating, and you are both playing rational strategies, why would you assume they play A0?

But this is a **non-cooperative** setting, but with multiple equilibria.

In such cases, the **equilibrium selection** is tricky.

However, **a player can secure a payoff by choosing a strategy that forces a favorable equilibrium**.

Specifically: choosing **pure A0** forces the other player to choose A0, because otherwise they get less.

So by playing A0 with probability 1, you **induce** the other player to play A0, and thus get 5.

Whereas if you play any mixed strategy with p < 1, the other player gets higher payoff by playing A1 (as shown above), so they will play A1, and you get 3.

So the only way to get 5 is to play **pure A0**.

Therefore, your optimal strategy is to play **A0 with probability 100%**.

### But what about the contract?

The contract was proposed but rejected by Player 1.

And we are told:
> You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

So the contract is inactive.

So no additional payments.

So we ignore the contract.

Thus, the payoff structure is as originally described.

---

### Final Decision

To maximize your payoff, you should play **A0 with probability 100%**.

Because:
- If you play A0, the other rational player will play A0 (since it gives them 5 vs 3 for A1).
- Result: you get 5 points.
- If you play A1, the other player will play A1 (since they get 3 in both cases, but A1 is a best response when you play A1), so you get 3.
- Any mixture with p < 1 allows them to play A1 and get 3 > 2.5 (their expected payoff from playing A0 when you play A0 with p=0.5), so they prefer A1.
- So any p < 1 leads to you getting only 3.

Thus, **pure A0** is optimal.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Let me analyze this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix
From my perspective (Player 2), the payoffs are:

```
                Other Player (Player 1)
                A0      A1
Me (P2)   A0     5       0
          A1     3       3
```

## Step 2: Check for dominant strategies

**If other player chooses A0:**
- I get 5 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → A0 is better

**If other player chooses A1:**
- I get 0 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → A1 is better

Neither action dominates. The same logic applies to the other player (symmetric game).

## Step 3: Find Nash equilibria

**Pure strategy Nash equilibria:**
- **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5. Neither wants to deviate (would get 3). ✓ Nash equilibrium
- **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3. Neither wants to deviate (would get 0). ✓ Nash equilibrium

**Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:**

Let the other player play A0 with probability p.

My expected payoffs:
- From A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- From A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

For indifference: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

By symmetry, the mixed Nash equilibrium is both players choosing A0 with 60% probability.

## Step 4: Choose the best strategy

This is a coordination game with multiple equilibria:
- (A0, A0) = 5 points each (Pareto optimal)
- (A1, A1) = 3 points each (safe)
- Mixed strategy = 3 points expected

The mixed strategy equilibrium (60% A0, 40% A1) serves as a reasonable focal point when there's uncertainty about coordination, and it guarantees an expected payoff of 3 points regardless of what the other player does.

response:
The game is a symmetric coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0), which yields 5 points for each player, and (A1, A1), which yields 3 points for each player. While (A0, A0) is Pareto superior, (A1, A1) is the safer choice because action A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's decision, whereas action A0 is risky and can result in 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

In this scenario, a symmetric payment contract was proposed by Player 2 (me) that would have incentivized choosing A0 by reducing the loss if the other player chose A1. Specifically, it would have provided a 1-point transfer from the player choosing A1 to the player choosing A0. Under this contract, the payoff for choosing A1 when the other player chooses A0 would drop from 3 to 2, and the payoff for choosing A0 when the other player chooses A1 would increase from 0 to 1.

The fact that Player 1 rejected this contract is a strong signal of their intent. By rejecting the contract, Player 1 chose to keep the payoff of 3 points for the (A1, A0) scenario rather than the 2 points they would have received under the contract. Conversely, they gave up a guaranteed 1 point in the (A0, A1) scenario. This rejection strongly suggests that Player 1 intends to play A1, the safe strategy, and wants to maximize their payoff while doing so.

Since Player 1 is highly likely to choose A1, Player 2's best response is also to choose A1. Playing A0 would result in 0 points against A1, whereas playing A1 results in 3 points. Given the signal from Player 1, the probability of them playing A0 is likely well below the 60% threshold required for A0 to be a rational choice for Player 2.

response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate Modified Payoffs with Contract

The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."

With 2 players, this means:
- If I choose A0: I get +2, other player pays -2
- If other chooses A0: They get +2, I pay -2

Modified payoff matrix (my payoffs):

|          | Other A0 | Other A1 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **My A0** | 5+2-2=**5** | 0+2=**2** |
| **My A1** | 3-2=**1** | **3** |

## Step 2: Identify Nash Equilibria

Checking best responses:
- If I play A0 → Other's best response is A0 (5 > 1)
- If I play A1 → Other's best response is A1 (3 > 2)
- If other plays A0 → My best response is A0 (5 > 1)
- If other plays A1 → My best response is A1 (3 > 2)

**Two pure Nash equilibria exist:**
- **(A0, A0) with payoff (5, 5)** ← Pareto optimal
- (A1, A1) with payoff (3, 3)

## Step 3: Determine Optimal Strategy

Key observations:
1. (A0, A0) gives both players the highest possible payoff (5 points)
2. The contract was proposed by Player 2 and appears designed to facilitate coordination on (A0, A0)
3. The contract reduces the risk of playing A0 (payoff of 2 instead of 0 if other defects)
4. There's no profitable deviation from (A0, A0)

Expected value analysis:
- If I believe other plays A0 with probability p:
  - EV(A0) = 5p + 2(1-p) = 3p + 2
  - EV(A1) = 1p + 3(1-p) = 3 - 2p
  - A0 is better when p > 0.2 (20%)

Given the contract design and that Player 2 proposed it, they likely intend to coordinate on the Pareto-optimal (A0, A0) outcome. Playing A0 maximizes my expected payoff.

	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 1

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without the Contract**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):

|              | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)        | (0, 3)        |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)        | (3, 3)        |

This is a classic coordination game with a twist.

- If both play A0: both get 5 (best outcome).
- If one plays A0 and the other A1: the A0 player gets 0, A1 player gets 3.
- If both play A1: both get 3.

So, there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

But (A0, A0) is better for both.

However, there is a risk: if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0 — a big penalty.

---

### **Step 2: Evaluate the Contract (Even Though It's Not Active)**

The contract was proposed by Player 1, but **Player 1 rejected it**, so it is **not in effect**.

But let's review it anyway to understand the context:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+1 point**, drawn **equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, they **pay -1 point**, distributed equally among the other players.

That is:
- Choosing A0 → +1 (financed by others)
- Choosing A1 → -1 (paid by you, shared with others)

But since **Player 1 rejected it**, this **does not apply**.

So we **ignore** the contract. The game is purely the original payoff matrix.

---

### **Step 3: Dominant Strategies?**

Let’s check for dominant strategies.

For Player 1:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - A0 gives 5
  - A1 gives 3 → A0 better
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - A0 gives 0
  - A1 gives 3 → A1 better

So no dominant strategy for Player 1.

Same for Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (5) over A1 (3)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A1 (3) over A0 (0)

So again, no dominant strategy.

---

### **Step 4: Find Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium**

We now look for a **mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium**, where each player randomizes to make the other indifferent.

Let:
- Player 1 play A0 with probability p
- Player 2 play A0 with probability q

We want to find p such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

**Player 2’s expected payoff:**
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - With prob p: Player 1 plays A0 → payoff = 5
  - With prob (1-p): Player 1 plays A1 → payoff = 0
  - Expected: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - With prob p: Player 1 plays A0 → payoff = 3
  - With prob (1-p): Player 1 plays A1 → payoff = 3
  - Expected: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set them equal for indifference:
> 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So in equilibrium, Player 1 plays A0 with probability **60%**, A1 with **40%**.

Now, check if Player 2 is also indifferent when playing A0 or A1, given that Player 1 plays 60% A0.

Compute Player 2’s payoff from A0 and A1 when Player 1 plays p = 0.6:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Prob P1=A0: 0.6 → payoff = 5
  - Prob P1=A1: 0.4 → payoff = 0
  - Expected: 0.6×5 + 0.4×0 = 3

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Prob P1=A0: 0.6 → payoff = 3
  - Prob P1=A1: 0.4 → payoff = 3
  - Expected: 3×1 = 3

So yes — indifferent. Therefore, at p = 0.6, Player 2 is willing to mix.

Thus, in symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium (which is likely the only proper one, since the game is symmetric), both players should play A0 with 60% probability.

But wait — is this the **only** equilibrium?

We have:
- Pure equilibrium: (A0, A0): both get 5
- Pure equilibrium: (A1, A1): both get 3
- Mixed equilibrium: both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%

In the mixed equilibrium, expected payoff for Player 1 is:

> p(A0) × [q(A0)×5 + q(A1)×0] + p(A1) × [q(A0)×3 + q(A1)×3]
But since q = 0.6, and p = 0.6:

= 0.6 × (0.6×5 + 0.4×0) + 0.4 × (0.6×3 + 0.4×3)
= 0.6 × (3) + 0.4 × (3)
= 1.8 + 1.2 = **3.0**

So expected payoff is 3.0

But in (A0, A0), it’s 5 — better. So why would a rational player choose the mixed equilibrium?

However, if Player 1 thinks the other player might not commit to A0, then playing A0 could be dangerous (risk of getting 0). So rational players may be cautious.

But since we are **maximizing our own expected points**, and both players are rational, we need to consider **which equilibrium to play**.

In game theory, if there are multiple equilibria, the most plausible one depends on **focal points** or **risk dominance**.

Let’s compare the two pure equilibria:
- (A0, A0): payoff (5,5) — Pareto optimal, best outcome
- (A1, A1): payoff (3,3) — worse for both

But (A0, A0) is risky if you’re not sure the other player will cooperate.

(A1, A1) is safe: regardless of what the other does, you get 3.

But in the **mixed** equilibrium, you get 3 on average — same as (A1,A1).

But (A0, A0) gives 5 — much better, but only if both play A0.

So the **key** is: **can we coordinate on (A0, A0)?**

But in this game, **no communication** is allowed beyond choosing your own strategy.

So if you play pure A0, you risk getting 0.

If you play A1, you guarantee at least 3, but never get 5.

Now, suppose **both players are rational and know this**.

In that case, both might think: “If the other plays A0, I should play A0 to get 5. But if they play A1, I should play A1 to avoid 0.”

But if both think that way, they might be driven toward **(A1, A1)**.

However, in symmetric games like this, people often **coordinate on the payoff-dominant equilibrium (A0,A0)** if they can **focus** on it.

But without communication, is (A0, A0) a reasonable expectation?

Back to the **mixed-strategy equilibrium** — it’s **symmetric and stable**.

In fact, in the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, both players playing A0 with 60% chance, A1 with 40%, gives expected payoff of **3** — which is **exactly** what you get from the (A1,A1) pure equilibrium.

But (A0,A0) gives 5 — better.

So why not try to play A0 with high probability?

Because if you play A0 with high probability, say 90%, and the other player plays A0 with 60%, then:
- Your expected payoff:
  - With 60% chance other plays A0: you get 5 → 0.6×5 = 3.0
  - With 40% chance other plays A1: you get 0 → 0.4×0 = 0
  - Total: 3.0

Same as before — but now you have a big risk.

But if you **don’t** play the mixed strategy, you're vulnerable.

But the **correct equilibrium in this game is the mixed-strategy one**, and it's symmetric and stable.

Wait — actually, there's another possibility: both players might play **A0 with 100%**, but only if they trust the other.

But in the absence of communication, and without knowing the other's strategy, the **only symmetric Nash equilibrium that is robust** is the mixed one.

Let’s check more carefully.

Suppose both players believe the other will play A0 with p.

Player 1’s best response:
- Expected payoff from playing A0: p×5 + (1-p)×0 = 5p
- Expected payoff from playing A1: p×3 + (1-p)×3 = 3
- So play A0 if 5p > 3 → p > 3/5 = 0.6
- Play A1 if p < 0.6
- Indifferent if p = 0.6

So symmetric Nash equilibrium: both play A0 with 60% → indifference.

This is the **only symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium**.

Now, are there asymmetric ones? Possibly, but messy.

In practice, for such games, the **mixed-strategy equilibrium is the one rational players would converge to if they're unsure**.

Moreover, **(A0, A0)** is not a Nash equilibrium if the other player is not certain to play A0.

Wait: actually, **(A0, A0)** **is** a Nash equilibrium:
- If P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A0 (5 vs 3)
- So yes, (A0,A0) is a pure-strategy NE.

Similarly, (A1,A1) is a NE: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 from A1 and 0 from A0 → prefers A1.

So there are **three** Nash equilibria:
1. (A0, A0) — payoff (5,5)
2. (A1, A1) — payoff (3,3)
3. Mixed: both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40% — payoff 3 each

Which one do we pick?

Now, **risk dominance** helps.

In a 2x2 game, the risk-dominant equilibrium is the one that is more likely to be played under uncertainty.

To check risk dominance:
- The expected payoff of A0 (relative to A1) is higher if the other player plays A0 more than 0.6.
- The equilibrium (A0, A0) is **risk dominant** if it is more forgiving of mistakes.

In this game, (A0, A0) is **risk dominant** because:
- The payoff from (A0,A0) is high, and even if one player deviates, they don’t gain much.
- But if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you lose a lot (0), so it's risky.

But let’s compute **the condition for risk dominance**.

Standard method: compare the expected payoff from playing A0 vs A1 when the opponent plays randomly.

But here’s a simpler rule: an equilibrium is risk dominant if the other player is more likely to play it.

But in the absence of commitment, people often **tend to play the payoff-dominant equilibrium**, especially if it’s symmetric and feasible.

But in this case, (A0,A0) gives 5 to both — best possible.

But if both players have an incentive to deviate?

No: in (A0,A0), no one has incentive to deviate → it’s an equilibrium.

So if we can **coordinate**, we should do so.

But can we?

In the **absence of communication**, rational players might avoid the risk.

But in this game, because the payoff from (A0,A0) is so high, and the only downside is if the other plays A1, very few players would risk A0.

But suppose both players are perfectly rational, and they know that (A0,A0) is better.

Then **why wouldn’t they both play A0?**

But here’s the insight: **if I play A0, and you play A0, we both get 5 — great.**

But if I play A0 and you play A1, I get 0 — terrible.

So I might fear that you might play A1.

But if **you** are rational and know that playing A1 gives 3, but playing A0 gives 3 only if I play A1? No — if I play A0 and you play A1, you get 3 — better than if you played A0 (5) — only if I play A0.

Wait: if you play A0 and I play A0 → you get 5
If you play A0 and I play A1 → you get 3
If you play A1 and I play A0 → you get 3
If you play A1 and I play A1 → you get 3

So from your perspective:
- If I play A0 → you should play A0 for 5
- If I play A1 → you get 3 regardless — so indifferent

So your best response to my A0 is A0.

So if you think I might play A0, you should do so.

But if you think I might play A1, you’re indifferent.

So **if you believe I am likely to play A0**, you should play A0.

But **if you think I am not** playing A0, you might as well play A1.

So there's a coordination problem.

Now, if both players are rational and know the game, and believe the other is rational, then they might reason:

> “If the other plays A0, I get 5 by playing A0, so I should.”
> “If the other plays A1, I get 3 anyway, so it doesn’t matter.”
> “But I prefer to get 5 — so I should play A0.”

And they both reason this → both play A0.

So (A0, A0) is **focal**.

This is a **common knowledge of rationality** argument.

In such games, like this one (similar to Stag Hunt), the **payoff-dominant equilibrium (A0,A0)** is usually selected.

Moreover, in practice, people often coordinate on it.

Given that, and since we are **maximizing our own points**, the optimal strategy is to **play A0 with high probability** — **preferably 100%**, **if we believe the other player will too**.

But do we?

The twist is that the contract was proposed by Player 1, but **rejected by Player 1** — so the player knows about the contract but rejected it.

Why might Player 1 reject the contract?

The contract:
- If you play A0: +1, funded by others
- If you play A1: -1, paid to others

So **this contract penalizes A1 and rewards A0**

But Player 1 **rejected** it.

Why would a player reject a contract that makes A0 better and A1 worse?

Because:
- If the contract were active, playing A0 would be even more attractive.
- But by rejecting it, Player 1 is signaling that they don’t want to be bound by such incentives.
- But more importantly: perhaps Player 1 **doesn’t trust the other player** to follow through.

But in this case, the contract is inactive.

So now, we return to the original game.

**Crucial insight**: Player 1 (you) **rejected** the contract, which itself suggests **you don’t trust coordination** — because if you believed in A0, you’d want the contract to make it more attractive.

So by rejecting the contract, you are **withdrawing support for rewarding A0**.

Therefore, you may be less confident in coordinating on A0.

Moreover, rejecting a contract that rewards A0 and penalizes A1 suggests that **you are skeptical of mutual cooperation** — perhaps because you fear the other player will exploit you.

So, if you’re risk-averse, you might prefer the **safe** strategy.

But the only safe strategy is playing A1?

No — playing A1 gives 3 for sure **only if the other player plays A1**.

But if you play A1 and the other plays A0, you get 3 — still not bad.

Wait: no issue with A1 — you get 3 in both cases.

But if you play A0 and other plays A1, you get 0.

So A0 is risky.

A1 is safe.

So in a **risk-averse** mindset, playing A1 is better.

But we want to **maximize expected points**.

So if we think the other player is likely to play A0, we should play A0.

But if not, better to play A1.

Now, recall: **Player 1 (you) rejected the contract**.

The contract was **proposed by Player 1**, so it was self-interested.

But rejecting it suggests that **you think the contract is not beneficial**, or you don’t trust cooperation.

But the contract benefits A0 and hurts A1 — so why reject it?

Possibility: you expect the other player to **play A1**, so you don't want the +1 bonus for A0 (because you wouldn’t get it), and you would instead have to pay for the A1 choice.

Wait — no: the payment is drawn from others.

If you play A0, you get +1 — comes from others.

So you get money regardless — but it's taken from others.

So the contract gives you a **bonus for playing A0**, regardless of whether you win.

So like a subsidy.

So **as a player, you want the contract** — it makes A0 better.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without the Contract**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):

|              | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)        | (0, 3)        |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)        | (3, 3)        |

This is a classic coordination game with a twist.

- If both play A0: both get 5 (best outcome).
- If one plays A0 and the other A1: the A0 player gets 0, A1 player gets 3.
- If both play A1: both get 3.

So, there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

But (A0, A0) is better for both.

However, there is a risk: if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0 — a big penalty.

---

### **Step 2: Evaluate the Contract (Even Though It's Not Active)**

The contract was proposed by Player 1, but **Player 1 rejected it**, so it is **not in effect**.

But let's review it anyway to understand the context:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+1 point**, drawn **equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, they **pay -1 point**, distributed equally among the other players.

That is:
- Choosing A0 → +1 (financed by others)
- Choosing A1 → -1 (paid by you, shared with others)

But since **Player 1 rejected it**, this **does not apply**.

So we **ignore** the contract. The game is purely the original payoff matrix.

---

### **Step 3: Dominant Strategies?**

Let’s check for dominant strategies.

For Player 1:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - A0 gives 5
  - A1 gives 3 → A0 better
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - A0 gives 0
  - A1 gives 3 → A1 better

So no dominant strategy for Player 1.

Same for Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (5) over A1 (3)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A1 (3) over A0 (0)

So again, no dominant strategy.

---

### **Step 4: Find Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium**

We now look for a **mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium**, where each player randomizes to make the other indifferent.

Let:
- Player 1 play A0 with probability p
- Player 2 play A0 with probability q

We want to find p such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

**Player 2’s expected payoff:**
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - With prob p: Player 1 plays A0 → payoff = 5
  - With prob (1-p): Player 1 plays A1 → payoff = 0
  - Expected: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - With prob p: Player 1 plays A0 → payoff = 3
  - With prob (1-p): Player 1 plays A1 → payoff = 3
  - Expected: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set them equal for indifference:
> 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So in equilibrium, Player 1 plays A0 with probability **60%**, A1 with **40%**.

Now, check if Player 2 is also indifferent when playing A0 or A1, given that Player 1 plays 60% A0.

Compute Player 2’s payoff from A0 and A1 when Player 1 plays p = 0.6:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Prob P1=A0: 0.6 → payoff = 5
  - Prob P1=A1: 0.4 → payoff = 0
  - Expected: 0.6×5 + 0.4×0 = 3

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Prob P1=A0: 0.6 → payoff = 3
  - Prob P1=A1: 0.4 → payoff = 3
  - Expected: 3×1 = 3

So yes — indifferent. Therefore, at p = 0.6, Player 2 is willing to mix.

Thus, in symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium (which is likely the only proper one, since the game is symmetric), both players should play A0 with 60% probability.

But wait — is this the **only** equilibrium?

We have:
- Pure equilibrium: (A0, A0): both get 5
- Pure equilibrium: (A1, A1): both get 3
- Mixed equilibrium: both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%

In the mixed equilibrium, expected payoff for Player 1 is:

> p(A0) × [q(A0)×5 + q(A1)×0] + p(A1) × [q(A0)×3 + q(A1)×3]
But since q = 0.6, and p = 0.6:

= 0.6 × (0.6×5 + 0.4×0) + 0.4 × (0.6×3 + 0.4×3)
= 0.6 × (3) + 0.4 × (3)
= 1.8 + 1.2 = **3.0**

So expected payoff is 3.0

But in (A0, A0), it’s 5 — better. So why would a rational player choose the mixed equilibrium?

However, if Player 1 thinks the other player might not commit to A0, then playing A0 could be dangerous (risk of getting 0). So rational players may be cautious.

But since we are **maximizing our own expected points**, and both players are rational, we need to consider **which equilibrium to play**.

In game theory, if there are multiple equilibria, the most plausible one depends on **focal points** or **risk dominance**.

Let’s compare the two pure equilibria:
- (A0, A0): payoff (5,5) — Pareto optimal, best outcome
- (A1, A1): payoff (3,3) — worse for both

But (A0, A0) is risky if you’re not sure the other player will cooperate.

(A1, A1) is safe: regardless of what the other does, you get 3.

But in the **mixed** equilibrium, you get 3 on average — same as (A1,A1).

But (A0, A0) gives 5 — much better, but only if both play A0.

So the **key** is: **can we coordinate on (A0, A0)?**

But in this game, **no communication** is allowed beyond choosing your own strategy.

So if you play pure A0, you risk getting 0.

If you play A1, you guarantee at least 3, but never get 5.

Now, suppose **both players are rational and know this**.

In that case, both might think: “If the other plays A0, I should play A0 to get 5. But if they play A1, I should play A1 to avoid 0.”

But if both think that way, they might be driven toward **(A1, A1)**.

However, in symmetric games like this, people often **coordinate on the payoff-dominant equilibrium (A0,A0)** if they can **focus** on it.

But without communication, is (A0, A0) a reasonable expectation?

Back to the **mixed-strategy equilibrium** — it’s **symmetric and stable**.

In fact, in the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, both players playing A0 with 60% chance, A1 with 40%, gives expected payoff of **3** — which is **exactly** what you get from the (A1,A1) pure equilibrium.

But (A0,A0) gives 5 — better.

So why not try to play A0 with high probability?

Because if you play A0 with high probability, say 90%, and the other player plays A0 with 60%, then:
- Your expected payoff:
  - With 60% chance other plays A0: you get 5 → 0.6×5 = 3.0
  - With 40% chance other plays A1: you get 0 → 0.4×0 = 0
  - Total: 3.0

Same as before — but now you have a big risk.

But if you **don’t** play the mixed strategy, you're vulnerable.

But the **correct equilibrium in this game is the mixed-strategy one**, and it's symmetric and stable.

Wait — actually, there's another possibility: both players might play **A0 with 100%**, but only if they trust the other.

But in the absence of communication, and without knowing the other's strategy, the **only symmetric Nash equilibrium that is robust** is the mixed one.

Let’s check more carefully.

Suppose both players believe the other will play A0 with p.

Player 1’s best response:
- Expected payoff from playing A0: p×5 + (1-p)×0 = 5p
- Expected payoff from playing A1: p×3 + (1-p)×3 = 3
- So play A0 if 5p > 3 → p > 3/5 = 0.6
- Play A1 if p < 0.6
- Indifferent if p = 0.6

So symmetric Nash equilibrium: both play A0 with 60% → indifference.

This is the **only symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium**.

Now, are there asymmetric ones? Possibly, but messy.

In practice, for such games, the **mixed-strategy equilibrium is the one rational players would converge to if they're unsure**.

Moreover, **(A0, A0)** is not a Nash equilibrium if the other player is not certain to play A0.

Wait: actually, **(A0, A0)** **is** a Nash equilibrium:
- If P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A0 (5 vs 3)
- So yes, (A0,A0) is a pure-strategy NE.

Similarly, (A1,A1) is a NE: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 from A1 and 0 from A0 → prefers A1.

So there are **three** Nash equilibria:
1. (A0, A0) — payoff (5,5)
2. (A1, A1) — payoff (3,3)
3. Mixed: both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40% — payoff 3 each

Which one do we pick?

Now, **risk dominance** helps.

In a 2x2 game, the risk-dominant equilibrium is the one that is more likely to be played under uncertainty.

To check risk dominance:
- The expected payoff of A0 (relative to A1) is higher if the other player plays A0 more than 0.6.
- The equilibrium (A0, A0) is **risk dominant** if it is more forgiving of mistakes.

In this game, (A0, A0) is **risk dominant** because:
- The payoff from (A0,A0) is high, and even if one player deviates, they don’t gain much.
- But if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you lose a lot (0), so it's risky.

But let’s compute **the condition for risk dominance**.

Standard method: compare the expected payoff from playing A0 vs A1 when the opponent plays randomly.

But here’s a simpler rule: an equilibrium is risk dominant if the other player is more likely to play it.

But in the absence of commitment, people often **tend to play the payoff-dominant equilibrium**, especially if it’s symmetric and feasible.

But in this case, (A0,A0) gives 5 to both — best possible.

But if both players have an incentive to deviate?

No: in (A0,A0), no one has incentive to deviate → it’s an equilibrium.

So if we can **coordinate**, we should do so.

But can we?

In the **absence of communication**, rational players might avoid the risk.

But in this game, because the payoff from (A0,A0) is so high, and the only downside is if the other plays A1, very few players would risk A0.

But suppose both players are perfectly rational, and they know that (A0,A0) is better.

Then **why wouldn’t they both play A0?**

But here’s the insight: **if I play A0, and you play A0, we both get 5 — great.**

But if I play A0 and you play A1, I get 0 — terrible.

So I might fear that you might play A1.

But if **you** are rational and know that playing A1 gives 3, but playing A0 gives 3 only if I play A1? No — if I play A0 and you play A1, you get 3 — better than if you played A0 (5) — only if I play A0.

Wait: if you play A0 and I play A0 → you get 5
If you play A0 and I play A1 → you get 3
If you play A1 and I play A0 → you get 3
If you play A1 and I play A1 → you get 3

So from your perspective:
- If I play A0 → you should play A0 for 5
- If I play A1 → you get 3 regardless — so indifferent

So your best response to my A0 is A0.

So if you think I might play A0, you should do so.

But if you think I might play A1, you’re indifferent.

So **if you believe I am likely to play A0**, you should play A0.

But **if you think I am not** playing A0, you might as well play A1.

So there's a coordination problem.

Now, if both players are rational and know the game, and believe the other is rational, then they might reason:

> “If the other plays A0, I get 5 by playing A0, so I should.”
> “If the other plays A1, I get 3 anyway, so it doesn’t matter.”
> “But I prefer to get 5 — so I should play A0.”

And they both reason this → both play A0.

So (A0, A0) is **focal**.

This is a **common knowledge of rationality** argument.

In such games, like this one (similar to Stag Hunt), the **payoff-dominant equilibrium (A0,A0)** is usually selected.

Moreover, in practice, people often coordinate on it.

Given that, and since we are **maximizing our own points**, the optimal strategy is to **play A0 with high probability** — **preferably 100%**, **if we believe the other player will too**.

But do we?

The twist is that the contract was proposed by Player 1, but **rejected by Player 1** — so the player knows about the contract but rejected it.

Why might Player 1 reject the contract?

The contract:
- If you play A0: +1, funded by others
- If you play A1: -1, paid to others

So **this contract penalizes A1 and rewards A0**

But Player 1 **rejected** it.

Why would a player reject a contract that makes A0 better and A1 worse?

Because:
- If the contract were active, playing A0 would be even more attractive.
- But by rejecting it, Player 1 is signaling that they don’t want to be bound by such incentives.
- But more importantly: perhaps Player 1 **doesn’t trust the other player** to follow through.

But in this case, the contract is inactive.

So now, we return to the original game.

**Crucial insight**: Player 1 (you) **rejected** the contract, which itself suggests **you don’t trust coordination** — because if you believed in A0, you’d want the contract to make it more attractive.

So by rejecting the contract, you are **withdrawing support for rewarding A0**.

Therefore, you may be less confident in coordinating on A0.

Moreover, rejecting a contract that rewards A0 and penalizes A1 suggests that **you are skeptical of mutual cooperation** — perhaps because you fear the other player will exploit you.

So, if you’re risk-averse, you might prefer the **safe** strategy.

But the only safe strategy is playing A1?

No — playing A1 gives 3 for sure **only if the other player plays A1**.

But if you play A1 and the other plays A0, you get 3 — still not bad.

Wait: no issue with A1 — you get 3 in both cases.

But if you play A0 and other plays A1, you get 0.

So A0 is risky.

A1 is safe.

So in a **risk-averse** mindset, playing A1 is better.

But we want to **maximize expected points**.

So if we think the other player is likely to play A0, we should play A0.

But if not, better to play A1.

Now, recall: **Player 1 (you) rejected the contract**.

The contract was **proposed by Player 1**, so it was self-interested.

But rejecting it suggests that **you think the contract is not beneficial**, or you don’t trust cooperation.

But the contract benefits A0 and hurts A1 — so why reject it?

Possibility: you expect the other player to **play A1**, so you don't want the +1 bonus for A0 (because you wouldn’t get it), and you would instead have to pay for the A1 choice.

Wait — no: the payment is drawn from others.

If you play A0, you get +1 — comes from others.

So you get money regardless — but it's taken from others.

So the contract gives you a **bonus for playing A0**, regardless of whether you win.

So like a subsidy.

So **as a player, you want the contract** — it makes A0 better.



That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in the response "Let's break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without the Contract**\n\nWe are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.\n\nPayoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):\n\n|              | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)        | (0, 3)        |\n| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)        | (3, 3)        |\n\nThis is a classic coordination game with a twist.\n\n- If both play A0: both get 5 (best outcome).\n- If one plays A0 and the other A1: the A0 player gets 0, A1 player gets 3.\n- If both play A1: both get 3.\n\nSo, there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria:\n- (A0, A0): both get 5\n- (A1, A1): both get 3\n\nBut (A0, A0) is better for both.\n\nHowever, there is a risk: if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0 — a big penalty.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate the Contract (Even Though It's Not Active)**\n\nThe contract was proposed by Player 1, but **Player 1 rejected it**, so it is **not in effect**.\n\nBut let's review it anyway to understand the context:\n\n> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+1 point**, drawn **equally from the other players**.\n> - If a player chooses A1, they **pay -1 point**, distributed equally among the other players.\n\nThat is:\n- Choosing A0 → +1 (financed by others)\n- Choosing A1 → -1 (paid by you, shared with others)\n\nBut since **Player 1 rejected it**, this **does not apply**.\n\nSo we **ignore** the contract. The game is purely the original payoff matrix.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Dominant Strategies?**\n\nLet’s check for dominant strategies.\n\nFor Player 1:\n- If Player 2 plays A0:\n  - A0 gives 5\n  - A1 gives 3 → A0 better\n- If Player 2 plays A1:\n  - A0 gives 0\n  - A1 gives 3 → A1 better\n\nSo no dominant strategy for Player 1.\n\nSame for Player 2:\n- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (5) over A1 (3)\n- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A1 (3) over A0 (0)\n\nSo again, no dominant strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Find Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium**\n\nWe now look for a **mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium**, where each player randomizes to make the other indifferent.\n\nLet:\n- Player 1 play A0 with probability p\n- Player 2 play A0 with probability q\n\nWe want to find p such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\n**Player 2’s expected payoff:**\n- If Player 2 plays A0:\n  - With prob p: Player 1 plays A0 → payoff = 5\n  - With prob (1-p): Player 1 plays A1 → payoff = 0\n  - Expected: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p\n\n- If Player 2 plays A1:\n  - With prob p: Player 1 plays A0 → payoff = 3\n  - With prob (1-p): Player 1 plays A1 → payoff = 3\n  - Expected: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3\n\nSet them equal for indifference:\n> 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nSo in equilibrium, Player 1 plays A0 with probability **60%**, A1 with **40%**.\n\nNow, check if Player 2 is also indifferent when playing A0 or A1, given that Player 1 plays 60% A0.\n\nCompute Player 2’s payoff from A0 and A1 when Player 1 plays p = 0.6:\n\n- If Player 2 plays A0:\n  - Prob P1=A0: 0.6 → payoff = 5\n  - Prob P1=A1: 0.4 → payoff = 0\n  - Expected: 0.6×5 + 0.4×0 = 3\n\n- If Player 2 plays A1:\n  - Prob P1=A0: 0.6 → payoff = 3\n  - Prob P1=A1: 0.4 → payoff = 3\n  - Expected: 3×1 = 3\n\nSo yes — indifferent. Therefore, at p = 0.6, Player 2 is willing to mix.\n\nThus, in symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium (which is likely the only proper one, since the game is symmetric), both players should play A0 with 60% probability.\n\nBut wait — is this the **only** equilibrium?\n\nWe have:\n- Pure equilibrium: (A0, A0): both get 5\n- Pure equilibrium: (A1, A1): both get 3\n- Mixed equilibrium: both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%\n\nIn the mixed equilibrium, expected payoff for Player 1 is:\n\n> p(A0) × [q(A0)×5 + q(A1)×0] + p(A1) × [q(A0)×3 + q(A1)×3]\nBut since q = 0.6, and p = 0.6:\n\n= 0.6 × (0.6×5 + 0.4×0) + 0.4 × (0.6×3 + 0.4×3)\n= 0.6 × (3) + 0.4 × (3)\n= 1.8 + 1.2 = **3.0**\n\nSo expected payoff is 3.0\n\nBut in (A0, A0), it’s 5 — better. So why would a rational player choose the mixed equilibrium?\n\nHowever, if Player 1 thinks the other player might not commit to A0, then playing A0 could be dangerous (risk of getting 0). So rational players may be cautious.\n\nBut since we are **maximizing our own expected points**, and both players are rational, we need to consider **which equilibrium to play**.\n\nIn game theory, if there are multiple equilibria, the most plausible one depends on **focal points** or **risk dominance**.\n\nLet’s compare the two pure equilibria:\n- (A0, A0): payoff (5,5) — Pareto optimal, best outcome\n- (A1, A1): payoff (3,3) — worse for both\n\nBut (A0, A0) is risky if you’re not sure the other player will cooperate.\n\n(A1, A1) is safe: regardless of what the other does, you get 3.\n\nBut in the **mixed** equilibrium, you get 3 on average — same as (A1,A1).\n\nBut (A0, A0) gives 5 — much better, but only if both play A0.\n\nSo the **key** is: **can we coordinate on (A0, A0)?**\n\nBut in this game, **no communication** is allowed beyond choosing your own strategy.\n\nSo if you play pure A0, you risk getting 0.\n\nIf you play A1, you guarantee at least 3, but never get 5.\n\nNow, suppose **both players are rational and know this**.\n\nIn that case, both might think: “If the other plays A0, I should play A0 to get 5. But if they play A1, I should play A1 to avoid 0.”\n\nBut if both think that way, they might be driven toward **(A1, A1)**.\n\nHowever, in symmetric games like this, people often **coordinate on the payoff-dominant equilibrium (A0,A0)** if they can **focus** on it.\n\nBut without communication, is (A0, A0) a reasonable expectation?\n\nBack to the **mixed-strategy equilibrium** — it’s **symmetric and stable**.\n\nIn fact, in the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, both players playing A0 with 60% chance, A1 with 40%, gives expected payoff of **3** — which is **exactly** what you get from the (A1,A1) pure equilibrium.\n\nBut (A0,A0) gives 5 — better.\n\nSo why not try to play A0 with high probability?\n\nBecause if you play A0 with high probability, say 90%, and the other player plays A0 with 60%, then:\n- Your expected payoff:\n  - With 60% chance other plays A0: you get 5 → 0.6×5 = 3.0\n  - With 40% chance other plays A1: you get 0 → 0.4×0 = 0\n  - Total: 3.0\n\nSame as before — but now you have a big risk.\n\nBut if you **don’t** play the mixed strategy, you're vulnerable.\n\nBut the **correct equilibrium in this game is the mixed-strategy one**, and it's symmetric and stable.\n\nWait — actually, there's another possibility: both players might play **A0 with 100%**, but only if they trust the other.\n\nBut in the absence of communication, and without knowing the other's strategy, the **only symmetric Nash equilibrium that is robust** is the mixed one.\n\nLet’s check more carefully.\n\nSuppose both players believe the other will play A0 with p.\n\nPlayer 1’s best response:\n- Expected payoff from playing A0: p×5 + (1-p)×0 = 5p\n- Expected payoff from playing A1: p×3 + (1-p)×3 = 3\n- So play A0 if 5p > 3 → p > 3/5 = 0.6\n- Play A1 if p < 0.6\n- Indifferent if p = 0.6\n\nSo symmetric Nash equilibrium: both play A0 with 60% → indifference.\n\nThis is the **only symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium**.\n\nNow, are there asymmetric ones? Possibly, but messy.\n\nIn practice, for such games, the **mixed-strategy equilibrium is the one rational players would converge to if they're unsure**.\n\nMoreover, **(A0, A0)** is not a Nash equilibrium if the other player is not certain to play A0.\n\nWait: actually, **(A0, A0)** **is** a Nash equilibrium:\n- If P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A0 (5 vs 3)\n- So yes, (A0,A0) is a pure-strategy NE.\n\nSimilarly, (A1,A1) is a NE: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 from A1 and 0 from A0 → prefers A1.\n\nSo there are **three** Nash equilibria:\n1. (A0, A0) — payoff (5,5)\n2. (A1, A1) — payoff (3,3)\n3. Mixed: both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40% — payoff 3 each\n\nWhich one do we pick?\n\nNow, **risk dominance** helps.\n\nIn a 2x2 game, the risk-dominant equilibrium is the one that is more likely to be played under uncertainty.\n\nTo check risk dominance:\n- The expected payoff of A0 (relative to A1) is higher if the other player plays A0 more than 0.6.\n- The equilibrium (A0, A0) is **risk dominant** if it is more forgiving of mistakes.\n\nIn this game, (A0, A0) is **risk dominant** because:\n- The payoff from (A0,A0) is high, and even if one player deviates, they don’t gain much.\n- But if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you lose a lot (0), so it's risky.\n\nBut let’s compute **the condition for risk dominance**.\n\nStandard method: compare the expected payoff from playing A0 vs A1 when the opponent plays randomly.\n\nBut here’s a simpler rule: an equilibrium is risk dominant if the other player is more likely to play it.\n\nBut in the absence of commitment, people often **tend to play the payoff-dominant equilibrium**, especially if it’s symmetric and feasible.\n\nBut in this case, (A0,A0) gives 5 to both — best possible.\n\nBut if both players have an incentive to deviate?\n\nNo: in (A0,A0), no one has incentive to deviate → it’s an equilibrium.\n\nSo if we can **coordinate**, we should do so.\n\nBut can we?\n\nIn the **absence of communication**, rational players might avoid the risk.\n\nBut in this game, because the payoff from (A0,A0) is so high, and the only downside is if the other plays A1, very few players would risk A0.\n\nBut suppose both players are perfectly rational, and they know that (A0,A0) is better.\n\nThen **why wouldn’t they both play A0?**\n\nBut here’s the insight: **if I play A0, and you play A0, we both get 5 — great.**\n\nBut if I play A0 and you play A1, I get 0 — terrible.\n\nSo I might fear that you might play A1.\n\nBut if **you** are rational and know that playing A1 gives 3, but playing A0 gives 3 only if I play A1?

Let's carefully re-analyze the game step by step, focusing on maximizing your expected points under rational play, while respecting the instruction to output only a valid JSON object at the end.

---

### **Step 1: Game Structure and Payoffs**

We are Player 1 in a symmetric 2-player simultaneous game with actions:
- A0
- A1

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs. Player 2):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

- If both play A0 → 5 each.
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3.
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0.
- If both play A1 → 3 each.

This is a **coordination game with a risk** — A0 offers a higher payoff if both coordinate, but gives you 0 if mismatched.

---

### **Step 2: Equilibria Analysis**

There are three Nash equilibria:

1. **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5 — Pareto optimal.
2. **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3 — safe, low risk.
3. **Mixed-strategy equilibrium**: Both play A0 with probability 60%, A1 with 40%.

In the mixed-strategy equilibrium:
- Expected payoff for each player = 3.0 (as calculated earlier).
- It is symmetric and self-enforcing: neither player wants to deviate unilaterally.

---

### **Step 3: The Contract Rejection – Key Insight**

The contract was proposed by **Player 1** (you), but **you rejected it**.

Contract terms:
- Play A0 → +1 point, funded by others (i.e., distributed equally among opponents).
- Play A1 → -1 point, paid by you and shared with others.

So, **the contract makes A0 more attractive and A1 less attractive**.

Yet **you rejected it**.

Why?

If you were confident that mutual cooperation (A0,A0) would occur, you'd want the contract to make A0 even more favorable — it’s a self-serving incentive.

Rejecting a contract that rewards A0 and penalizes A1 suggests **a lack of trust** in coordination.

In particular:
- You don't believe the other player will cooperate.
- You fear being exploited (i.e., playing A0 while they play A1 → you get 0).
- Thus, you reject a mechanism that increases the value of cooperation.

This rejection is **behavioral evidence** that you are **risk-averse** or **uncertain about the other player's strategy**.

Therefore, **favoring A0 is risky**, and since you're rejecting incentives for A0, you likely think A0 is too dangerous.

Hence, you should **avoid high-risk strategies like pure A0**.

---

### **Step 4: Optimal Strategy Under Uncertainty**

Given:
- You are risk-sensitive due to rejecting the A0-incentive contract.
- You want to **maximize expected points**, not just achieve 5.
- Without communication, you cannot assume the other player will play A0.

Best option: **play A1**, which guarantees a minimum of 3, regardless of what the other does:
- If P2 plays A0 → you get 3 (from A1)
- If P2 plays A1 → you get 3 (from A1)

So **A1 is a safe choice** — yields **constant 3**.

But can we do better? Only if we believe the other player is also playing A0.

But your rejection of the contract suggests **you don’t trust that**.

So **assuming symmetry and rationality**, the other player may also be cautious and avoid A0.

Thus, **(A1, A1)** is the safest *consistent* outcome.

Moreover, in the **mixed-strategy equilibrium**, both players play A0 60% of the time — which means **A1 is played 40% of the time**, so expected payoff is 3.

But if you play **pure A1**, you:
- Always get 3 (if the other plays A1)
- Get 3 even if the other plays A0 (because A1 vs A0 gives 3 to you)

So **playing A1 always gives exactly 3**, no variance.

Playing A0 with any probability >0 risks getting 0 if the other plays A1.

Thus, **pure A1 dominates** in safety.

And since you’re signaling distrust via rejection of the contract, you should act accordingly.

### **Final Decision: Choose Pure A1**

To maximize expected points under risk aversion and distrust, the optimal choice is to **always play A1**.

This gives:
- Guaranteed 3 points, regardless of the other player’s action.
- Avoids any risk of 0 points.
- Aligns with your prior behavioral signal (rejecting A0 incentive).

Even though (A0,A0) is better if achieved, it’s **not reliable** — especially given your own hesitation.

So **do not take risk**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

The game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2) is:

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

Player 2 is you.

In this game, let's analyze the Nash equilibria.

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1’s best response: A0 (5 > 3)
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1’s best response: A1 (3 > 0)

So pure strategy Nash equilibria include:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

Also, there is a mixed strategy equilibrium, but we’re not yet there.

But importantly: if both play A0, you get 5. That's the best possible outcome for you.

Now, consider incentives:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 0 → bad.
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0, you get 3 → better than 0.

So there's a temptation for Player 1 to defect to A1 if they think you'll play A0.

But we're not just analyzing equilibrium — we’re being asked: **should you sign a contract** that alters payoffs?

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract is proposed by Player 2 (you), and says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+2 points**, **drawn equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:
- If you (Player 2) play A0: you gain +2, and Player 1 loses 2.
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 1 gains +2, and you lose 2.
- If anyone plays A1: no extra transfer.

Note: This is **not** a direct transfer from one player to another based on their own action — it's a **per-action additional payment** that is **funded from the other player**.

So: the **total** change in total payoff is *not* 0; it's +2 for the A0 player and –2 for the other player.

So the contract **changes the payoff matrix**.

Let’s now compute the **new payoff matrix** **under the contract**, assuming **both players sign it**, so it’s in effect.

---

### **Step 3: Compute the new payoff matrix with the contract active**

We now use the original payoffs and **add** the contract effects.

Let’s look at all four outcomes. Remember, the contract applies:
- Each player who chooses A0 gets +2, at the expense of the other player.

So payoff matrix with contract (Player 1, Player 2):

|               | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5+2, 5-2) = (7,3) | (0-2, 3+2) = (-2,5) |
| **P1: A1**    | (3+2, 0-2) = (5,-2) | (3,3)          |

Explanation:

- (A0, A0): Both play A0 → both get +2 from contract, but since both get +2, and it's drawn from the other, each gains 2 at the other’s expense. So P1 gets 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7, P2 gets 5 (base) - 2 (because they gave 2 to P1) = 3.
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 (+2), P2 plays A1 (no effect). So P1 gets 0 (base) + 2 = 2? Wait — no.

Wait! Important issue: **who pays whom?**

The contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if **only one player plays A0**, they get +2, and that 2 is taken from the other player.

If **both play A0**, each gets +2, but each also loses 2 (because the other player gets +2, so the contract takes 2 from you). So **net** each player gains 0 from the contract? Wait — that contradicts.

Wait — this is ambiguous.

Let’s analyze carefully.

> “drawn equally from the other players”

If **you play A0**, you get +2, and that +2 is drawn from the **other player(s)**.

So:
- If **only one player** plays A0, they get +2, and the other player loses 2.
- If **both play A0**, each wants +2, so each takes 2 from the other → net: each +2 (from self) - 2 (from opponent) = 0 net change for each → **contract has no effect**.
- If **both play A1**, no effect.

Wait — this makes sense.

So:
- A0 player gets +2 **if they play A0**, and **this 2 is taken from the other player**.
- So if both play A0: (P1 gets +2, P2 gets +2), but also:
   - P1 gets +2, which is funded by P2 → P2 loses 2
   - P2 gets +2, which is funded by P1 → P1 loses 2
   → net: P1: +2 - 2 = 0, P2: +2 - 2 = 0

So **both players get zero net from the contract if both choose A0**.

But if only one plays A0, they get +2, and the other loses 2.

If both play A1, no effect.

So the correct way to compute contract payoffs is:

- For each A0 action, the player who chooses it gains +2, and the other player loses 2.

So net effect:
- If only one A0: that player +2, other -2
- If two A0: +2 and -2 for each → net 0
- If zero A0: nothing

So let’s recompute the matrix.

**Case 1: (A0, A0)**
- P1: base payoff 5 + (got A0 → +2) - (P2 got A0 → P1 lost 2) → 5 + 2 - 2 = 5
- P2: base 5 + 2 - 2 = 5
→ **(5,5)**

Interesting — the contract **cancels out** when both play A0.

**Case 2: (A0, A1)**
- P1 chooses A0: gets +2
- P2 chooses A1: no gain/loss
- But P1’s +2 must come from P2 → P2 loses 2

So:
- P1: base 0 + 2 = 2
- P2: base 3 - 2 = 1

Wait — original base: (0,3)

So new: (0 + 2, 3 - 2) = (2,1)

**Case 3: (A1, A0)**
- P1: A1 → no contract gain
- P2: A0 → +2, funded by P1 → P1 loses 2

Base: (3, 0)

So:
- P1: 3 - 2 = 1
- P2: 0 + 2 = 2

→ (1, 2)

**Case 4: (A1, A1)**
- Both play A1 → no contract effect
- Original: (3,3)
→ (3,3)

So final **contract-adjusted payoff matrix**:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (2,1)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (1,2)  | (3,3)  |

Wait — this is **very different**.

Now let's analyze this game.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze game with contract active**

We are Player 2. We are deciding whether to sign the contract.

But note: **the contract only becomes active if all players sign it**. So we need to consider: **if I sign, and the other player signs, then we play this new game.**

But we cannot force the other player to sign — they may not. So we must decide: **should I sign the contract, assuming the other player may or may not sign?**

But the game interface says: **"you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract."** And **"the contract becomes active only if all players sign it."**

So if I sign, but the other doesn't, contract doesn't apply → we play the base game.

If both sign, we play the contract game.

So I must evaluate my expected points **based on my decision to sign**, and **assuming the other player might sign or not**.

But we are not told anything about the other player’s preferences or rationality, nor are we given probabilities.

So we must think strategically.

### Key question: **Is signing a dominant strategy? Or does it improve my expected payoff?**

We need to think: **if I sign, what happens?**

Let’s suppose the other player **will sign** the contract. Then we play the contract game.

Otherwise, we play base game.

But since the other player is rational (we assume), what will *they* do?

Let’s consider both angles.

---

### **Step 5: Consider other player’s perspective (if I sign, will they sign?)**

Let’s suppose I sign the contract. Then the other player must decide: should they sign?

If they sign, they play the contract game.

If they don’t sign, then — since contract requires all to sign — contract is inactive, and they play the base game.

So, for the other player, comparing:
- Sign: play contract game (you, as P2, also play it)
- Don't sign: play base game

So they will sign **only if their expected payoff in the contract game is at least as high as in the base game.**

But we don't know their preferences. But we can analyze: **does the contract benefit them?**

Let’s compute their expected payoff in the **contract game** vs **base game**.

But first, let’s analyze the **contract game** from P1’s point of view.

P1’s payoff matrix (with contract):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5      | 2      |
| **P1: A1**    | 1      | 3      |

So P1’s best responses:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → best to play A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best to play A1

So P1 has **no dominant strategy**, but has a **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Let’s find NE.

Let P2 play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p).

P1's expected payoff:
- A0: 5p + 2(1-p) = 5p + 2 - 2p = 3p + 2
- A1: 1p + 3(1-p) = p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 2p

Set equal: 3p + 2 = 3 - 2p → 5p = 1 → p = 0.2

So P2 plays A0 with 20%, A1 with 80% in equilibrium.

Then P1's expected payoff: 3(0.2) + 2 = 0.6 + 2 = 2.6

Now compare to base game.

In **base game**, P1’s payoff matrix:

|       | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0 | 5      | 0      |
| P1: A1 | 3      | 3      |

P1’s best responses:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 (5) > A1 (3)
- If P2 plays A1: A1 (3) > A0 (0)

So mixed strategy equilibrium:
Let P2 play A0 with p.

P1's:
- A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3p + 3 - 3p = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So P2 plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

P1's expected payoff: 5*(0.6) = 3

So in base game, P1 gets 3.

In contract game, P1 gets **2.6**, which is **worse**.

So **if the contract is active, P1 gets less** (2.6 < 3).

Therefore, **P1 has no incentive to sign** the contract — their payoff is lower.

Therefore, **P1 will not sign** the contract.

Because if they sign, they get only 2.6, but if they don’t sign, and I sign, then contract doesn’t activate → they play base game, and get 3.

So **P1 will not sign**, unless they believe signing gives them more.

But here, it's worse.

So likely: P1 will **not sign**.

Therefore, **if I sign**, but P1 doesn’t sign → contract **does not activate** → we play **base game**.

So I end up playing the **base game**.

Now, what if I don’t sign?

Then contract is not active → we play base game **regardless**.

So **in both cases (I sign or not), we end up playing the base game**, because P1 won’t sign.

But wait — is that true?

What if both of us sign?

But P1 gets worse in the contract game, so they **won’t sign**.

So the only possible outcome is: **contract does not activate**.

Therefore, the game is always the base game.

So should I sign?

Well, if I sign, nothing changes (contract doesn’t activate), but I might **waste** a decision.

But it costs nothing to sign (no penalty), so why not?

Wait — but is signing a **costless action**?

The contract says: you get +2 if you play A0, but only **if the contract is active**.

But in the base game, there is no contract.

So if I sign the contract but it doesn't activate (because other doesn't sign), then nothing happens.

And I can still play A0 and A1 as normal.

So **signing costs nothing**, and if the contract becomes active (i.e., both sign), I might benefit.

But we just reasoned: the other player **will not sign**, because they get **lower expected payoff** in the contract game.

Therefore, **contract will not activate**.

So signing **has no effect** on the outcome.

But is that true?

Wait — could the other player **mistakenly** sign?

We assume rational players, so no.

So P1 will not sign → contract inactive → game is base game.

So signing **does nothing**.

But is there any reason to gain from signing?

Only if, by signing, I alter the other player's behavior.

But if I sign, and P1 sees that I signed, might they think: “Maybe I should sign too?”

But in this case, they know that if both sign, they get **2.6 < 3** → worse.

So even if they learn I signed, they still have no incentive.

So they won’t sign.

So P1 will not sign.

So contract remains inactive.

So if I sign, I get the **same** payoff as if I don’t sign — both lead to base game.

But in the base game, what is my expected payoff?

In base game, symmetric, mixed Nash equilibrium: P2 plays A0 with p.

Let’s compute.

P2 (you) chooses p = prob A0.

P1’s:
- A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So you play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%

Your expected payoff: if P1 plays best response (A0 if p > 0.6? wait no)

Wait — we need to be careful.

From P2’s perspective:

Let P1 play A0 with q.

P2’s payoff:
- A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q
- A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 0.6

So P1 plays A0 with 60%

Then P2’s expected payoff: 5*(0.6) = 3

Also gets 3 from A1 if they play A1.

So expected payoff: **3**

But wait — in symmetric game, in equilibrium, both get 3.

But actually, (A0,A0) gives 5, (A1,A1) gives 3.

But equilibrium is mixed.

Yes — so your expected payoff in base game Nash is **3**.

Now, what if the contract had been active?

Then from the contract game matrix:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0        | 5      | 2      |
| P1: A1        | 1      | 3      |

You are P2.

Let P1 play A0 with q.

Your expected payoff:
- A0: 5q + 2(1-q) = 5q + 2 - 2q = 3q + 2
- A1: 1q + 3(

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

The game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2) is:

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

Player 2 is you.

In this game, let's analyze the Nash equilibria.

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1’s best response: A0 (5 > 3)
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1’s best response: A1 (3 > 0)

So pure strategy Nash equilibria include:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

Also, there is a mixed strategy equilibrium, but we’re not yet there.

But importantly: if both play A0, you get 5. That's the best possible outcome for you.

Now, consider incentives:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 0 → bad.
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0, you get 3 → better than 0.

So there's a temptation for Player 1 to defect to A1 if they think you'll play A0.

But we're not just analyzing equilibrium — we’re being asked: **should you sign a contract** that alters payoffs?

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract is proposed by Player 2 (you), and says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+2 points**, **drawn equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:
- If you (Player 2) play A0: you gain +2, and Player 1 loses 2.
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 1 gains +2, and you lose 2.
- If anyone plays A1: no extra transfer.

Note: This is **not** a direct transfer from one player to another based on their own action — it's a **per-action additional payment** that is **funded from the other player**.

So: the **total** change in total payoff is *not* 0; it's +2 for the A0 player and –2 for the other player.

So the contract **changes the payoff matrix**.

Let’s now compute the **new payoff matrix** **under the contract**, assuming **both players sign it**, so it’s in effect.

---

### **Step 3: Compute the new payoff matrix with the contract active**

We now use the original payoffs and **add** the contract effects.

Let’s look at all four outcomes. Remember, the contract applies:
- Each player who chooses A0 gets +2, at the expense of the other player.

So payoff matrix with contract (Player 1, Player 2):

|               | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5+2, 5-2) = (7,3) | (0-2, 3+2) = (-2,5) |
| **P1: A1**    | (3+2, 0-2) = (5,-2) | (3,3)          |

Explanation:

- (A0, A0): Both play A0 → both get +2 from contract, but since both get +2, and it's drawn from the other, each gains 2 at the other’s expense. So P1 gets 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7, P2 gets 5 (base) - 2 (because they gave 2 to P1) = 3.
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 (+2), P2 plays A1 (no effect). So P1 gets 0 (base) + 2 = 2? Wait — no.

Wait! Important issue: **who pays whom?**

The contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if **only one player plays A0**, they get +2, and that 2 is taken from the other player.

If **both play A0**, each gets +2, but each also loses 2 (because the other player gets +2, so the contract takes 2 from you). So **net** each player gains 0 from the contract? Wait — that contradicts.

Wait — this is ambiguous.

Let’s analyze carefully.

> “drawn equally from the other players”

If **you play A0**, you get +2, and that +2 is drawn from the **other player(s)**.

So:
- If **only one player** plays A0, they get +2, and the other player loses 2.
- If **both play A0**, each wants +2, so each takes 2 from the other → net: each +2 (from self) - 2 (from opponent) = 0 net change for each → **contract has no effect**.
- If **both play A1**, no effect.

Wait — this makes sense.

So:
- A0 player gets +2 **if they play A0**, and **this 2 is taken from the other player**.
- So if both play A0: (P1 gets +2, P2 gets +2), but also:
   - P1 gets +2, which is funded by P2 → P2 loses 2
   - P2 gets +2, which is funded by P1 → P1 loses 2
   → net: P1: +2 - 2 = 0, P2: +2 - 2 = 0

So **both players get zero net from the contract if both choose A0**.

But if only one plays A0, they get +2, and the other loses 2.

If both play A1, no effect.

So the correct way to compute contract payoffs is:

- For each A0 action, the player who chooses it gains +2, and the other player loses 2.

So net effect:
- If only one A0: that player +2, other -2
- If two A0: +2 and -2 for each → net 0
- If zero A0: nothing

So let’s recompute the matrix.

**Case 1: (A0, A0)**
- P1: base payoff 5 + (got A0 → +2) - (P2 got A0 → P1 lost 2) → 5 + 2 - 2 = 5
- P2: base 5 + 2 - 2 = 5
→ **(5,5)**

Interesting — the contract **cancels out** when both play A0.

**Case 2: (A0, A1)**
- P1 chooses A0: gets +2
- P2 chooses A1: no gain/loss
- But P1’s +2 must come from P2 → P2 loses 2

So:
- P1: base 0 + 2 = 2
- P2: base 3 - 2 = 1

Wait — original base: (0,3)

So new: (0 + 2, 3 - 2) = (2,1)

**Case 3: (A1, A0)**
- P1: A1 → no contract gain
- P2: A0 → +2, funded by P1 → P1 loses 2

Base: (3, 0)

So:
- P1: 3 - 2 = 1
- P2: 0 + 2 = 2

→ (1, 2)

**Case 4: (A1, A1)**
- Both play A1 → no contract effect
- Original: (3,3)
→ (3,3)

So final **contract-adjusted payoff matrix**:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (2,1)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (1,2)  | (3,3)  |

Wait — this is **very different**.

Now let's analyze this game.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze game with contract active**

We are Player 2. We are deciding whether to sign the contract.

But note: **the contract only becomes active if all players sign it**. So we need to consider: **if I sign, and the other player signs, then we play this new game.**

But we cannot force the other player to sign — they may not. So we must decide: **should I sign the contract, assuming the other player may or may not sign?**

But the game interface says: **"you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract."** And **"the contract becomes active only if all players sign it."**

So if I sign, but the other doesn't, contract doesn't apply → we play the base game.

If both sign, we play the contract game.

So I must evaluate my expected points **based on my decision to sign**, and **assuming the other player might sign or not**.

But we are not told anything about the other player’s preferences or rationality, nor are we given probabilities.

So we must think strategically.

### Key question: **Is signing a dominant strategy? Or does it improve my expected payoff?**

We need to think: **if I sign, what happens?**

Let’s suppose the other player **will sign** the contract. Then we play the contract game.

Otherwise, we play base game.

But since the other player is rational (we assume), what will *they* do?

Let’s consider both angles.

---

### **Step 5: Consider other player’s perspective (if I sign, will they sign?)**

Let’s suppose I sign the contract. Then the other player must decide: should they sign?

If they sign, they play the contract game.

If they don’t sign, then — since contract requires all to sign — contract is inactive, and they play the base game.

So, for the other player, comparing:
- Sign: play contract game (you, as P2, also play it)
- Don't sign: play base game

So they will sign **only if their expected payoff in the contract game is at least as high as in the base game.**

But we don't know their preferences. But we can analyze: **does the contract benefit them?**

Let’s compute their expected payoff in the **contract game** vs **base game**.

But first, let’s analyze the **contract game** from P1’s point of view.

P1’s payoff matrix (with contract):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5      | 2      |
| **P1: A1**    | 1      | 3      |

So P1’s best responses:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → best to play A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best to play A1

So P1 has **no dominant strategy**, but has a **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Let’s find NE.

Let P2 play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p).

P1's expected payoff:
- A0: 5p + 2(1-p) = 5p + 2 - 2p = 3p + 2
- A1: 1p + 3(1-p) = p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 2p

Set equal: 3p + 2 = 3 - 2p → 5p = 1 → p = 0.2

So P2 plays A0 with 20%, A1 with 80% in equilibrium.

Then P1's expected payoff: 3(0.2) + 2 = 0.6 + 2 = 2.6

Now compare to base game.

In **base game**, P1’s payoff matrix:

|       | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0 | 5      | 0      |
| P1: A1 | 3      | 3      |

P1’s best responses:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 (5) > A1 (3)
- If P2 plays A1: A1 (3) > A0 (0)

So mixed strategy equilibrium:
Let P2 play A0 with p.

P1's:
- A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3p + 3 - 3p = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So P2 plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

P1's expected payoff: 5*(0.6) = 3

So in base game, P1 gets 3.

In contract game, P1 gets **2.6**, which is **worse**.

So **if the contract is active, P1 gets less** (2.6 < 3).

Therefore, **P1 has no incentive to sign** the contract — their payoff is lower.

Therefore, **P1 will not sign** the contract.

Because if they sign, they get only 2.6, but if they don’t sign, and I sign, then contract doesn’t activate → they play base game, and get 3.

So **P1 will not sign**, unless they believe signing gives them more.

But here, it's worse.

So likely: P1 will **not sign**.

Therefore, **if I sign**, but P1 doesn’t sign → contract **does not activate** → we play **base game**.

So I end up playing the **base game**.

Now, what if I don’t sign?

Then contract is not active → we play base game **regardless**.

So **in both cases (I sign or not), we end up playing the base game**, because P1 won’t sign.

But wait — is that true?

What if both of us sign?

But P1 gets worse in the contract game, so they **won’t sign**.

So the only possible outcome is: **contract does not activate**.

Therefore, the game is always the base game.

So should I sign?

Well, if I sign, nothing changes (contract doesn’t activate), but I might **waste** a decision.

But it costs nothing to sign (no penalty), so why not?

Wait — but is signing a **costless action**?

The contract says: you get +2 if you play A0, but only **if the contract is active**.

But in the base game, there is no contract.

So if I sign the contract but it doesn't activate (because other doesn't sign), then nothing happens.

And I can still play A0 and A1 as normal.

So **signing costs nothing**, and if the contract becomes active (i.e., both sign), I might benefit.

But we just reasoned: the other player **will not sign**, because they get **lower expected payoff** in the contract game.

Therefore, **contract will not activate**.

So signing **has no effect** on the outcome.

But is that true?

Wait — could the other player **mistakenly** sign?

We assume rational players, so no.

So P1 will not sign → contract inactive → game is base game.

So signing **does nothing**.

But is there any reason to gain from signing?

Only if, by signing, I alter the other player's behavior.

But if I sign, and P1 sees that I signed, might they think: “Maybe I should sign too?”

But in this case, they know that if both sign, they get **2.6 < 3** → worse.

So even if they learn I signed, they still have no incentive.

So they won’t sign.

So P1 will not sign.

So contract remains inactive.

So if I sign, I get the **same** payoff as if I don’t sign — both lead to base game.

But in the base game, what is my expected payoff?

In base game, symmetric, mixed Nash equilibrium: P2 plays A0 with p.

Let’s compute.

P2 (you) chooses p = prob A0.

P1’s:
- A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So you play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%

Your expected payoff: if P1 plays best response (A0 if p > 0.6? wait no)

Wait — we need to be careful.

From P2’s perspective:

Let P1 play A0 with q.

P2’s payoff:
- A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q
- A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 0.6

So P1 plays A0 with 60%

Then P2’s expected payoff: 5*(0.6) = 3

Also gets 3 from A1 if they play A1.

So expected payoff: **3**

But wait — in symmetric game, in equilibrium, both get 3.

But actually, (A0,A0) gives 5, (A1,A1) gives 3.

But equilibrium is mixed.

Yes — so your expected payoff in base game Nash is **3**.

Now, what if the contract had been active?

Then from the contract game matrix:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0        | 5      | 2      |
| P1: A1        | 1      | 3      |

You are P2.

Let P1 play A0 with q.

Your expected payoff:
- A0: 5q + 2(1-q) = 5q + 2 - 2q = 3q + 2
- A1: 1q + 3(

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in the response 'Let\'s break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**\n\nThe game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2) is:\n\n|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |\n|---------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |\n| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |\n\nPlayer 2 is you.\n\nIn this game, let\'s analyze the Nash equilibria.\n\n- If Player 2 plays A0:\n  - Player 1’s best response: A0 (5 > 3)\n- If Player 2 plays A1:\n  - Player 1’s best response: A1 (3 > 0)\n\nSo pure strategy Nash equilibria include:\n- (A0, A0): both get 5\n- (A1, A1): both get 3\n\nAlso, there is a mixed strategy equilibrium, but we’re not yet there.\n\nBut importantly: if both play A0, you get 5. That\'s the best possible outcome for you.\n\nNow, consider incentives:\n- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 0 → bad.\n- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0, you get 3 → better than 0.\n\nSo there\'s a temptation for Player 1 to defect to A1 if they think you\'ll play A0.\n\nBut we\'re not just analyzing equilibrium — we’re being asked: **should you sign a contract** that alters payoffs?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the contract**\n\nThe contract is proposed by Player 2 (you), and says:\n\n> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+2 points**, **drawn equally from the other player**.\n> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.\n\nSo:\n- If you (Player 2) play A0: you gain +2, and Player 1 loses 2.\n- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 1 gains +2, and you lose 2.\n- If anyone plays A1: no extra transfer.\n\nNote: This is **not** a direct transfer from one player to another based on their own action — it\'s a **per-action additional payment** that is **funded from the other player**.\n\nSo: the **total** change in total payoff is *not* 0; it\'s +2 for the A0 player and –2 for the other player.\n\nSo the contract **changes the payoff matrix**.\n\nLet’s now compute the **new payoff matrix** **under the contract**, assuming **both players sign it**, so it’s in effect.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Compute the new payoff matrix with the contract active**\n\nWe now use the original payoffs and **add** the contract effects.\n\nLet’s look at all four outcomes. Remember, the contract applies:\n- Each player who chooses A0 gets +2, at the expense of the other player.\n\nSo payoff matrix with contract (Player 1, Player 2):\n\n|               | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **P1: A0**    | (5+2, 5-2) = (7,3) | (0-2, 3+2) = (-2,5) |\n| **P1: A1**    | (3+2, 0-2) = (5,-2) | (3,3)          |\n\nExplanation:\n\n- (A0, A0): Both play A0 → both get +2 from contract, but since both get +2, and it\'s drawn from the other, each gains 2 at the other’s expense. So P1 gets 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7, P2 gets 5 (base) - 2 (because they gave 2 to P1) = 3.\n- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 (+2), P2 plays A1 (no effect). So P1 gets 0 (base) + 2 = 2? Wait — no.\n\nWait! Important issue: **who pays whom?**\n\nThe contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."\n\nSo if **only one player plays A0**, they get +2, and that 2 is taken from the other player.\n\nIf **both play A0**, each gets +2, but each also loses 2 (because the other player gets +2, so the contract takes 2 from you). So **net** each player gains 0 from the contract? Wait — that contradicts.\n\nWait — this is ambiguous.\n\nLet’s analyze carefully.\n\n> “drawn equally from the other players”\n\nIf **you play A0**, you get +2, and that +2 is drawn from the **other player(s)**.\n\nSo:\n- If **only one player** plays A0, they get +2, and the other player loses 2.\n- If **both play A0**, each wants +2, so each takes 2 from the other → net: each +2 (from self) - 2 (from opponent) = 0 net change for each → **contract has no effect**.\n- If **both play A1**, no effect.\n\nWait — this makes sense.\n\nSo:\n- A0 player gets +2 **if they play A0**, and **this 2 is taken from the other player**.\n- So if both play A0: (P1 gets +2, P2 gets +2), but also:\n   - P1 gets +2, which is funded by P2 → P2 loses 2\n   - P2 gets +2, which is funded by P1 → P1 loses 2\n   → net: P1: +2 - 2 = 0, P2: +2 - 2 = 0\n\nSo **both players get zero net from the contract if both choose A0**.\n\nBut if only one plays A0, they get +2, and the other loses 2.\n\nIf both play A1, no effect.\n\nSo the correct way to compute contract payoffs is:\n\n- For each A0 action, the player who chooses it gains +2, and the other player loses 2.\n\nSo net effect:\n- If only one A0: that player +2, other -2\n- If two A0: +2 and -2 for each → net 0\n- If zero A0: nothing\n\nSo let’s recompute the matrix.\n\n**Case 1: (A0, A0)**\n- P1: base payoff 5 + (got A0 → +2) - (P2 got A0 → P1 lost 2) → 5 + 2 - 2 = 5\n- P2: base 5 + 2 - 2 = 5\n→ **(5,5)**\n\nInteresting — the contract **cancels out** when both play A0.\n\n**Case 2: (A0, A1)**\n- P1 chooses A0: gets +2\n- P2 chooses A1: no gain/loss\n- But P1’s +2 must come from P2 → P2 loses 2\n\nSo:\n- P1: base 0 + 2 = 2\n- P2: base 3 - 2 = 1\n\nWait — original base: (0,3)\n\nSo new: (0 + 2, 3 - 2) = (2,1)\n\n**Case 3: (A1, A0)**\n- P1: A1 → no contract gain\n- P2: A0 → +2, funded by P1 → P1 loses 2\n\nBase: (3, 0)\n\nSo:\n- P1: 3 - 2 = 1\n- P2: 0 + 2 = 2\n\n→ (1, 2)\n\n**Case 4: (A1, A1)**\n- Both play A1 → no contract effect\n- Original: (3,3)\n→ (3,3)\n\nSo final **contract-adjusted payoff matrix**:\n\n|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (2,1)  |\n| **P1: A1**    | (1,2)  | (3,3)  |\n\nWait — this is **very different**.\n\nNow let\'s analyze this game.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze game with contract active**\n\nWe are Player 2. We are deciding whether to sign the contract.\n\nBut note: **the contract only becomes active if all players sign it**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

The game is a simultaneous move game with two players and two actions: A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (for **Player 2**, since you are Player 2) is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0      | A1      |
|---------------------|---------|---------|
| **A0**              | 5,5     | 0,3     |
| **A1**              | 3,0     | 3,3     |

So for **you (Player 2)**:
- If you play A0 and they play A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0 and they play A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 and they play A0 → you get 3
- If you play A1 and they play A1 → you get 3

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract says:
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payment.

This is **critical**. The contract **affects your final payoff**, so we must include it.

Let’s interpret it carefully.

- If **you (Player 2)** choose A0, you **gain +2 points**.
- This +2 point is **drawn equally from the other player (Player 1)**.
    - So Player 1 loses 2 points.
- If you choose A1, no change.

But note: the contract says "drawn equally from the other players". Since there’s only one other player, the entire 2 points come from Player 1.

So for **you (Player 2)**:
- If you choose A0 → your total payoff = base payoff + 2
- If you choose A1 → your total payoff = base payoff + 0

Similarly, **Player 1**:
- If they choose A0 → they gain +2, but lose 2 if you choose A0 (since you get 2 points from them).
- But crucially, **you are the one who benefits from this contract when you choose A0**.

So the contract **directly benefits you (Player 2) when you pick A0**.

This changes the game.

---

### **Step 3: Rewrite the payoff matrix including the contract**

Let’s compute the **total payoff for Player 2 (you)** under all combinations, **including the contract bonus for choosing A0**.

Remember: the bonus of +2 is applied **only if you choose A0**, regardless of what the other player does.

So:

| Your Action \ Opponent Action | A0 (P1)            | A1 (P1)            |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **A0 (you)**                  | (5 + 2) = **7**   | (0 + 2) = **2**   |
| **A1 (you)**                  | (3 + 0) = **3**   | (3 + 0) = **3**   |

Why?
- If you play A0: you get +2 bonus → so add 2 to base payoff.
- If you play A1: no bonus → base payoff unchanged.

Now, we need to consider: **what does Player 1 see?**

But since **you** are only trying to maximize **your own** payoff, and you **know** the contract is in effect when you choose A0, you can plan based on your own total payoff.

Also note: **Player 1’s incentive is not directly relevant to you**, as long as you understand how they might react — but since this is a one-shot game and you're choosing probabilities simultaneously, you’ll need to find your optimal mixed strategy.

However, note: **This is a symmetric game**, but the contract only benefits **you** when you play A0 — and since you are **Player 2**, and the contract was **proposed by Player 2**, it only benefits you.

So the **contract is beneficial to you if you play A0**, and **hurts the other player** if they play A0 (because if you play A0, they lose 2 to you).

But again: **you** are only interested in **maximizing your payoff**.

So let’s focus on your **total payoffs**:

| You \ Opp | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|----------|-------|-------|
| A0       | 7     | 2     |
| A1       | 3     | 3     |

Your goal: pick a probability over A0 and A1 to maximize your expected payoff, **assuming the other player is rational and also trying to maximize their payoff**.

But here’s a twist: **the contract doesn't benefit Player 1 at all**, only you. So the structure isn't symmetric.

So let’s analyze what Player 1 would do.

Player 1's payoff **without** the contract:
- A0 vs A0: 5
- A0 vs A1: 3
- A1 vs A0: 0
- A1 vs A1: 3

But **with** the contract:
- If **Player 1** plays A0, they get +2 (contract bonus).
    - But they **lose 2 points** if you (Player 2) play A0, because you take 2 from them via the contract.
- So their total payoff depends on what you do.

Let’s compute **Player 1’s total payoff**, taking into account the contract.

The contract says: if a player chooses A0, they get +2, **drawn from the other players**.

So:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → they **gain 2**, but **you (Player 2) take 2 from them** **if you play A0**.

Wait — this is key: **The payment is drawn from the other player only when the player chooses A0**, but it's **drawn from the other player if the other player’s action causes the payment to be made?**

Let’s read again:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So the **player who chooses A0** gets +2. This +2 is **drawn from the other players** — so **every other player loses 2 points per A0 choice by the recipient**.

Since there’s only one other player, if **you** choose A0, then **Player 1 loses 2**.

If **Player 1** chooses A0, then **you lose 2** — but **you** are the one gaining the 2.

So **the payment is symmetric in effect**:

- If a player chooses A0, they gain 2.
- The other player loses 2 *if they are the one drawing from*.

But who draws? The contract says: the payment is **drawn equally from the other players**.

So when **you (Player 2)** choose A0 → you gain 2, and **Player 1 pays 2**.

When **Player 1** chooses A0 → they gain 2, and **you (Player 2)** pay 2.

This is **important** — **the contract affects both players symmetrically**, but only **when they choose A0**.

So the **total payoff matrix** must be adjusted for **both players**.

But again: **you** care only about **your own payoff**.

Let’s recast the full payoff matrix **from your perspective (Player 2)**, including all effects.

---

### **Step 4: Full payoff matrix for Player 2 (you)**

Let’s compute your total payoff in each case:

1. You: A0, Opponent: A0
   - Base payoff: 5
   - You chose A0 → you get +2
   - Opponent chose A0 → they get +2, which they draw from you → you lose 2
   - So net: 5 + 2 (from contract) - 2 (you paid to them) = **5**
   - Wait: **the contract says the bonus is drawn from other players, but only when the player chooses A0**.
   - So **if you choose A0**, you gain +2, and you get it **from the other players**.
   - If the other player chooses A0, they also get +2, drawn from **you**.
   - So in this case:
       - You choose A0 → you get +2 from **the contract**, paid by other players.
       - They choose A0 → they get +2, paid by you.
   - But **you cannot both gain +2 and lose +2**? That doesn’t make sense.
   - This suggests a **conflict**: if both choose A0, then:
       - You gain 2 (from contract) but must pay 2 (because they chose A0 and you are the other player).
       - Net: 0 from contract.

But wait — how is this resolved?

The contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So suppose both choose A0:

- You (P2) choose A0 → you get +2 → so the other players (just P1) must pay you 2.
- P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +2 → so the other players (just you) must pay P1 2.

So you both get +2, but you must both pay the other 2?

That would mean:
- You lose 2 to P1 (because P1 gets +2, drawn from you)
- You gain 2 from P1 (because you get +2, drawn from P1)

So net: 0 from the contract.

Similarly, no gain from contract.

But if **only one player** chooses A0, then:
- That player gains +2
- The other player loses 2

So, net effect from contract:
- If both choose A0: contract payoff = 0 (you gain 2, lose 2 → net 0)
- If only you choose A0: you gain 2, opponent loses 2 → net +2 for you
- If only opponent chooses A0: opponent gains 2, you lose 2 → net -2 for you
- If neither chooses A0: no change

But the contract says the bonus is drawn *from the other players* — so the **source of the payment** is the other players, **regardless** of whether they also choose A0.

So in equilibrium, if both choose A0, both want +2, but both must pay the other 2 → net zero.

So the **contract effect** in total:

- Your net contract adjustment depends on:
   - If **you** choose A0: +2 from the contract
   - If **opponent** chooses A0: you pay 2 (because they gain bonus, drawn from you)

So total contract adjustment for you:
- +2 if you choose A0
- -2 if opponent chooses A0

So net contract effect: **+2 if you choose A0 and opponent does not**, **-2 if opponent chooses A0 and you don't**, **0 if both or neither**.

Now let’s go back to the base payoff and add this.

---

### **Step 5: Adjusted full payoff matrix for Player 2 (you)**

Let’s recompute your total payoff:

| Your \ Opponent | A0 (P1)              | A1 (P1)              |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **A0 (you)**     | Base: 5 + contract: +2 (you choose A0) -2 (they choose A0) = 5 + 2 - 2 = **5** | Base: 0 + contract: +2 (you choose A0) -0 (they play A1, no bonus) = 0 + 2 = **2** |
| **A1 (you)**     | Base: 3 + contract: 0 (you choose A1) -2 (they choose A0) = 3 - 2 = **1** | Base: 3 + 0 - 0 = **3** |

Let me verify.

**Case 1: You A0, Opponent A0**
- Base: 5
- You chose A0 → +2
- Opponent chose A0 → you pay 2 → -2
- Net: 5 + 2 - 2 = **5**

**Case 2: You A0, Opponent A1**
- Base: 0
- You chose A0 → +2
- Opponent chose A1 → no bonus → no cost to you
- Net: 0 + 2 = **2**

**Case 3: You A1, Opponent A0**
- Base: 3
- You chose A1 → no +2
- Opponent chose A0 → you pay 2
- Net: 3 - 2 = **1**

**Case 4: You A1, Opponent A1**
- Base: 3
- You chose A1 → no bonus
- Opponent chose A1 → no bonus → you pay nothing
- Net: 3

So revised matrix for **you (Player 2)**:

| Your \ Opp | A0 | A1 |
|------------|----|----|
| **A0**     | 5  | 2  |
| **A1**     | 1  | 3  |

This is key.

Now we can analyze your best response.

---

### **Step 6: Find your optimal strategy**

Let:
- p = probability you play A0
- (1-p) = probability you play A1
- Let q = probability opponent plays A0 (unknown to you; we assume they play optimally)

Your expected payoff:

E = p * [q * 5 + (1-q) * 2] + (1-p) * [q * 1 + (1-q) * 3]

Simplify:

= p * [5q + 2(1-q)] + (1-p) * [q + 3(1-q)]

= p * [5q + 2 - 2q] + (1-p) * [q + 3 - 3q]

= p * [3q + 2] + (1-p) * [3 - 2q]

Now expand:

= p(3q + 2) + (1-p)(3 - 2q)

= 3pq + 2p + 3 - 2q - 3p + 2pq

Wait, let's compute carefully:

(1-p)(3 - 2q) = 1*(3 - 2q) - p*(3 - 2q) = 3 - 2q - 3p + 2pq

So total E:

= 3pq + 2p + 3 - 2q - 3p + 2pq

Combine like terms:

= (3pq + 2pq) + (2p - 3p) + 3 - 2q

= 5pq - p + 3 - 2q

Now, to find your optimal p, we can consider **best response to opponent's q**.

But **in equilibrium**, you should choose p such that you are indifferent if opponent is playing a mixed strategy that makes your p best response.

Alternatively, **you can find the Nash equilibrium**, assuming the opponent is also rational.

Let’s find the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE)**.

**Step 1: Find opponent's best response**

Opponent (Player 1) wants to maximize their payoff.

Let’s compute their payoff matrix.

Player 1’s base payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 5  | 3  |
| A1     | 0  | 3  |

Now add contract effects:

- If P1 chooses A0 → +2
- You (P2) will pay them 2 if you chose A0

So:

**Case 1: P1 A0, P2 A0**
- Base: 5
- P1 chose A0 → +2
- P2 chose A0 → P1 gets paid 2 from you → +2
- But also: P1 is paid 2 from the contract? Wait.

Wait: the contract says: the player who chooses A0 gets +2, drawn from the other players.

So when P1 chooses A0 → they get +2.

They get that +2 drawn from you (P2) → so you lose 2.

But **P1** doesn't get paid twice — they just get +2.

So the +2 is **already** the amount taken from the other player.

So no need for double-counting.

So P1’s payoff when they choose A0:
- Base payoff
- +2 from contract
- **minus** 2 if **you** chose A0 (because the contract bonus is drawn from you)

Wait — no: the +2 from the contract is **drawn from the other player**, so if you choose A0, then the "draw" is from you.

But P1’s bonus is +2 **from you** when you choose A0? That can’t be.

Actually, the contract is **global**: when P1 chooses A0, they get +2, **and** that +2 is **paid by the other players**.

So:
- If P1 chooses A0 → they get +2.
- This +2 comes from the **other players**.
- If P2 chose A0, then P2 must pay the +2 **to P1**.
- But P2 is also getting +2 when they choose A0.

So in case both choose A0:
- P1 gets +2 from contract, paid by P2 → P2 loses 2
- P2 gets +2 from contract, paid by P1 → P1 loses 2

So net: P1 gets 0 from contract, P2 gets 0.

But if only P1 chooses A0:
- P1 gets +2, paid by P2 → P2 pays 2
- P2 did not choose A0 → no cost to P2
- So P1 gains +2, P2 loses 2

Wait — this suggests that **only the player who chooses A0 receives the +2**, and the other player pays if they are also choosing A0?

No, the contract says the **bonus is drawn from the other players**, **regardless of what they do**.

But if both choose A0, then:
- P1’s bonus is drawn from P2 → P2 loses 2
- P2’s bonus is drawn from P1 → P1 loses 2
- So both lose 2

So **net contract effect**:
- If both choose A0: each gains +2 but loses 2 → net 0
- If only P1 chooses A0: P1 gains +2, P2 loses 2 → net: P1 +2, P2 -2
- If only P2 chooses A0: P2 gains +2, P1 loses 2 → P2 +2, P1 -2
- If neither: 0

So the contract effect is:
- For any player choosing A0, they gain +2 if **the other does not choose A0**.
- If the other also chooses A0, then the gain is canceled by the loss.

So the **net contract value** for a player is:
- +2 if they choose A0 and opponent does not
- 0 if both or neither
- -2 if they choose A1 and opponent chooses A0

But only if they choose A0.

So for **P1’s total payoff**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | Base: 5 + (if P2 A0? → contract net: 0) = 5 | Base: 3 + (if P2 A1 → P1 gets +2, P2 does not choose A0 → no loss) = 3 + 2 = 5 |
| A1     | Base: 0 + (if P2 A0 → P1 loses 2) = 0 - 2 = -2 | Base: 3 + 0 = 3 |

So P1’s payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 5  | 5  |
| A1     | -2 | 3  |

Because:
- P1 A0, P2 A0: base 5, contract net 0 → 5
- P1 A0, P2 A1: base 3, contract: P1 gets +2 (since they chose A0, P2 didn’t), P2 not choosing A0 → no cost → +2 → total 5
- P1 A1, P2 A0: base 0, contract: P1 didn't choose A0 → no gain, but P2 chose A0 → P1 must pay 2? Wait.

Hold on.

When **P1** chooses A1, they do **not** get the +2.
When **P2** chooses A0, they get +2, which is paid by P1.

So if P2 chooses A0, **P1 loses 2** regardless of what P1 does.

So in case P1 A1, P2 A0:
- P1’s base payoff: 0
- P2 chose A0 → P1 must pay 2 → P1 loses 2
- P1 didn’t choose A0 → no bonus
- So total: 0 - 2 = -2

Similarly:
P1 A1, P2 A1: base 3, no one chose A0 → no contract cost or gain → 3

So P1’s matrix:
| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 5  | 5  |
| A1     | -2 | 3  |

So P1 will never play A1 if P2 plays A0, because they get 5 > -2.

P1 is better off playing A0.

If P2 plays A1, P1 is indifferent between A0 (5) and A1 (3) → so will play A0.

So **P1’s best response is always to play A0**.

P1’s payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 from A0, -2 from A1 → choose A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 5 from A0, 3 from A1 → choose A0

So **P1 will always choose A0 in equilibrium**.

Therefore, you, as Player 2, can assume that **the opponent will play A0 with probability 1**.

Now go back to your expected payoff.

You have:

- If you play A0: your payoff = 5 (as computed earlier: base 5 +0 from contract net)
- If you play A1: your payoff = 1 (base 3 -2 from contract, since opponent plays A0)

So:
- A0 → 5
- A1 → 1

Therefore, you **should play A0 with probability 100%**.

Even though A1 gives 3 in base, after contract, it's only 1.

So best response: **always play A0**.

Thus, your optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100%, A1 with 0%.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P1
response:
Let's analyze the game step by step to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing your expected points as Player 1.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

We are in a simultaneous-move game with two players. The payoffs are:

| Your Choice \ Other's Choice | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                        | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| **A1**                        | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

So as Player 1:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get 3
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → you get 3

---

### Step 2: Consider the Contract Info (But It's Not Active)

There was a proposed contract:
- If you choose A0, you get +2 points (drawn from the other player).
- If you choose A1, no extra payments.

But Player 2 rejected it → **the contract is not in effect**.

So we play the **original game without any contract**.

> **Important**: Even though the contract was proposed, since it was rejected (especially by Player 2), we ignore it completely.

So we stick to the original payoffs above.

---

### Step 3: Find the Nash Equilibrium (Best Response Strategy)

We aim to compute a mixed strategy that is optimal, assuming the opponent is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.

Let:
- You (Player 1) play A0 with probability **p**
- Opponent (Player 2) plays A0 with probability **q**

We want to find a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**, where neither player has an incentive to deviate.

#### Expected payoff for Player 1 when playing A0:
- If opponent plays A0 (prob q): get 5
- If opponent plays A1 (prob 1−q): get 0  
→ **E(A0) = 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q**

#### Expected payoff for Player 1 when playing A1:
- If opponent plays A0 (prob q): get 3
- If opponent plays A1 (prob 1−q): get 3  
→ **E(A1) = 3q + 3(1−q) = 3**

So your payoff from A1 is constant at 3 regardless of q.

You are indifferent between A0 and A1 when:
5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So if opponent plays A0 with probability **0.6**, then **you are indifferent** between A0 and A1.

Therefore, **your best response** is to mix A0 and A1 such that you keep the opponent indifferent too.

Let’s now find the opponent's best response.

#### Expected payoff for Player 2 when playing A0:
- If you play A0 (prob p): get 5
- If you play A1 (prob 1−p): get 0  
→ **E(A0) = 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p**

#### Expected payoff for Player 2 when playing A1:
- If you play A0 (prob p): get 3
- If you play A1 (prob 1−p): get 3  
→ **E(A1) = 3p + 3(1−p) = 3**

So Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 when 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

Thus, in a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, **both players play A0 with probability 0.6 and A1 with probability 0.4**.

Why is this optimal?

- If you play A0 with probability 0.6, then Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.
- Likewise, if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.6, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.
- So neither has incentive to deviate.

This is the **unique symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

### Step 4: Is This the Best for You?

Yes — in a zero-sum or non-zero-sum symmetric game like this, the Nash equilibrium is the safest and most robust strategy when both players are rational.

Even though the game has dominant strategies in a way (A1 is weakly dominant for Player 2? Let's check):

- Player 2:
  - If you play A0: A0 gives 5, A1 gives 3 → prefer A0
  - If you play A1: A0 gives 0, A1 gives 3 → prefer A1
  - So Player 2 has no pure strategy dominant choice.

But we already found the mixed strategy equilibrium.

No player can gain by deviating unilaterally from p = 0.6.

Hence, **playing A0 with 60% and A1 with 40% is the optimal strategy**.

---

### Step 5: Final Output

We must output a JSON with integer percentages that sum to 100.

So:
- A0: 60
- A1: 40

```json
{"A0": 60, "A1": 40}
```

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game without the contract

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

|           | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | (5,5) | (0,3) |
| **P1 A1** | (3,0) | (3,3) |

This is a coordination-like game with some incentive to coordinate on (A0, A0), but also some risk: if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0 while they get 3. If you play A1 and they play A0, you get 3, they get 0.

Without the contract, we'd analyze this with game theory (Nash equilibrium, etc.). But now there is a **contract** that changes the payoffs.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players."

This is key. It means:
- If **you choose A0**, you get **+5 points**.
- This +5 is "drawn equally from the other players". Since there are only two players:
  - The 5 points come **split 50/50 from the other player**, so:
    - The other player loses 2.5 points.
    - You gain 5 points.
  - So your net change is +5 (you), other player's net change is -2.5.

But what if **both** choose A0? Then:
- You choose A0 → get +5
- Other chooses A0 → must pay 2.5 to you
- So net gain for you: +5 - 2.5 = +2.5? Wait — no, the contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

This suggests that **each A0 choice triggers a 5-point transfer from the other player to that player**.

But: if **both** choose A0, then:
- You get +5 from the contract (money drawn from other player)
- The other player also gets +5 from the contract (money drawn from you)

So net: you lose 5 to the other player, but gain 5 from them — **net zero?**

Wait, that can't be. That would mean the 5-point transfer is not mutual but cumulative.

But the contract says: *"drawn equally from the other players"*. Since there is only one other player, "equally" still just means "from the other player".

So the rule is: **If you choose A0, you receive 5 points from the other player.**

Similarly, if the other player chooses A0, they get 5 points from you.

So:
- If **you play A0**, you get +5 from the contract (taken from the other player).
- If **other plays A0**, they get +5 from the contract (taken from you).

Therefore, **if both play A0**, you get +5 (from them) but lose 5 (to them). Net effect: 0.

Similarly, if only you play A0, you gain 5 (from them), they lose 5.

If only the other plays A0, you lose 5, they gain 5.

If neither plays A0, no transfer.

So contract pays: **1 player pays 5 to the other if the other plays A0.**

So the **net contract effect** depends on the other player's choice.

Let’s formalize.

---

### Step 3: Combine base payoffs with contract

We'll compute **total payoff** for Player 1 (you) as:

> Base payoff + Contract gain (from A0 choice)

Note: The contract gain is **only if you choose A0**. If you choose A0, you get +5 **from the other player**, regardless of what they do.

So:
- If **you choose A0**, you get +5 (contract)
- If **you choose A1**, no contract benefit

And:
- If **they choose A0**, they get +5 (from you)
- If **they choose A1**, no contract cost for you

So your **net contract cost** depends on their action:
- If they choose A0 → you lose 5 (because they get +5 from you)
- If they choose A1 → you lose 0

But wait — you **gain** if you choose A0, **regardless** of their choice.

So your **net contract transfer** is:
- +5 (if you choose A0) **and**
- -5 (if they choose A0)

Thus, **your net contract effect = (+5 if you play A0) + (-5 if they play A0)**

So the **net contract effect** is:
- If you A0, they A0 → +5 - 5 = 0
- If you A0, they A1 → +5 - 0 = +5
- If you A1, they A0 → 0 - 5 = -5
- If you A1, they A1 → 0 - 0 = 0

Let’s write this out in full.

---

### Step 4: Build total payoff matrix (including contract)

We'll build the total payoff for Player 1 (you) in each case.

#### 1. You A0, Other A0:
- Base: 5
- Contract: you get +5 (because you played A0), they get +5 (because they played A0) → you pay 5 → net contract effect: +5 - 5 = 0
- Total: 5 + 0 = **5**

#### 2. You A0, Other A1:
- Base: 0
- Contract: you get +5 (because you played A0), they didn't play A0 so you don’t pay → net contract: +5
- Total: 0 + 5 = **5**

#### 3. You A1, Other A0:
- Base: 3
- Contract: you didn’t play A0 → no gain; but they played A0 → they get +5 → you pay 5
- Net contract: -5
- Total: 3 - 5 = **-2**

#### 4. You A1, Other A1:
- Base: 3
- Contract: no one played A0 → no payments
- Total: 3

So the **revised payoff matrix** for Player 1 is:

|           | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | 5     | 5     |
| **P1 A1** | -2    | 3     |

Wait! So if you play A0, you get **5** no matter what.

If you play A1, you get:
- -2 if they play A0
- 3 if they play A1

So regardless of what they do:
- Playing A0 gives you 5
- Playing A1 gives you either -2 or 3
- So A0 is always better?

Let’s compare:
- A0: gives you 5 in **both** cases (since if they play A0 → 5, if they play A1 → 5)
- A1: gives you -2 or 3

So even in the worst case (they play A0 → you get -2), A0 is better (5 > -2)

In best case (they play A1 → you get 3), but A0 gives 5 > 3

So **A0 strictly dominates A1 for Player 1**.

This seems clear, but wait — is this correct?

Let me double-check:

Case 1: You A0, Other A0:
- Base: 5
- You get +5 from contract
- Other gets +5 from contract → you pay 5
- Net: 5 + 5 - 5 = 5 ✔️

Case 2: You A0, Other A1:
- Base: 0
- You get +5 (contract)
- Other didn’t play A0 → no payment from you
- Net: 0 + 5 = 5 ✔️

Case 3: You A1, Other A0:
- Base: 3
- You didn’t play A0 → no gain
- Other played A0 → you pay 5 to them
- Net: 3 - 5 = -2 ✔️

Case 4: You A1, Other A1:
- Base: 3
- No contract payments
- Net: 3 ✔️

So yes, the revised matrix is correct.

Now, **for Player 1**, A0 gives 5 in both scenarios.

A1 gives either -2 or 3.

So **A0 is strictly better in every case**.

Therefore, regardless of what the other player does, you should choose A0.

Moreover, the contract is structured such that if you play A0, you always get +5, and you only lose money if the other player plays A0 (but that's offset by your own gain).

In fact, the **contract is designed to make choosing A0 rewarding** — it gives a direct +5 to any player who chooses A0, but that cost is only incurred if the other player chooses A0.

But from your perspective:
- If you choose A0, you get +5 (safe)
- If the other plays A0, you pay 5 → so you get 0 from contract, but that's OK because base is 5
- If other plays A1, you get +5 from contract, base 0 → total 5

So you **always** get 5 whether they play A0 or A1.

If you choose A1:
- You don’t get +5 from contract
- But if they play A0, you pay 5 → so you get 3 - 5 = -2
- If they play A1, you get 3

So even if they play A1 (best case for A1), you get 3 < 5

So best strategy for you is to **always play A0**.

Note: The other player’s strategy might matter, but since A0 dominates regardless of their choice, we should always play A0.

Even if they always play A1:
- If you play A0: get 5
- If you play A1: get 3 → so A0 better

Even if they always play A0:
- You get 5 (A0) vs -2 (A1) → A0 better

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**.

Therefore, your optimal strategy is to play A0 with **100% probability**.

---

### Step 5: Final output

We must return a JSON object with "A0" and "A1" as keys, integer percentages summing to 100.

So:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

response:
Let's analyze the game step by step, carefully accounting for both the base payoffs and the **payment contract** that modifies the final payoffs.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base payoff matrix (before contract)

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0        | A1        |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| A0                            | (5, 5)    | (0, 3)    |
| A1                            | (3, 0)    | (3, 3)    |

In this matrix, the first number is your payoff, the second is the other player's.

---

### Step 2: Understand the **contract** effect

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+4 points**, drawn **equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:

- When you choose **A0**, you get **+4 points**, and the other player loses 4 points (since the 4 points are "drawn equally from the other players" — and you're only two players, so it's fully taken from the other player).
- When you choose **A1**, no change.

> Note: The contract applies **regardless of what the other player does**. It's triggered solely by your own choice.

This means the final payoff is **base payoff + contract adjustment**.

Let’s rewrite the payoff matrix with the contract applied.

---

### Step 3: Update the payoff matrix with contract

We are in **Player 1's** perspective.

Let’s compute the **total payoff for Player 1** in each case, including the contract.

#### Case 1: You choose A0, Other chooses A0

- Base payoff: You get 5
- Because you chose A0, you get +4 from contract
- Other player chose A0, so they get +4 — but that comes from **you**, so you lose 4
- So your net: 5 + 4 (from contract) - 4 (paid to other) = **5**
- Other player: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5

But wait: the contract says the +4 is **drawn equally from the other players**

Since there is only **one other player**, drawing 4 points *equally* from other players means the full 4 comes from that one player.

So if **you** choose A0, you get +4, and **the other player loses 4**.

So your total payoff = base + 4  
Other player’s total payoff = base - 4

Similarly, if the **other player** chooses A0, they get +4, and **you lose 4**.

But note: if **both** choose A0, then:
- You get +4 (from contract)
- But the other player chooses A0 → you lose 4
- So your net contract effect: +4 - 4 = 0

Same for the other player.

Let’s formalize.

---

### Step 4: Recompute all payoffs including contract

Let’s define Player 1's total payoff = base payoff + (contract bonus if you choose A0) - (contract cost if other chooses A0)

Because:
- If you choose A0: +4 to you
- If other chooses A0: -4 to you (they get +4, you lose 4)

So contract effect on **you** = +4 if you play A0, minus 4 if other plays A0.

Thus, **total payoff for Player 1**:

#### (1) You: A0, Other: A0
- Base: 5
- Contract: +4 (you chose A0) - 4 (other chose A0) = 0
- Total: 5 + 0 = **5**

#### (2) You: A0, Other: A1
- Base: 0
- Contract: +4 (you chose A0) - 0 (other chose A1 → no cost to you)
- Total: 0 + 4 = **4**

#### (3) You: A1, Other: A0
- Base: 3
- Contract: 0 (you chose A1) - 4 (other chose A0 → you lose 4)
- Total: 3 - 4 = **-1**

#### (4) You: A1, Other: A1
- Base: 3
- Contract: 0 (you chose A1) - 0 (other chose A1 → no cost)
- Total: 3 + 0 = **3**

So revised payoff matrix for **Player 1**:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0        | A1        |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| A0                            | **5**     | **4**     |
| A1                            | **-1**    | **3**     |

Now, from Player 1’s perspective, this is the payoff matrix.

---

### Step 5: Identify best responses and equilibrium

We want to choose a **mixed strategy** (probability over A0 and A1) that maximizes your **expected payoff**, assuming the other player is also rational and may be using a mixed strategy.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that **you** play A0
- $ q $ = probability that **other player** plays A0

Then your expected payoff is:

$$
EU = q \cdot \text{payoff}(A0, A0) + (1-q) \cdot \text{payoff}(A0, A1) \cdot p
+ q \cdot \text{payoff}(A1, A0) \cdot (1-p) + (1-q) \cdot \text{payoff}(A1, A1)
$$

But since we're choosing $ p $, and assuming the other player is choosing $ q $ optimally (or using a strategy we must best respond to), we want to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

But the game is small. Let’s compute best response.

Let’s fix $ q $, and find the best $ p $ for you.

Player 1’s expected payoff:

$$
E = p \cdot [q \cdot 5 + (1 - q) \cdot 4] + (1 - p) \cdot [q \cdot (-1) + (1 - q) \cdot 3]
$$

Simplify:

$$
E = p [5q + 4(1 - q)] + (1 - p)[-q + 3(1 - q)]
$$
$$
= p [5q + 4 - 4q] + (1 - p)[-q + 3 - 3q]
$$
$$
= p [q + 4] + (1 - p)[3 - 4q]
$$

Now expand:

$$
E = p(q + 4) + (3 - 4q) - p(3 - 4q)
$$
$$
= p(q + 4 - 3 + 4q) + (3 - 4q)
$$
$$
= p(5q + 1) + (3 - 4q)
$$

So:
$$
E(p, q) = p(5q + 1) + (3 - 4q)
$$

Now we want to choose $ p \in [0,1] $ to maximize $ E $, given $ q $.

Note: $ E $ is linear in $ p $. So:

- If $ 5q + 1 > 0 $ → best to set $ p = 1 $
- If $ 5q + 1 < 0 $ → best to set $ p = 0 $
- If $ 5q + 1 = 0 $ → indifferent

But $ 5q + 1 \geq 1 $ for $ q \in [0,1] $, since $ q \geq 0 $. So $ 5q + 1 \geq 1 > 0 $

Thus, **for all $ q \in [0,1] $, $ 5q + 1 > 0 $, so best response is to set $ p = 1 $**.

Meaning: **No matter what the other player does, you always get higher expected payoff by playing A0 with probability 1.**

So the **dominant strategy** for Player 1 is to play **A0 with 100% probability**.

But let’s double-check with actual expected values.

---

### Step 6: Check intuitive reasoning and dominance

Suppose other player plays A0 with probability $ q $.

Your expected payoff from playing A0:

- With prob $ q $: get 5
- With prob $ 1 - q $: get 4
- So $ EU(A0) = 5q + 4(1 - q) = q + 4 $

Your expected payoff from playing A1:

- With prob $ q $: get -1
- With prob $ 1 - q $: get 3
- So $ EU(A1) = -q + 3(1 - q) = -q + 3 - 3q = 3 - 4q $

Compare:
- Is $ q + 4 > 3 - 4q $ for all $ q \in [0,1] $?

$ q + 4 > 3 - 4q $
→ $ q + 4q > 3 - 4 $
→ $ 5q > -1 $

Which is **always true** since $ q \geq 0 $

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1.

Therefore, **optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability**

Even though when you play A0 and other plays A0, you get no net benefit from contract (gain +4, lose -4), the base payoff is 5 — which is better than the downside of A1.

And if other plays A1, you get +4 from contract (since you play A0), which is better than getting only 3 from A1.

In the A1 vs A0 case, you get -1 — worse than A0’s 4.

So **A0 is dominant**.

---

### Step 7: Final answer

You should play **A0 with 100% probability**.

Thus, the output is:

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without the contract)

We are playing a simultaneous-move game where both players choose between **A0** and **A1**, and payoffs are determined as follows:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5           | 5                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 3           | 3                      |

This is a symmetric game, and you are playing as **Player 2**.

But note: the contract was **proposed by Player 2**, but **rejected by Player 2** — so it's **not active**. Therefore, we ignore the contract and play the game under the original rules.

### Step 2: Analyze the game structure

Let’s denote:
- You (Player 2) play A0 with probability **p**
- The other player (Player 1) plays A0 with probability **q**

We want to find the best **mixed strategy** for you (Player 2) to maximize your expected payoff, assuming the other player is also rational and will play optimally.

But since this is a one-shot game and you're choosing your strategy **without** knowing the other player’s move, we need to consider **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s compute the expected payoffs.

---

### Step 3: Compute expected payoff for Player 2

Let’s define:
- You choose A0 with probability **p**, A1 with probability **1 - p**
- The opponent chooses A0 with probability **q**, A1 with probability **1 - q**

Then your expected payoff is:
```
E = p * [q * 5 + (1 - q) * 0] + (1 - p) * [q * 3 + (1 - q) * 3]
```

Simplify:
```
E = p * [5q] + (1 - p) * [3]
= 5pq + 3(1 - p)
= 5pq + 3 - 3p
```

Now, your goal is to choose **p** (between 0 and 1) to maximize **E**, but **q** is unknown. So we must assume the opponent is choosing **q** optimally as well — i.e., we are looking for a Nash equilibrium.

But in zero-sum or symmetric games like this, we can look for mixed strategy Nash equilibria.

---

### Step 4: Look for mixed strategy Nash equilibrium

Let’s suppose that **Player 1** mixes with probability **q**.

We want to find the value of **q** such that **you are indifferent between A0 and A1**, then your best response is to mix accordingly (but actually, in equilibrium, both players will be indifferent).

So let’s compute your expected payoff for choosing A0 and A1, given the opponent’s strategy q.

**If you play A0:**
- With probability q, opponent plays A0 → you get 5
- With probability 1 - q, opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- Expected payoff: **5q**

**If you play A1:**
- With probability q, opponent plays A0 → you get 3
- With probability 1 - q, opponent plays A1 → you get 3
- Expected payoff: **3**

To make you indifferent between A0 and A1, set:
```
5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6
```

So if the other player plays A0 with probability **0.6**, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Therefore, **in Nash equilibrium**, Player 1 will play A0 with probability **60%**, so you are indifferent.

Similarly, we can check what Player 2’s best response should be.

By symmetry, since the game is symmetric (same payoff structure for both players in each outcome), the symmetric Nash equilibrium will have both players using the same strategy.

So if Player 1 plays A0 with 60%, then Player 2 (you) should play A0 with **60%** to make the opponent indifferent.

Let’s verify that.

Suppose **you** (Player 2) play A0 with probability **p**, and **Player 1** plays A0 with probability **q**.

For **Player 1** to be indifferent between A0 and A1:

- If Player 1 plays A0: payoff = p * 5 + (1 - p) * 0 = 5p
- If Player 1 plays A1: payoff = p * 3 + (1 - p) * 3 = 3

Set equal:  
5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So yes — **both players playing A0 with probability 60%** is a symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

---

### Step 5: Is this the best strategy?

Yes, in a one-shot game, the optimal strategy (in equilibrium) is to play A0 with **60%** probability, and A1 with **40%**.

This is because:
- Any deviation can be exploited if the opponent plays predictably.
- But this strategy ensures you get **expected payoff of 3** (in equilibrium), no matter what the other player does, if they also are playing optimally.

Let’s compute your expected payoff if you play p = 0.6, and opponent plays q = 0.6:

E = 5pq + 3 - 3p = 5*(0.6)*(0.6) + 3 - 3*(0.6) = 5*0.36 + 3 - 1.8 = 1.8 + 3 - 1.8 = 3

Alternatively, since you are indifferent between A0 and A1 when the opponent plays q = 0.6, and you play p = 0.6, your payoff is 3.

This is stable.

### Step 6: Final answer

You are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.

We have determined that the Nash equilibrium strategy for Player 2 (you) is to play:
- A0: 60%
- A1: 40%

And the sum is 60 + 40 = 100, which is valid.

This maximizes your expected payoff **assuming the other player is also rational and plays optimally**.

Even if they are not, playing 60% A0 is robust because it avoids being exploited (e.g., if you always play A0, opponent can play A1 and get 3, you get 0 — bad).

So, 60% A0 is the optimal mixed strategy.
