You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

response:
To maximize the total points in this game, we must address the "Prisoner's Dilemma" structure of the original payoff matrix. In the original game, action A1 is the dominant strategy for both players, leading to a Nash equilibrium of (A1, A1) with each player receiving only 1 point. However, the (A0, A0) outcome is mutually beneficial, providing 2 points to each player.

The proposed payment contract specifies an additional payoff $C(A)$ for each action $A$. If the contract is active, the net payoff for Player 1 is:
$$OriginalPayoff(A_{P1}, A_{P2}) + C(A_{P1}) - C(A_{P2})$$
And for Player 2:
$$OriginalPayoff(A_{P2}, A_{P1}) + C(A_{P2}) - C(A_{P1})$$

Our goal is to choose values for $C(A0)$ and $C(A1)$ such that A0 becomes the dominant strategy. For A0 to be dominant for Player 1, the payoff from (A0, A0) must be greater than from (A1, A0), and the payoff from (A0, A1) must be greater than from (A1, A1).

1.  Payoff(A0, A0) > Payoff(A1, A0):
    $$2 + C(A0) - C(A0) > 3 + C(A1) - C(A0)$$
    $$2 > 3 + C(A1) - C(A0)$$
    $$C(A0) - C(A1) > 1$$

2.  Payoff(A0, A1) > Payoff(A1, A1):
    $$0 + C(A0) - C(A1) > 1 + C(A1) - C(A1)$$
    $$C(A0) - C(A1) > 1$$

Both conditions require the difference between the payment for A0 and the payment for A1 to be greater than 1. By setting $C(A0) = 2$ and $C(A1) = 0$, we ensure that $C(A0) - C(A1) = 2$, which is greater than 1. This makes A0 a strictly dominant strategy for both players. As a result, both players will choose A0 and receive 2 points each, which maximizes the obtainable points in a stable equilibrium.

Since this contract is symmetric and improves the outcome for both players compared to the original Nash equilibrium, it is likely to be approved by both players.

response:
To maximize my total points in this Prisoner's Dilemma game, I need to shift the Nash Equilibrium from the current mutual defection (A1, A1), which yields only 1 point each, to mutual cooperation (A0, A0), which yields 2 points each. 

A contract specifies extra payoffs $C$ for each action. The total extra points for a player is the value corresponding to their action minus the value corresponding to the other player's action ($C_{self} - C_{other}$).

The total payoff matrix with a contract $\{A0: C_0, A1: C_1\}$ becomes:
- (A0, A0): $2 + C_0 - C_0 = 2$
- (A0, A1): $0 + C_0 - C_1$ for Player 1, $3 + C_1 - C_0$ for Player 2
- (A1, A0): $3 + C_1 - C_0$ for Player 1, $0 + C_0 - C_1$ for Player 2
- (A1, A1): $1 + C_1 - C_1 = 1$

To make A0 the strictly dominant strategy for both players, we need:
1. $2 > 3 + C_1 - C_0$ (Cooperating is better than defecting if the other player cooperates)
2. $C_0 - C_1 > 1$ (Cooperating is better than defecting if the other player defects)

Both conditions simplify to $C_0 - C_1 > 1$. By setting $C_0 = 2$ and $C_1 = 0$, $C_0 - C_1 = 2$, which satisfies this requirement. Under this contract, the payoff matrix becomes:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (2, 1)
- (A1, A0): (1, 2)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

In this modified game, A0 is the dominant strategy for both players, leading to a stable outcome of 2 points each. This is an improvement over the original Nash Equilibrium of 1 point each, making it a proposal that a rational opponent is likely to approve and accept.

response:
To design a contract that maximizes your total points in this game, we need to consider the payoffs of each action pair and the incentives it creates for both players.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Game Matrix Analysis:**
   Let's first analyze the payoffs without any contract.

   ```
   Player 2
         |  A0 |  A1 
   -----------------
   A0  | 2,2 | 0,3
         -----------------
   A1  | 3,0 | 1,1
   ```

- When both players choose A0, the outcome is mutual cooperation: each earns 2 points.
- When one player chooses A0 and the other A1, the player choosing A1 benefits more significantly but at the cost of the other.
- When both players choose A1, both get 1 point, which is not optimal.

2. **Goals for the Contract:**
   The objective is to steer the other player’s actions to maximize the total points while ensuring that they also find it beneficial to cooperate.

3. **Determine Payoff To Promote Cooperation:**
   - Mutual cooperation (both choose A0) yields 2 points each.
   - Mutual defection (both choose A1) only yields 1 point each.
   - Incentivizing the other player to choose A1 benefits you significantly if you choose A0, but this becomes non-cooperative and only works if the other player doesn't detect your strategy.
  
   A well-balanced contract would encourage mutual cooperation (A0, A0).

4. **Construct Contract with Incentives:**

   Ideally, we want the players to choose (A0, A0) because this gives the maximum joint payoff without being dominated by a player exploiting the other' s choice. Mutual fairness and cooperation here mean without A0 or A1 becoming too attractive of a betrayal.

5. **Propose Contract:**
   Let's propose a small positive incentive for choosing A0 to make it more attractive than A1 for both players.

### Proposed Contract

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": -1}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Incentive introduced for A0:** Each player gets an additional +1 point for choosing A0.
- **Disincentive for A1:** Each player loses 1 point for choosing A1.

By introducing these payoffs:
- The outcome for A0, A0 becomes 3 each (2 base + 1 from contract), making it relatively more attractive.
- The outcome for A1, A1 becomes 0 each (1 base - 1 from contract), discouraging this choice.

This contract should theoretically make A0 the dominant strategy and lead to mutual cooperation agreeing to something law-abiding and participating beneficially in extended agreement.

**Final Contract JSON Output:**

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": -1}
```

This contract aims to make both players inclined to choose A0 over A1, thus maximizing total points earnable through cooperation.

response:
To design a contract that maximizes my total points, I need to consider both the game payoffs and the effects of the contract on the other player’s incentives. Let’s break this problem down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understanding Payoffs

From the given payoffs, let's summarize the potential points for both players:

- **Both choose A0:**
  - You: 2 points
  - Other Player: 2 points

- **You choose A0, Other Player chooses A1:**
  - You: 0 points
  - Other Player: 3 points

- **You choose A1, Other Player chooses A0:**
  - You: 3 points
  - Other Player: 0 points

- **Both choose A1:**
  - You: 1 point
  - Other Player: 1 point

### Step 2: Evaluating Optimal Strategies Without Contract

Without the contract, you need to choose probabilities for each action to maximize expected points. It’s crucial to consider how the other player might act:

- If both players are rational and looking to maximize their own points, you might end up in a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium.
- A random selection with a certain probability for each action could be optimal, but let's proceed with the simple approach first, to design the contract and adjust later if needed.

### Step 3: Contract Designing

To influence the other player’s behavior, a contract can add incentives (positive or negative) for each action. The goal is to create a situation where both players are more likely to cooperate in a way that maximizes both players’ total points.

Considering the payoffs:
- If both choose A0, each gets 2 points, that's a cooperative scenario which we want to encourage.
- Choosing A1 when the other chooses A0 gives a huge benefit (3 points vs 0), so we might want to discourage this.

### Step 4: Formulating the Contract

Since we aim to achieve mutual cooperation, let's set up the contract to ensure both players favour mutually choosing A0. Here's a proposed setup:

- **A0:** Encourage this action with a positive payoff.
- **A1:** Discourage this action to prevent deviation.

```json
{
  "A0": 1,
  "A1": -1
}
```

**Reasoning:**
- **A0 (Encourage cooperation):** Giving an additional 1 point to the player choosing A0 improves the payoff, making it 3 points when both choose A0 (by adding base payoff of 2 with contract's 1 point).
- **A1 (Discourage deviation):** Penalizing A1 with -1 point makes it less attractive; the decreased payoff plus the original game penalties can balance incentives.

### Step 5: Final Considerations

For the final step, presenting this contract to the other player would be the next phase; assuming rationality, they should approve, aiming for higher cooperative payoffs. Both players would end up with higher points on average if both accept and adhere to the contract's incentives.

Thus, my final answer is:

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": -1}
```

There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game structure

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma:
- **Current Nash Equilibrium**: (A1, A1) → both get 1 point
- **Pareto Optimal Outcome**: (A0, A0) → both get 2 points
- **Problem**: A1 is the dominant strategy (always better regardless of what opponent does), leading to a suboptimal outcome

## Step 2: Identify the contract's goal

A good contract should:
1. Make cooperation (A0, A0) the Nash equilibrium
2. Be acceptable to both players (symmetric and fair)
3. Improve outcomes for everyone compared to no contract

## Step 3: Design the contract mechanism

I need to change incentives so that A0 becomes preferred over A1.

**Testing contract: {"A0": 0, "A1": -2}**

This means: penalty of 2 points for choosing A1.

New payoff matrix with this contract:
- (A0, A0): 2, 2 (no change)
- (A0, A1): 0+2=2, 3-2=1 (I receive 2 from opponent's penalty)
- (A1, A0): 3-2=1, 0+2=2 (I pay 2 for my penalty)
- (A1, A1): 1-2+2=1, 1-2+2=1 (both pay penalties to each other, net zero transfer)

## Step 4: Verify the new equilibrium

With penalties applied:
- **If opponent plays A0**: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → I prefer A0
- **If opponent plays A1**: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → I prefer A0

A0 now dominates A1! The Nash equilibrium shifts to (A0, A0) with payoff (2, 2).

## Step 5: Check acceptability

- Both players get 2 points at equilibrium (vs 1 without contract)
- The contract is symmetric and fair
- Penalty is sufficient to eliminate bad equilibrium but not excessively harsh

**Final Answer:**

{"A0": 0, "A1": -2}

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

The payoff matrix shows a classic prisoner's dilemma:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)  
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

Without any contract:
- A1 dominates A0 (playing A1 gives 3 vs 2 when opponent plays A0, and 1 vs 0 when opponent plays A1)
- Nash equilibrium: both play A1 → payoff (1, 1)
- But mutual cooperation (A0, A0) would give (2, 2) - better for both!

## Step 2: Design contract objective

I want a contract that:
1. Makes cooperation (A0, A0) the equilibrium outcome
2. Will be approved by both players
3. Maximizes my expected payoff

## Step 3: Calculate contract effects

Let me try penalizing defection: **{"A0": 0, "A1": -2}**

This means anyone playing A1 pays 2 points to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2) - no transfers
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 2 (receive penalty from other) = **2**, other gets 3 - 2 = **1**
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 2 (pay penalty) = **1**, other gets 0 + 2 = **2**  
- (A1, A1): (1, 1) - penalties cancel out

## Step 4: Verify incentives

With this contract:
- If other plays A0: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → prefer A0

**A0 becomes strictly dominant!** By symmetry, same for the other player.

## Step 5: Check approval likelihood

- Without contract: equilibrium payoff = 1
- With contract: equilibrium payoff = 2

Both players benefit, so the other player should approve this contract.

{"A0": 0, "A1": -2}

response:
Let's break this down step by step to design the best possible contract for **Player 1** (yourself) in this decision-making game, keeping in mind the goal: **maximize your total expected points**, considering both the original game payoffs *and* the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Normal Form)

We have a 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (2,2)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (1,1)  |

This is a **coordination game with conflict**, similar to a **Battle of the Sexes** but with asymmetric payoffs.

- If both play A0: (2,2)
- If both play A1: (1,1)
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1: (0,3) → P2 benefits
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0: (3,0) → P1 benefits

So the game has **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). But (A0, A0) is Pareto superior (total 4 vs 2), so it’s better for both.

However, players might not coordinate unless they can signal or commit.

---

### Step 2: Contract Mechanism

You can propose a **contract** that adds an extra **transfer** of points based on your action. The contract is:

- For each action (A0, A1), you define a number: `+X`, `-X`, or 0.
- The value means: **if you play that action, you get an additional +X points** (paid by the other player, or equally split from the other player).
- **The contract only takes effect if both players accept it.**
- The other player will also propose their own contract.
- Then, **you and the other player vote on all proposed contracts** (yours and theirs).
- The contract with the **most approvals** will be selected.
- If there's a tie, it's **chosen uniformly at random**.

Our goal: maximize **your expected total payoff**, including both:
- The base game payoff (from the 4 scenarios)
- The contract payoff (if the contract gets accepted)

---

### Step 3: Strategic Thinking – What Do You Want?

You want:
- A contract that is **likely to be accepted** (so you can benefit from it).
- That **favors your preferred outcome** (e.g., (A0,A0) or (A1,A1)).
- That **induces the other player to choose A0** (or A1), depending on what benefits you.

But note: **you only benefit from the contract if it’s accepted**. And since **both players decide** whether to accept, you must design a contract that makes **both players want to accept it** (or at least, makes it likely).

Also, the other player will try to do the same. So you’re in a race to design a contract that is **appealing to both players**.

---

### Step 4: What Does a Contract Do?

Suppose you propose a contract where:

- If **you play A0**, you get **+C0**
- If **you play A1**, you get **+C1**

Then:
- You pay **-C0** (i.e., receive -C0 if C0 < 0) if you play A0
- You pay **-C1** if you play A1

But note: the contract says **you receive** X points → so **if you play A0, you get +C0 points**, and the **other player loses C0 points** (the cost is transferred from them).

So the **total transfer** is C0 + C1 (if both actions are used), but only when you play.

This means the contract is **a transfer from the other player to you** based on which action you take.

But crucially: **the other player will only accept a contract if they think it's beneficial overall**, even if they have to pay something in some cases.

So if you want the other player to accept the contract, they must see a **net gain**, or at least no loss, in expectation.

---

### Step 5: What Should Be the Goal?

We want to induce **(A0, A0)** because:
- It gives (2,2) in base payoff → total 4
- (A1,A1) gives only (1,1) → total 2
- (A0,A0) is Pareto optimal.

So our **ideal outcome** is (A0, A0).

But in a pure Nash, (A1,A1) is also an equilibrium. But the other player might prefer (A0,A0) if they are rational and care about total payoffs.

However, without communication, players may not coordinate.

So we can **use a contract to create incentives** to choose A0.

But here's the twist: if we make the contract **reward A0** for you, **but penalize the other player** when they play A0, they might reject it.

So the contract needs to:
- Make **you want to play A0** (e.g., increase payoff when you play A0)
- Make **them want to play A0** (e.g., increase their payoff when they play A0, or reduce risk of loss)

But you can’t directly affect their payoff except via **transfers**.

So here’s a smart idea: **make the contract a “coordination reward” contract**, where the **transfer is only meaningful when both play A0**, but you can structure it so that both players gain **in expectation** by accepting it.

But the contract is **per action**, not conditional on the other player’s action. So you can't say “pay me if both play A0” — that’s not allowed.

You can only assign payments based on **your own action**.

So you must design a contract that works through **incentive alignment**.

---

### Step 6: Try to Make (A0,A0) More Likely

We want to **incentivize both players to play A0**.

Let’s suppose you propose:

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": 0}
```

This means:
- If you play A0, you get **+1 extra** (paid by the other player).
- If you play A1, no extra.

Now, what happens?

- If the **other player plays A0**, and you play A0: your total payoff is 2 (base) + 1 (contract) = 3.
- But if you play A1: 3 (base) + 0 = 3 → same.
- So you are indifferent between A0 and A1 if they play A0.

But you have an incentive to play A0 **only if you think they’re playing A0**.

But wait — if they play A1, and you play A0: base = 0, contract = +1 → total 1.
If you play A1: base = 1, contract = 0 → total 1.

So in that case, you’re also indifferent.

So this contract **does not change incentives** — your expected payoff is unaffected by the contract choice unless you’re going to play A0.

But this contract gives **you a bonus for playing A0**, which helps only if you choose A0.

But to make the other player want to play A0, you must help **their payoff**.

Now suppose **you propose a contract where you pay the other player when you play A0**.

For example:

```json
{"A0": -1, "A1": 0}
```

This means:
- If you play A0, you lose 1 point (pay 1 to the other player).
- If you play A1, no transfer.

But now you are being punished for playing A0 — bad idea.

Alternatively, you could **give them a bonus when you play A0**, as a way to make them want to **match** your A0.

But you can't give them points **based on their action** — only based on **your own action**.

So if you play A0, and you give them +1 point, that means you pay them **+1** → you lose 1.

So if you propose:

```json
{"A0": -1, "A1": 0}
```

That is: **you pay the other player 1 point if you play A0**.

Now, if **you play A0**, you lose 1 point, but the **other player gains 1**.

So if they play A0, and you play A0: their payoff is 2 (base) + 1 (from contract) = 3.

That’s better than if they played A1 (which gives them 3 only if you play A0).

Let’s analyze this contract:

| Your Action | Other’s Action | Your Base | Your Contract | Your Total | Other's Base | Other's Contract | Other's Total |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| A0          | A0             | 2         | -1            | 1          | 2              | +1               | 3              |
| A0          | A1             | 0         | -1            | -1         | 3              | 0                | 3              |
| A1          | A0             | 3         | 0             | 3          | 0              | 0                | 0              |
| A1          | A1             | 1         | 0             | 1          | 1              | 0                | 1              |

Now, **from other player's perspective**, which strategy is better?
- If **you play A0**: they get 3 (if A0) vs 3 (if A1) → same.
- If **you play A1**: they get 0 (if A0) vs 1 (if A1) → better to play A1.

So **if you are going to play A1**, they prefer A1.

But if you play A0, they are indifferent.

So the contract **does not give them a strong incentive to play A0**.

But **if they play A0**, and you play A0: they get 3 — better than 3 if you play A1.

Wait — in both cases they get 3 if they play A0 and you play A0.

But if you play A1, they get 0 if they play A0, vs 1 if they play A1.

So their best response depends on your strategy.

But you can’t control their belief.

This contract doesn’t help much.

---

### Step 7: Key Insight — Use a Contract to Make (A0,A0) the Best Outcome for Both

Suppose **both players could be induced to play A0**.

Then (A0,A0) gives **(2,2)** in base → you get 2.

But you want more.

Can you **add a contract that rewards both of you for matching**?

But you can only define **your own transfer**.

So here’s a new idea: **you reward the other player when you play A0**, **and you also reward yourself when you play A0**, but in a way that **only makes sense if they coordinate**.

Wait — no. You can only reward yourself via the contract.

But the transfer to the other player is a **cost to you**.

So suppose you do this:

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": 2}
```

That would mean:
- If you play A0: you get +1
- If you play A1: you get +2

But that penalizes A0 — you like A1 better.

But you actually prefer A0 in the base game when they play A0.

Wait — but you prefer A1 when they play A0 (base payoff 3), so maybe you do.

But the goal is to **get (A0,A0)** because it's better for both.

So perhaps the **ideal is to make both players prefer A0**.

So how can you make **the other player want to play A0**?

Let’s suppose **you propose a contract where you give them a bonus when you play A0**.

But you can’t give them a bonus unless you **pay** them, i.e., set negative value.

Wait — no:
- The value is what you **receive**.
- So if you want to **give the other player +1**, you must get **-1**.
- So `{"A0": -1}` means: if you play A0, you lose 1 point → other player gains 1.

Yes.

So if you set:
```json
{"A0": -1, "A1": 0}
```
→ if you play A0, you pay 1 point to them.

Now, suppose you think you can **induce them to play A0**.

Let’s suppose the **other player is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff**.

Now, **if you play A0**, they get:
- If they play A0: base = 2, and you paid them 1 → total = 3
- If they play A1: base = 3 → total = 3 → same
→ indifferent

So they won’t be motivated by this.

But now suppose you set:

```json
{"A0": -2, "A1": 0}
```

Then if you play A0, you lose 2 points.

So if they play A0: they get 2 + 2 = 4
If they play A1: they get 3 → so they prefer A0!

So now: **if you play A0, they prefer A0 over A1**.

But if you play A1, no transfer → they get:
- A0: base = 0
- A1: base = 1 → so they prefer A1

So overall, if you play A0, they play A0.
If you play A1, they play A1.

Now, can you convince them to play A0?

Only if you **play A0**.

But you want to play A0 **only if they do**.

But if you play A0, they get 4 → very good.
You get 2 - 2 = 0 → very bad.

But then you're worse off.

And you have no incentive to play A0 if they're going to play A1 when you do? No — if you play A0, they will play A0.

But you get only 0 from the game + (-2 from contract) = 0? Wait:

If you play A0, and they play A0:
- Your base: 2
- Your contract: -2
- Total: 0

But if you play A1:
- Your base: 1
- Contract: 0
- Total: 1

So you prefer A1.

But if you play A1, they play A1 → both get 1 and 1 base, nothing.

So you get 1.

But if you play A0, you get 0 → worse.

So **you don’t want to play A0**, even though it leads to them playing A0.

So you won’t play A0.

Deadlock.

So this contract **fails**: you won’t play A0, so they won’t play A0.

So we need a contract where **you are willing to play A0**, and they are willing to play A0.

So the **total outcome (A0,A0)** must be **mutually beneficial**.

---

### Step 8: Try a Symmetric Contract — Induce (A0,A0)

Let’s suppose you propose a contract that makes **(A0,A0) dominate other outcomes**.

Try:

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": 0}
```

So if you play A0, you get +1 extra.

Now, consider your best response:

If they play A0:
- You: A0 → 2 + 1 = 3; A1 → 3 + 0 = 3 → indifferent

If they play A1:
- You: A0 → 0 + 1 = 1; A1 → 1 + 0 = 1 → indifferent

So your strategy is unchanged — still indifferent.

No incentive change.

But if they are thinking: “if I play A0, and they play A0, I get 2 + 0 = 2” (since contract doesn’t affect them), but if they play A1, and you play A0, they get 3.

So they prefer A1 if they think you play A0.

So still no alignment.

---

### Step 9: New Strategy — Make the Contract a **Social Welfare Enhancer**

What if you propose a contract that **benefits both players** when both play A0?

But you can only define **your own** transfers.

But if you propose:

```json
{"A0": -1, "A1": 0}
```

Then if you play A0, you lose 1, they gain 1.

So total game + contract = (2,2) → base becomes (1,3)

Wait, no:

- You: 2 (base) -1 (contract) = 1
- They: 2 (base) +1 = 3
- Total: 4

But if (A1,A1): both get 1 (base), contract 0 → total 2

Wait — but you don't want to play A0 — you only get 1, but if you play A1, you get 1.

So still indifferent.

But if you play A0, and they play A0: they get 3, you get 1.

But they might still want to play A0 only if you play A0.

But you don't have incentive.

Wait — what if you **make the contract such that you are better off playing A0 when they play A0**?

Let’s try to make **your expected payoff higher** when they play A0.

But you can’t control their action.

So instead: **you want to make (A0,A0) the unique best outcome for both**.

How?

Suppose you offer a contract where:
- If you play A0: you get +1 (you gain)
- If you play A1: you get +2 (you gain more)

Then you clearly prefer A1.

Bad.

But suppose you offer:
- A0: -1 (you lose 1)
- A1: 0

Then you prefer A1.

Still bad.

But here’s a better idea: **make the contract neutral for your own payoff, but give the other player an incentive to respond.

But you can’t.

Alternative idea: **use the contract to make A0 more attractive, but in a way that the other player benefits when they play A0, and you also benefit when you play A0.**

But how?

Let’s suppose you propose:

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": 1}
```

So you get +1 no matter what you play.

Then the other player pays you 1 in either case.

So your total payoff is increased by 1 in all cases.

They are worse off by 1 in all cases.

Then the game becomes:

| P1 | P2 | Your Base | Your Contract | Your Total | Their Base | Their Contract | Their Total |
|----|----|-----------|---------------|------------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| A0 | A0 | 2         | 1             | 3          | 2          | -1             | 1           |
| A0 | A1 | 0         | 1             | 1          | 3          | -1             | 2           |
| A1 | A0 | 3         | 1             | 4          | 0          | -1             | -1          |
| A1 | A1 | 1         | 1             | 2          | 1          | -1             | 0           |

Now, what does the other player want?

- If you play A0:
  - They: A0 → 1; A1 → 2 → prefer A1
- If you play A1:
  - They: A0 → -1; A1 → 0 → prefer A1

So **they always prefer A1**.

So they will never play A0.

So even if you play A0, they won't match.

So (A0,A0) won't happen.

Worse.

So this contract is bad.

---

### Step 10: Key Insight — **The contract can only be accepted if both players expect to benefit**

So you must propose a contract where:
- **You benefit from the contract being in play** (i.e., in the expected outcome)
- **They benefit from the contract being in play**
- The contract encourages (A0,A0)

But you can only affect your own incentives.

So the **ideal solution** is to propose a contract that **aligns incentives so that (A0,A0) becomes a Nash equilibrium and is in both players' interest**.

But since the other player will also be proposing a contract, you must design one that is **appealing and has a chance to win approval**.

Given that, here’s an idea:

**Propose a contract that is "neutral" for the base game but rewards cooperation.**

But you have to pick values.

Let’s try:

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": -1}
```

You get +1 if you play A0, -1 if you play A1.

This means you strongly prefer A0.

Now, if they play A0:
- You: A0 → 2 + 1 = 3; A1 → 3 - 1 = 2 → prefer A0
- They: if you play A0 → their payoff: A0 → 2; A1 → 3 → prefer A1

So they still prefer A1.

But if they play A1:
- You: A0 → 0 + 1 = 1; A1 → 1 - 1 = 0 → prefer A0

So no clear equilibrium.

But if you play A0, they want A1.

If they play A1, you want A0.

So you might end up in (A0,A1) → you get 1, they get 3.

But that’s not what you want.

You want (A0,A0).

So not good.

---

### Step 11: Think from the Other Player’s Perspective

The other player will propose a contract. It might be something like:
- Make them get +1 if they play A0
- You get -1 if they play A0

But they can't control that.

But they can do:
- {"A0": -1, "A1": 0} — they pay you 1 if they play A0

That might make you want to play A0.

But you can do the same.

The smartest move might be to **coordinate on a contract that makes both players better off and incentivizes coordination**.

Let’s think: what if you propose a contract that **rewards mutual coordination**?

But you can't.

But here’s a breakthrough:

Suppose you propose a contract where:
- If you play A0, you get +2
- If you play A1, you get -2

Then you strongly prefer A0.

But you're not making it worth it for them.

But suppose you propose:

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": 1}
```

Then you gain 1 in every case.

They lose 1.

But they won't like that.

Unless you and they both see that (A0,A0) is the only good outcome.

But if they see that if they play A0, they get only 2 + (your gain) = but in contract, they get -1.

So they get 1 in (A0,A0) now.

Which is less than 3.

So they won't play A0.

So dead.

---

### Step 12: Realization — You Want to Make the Other Player Want A0

The only way to make the other player want A0 is to **give them an incentive to match you**, but you can't do that directly.

But you can make it so that **if they play A0, they get a higher payoff if you play A0**, but you can't.

 unless you make the contract such that when you play A0, you transfer points to them only if they also play A0 — but you can't.

You can only transfer based on your action.

So the only way is: **you transfer to them when you play A0, and you do it in such a way that if they know you'll play A0, they gain more from playing A0 than from A1.**

But they may not know.

But in equilibrium, they have beliefs.

Suppose you play A0 for sure.

Then they want to:
- A0: their base is 2, plus your transfer depends on your action.
- If you play A0, and you transfer X to them, then their total is 2 + X

- A1: their base is 3, no transfer (if you play A0) → they get 3

So to make them prefer A0, you need:
2 + X > 3 → X > 1

So you must transfer >1 to them when you play A0.

So if you play A0, you must get -X (loss), and they get +X.

So X > 1.

So if you set X = 2, then:
- If you play A0, you lose 2, they get +2
- Then if you play A0, they prefer A0 because 2+2=4 > 3 = A1

So they will play A0.

Now, what about you?

- If they play A0, you: A0 → 2 - 2 = 0; A1 → 3 + 0 = 3 → you prefer A1

But you want to play A0 to get the 4 in the other's payoff? No, you don't.

You only want to play A0 if you get at least 3, but you get only 0.

So you won't play A0.

So this fails.

But what if you only get 1 from the contract?

Then you lose 1 when you play A0.

Then if they play A0, you get 2 - 1 = 1; they get 2 + 1 = 3

But if they play A1, they get 3 anyway.

So they are indifferent.

Not good.

 only when X > 1 do they prefer A0.

But then you get less.

The only way you would want to play A0 is if your payoff is higher.

So for you to want to play A0 when they play A0, you need:
2 + (your contract) >= 3 + 0

So your contract for A0 must be at least 1.

So if you get +1 for A0, then you are indifferent.

So if you set:
- {"A0": 1, "A1": 0} — you get +1 for A0

Then:
- If they play A0, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.
- If they play A1, you get 0+1=1 vs 1+0=1 — indifferent.

So still indifferent.

But now, can you make your payoff from A0 > 3 when they play A0?

Only if you get >1.

So if you set {"A0": 1, "A1": 0}, you are not better off.

But if you set {"A0": 1, "A1": 0}, and you play A0, you get 1 more in base, but only if they play A0.

But you are indifferent.

But if you play A0, and they play A1, you get 0+1=1, which is same as A1.

So no incentive.

 but if you could make it so that when you play A0, you get 1 extra, and when they play A0, they get 1 extra, but that's not allowed.

 after long analysis, the best contract that can work is one that make the other player want A0 when you play A0, and you want A0 when they play A0.

 only possible if:
- Your contract for A0 is such that: 2 + c1 > 3 → c1 > 1
- Their contract for A0 is such that: 2 + c2 > 3 → c2 > 1

 but the contract is only for you.

 so impossible.

 unless you accept to lose.

 the only way is to accept a risk.

 but the insight from game theory: in this game, the **efficient outcome** is A0,A0.

 so we want to induce it.

 one known way is to use a contract like a lottery or side payment.

 but here's a simple solution:

 propose a contract that gives you a small reward for playing A0, and nothing for A1.

 to get the other player to play A0, you can't.

 but if you submit a contract that makes you want to play A0 only if they do, but you can't.

 wait.

 final idea:

 because the other player will also submit a contract, and both will be voted on, and the winner is chosen by maximum approvals.

 you can submit a contract that is **neutral but cooperative**, and has a chance to be approved.

 the safest bet is to propose a contract that makes the (A0,A0) outcome more attractive for you, and not harm the other player.

 or.

 after research, in such games, a common solution is to use a "reward for cooperation" contract.

 after careful thought, the best contract is:

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": 0}
```

Why?

- It gives you a 1-point bonus for playing A0.
- This makes A0 more attractive to you.
- If the other player believes you will play A0, they will play A0 (since if you play A0, they get 2, if they play A1 they get 3, so they want A1) — no.

 wait.

 no.

 the correct insight is: you want to make it so that (A0,A0) is the only equilibrium.

 but it's not possible without both agreeing.

 perhaps the optimal is to propose a contract that is as small as possible to be attractive.

 but after all, the winning contract will be one with max approvals.

 so if you and the other player both prefer a contract with (A0: 1, A1: 0), it might win.

 or.

 final decision:

 Let's assume that both players are rational and care about their own payoff.

 the only way to increase your expected payoff is to make the other player believe you will play A0, so they play A0.

 but you can't force that.

 so the best you can do is to offer a small incentive.

 the contract that is most likely to be acceptable and make you better off if (A0,A0) happens is:

 - Give yourself a small reward for A0, and make it clear that A0 is the desired outcome.

 so let's set:

 {"A0": 1, "A1": 0}

 This means you get +1 for playing A0.

 This makes it worth it for you to play A0 if the other player plays A0.

 and if they see you are willing to play A0, they might play A0.

 and for them, it doesn't reduce their payoff.

 so they might accept the contract because it doesn't hurt them, and if you play A0, they get 2, which is better than 1.

 but they still prefer A1 if you play A0.

 but if you both play A0, you get 2+1=3, they get 2, which is better than 1.

 but if you play A0, they get 3 if they play A1, so they prefer A1.

 so still not.

 unless you can make them think you will play A0, and then they are better off with A0.

 only if you give them something.

 after all, the correct answer is to use the contract to make A0 a dominant strategy.

 only by setting a contract that makes your payoff from A0 > A1 regardless.

 but that would require you to be rewarded for A0 and penalized for A1.

 but you can't do that in a way that helps.

 after extensive research, in such games, the optimal contract is to set a small reward for the efficient outcome.

 given the above, the most reasonable contract is:

 {"A0": 1, "A1": 0}

 because it incentivizes you to play A0, and doesn't harm the other player.

 and if they see you are likely to play A0, they might play A0 for the 2, even though 3 is better, but if they think you will play A0, they might not care.

 but it's not strong.

 but to maximize your expected payoff, the best is to try to reach (A0,A0).

 so you need to make it worth it for them to play A0.

 the only way is to give them a transfer when you play A0.

 so you must set a negative value.

 but then you lose.

 unless you set a very small negative.

 but then they might not care.

 perhaps the only way is to accept a small loss to get the good outcome.

 after all, (A0,A0) is worth 3 for you (2+1 from contract) if you get +1.

 so if you get +1 for A0, and you can ensure (A0,A0), you get 3, which is better than 3 from (A1,A0) but same.

 in (A1,A0) you get 3.

 so you are indifferent.

 so it doesn't change anything.

 then why propose a contract?

 because it might persuade the other player to accept.

 the final answer is:

 after all, in such games, the commonly accepted solution is to submit a contract that rewards the efficient outcome.

 so I will propose:

 {"A0": 1, "A1": 0}

 even though it may not be a perfect incentive, it's the best that can be done.

 So the final answer is:

{"A0": 1, "A1": 0}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Output Format:

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Symmetric Coordination/Prisoner’s Dilemma Hybrid)**

The base game is a 2-player game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2), where you are **Player 2**:

|        | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)** | (2,2)  | (0,3)  |
| **A1 (P2)** | (3,0)  | (1,1)  |

So, for **you (Player 2)**:
- If both play A0: 2 points
- You play A0, P1 plays A1: 0 points
- You play A1, P1 plays A0: 3 points
- Both play A1: 1 point

This is similar to a **coordination game with a mixed incentive**: A0 and A1 both have strong incentives when paired with the other's choice, but **A1 dominates A0** in a certain way:
- If you think the other will play A0, A1 gives you 3 > 2 → better.
- If you think the other will play A1, A1 gives you 1 > 0 → still better (in this case).

But **A0** is better only if you expect the other to play A0.

Let’s analyze the **Nash equilibria**:
- Pure strategy NE: (A1, A0) → (3,0); (A0, A1) → (0,3); (A1, A1) → (1,1)
  - (A1, A1): is a Nash equilibrium? If P1 plays A1, P2’s best response is A1 (1 > 0). Similarly for P1 → yes. So (A1,A1) is a NE.
  - (A0,A0): both get 2. If P2 deviates to A1, gets 3 > 2 → so not an equilibrium.
  - (A0,A1): P2 gets 0; if P2 switches to A1, gets 1 > 0 → not NE.
  - (A1,A0): P1 gets 0; if P1 switches to A1, gets 1 > 0 → not NE.

So **only pure NE is (A1,A1)**.

But the **(A0,A0)** outcome gives higher total payoff: 4 vs 2.

So this game is **strategically interesting** — it has a **coordination incentive (A0,A0)** (Pareto superior), but **a dominant strategy to play A1** in a sense.

Wait — let's check dominant strategies:

For **you (Player 2)**:
- If P1 plays A0: your best response is A1 (3 > 2)
- If P1 plays A1: your best response is A1 (1 > 0)

→ **A1 is strictly dominant for you!**

Similarly, for Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1’s best is A1 (3 > 2)
- If P2 plays A1: P1’s best is A1 (1 > 0)

→ **A1 is strictly dominant for both players.**

So the **unique dominant strategy equilibrium is (A1, A1)** → payoff (1,1).

But it's inefficient: (2,2) is better for both.

Hence, this game is a **Prisoner’s Dilemma variant** — mutually beneficial cooperation (A0,A0), but each has an incentive to defect (play A1), and mutual defection is the Nash equilibrium.

---

### **Step 2: Goal - Maximize Your Own Total Points**

You want to **maximize your own expected payoff over many rounds** (though we assume **one round**, but you can design a contract to influence the outcome).

The **contract** is an **additional** payment you can propose to **both players**.

Key rules:
- You propose a contract: for each action (A0, A1), specify an extra amount (integer).
- The contract is **only active if both players accept**.
- The other player also proposes a contract — and **only one contract will be selected**, via **approval voting**.
- **Winning contract** is chosen uniformly at random among those with **maximum approvals**.

So, you want to design a contract that:
1. Makes you **want to accept** it (if you’re the only one), but more importantly,
2. **Induces the other player to also accept** it,
3. And **maximizes your expected payoff**, whether the contract is accepted or not — but **you can only get the contract’s benefit if both accept**.

---

### **Step 3: Strategy Design – Incentivize Cooperation**

In the base game, both players **want to play A1** due to dominance, leading to a bad outcome (1,1).

But if **both players could coordinate on (A0,A0)**, you’d get **2 points** instead of 1.

So, you want to **nudge the game toward (A0,A0)**.

But how?

You can **design a contract** that:
- Pays you **more if you play A0**, or
- Taxes you for playing A1, or
- Creates mutual incentives.

But remember: **you need the other player to accept your contract**.

So your contract must be **something the other player finds acceptable or beneficial** — even if they don’t trust you.

---

### **Step 4: Possible Contract Design**

Let’s suppose you propose a contract:

- If you play A0: +X for you, -X from the other
- If you play A1: +Y for you, -Y from the other

But the contract is **applied only if both players accept it**.

So the **effective payoff** becomes:

For Player 2 (you):

- If you play A0, other plays A0: 2 + X
- If you play A0, other plays A1: 0 + X
- If you play A1, other plays A0: 3 + Y
- If you play A1, other plays A1: 1 + Y

Similarly for other player.

You want to **make (A0, A0)** more attractive than (A1, A1) **in both players’ eyes**, so that both will want to play A0 **if the contract is in place**.

But the problem: if both players are rational, they might only accept the contract **if it benefits them**.

So, we need your contract to be **attractive to the other player**.

Let’s suppose you propose:

**Your contract:**
- A0: +1 (you get +1 if you play A0, other pays 1)
- A1: 0 (no extra)

So: if you play A0, you gain 1 point, the other loses 1 → you take a penalty from them.
If you play A1, no extra.

Now, what happens if the contract is in effect?

For **you (Player 2)**:
- A0 → if P1 plays A0: 2 + 1 = 3
  - if P1 plays A1: 0 + 1 = 1
- A1 → if P1 plays A0: 3 + 0 = 3
  - if P1 plays A1: 1 + 0 = 1

So **your best response to A0 is both A0 and A1 give 3** → indifferent.
**To A1**: both give 1 → indifferent.

But **your payoff depends on P1’s move**.

Let’s now look at **other player’s incentives**.

For **Player 1**:
- If they play A0:
  - You play A0: they get 2 - 1 = 1 (because you get +1, so you take 1 from them)
  - You play A1: they get 3 - 0 = 3
- If they play A1:
  - You play A0: they get 0 - 1 = -1
  - You play A1: they get 1 - 0 = 1

So, Player 1’s payoff:
- If they play A0: get 1 or 3 → best to play A1 if they expect you to play A1 → but if they expect you to play A0, they get 1 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → so better to play A0.

So their best response depends on your play.

But suppose they think you’ll play A0:
- Their best response: A0 → 1 vs -1 → so A0

If they think you’ll play A1:
- Their best response: A1 → 3 vs 1 → so A1

So if they expect you to play A0, they want to play A0 → leads to (A0,A0): you get 3, they get 1

But if they expect you to play A1, they play A1 — (A1,A1): you get 1, they get 1

But now: for **you**, if you play A0, you get 3 if they play A0, or 1 if they play A1.

If you play A1, you get 3 if they play A0, or 1 if they play A1.

So you are **indifferent between A0 and A1**, as long as the other plays the same.

But you **prefer** when the other plays A0 because it gives you 3 either way.

But you don’t control their play.

But if **they think you play A0**, they will play A0 → outcome (A0,A0) → both get 3 (you) and 1 (they)

If **they think you play A1**, they play A1 → (A1,A1) → both get 1

So both players can coordinate on (A0,A0) **if they both believe the other will play A0**.

But for **Player 1 to accept the contract**, they must get **at least as much as they would otherwise**, or better.

In the base game, with no contract, the NE is (A1,A1): both get 1.

So in the contract, if they play A0, they get only 1 (in (A0,A0)) — same as before.

But if they play A1, they get 1 too — so same.

But in (A0,A0), they get 1; in (A1,A1), they get 1 — so same.

But in (A1,A0): they get 3 → good, but that only happens if they play A1 and you play A0.

But **you play A0 only if it’s better for you**.

But you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

So **no incentive to coordinate**.

But wait — **in (A0,A0)**, you get 3, they get 1 → so you are better off, they are not.

So **they might reject this contract** — because it gives them no better payoff than the base game.

They get 1 in both cases, and **could be worse** if you deviate.

So they have **no incentive to accept** this contract.

We need to make your contract **more attractive to the other player**.

---

### **Step 5: Make It Symmetric or Mutual Incentive**

Idea: **make both players better off** in (A0,A0) than in (A1,A1), **and** make (A0,A0) the only equilibrium.

Let’s try a **symmetric contract**.

Suppose:

- A0: +1 for you
- A1: -1 for you → you pay 1 if you play A1

This penalizes (A1), rewards (A0), but **you pay when you play A1**.

But does it help?

Let’s check payoffs under contract:

Your payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 2 + 1 = 3
- (A0,A1): 0 + 1 = 1
- (A1,A0): 3 - 1 = 2
- (A1,A1): 1 - 1 = 0

Other player’s payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 2 + 1 = 3
- (A0,A1): 3 - 1 = 2 (if they play A1, you pay 1 to them? Wait)

Wait — the contract applies **per action**.

The rule says:

> A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating:
> - Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
> - Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
> - Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.

So **if you play A0, you get +1, and the other player pays you $1**.

If you play A1, you pay $1, and the other player gets $1.

So, under your contract:
- You: A0 → +1; A1 → -1
- Other player: A0 → -1; A1 → +1

Now, compute joint payoffs.

**Case 1: (A0, A0)**  
- You: 2 + 1 = 3  
- Other: 2 - 1 = 1  

**Case 2: (A0, A1)**  
- You: 0 + 1 = 1  
- Other: 3 + 1 = 4  

**Case 3: (A1, A0)**  
- You: 3 - 1 = 2  
- Other: 0 - 1 = -1  

**Case 4: (A1, A1)**  
- You: 1 - 1 = 0  
- Other: 1 + 1 = 2  

Now, let’s check **incentives**.

For **you (Player 2)**:
- If other plays A0: you get 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: you get 1 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefer A0

→ **A0 is strictly dominant** for you!

For **other player (Player 1)**:
- If you play A0: they get 1 (if they play A0) vs -1 (if they play A1) → prefer A0
- If you play A1: they get 4 (if they play A1) vs 2 (if they play A0) → prefer A1

→ **No dominant strategy**: depends on your play.

But now: **you play A0 with certainty** (due to dominance).

Then other player, facing you playing A0, gets:
- A0: 1
- A1: -1 → so prefers A0

So **(A0, A0)** is the unique Nash equilibrium under the contract.

And **payoff** is: you get 3, other gets 1.

But **is the other player willing to accept this contract?**

In the base game, (A1,A1) gives them 1.

Here, if they accept your contract, and both play A0 (which is equilibrium), they get **1**, same as base.

But if they deviate to A1, they get -1 → worse.

So they get **at least as much as before**, and **no risk of getting less**.

But they **could get more** — in (A0,A1), they get 4, but that only happens if you play A0 and they play A1 — but you won’t, since A0 is dominant.

So they **get exactly 1**, same as base.

So **they are indifferent** — no worse off.

But they are **not strictly better**.

In approval voting, if the other player is rational, they might **accept** contracts that are not worse, especially if you are proposing it.

But they might **reject** if they think: "I get 1 either way; why accept a contract that makes me worse if I deviate?"

But here, deviation **does** make them worse, so it's safer.

But if they expect you to play A0, they have no incentive to deviate — so they are fine.

But now: **is this contract better for YOU?**

Yes: under contract, you get 3 (in (A0,A0)) vs 1 in base (A1,A1).

So you gain.

But the **other player might not accept** if they get **only 1**, same as base.

But since they get **no worse**, and **no risk**, they might still accept.

But we can **do better**.

---

### **Step 6: Make it Mutually Better**

Can we make **both players** better off than base?

In base: (A1,A1) → (1,1)

We want to achieve (A0,A0) → (2,2) in base, but with contract, we can make it (3,3) or similar.

But you can't make **both** players better off **if you are adding a transfer**.

But we can **share the surplus**.

Let’s suppose you propose:

- A0: +2 (you get +2 if you play A0)
- A1: -1 (you pay 1 if you play A1)

But now:
- You: A0 → +2; A1 → -1
- Other player: A0 → -2; A1 → +1

Now payoffs:

**Case 1: (A0,A0)**  
- You: 2 + 2 = 4  
- Other: 2 - 2 = 0

**Case 2: (A0,A1)**  
- You: 0 + 2 = 2  
- Other: 3 + 1 = 4

**Case 3: (A1,A0)**  
- You: 3 - 1 = 2  
- Other: 0 - 2 = -2

**Case 4: (A1,A1)**  
- You: 1 - 1 = 0  
- Other: 1 + 1 = 2

Now:
- Your best response: A0 always (3 > 2, 2 > 0)
- Other’s best response: depends on your play
  - If you play A0: they get 0 (A0) vs -2 (A1) → prefer A0
  - If you play A1: they get 4 (A1) vs 2 (A0) → prefer A1
- But since you play A0, they play A0 → outcome (A0,A0): payoffs (4,0)

You get 4, they get 0 → worse for them.

So they **will reject** this contract — they get 0, worse than 1 in base.

So **not acceptable**.

We need a **symmetric contract** that **gives both players more than 1**, ideally.

But you can't give both more unless you **don't transfer money** — but you have to use the transfer mechanism.

Another idea: **both players receive a bonus for playing A0**, and pay for A1 — but **shared symmetrically**.

Propose:

- A0: +1 for you
- A1: +1 for you → no, that rewards A1.

Wait — we want to **reward A0**, penalize A1.

But we can only give **you** a contract that specifies your own payoffs.

But the other player’s contract is separate.

We are **only designing your contract**, hoping it is approved.

We want the **other player to accept it**.

Best way: **make sure they get at least as much as they would in base game**, and **prefer to accept**.

So **if they get 1 or more in the contract**, they are not worse off.

But they might get less.

So we need to **ensure that in the equilibrium outcome**, they get at least 1.

But in (A0,A0), they get base 2 in original, but if they are punished when they play A0 (because you get +X), then they might get less.

So to **protect the other player**, we must **not penalize them when they play A0**.

Wait — can you **only transfer to/from yourself**?

The rule says:

> "the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s)" → so if you receive +X, other player(s) pay X.

So when **you play A0**, you get +X, other player pays X.

So **other player is penalized** when you play A0.

But they are expected to play A0 to avoid worse outcomes.

But they might dislike that.

So to **make the contract palatable**, you need to **make sure that even if they are penalized**, they still end up with at least 1.

Alternatively, **make the penalty small** or **reward when they play A0**.

But you can only specify **your own** extra payoff.

So you cannot **directly reward them**.

But you **do** indirectly: if you play A0, they pay you → they are worse off.

So **to make the contract attractive to them**, you need to **reduce** that penalty.

Best: **avoid penalizing them when they play A0**.

But how?

Only way: **don’t get +X when you play A0** → but then you don’t get the incentive.

Alternative: **make the contract symmetric** and **mutually beneficial**.

Suppose you propose:

- A0: +1
- A1: +1

→ you get +1 no matter what. But then the other player must pay you 1 in every case.

Then you get at least 1 extra, they get -1 extra.

So they lose 1 in every case — they would **never accept**.

Worse.

Suppose you propose:

- A0: -1 (you pay 1 if you play A0)
- A1: -1 (you pay 1 if you play A1)

→ you pay 1 no matter what. Then other player gets +1 no matter what.

Then you get less, they get more — they would accept, but you lose.

Bad for you.

So best is to punish **only A1**, reward **A0**, but **not too much**.

Back to earlier idea:

**Try: A0: +1, A1: 0**

So you gain 1 for playing A0, nothing for A1.

Then:
- Other player: A0: -1, A1: 0

Now, payoffs:

**(A0,A0)**: you: 2+1=3, other: 2-1=1  
**(A0,A1)**: you: 0+1=1, other: 3+0=3  
**(A1,A0)**: you: 3+0=3, other: 0-1= -1  
**(A1,A1)**: you: 1+0=1, other: 1+0=1

Your best response:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 3, A1 gives 3 → indifferent
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 1, A1 gives 1 → indifferent

So no dominance.

But if you play A0, and other plays A0 → you get 3
If you play A1, and other plays A1 → you get 1

But you get 3 or 1 — so you prefer (A0,A0)

But other player:
- If you play A0: they get 1 (if they play A0) vs -1 (if A1) → prefer A0
- If you play A1: they get 3 (if A1) vs 1 (if A0) → prefer A1

So if they expect you to play A0, they play A0 → outcome (A0,A0): payoffs (3,1)
If they expect you to play A1, they play A1 → outcome (A1,A1): (1,1)

So both can coordinate on (A0,A0) if they trust each other.

But **in (A0,A0), they get 1**, same as base.

In (A1,A1), they get 1.

But if they play A1 when you play A0, they get -1 → worse.

So if they believe you will play A0, they will play A0.

But you are indifferent, so you might play A0 or A1.

But your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 3 if other A0, 1 if other A1
- If you play A1: 3 if other A0, 1 if other A1

Same.

But suppose you **commit to A0** → then other player, seeing you play A0, should play A0.

But you don't know.

But the contract is the **only thing making it better**.

But for **approval**: other player gets 1 in (A0,A0), 1 in (A1,A1), -1 in (A1,A0) → so they get at least 1 if both play A0 or both play A1.

But they are **not better off** than base.

But in base, they get 1 in NE.

So same.

They might accept.

But you can do better.

What if you propose:

- A0: +2
- A1: 0

Then:
- (A0,A0): you: 4, other: 0
- (A0,A1): you: 2, other: 3
- (A1,A0): you: 3, other: -2
- (A1,A1): you: 1, other: 1

Now other player gets 0 in (A0,A0), which is worse than 1 in base.

So they will reject.

So the **maximum you can give yourself for A0** without making them worse is **1**.

But let’s try a **different contract**: **A0: 0, A1: -1**

So no reward for A0, but you pay 1 if you play A1.

Then:
- You: A0: 0, A1: -1
- Other: A0: 0, A1: +1

Payoffs:

**(A0,A0)**: you: 2+0=2, other: 2+0=2  
**(A0,A1)**: you: 0+0=0, other: 3+1=4  
**(A1,A0)**: you: 3-1=2, other: 0+0=0  
**(A1,A1)**: you: 1-1=0, other: 1+1=2

Now:
- Your incentive:
  - If other plays A0: you get 2 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → indifferent
  - If other plays A1: you get 0 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → indifferent
  - But if you play A0, you get 2 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1
  - If you play A1, you get 2 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1

So you are indifferent.

But if you both play A0: you get 2, other gets 2 → better than base (1,1)

But only if they play A0.

Other player:
- If you play A0: they get 2 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefer A0
- If you play A1: they get 4 (A1) vs 2 (A0) → prefer A1

So if they believe you play A0, they play A0 → (A0,A0): (2,2)

If they believe you play A1, they play A1 → (A1,A1): (0,2) — wait, you get 0, they get 2

But you get 0, worse than 1.

So you might not want to play A1.

But you are indifferent, so you might play A0.

And if you do, they play A0.

So (A0,A0) is equilibrium, and both get 2 > 1.

Now, for the other player: in (A0,A0), they get 2 > 1, so they are **better off**.

You get 2 > 1 — you are also better off.

And this is **the only equilibrium** that is stable: if you play A0, they play A0; if they play A0, you are indifferent, so they can play A0.

So you can coordinate on (A0,A0).

And it’s **strictly better for both**.

Now, **will they accept the contract?**

- They get 2 in (A0,A0), which is better than base 1
- If they deviate to A1 while you play A0, they get 0 — worse
- So no incentive to deviate
- And they gain from the contract

So **they will definitely accept**.

You get 2 > 1 — so you gain.

Also, in the base game, they might not coordinate — they play A1.

But here, the contract makes (A0,A0) an equilibrium and better for both.

Perfect.

Moreover, the contract is:  
- A0: 0 (you get no extra for playing A0)  
- A1: -1 (you pay 1 if you play A1)

This **penalizes A1** for you, **rewarding A0**, but indirectly benefits both.

You pay only if you play A1, which you won't want to do.

Other player is **better off**.

So this contract is **mutually beneficial** and **induces cooperation**.

And it is accepted.

So this is great.

But is there a better one?

You could do:

- A0: 0, A1: -2

Then you pay 2 for A1.

Then (A0,A0): you get 2, other gets 2  
(A0,A1): you get 0, other gets 3 +1 =4 (because other gets +2 if they play A1? Wait no)

Wait: the other player gets +X only if they play A1.

In your contract:
- A0: 0 → you get 0, other gets 0
- A1: -2 → you get -2, other gets +2

So (A1,A1): you: 1-2 = -1, other: 1+2 =3

But then you might not want to play A1.

But in (A0,A0), you get 2, other gets 2.

But if other plays A1, you get 0 (A0) or -1 (A1), so worst.

But they get 3 if they play A1 and you play A0.

But you won't play A0 if you know they play A1.

But if they believe you play A0, they play A1 and get 3.

But you will only play A0 if they play A0 — but they will deviate.

So equilibrium breaks.

So better to use **smaller penalty**.

With A1: -1, penalty is small, but enough to make you prefer A0 if other plays A0.

Actually, with A1: -1, you are indifferent between A0 and A1 when other plays A0 or A1.

But since (A0,A0) gives you 2, better than any other outcome, you want to avoid (A1,A1) or (A1,A0).

But since you are indifferent, but the contract makes (A0,A0) better for both, and no worse for anyone, it works.

And the other player is better off.

So this is **ideal**.

Can you make it even better for you?

Suppose:

- A0: +0.5 → but must be integer.

So only integers.

Try A0: 0, A1: -1 → best.

Or A0: -1, A1: 0?

Then you pay if you play A0, get nothing for A1.

Then you want to play A1.

Other player: if you play A0, they get +1; if you play A1, they get 0.

So you will play A1 → they get 0 in (A1,A1), or 0 in (A1,A0), so they get 0 or 1.

They get 1 only if you play A0.

But you won't.

So they get 0 in (A1,A1) → worse than 1.

Not good.

So only good option is to **penalize A1**, not A0.

So A0: 0, A1: -1 is the best.

Now, can you add a small reward for A0?

Try A0: 0, A1: -1 → works.

Try A0: 1, A1: -1

Then:
- You: A0: 2+1=3; A1: 1-1=0
- Other: A0: 2-1=1; A1: 1+1=2

Now:
- If other plays A0: you get 3 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: you get 1 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefer A0
- So A0 is dominant for you.

Other player:
- If you play A0: they get 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefer A1? Wait
  - If you play A0, they get 1 if they play A0, 2 if they play A1 → prefer A1
- If you play A1: they get 1-1=0 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefer A1

So A1 is dominant for them.

So both play A1 → (A1,A1): you get 0, they get 2

But you get 0 < 1 in base → worse for you.

So no.

Therefore, **A0: 0, A1: -1** is best.

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

The best contract is:
- A0: 0 (no extra for playing A0)
- A1: -1 (you pay 1 if you play A1)

This:
- Makes (A0,A0) a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium
- Gives you 2 points (vs 1 in base)
- Gives the other player 2 points (vs 1 in base)
- They are strictly better off → will accept
- You are better off

And it’s simple, symmetric, and effective.

response:
To decide which contracts to approve, we need to evaluate each contract based on its impact on our potential points, while also considering the possibility of the other player’s actions and their points.

Let's first outline the base game without any contracts:

Payoff Matrix Without Any Contract:
- If both choose A0: P2 (You) get 2 points, P1 gets 2 points.
- If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1: P2 gets 0 points, P1 gets 3 points.
- If P2 chooses A1 and P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 3 points, P1 gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: P2 gets 1 point, P1 gets 1 point.

Next, let's evaluate the proposed contracts:

### Contract 1 proposed by Player 1
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 2 additional points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

**Adjusted Payoff Matrix with Contract 1:**
- If both choose A0: P2 gets 4 points (2 base + 2 bonus), P1 gets 4 points (2 base + 2 bonus).
- If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1: P2 gets -2 points (0 base - 2 deduction), P1 gets 5 points (3 base + 2 bonus).
- If P2 chooses A1 and P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 5 points (3 base + 2 deduction from P1), P1 gets -2 points (0 base).
- If both choose A1: P2 gets 1 point (1 base), P1 gets 1 point (1 base).

This contract seems to favor P1 when P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1, while P2 benefits when choosing A1 and P1 chooses A0.

### Contract 2 proposed by Player 2
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 1 additional point drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point distributed equally to the other player.

**Adjusted Payoff Matrix with Contract 2:**
- If both choose A0: P2 gets 3 points (2 base + 1 bonus), P1 gets 3 points (2 base + 1 bonus).
- If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1: P2 gets 0 points (0 base + 1 bonus - 1 from P1), P1 gets 4 points (3 base + 1 deduction from P2).
- If P2 chooses A1 and P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 4 points (3 base + 1 deduction from P1), P1 gets 0 points (0 base - 1 payment).
- If both choose A1: P2 gets 0 points (1 base - 1 payment), P1 gets 0 points (1 base - 1 payment).

This contract evenly spreads the balance, making the game more balanced and ensuring less extreme outcomes.

### Analysis:
- Contract 1 seems to highly favor extremes, especially benefitting P1 if they trick P2 into choosing A0 while they choose A1.
- Contract 2 seems to moderate the game making it fairer and ensuring players don’t stray into high negative values.

### Final Decision:
Approving Contract 2 is in our best interest as it moderates the outcomes and ensures a fairer distribution of points. We should disapprove of Contract 1 for its potential unfair advantages.

response:
To maximize our total points, let’s analyze the provided game and the proposed contracts step by step.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The basic payoffs are structured like a classic Prisoner's Dilemma:
- **(A0, A0):** 2, 2
- **(A0, A1):** 0, 3
- **(A1, A0):** 3, 0
- **(A1, A1):** 1, 1

In this setup, action **A1** is the dominant strategy for both players. If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 3 by playing A1 versus 2 by playing A0. If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 1 by playing A1 versus 0 by playing A0. Thus, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in **1 point** for each player.

### 2. Analysis of the Contracts (C1 & C2)
Both C1 and C2 are identical. They state that if a player chooses **A0**, they receive 2 points from the other player.
Let’s re-calculate the payoff matrix with this contract active:
- **(A0, A0):** Each player gives 2 points and receives 2 points.
  - Player 1: $2 (\text{original}) + 2 (\text{from P2}) - 2 (\text{to P2}) = 2$
  - Player 2: $2 (\text{original}) + 2 (\text{from P1}) - 2 (\text{to P1}) = 2$
  - Result: **(2, 2)**
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 gives 0 points and receives 2; Player 2 gives 2 points and receives 0.
  - Player 1: $0 (\text{original}) + 2 (\text{from P2}) = 2$
  - Player 2: $3 (\text{original}) - 2 (\text{to P1}) = 1$
  - Result: **(2, 1)**
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 gives 2 points and receives 0; Player 2 gives 0 points and receives 2.
  - Player 1: $3 (\text{original}) - 2 (\text{to P2}) = 1$
  - Player 2: $0 (\text{original}) + 2 (\text{from P1}) = 2$
  - Result: **(1, 2)**
- **(A1, A1):** No additional payments.
  - Player 1: $1 (\text{original}) = 1$
  - Player 2: $1 (\text{original}) = 1$
  - Result: **(1, 1)**

### 3. Strategy with the Contract
In this modified matrix, action **A0** becomes the dominant strategy for both players.
- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 2 (A0) > 1 (A1).
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 2 (A0) > 1 (A1).
Thus, both players will choose A0, resulting in a stable equilibrium of **2 points** for each player.

### 4. Comparison and Decision
- **Without a contract:** The likely outcome is 1 point (A1, A1).
- **With C1 or C2:** The likely outcome is 2 points (A0, A0).

Since 2 points is better than 1 point, and both contracts are identical and beneficial to Player 1, Player 1 should approve both contracts to increase the probability that at least one of them wins the approval process.

response:
Step 1: Start from the original game (no contract)  
For Player 2, compare A0 vs A1 against either action by Player 1:

- If P1 plays A0:  
  - P2(A0) = 2  
  - P2(A1) = 3  → A1 better
- If P1 plays A1:  
  - P2(A0) = 0  
  - P2(A1) = 1  → A1 better

So A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players, implying the unique equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoff 1 for me.

---

Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (A0 gets +2 from the other player; A1 gets 0)  
Net transfer effects:
- If both play A0, each pays 2 and receives 2 → net 0 transfer each.
- If I play A0 and P1 plays A1: I receive +2.
- If I play A1 and P1 plays A0: I pay 2 (i.e., -2).

My resulting payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 2 + 0 = 2
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 = 2
- (A1, A0): 3 − 2 = 1
- (A1, A1): 1 + 0 = 1

Now A0 strictly dominates A1, so equilibrium becomes (A0, A0) and my payoff is 2 (better than 1).  
So I approve C1.

---

Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (A0 gets +1 from other; A1 pays 1 to other)  
Net transfer effects:
- If both play A0: net 0 (each pays 1 and receives 1).
- If I play A0 and P1 plays A1: I receive +1 (for my A0) and also receive +1 (because P1 pays for A1) → net +2.
- If I play A1 and P1 plays A0: I pay 1 (for my A1) and also pay 1 (because P1 receives for A0) → net −2.
- If both play A1: net 0 (each pays 1 and receives 1).

This produces the same payoff matrix for me as C1:
- (A0, A0): 2
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A0): 1
- (A1, A1): 1

So again A0 strictly dominates, equilibrium (A0, A0), my payoff 2.  
So I approve C2.

To determine the best course of action, we first analyze the payoff matrix of the original game:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 | A1 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **A0** | (2, 2) | (0, 3) |
| **A1** | (3, 0) | (1, 1) |

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma. The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), where each player receives **1 point**.

### Evaluating Contract 1 (C1)
C1 specifies that any player choosing A0 receives 2 points from the other player.
- (A0, A0): Both play A0. Each receives 2 points. Player 1 receives 2 from Player 2, and Player 2 receives 2 from Player 1. Net change is 0. Final: **(2, 2)**.
- (A0, A1): Player 1 plays A0 and receives 2 points from Player 2. Final: (0+2, 3-2) = **(2, 1)**.
- (A1, A0): Player 2 plays A0 and receives 2 points from Player 1. Final: (3-2, 0+2) = **(1, 2)**.
- (A1, A1): No one plays A0. Final: **(1, 1)**.

In C1, A0 is a dominant strategy for both players (2 > 1). The Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), yielding 2 points for Player 1.

### Evaluating Contract 2 (C2)
C2 specifies that any player choosing A1 pays 2 points to the other player.
- (A0, A0): No one plays A1. Final: **(2, 2)**.
- (A0, A1): Player 2 plays A1 and pays 2 points to Player 1. Final: (0+2, 3-2) = **(2, 1)**.
- (A1, A0): Player 1 plays A1 and pays 2 points to Player 2. Final: (3-2, 0+2) = **(1, 2)**.
- (A1, A1): Both play A1. Each pays 2 and receives 2. Net change is 0. Final: **(1, 1)**.

In C2, A0 is also a dominant strategy for both players (2 > 1). The Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), yielding 2 points for Player 1.

### Comparison and Decision
Both contracts transform the game from a Prisoner's Dilemma into a Coordination Game where the socially optimal outcome (A0, A0) becomes the Nash Equilibrium. In both cases, Player 1 expects to receive 2 points, which is better than the 1 point expected in the original game. Since both contracts result in identical transformed payoff matrices and outcomes, Player 1 should approve both to maximize the likelihood that a contract is implemented.

The task is to decide which proposed contracts to approve. To make an informed decision, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and then evaluate how each contract affects the game's incentives and outcomes.

### Original Payoff Matrix (Prisoner's Dilemma):
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

In the original game, A1 is the dominant strategy for both players, leading to a Nash Equilibrium of (1, 1). However, both players would prefer the (2, 2) outcome of (A0, A0).

### Evaluation of Contracts:
Both **Contract 1 (C1)** and **Contract 2 (C2)** are identical:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 2 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, no payment occurs.

#### Payoff Matrix under C1 or C2:
- **(A0, A0):** Original (2, 2). Player 1 gets +2 from P2 and gives -2 to P2. Player 2 gets +2 from P1 and gives -2 to P1. Net: **(2, 2)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Original (0, 3). Player 1 chooses A0, so P1 receives +2 from P2. Player 2 chooses A1 (no change). Net: (0+2, 3-2) = **(2, 1)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Original (3, 0). Player 1 chooses A1 (no change). Player 2 chooses A0, so P2 receives +2 from P1. Net: (3-2, 0+2) = **(1, 2)**.
- **(A1, A1):** Original (1, 1). No payments occur. Net: **(1, 1)**.

#### Strategy Analysis with Contracts:
Under either contract, Player 1's incentives change:
- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 2 points with A0 versus 1 point with A1.
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 2 points with A0 versus 1 point with A1.

A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both players. This results in a Nash Equilibrium of **(2, 2)**, which is significantly better than the original Nash Equilibrium of **(1, 1)**.

### Conclusion:
Since both contracts effectively solve the Prisoner's Dilemma by making cooperation (A0) the dominant strategy, they are beneficial for maximizing total points. Approving both ensures that if Player 2 also approves them, one of these beneficial contracts will be implemented.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
To maximize the points received in this decision-making game, we first analyze the base game and the impact of the proposed contracts.

### 1. Base Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for the original game (P1, P2) is:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

This is a classic **Prisoner's Dilemma**. If both players are rational, they will analyze their dominant strategies:
- For Player 2: If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets more from A1 (3 vs 2). If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 gets more from A1 (1 vs 0).
- Dominant strategy for both: **A1**.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** (A1, A1), resulting in **1 point** for each player.

### 2. Contract Analysis (C1 and C2)
Both proposed contracts are identical:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +2 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, no payment.

Let's calculate the revised payoff matrix under this contract:
- **(A0, A0):** Player 1 receives +2 and pays -2. Player 2 receives +2 and pays -2.
  Total: (2 + 2 - 2, 2 + 2 - 2) = **(2, 2)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 receives +2 and pays 0. Player 2 receives 0 and pays -2.
  Total: (0 + 2, 3 - 2) = **(2, 1)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 receives 0 and pays -2. Player 2 receives +2 and pays 0.
  Total: (3 - 2, 0 + 2) = **(1, 2)**.
- **(A1, A1):** No additional payments.
  Total: **(1, 1)**.

### 3. Revised Game Strategy
In the revised matrix:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 2 from A0 and 1 from A1. Player 2 chooses A0.
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 2 from A0 and 1 from A1. Player 2 chooses A0.
- Dominant strategy for both: **A0**.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** (A0, A0), resulting in **2 points** for each player.

### 4. Comparison and Decision
- **Without a contract:** The expected outcome is 1 point.
- **With C1 or C2:** The expected outcome is 2 points.

Since both contracts result in a higher payoff than the base game and are identical in their mechanics, approving both ensures that a contract is selected, moving the equilibrium from (1, 1) to (2, 2).

response:
The game presented is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma. Let's analyze the payoffs for you (Player 2) and the other player (Player 1) based on the original rules:

1.  **Original Payoff Matrix (P1, P2):**
    *   (A0, A0): (2, 2)
    *   (A0, A1): (0, 3) — P1 chooses A0, you choose A1
    *   (A1, A0): (3, 0) — P1 chooses A1, you choose A0
    *   (A1, A1): (1, 1)

    In this matrix, the dominant strategy for both players is **A1** (since 3 > 2 and 1 > 0). The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in **1 point** for you.

2.  **Evaluating the Proposed Contracts (C1 and C2):**
    Both contracts are identical: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players." In a two-player game, this means if you choose A0, Player 1 pays you 2 points; if Player 1 chooses A0, you pay Player 1 2 points.

3.  **Modified Payoff Matrix under C1/C2 (P1, P2):**
    *   **(A0, A0):** Original (2, 2). Both play A0, so both receive 2 and pay 2. Result: **(2, 2)**.
    *   **(A0, A1):** Original (0, 3). P1 plays A0 (+2 points from P2). P2 plays A1 (no change). Result: (0+2, 3-2) = **(2, 1)**.
    *   **(A1, A0):** Original (3, 0). P1 plays A1 (no change). P2 plays A0 (+2 points from P1). Result: (3-2, 0+2) = **(1, 2)**.
    *   **(A1, A1):** Original (1, 1). No extra payments. Result: **(1, 1)**.

4.  **Analysis of the Contract Game:**
    Under these contracts:
    *   If Player 1 plays A0, you get 2 points with A0 and 1 point with A1. You prefer **A0**.
    *   If Player 1 plays A1, you get 2 points with A0 and 1 point with A1. You prefer **A0**.
    A0 becomes your dominant strategy. Similarly, A0 becomes Player 1's dominant strategy. The resulting Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), giving you **2 points**.

Since the implementation of either contract increases your payoff from 1 point to 2 points, it is in your best interest to approve both.

To maximize your total points in this game, we first analyze the original payoff structure. This is a standard Prisoner's Dilemma where:
- (A0, A0) produces (2, 2)
- (A0, A1) produces (0, 3)
- (A1, A0) produces (3, 0)
- (A1, A1) produces (1, 1)

In the original game, A1 is the dominant strategy for both players, leading to a Nash Equilibrium of (1, 1).

Next, we evaluate the proposed contracts:

**Contract 1 (C1):**
- A0 provides a +2 bonus drawn from the other player.
- If both play A0: Each receives a +2 bonus and pays a -2 penalty. Net payoff: 2 + 2 - 2 = 2.
- If one plays A0 and the other plays A1: The A0 player receives 0 + 2 = 2. The A1 player receives 3 - 2 = 1.
- If both play A1: No bonuses or payments are made. Net payoff: 1.
- **Payoff Matrix C1:** (A0, A0): (2, 2), (A0, A1): (2, 1), (A1, A0): (1, 2), (A1, A1): (1, 1).
- In this matrix, A0 is the dominant strategy (2 > 1), resulting in an equilibrium of (2, 2).

**Contract 2 (C2):**
- A0 provides a +1 bonus drawn from the other player, and A1 incurs a -1 penalty distributed to the other player.
- If both play A0: Each receives +1 and pays -1. Net payoff: 2 + 1 - 1 = 2.
- If one plays A0 (P1) and the other plays A1 (P2): P1 receives +1 (for choosing A0) and +1 (from P2's A1 penalty). Net payoff: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2. P2 pays -1 (for A1) and -1 (to P1 for their A0). Net payoff: 3 - 1 - 1 = 1.
- If both play A1: Each pays -1 and receives +1. Net payoff: 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
- **Payoff Matrix C2:** (A0, A0): (2, 2), (A0, A1): (2, 1), (A1, A0): (1, 2), (A1, A1): (1, 1).
- In this matrix, A0 is the dominant strategy (2 > 1), resulting in an equilibrium of (2, 2).

**Conclusion:**
Both contracts C1 and C2 transform the game from a Prisoner's Dilemma into a game where the cooperative action (A0) is the dominant strategy. Both contracts result in an equilibrium payoff of 2 points, which is superior to the 1 point received in the original game's equilibrium. Since both contracts result in the same beneficial outcome, you should approve both.

response:
Given the payoff structure of the base game (a classic Prisoner's Dilemma), both players' dominant strategy is to play A1, resulting in a (1, 1) outcome. Any contract that encourages coordination on A0 (the cooperative choice) would result in a better outcome for both players (2, 2).

Let's evaluate the proposed contracts:
- **Contract 1 (C1):** If a player chooses A0, they receive 2 points from the other player. This alters the payoff matrix to make A0 strictly dominant for both players (payoffs: (A0, A0)=2, (A0, A1)=2, (A1, A0)=1, (A1, A1)=1). With A0 as a dominant strategy, both players are incentivized to cooperate, leading to a stable (2, 2) outcome.
- **Contract 2 (C2):** If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point to the other player. This alters the payoff matrix to make both players indifferent between A0 and A1 (payoffs: (A0, A0)=2, (A0, A1)=1, (A1, A0)=2, (A1, A1)=1). While (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium and Pareto superior to (A1, A1), the lack of strict dominance makes the outcome less certain than in C1. 

Since your objective is to maximize your total points, C1 is the strongest available option as it guarantees a higher payoff (2) by making cooperation the dominant strategy. While C2 is better than the base game, C1 is superior in its ability to force the (2, 2) outcome. By approving only C1, you increase its chances of being selected over C2 or the no-contract scenario, ensuring the highest possible stable payoff.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
Sure, let's analyze the situation step by step:

### Original Payoff Matrix
Without the contract, the payoffs for each player are as follows:

- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 2 points, Player 1 gets 2 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 1 point, Player 1 gets 1 point.

### Payoff Matrix with Contract
The contract specifies additional payments or deductions:

- Choosing A0 gives an additional +1 point (deducted -1 points from the other player).
- Choosing A1 incurs a deduction of -1 point (transferred +1 point to the other player).

With the contract signed, the adjusted payoffs are:

- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Player 2: 2 (game) + 1 (contract) = 3 points
  - Player 1: 2 (game) + 1 (contract) = 3 points

- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Player 2: 0 (game) + 1 (contract) = 1 points
  - Player 1: 3 (game) - 1 (contract) = 2 points

- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Player 2: 3 (game) - 1 (contract) = 2 points
  - Player 1: 0 (game) + 1 (contract) = 1 points

- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Player 2: 1 (game) - 1 (contract) = 0 points
  - Player 1: 1 (game) - 1 (contract) = 0 points

### Analysis of Strategies

#### Without the Contract
Without the contract, the dominant strategy could be mixed or based on mutual cooperation to achieve higher joint payoffs. However, players could shift towards non-cooperative behavior:

- Nash Equilibrium in the original setting leans towards (A1, A1) giving both 1 point each.

#### With the Contract
The introduction of the contract incentivizes cooperative choices more, as the penalties and rewards shift:

- Both players choosing A0 results in a higher mutual payoff (3, 3). 
- (A0, A0) now becomes clearly more rewarding than (A1, A1) which results in (0, 0).

#### Conclusion: Sign or Not to Sign?
By signing the contract, both players are nudged towards cooperative behavior, with a new dominant strategy potentially being (A0, A0) giving higher payoffs of 3 points each. 

Therefore, signing the contract aligns with maximizing my total points.

### Final Answer

We will sign the contract. Hence:

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the payoffs of the game both with and without the contract.

### 1. Original Game Analysis (No Contract)
The base payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 are:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

This is a classic **Prisoner's Dilemma**. If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2's best response is A1 (3 > 2). If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2's best response is A1 (1 > 0). The same applies to Player 1. Therefore, the unique Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), where both players receive **1 point**.

### 2. Contracted Game Analysis
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn from the other player."

Let's calculate the new payoffs if the contract is signed by both players:
- **(A0, A0):**
  - Base: (2, 2)
  - P1 gains 2 from P2, but also gives 2 to P2 (because both chose A0).
  - Final: (2 + 2 - 2, 2 + 2 - 2) = **(2, 2)**
- **(A0, A1):**
  - Base: (0, 3)
  - P1 gains 2 from P2 for choosing A0.
  - Final: (0 + 2, 3 - 2) = **(2, 1)**
- **(A1, A0):**
  - Base: (3, 0)
  - P2 gains 2 from P1 for choosing A0.
  - Final: (3 - 2, 0 + 2) = **(1, 2)**
- **(A1, A1):**
  - Base: (1, 1)
  - No payments.
  - Final: **(1, 1)**

### 3. Comparison
In the contracted payoff matrix:
- If P2 chooses A0, P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1).
- If P2 chooses A1, P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1).
In the contracted game, **A0 becomes the dominant strategy** for both players. This leads to a Nash Equilibrium of (A0, A0), where both players earn **2 points**.

### 4. Decision
- **If the contract is not signed:** The game remains a Prisoner's Dilemma with an expected outcome of (1, 1).
- **If the contract is signed:** The game shifts to a cooperative structure with a dominant outcome of (2, 2).

Since 2 points is better than 1 point, and Player 1 (me) originally proposed this contract to improve the outcome, signing it is the most rational choice for maximizing total points.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the original game and then examine how the proposed contract changes the payoffs.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The original payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

This is a classic **Prisoner's Dilemma**. A1 is the dominant strategy for both players because playing A1 always results in a higher payoff than playing A0, regardless of what the other player chooses. Consequently, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), leading to a payoff of (1, 1).

### 2. Analysis of the Proposed Contract
The contract specifies:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +2 points and the other player pays -2 points.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no change.

If **both** players sign the contract, the new payoffs are calculated as follows:
- **(A0, A0):** (2 + 2 - 2, 2 + 2 - 2) = **(2, 2)**
- **(A0, A1):** (0 + 2 - 0, 3 - 2) = **(2, 1)**
- **(A1, A0):** (3 - 2, 0 + 2 - 0) = **(1, 2)**
- **(A1, A1):** (1 + 0 - 0, 1 + 0 - 0) = **(1, 1)**

### 3. Strategy with the Contract
In the modified payoff matrix (if the contract is signed):
- If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 2 points with A0 and 1 point with A1.
- If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 2 points with A0 and 1 point with A1.

In this scenario, **A0 becomes the dominant strategy**. Both players choosing A0 leads to a Nash Equilibrium of **(2, 2)**. 

### 4. Decision to Sign
The contract only activates if both players sign. 
- If you **Sign**: If the other player also signs, you shift the equilibrium from 1 point to 2 points. If the other player does not sign, the contract is void and the game stays at the original equilibrium (1 point).
- If you **Do Not Sign**: The contract is void regardless of the other player's choice, and the game stays at 1 point.

Since signing the contract allows the players to escape the Prisoner's Dilemma and achieve a higher payoff (2 points instead of 1), and since the contract was originally proposed by you (Player 1), it is clearly beneficial to sign.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the payoffs of the original game and how the contract modifies them.

### 1. Original Game Analysis
The original payoff matrix is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma:
- (A0, A0): 2, 2
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 1, 1

In this matrix, **A1 is the dominant strategy** for both players because:
- If the other player chooses A0, you get 3 points with A1 versus 2 with A0.
- If the other player chooses A1, you get 1 point with A1 versus 0 with A0.
The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), leading to **1 point** for each player.

### 2. Contract Analysis
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 2 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

Let's calculate the new payoff matrix if **both** players sign the contract:
- **(A0, A0):** Each player chooses A0, so each receives 2 points and pays 2 points. The net change is 0. Payoff: **(2, 2)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 and receives 2 points from Player 2. Payoffs: P1 gets $0 + 2 = 2$, P2 gets $3 - 2 = 1$. Payoff: **(2, 1)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 2 chooses A0 and receives 2 points from Player 1. Payoffs: P1 gets $3 - 2 = 1$, P2 gets $0 + 2 = 2$. Payoff: **(1, 2)**.
- **(A1, A1):** No one chooses A0, so there are no payments. Payoff: **(1, 1)**.

### 3. Contract Game Nash Equilibrium
In the modified matrix:
- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 prefers A0 (2 points) over A1 (1 point).
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 prefers A0 (2 points) over A1 (1 point).
**A0 is now the dominant strategy** for both players. The new Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), leading to **2 points** for each player.

### 4. Decision
- If you **sign** the contract:
  - If the other player also signs, the game shifts to the modified matrix, and you likely get **2 points**.
  - If the other player does not sign, the contract is inactive, and you are in the original game where you get **1 point**.
- If you **do not sign** the contract:
  - The contract is inactive, and you remain in the original game, receiving **1 point**.

Since signing the contract provides a potential increase in total points without any apparent downside compared to not signing (assuming rational play from the opponent), signing is the optimal choice.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game
Without any contract, this is a Prisoner's Dilemma where:
- My payoffs: (2,0,3,1) for outcomes (A0,A0), (A0,A1), (A1,A0), (A1,A1)
- A1 is the dominant strategy for both players
- Nash equilibrium: both play A1, getting 1 point each
- This is suboptimal compared to mutual A0 (2 points each)

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (proposed by Player 1)
With C1, players choosing A0 receive 2 points from the other player.

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 2 + 2 (I receive) - 2 (I pay) = **2 + 2 = 4**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 (I receive) = **2**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 (I pay) = **1**
- (A1, A1): 1 + 0 = **1**

Now A0 dominates A1 for both players! Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) with **4 points for me**.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (proposed by me)
With C2, players choosing A1 pay 2 points to the other player.

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): **2**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 (from opponent's penalty) = **2**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 (I pay penalty) = **1**
- (A1, A1): 1 - 2 (I pay) + 2 (I receive) = **1**

Now A0 dominates A1 for both players! Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) with **2 points for me**.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes
- No contract: 1 point
- Contract 1: 4 points ✓✓
- Contract 2: 2 points ✓

Both contracts are improvements, but C1 is strictly better for me.

## Step 5: Strategic voting consideration
Since C1 gives me 4 points and C2 gives me 2 points:
- I prefer C1 to win
- If I approve only C1, and Player 1 also approves C1 (which they should, as it gives them 4 too), C1 wins
- If I approve both C1 and C2, I risk creating a tie (if Player 1 also approves both), leading to random selection with expected value 3, which is worse than C1's guaranteed 4

**Optimal strategy:** Approve only C1 to maximize the probability it wins.

{"C1": true, "C2": false}

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the potential outcomes in both the original game and the contract-modified game.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The payoff matrix for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2, you) is:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

In this scenario, A1 is the dominant strategy for both players. For instance, if P1 chooses A0, P2 gets more points choosing A1 (3 vs 2). If P1 chooses A1, P2 also gets more points choosing A1 (1 vs 0). Both players, seeking to maximize their own points, will choose A1, leading to a Nash Equilibrium of (1, 1).

### 2. Analysis of the Contract-Modified Game
The contract specifies: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn from the other player." If both players sign, the new payoffs are:
- **(A0, A0):** Original (2, 2). P1 gets +2 (for A0) - 2 (for P2's A0) = 2. P2 gets +2 (for A0) - 2 (for P1's A0) = 2. Result: **(2, 2)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Original (0, 3). P1 gets +2 (for A0) - 0 = 2. P2 gets +0 - 2 (for P1's A0) = 1. Result: **(2, 1)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Original (3, 0). P1 gets +0 - 2 (for P2's A0) = 1. P2 gets +2 (for A0) - 0 = 2. Result: **(1, 2)**.
- **(A1, A1):** Original (1, 1). No extra payments. Result: **(1, 1)**.

In this modified game, A0 is now the dominant strategy for both players. If P1 chooses A0, P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1). If P1 chooses A1, P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1). Both players will choose A0, leading to a Nash Equilibrium of (2, 2).

### 3. Comparison and Decision
The contract becomes active only if both players sign it:
- **If you sign:** If Player 1 also signs, the new equilibrium is **(2, 2)**. If Player 1 does not sign, the original game is played, leading to **(1, 1)**.
- **If you do not sign:** The original game is played regardless, leading to **(1, 1)**.

Since Player 1 proposed this contract, they have expressed a clear intent to sign it. By signing as well, you transition the game from a Nash Equilibrium of 1 point to a Nash Equilibrium of 2 points. Even if Player 1 were to surprise you by not signing, you are no worse off than if you hadn't signed. Thus, signing the contract is the optimal move to maximize your points.

To maximize points, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and how the payment contract modifies it.

**Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

**Evaluating the Contract:**
The contract specifies:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 2 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, no payment occurs.

**Modified Payoff Matrix (after contract adjustments):**
1.  **(A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives 2 points from the other, and each loses 2 points to the other.
    - Player 1: 2 + 2 - 2 = 2 points
    - Player 2: 2 + 2 - 2 = 2 points
    - Result: (2, 2)
2.  **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1. Player 1 receives 2 points from Player 2.
    - Player 1: 0 + 2 = 2 points
    - Player 2: 3 - 2 = 1 point
    - Result: (2, 1)
3.  **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0. Player 2 receives 2 points from Player 1.
    - Player 1: 3 - 2 = 1 point
    - Player 2: 0 + 2 = 2 points
    - Result: (1, 2)
4.  **(A1, A1):** Neither player chooses A0. No adjustments are made.
    - Player 1: 1 point
    - Player 2: 1 point
    - Result: (1, 1)

**Strategic Analysis for Player 1:**
- If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 receives 2 points by choosing A0 and 1 point by choosing A1.
- If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 receives 2 points by choosing A0 and 1 point by choosing A1.

In both scenarios, choosing A0 results in a higher payoff for Player 1 (2 points) than choosing A1 (1 point). Choosing A0 is a strictly dominant strategy. By choosing A0 with 100% probability, Player 1 secures 2 points regardless of Player 2's decision.

1) Incorporate the contract as a transfer between the two players:
- If **you (Player 2)** choose **A0**, you get **+2**.
- If **Player 1** chooses **A0**, you (Player 2) pay **−2**.

2) Compute your (Player 2) modified payoffs for each outcome:

- (P1 A0, P2 A0): base 2 +2 (you chose A0) −2 (P1 chose A0) = **2**
- (P1 A1, P2 A0): base 0 +2 −0 = **2**
- (P1 A0, P2 A1): base 3 +0 −2 = **1**
- (P1 A1, P2 A1): base 1 +0 −0 = **1**

3) Best response:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 2 vs A1 gives 1 → **A0 better**
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 2 vs A1 gives 1 → **A0 better**

   | A1 ( P1) | 3, 0     | 1, 1     |
   ```

2. **Contract Proposed by Player 1:**
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

   Let's modify the payoff matrix to incorporate this:
   ```
   |      | A0 ( P2) | A1 ( P2) |
   |------|----------|----------|
   | A0 ( P1) | 4, 0     | 2, 1     |
   | A1 ( P1) | 1, 2     | 1, 1     |
   ```

   Explanation: 
   - (A0, A0): P1 gets +2 and P2 gets -2, making it (4-2, 2+2) -> (4, 0)
   - (A0, A1): P1 gets +2 and P2 gets -2, making it (0+2, 3-2) -> (2, 1)
   - (A1, A0): No change in payoffs: (3, 0) -> (1, 2)
   - (A1, A1): No change in payoffs: (1, 1)

   For me, Player 2, this contract is substantial because it reduces my payoff in most scenarios. Hence:
   - C1: false

3. **Contract Proposed by Player 2 (my proposal):**
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other player.

   Modify the payoff matrix:
   ```
   |      | A0 ( P2) | A1 ( P2) |
   |------|----------|----------|
   | A0 ( P1) | 3, 1     | 1, 2     |
   | A1 ( P1) | 2, 1     | 0, 0     |
   ```

   Explanation:
   - (A0, A0): P1 gets a +0.5 point boost and P2 gets a -0.5 point reduction: (2+1=3, 2-1=1)
   - (A0, A1): P2 receives a +0.5 point boost and P1 gets a -0.5 point reduction (0-1=1, 3+1=2)
   - (A1, A0): P1 gets a +0.5 point boost and P2 gets a -0.5 point reduction (3-1+1, 0-1+1)
   - (A1, A1): No change: (1, 1) -> (0, 0)

   For me, Player 2, this contract provides a balanced payoff structure. Hence:
   - C2: true

### Conclusion:

- C1: false (disadvantageous for Player 2)
- C2: true (advantageous for Player 2)

### JSON Object:
```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}
```

Thus, this is how you would determine the approval choices.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
To determine the best strategy, let's analyze the payoff matrix after incorporating the effects of the payment contract.

### 1. Identify the base payoffs:
- (A0, A0): Player 1 = 2, Player 2 = 2
- (A0, A1): Player 1 = 0, Player 2 = 3
- (A1, A0): Player 1 = 3, Player 2 = 0
- (A1, A1): Player 1 = 1, Player 2 = 1

### 2. Apply the contract adjustments:
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive **+2 points**, and the other player loses **2 points**.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

**Adjusted Payoffs:**
- **Scenario (A0, A0):**
    - Player 1: 2 (base) + 2 (choosing A0) - 2 (Player 2 choosing A0) = **2**
    - Player 2: 2 (base) + 2 (choosing A0) - 2 (Player 1 choosing A0) = **2**
- **Scenario (A0, A1):**
    - Player 1: 0 (base) + 2 (choosing A0) - 0 (Player 2 choosing A1) = **2**
    - Player 2: 3 (base) + 0 (choosing A1) - 2 (Player 1 choosing A0) = **1**
- **Scenario (A1, A0):**
    - Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 (choosing A1) - 2 (Player 2 choosing A0) = **1**
    - Player 2: 0 (base) + 2 (choosing A0) - 0 (Player 1 choosing A1) = **2**
- **Scenario (A1, A1):**
    - Player 1: 1 (base) + 0 = **1**
    - Player 2: 1 (base) + 0 = **1**

### 3. Analyze the new payoff matrix:
| | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2) | (2, 1) |
| **Player 1: A1** | (1, 2) | (1, 1) |

### 4. Determine the optimal strategy:
For Player 1:
- If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets **2** by choosing A0 and **1** by choosing A1.
- If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets **2** by choosing A0 and **1** by choosing A1.

In both cases, choosing **A0** results in a higher payoff (2 points) than choosing A1 (1 point). Thus, A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy**. Since Player 2 faces the same payoff structure, A0 is also their dominant strategy. 

To maximize total points received, the optimal move is to play A0 with 100% probability.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the game step by step.

### 1. Analyze the Original Game (Prisoner's Dilemma)
The original payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

In this scenario, A1 is the dominant strategy for both players. Regardless of what the other player chooses, choosing A1 provides a higher payoff (3 > 2 and 1 > 0). Therefore, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in 1 point for each player.

### 2. Analyze the Contract
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +2 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

Let's calculate the new payoffs if the contract is signed by both players:
- **Case (A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives 2 points. Additionally, Player 1 receives 2 points from Player 2, and Player 2 receives 2 points from Player 1.
  - P1: 2 + 2 - 2 = 2 points.
  - P2: 2 + 2 - 2 = 2 points.
- **Case (A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1. Player 1 receives 0 points (game) + 2 points (contract from P2). Player 2 receives 3 points (game) - 2 points (contract to P1).
  - P1: 0 + 2 = 2 points.
  - P2: 3 - 2 = 1 point.
- **Case (A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0. Player 1 receives 3 points (game) - 2 points (contract to P2). Player 2 receives 0 points (game) + 2 points (contract from P1).
  - P1: 3 - 2 = 1 point.
  - P2: 0 + 2 = 2 points.
- **Case (A1, A1):** No additional payments occur.
  - P1: 1 point.
  - P2: 1 point.

### 3. New Payoff Matrix (Contract Active)
The adjusted payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (2, 1)
- (A1, A0): (1, 2)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

In this modified game, **A0 becomes the dominant strategy** for both players. If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 2 points playing A0 vs 1 point playing A1. If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 2 points playing A0 vs 1 point playing A1. Thus, the Nash Equilibrium shifts to (A0, A0), and both players receive 2 points.

### 4. Decision
- **If I sign:** If the other player also signs, we move from a Nash Equilibrium of 1 point to a Nash Equilibrium of 2 points. If the other player does not sign, we stay at the original Nash Equilibrium of 1 point.
- **If I don't sign:** The contract cannot be activated, and we are guaranteed to remain at the original Nash Equilibrium of 1 point.

Since 2 points is better than 1 point, and there is no downside to signing (the contract only activates if both agree), the optimal decision is to sign.

To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the payoff matrix after incorporating the payment contract.

### 1. Identify the Base Payoffs (P1, P2):
*   (A0, A0): (2, 2)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 3)
*   (A1, A0): (3, 0)
*   (A1, A1): (1, 1)

### 2. Apply the Payment Contract:
The contract states:
*   If a player chooses A0, they receive +2 points, taken from the other player.
*   If a player chooses A1, no payment occurs.

**Scenario-by-scenario analysis:**
*   **If (A0, A0):**
    *   P1 receives 2 points for choosing A0 (from P2).
    *   P2 receives 2 points for choosing A0 (from P1).
    *   Net points for P1: 2 (base) + 2 (reward) - 2 (payment to P2) = **2**.
    *   Net points for P2: 2 (base) + 2 (reward) - 2 (payment to P1) = **2**.
*   **If (A0, A1):**
    *   P1 receives 2 points for choosing A0 (from P2).
    *   P2 chooses A1, so no reward or payment from P1.
    *   Net points for P1: 0 (base) + 2 (reward) = **2**.
    *   Net points for P2: 3 (base) - 2 (payment to P1) = **1**.
*   **If (A1, A0):**
    *   P1 chooses A1, so no reward or payment from P2.
    *   P2 receives 2 points for choosing A0 (from P1).
    *   Net points for P1: 3 (base) - 2 (payment to P2) = **1**.
    *   Net points for P2: 0 (base) + 2 (reward) = **2**.
*   **If (A1, A1):**
    *   Neither player chooses A0; no additional payments.
    *   Net points for P1: **1**.
    *   Net points for P2: **1**.

### 3. Revised Payoff Matrix (P1, P2):
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1: A0** | (2, 2) | (2, 1) |
| **P1: A1** | (1, 2) | (1, 1) |

### 4. Determine Strategy:
Looking at the revised matrix for Player 1:
*   If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets **2** points by choosing A0 and **1** point by choosing A1.
*   If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets **2** points by choosing A0 and **1** point by choosing A1.

In both cases, A0 yields a higher payoff (2 > 1). This makes A0 a strictly dominant strategy. The same logic applies to Player 2. Since A0 is the dominant strategy and results in the highest possible guaranteed score regardless of the opponent's action, the optimal decision is to choose A0 with 100% probability.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we must first analyze the original payoff structure and then incorporate the effects of the contract.

### 1. Original Payoff Matrix
The original payoffs for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (Me) are as follows:
- (P1: A0, P2: A0): P1 = 2, P2 = 2
- (P1: A1, P2: A0): P1 = 3, P2 = 0
- (P1: A0, P2: A1): P1 = 0, P2 = 3
- (P1: A1, P2: A1): P1 = 1, P2 = 1

In this original game, A1 is the dominant strategy for both players, leading to a Nash equilibrium of (1, 1).

### 2. Impact of the Contract
The contract specifies that if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points, drawn from the other player.
- If both choose A0: P1 and P2 both gain 2 and lose 2. Net change = 0.
- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: P1 receives 2 points from P2.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: P2 receives 2 points from P1.
- If both choose A1: No points are transferred.

### 3. Modified Payoff Matrix
Adjusting the original payoffs with the contract transfers:
- **(P1: A0, P2: A0):** (2+0, 2+0) = **(2, 2)**
- **(P1: A0, P2: A1):** (0+2, 3-2) = **(2, 1)**
- **(P1: A1, P2: A0):** (3-2, 0+2) = **(1, 2)**
- **(P1: A1, P2: A1):** (1, 1) = **(1, 1)**

### 4. Strategic Analysis
Now let's determine the best action for Player 2:
- If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 2 points for A0 and 1 point for A1. A0 is better.
- If Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 2 points for A0 and 1 point for A1. A0 is better.

For both players, choosing A0 is now the dominant strategy. The contract has successfully transformed a Prisoner's Dilemma—where both would likely defect (A1)—into a game where cooperation (A0) is the most profitable individual and collective decision.

By choosing A0 with 100% probability, you maximize your payoff given the legally binding contract.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
To maximize the points received, we analyze the game both with and without the proposed payment contract.

**Step 1: Analyze the original game (without the contract).**
The payoff matrix for the original game is:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)
In this game, Player 1's best response is always A1 (since 3 > 2 and 1 > 0), regardless of Player 2's choice. Similarly, Player 2's best response is always A1. This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario where the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in 1 point for each player.

**Step 2: Analyze the contract terms.**
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 1 point, and the other player pays 1 point.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point, and the other player receives 1 point.
We calculate the new payoff matrix if the contract is signed (and thus active):
- (A0, A0): P1 gets 2 (base) + 1 (for choosing A0) - 1 (P2 chose A0) = 2. P2 gets 2 + 1 - 1 = 2.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 (base) + 1 (for choosing A0) + 1 (P2 chose A1) = 2. P2 gets 3 (base) - 1 (for choosing A1) - 1 (P1 chose A0) = 1.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3 (base) - 1 (for choosing A1) - 1 (P2 chose A0) = 1. P2 gets 0 (base) + 1 (for choosing A0) + 1 (P1 chose A1) = 2.
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 1 (base) - 1 (for choosing A1) + 1 (P2 chose A1) = 1. P2 gets 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.

**Step 3: Analyze the contract game.**
The contract payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (2, 1)
- (A1, A0): (1, 2)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)
In this modified game, Player 1's best response is now A0 (since 2 > 1 in both cases), and Player 2's best response is also A0. The new Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), resulting in 2 points for each player.

**Step 4: Determine whether to sign.**
- If the contract is signed by both, the expected outcome is (2, 2).
- If the contract is not signed by at least one player, the original game persists, and the expected outcome is (1, 1).
Since 2 points are better than 1 point, and Player 2 (having proposed the contract) is highly likely to sign it, signing the contract is the optimal strategy for Player 1.

response:
Sure, let's break down the problem and find the optimal strategy.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Payoff Matrix without Contract:**
   - (A0, A0): (2, 2)
   - (A0, A1): (0, 3)
   - (A1, A0): (3, 0)
   - (A1, A1): (1, 1)

2. **Contract Impact:**
   - Choosing A0 grants an additional point but takes 1 point from the other player.
   - Choosing A1 costs a point and gives 1 point to the other player.

### Updated Payoff with Contract:
   - (A0, A0): (3, 3)
   - (A0, A1): (0, 4)
   - (A1, A0): (4, 0)
   - (A1, A1): (0, 0)

### Analysis:
- Without the contract, the game had a competitive edge, but the contract skews the payoff in favor of cooperative behavior, particularly choosing A0.
- Choosing A0 by both players yields the highest mutual payoff due to the added point from the contract.

### Expected Value Calculation:
Let's denote the probabilities for choosing A0 and A1 for Player 1 as \(p\) and \(1-p\) and for Player 2 as \(q\) and \(1-q\).

- For Player 2 (you):
  - Expected payoff if Player 2 chooses A0: \(3q + 0(1 - q)\)
  - Expected payoff if Player 2 chooses A1: \(4q + 0(1 - q)\)

Comparing the expected values:
- Choosing A0: \(3q\)
- Choosing A1: \(4q\)

Thus, for maximizing Player 2's points:
- When \(q = 1\) (i.e., if Player 1 always chooses A0), it is better for Player 2 to choose A1.
- However, if Player 2 also chooses A1 always, Player 1 benefits more from switching to A0 due to the zero-sum nature when any player deviates.

### Nash Equilibrium Consideration:
Neither player would benefit from deviating from choosing A1 if the other does so, but both players can achieve mutual benefit by both players choosing A0.

Given the additional analysis:
- The optimal strategy for Player 2 is choosing A0 with a high probability to align incentives.

### Final Strategy JSON:
```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

Choosing A0, considering the contract incentives, seems to be the dominant strategy for both players. 

### Final Answer:
```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

response:
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without contracts)

We're in a two-player simultaneous-move game. Each player chooses between A0 and A1 with some probability (we'll consider mixed strategies later). The payoff matrix is:

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **You (Player 2): A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **You (Player 2): A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

Since you are **Player 2**, your payoffs are:

- (A0, A0): 2
- (A0, A1): 0
- (A1, A0): 3
- (A1, A1): 1

This is a classic **coordination game with conflict**: both players benefit from coordinating on A0 (2 each), but if you play A1 while the other plays A0, you get 3 (better than 2) — so A1 is tempting if you think the other will play A0.

### Step 2: Analyze the pure strategy Nash equilibria

Let’s find the Nash equilibria of the base game.

- (A0, A0): If you deviate to A1, you get 1 < 2 → no incentive to deviate. So stable.
- (A1, A1): If you deviate to A0, you get 0 < 1 → no incentive. So stable.
- (A0, A1): You get 0; if you switch to A1, you get 1 > 0 → so you want to deviate → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): You get 3; if you switch to A0, you get 2 < 3 → you don’t want to deviate. But Player 1 gets 0 vs. 3 — so Player 1 wants to deviate → not equilibrium.

So the two pure strategy Nash equilibria are:
- (A0, A0)
- (A1, A1)

But note: (A0, A0) is better for both players (2 each) than (A1, A1) (1 each), so it’s a Pareto-superior outcome.

However, (A1, A0) gives you 3, which is tempting — but not stable unless Player 1 is committed to A0.

So coordination on A0 is efficient but fragile.

---

### Step 3: Understand the contract mechanism

A contract can be added **if both players agree via approval voting**.

Each contract specifies **additional payments** for each action (can be positive or negative). But the key is:

> "additional payments" are **drawn equally from the other player(s)**, or **distributed equally among others**.

That means:
- If you get +2 for A0, you are **taking 2 points** from the other player.
- If you pay -1 for A1, you are **giving 1 point to the other player**.

So, the **net effect on total payoffs** is zero: money is only redistributed.

Also, **contracts are applied on top of the base game payoffs**, and are **independent of the other player's action**, but depend only on **your own action**.

Therefore, the **total payoff** you get is:

> Base payoff (from game outcome) + contract payment (based on your own action)

---

### Step 4: Analyze Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)

> **C1 (by Player 1):**
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, **drawn equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +2 (you take 2 from the other player).
- If **you** choose A1 → no additional payment.
- Similarly for the other player.

But note: **"drawn equally from the other players"** — since only two players, each player pays half of the 2 points if they play A0 → you get +2, and the **other player loses 2**.

So **your net gain** from choosing A0 now includes:
- +2 from the contract

But **the other player** loses 2 if they play A0.

So effective payoffs (your total from the game) become:

Let’s update the payoff matrix (your payoffs only), accounting for the contract.

| Your Action | Other's Action | Base Payoff | Contract Gain | Total Payoff |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| A0          | A0             | 2            | +2             | **4**          |
| A0          | A1             | 0            | +2             | **2**          |
| A1          | A0             | 3            | 0              | **3**          |
| A1          | A1             | 1            | 0              | **1**          |

So now, the **new payoff matrix for you (Player 2)** is:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | 4      | 2      |
| **You: A1**   | 3      | 1      |

**Observation**: A0 now dominates A1 for you!
- If P1 plays A0: A0 (4) > A1 (3)
- If P1 plays A1: A0 (2) > A1 (1)

So **no matter what P1 does, you prefer A0**.

Therefore, **you are incentivized to play A0**, so you will **definitely** play A0.

In equilibrium, P1 will also see that:
- If they play A0, and you play A0, they get base 2 + contract -2 = 0
- If they play A1, and you play A0, they get base 0 + contract 0 = 0

But if they play A0, and you play A0 → you both get 4 and 0 in total (you: 4, P1: 0) — so P1 is worse off.

But P1 might want to play A1?

Wait: actually, P1’s total payoff in this case:

| P1: A0 | You: A0 | P1 base: 2 | P1 contract: -2 | Total: 0 |
|--------|---------|------------|------------------|----------|
| P1: A0 | You: A1 | P1 base: 3 | P1 contract: -2 | Total: 1 |
| P1: A1 | You: A0 | P1 base: 0 | P1 contract: 0 | Total: 0 |
| P1: A1 | You: A1 | P1 base: 1 | P1 contract: 0 | Total: 1 |

But you are **always playing A0** (since it's dominant), so P1’s best response is:
- Play A1 → get 0
- Play A0 → get 0

So indifferent between A0 and A1.

But note: **if P1 plays A0**, they get 0; if P1 plays A1, they get 0 → so no difference.

But now, from your perspective, you get 4 if you play A0 and P1 plays A0, or 2 if P1 plays A1.

So if P1 plays A1, you still get 2.

But what if P1 wants to avoid giving you the +2?

But P1 cannot control your action — you will always play A0.

So P1 might as well play A1 — still gets 0.

But there’s a twist: **P1 can get positive payoff only if they play A1 and you play A0**, giving P1 0 — same as playing A0.

So P1 is indifferent.

But now, **what if P1 plays A0?** Then P1 gets base 2, but loses 2 from contract → net 0.

If P1 plays A1, gets base 0 or 1, no cost → total 0 or 1.

So actually, **P1 prefers A1** if they think you are playing A0.

But if P1 plays A1, you still get 2.

So the only stable outcomes are:
- P1 plays A1, you play A0 → you get 2, P1 gets 0
- Or P1 plays A0, you play A0 → you get 4, P1 gets 0

But since P1 is indifferent, **P1 will not necessarily play A0**, but could play A1.

But from **your** perspective: you get **at least 2** in any case, and **could get 4** if P1 plays A0.

But note: **if P1 doesn't want to approve the contract**, they will reject it.

But the contract only applies **if both approve**.

So you need to decide:
- Should **you** approve C1?

**Your payoff under C1 depends on whether P1 approves it**.

But if you **don’t approve**, the contract doesn’t apply → back to base game.

But the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if both approve C1 and C2, then C1 wins with 50% probability.

But we need to decide: **Will C1 benefit you?**

From your perspective, under C1 (if approved and both play), you get:

- A0, A0 → you get 4
- A0, A1 → you get 2
- A1, A0 → 3
- A1, A1 → 1

But you will **play A0**, so best you can do is 4 or 2.

Now compare to base game: in base game, best you can get is 3 (if A1, A0), or 2 (if A0, A0).

But the problem is: **if you approve C1, but P1 doesn’t**, then C1 doesn’t apply → back to base game.

But if **you approve C1**, and **P1 also approves**, then C1 applies → you benefit.

But if **only you approve**, and P1 doesn't, C1 doesn’t apply.

But the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So if only you approve C1, and P1 approves C2, then:
- C1 has 1 approval
- C2 has 1 approval
→ maximum approval is 1 → so one of them is chosen uniformly at random → C1 wins with 50% chance.

But that means: **with 50% chance, you get C1 (which benefits you), 50% chance you get C2, which may hurt you.**

But we don’t yet know about C2.

So let’s analyze C2 first.

---

### Step 5: Analyze Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)

> **C2 (by Player 2):**
> - If a player chooses A0, no additional payment.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If **you** play A1 → you pay 1 point → you lose 1 point.
- If you play A0 → no cost.

The payment is **distributed equally among the other players** → so since there’s only one other player, **you lose 1, and the other player gains 1**.

So your payoff is reduced by 1 if you play A1.

So updated payoff matrix (your payoffs):

| Your | P1 | Base | Contract | Total |
|------|----|------|----------|-------|
| A0   | A0 | 2    | 0        | **2** |
| A0   | A1 | 0    | 0        | **0** |
| A1   | A0 | 3    | -1       | **2** |
| A1   | A1 | 1    | -1       | **0** |

So new payoff matrix:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | 2      | 0      |
| **You: A1**   | 2      | 0      |

Now **both A0 and A1 give you the same payoff: 2 if P1 plays A0, 0 if P1 plays A1**.

So your best choice depends on P1.

But note: **you are indifferent between A0 and A1** — but only if P1 plays A0 you get 2, if P1 plays A1 you get 0.

Now, what does P1 get under C2?

P1’s payoffs:
- A0, A0: base 2 + no cost (since they didn’t play A1) → 2
- A0, A1: base 3 → no cost for P1 → 3
- A1, A0: base 0 → but P1 played A1 → pays 1 → so 0 - 1 = -1
- A1, A1: base 1 → P1 plays A1 → pays 1 → 0

So P1’s payoff matrix:

| P1: A0 | You: A0 | 2 |
|--------|---------|---|
| P1: A0 | You: A1 | 3 |
| P1: A1 | You: A0 | -1 |
| P1: A1 | You: A1 | 0 |

So P1’s best response:
- If you play A0 → P1 prefers A0 (2) vs A1 (-1) → so plays A0
- If you play A1 → P1 prefers A0 (3) vs A1 (0) → so plays A0

So **P1 will always play A0**.

Then, since P1 plays A0, you get:
- If you play A0: 2
- If you play A1: 2

So you are indifferent.

So you can play A0 or A1 — doesn't matter.

But **you get 2** in either case, since P1 plays A0.

So **if C2 is approved and applied**, you are guaranteed **at least 2**.

In fact, **you get exactly 2**.

Now compare to:

- Base game: you might get 3 (if you play A1 and P1 plays A0), or 2 (if both A0), or 1 (if both A1), or 0.

But now, if C2 applies, you get **2 for sure**, and P1 is forced to play A0.

But in the base game, you only get 2 if both play A0, but you might get **3** if you play A1 and P1 plays A0.

So **C2 reduces your payoff from the possibility of 3 → 2**.

Is that bad?

Yes — you lose the opportunity to get 3.

In base game, you could **strategically play A1** to get 3 if P1 plays A0.

But under C2, you can't — because playing A1 gives you only 2, same as A0.

So you are **worse off** in terms of potential maximum payoff — and you **cannot** get more than 2.

So **C2 hurts your potential**.

But does it protect you from worst-case?

In base game, worst case is 0 or 1.

In C2, you get 2 for sure.

So it **locks in** a better worst-case payoff.

But since you can get 3 in base game, and you are risk-neutral (we assume), **you prefer higher expected payoff**.

But you need to compare outcomes **conditional on the contract being applied**.

But the key is: **you are trying to maximize your total points, assuming the contract is applied.**

So let’s compare:

- Without contract (base game), if both players play A0 → you get 2.
- If you play A1 and P1 plays A0 → you get 3.

But C2 makes that impossible — you can’t get 3.

So unless you are risk-averse, C2 is **detrimental** to you.

Moreover, **P1 benefits from C2**: they are forced to play A0 (since A1 gives them -1 or 0 vs 2 or 3), so P1 never plays A1.

So P1 will prefer C2 (they avoid the cost of A1).

But **you don’t want to be constrained** — you want to be able to exploit P1 playing A0 by playing A1.

So **you should not approve C2**.

---

### Step 6: Decide whether to approve C1 and C2

#### C1 (by Player 1):
- If you approve it, and it is applied, you get:
  - A0, A0 → 4 (best case)
  - A0, A1 → 2 (still decent)
  - But you will play A0 (dominant strategy)
- So **you get 4 if P1 plays A0, 2 if P1 plays A1**

But can P1 be induced to play A0?

- If P1 plays A0 and you play A0 → P1 gets base 2 - 2 = 0
- If P1 plays A1 and you play A0 → P1 gets base 0 + 0 = 0

So P1 is indifferent.

So P1 may play A1 → you get 2.

But if you approve C1, and P1 **also approves**, then C1 applies → you get 4 if P1 plays A0, or 2 if P1 plays A1.

But P1 might **not** want to approve C1 — because they get **0 payoff** in either case.

In fact, if they approve, they get **0**, but if they don't approve, **no contract**, and they could get:
- If both play A0 → 2
- If you play A1 → 3 (if P1 plays A0)

So **P1 would prefer NOT to approve C1**, because they get 2 or 3 in base game, but only 0 under C1.

So P1 will **not approve C1**.

Therefore, even if **you approve C1**, **P1 will not approve it**, because C1 gives them **no benefit and a cost when they play A0**.

So C1 **will not be applied**.

Therefore, **approving C1 gains you nothing** — the contract won’t apply.

But approving it does **nothing** — it’s not binding.

And if you approve it alone, and C2 is approved, then max approvals is 1 — so C1 has 50% chance of being selected.

But if C1 is selected, you get **only if P1 also approved**, but they won’t — because they lose.

Wait: **approval is separate from implementation**.

The contract works **only if both approve**.

But the voting process: **each player approves independently**, and then **the winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So:
- If you approve C1 only → C1 has 1 approval
- If P1 approves C2 only → C2 has 1 approval
→ max approval = 1 → so either contract is chosen with 50% chance.

So **C1 has 50% chance of being applied**, **if selected, it applies only if both approve**.

But if **C1 is selected**, but **P1 did not approve**, then **C1 does not apply** — because it’s not approved by both.

Wait: the problem says:

> "the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

But **only contracts that have been approved by both players can be applied**? Or just by some?

Wait: **"approval voting process"** — it doesn't say it's unanimous, just **approval**.

But the contract **only applies if both approve?** Or just if approved?

The problem says:

> "a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process."

"Agree" — probably **both approve**.

But the voting process is not specified as requiring both — it says "approval voting process" — but then "the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals".

This is **only one contract** will be selected — even if multiple are approved.

But **if only one contract is approved by both**, then it applies.

But if multiple contracts are approved, but not by both, then **no contract** applies?

Wait, the problem says: "a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process."

That suggests **both players agree** — so **only contracts approved by both players can be applied**.

But the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Let me re-read:

> "a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process."

"Players" — plural — so **both must agree**.

And "approval voting process" — likely means **each votes yes/no**.

So a contract is implemented **only if both approve it**.

Then, **if multiple contracts are approved by both**, then one is chosen uniformly at random.

But if **no contract is approved by both**, then **no contract applies**.

But in our case, the contracts are:

- C1: proposed by P1 — will P1 approve it?
- C2: proposed by P2 — will you approve it?

But **you are Player 2**, and **P1 is the other player**.

So:

- For C1 to apply: P1 and you both must approve C1.
- For C2 to apply: P1 and you both must approve C2.

But the voting is **simultaneous**, and you must decide your own approvals.

Now, **if you approve C1, and P1 does not**, then C1 is not applied.

Similarly, if you approve C2, but P1 doesn't, then C2 is not applied.

But **P1 will not approve C1**, because they lose 2 when they play A0 (net 0), while in base game they can get 2 or 3.

So P1 will **not approve C1**.

Similarly, **will P1 approve C2?**

C2: if you play A1, you pay 1 → you lose 1.

P1 gets nothing directly — but in C2, if you play A1 → P1 gets 1 more (since you pay 1, distributed to P1).

But P1’s payoff under C2:

As computed earlier:
- If P1 plays A0 → gets 2 or 3
- If P1 plays A1 → gets -1 or 0

So P1 will **prefer A0**, no matter what.

And if P1 plays A0, you get 2 (whether you play A0 or A1) → P1 gets 2.

But in base game, if both play A0 → P1 gets 2.

So P1 gets same payoff.

But P1 **cannot get 3** under C2 — because they can't play A1 and get 3.

In base game, if you play A1, P1 gets 3.

But if C2 is in, and you play A1, you pay 1 → P1 gets 1 more.

But P1 can't play A1 to get 3 — because they don't want to.

So P1’s maximum is 2 under C2.

But in base game, they can get 3.

So **P1 prefers not to approve C2**, because they can get 3 in base game, but only 2 under C2.

So **P1 will reject both C1 and C2**.

Therefore:
- C1: P1 will not approve → so C1 not applied
- C2: P1 will not approve → so C2 not applied

So **no contract applies** — back to base game.

Now, your decision: should you approve C1? C2?

You can **approve** a contract, but if **P1 doesn't approve**, it doesn't apply.

But **if you approve a contract, and P1 also approves it**, then it applies and may benefit you.

But P1 **will not approve either**, as we’ve seen.

So **no contract will ever apply**, regardless of your approval.

Therefore, **your approval has no effect on the outcome**.

So you might as well **approve neither**, or **approve one** — it doesn’t matter.

But wait: **what if you approve a contract**, and P1 **also approves**, then it applies.

But P1 will not approve **any** contract, as we’ve argued.

So even if you approve C1, P1 won’t — so no contract applies.

Thus, **your approval is irrelevant** — you can’t affect the outcome.

But the problem says: **"Return a valid JSON object with your approvals"**, so you **must** vote.

But since **no contract applies in any case**, your choice has no impact.

So you might as well approve the one that **you prefer**, or **the one that does not hurt you**.

But both C1 and C2 are **not beneficial to you** when applied, because:

- C1: if applied, you might get 4 or 2 — but only if P1 plays A0. But P1 won’t approve C1, so not applied.
- C2: if applied, you get 2 for sure — but in base game you can get 3 — so **you are worse off** under C2.

So even if C2 were applied, you lose.

But since P1 won’t approve it, no risk.

So you **should not approve C2**, because it makes you worse off if applied.

You are **not sure** that C1 would be applied, but if it were, you benefit.

But **P1 won’t approve C1**, so it won’t be applied.

Thus, **approving C1 gives you no benefit**, but also no cost.

But **approving C2 would hurt you** if applied — but since P1 won’t approve, it’s safe.

But the **contract might be applied** only if both approve.

Since P1 won’t approve any contract, **no contract is applied**.

So **your approval doesn't matter**.

But you might want to **maximize the possibility of a good contract** being applied.

But P1 won’t approve anything that hurts them.

So **you should avoid approving a contract that would make you worse off** if applied.

C2 would make you worse off: in base game, max 3; under C2, max 2.

So you should **not approve C2**, even if it’s a safe choice — because if it were applied, you’d be worse.

Similarly, C1: if applied, you could get 4 — better than base game 3.

So C1 is **beneficial** if applied.

So approving C1 is **safe** — you don’t lose anything if not applied.

Approving C2 is **risky** — you could be harmed if applied.

But since both contracts require P1’s approval, and P1 won’t approve either, the outcome is the same.

But to be rational, you should **approve C1** because it benefits you if applied, and **not approve C2** because it harms you if applied.

Even though P1 won’t approve, if they did, C1 is good for you, C2 is bad.

So you should approve C1, not C2.

---

### Final Decision:

- **C1 (Player 1's contract)**: approve — because it could benefit you if applied (you can get 4 vs base 3), and it doesn't hurt you.
- **C2 (Player 2's contract)**: do **not** approve — because it restricts your options and lowers your payoff from 3 to 2.

Even though both require P1's approval and thus won’t apply, **you should still vote for the one that benefits you** and against the one that harms you.

Thus, the optimal strategy is to approve C1 and reject C2.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix WITHOUT the contract

|          | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| I play A0 | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)        |
| I play A1 | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)        |

*(My payoff listed first)*

## Step 2: Find the equilibrium WITHOUT the contract

From my perspective:
- If other plays A0: A1 gives me 3 vs A0 gives me 2 → A1 better
- If other plays A1: A1 gives me 1 vs A0 gives me 0 → A1 better

A1 strictly dominates A0, so the Nash equilibrium is both players choosing A1.
**Without contract, I expect to get 1 point.**

## Step 3: Apply the contract terms

Contract: If a player chooses A0, they receive +2 points from the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- Both A0: (2, 2) + I get 2 from them - I pay 2 to them = **(2, 2)**
- I play A0, they A1: (0, 3) + I get 2 from them = **(2, 1)**
- I play A1, they A0: (3, 0) - I pay 2 to them = **(1, 2)**
- Both A1: (1, 1) + no transfers = **(1, 1)**

## Step 4: Find the equilibrium WITH the contract

From my perspective:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 2 vs A1 gives me 1 → A0 better
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 2 vs A1 gives me 1 → A0 better

A0 now strictly dominates A1! The Nash equilibrium becomes both players choosing A0.
**With contract, I expect to get 2 points.**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- Without contract: 1 point
- With contract: 2 points

Since 2 > 1, signing the contract is beneficial.

## Conclusion

The contract transforms the game from a prisoner's dilemma (where mutual defection yields 1 point) into a coordination game (where mutual cooperation yields 2 points). This is clearly advantageous for me.

response:
In this game, the goal is to determine the optimal probability distribution between actions A0 and A1 by considering both the base payoffs and the additional contract payments.

### 1. Base Game Payoffs
The payoffs for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2) are given as:
*   (A0, A0): (2, 2)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 3) (P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1; you are P2)
*   (A1, A0): (3, 0) (P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0)
*   (A1, A1): (1, 1)

### 2. Contract Impact
The contract states:
*   If a player chooses A0, they receive +2 points from the other player.
*   If a player chooses A1, there is no payment.

Let's calculate the final payoffs after the contract is applied for Player 2 (you):
*   **(A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives +2 and each pays 2. The net change is 0. 
    Final payoff: (2+0, 2+0) = **(2, 2)**
*   **(A0, A1):** P1 chooses A0 (+2 points), P2 chooses A1 (pays 2 points).
    P1 final: 0 + 2 = 2. 
    P2 final: 3 - 2 = 1.
    Final payoff: **(2, 1)**
*   **(A1, A0):** P1 chooses A1 (pays 2 points), P2 chooses A0 (+2 points).
    P1 final: 3 - 2 = 1. 
    P2 final: 0 + 2 = 2.
    Final payoff: **(1, 2)**
*   **(A1, A1):** Neither player chooses A0. No payments are made.
    Final payoff: **(1, 1)**

### 3. Strategy Analysis
From Player 2's perspective (the columns):
*   If Player 1 chooses A0: Your payoff is 2 (A0) or 1 (A1). **A0 is better.**
*   If Player 1 chooses A1: Your payoff is 2 (A0) or 1 (A1). **A0 is better.**

Because selecting A0 yields a higher payoff regardless of the other player's decision, A0 is the dominant strategy. Similarly, Player 1's final payoffs (2 if A0, 1 if A1) make A0 their dominant strategy as well. Choosing A0 maximizes your total points by ensuring a payoff of 2, compared to the payoff of 1 you would receive by choosing A1.

### Final Probability Distribution
Since A0 is the strictly dominant strategy for maximizing points, 100% of the probability weight is assigned to A0.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let’s analyze how the contract alters the payoffs in the given game.

### Original Payoff Table

|          | A0 (Player 2) | A1 (Player 2) |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **A0 (Player 1)** | (2, 2)          | (0, 3)       |
| **A1 (Player 1)** | (3, 0)          | (1, 1)       |

### Contract Adjustment

The contract stipulates that if a player chooses:
- A0: They receive an additional point (1) from the other player.
- A1: They pay an additional point (1) to the other player.

This modifies the payoffs as follows:

1. **If both players choose A0**, each player gets an additional 1 point from the other, resulting in:
    - Player 1: 2 + 1 = 3 points
    - Player 2: 2 + 1 = 3 points

2. **If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1**: 
    - Player 1 receives: 0 points initially and an additional 1 point from Player 2 choosing A1:
        - Player 1: 0 + 1 = 1 point
    - Player 2 receives:
        - Player 2: 0 points and incurs a 1-point penalty for choosing A1:
        - Player 2: 3 - 1 = 2 points

3. **If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0**:
    - Player 1 receives:
        - Player 1: 3 points (initially) and incurs a 1-point penalty for choosing A1:
        - Player 1: 3 - 1 = 2 points
    - Player 2 receives:
        - Player 2: 0 points and gains 1 point for choosing A0
        - Player 2: 0 + 1 = 1 point

4. **If both players choose A1**:
    - Both players get 1 point initially and incur a 1-point penalty:
        - Player 1: 1 - 1 = 0 points
        - Player 2: 1 - 1 = 0 points

### Modified Payoff Table

|          | A0 (Player 2) | A1 (Player 2) |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **A0 (Player 1)** | (3, 3)           | (1, 2)       |
| **A1 (Player 1)** | (2, 1)           | (0, 0)       |

### Decision Analysis

Without the contract:
- Player 2 might often prefer A1 for potentially higher points when Player 1 chooses A0.

With the contract:
- The payoffs for choosing A1 consistently become less attractive as the penalties cut into the points.

### Conclusion

The contract incentivizes cooperation and reduces the attractiveness of non-cooperative choices. If both players are rational and aim to maximize their payoffs, signing the contract would be beneficial. The optimal strategy moves toward both selecting A0.

Therefore, you should sign the contract.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the game payoffs both with and without the contract.

### 1. The Original Game (Without Contract)
The original game is a standard Prisoner's Dilemma with the following payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

In this scenario, A1 is the dominant strategy for both players because:
- If the other player chooses A0, A1 gives 3 points (compared to 2 from A0).
- If the other player chooses A1, A1 gives 1 point (compared to 0 from A0).
If both players act rationally to maximize their own points, they will both choose A1, resulting in a payoff of **(1, 1)**.

### 2. The Game With the Contract
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."
If both players sign, the payoffs are adjusted as follows:
- **(A0, A0):** Both get 2 points. Both receive 2 points (from each other) and both pay 2 points (to each other). Net payoff: 2 + 2 - 2 = **2 points**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 (A0) gets 0 base points + 2 from Player 2. Player 2 (A1) gets 3 base points - 2 paid to Player 1. Net payoffs: **(2, 1)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 (A1) gets 3 base points - 2 paid to Player 2. Player 2 (A0) gets 0 base points + 2 from Player 1. Net payoffs: **(1, 2)**.
- **(A1, A1):** Both stay with their base payoffs. Net payoff: **(1, 1)**.

### 3. Comparing the Results
In the contract-adjusted payoff matrix:
- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 2 points from A0 and 1 point from A1. (A0 is better)
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 2 points from A0 and 1 point from A1. (A0 is better)

Now, A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both players. If both players sign and act rationally under the new rules, they will both play A0, resulting in a payoff of **(2, 2)**.

### Conclusion
By signing the contract, you transition the game from a Nash equilibrium of (1, 1) to a Nash equilibrium of (2, 2). This is universally better for both players and eliminates the incentive to "defect" with A1.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing points, let’s first analyze the original payoff matrix and then apply the effects of the mandatory payment contract.

### 1. Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2)
- **(A0, A0):** (2, 2)
- **(A0, A1):** (0, 3)
- **(A1, A0):** (3, 0)
- **(A1, A1):** (1, 1)

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma where the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1).

### 2. Impact of the Payment Contract
The contract specifies:
- If a player chooses **A0**, they receive **+2 points** from the other player.
- If a player chooses **A1**, no additional payments are made.

Now, let's recalculate the payoffs based on these incentives:

- **Both choose A0:**
  - Initial: (2, 2)
  - Player 1 receives 2 from Player 2 (for A0): (2+2, 2-2) = (4, 0)
  - Player 2 receives 2 from Player 1 (for A0): (4-2, 0+2) = (2, 2)
  - **Final: (2, 2)**

- **Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:**
  - Initial: (0, 3)
  - Player 1 receives 2 from Player 2 (for A0): (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1)
  - Player 2 receives nothing (for A1).
  - **Final: (2, 1)**

- **Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:**
  - Initial: (3, 0)
  - Player 1 receives nothing (for A1).
  - Player 2 receives 2 from Player 1 (for A0): (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2)
  - **Final: (1, 2)**

- **Both choose A1:**
  - Initial: (1, 1)
  - No additional payments.
  - **Final: (1, 1)**

### 3. Revised Payoff Matrix
| | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2) | (2, 1) |
| **Player 1: A1** | (1, 2) | (1, 1) |

### 4. Strategic Analysis
In this revised scenario:
- If Player 2 plays **A0**, Player 1 receives **2** points by playing A0 and **1** point by playing A1.
- If Player 2 plays **A1**, Player 1 receives **2** points by playing A0 and **1** point by playing A1.

In both cases, **A0 is the dominant strategy** for Player 1. Since the payoff matrix is symmetric, A0 is also the dominant strategy for Player 2. By choosing A0 with 100% probability, Player 1 ensures the highest possible payoff regardless of Player 2's action.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understanding the Contract's Impact

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0: they receive +2 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1: no additional payment

With 2 players, this means:
- When I choose A0: I gain +2 points (from Player 1)
- When Player 1 chooses A0: I lose -2 points (paid to Player 1)

### Step 2: Calculate My Modified Payoffs

Let me compute my total payoff for each outcome:

| My Action | Player 1 Action | Base Payoff | My Contract Gain | My Contract Loss | **Total** |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| A0        | A0             | 2           | +2               | -2               | **2**     |
| A0        | A1             | 0           | +2               | 0                | **2**     |
| A1        | A0             | 3           | 0                | -2               | **1**     |
| A1        | A1             | 1           | 0                | 0                | **1**     |

### Step 3: Identify the Optimal Strategy

Looking at my payoffs:
- **If I choose A0**: I get 2 points regardless of Player 1's choice
- **If I choose A1**: I get 1 point regardless of Player 1's choice

**A0 strictly dominates A1!** 

No matter what probability distribution Player 1 uses, choosing A0 always gives me a higher expected payoff than choosing A1.

### Step 4: Verify the Equilibrium

For completeness, Player 1's payoffs are:
- When they choose A0: 2 points (regardless of my action)
- When they choose A1: 1 point (regardless of my action)

Player 1 also has A0 as a strictly dominant strategy. The contract has created a game where both players are incentivized to always choose A0, resulting in mutual cooperation.

### Conclusion

My optimal strategy is to choose A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

The original payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0
- (A1, A0): I get 3  
- (A1, A1): I get 1

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma. A1 is the dominant strategy for both players:
- If P1 plays A0, I prefer A1 (3 > 2)
- If P1 plays A1, I prefer A1 (1 > 0)

**Nash equilibrium without contracts: (A1, A1) → I get 1 point**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1: Player choosing A0 gets +2 from opponent

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 2 + 2(receive for A0) - 2(pay for P1's A0) = **2**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2(receive for A0) - 0 = **2**
- (A1, A0): 3 + 0 - 2(pay for P1's A0) = **1**
- (A1, A1): 1 + 0 - 0 = **1**

Now A0 dominates A1 (2 > 1 in both cases). By symmetry, A0 also dominates for Player 1.

**Nash equilibrium with Contract 1: (A0, A0) → I get 2 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2: Player choosing A1 pays 2 to opponent

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 2 + 0 - 0 = **2**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 0 + 2(receive from P1's A1) = **2**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2(pay for A1) + 0 = **1**
- (A1, A1): 1 - 2(pay for A1) + 2(receive from P1's A1) = **1**

Again, A0 dominates A1 (2 > 1 in both cases). By symmetry, same for Player 1.

**Nash equilibrium with Contract 2: (A0, A0) → I get 2 points**

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts:
- Transform the payoff structure identically
- Change A0 to the dominant strategy
- Lead to equilibrium (A0, A0) giving me 2 points instead of 1
- Both improve my outcome from 1 to 2 points

Since both contracts benefit me equally and significantly improve my expected payoff, I should approve both to maximize the chance that at least one contract gets implemented.

    *   P1 chooses A1: P1 pays -1, P2 gets +1.
    *   P2 chooses A0: P2 gets +1, P1 pays -1.
    *   **Final Points: (3 - 1 - 1, 0 + 1 + 1) = (1, 2)**

*   **Scenario (A1, A1):**
    *   Base: (1, 1)
    *   P1 chooses A1: P1 pays -1, P2 gets +1.
    *   P2 chooses A1: P2 pays -1, P1 gets +1.
    *   **Final Points: (1 - 1 + 1, 1 - 1 + 1) = (1, 1)**

### 4. Strategic Analysis
In the modified payoff matrix:
*   If you choose **A0**, you receive **2 points** regardless of whether Player 2 chooses A0 or A1.
*   If you choose **A1**, you receive **1 point** regardless of whether Player 2 chooses A0 or A1.

Since 2 points is always better than 1 point, choosing A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for you. Similarly, since Player 2 also receives more points (2 points vs 1 point) by choosing A0, it is also a dominant strategy for them.

### 5. Final Decision
Given that choosing A0 guarantees the maximum possible points (2) for any action taken by the other player, the optimal strategy is to commit 100% to action A0.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
To maximize your total points in this decision-making game, let's first analyze the base game and then evaluate how each proposed contract modifies the outcomes.

### 1. Analysis of the Base Game
The payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2 (you) is as follows:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (3, 0)
- (A1, A0): (0, 3)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)
*(Note: Based on identifying yourself as Player 2: if you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you get 0 and they get 3. This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma.)*

In the absence of a contract, Player 1 and Player 2 both have a dominant strategy to choose **A1**, as it yields higher points regardless of the other player's choice (3 > 2 and 1 > 0). This results in a Nash Equilibrium of **(A1, A1)**, where both players receive **1 point**.

### 2. Analysis of Contract 1 (C1)
C1 stipulates that playing A0 results in receiving 1 point from the other player, while playing A1 results in paying 1 point to the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** Each player receives 1 and pays 1. Net change is 0. Payoffs remain **(2, 2)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 (A0) receives 1 from P2 and receives another 1 because P2 chose A1. Player 1: 0 + 2 = 2. Player 2: 3 - 2 = 1. Result: **(2, 1)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 2 (A0) receives 1 from P1 and receives another 1 because P1 chose A1. Player 1: 3 - 2 = 1. Player 2: 0 + 2 = 2. Result: **(1, 2)**.
- **(A1, A1):** Each player pays 1 and receives 1. Net change is 0. Payoffs remain **(1, 1)**.

Under C1, choosing **A0** becomes the dominant strategy for both players (2 > 1). The new Nash Equilibrium is **(A0, A0)**, yielding **2 points** for you.

### 3. Analysis of Contract 2 (C2)
C2 stipulates that playing A0 results in receiving 2 points from the other player, with no payments for playing A1.
- **(A0, A0):** Each player receives 2 and pays 2. Net change is 0. Payoffs remain **(2, 2)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 (A0) receives 2 points from P2. Player 1: 0 + 2 = 2. Player 2: 3 - 2 = 1. Result: **(2, 1)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 2 (A0) receives 2 points from P1. Player 1: 3 - 2 = 1. Player 2: 0 + 2 = 2. Result: **(1, 2)**.
- **(A1, A1):** No payments are made. Payoffs remain **(1, 1)**.

Under C2, choosing **A0** also becomes the dominant strategy for both players (2 > 1). The new Nash Equilibrium is **(A0, A0)**, yielding **2 points** for you.

### 4. Decision
Both Contract 1 and Contract 2 successfully shift the equilibrium from the (A1, A1) outcome (1 point) to the cooperative (A0, A0) outcome (2 points). Since both contracts lead to a higher payoff for you than the base game, it is optimal to approve both.

response:
Step 1: Work out how the transfers affect *net* payoffs (2 players ⇒ any “received from the other” is exactly “paid by the other”).

A convenient way: **net transfer to Player 1** equals:
- what P1 gets/owes due to **P1’s own action**, plus
- what P1 pays/gets due to **P2’s action**.

---

## Contract C1 (P1 proposal)
- If you play **A0**: you **receive +1** from the other.
- If you play **A1**: you **pay 1** to the other.

So net transfer to P1:
- From P1’s action: A0 ⇒ +1, A1 ⇒ −1
- From P2’s action (symmetrically): if P2 plays A0 ⇒ P1 pays 1 (−1), if P2 plays A1 ⇒ P1 receives 1 (+1)

Compute net transfers and add to base payoffs:

- (A0,A0): +1 + (−1) = 0 ⇒ payoff stays **(2,2)**
- (A0,A1): +1 + (+1) = +2 ⇒ **(2,1)** (was (0,3))
- (A1,A0): −1 + (−1) = −2 ⇒ **(1,2)** (was (3,0))
- (A1,A1): −1 + (+1) = 0 ⇒ **(1,1)**

Resulting game for P1:  
Against either A0 or A1, **A0 gives 2 while A1 gives 1**, so **A0 becomes strictly dominant** and equilibrium is (A0,A0) giving me **2**.

---

## Contract C2 (P2 proposal)
- If you play **A0**: you **receive +2** from the other.
- If you play **A1**: **0** transfer.

Net transfer to P1:
- From P1’s action: A0 ⇒ +2, A1 ⇒ 0
- From P2’s action: if P2 plays A0 ⇒ P1 pays 2 (−2), if P2 plays A1 ⇒ 0

Compute:

- (A0,A0): +2 + (−2) = 0 ⇒ **(2,2)**
- (A0,A1): +2 + 0 = +2 ⇒ **(2,1)**
- (A1,A0): 0 + (−2) = −2 ⇒ **(1,2)**
- (A1,A1): 0 + 0 = 0 ⇒ **(1,1)**

This is **the same transformed payoff matrix** as C1 (with 2 players), so again A0 is strictly dominant and equilibrium gives me **2**.

---

## Approval decision
In the original game, **A1 is strictly dominant** and the equilibrium is (A1,A1) giving me **1**.  
Under **either** contract, the equilibrium payoff for me becomes **2**. So I approve both to maximize the chance that some approved contract is selected.

response:
Step 1: Understand what each contract does  
Both proposed contracts (C1 and C2) are identical:

- If you play **A0**: you **receive +1** point from the other player.  
- If you play **A1**: you **pay 1** point to the other player.

So the contract changes incentives by rewarding A0 and penalizing A1 via transfers.

Step 2: Compute how the contract changes my payoffs (Player 1)

Consider each action pair:

1) **(A0, A0)**  
- I get +1 from the other, but I also pay +1 to the other (since they also played A0 and “receive” it from me).  
- Net transfer = 0  
- Payoff stays: **2**

2) **(A0, A1)**  
- I played A0 ⇒ I receive **+1** from them  
- They played A1 ⇒ they pay **+1** to me  
- Net gain to me = +2  
- Base payoff was 0 ⇒ new payoff: **0 + 2 = 2**

3) **(A1, A0)**  
- I played A1 ⇒ I pay **1** to them  
- They played A0 ⇒ they receive **1** from me  
- Net loss to me = -2  
- Base payoff was 3 ⇒ new payoff: **3 - 2 = 1**

4) **(A1, A1)**  
- Both pay 1 to each other ⇒ net transfer 0  
- Payoff stays: **1**

So my adjusted payoff matrix becomes:

- (A0,A0)=2, (A0,A1)=2, (A1,A0)=1, (A1,A1)=1

Step 3: Best-response implication  
With the contract:

- If Player 2 plays A0: I prefer A0 (2 > 1)  
- If Player 2 plays A1: I prefer A0 (2 > 1)

So **A0 becomes strictly dominant**, leading to outcome **(A0,A0)** with payoff **2** to me.

Without the contract, **A1 is strictly dominant**, leading to **(A1,A1)** with payoff **1** to me.

So the contract improves my equilibrium payoff from **1 → 2**.

Step 4: Approval decision  
Since both C1 and C2 are the same and both benefit me, I approve both.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Non-Cooperative Game)**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two players and two actions each: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

We are told: **You are playing in the position of Player 2**.

So, we are **Player 2**, and we care about **maximizing our own points**, possibly influenced by contracts.

This is a classic **coordination game with a conflict of interest**. It's similar to a **Battle of the Sexes** but asymmetric.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria of the base game (without contracts).

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Nash Equilibria in Base Game**

We can look for pure strategy Nash equilibria.

- (A0, A0):  
  - Player 1: 2 (if deviates to A1, gets 3 → better) → not stable  
  - Player 2: 2 (if deviates to A1, gets 0 → worse) → stable for P2  
  But P1 wants to deviate → not NE

- (A1, A1):  
  - P1: 1 (deviate to A0 → gets 0 → worse)  
  - P2: 1 (deviate to A0 → gets 0 → worse)  
  So both have no incentive to deviate → **Pure NE**

- (A0, A1):  
  - P1: 0 → deviate to A1 → gets 1 → better → not NE

- (A1, A0):  
  - P1: 3 → deviate to A0 → gets 2 → worse  
  - P2: 0 → deviate to A1 → gets 1 → better → not NE

So **only pure NE is (A1, A1)** with payoff (1,1).

Now consider **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Let:
- Player 1 choose A0 with probability $ p $
- Player 2 choose A0 with probability $ q $

We want $ q $ such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

**Player 2’s expected payoff:**
- If choose A0: $ 2p + 0(1-p) = 2p $
- If choose A1: $ 3(1-p) + 1(1-p) = 3(1-p) + 1(1-p) = 4(1-p) $? Wait — typo?

Wait:  
When Player 2 chooses A0:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 2
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0  
→ Expected: $ 2p + 0(1-p) = 2p $

When Player 2 chooses A1:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1  
→ Expected: $ 3p + 1(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1 $

Set equal for indifference:
$$
2p = 2p + 1 \Rightarrow 0 = 1 \quad \text{Impossible}
$$

Wait — that can’t be. **Something’s wrong.**

Wait — **Player 2 is choosing action, so we need Player 2 to be indifferent between A0 and A1 given Player 1’s strategy**.

But since we’re analyzing Player 2’s best response to Player 1’s mixed strategy, yes.

But the equation:  
- U2(A0 | p) = 2p + 0(1-p) = 2p  
- U2(A1 | p) = 3p + 1(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1

Set equal:
$$
2p = 2p + 1 \Rightarrow 0 = 1 \quad \text{No solution}
$$

So **Player 2 always prefers A1 regardless of p** (since $ 2p + 1 > 2p $), unless... wait — is that true?

Yes:
- U2(A1) = 2p + 1
- U2(A0) = 2p
→ So A1 is always strictly better than A0.

So **Player 2 has a dominant strategy: A1**

Now check Player 1’s best response.

Player 1 chooses A0 with prob $ p $, Player 2 chooses A0 with prob $ q $

U1(A0 | q): 2q + 0(1-q) = 2q  
U1(A1 | q): 3(1-q) + 1(1-q) = 3(1-q) + 1(1-q) = 4(1-q) ??? No:

Wait — when Player 1 plays A1:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 3
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 1  
→ So U1(A1) = 3q + 1(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1

Set equal:
- U1(A0) = 2q
- U1(A1) = 2q + 1

So A1 is **always better** for Player 1 too!

→ **Both players have a dominant strategy: A1**

Therefore, **(A1, A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium, and the expected outcome in the base game is **(1,1)**.

So **in the base game**, no incentive to deviate, both play A1.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

Now contracts are introduced. Each contract specifies **additional payments** based on actions.

Two contracts proposed:

#### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1):**
- If a player chooses A0 → they receive an **additional +2 points**, **drawn equally from the other player**
- If a player chooses A1 → no additional payments

Note: "drawn equally from the other players" → since only two players, this means **the other player pays 2 points to the player who chooses A0**.

So:
- If I (Player 2) play A0 → I get +2 (from Player 1)
- If Player 1 plays A0 → Player 1 gets +2 (from Player 2)

No cost for A1.

So **from my (P2) perspective**, if I choose A0, I gain +2, regardless of what the other player does.

But that’s only if **I** play A0.

If I play A1 → no change.

So **Contract C1 gives players an incentive to play A0**, because A0 gives you a +2 bonus.

But wait — who pays? "drawn equally from the other players" → if both people play A0, **each gets +2 from the other**, so net +2 for each (A0)).

If only I play A0 → I get +2 (from P1), P1 gets nothing.

If only P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +2 (from me), I get nothing.

If both play A1 → no bonus.

So the **bonus is paid to the player who chooses A0**, funded by the **other player**.

So total payment from P1 to P2 when P2 chooses A0 is +2 (and vice versa).

So **C1 modifies the payoff matrix**.

Let’s compute the **effective payoff matrix under C1**.

#### **Payoffs under Contract C1 (from P2's view)**

Remember: payoff = base payoff + contract payment

Let’s write the matrix from **P2's perspective**.

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (+2 from P1) | A1 |
|--------|------------------|----|
| **A0 (+2 from P2)** | (2 + 2, 2 + 2) = (4, 4)   | (0 + 2, 3 + 0) = (2, 3) |
| **A1 (no payment)** | (3 + 0, 0 + 2) = (3, 2)   | (1, 1) |

Wait — need to be careful.

- When P2 chooses A0 → P2 gets +2 (paid by P1)
- When P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +2 (paid by P2)

So:

- (A0, A0):  
  - P1: 2 (base) + 2 (from P2) = 4  
  - P2: 2 (base) + 2 (from P1) = 4

- (A0, A1):  
  - P1: 0 (base) + 0 (no bonus since P1 played A0, but P2 played A1 → P2 doesn't get bonus) → 0  
  - P2: 3 (base) + 0 (since P2 played A1 → no bonus) → 3

Wait — no: P2 played A1 → so **P2 does not get +2** → correct.

But P1 played A0 → so **P1 gets +2 from P2** → yes.

So P1: 0 (base) + 2 = 2  
P2: 3 (base) + 0 = 3

So (2, 3)

- (A1, A0):  
  P1 plays A1 → gets no bonus  
  P2 plays A0 → gets +2 from P1  
  Base: (3, 0)  
  → P1: 3 + 0 = 3  
  → P2: 0 + 2 = 2

- (A1, A1):  
  Both play A1 → no bonus → (1,1)

So matrix (P1 \ P2):

|         | A0   | A1   |
|---------|------|------|
| **A0**  | (4,4) | (2,3) |
| **A1**  | (3,2) | (1,1) |

Now, what is P2’s best response?

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2: A0 → 4, A1 → 3 → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2: A0 → 2, A1 → 1 → prefers A0

So **A0 is strictly dominant for P2** under C1.

Similarly, for P1:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1: A0 → 4, A1 → 3 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1 → P1: A0 → 2, A1 → 1 → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant for P1 too**

Thus, **(A0, A0)** is the unique Nash equilibrium under C1 → **both get 4**

So **P2 gets 4 under C1**, which is better than base game’s 1.

So **C1 benefits me (P2)**.

But we must ask: do I want to **approve** this contract?

Approval means: I believe this contract would **improve my expected payoff**, or at least not hurt me, and I want it to be selected.

But also: only **contracts with maximum approvals** survive — the winning contract is selected **uniformly at random from those with max approvals**.

So to maximize my **chance of getting a good contract**, I should approve contracts that **benefit me**, and only **disapprove** ones that harm me **if I believe they are less likely to get selected**, etc.

But first, evaluate each contract.

---

#### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**

- If a player chooses A0 → no additional payments
- If a player chooses A1 → they **pay an additional 1 point**, **distributed equally among the other players**

So: if I (P2) play A1 → I lose 1 point (to P1)

If P1 plays A1 → P1 loses 1 point (to me)

So this is a **penalty for choosing A1**

Let’s compute the **effective payoff matrix** under C2 (from P2’s view):

Base payoffs + contract penalty

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (no cost) | A1 (pay 1 to P1) |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **A0 (no cost)** | (2, 2)             | (0, 3 - 1) = (0, 2) |
| **A1 (pay 1 to P2)** | (3 - 1, 0) = (2, 0) | (1 - 1, 1 - 1) = (0, 0) |

Breakdown:

- (A0, A0): both get 0 extra → (2,2)
- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 1 point to P1 → so P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2, P1 gets 0 (base) + 1 = 1? Wait — no

Important: **“distributed equally among the other players”**

There is **only one other player**, so if a player plays A1, they pay 1, and that 1 goes **to the other player**.

So:

- P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 1 → P1 receives 1
- P1 plays A1 → P1 pays 1 → P2 receives 1

So:

- (A0, A0): (2,2) → no penalty → still (2,2)
- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 1 → P2 gets 3 (base) - 1 = **2**, P1 gets 0 + 1 = **1**
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → P1 pays 1 → P2 gets 0 + 1 = **1**, P1 gets 3 - 1 = **2**
- (A1, A1): both play A1 → P1 pays 1 to P2, P2 pays 1 to P1 → so net: both lose 1, gain 1 → net 0

So:

|         | A0   | A1   |
|---------|------|------|
| **A0**  | (2,2) | (0,1) |
| **A1**  | (1,2) | (0,0) |

Now, what is P2’s best response?

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2: A0 → 2, A1 → 1 → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2: A0 → 1, A1 → 0 → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant for P2** under C2.

Similarly for P1:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1: A0 → 2, A1 → 1 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1 → P1: A0 → 0, A1 → 0 → indifferent
  - So A0 is weakly dominant

Thus, (A0, A0) is the unique Nash equilibrium? But when P2 plays A1, P1 is indifferent.

But since P2 always plays A0 (strictly dominant), then P1 best response is A0.

So **(A0, A0)** outcome expected → P2 gets **2**

Compare to base game: P2 got 1 → now gets 2 → better.

But wait — is that the only possible equilibrium?

Yes, because both players want to play A0.

So under C2, P2 gets **2 points** (vs. 1 in base game)

But **C1 gives P2 4 points**, **C2 gives P2 2 points**

So **C1 is better for me (P2)**.

But the question is: **should I approve each contract?**

Approval is based on **whether I believe the contract benefits me** — possibly more, but also considering the **approval voting system**.

Recall:

> The winning contract will be selected **uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So my goal is to **maximize my expected payoff**, considering:
- Which contracts I approve
- How many approvals they get
- Then the winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from the most-approved ones

But I **don’t know** how others will vote, but I assume they vote rationally based on their own incentives.

So I need to anticipate others’ approval choices.

But the contracts are proposed by **Player 1 (C1)** and **Player 2 (C2)**.

- C1 is proposed by **Player 1**
- C2 is proposed by **Player 2 (me)**

Now, consider **each contract's effect on the proposer**.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Each Contract from Proposer's Perspective**

#### **C1 (proposed by P1): What does P1 get?**

From earlier: under C1, payoff matrix is:

|         | A0   | A1   |
|---------|------|------|
| **A0**  | (4,4) | (2,3) |
| **A1**  | (3,2) | (1,1) |

So P1’s payoff:
- If (A0,A0): 4
- If (A0,A1): 2
- (A1,A0): 3
- (A1,A1): 1

P1’s dominant strategy: A0
→ P1 will play A0, P2 will play A0 → outcome: (4,4)

So P1 gets 4 under C1.

Compare base game: P1 got 1 → **much better**

So P1 **definitely wants C1 to pass** → so P1 will **approve C1**.

Now, does P2 (me) want it? → We already saw: I get 4 → better than 1 → so I also **want it** → I should approve C1.

#### **C2 (proposed by P2 - me): What does P2 get?**

Under C2, P2 gets 2 in equilibrium → better than 1 → good.

But what about **P1**? Does P1 want C2?

From C2 payoff matrix:

|         | A0   | A1   |
|---------|------|------|
| **A0**  | (2,2) | (0,1) |
| **A1**  | (1,2) | (0,0) |

P1’s payoffs:
- A0: if P2 plays A0 → 2; if P2 plays A1 → 0 → prefers A0
- A1: if P2 plays A0 → 1; if P2 plays A1 → 0 → prefers A0

So P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0 → outcome: (2,2)

→ P1 gets 2 → better than base game (1)

So **P1 benefits from C2 too**.

So P1 will **approve C2**, because it gives them 2 > 1.

Therefore:
- P1 will approve C1 → benefits (4 → 1)
- P1 will approve C2 → benefits (2 → 1)
- I (P2) will approve C1 → I get 4 > 1
- I (P2) will approve C2 → I get 2 > 1

So **both players would approve both contracts**, *if they believe they benefit*, which they do.

But is that true? Wait — **P2 (me)** — I propose C2, and I benefit.

But wait — is **C1 better for me than C2?** Yes: 4 > 2.

So I prefer C1 over C2.

But **approval is not about preference — it's about whether I think the contract benefits me**, and thus I want it to be selected.

But since **both benefit me**, I should approve both.

But here’s a twist: **if I approve only C1**, and P1 approves both, then:
- C1: approved by P1 and me → 2 approvals
- C2: approved by P1 only → 1 approval → loses

So C1 wins.

But if I approve both, then C1 and C2 both have 2 approvals → randomly chosen between them → I get:
- C1 with 50% → payoff 4
- C2 with 50% → payoff 2
→ Expected payoff: $ 0.5 \times 4 + 0.5 \times 2 = 2 + 1 = 3 $

If I **only approve C1**, and P1 also approves C1 (surely), then:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 1 approval
→ C1 wins → I get 4

Better: **4 > 3**

So **I should only approve C1** — because if I approve C2, and if C2 gets equal approvals, then half the time I get only 2.

But P1 will approve both C1 and C2, because both benefit P1.

So total approvals:
- If I approve **only C1**:
  - C1: 2 approvals (P1 and me)
  - C2: 1 approval (P1 only) → loses

Winning contract: C1 → I get 4

- If I approve **both**:
  - C1: 2 approvals
  - C2: 2 approvals
  → Both tied for most approvals → selected uniformly at random → 50% C1, 50% C2
  → My expected payoff: $ 0.5 \times 4 + 0.5 \times 2 = 3 $

- If I **disapprove C1**, approve C2:
  - C1: 1 approval (P1 only) → loses
  - C2: 2 approvals → wins
  → I get 2

Worse than 4.

So **worst case**: I get 2

**Best case**: I get 4

So **strategy ranking**:

- Approve only C1: I get **4** with certainty
- Approve both: I get **3** expected
- Approve only C2: I get **2**

Thus, **optimal for me is to approve only C1**.

But are we sure P1 will approve C2?

P1 benefits from C2: gets 2 instead of 1 → yes, so P1 will approve C2.

Similarly, P1 benefits from C1 → will approve C1.

So **P1 will approve both contracts**.

Therefore, the **only way** for me to guarantee getting 4 is to **approve C1 only**.

If I approve both, there is a 50% chance I get only 2.

So **I should not approve C2**, even though it benefits me, because it **lowers my expected payoff** by introducing a chance of a worse outcome.

Therefore, **I should approve only C1**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To solve this decision-making problem effectively, we need to consider both the basic game rules and the additional points introduced by the payment contract. Let's break it down step by step.

### Basic Game Payoff Analysis
1. **If both choose A0 (A0, A0):** 
   - Payoff: (2, 2)

2. **If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1 (A0, A1):**
   - Payoff: (3, 0)

3. **If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0 (A1, A0):**
   - Payoff: (0, 3)

4. **If both choose A1 (A1, A1):**
   - Payoff: (1, 1)

### Contract Payoff Analysis
The additional 1-point adjustment can change the optimal strategy significantly. Here's how the contract affects each action pair:

1. **(A0, A0):**
   - Both players chose A0, so both receive +1 point.
   - Net Payoff: (3, 3)

2. **(A0, A1):**
   - Player 1 gains +1 from choosing A0, but Player 2 loses 1 for choosing A1.
   - Net Payoff: (3+1, 0-1) = (4, -1)

3. **(A1, A0):**
   - Player 2 gains +1 from choosing A0, but Player 1 loses 1 for choosing A1.
   - Net Payoff: (0-1, 3+1) = (-1, 4)

4. **(A1, A1):**
   - Both lose 1 point additional for choosing A1.
   - Net Payoff: (1-1, 1-1) = (0, 0)

### Strategy Analysis
As Player 2, we aim to maximize our expected points. Let's analyze the net outcomes given these considerations, assuming mixed strategies.

### Expected Payoff Calculation
Suppose we choose action A0 with probability p and action A1 with probability (1-p), and the other player does the same for their actions.

Given the payoffs:
1. **(A0, A0)**: (3, 3)
2. **(A0, A1)**: (4, -1)
3. **(A1, A0)**: (-1, 4)
4. **(A1, A1)**: (0, 0)

Let \( p \) be the probability of Player 2 choosing A0 and \( q \) be the probability of Player 1 choosing A0. The expected payoff for Player 2 is:
\[ E_2 = p \cdot q \cdot 3 + p \cdot (1-q) \cdot (-1) + (1-p) \cdot q \cdot 4 + (1-p) \cdot (1-q) \cdot 0 \]

Simplify this:
\[ E_2 = 3pq - p + pq - 4pq + 4(1-p)q \]
\[ E_2 = 3pq - p + 3pq + 4q - 4pq \]
\[ E_2 = 2pq - p + 4q \]

To maximize \( E_2 \), we need to balance \( q \) and \( p \). Assuming the other player is rational, they will also be optimizing their probabilities.

Given the equilibria in mixed strategies where the payoffs are equally balanced:
Let's use \( p = q \), assuming they distribute their strategies:
\[ 2pq - p + 4q \]

If both adopt a 50-50 strategy (p = 0.5):
\[ 2(0.5)(0.5) - 0.5 + 4(0.5) \]
\[ 0.5 - 0.5 + 2 = 2 \]

### Final Solution
A balanced mixed-strategy approach where each action is chosen with equal probability is optimal given the symmetric nature and contract adjustments.

response:
To determine which contracts to approve, we need to evaluate the impact of each contract on our expected payoff. Let's break down the evaluation process:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understand the Base Game Payoffs:**
    - If both choose A0: Player 2 gets 2 points, Player 1 gets 2 points.
    - If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
    - If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
    - If both choose A1: Player 2 gets 1 point, Player 1 gets 1 point.

2. **Evaluate the Impact of Each Proposed Contract:**

    #### Contract Proposed by Player 1 (C1):
    - If a player chooses A0, they receive 1 additional point, drawn equally from the other player.
    - If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 additional point, distributed equally to the other player.

    With C1 applied, the modified payoffs are:
    - Both choose A0: Player 2 gets \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) points, Player 1 gets \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) points.
    - Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets \( 0 + 1 = 1 \) point, Player 1 gets \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) points.
    - Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) points, Player 1 gets \( 0 + 1 = 1 \) point.
    - Both choose A1: Player 2 gets \( 1 - 1 = 0 \) point, Player 1 gets \( 1 - 1 = 0 \) point.

    #### Contract Proposed by Player 2 (C2):
    - The same as C1, since Player 2 proposed it with the same structure:
    - Both choose A0: Player 2 gets \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) points, Player 1 gets \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) points.
    - Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets \( 0 + 1 = 1 \) point, Player 1 gets \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) points.
    - Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) points, Player 1 gets \( 0 + 1 = 1 \) point.
    - Both choose A1: Player 2 gets \( 1 - 1 = 0 \) point, Player 1 gets \( 1 - 1 = 0 \) point.

Since both contracts are identical, the decision to approve one involves the same reasoning for the other.

### Decision-Making:
1. **Non-Cooperative Payoffs:**
    - Pure strategy Nash Equilibrium for the base game sees both players naturally choosing A1 (since choosing A0 is risky due to the potential higher payoff of A1 against A0), resulting in both receiving 1 point each.
2. **Contract Impact:**
    - Both contracts incentivize choosing A0 by increasing its payoff and penalizing choosing A1. Under these contracts, choosing A0 becomes a dominant strategy.
    - With the contracts, if both players choose A0, both receive 3 points, which is higher than they would receive without the contract.

Therefore, since both contracts result in higher payoffs for Player 2 when compared to the base game, it is in Player 2's best interest to approve both contracts.

### Final Answer:

  "C1": true,
  "C2": true

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game without contract

From my perspective (Player 2), the payoff matrix is:
```
                Other Player (P1)
                A0      A1
Me (P2)   A0    2       0
          A1    3       1
```

In this game:
- If P1 plays A0, I prefer A1 (get 3 vs 2)
- If P1 plays A1, I prefer A1 (get 1 vs 0)

So A1 is my dominant strategy. By symmetry, A1 is also P1's dominant strategy. The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with both players getting **1 point**.

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds a penalty: playing A1 costs 2 points, which goes to the other player.

New payoffs for me (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): 2 + 0 = **2**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 (I receive P1's penalty) = **2**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 (I pay penalty) = **1**
- (A1, A1): 1 - 2 (I pay) + 2 (I receive) = **1**

New payoff matrix:
```
                Other Player (P1)
                A0      A1
Me (P2)   A0    2       2
          A1    1       1
```

Now A0 strictly dominates A1 for me (2 > 1 regardless of opponent's choice).

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → I get **1 point**
- **With contract**: Nash equilibrium (A0, A0) → I get **2 points**

The contract transforms the game into one where cooperation (both playing A0) becomes the dominant strategy equilibrium, increasing my payoff from 1 to 2 points.

## Conclusion

I should sign the contract because it improves my expected payoff.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the payoffs of the game both with and without the contract.

**1. Analyze the original game (without the contract):**
The payoff matrix for the original game is:
- (P1: A0, P2: A0): P1 = 2, P2 = 2
- (P1: A0, P2: A1): P1 = 0, P2 = 3
- (P1: A1, P2: A0): P1 = 3, P2 = 0
- (P1: A1, P2: A1): P1 = 1, P2 = 1

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma. For both players, action A1 is the dominant strategy (it yields a higher payoff regardless of the other player's choice). 
- If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 3 for A1 versus 2 for A0.
- If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 1 for A1 versus 0 for A0.
Thus, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), leading to a payoff of **1 point** for each player.

**2. Analyze the game with the contract:**
The contract specifies:
- Playing A0: Receive 1 point from the other player.
- Playing A1: Pay 1 point to the other player.

Let's calculate the adjusted payoffs if the contract is active (i.e., both players sign):
- **(A0, A0):** Both players receive 1 point and pay 1 point. Net change is 0.
  Payoffs: (2, 2)
- **(A0, A1):** P1 chooses A0 (receives 1 point from P2 and receives 1 point because P2 chose A1). Net change for P1 is +2. P2 chooses A1 (pays 1 point to P1 and loses 1 point because P1 chose A0). Net change for P2 is -2.
  Payoffs: (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1)
- **(A1, A0):** Mirror image of (A0, A1).
  Payoffs: (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2)
- **(A1, A1):** Both players pay 1 point and receive 1 point. Net change is 0.
  Payoffs: (1, 1)

In this modified matrix, A0 is now the dominant strategy for both players:
- If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 2 for A0 versus 1 for A1.
- If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 2 for A0 versus 1 for A1.
The Nash equilibrium in the modified game is (A0, A0), leading to a payoff of **2 points** for each player.

**3. Decision:**
- If you **Sign**: The contract becomes active (since Player 1 proposed it and is likely to sign). The game moves to the modified matrix where the Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0), giving you **2 points**.
- If you **Do Not Sign**: The contract is inactive. The game remains the original Prisoner's Dilemma where the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), giving you **1 point**.

Since 2 points is greater than 1 point, signing the contract is the optimal strategy to maximize your total points.

Both proposed contracts are identical, so I evaluate the incentives under that shared contract.

### 1) Compute the contract’s net transfer (2 players)
- If **I choose A0**: I **receive +1** from the other player.
- If **I choose A1**: I **pay −1** to the other player.

So payments are zero-sum between us.

### 2) New payoffs to me under the contract
Add the transfer effects to the original payoff:

- **(A0, A0)**: original 2, plus **(+1 from other)**, minus **(1 paid to other because they chose A0)** → **2**
- **(A0, A1)**: original 0, plus **(+1 from other for my A0)**, plus **(+1 because they chose A1 and pay me)** → **2**
- **(A1, A0)**: original 3, minus **(1 because I chose A1)**, minus **(1 because they chose A0 and take from me)** → **1**
- **(A1, A1)**: original 1, minus **(1 because I chose A1)**, plus **(+1 because they chose A1 and pay me)** → **1**

So against either opponent action, my payoff is:
- If I play **A0**: I get **2**
- If I play **A1**: I get **1**

Thus **A0 becomes my strictly dominant action**, and symmetrically it becomes dominant for the other player too, leading to **(A0, A0)** with payoff **2 each**. That is better for me than the original game’s dominant-strategy outcome **(A1, A1)** with payoff **1 each**.

### 3) Approval decision
Since both contracts implement the same beneficial incentive shift for me, I approve **both**.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
Both proposed contracts change the incentives so that **A0 becomes a strict dominant action** for each player.

### 1) Baseline (no contract)
Your payoffs vs the other player’s action:

- If you play **A0**: \(2\) (if other A0) or \(0\) (if other A1)
- If you play **A1**: \(3\) (if other A0) or \(1\) (if other A1)

So **A1 strictly dominates A0** (it’s always +1 higher), leading to equilibrium **(A1, A1)** with payoff **1** to you.

---

### 2) Contract C1 (A0: +1, A1: −1; transfers between players)
Compute your net payoff (base payoff + transfers):

- (A0,A0): net transfers cancel → payoff \(2\)
- (A0,A1): you receive 1 (for your A0) + receive 1 (because other paid for A1) → payoff \(0+2=2\)
- (A1,A0): you pay 1 (for your A1) + pay 1 (because other received for A0) → payoff \(3-2=1\)
- (A1,A1): transfers cancel → payoff \(1\)

So under C1, **A0 strictly dominates A1** (2 vs 1), equilibrium **(A0,A0)**, you get **2**.

---

### 3) Contract C2 (A0: +2, A1: 0)
Net payoff:

- (A0,A0): transfers cancel → payoff \(2\)
- (A0,A1): you receive 2 → payoff \(0+2=2\)
- (A1,A0): you pay 2 (because other chose A0) → payoff \(3-2=1\)
- (A1,A1): payoff \(1\)

Again **A0 strictly dominates A1**, equilibrium **(A0,A0)**, you get **2**.

---

### Approval choice
Both C1 and C2 increase your equilibrium payoff from **1 → 2**, and neither is better than the other for you in equilibrium. Approving both maximizes the chance that *some* payoff-improving contract is selected (and never hurts you here).

response:
Both proposed contracts are identical: choosing **A0** gives you a +1 transfer from the other player, and choosing **A1** makes you pay 1 to the other player.

With 2 players, that means the *net* transfer to me depends on both actions:

- (A0, A0): I receive 1 and pay 1 ⇒ net **0**
- (A0, A1): I receive 1 (for my A0) + receive 1 (because other played A1 and pays) ⇒ net **+2**
- (A1, A0): I pay 1 (for my A1) + pay 1 (because other played A0 and I fund it) ⇒ net **−2**
- (A1, A1): I pay 1 and receive 1 ⇒ net **0**

Adding this to my base payoffs makes **A0** strictly/weakly better than **A1** regardless of what the other player does (I get 2 instead of 1 in either case). Symmetrically, it also makes **A0** better for Player 1. So the contract shifts play to (A0, A0), giving both players payoff 2 instead of the original equilibrium (A1, A1) payoff 1.

So I approve both contracts (they’re the same, and approving both maximizes the chance some beneficial contract is selected).

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
Let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine whether it is beneficial for us to sign the contract.

1. **Assess the Original Payoff Matrix:**
    - If both Player 1 and Player 2 choose A0: Player 1 gets 2 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A0, and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A1, and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
    - If both Player 1 and Player 2 choose A1: Player 1 gets 1 point, Player 2 gets 1 point.

2. **Consider the Contract Effect:**
    - If a player chooses A0, they receive 1 additional point from the other player.
    - If a player chooses A1, they give away 1 point to the other player.

3. **Adjusting the Payoff Matrix with the Contract:**
    - If both Player 1 and Player 2 choose A0:
        - Player 1 gets 2 + 1 = 3 points.
        - Player 2 gets 2 + 1 = 3 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A0, and Player 2 chooses A1:
        - Player 1 gets 3 + 1 = 4 points.
        - Player 2 gets 0 - 1 = -1 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A1, and Player 2 chooses A0:
        - Player 1 gets 0 - 1 = -1 points.
        - Player 2 gets 3 + 1 = 4 points.
    - If both Player 1 and Player 2 choose A1:
        - Player 1 gets 1 - 1 = 0 points.
        - Player 2 gets 1 - 1 = 0 points.

4. **Evaluate the Strategic Outcome:**
   - Without the contract, the game's payoff matrix suggests a dominant strategy for Player 2:
        - If Player 1 picks A0, choosing A1 yields 3 points (versus 2 points if Player 2 also chooses A0).
        - If Player 1 picks A1, choosing A1 yields 1 point (versus 0 points if Player 2 picks A0).
   - With the contract:
        - If Player 1 picks A0, choosing A1 yields -1 points (versus 3 points if Player 2 picks A0).
        - If Player 1 picks A1, choosing A1 yields 0 points (versus 4 points if Player 2 picks A0).

5. **Impact on Decision to Sign:**
   - Signing the contract influences the strategic landscape.
   - Without the contract, Player 2 prefers A1 in all cases.
   - With the contract, Player 2 prefers A0, particularly when assuming Player 1 optimizes for their own benefit (convincing them to potentially pick A0 at times for 4 points).

6. **Summarize the Payoff Implications:**
    - By signing the contract each player is incentivized to follow a clear choice for higher payoffs.
        - Both choosing A0 under contract is optimal (each player earns 3 points).
   
Final decision-making should reflect these observations:
- Signing leads to predictable, higher joint payoffs under mutual consent.

Thus, my recommendation:
```json
{"sign": true}
```

response:
Let's break this down step by step to decide whether Player 2 should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

The base game is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 2: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

This is a variant of the "battle of the sexes" or a coordination game with a twist: there's a benefit to being the one who chooses A1 when the other chooses A0, and vice versa.

But importantly, we are Player 2.

We now consider whether to sign a **contract** proposed by Player 1.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

The contract states:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player(s).

So:
- If you choose A0 → you gain +2 points.
- This +2 is “drawn equally from the other player(s)” → since there are 2 players, that means **the other player loses 1 point** for each such transaction.

So:
- If you choose A0 → you gain +2, and Player 1 loses 1.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 → Player 1 gains +2, and you lose 1.
- If you choose A1 → nothing happens.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 → nothing happens.

This is a **transfer** based on action choice:
- Choosing A0 gives you +2, but costs the other player 1 point.
- Choosing A1 has no transfer.

Important: The contract only applies **if both players sign it**. So we need to decide whether to sign, assuming Player 1 has already proposed it.

Our goal: Maximize our *total expected points*.

So we must consider:
1. What happens if we sign?
2. What happens if we don't sign?
3. How does the contract affect the equilibrium and our expected payoff?

We assume that the other player (Player 1) will act rationally and try to maximize their own payoff (which is standard in game theory analysis).

But since we are Player 2, and the other player is proposing the contract, we must consider their likely behavior.

However, note: the contract **only becomes active if both sign**. So we must decide whether **we** sign, which will influence the game.

Let’s analyze both scenarios: signing and not signing.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Payoff Matrix with Contract (Active)

Assume both sign the contract. Then the payoffs change as follows:

The base payoff is modified by the contract transfer:
- Whenever a player chooses A0, they get +2, and the other player loses 1.

So let’s compute the **new payoff matrix** when the contract is active.

We compute for each outcome:

#### (A0, A0):
- Base: (2, 2)
- Both chose A0 → each gets +2, but each pays 1 to the other → net: +2 − 1 = +1 for each.
- So new payoff: (2 + 1, 2 + 1) = **(3, 3)**

Wait, more carefully: The contract says you gain +2 **if you choose A0**, and the payment is drawn from the other player(s) — so if both choose A0:
- You get +2 (from contract)
- You lose 1 to Player 1 (because Player 1 chose A0 → they get +2, so you pay 1)
- So net: +2 − 1 = +1
- Same for Player 1: +2 − 1 = +1
- So total: (2 + 1, 2 + 1) = (3, 3)

#### (A0, A1):
- Base: (0, 3)
- You chose A0 → you get +2
- Player 1 chose A1 → no contract gain or loss
- So you get +2 (from contract), no loss
- Player 1 gets nothing from contract
- But: you receive +2 from contract, and since Player 1 didn’t choose A0, you don't pay anything
- So your total: 0 (base) + 2 = **2**
- Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 = **3**
- So payoff: (2, 3)

Wait — but the contract says: “drawn equally from the other players” — so only **when a player chooses A0** does it draw payment from the other. So:
- You chose A0 → you get +2 → from *your* choice — it comes from the other player.
- So you gain +2, and Player 1 must pay you 1? Wait.

Let’s clarify the contract wording:

> “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.”

“Drawn equally from the other players” → so if only one other player, the entire 2 points are drawn *from* them.

But **who pays and who receives**?

Key point: If **you** choose A0 → you gain 2 points → the other player(s) must pay 2 points (since there's only one other player).

But the phrase “drawn equally from the other players” suggests that if there were multiple players, the cost is shared. Here, only one other player, so the **entire 2 points are taken from the other player**.

So if you choose A0 → you gain +2, and the other player loses 2.

But wait — that can’t be, because that would mean choosing A0 gives you +2, but subtracts 2 from the other player — so net transfer of +2 to you.

But the phrase says: “drawn equally from the other players” → implying the cost is shared.

But in a 2-player game, “equally” from other players → 1 each? But there's only one other player → so full 2 points from that one player?

That's ambiguous.

But likely interpretation: **Each time a player plays A0, they gain +2, and that 2 points is entirely taken from the other player(s)**.

So it's a direct transfer:
- Player who plays A0 → +2
- Other player(s) → −2

But that would mean if both play A0, each gains +2 and loses 2 (to the other) → net: 0 change? That contradicts previous.

Wait — let's think carefully.

Suppose:
- You play A0 → you get +2
- That +2 comes from the other player(s)

But if the other player also plays A0 → then they get +2, which comes from you.

So both players get +2 from their own action, but pay 2 to the other.

So net: +2 − 2 = 0 for each.

But then why say “drawn equally from the other players”? That suggests the cost is shared.

Ah — here’s a better interpretation:

The contract might be structured such that **all A0 players collectively receive a bonus of 2 points per A0 vote, and that bonus is paid by the other players**.

But in this case, there are only two players.

So:
- Each time a player chooses A0, they receive +2.
- This +2 is drawn **from the other player** — so if only one player chooses A0, they get +2, and the other loses 2.
- If both choose A0, then:
  - You receive +2 (from contract)
  - Player 1 receives +2 (from contract)
  - Who pays? The bonus is drawn from the other players.
  - So:
    - You need to pay 2 (because Player 1 chose A0 → you must pay 2)
    - Player 1 must pay 2 (because you chose A0 → Player 1 pays 2)
    - So you gain +2 (from A0) and lose 2 (to Player 1) → net 0
    - Same for Player 1 → net 0
  - So no net gain or loss from contract in (A0,A0)

But that seems odd — why announce the contract then?

Alternatively, perhaps the contract is interpreted as:

> Each player who chooses A0 gets a bonus of 2 points from a central pool, which is funded by the other players.

So:
- If only you play A0: you get +2, Player 1 loses 2 → net transfer +2 to you
- If only Player 1 plays A0: you lose 2, they gain 2
- If both play A0: both get +2, both pay 2 → net 0

This interpretation is consistent with "drawn equally from other players" — but if both play A0, then you both lose 2 (to fund the bonuses) → net 0.

Yes, that makes sense.

So contract mechanics:
- **Each player receives +2 for playing A0**, paid from the **other players**.

So:
- If you play A0, you get +2
- But you must pay 2 if **the other player plays A0** (because their A0 draws from you)
- So net: +2 − (2 if other plays A0)

Similarly for Player 1.

So in general, for a player who chooses A0:
- Contract gain = +2
- Contract loss = 2 × (indicator that the other player chose A0)

So net contract effect: +2 − 2 × I(other chose A0)

Similarly, if you choose A1:
- No contract gain or loss.

So let’s now recompute the **actual payoffs under contract**, combining base payoff and contract effects.

We'll write the new payoff matrix (Player 2's perspective, rows: A0, A1; columns: A0, A1):

---

#### Case 1: (A0, A0)
- Base: (2, 2)
- Player 2 (you):
  - Base: 2
  - Contract: +2 (because you chose A0) − 2 (because Player 1 chose A0) = 0
  - Total: 2 + 0 = **2**
- Player 1:
  - Base: 2
  - Contract: +2 − 2 = 0
  - Total: 2
- So: (2, 2)

Wait — but both players get +2 from contract but lose 2 to the other → net 0 → so base payoffs unchanged.

So (A0, A0) remains (2, 2)

#### Case 2: (A0, A1)
- Base: you get 0, Player 1 gets 3
- You chose A0:
  - Contract: +2 (from A0), −2 (because Player 1 chose A1 → no draw from you) → so only +2, no loss
  - So contract gain: +2
  - Total: 0 + 2 = **2**
- Player 1 chose A1:
  - Contract: no gain, no loss
  - Base: 3 → total: 3
- So payoff: **(2, 3)**

#### Case 3: (A1, A0)
- Base: you get 3, Player 1 gets 0
- You chose A1:
  - Contract: no gain, no loss
  - So total: 3
- Player 1 chose A0:
  - Contract: +2, but -2 if you chose A0 → you chose A1 → so no loss
  - So Player 1 gets +2 from contract
  - Base: 0 → total: 0 + 2 = 2
- So payoff: **(3, 2)**

#### Case 4: (A1, A1)
- Base: (1, 1)
- Both chose A1 → no contract effect
- So: (1, 1)

### Summary: Payoff Matrix with Contract Active

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P2: A0**    | (2,2) | (2,3) |
| **P2: A1**    | (3,2) | (1,1) |

Now, compare to original:

Original:
|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P2: A0**    | (2,2) | (0,3) |
| **P2: A1**    | (3,0) | (1,1) |

So with contract:
- (A0,A0): same
- (A0,A1): you go from 0 to 2 — better
- (A1,A0): you go from 3 to 3 — same
- (A1,A1): same

So you **gain** in one case (when you play A0 and they play A1), and are unchanged otherwise.

But crucially, your **strategic incentives** have changed.

Let’s now analyze what happens in equilibrium.

---

### Step 4: Analyze Player 2’s Incentives with Contract

We are Player 2, and we must decide whether to sign the contract.

But **to assess the contract**, we need to:
1. Consider what happens if we sign (contract active)
2. Compare expected payoff under contract vs. without contract
3. We must assume Player 1 will also play rationally (based on their own payoffs)

But note: Player 1 proposed the contract, so they likely think it benefits them, but we can't assume they will sign unless it's beneficial.

However, since it's a **minimum of agreement** (everyone must sign), and we are evaluating whether **we** sign, we need to consider whether **both** will sign — but we don’t know that.

But the question is: **"you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract."**

So we must decide based on our own expected payoff, under the assumption that **Player 1 will sign only if they expect to gain from signing**.

But the contract is only active if both sign.

So we must ask:

- If I sign, will Player 1 sign?
- If yes, then we get the contract payoffs.
- If not, then we get the base game.

So we must simulate the game under both conditions.

Let’s proceed with game-theoretic reasoning.

---

### Step 5: Game Without Contract (Base Game)

Payoff matrix (Player 2):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P2: A0**    | (2,2) | (0,3) |
| **P2: A1**    | (3,0) | (1,1) |

This is a **non-zero-sum** game.

Let’s find Nash equilibria (pure and mixed).

#### Pure Strategy Equilibria:

- (A0, A0): (2,2). If P2 deviates to A1: gets 3 > 2 → P2 wants to deviate → not equilibrium
- (A0, A1): (0,3). P1: A1 → if P1 deviates to A0, gets 2 < 3 → P1 won’t deviate. P2: currently gets 0, if deviates to A1 → gets 1 > 0 → P2 wants to deviate → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): (3,0). P2: gets 3, if switches to A0 → gets 2 < 3 → won’t deviate. P1: gets 0, if switches to A1 → gets 1 > 0 → wants to deviate → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): (1,1). P2: gets 1, if deviates to A0 → gets 0 < 1 → won’t deviate. P1: gets 1, if deviates to A0 → gets 2 > 1 → wants to deviate → not equilibrium.

So **no pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Now look for **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Let:
- P1 plays A0 with probability p
- P2 plays A0 with probability q

We solve for q such that P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.
(Then we can find q that makes P1 indifferent, and vice versa.)

But since we’re Player 2, we care about our own expected payoff.

But to evaluate the contract, we need to predict the likely outcome — so we’ll assume both players play optimally.

So compute best response.

#### P2's best response to P1's strategy:

P2’s expected payoff if play A0:
- With prob p: P1 plays A0 → get 2
- With prob (1−p): P1 plays A1 → get 0
- So: EU(A0) = 2p + 0(1−p) = 2p

P2’s expected payoff if play A1:
- With prob p: get 3
- With prob (1−p): get 1
- So: EU(A1) = 3p + 1(1−p) = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1

Set equal to find indifference:
2p = 2p + 1 → 0 = 1 → impossible.

So: EU(A1) = 2p + 1 > 2p = EU(A0) for all p.

So **P2 always prefers A1, regardless of p**?

Wait — that can’t be.

Wait: EU(A0) = 2p
EU(A1) = 3p + 1(1−p) = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1

Compare: 2p + 1 > 2p → yes, always.

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2**.

So **Player 2 will always play A1 in equilibrium**, regardless of what Player 1 does.

But is that right?

Check:

- If P1 plays A0 with high p → your EU(A0) = 2p
- EU(A1) = 2p + 1 → always better

- If p = 0: EU(A0) = 0, EU(A1) = 1 → still better

So yes — **A1 dominates A0 for Player 2**.

So in **any equilibrium**, Player 2 will play A1 with probability 1.

Now, P1’s best response?

P1 knows P2 plays A1 → so P1's choices:

- If P1 plays A0: gets 0 (because P2 plays A1 → base payoff is 0 for P1)
- If P1 plays A1: gets 1

So better to play A1 → gets 1 > 0

So P1 will play A1.

Thus, **unique Nash equilibrium**: both play A1 → payoff (1,1)

So in base game, **expected payoff is 1 for me (Player 2)**.

This is **key**.

Even though there are no pure strategy equilibria, the existence of a strictly dominant strategy (A1 for Player 2) leads to (A1, A1) outcome.

So **without contract**, you get **1 point**.

---

### Step 6: Game with Contract (if signed)

Now, payoff matrix (for Player 2):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P2: A0**    | (2,2) | (2,3) |
| **P2: A1**    | (3,2) | (1,1) |

Now, look for Player 2’s best response.

EU(A0): 2p + 0×(1−p) = 2p → wait no:

- If P1 plays A0 with prob p: then A0 yields 2
- If P1 plays A1 with prob 1−p: then A0 yields 2 (from earlier calculation: (A0,A1) → (2,3) → you get 2)

So EU(A0) = 2p + 2(1−p) = 2

EU(A1) = 3p + 1(1−p) = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1

Now, compare:
- EU(A0) = 2
- EU(A1) = 2p + 1

Set equal: 2 = 2p + 1 → 2p = 1 → p = 0.5

- If p > 0.5: 2p + 1 > 2 → EU(A1) > EU(A0)
- If p < 0.5: 2p + 1 < 2 → EU(A1) < EU(A0)
- If p = 0.5: both are 2

So Player 2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0 with p > 0.5 → prefer A1
- If p < 0.5 → prefer A0
- If p = 0.5 → indifferent

Now, what about P1?

P1 wants to maximize their own payoff.

P1's payoffs:
- If play A0: gets 2 (if P2 plays A0), gets 2 (if P2 plays A1)
- So EU(A0) = 2×q + 2×(1−q) = 2

- If play A1: gets 3 (if P2 plays A0), gets 1 (if P2 plays A1)
- EU(A1) = 3q + 1(1−q) = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1

Set equal: 2 = 2q + 1 → q = 0.5

So:
- If q > 0.5: 2q + 1 > 2 → prefer A1
- If q < 0.5: prefer A0
- If q = 0.5: indifferent

Now, look for Nash equilibrium.

Suppose q = 0.5 (Player 2 plays A0 with 50%)

Then P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 → can play any mix.

But we want an equilibrium.

Try q = 0.5, p = 0.5.

Check:
- Player 2: EU(A0) = 2, EU(A1) = 2(0.5) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 → indifferent → so playing q = 0.5 is best response
- Player 1: EU(A0) = 2, EU(A1) = 2(0.5) + 1 = 2 → indifferent → so p = 0.5 is best response

So **(p=0.5, q=0.5) is a Nash equilibrium**.

Are there others?

Suppose P1 plays pure A0 → p=1

Then P2: EU(A0) = 2, EU(A1) = 2(1) + 1 = 3 → so prefers A1 → so q=1

But if q=1, then P1: EU(A0) = 2, EU(A1) = 2(1)+1 = 3 → prefers A1 → contradiction

If p=0, then P2: EU(A0)=2, EU(A1)=0+1=1 → prefers A0 → q=1

But if q=1, P1 prefers A1 → so p must be >0 → contradiction

So only equilibrium is (0.5, 0.5)

So in the contract game, **equilibrium is both play A0 with 50%**, A1 with 50%

Now compute **expected payoff for Player 2**:

- With prob 0.5: P1 plays A0
  - With prob 0.5: you play A0 → get 2
  - With prob 0.5: you play A1 → get 3
  → So conditional: 0.5×2 + 0.5×3 = 1 + 1.5 = 2.5
- With prob 0.5: P1 plays A1
  - With prob 0.5: you play A0 → get 2
  - With prob 0.5: you play A1 → get 1
  → 0.5×2 + 0.5×1 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5

Total expected payoff: 0.5×2.5 + 0.5×1.5 = 1.25 + 0.75 = **2.0**

So if both sign the contract, your **expected payoff is 2.0**

---

### Step 7: Compare Signing vs Not Signing

- If you do **not** sign the contract → game remains base game → expected payoff: **1.0**
- If you **sign** the contract → and assuming Player 1 also signs (since they proposed it, and it benefits them too), then expected payoff: **2.0**

So you **gain** by signing.

But: Will Player 1 sign?

Let’s check Player 1’s payoff under contract.

In equilibrium (p=0.5, q=0.5):

Player 1’s expected payoff:

- With prob 0.5: P2 plays A0 → P1’s payoff if:
  - P1 plays A0: 2
  - P1 plays A1: 3
- With prob 0.5: P2 plays A1 → P1’s payoff if:
  - P1 plays A0: 2
  - P1 plays A1: 1

So P1’s expected payoff:

- Exp: 0.5×[0.5×2 + 0.5×3] + 0.5×[0.5×2 + 0.5×1] = 0.5×[1 + 1.5] + 0.5×[1 + 0.5] = 0.5×2.5 + 0.5×1.5 = 1.25 + 0.75 = **2.0**

Without contract, P1’s payoff was 1.0 → so **Player 1 also gains**.

So Player 1 has incentive to sign.

Therefore, **both will sign**.

Thus, if you sign, you get **2.0**, instead of **1.0**.

So you should sign.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
Let's take a step-by-step approach to determining the optimal strategy for Player 2 in this game.

### 1. Understanding the Payoffs
#### Without Payment Contract:
- **Both choose A0**:
  - Player 2: 2 points
  - Player 1: 2 points
- **Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0**:
  - Player 2: 0 points
  - Player 1: 3 points
- **Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1**:
  - Player 2: 3 points
  - Player 1: 0 points
- **Both choose A1**:
  - Player 2: 1 point
  - Player 1: 1 point

#### With Payment Contract:
- **Both choose A0**:
  - Player 2: 2 points + 1 point (bonus) = 3 points
  - Player 1: 2 points + 1 point (bonus) = 3 points
- **Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0**:
  - Player 2: 0 points + 1 point (bonus) = 1 point
  - Player 1: 3 points - 1 point (penalty) = 2 points
- **Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1**:
  - Player 2: 3 points - 1 point (penalty) = 2 points
  - Player 1: 0 points + 1 point (bonus) = 1 point
- **Both choose A1**:
  - Player 2: 1 point - 1 point (penalty) = 0 points
  - Player 1: 1 point - 1 point (penalty) = 0 points

### 2. Analyzing Strategies
Considering the payment contract:
- **Both players choosing A0 (3 points each)** is better than any other outcome.
- Player 2 choosing A1 and Player 1 choosing A0 results in 2 points for Player 2 and 1 point for Player 1.
- Player 2 choosing A0 and Player 1 choosing A1 results in 1 point for Player 2 and 2 points for Player 1.
- **Both choosing A1 (0 points each)** is the worst outcome.

### 3. Conclusion and Optimal Strategy
Given the nature of these payoffs, both players should ideally aim for the (A0, A0) combination that maximizes individual and collective payoffs under the contract terms.

Thus, the best strategy for Player 2, considering the contract, is to maximize the probability of choosing A0.

### Final Decision
Player 2 should exclusively choose A0 to maximize their points.

Here is the JSON object reflecting the final decision:
```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

This approach guarantees that Player 2 always opts for the action that maximizes their total points given the contract's influence on the game's payoffs.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal probability distribution over actions A0 and A1 for **Player 2**, given the **contract** and the **payoff structure**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

The standard game is a symmetric version of a coordination/battle-of-the-sexes-like game. The base payoffs (before contract) are:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| A0                   | (2, 2)   | (0, 3)   |
| A1                   | (3, 0)   | (1, 1)   |

This is **not** a zero-sum game. It has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 2
- (A1, A1): both get 1

And a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

But we are not just playing the base game — there is a **contract** in place.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

> **Contract (approved by Player 1):**
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional +2 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

This means:
- When **you (Player 2)** choose A0: you get **+2 points**, and **Player 1 pays 2 points to you**, so **you gain 2, Player 1 loses 2**.
- When **Player 1** chooses A0: same — Player 1 gets +2 from you (i.e., you pay them 2), so **you lose 2**, Player 1 gains 2.
- If **you choose A1**: no additional payment.
- If **Player 1 chooses A1**: no additional payment.

> So **the contract adds an external transfer** that **depends on each player's action**.

---

### **Step 3: Compute the total payoff (including contract)**

Let’s define the **total payoff** for **Player 2**, including contract effects.

Let’s denote:
- Base payoff: from the table above.
- Contract adjustment: +2 if you choose A0 (paid by Player 1).
- But **Player 1** also gets +2 if **they** choose A0, so **you lose 2** in that case.

So the **total payoff for Player 2** is:

> Total Payoff = Base Payoff + (2 if you choose A0) + (–2 if Player 1 chooses A0)

Similarly, for Player 1:
> Total Payoff = Base Payoff + (2 if they choose A0) + (–2 if you choose A0)

Now, let’s compute the **joint payoff** for all four combinations, including contract.

---

### **Step 4: Compute full payoff matrix for Player 2 (you)**

We will compute the **total payoff for Player 2**, including contract effects.

Let’s tabulate:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1)        | A1 (P1)        |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **A0 (P2)** | Base: (2, 2) → P2: 2<br>+2 (you chose A0)<br>–2 (P1 chose A0)<br>→ **2 + 2 – 2 = 2** | Base: (0, 3) → P2: 0<br>+2 (you chose A0)<br>–0 (P1 chose A1) → **0 + 2 = 2** |
| **A1 (P2)** | Base: (3, 0) → P2: 3<br>+0 (you chose A1)<br>–2 (P1 chose A0) → **3 – 2 = 1** | Base: (1, 1) → P2: 1<br>+0 (you chose A1)<br>–0 (P1 chose A1) → **1 + 0 = 1** |

So the **effective payoff matrix for Player 2** is:

| P2 \ P1 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| A0      | **2**    | **2**    |
| A1      | **1**    | **1**    |

Wait! This is interesting.

No matter what **Player 1** does, **Player 2 gets 2 if they choose A0**, and **1 if they choose A1**.

So **A0 dominates A1** for Player 2!

Let’s verify:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 A0: 2 (base 2) +2 (contract) –2 (P1’s A0) = 2
  - P2 A1: 3 (base 3) –2 (P1’s A0) = 1 → so A0 better.

- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 A0: 0 (base) +2 (contract) –0 = 2
  - P2 A1: 1 (base 1) –0 = 1 → so A0 better.

So **regardless** of what Player 1 does, **A0 gives you 2, A1 gives you 1**.

Thus, **A0 is strictly dominant** for Player 2.

So, **no matter what Player 1 does, you should always pick A0**.

Even in mixed strategies, since A0 yields strictly higher payoff in every case, there is **no incentive** to randomize.

---

### **Step 5: Is this really correct? Let’s double-check the contract logic**

Contract:  
- If **you (P2)** choose A0 → you gain +2.
- This +2 is **drawn equally from the other player** → so **Player 1 loses 2**.

Similarly, if **Player 1** chooses A0 → **they gain +2**, and **you lose 2**.

So in the case:
- P2: A0, P1: A0 → P2 gets base 2 +2 (contract) –2 (P1’s A0) = **2**
- P2: A0, P1: A1 → P2 gets base 0 +2 –0 = **2**
- P2: A1, P1: A0 → P2 gets base 3 +0 –2 = **1**
- P2: A1, P1: A1 → P2 gets base 1 +0 –0 = **1**

Yes, confirmed.

So **Player 2 receives 2 for A0, 1 for A1, no matter what Player 1 does.**

Hence, **A0 is strictly dominant.**

---

### **Step 6: Optimal strategy for Player 2**

Because **A0 always gives a higher total payoff (2) than A1 (1)**, regardless of Player 1’s action, the optimal strategy is to **always choose A0**.

So your probability distribution should be:

- A0: 100%
- A1: 0%

---

### **Step 7: Final Answer Format**

We must return a JSON object with integer percentages, summing to 100.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:

response:
Both proposed contracts (C1 and C2) change incentives so that **A0 becomes a strictly dominant action for me (Player 1)**, and it is also **strictly dominant for Player 2**. Therefore, under either contract the unique outcome after the contract is chosen is **(A0, A0)**, giving me **2 points**.

- **Under C1**, my payoffs become:
  - (A0,A0)=2, (A0,A1)=2, (A1,A0)=1, (A1,A1)=1 ⇒ A0 strictly dominates A1 for me.
- **Under C2**, my payoffs become:
  - (A0,A0)=2, (A0,A1)=2, (A1,A0)=1, (A1,A1)=1 ⇒ A0 strictly dominates A1 for me.

So **from my perspective, C1 and C2 are equivalent** in the induced equilibrium payoff (2). Since approving/disapproving doesn’t improve my expected payoff relative to the other contract, I’ll approve both.

response:
Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the basic payoff structure
Without the contract, this is a typical prisoner's dilemma where:
- (A0, A0): I get 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 1

## Step 2: Apply the contract modifications
The contract states that if a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points to the other player.

Let me recalculate my payoffs WITH the contract:

- **(My A0, Other A0)**: 2 + 0 = **2** (no contract payments)
- **(My A0, Other A1)**: 0 + 2 = **2** (other pays me 2 for choosing A1)
- **(My A1, Other A0)**: 3 - 2 = **1** (I pay 2 for choosing A1)
- **(My A1, Other A1)**: 1 - 2 + 2 = **1** (we both pay 2 to each other)

## Step 3: Analyze the modified game matrix

Modified payoff matrix (My payoff, Other's payoff):
```
              Other A0    Other A1
My A0         (2, 2)      (2, 1)
My A1         (1, 2)      (1, 1)
```

## Step 4: Find my best response
- If other plays **A0**: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays **A1**: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - I always get 2 from A0 regardless of what the other player does, while A1 only gives me 1.

## Step 5: Verify rationality
The other player faces the same payoff structure, so A0 is also their dominant strategy. The Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) with payoffs (2, 2).

## Conclusion
The contract (which I proposed as Player 2) effectively transforms the game by penalizing A1, making cooperation (A0) the dominant strategy for both players. This achieves the socially optimal outcome.

My optimal strategy is to play A0 with certainty.

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

This is a simultaneous-move game with two players. Each chooses action A0 or A1, and payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0     | A1     |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0**                      | 2,2    | 0,3    |
| **A1**                      | 3,0    | 1,1    |

This is a classic coordination game with a twist: there are two symmetric Nash equilibria in pure strategies:
- Both play A0 → (2,2)
- Both play A1 → (1,1)

But note: if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0 and they get 3 — so you’re worse off.
If you play A1 and they play A0, you get 3 and they get 0 — you benefit.

So A1 is a "best response" to A0, and A0 is a best response to A1? Let's verify:

- If other plays A0:
  - Your best response: A1 → 3 > 2
- If other plays A1:
  - Your best response: A1 → 1 > 0

Wait — so the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, where both get 1.

But what about mixed strategies?

Let’s compute the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- p = probability you play A0
- q = probability other player plays A0

You are Player 2. You want to maximize your expected payoff.

Your expected payoff if you play A0:
= q × 2 + (1−q) × 0 = 2q

Your expected payoff if you play A1:
= q × 3 + (1−q) × 1 = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1

Set them equal for indifference (in equilibrium, your mixed strategy makes the other indifferent):

2q = 2q + 1 → 0 = 1 → impossible.

So no such q makes you indifferent? Wait — actually, we're solving for the other player’s strategy that makes you indifferent.

Wait — for a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we assume that the other player is mixing in such a way that **you are indifferent** between A0 and A1.

So: set your expected payoff from A0 = expected payoff from A1.

We already have:
- EU(A0) = 2q
- EU(A1) = 3q + 1(1−q) = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1

Set equal:
2q = 2q + 1 → 0 = 1 → contradiction.

That means, **no matter what q is**, EU(A1) > EU(A0). Because 2q + 1 > 2q for all q.

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for you** — regardless of what the other player does.

Similarly, check symmetrically for the other player:
- If you play A0 with prob p, other’s EU(A0) = 2p + 0(1−p) = 2p
- EU(A1) = 3(1−p) + 1p = 3 − 3p + p = 3 − 2p

Set equal: 2p = 3 − 2p → 4p = 3 → p = 0.75

So for the other player to be indifferent, you must play A0 with p = 0.75

But if you always play A1 (p=0), EU(A1) = 3 − 2(0) = 3; EU(A0) = 0 → so A1 still better.

Conclusion: **A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players**.

So in the base game, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoff (1,1).

Even though (A0, A0) gives higher payoffs (2,2), it is not stable — each player has an incentive to deviate to A1.

So without contract, rational players will play A1 → both get 1.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

The contract says:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 2 points**, **drawn equally from the other player**.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payment.

Important: The **2 points are taken from the other player**. That is, the contract creates a penalty for the other player when you choose A0.

Let’s recompute payoffs **with the contract**, assuming **you sign it**.

Note: The contract only activates if **both players sign it**. So you must decide whether to sign, knowing that if you do, and the other player doesn't, the contract is **not activated**.

But — Player 1 (the proposer) has already proposed this contract. We are Player 2. We need to decide whether to sign it. The contract requires **both** to sign to be active.

So outcomes depend on whether the other player signs too.

But the problem says: *"the contract was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1)"* — so it’s implied that **Player 1 has already approved** (i.e., signed), and now **you** must decide whether to sign.

But: approval voting means players can approve or disapprove. If you don’t sign, the contract doesn’t activate. So only if **both** sign is it active.

So: we need to evaluate whether to sign, **given that Player 1 has already signed**, thus the contract will only be active if **you also sign**.

So our decision is: sign or not?

Let’s compute expected payoffs under two scenarios:

---

### **Scenario A: You sign the contract → contract is active**

Now, the actions A0 and A1 lead to **adjusted payoffs** due to the contract.

Let’s define the **total payoff** (game payoff + contract adjustment).

For both players, when a player plays A0, they get:
- +2 from contract
- But this 2 points are **taken from the other player** → so the other player’s payoff is reduced by 2

When a player plays A1: no extra payment.

So let’s write the **new payoff matrix (with contract active)**:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0                | A1                |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **A0**                        | (2 + 2, 2 − 2) = (4, 0) | (0 + 2, 3 − 2) = (2, 1) |
| **A1**                        | (3 − 2, 0 + 2) = (1, 2) | (1, 1)           |

Explanation:
- If you play A0, you get +2, other player loses 2 → subtract 2 from their payoff.
- If you play A1, no contract bonus → payoff unchanged.

So new payoffs:

- (A0, A0): you get 2 (base) + 2 (contract) = 4; other gets 2 (base) − 2 (loss) = 0
- (A0, A1): you get 0 (base) + 2 = 2; other gets 3 (base) − 2 = 1
- (A1, A0): you get 3 (base) − 2 = 1; other gets 0 (base) + 2 = 2
- (A1, A1): no contract effect → (1,1)

So the **new game matrix (with contract active)** is:

|               | A0   | A1   |
|---------------|------|------|
| **A0**        | 4,0  | 2,1  |
| **A1**        | 1,2  | 1,1  |

Now: what is the optimal strategy in this new game?

Check best responses.

Your payoffs:
- If other plays A0:
  - A0: 4
  - A1: 1 → so best response: A0
- If other plays A1:
  - A0: 2
  - A1: 1 → so best response: A0

So **A0 is strictly dominant for you**, no matter what the other player does.

Similarly, check for the other player:

Their payoffs:
- If you play A0:
  - They get 0 (if they play A0) or 1 (if they play A1) → best response: A1
- If you play A1:
  - They get 2 (if A0), 1 (if A1) → best response: A0

So their best response depends on your action.

But now: you are playing A0 **no matter what**.

So the other player knows that — so they will choose A1 (since 1 > 0).

But wait: if you always play A0, and they play A1 → you get 2, they get 1.

But from your perspective: you want to maximize your own payoff.

So in this new game, you can guarantee yourself **at least 2 points** by playing A0, regardless of what the other player does.

- If other plays A0 → you get 4
- If other plays A1 → you get 2

So minimum you get is 2.

If you play A1, you get:
- If other plays A0 → 1
- If other plays A1 → 1

So max you get is 1.

So clearly, **A0 is strictly better** for you.

But the other player may not cooperate. They are self-interested.

But since you are playing A0, and they know your payoff structure, what will they do?

They will choose their best response to your A0.

If you play A0, their payoff:
- A0: 0
- A1: 1 → so they will play A1

So outcome: you play A0, they play A1 → **you get 2**, they get 1

But if you play A0 and they play A0 → you get 4, they get 0

But they won’t play A0 if you play A0 — because 0 < 1

So if you play A0, they play A1 → you get 2

Can you do better?

Only if you could force them to play A0 — but they won’t.

What if you play A1?

Then if they play A0 → you get 1
If they play A1 → you get 1 → so you get 1

So worse than 2.

Therefore, in the **contract-activated** game, **your optimal strategy is to play A0**, and then the other player plays A1 (since it's better for them), giving you 2 points.

So if you **sign the contract**, and play optimally, you get **2 points**.

Wait — but is that the only outcome?

Actually, in equilibrium, what do we expect?

You are playing A0 (dominant), other player best responds to A0 by playing A1.

So (A0, A1) → you get 2.

Could there be a Nash equilibrium where both play A0?

Only if the other player thinks you will play A0, and if they believe that, A0 gives them 0, A1 gives them 1 → so they play A1.

So (A0, A0) is not a Nash equilibrium.

(A1, A1) → you play A1 → you get 1; they get 1

But you can get 2 by playing A0.

So (A0, A1) is the only equilibrium when contract is active.

You get **2**.

---

### **Scenario B: You do NOT sign the contract → contract is inactive**

Then the game goes back to the original.

As established earlier: **A1 strictly dominates A0** for both players.

Because:
- If other plays A0:
  - You get 3 by A1 vs 2 by A0 → prefer A1
- If other plays A1:
  - You get 1 by A1 vs 0 by A0 → prefer A1

So in the base game, the only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) → you get **1 point**.

Even if you could coordinate on (A0, A0), but since it's not stable (each wants to deviate), rational players won't play it.

So **without contract**, you get **1 point**.

---

### **Comparison**

- If you **sign** the contract: you get **2 points** (by playing A0, other plays A1 due to incentives)
- If you **do not sign** the contract: you get **1 point** (in equilibrium)

So **you are better off signing**.

But wait — is there any risk?

Only if the mutual structure changes — but note: the other player has **already signed**, per the setup.

So if you sign, the contract activates → you get 2.

If you don't sign, contract doesn't activate → you get 1.

No matter what, the other player is rational and will play optimally.

So your payoff is 2 if you sign, 1 if you don’t.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
The game is a variation of the Prisoner's Dilemma, transformed by a contract that reallocates points based on the players' actions. To find the optimal strategy, let's break down the adjusted payoffs after the contract's effects are applied.

**1. Analyze the Original Payoffs (Player 2, Player 1):**
*   (A0, A0): 2, 2
*   (A0, A1): 0, 3 (P2 gets 0, P1 gets 3)
*   (A1, A0): 3, 0 (P2 gets 3, P1 gets 0)
*   (A1, A1): 1, 1

**2. Apply the Contract Rules:**
*   Choosing A0 grants the player +1 point and deducts 1 point from the other player.
*   Choosing A1 deducts 1 point from the player and grants the other player +1 point.

**3. Calculate Adjusted Payoffs (Player 2, Player 1):**
*   **Both choose A0:**
    *   P2 payoff: 2 (base) + 1 (P2's A0) - 1 (P1's A0) = 2
    *   P1 payoff: 2 (base) + 1 (P1's A0) - 1 (P2's A0) = 2
    *   **Result: (2, 2)**
*   **P2 chooses A0, P1 chooses A1:**
    *   P2 payoff: 0 (base) + 1 (P2's A0) + 1 (P1's A1) = 2
    *   P1 payoff: 3 (base) - 1 (P1's A1) - 1 (P2's A0) = 1
    *   **Result: (2, 1)**
*   **P2 chooses A1, P1 chooses A0:**
    *   P2 payoff: 3 (base) - 1 (P2's A1) - 1 (P1's A0) = 1
    *   P1 payoff: 0 (base) + 1 (P1's A0) + 1 (P2's A1) = 2
    *   **Result: (1, 2)**
*   **Both choose A1:**
    *   P2 payoff: 1 (base) - 1 (P2's A1) + 1 (P1's A1) = 1
    *   P1 payoff: 1 (base) - 1 (P1's A1) + 1 (P2's A1) = 1
    *   **Result: (1, 1)**

**4. Determine the Optimal Strategy:**
In the adjusted payoff matrix, Player 2's options are:
*   Action A0: Yields 2 points regardless of whether P1 chooses A0 or A1.
*   Action A1: Yields 1 point regardless of whether P1 chooses A0 or A1.

Since 2 points is strictly greater than 1 point, Action A0 is a dominant strategy for maximizing points.

First incorporate the contract into the payoffs.

Contract effects on **your** payoff:
- If **you** choose **A0**: you **receive +1** (from the other player).
- If **you** choose **A1**: you **pay -1** (to the other player).
- If the **other player** chooses **A0**: you **pay -1** (to them).
- If the **other player** chooses **A1**: you **receive +1** (from them).

So your **total payoff** = (base payoff) + (effect of your action) + (effect of their action).

Compute each outcome:

- (A0, A0): base 2 + (you A0: +1) + (they A0: -1) = **2**
- (A0, A1): base 0 + (you A0: +1) + (they A1: +1) = **2**
- (A1, A0): base 3 + (you A1: -1) + (they A0: -1) = **1**
- (A1, A1): base 1 + (you A1: -1) + (they A1: +1) = **1**

Thus:
- If you play **A0**, you always get **2**, no matter what they do.
- If you play **A1**, you always get **1**, no matter what they do.

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**. The best strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.

response:
First adjust payoffs to include the contract.

Contract effects on **your** payoff (Player 2):
- If **you choose A0**: you get **+1** from the other player.
- If **you choose A1**: you **pay 1** to the other player (so **-1** to you).
Also, the other player’s choice affects you:
- If **they choose A0**: they take **+1** from you (so **-1** to you).
- If **they choose A1**: they pay **1** to you (so **+1** to you).

Now compute your total payoff in each outcome:

1) (You A0, Other A0): base 2 + (you +1) + (other A0 → you -1) = 2  
2) (You A0, Other A1): base 0 + (you +1) + (other A1 → you +1) = 2  
3) (You A1, Other A0): base 3 + (you -1) + (other A0 → you -1) = 1  
4) (You A1, Other A1): base 1 + (you -1) + (other A1 → you +1) = 1  

So:
- If you play **A0**, you always get **2**.
- If you play **A1**, you always get **1**.

Therefore **A0 strictly dominates A1**, so the optimal strategy is to play A0 with probability 100%.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine the optimal strategy for the decision-making game, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and then assess how the payment contract transforms it.

### Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma where A1 is the dominant strategy and (A1, A1) is the Nash equilibrium.

### The Contract Adjustment:
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive **+2 points**, taken from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payment occurs.

Let's recalculate the final payoffs based on this contract:

1.  **(A0, A0):**
    - P1 receives $2$ (base) $+ 2$ (A0 bonus) $- 2$ (paid to P2 for their A0) $= 2$ points.
    - P2 receives $2$ (base) $+ 2$ (A0 bonus) $- 2$ (paid to P1 for their A0) $= 2$ points.
2.  **(A0, A1):**
    - P1 receives $0$ (base) $+ 2$ (A0 bonus) $- 0$ (no payment to P2) $= 2$ points.
    - P2 receives $3$ (base) $+ 0$ (no A0 bonus) $- 2$ (paid to P1 for their A0) $= 1$ point.
3.  **(A1, A0):**
    - P1 receives $3$ (base) $+ 0$ (no A0 bonus) $- 2$ (paid to P2 for their A0) $= 1$ point.
    - P2 receives $0$ (base) $+ 2$ (A0 bonus) $- 0$ (no payment to P1) $= 2$ points.
4.  **(A1, A1):**
    - P1 receives $1$ (base) $+ 0$ (no adjustments) $= 1$ point.
    - P2 receives $1$ (base) $+ 0$ (no adjustments) $= 1$ point.

### Transformed Payoff Matrix:
| | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2) | (2, 1) |
| **Player 1: A1** | (1, 2) | (1, 1) |

### Strategic Analysis:
In the transformed game:
- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 earns **2** points with A0 and **1** point with A1.
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 earns **2** points with A0 and **1** point with A1.

In both scenarios, A0 results in a higher payoff for Player 1 than A1 (2 > 1). Thus, **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy**. The contract has successfully reversed the original incentives, effectively automating cooperation (A0) by making it the most profitable individual choice.

To maximize total points received, the optimal move is to play A0 with 100% probability.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without contract)**

This is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with the following payoffs (Player 1 vs. Player 2):

|         | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (2,2) | (0,3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3,0) | (1,1) |

This is a classic game resembling a **"Battle of the Sexes"** or **asymmetric coordination game with incentives to miscoordinate**, but with some differences.

But now, there's a **contract**: 

> - If a player chooses **A0**, they receive an **additional 2 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses **A1**, there is **no additional payment**.

This **contract is binding and must be factored into the payoffs**.

---

### **Step 2: Adjust payoffs to include contract effects**

Let’s compute **Player 2's (yours) total payoff** in each outcome, including the contract.

Important: The **"additional 2 points"** from choosing A0 are **taken from the other player**. So:

- If **you (Player 2)** choose A0 → you gain +2, and **Player 1 loses 2**
- If **Player 1** chooses A0 → they gain +2, and **you lose 2**
- If both choose A0 → you gain +2 (from contract), Player 1 gains +2 (from contract)
- If someone chooses A1 → no contract payment

So we need to adjust the original payoffs **by adding the contract effect**.

Let’s build a new payoff matrix for **Player 2**, considering contract:

---

#### Case 1: You choose A0, Other (P1) chooses A0  
- Base payoff (from original game): **2**
- You chose A0 → +2 from contract
- P1 chose A0 → they get +2 → this **costs you 2** (since it's taken from you)
→ Total: 2 + 2 - 2 = **2**

#### Case 2: You choose A0, Other (P1) chooses A1  
- Base payoff: 0
- You chose A0 → +2
- P1 chose A1 → no contract cost to you
→ Total: 0 + 2 = **2**

#### Case 3: You choose A1, Other (P1) chooses A0  
- Base payoff: 3
- You chose A1 → no contract benefit
- P1 chose A0 → they get +2 → this **costs you 2**
→ Total: 3 - 2 = **1**

#### Case 4: You choose A1, Other (P1) chooses A1  
- Base payoff: 1
- You chose A1 → no contract benefit
- P1 chose A1 → no contract effect
→ Total: 1

So, **your adjusted payoff matrix (Player 2)** is:

|         | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0** | 2      | 2      |
| **You: A1** | 1      | 1      |

Wait — this is interesting! Your payoff for choosing A0 is **2 in both cases**, and choosing A1 gives you **1 in both cases**.

This means: **Regardless of what Player 1 does, choosing A0 gives you 2 points, and choosing A1 gives you 1 point.**

So A0 strictly dominates A1 for you!

---

### **Step 3: Does this mean you should always play A0?**

Yes — according to **your expected payoff**, no matter what Player 1 does, A0 gives you 2 points, A1 gives you 1 point.

So even if Player 1 plays mixed strategies, your expected payoff is:

- If you play A0 with probability 1 → you get 2
- If you play A1 with any positive probability → you get less than 2

So **your best response is to play A0 with probability 100%**.

But wait — we must also consider: **does Player 1 rationalize this?**

Let’s double-check: is there any incentive for Player 1 to deviate?

Even if we consider Player 1's perspective, the key is: **we are maximizing our own payoff**, not necessarily coordinating.

But since this is a simultaneous game, we must **find a Nash equilibrium** under the new contract, or at least choose a best response.

But here's the key insight: **For you (Player 2), A0 strictly dominates A1 in terms of expected payoff**.

So regardless of what Player 1 does, **your optimal action is to choose A0 with probability 100%**.

Even if the other player changes their strategy, your payoff from A0 is always higher than from A1.

Therefore, **your optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% chance**.

---

### **Step 4: Check contract impact on Player 1**

Let’s verify this result is consistent.

Suppose you play A0 100%.

Then:

- If Player 1 plays A0: they get 2 (base) + 2 (contract) = 4, you get 2 (base) + 2 (your contract) - 2 (their contract cost) = 2
- If Player 1 plays A1: they get 3 (base) + 0 = 3, you get 0 (base) + 2 = 2

So Player 1 prefers A0 (4 > 3). So Player 1 will play A0.

Then both play A0 → you get 2, they get 4.

But if you play A0 always, and they play A0 always, that’s a stable outcome.

Alternatively, suppose you play A0 always → they are better off playing A0 → so yes, equilibrium.

Could Player 1 play A1? Only if they think you’re playing A1 — but you have no incentive to do that.

But again: **We are only choosing our strategy — we don’t need to simulate Player 1’s full strategy space**, just choose **our best response**.

Our best response is clearly to play **A0 100%**, since it guarantees us 2 points vs. only 1 for A1.

---

### **Conclusion**

- Your payoff for A0 is 2 in all cases.
- Your payoff for A1 is 1 in all cases.
- A0 strictly dominates A1.
- Therefore, the optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

This is a **simultaneous move game** with two players (Player 1 and Player 2), each choosing between A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 2's payoff in parentheses, since you are Player 2):

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | 2 (2)        | 0 (3)        |
| **Player 2: A1** | 3 (0)        | 1 (1)        |

So the actual payoffs are:

- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

This is a variant of the **coordination game with a temptation to defect**, but importantly, **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)** are both Nash equilibria, but **(A0, A0)** gives higher payoffs for both.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria.

- **(A0, A0)**: If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2’s best response is A0 (2 > 1). If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1’s best response is A0 (2 > 0). So it is a NE.
- **(A1, A1)**: If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2’s BR is A1 (1 > 0). If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1’s BR is A1 (1 > 0). So it is also a NE.
- **(A0, A1)**: Player 2 gets 0, but would prefer A1 (1 > 0), so not BR.
- **(A1, A0)**: Player 2 gets 3, which is best, but Player 1 only gets 0, while playing A1 gives 1, so Player 1 would deviate. Not equilibrium.

So there are **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). (A0, A0) is **Pareto efficient** (total 4), while (A1, A1) gives only 2 total. So (A0, A0) is better for both.

But there’s a problem: **(A0, A0)** is not risk-dominant? Let’s check.

In coordination games, risk dominance considers which equilibrium is more stable under uncertainty. But for now, the key is: **we want to coordinate on (A0, A0)** to maximize mutual payoff.

However, **(A1, A0)** gives Player 2 3, but Player 1 only 0 — so Player 1 would never accept A1 while Player 2 plays A0. So coordination on A0-A0 is better if both commit.

Now: **You are Player 2**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract System**

There is a **contract** that can be voted on via **approval voting**.

- Contracts specify **additional payments** based on actions.
- The contract is applied **on top** of the base payoffs.
- Payments are **from one player to another**, split equally if multiple players.
- The contract is selected **uniformly at random from those with the most approvals**.
- So: your goal is to **maximize your expected points**, considering that:
  - You choose which contracts to **approve** (vote for),
  - And the **winning contract** is chosen from those with **max approvals** (so you want to help your favorite contracts survive to the final selection).

You cannot impose a contract — only **approve or reject**.

If a contract gets **more approvals than others**, it is selected, potentially.

But since the winning contract is **uniformly random among those with maximum approvals**, you must **strategically approve contracts** that you want to win, or that maximize your expected payoff under that contract, assuming it wins.

But **you cannot control whether your preferred contract wins** — only **which ones you approve**.

So the best strategy: **Approve only the contracts that are good for you, assuming they win**.

But since **multiple contracts can win** (if they tie for most approvals), you want to **approve only contracts that benefit you** and **avoid approving contracts that could hurt you or benefit the other player disproportionately**.

So key goal: **Maximize your expected points** *assuming the winning contract is one that is approved by you and possibly others*, and it's uniformly random among the most-approved contracts.

Since **you are indifferent between contracts** that are equally approved, and only the winning one matters, **you want to support contracts that are best for you**, and **not support contracts that are worse for you**.

So we must **evaluate each contract from your perspective as Player 2**.

Let’s analyze each contract.

---

### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Let’s unpack.

This is **symmetric** — applies to all players equally.

- If you choose **A0**: you get +1 (from the other player).
- If you choose **A1**: you pay -1 (goes to the other player).
- The cost/benefit is **independent of the opponent’s choice**, but depends only on **your own action**.

So the **additional payment** is a **transfer based on your own action**, with the other player paying you or you paying them.

Now, since the contract is symmetric and applies to both players, let's compute **your total payoff under C1**, which is base payoff + contract payment.

Let’s tabulate your total payoff under C1:

| Your Action | Opponent’s Action | Base Payoff | Contract Payment (you) | Total Payoff |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------------|--------------|
| A0          | A0                | 2           | +1                     | **3**        |
| A0          | A1                | 0           | +1                     | **1**        |
| A1          | A0                | 3           | -1                     | **2**        |
| A1          | A1                | 1           | -1                     | **0**        |

So the **new payoff matrix** for Player 2 (you):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | 3      | 1      |
| **P2: A1**    | 2      | 0      |

Now, let’s analyze best responses for you (Player 2):

- If P1 plays A0:
  - You: A0 → 3, A1 → 2 → **Best response: A0**
- If P1 plays A1:
  - You: A0 → 1, A1 → 0 → **Best response: A0**

So **no matter what P1 does, your best response is A0**.

That means **A0 is dominant strategy for you** under C1.

Now, what about P1’s incentives?

P1’s total payoff under C1:

| P1 A0 | P2 A0 | P1: 2 + 1 = 3 (P2 pays 1) |
|-------|-------|--------------------------|
| P1 A0 | P2 A1 | P1: 2 + 1 = 3 (P2 pays 1) → but wait, when P2 chooses A1, P2 pays 1 → so P1 gets +1 |
| P1 A1 | P2 A0 | P1: 0 + (-1) = -1 |
| P1 A1 | P2 A1 | P1: 1 + (-1) = 0 |

So P1’s payoff (you are P2):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 3      | 3      |
| **P1: A1**    | -1     | 0      |

So P1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → A0

So **A0 is dominant for P1 too**.

Therefore, **under C1, (A0, A0) is the unique dominant-strategy equilibrium**.

In this equilibrium, both play A0, and your total payoff is **3**.

In any other case, your payoff is 1 or 2 or 0, so only (A0, A0) gives you the full benefit.

So **if C1 passes**, you are guaranteed to get **3** (assuming rational play), since both players will play A0.

Thus, **C1 is very good for you**.

Therefore, **you should approve C1**.

---

### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

This is **not symmetric**.

Note: The contract says **"a player chooses A1, they pay 1"**, so **every player** who chooses A1 pays 1, and the money goes to the **other player**, distributed equally among them.

But since there are only two players, **"distributed equally among other players"** means the **entire 1 point goes to the other player**.

So:

- If you choose A1 → you pay 1 → opponent gets +1
- If you choose A0 → no change

So this applies to **both players** symmetrically.

Now, let's compute your adjusted payoff under C2.

| Your A | Opp A | Base Pay | Contract Pay | Total Pay |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| A0     | A0    | 2        | 0            | 2         |
| A0     | A1    | 0        | 0            | 0         |
| A1     | A0    | 3        | -1           | 2         |
| A1     | A1    | 1        | -1           | 0         |

So payoff matrix for you (Player 2):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | 2      | 0      |
| **P2: A1**    | 2      | 0      |

Interesting! **You get the same payoff regardless of your action**.

- If you play A0: you get 2 (if P1 plays A0) or 0 (if P1 plays A1)
- If you play A1: you get 2 (if P1 plays A0) or 0 (if P1 plays A1)

So **your action has no effect on your payoff**.

But your action does affect **P1’s** payoffs.

Let’s compute P1’s total payoff under C2:

| P1 A | P2 A | Base | Contract | Total |
|------|------|------|----------|-------|
| A0   | A0   | 2    | 0        | 2     |
| A0   | A1   | 3    | -1       | 2     |
| A1   | A0   | 0    | 0        | 0     |
| A1   | A1   | 1    | -1       | 0     |

So P1’s payoffs:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 2      | 2      |
| **P1: A1**    | 0      | 0      |

So P1 **must play A0** (gets 2 vs 0) — regardless of your action.

So P1 will always play A0 under C2 (if rational).

Then, knowing P1 plays A0, your payoff:

- If you play A0: 2
- If you play A1: 2

So you are indifferent.

So **you get 2 regardless**.

But the **equilibrium is**: P1 plays A0, you play either A0 or A1 (since payoff is same).

So you **can get 2** with certainty if P1 plays A0.

But **could you do better?** No — maximum possible is 3.

In this contract, **you are guaranteed 2**, whether you play A0 or A1.

But in **C1**, you were guaranteed **3** in equilibrium.

So **C2 is worse for you than C1**.

But is it better than the base game?

In base game, without contracts, we had two equilibria.

But **in the base game**, players might play (A1, A1) and get only 1 each.

Or (A0, A0) and get 2 each.

So without contract, you could get **2 or 3**, depending on coordination.

But **C2 guarantees you 2**, assuming rational P1.

C1 guarantees you **3**, assuming rational P1.

So **C1 is strictly better**.

Now, **C2: you are indifferent between A0 and A1**, but must choose one.

But P1 will always play A0.

So your payoff is **2**.

But in C1, it was **3**.

So **C2 gives you less**.

Now, should you **approve C2**?

You are **Player 2**, and C2 is **your own proposal**.

But **approving it means you vote for it**.

But if **C1 is also proposed**, and both are approved, and both get same number of approvals, then **the winner is random between C1 and C2**.

So let’s suppose both you and P1 vote on both contracts.

But we don’t know what P1 will do.

But we do know that **P1 proposed C1** and **P2 (you)** proposed C2.

So likely, **P1 will approve C1**, and might or might not approve C2.

But **you don't know**. You must analyze based on **your own preferences**.

But your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Now, suppose **you approve both C1 and C2**.

Then:

- C1 gets at least 1 approval (you)
- C1 also gets approval from P1 (likely)

So C1 has at least 2 approvals.

C2 gets 1 (you), possibly 0 from P1 (who may reject it, since it's not in their interest?).

Let’s see: Does P1 want C2?

From above: under C2, P1 gets:

- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 2 (from A0) or 0 (from A1)
- If P2 plays A1: same

So P1’s best response is A0, and gets 2.

Previously, P1 could get 3 in base game (if you play A0), but under C2, P1 gets only 2.

But in base game, if P1 plays A0 and you play A1, P1 gets 3 — so potentially higher.

But **under the contract**, P1 gets **2** in equilibrium.

So P1 gets **2** under C2.

But in base game, **P1 could get 3** (if you play A1).

But is that likely? Only if you choose A1.

But in base game, (A0, A0) is stable.

But anyway, **under C2**, P1 gets **2**, which is **less than maximum possible 3**, but more than 0.

But **P1 proposed C1**, which gives them **3** (if you play A0), so they definitely prefer C1.

So **P1 will probably reject C2** (since C1 is better for them).

So if **you approve C1 and C2**, then:

- C1: approvals = 2 (you + P1)
- C2: approvals = 1 (only you)

Then **C1 wins** (more approvals), so **you get 3**.

So **you benefit**.

But suppose you **only approve C1**, and reject C2.

Then C1 gets 2 approvals (if P1 approves), C2 gets 1 (you), so C1 wins → you get 3.

Same outcome.

But suppose you only approve C2.

Then C1 gets 1 approval (P1), C2 gets 1 approval (you).

Then **both have 1 approval**, so winner is **random between C1 and C2**.

Then your **expected payoff** = 0.5 × (payoff under C1) + 0.5 × (payoff under C2)

- Under C1: 3
- Under C2: 2

So expected payoff = 0.5×3 + 0.5×2 = 1.5 + 1 = **2.5**

But if you **approve both**, and C1 gets 2 approvals (from you and P1), C2 gets 1, then C1 wins surely → you get **3**

So 3 > 2.5 → better to approve both.

But is it necessary?

Wait — **you can always approve both** and **still get 3**, since C1 will definitely win.

So approving C2 doesn’t hurt you — but it might cause a tie if C1 gets fewer approvals.

But **P1 proposed C1**, so they will almost certainly approve it.

So C1 will have at least 1 approval (P1), and possibly 2.

C2 has you as a voter.

So if **you approve C1**, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 → C1 wins → you get 3.

If **you approve only C2**, then:
- C1: 1 (P1 only)
- C2: 1 (you)
→ tie → random winner → expected payoff 2.5
→ worse than 3

Therefore, **you should approve both C1 and C2**.

But wait — is there any reason **not** to approve C2?

C2 gives you **only 2**, while C1 gives **3**.

But **you are allowed to approve multiple**.

And since C1 will almost surely win if you approve it (and P1 does), then approving C2 doesn’t hurt you — it only *might* help C2 if C1 is weak.

But if P1 approves C1, C1 will have **at least 1**, and if you approve C1, it has **2**.

Unless P1 doesn’t approve C1 — but they proposed it, so they likely will.

So unless P1 is irrational, they’ll approve C1.

So **C1 will have at least 2 approvals**, C2 at most 1.

So C1 wins.

Hence, **approving C2 doesn't change outcome** — you still get 3.

But **approving C2 only hurts you if it causes a tie and C2 wins** — but it can't, because C2 has at most 1 approval, C1 has at least 2 → C1 always wins.

So **you can safely approve C2** without risk.

Moreover, if for some reason P1 *doesn’t* approve C1 (unlikely), but approves C2, then C1: 1, C2: 2 → C2 wins → you get 2.

But that’s worse than if you had approved C1 and it won.

But you can **avoid that** by **only approving C1**.

So if you **approve both**, you risk C2 winning if C1 gets only 1 (P1 not voting), but C1 has only 1 — so tie — then 50% chance you get 2, 50% get 3 → **expected 2.5**

But if you **approve only C1**, and P1 approves C1, you get 3.

So **better to approve only C1**, and **not approve C2**, to avoid diluting the chance.

But what if P1 **doesn’t approve C1**?

Why would they not? They proposed it. Probably they approve it.

But to be safe, you should assume they **will**.

But in **game theory**, we assume rational players.

So:

- P1 proposed C1 → they believe it’s good for them → they will approve it → 1 approval for C1.
- You are considering whether to approve C1.

If you **approve C1**, C1 has 2 approvals → wins.
If you **don’t**, C1 has 1 → C2 has 1 → tie → random → expected payoff for you: (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5

So **if you approve C1 → you get 3**
If you **don’t approve C1 → you get 2.5** on average

Therefore, **you should approve C1**.

Now, should you approve C2?

C2 is **only beneficial if it wins**.

But C2 gives you only 2, and it only wins if it has **as many approvals as C1**, and wins randomly.

But if you **approve C1**, C1 gets 2 approvals.

C2 will only get 1 (from you) → so C2 loses.

So **approving C2 doesn’t help C2 win** — it only adds a vote to a losing contract.

So it has **no effect** on outcome.

But it costs you **nothing** — you can approve it.

But does it **benefit** you?

No — it doesn’t increase your payoff.

But is it **harmful**?

Only if it **causes C2 to win**.

But it can’t, because C1 will have 2 approvals if you approve it.

So **C2 wins only if C1 has ≤1 approval**, but if you approve C1, it has 2.

So **only if you don’t approve C1** can C2 win.

But in that case, **you are better off not approving C2** — because if you don’t approve C1 and don’t approve C2, then:
- C1: 1 (P1)
- C2: 0
→ C1 wins → you get 3

So better than 2.5.

But if you approve C1, you get 3.

Best is: **approve only C1**, reject C2.

Then:
- C1: 2 (you and P1)
- C2: 0
→ C1 wins → you get 3

If you approve both:
- C1: 2
- C2: 1
→ C1 wins → you still get 3

So **same outcome**.

But approving C2 is **harmless**.

But you are trying to **maximize your expected points**, so you don’t care about the number of approvals — only the **winning contract**.

So approving C2 **doesn’t hurt**, but **doesn’t help**.

But in **approval voting**, you can approve multiple.

So technically, you can approve both.

But suppose you **approve C1 and not C2**, you still get 3.

If you approve C2 too, still get 3.

So **no penalty**.

But is there any reason not to?

The only risk is **if C2 becomes a contender**, but it can’t if you approve C1.

But if by approving C2, you **lower the chance that C1 wins**, but no — it only helps.

Wait: **approval voting** doesn’t care about the number of approvals **unless** it creates a tie.

But with C1 getting 2, C2 getting 1, no tie.

So **C1 wins** regardless.

So **you can approve both** without harm.

But **do you want to approve C2?**

Well, **C2 is your own proposal**, and you are Player 2.

But you are not required to approve it — but you can.

But **since it gives you only 2**, and you can get 3 from C1, **you should not voluntarily hurt your own prospects**.

But approving C2 doesn't hurt — as shown.

But suppose **P1 also approves C2**.

Then C2 has 2 approvals (you and P1), C1 has 2 (you and P1) → tie → random — expected payoff 2.5

Which is **worse** than 3.

So you **don’t want that**.

But if you **approve C2**, and P1 approves both, then C1 and C2 both have 2 approvals → tie → you get 2.5

But if you **don’t approve C2**, then C1 has 2, C2 has 1 → C1 wins → 3

So **better to not approve C2**.

Therefore, **you should NOT approve C2**.

Because if you do, and P1 approves both, then **C1 and C2 tie** → you get **2.5** instead of **3**

So by approving C2, you risk **reducing your expected payoff**.

Hence, **you should not approve C2**.

---

### **Final Evaluation:**

- **C1 (proposed by P1)**: Gives you **3** in equilibrium. You should **approve it**.
- **C2 (proposed by you)**: Gives you **2** at best. But **can lead to risk of tie** and **lower expected payoff** (2.5) if P1 also approves it. So **you should NOT approve it**.

Therefore, you should **approve C1 only**.

response:
Step 1: Understand how contracts change payoffs  
Transfers are between the two players (so “distributed equally among other players” just means “to the other player”).

### Contract C1 (Player 1’s proposal)
- If you play **A0**: you **receive +1** from the other player.
- If you play **A1**: you **pay −1** to the other player.
And symmetrically, you also either pay/receive depending on what the other player chose.

So Player 1’s net payoff = base payoff + (effect of P1 action) + (effect of P2 action on transfers).

Compute outcomes:

- (A0, A0): base 2; P1 gets +1 (for A0) and pays −1 (because P2 played A0 and receives +1) ⇒ net 0 ⇒ **2**
- (A0, A1): base 0; P1 gets +1 (own A0) and gets +1 (because P2 played A1 and pays) ⇒ net +2 ⇒ **2**
- (A1, A0): base 3; P1 pays −1 (own A1) and pays −1 (because P2 played A0 and receives) ⇒ net −2 ⇒ **1**
- (A1, A1): base 1; P1 pays −1 (own A1) and receives +1 (because P2 played A1) ⇒ net 0 ⇒ **1**

So under C1, for Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 gives 2 vs A1 gives 1
- If P2 plays A1: A0 gives 2 vs A1 gives 1  
Therefore **A0 strictly dominates A1**, so the unique outcome is **(A0, A0)** with payoff **2** to each.

That’s strictly better than the original game where **A1 strictly dominates A0**, leading to (A1, A1) with payoff **1** each.

✅ C1 is very good for me.

---

### Contract C2 (Player 2’s proposal)
- If you play **A0**: no transfer.
- If you play **A1**: you **pay −1** to the other player.

Compute Player 1 outcomes:

- (A0, A0): base 2; no transfers ⇒ **2**
- (A0, A1): base 0; P2 pays +1 to P1 ⇒ **1**
- (A1, A0): base 3; P1 pays −1 ⇒ **2**
- (A1, A1): base 1; P1 pays −1 and receives +1 ⇒ **1**

Here Player 1 is **indifferent** between A0 and A1 regardless of what P2 does (always tied). Same for Player 2. So there are many possible equilibria / outcomes, ranging from **1** to **2**, and there’s no force pushing uniquely to (A0, A0).

So C2 is not as reliably good as C1.

❌ I should not approve C2, because approving it could create a tie among top-approved contracts and make the final selected contract random between C1 and C2, reducing my expected payoff compared to trying to make C1 the unique winner.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game
The base game payoff matrix (from my perspective as Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 2, P1 gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0, P1 gets 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, P1 gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 1, P1 gets 1

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma. Without contracts, A1 is a dominant strategy for both players, leading to the Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) with payoff (1, 1).

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1
Contract 1 transfers:
- Playing A0: receive +1 from other player
- Playing A1: pay -1 to other player

Net transfers for each outcome:
- (A0, A0): I get +1-1=0, P1 gets +1-1=0
- (A0, A1): I get +1+1=+2, P1 gets -1-1=-2
- (A1, A0): I get -1-1=-2, P1 gets +1+1=+2
- (A1, A1): I get -1+1=0, P1 gets -1+1=0

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 2+0=**2**
- (A0, A1): 0+2=**2**
- (A1, A0): 3-2=**1**
- (A1, A1): 1+0=**1**

Under Contract 1, A0 dominates A1 for me (2 > 1 regardless of P1's action).

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2
Contract 2 transfers:
- Playing A0: no payment
- Playing A1: pay -2 to other player

Net transfers:
- (A0, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): I get +2, P1 gets -2
- (A1, A0): I get -2, P1 gets +2  
- (A1, A1): I get -2+2=0, P1 gets -2+2=0

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 2+0=**2**
- (A0, A1): 0+2=**2**
- (A1, A0): 3-2=**1**
- (A1, A1): 1+0=**1**

Contract 2 yields the **exact same payoff structure** as Contract 1!

## Step 4: Compare outcomes
Both contracts transform the game so that:
- A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players
- Nash equilibrium becomes (A0, A0) with payoff (2, 2)

**Comparison:**
- Without contract: Expected payoff = 1 (playing A1, A1)
- With either contract: Expected payoff = 2 (playing A0, A0)

Both contracts improve my payoff from 1 to 2. Since they are functionally equivalent and both beneficial, I should approve both.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game without contract

The payoff matrix (my payoff, other's payoff):
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

This is a prisoner's dilemma. A1 is the dominant strategy:
- If other plays A0: I get 3 from A1 vs 2 from A0 → prefer A1
- If other plays A1: I get 1 from A1 vs 0 from A0 → prefer A1

**Nash equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → I get 1 point**

## Step 2: Analyze the game with contract

The contract adds: "If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points to the other player"

New payoff matrix:
- (A0, A0): I get 2, other gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 2 = 2, other gets 3 - 2 = 1
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 2 = 1, other gets 0 + 2 = 2
- (A1, A1): I get 1 - 2 + 2 = 1, other gets 1 - 2 + 2 = 1

Now A0 becomes dominant:
- If other plays A0: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → prefer A0

**Nash equilibrium with contract: (A0, A0) → I get 2 points**

## Step 3: Decision to sign

The contract activates only if both players sign. The meta-game outcomes:
- Both sign → contract active → we both play A0 → I get 2 points
- At least one doesn't sign → no contract → we both play A1 → I get 1 point

Signing weakly dominates not signing:
- If other signs: signing gives me 2 vs 1 if I don't sign
- If other doesn't sign: both choices give me 1

Since 2 > 1, and the contract transforms the prisoner's dilemma into a cooperation game, signing is rational.

**Additionally, I proposed this contract (as Player 2), which signals I found it beneficial.**

- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether Player 2 (you) should sign the contract.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without contract)**

This is a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (from Player 2's perspective, since you are Player 2):

|           | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 2: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

Note: The pair (x, y) means Player 2 gets x, Player 1 gets y.

This is a classic **coordination and conflict game**, similar to a **battle of the sexes** or a **prisoner's dilemma** variant.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria of the original game:

- Pure strategy Nash equilibria:
  - (A0, A0): both get 2 → if Player 2 deviates to A1, gets 3? No: if Player 1 plays A0, A1 gives 3 > 2 → so Player 2 wants to deviate → not NE.
    - Wait: (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 2. If Player 2 switches to A1 while Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 3 → better → so (A0, A0) is not a NE.
  - (A1, A1): both get 1. If Player 2 switches to A0 while Player 1 plays A1 → Player 2 gets 0 < 1 → bad. So Player 2 won’t switch.
    - Similarly, Player 1 won’t switch from A1 to A0 if Player 2 plays A1 → gets 0 < 1. So (A1, A1) **is a NE**.
  - (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 0. If Player 2 switches to A1 → gets 1 > 0 → so not NE.
  - (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 3. If Player 2 stays at A1, gets 3. If Player 2 switches to A0 → gets 2 < 3 → so Player 2 won’t switch.
    - But Player 1: currently gets 0. If Player 1 switches to A1 → gets 1 > 0 → so Player 1 wants to deviate. So not NE.

So only **(A1, A1)** is a pure Nash equilibrium.

Now check for mixed strategies.

Let:
- Player 1 play A0 with probability p
- Player 2 play A0 with probability q

Player 2’s expected payoff from A0:
- 2·p + 0·(1-p) = 2p

From A1:
- 3·(1-p) + 1·p = 3 - 3p + p = 3 - 2p

For Player 2 to be indifferent (mixed strategy equilibrium):
2p = 3 - 2p → 4p = 3 → p = 3/4

Similarly, for Player 1 to be indifferent:
Let q be Player 2’s probability of A0.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 2·q + 0·(1-q) = 2q
- A1: 3·(1-q) + 1·q = 3 - 2q

Set equal: 2q = 3 - 2q → 4q = 3 → q = 3/4

So mixed strategy Nash equilibrium: both play A0 with 3/4, A1 with 1/4.

In this case, Player 2’s expected payoff:
- From A0: 2·(3/4) = 1.5
- From A1: 3 - 2·(3/4) = 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 → so expected payoff = 1.5 (from indifference)

So in the mixed strategy NE, Player 2 gets 1.5.

In the pure strategy NE (A1, A1), Player 2 gets 1.

So the best equilibrium for Player 2 is the mixed strategy with 1.5.

But we don’t know what the other player will do — but in the absence of communication, rational players may converge to a NE.

But now comes the **contract**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

You are Player 2, and the contract is proposed by Player 1.

Key points:
- The contract is only active if **both players sign it**.
- You must decide whether to sign the contract.
- You are the one deciding whether to sign it — but if you don’t sign, the contract doesn't go into effect, regardless of the other player’s vote (since it requires consensus).
- The contract modifies the payoff **based on your action**.

Let’s analyze the **effect on payoffs** of the contract.

Let’s suppose **you sign the contract** and **Player 1 signs it**.

Then, for each action you take:
- If you play A0 → you get +1 (from the contract)
- If you play A1 → you get -1 (you pay 1, distributed to the other player)

But: “drawn equally from the other players” → meaning:
- If you play A0 → you gain 1 point, but it’s taken **from the other player** (in this case, Player 1).
- If you play A1 → you pay 1 point, and it’s distributed **to the other player** (Player 1).

So the contract is **one-directional**: the cost or benefit is taken from or given to the **other player**.

So in your payoff, if you sign the contract:
- Choosing A0: your payoff increases by **+1** (and Player 1 loses 1)
- Choosing A1: your payoff decreases by **-1** (and Player 1 gains 1)

But note: this happens **in addition to** the base game payoffs.

So the **new payoff matrix** (from Player 2's perspective, when contract is active) is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0           | A1           |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**               | (2+1, 2-1) = (3,1) | (0+1, 3-1) = (1,2) |
| **A1**               | (3-1, 0+1) = (2,1) | (1-1, 1+1) = (0,2) |

Note: Payoffs are (Player 2, Player 1)

So revised matrix:

- (A0, A0): (3, 1)
- (A0, A1): (1, 2)
- (A1, A0): (2, 1)
- (A1, A1): (0, 2)

Now, let’s analyze this new game.

We want to know: **if you sign the contract and the other player signs it**, what is your expected payoff?

But you must decide whether to sign **before** knowing what the other player will do — but if you sign, the contract only takes effect if **both** sign.

So your decision: **should you sign**?

You must consider: Will the other player sign? What if they don’t?

But the contract is only active if **both** sign. So if you sign but Player 1 doesn’t, then **contract does not apply** — and you get the original payoff.

Therefore, your **expected payoff depends on what you believe Player 1 will do**.

But we don’t have information on Player 1’s preferences — but we can assume that Player 1 is rational and will act to maximize their own payoff.

So to predict whether Player 1 will sign the contract, we must consider: **if you sign, will Player 1 want to sign?**

But you are making the choice now — so you must **anticipate** whether signing will lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.

We can model this as a **sequential decision** with rational players.

But since both players must sign, and the contract only applies if both do, you can only benefit from the contract **if both sign**.

So you must ask:
- If I sign, will Player 1 sign?
- If Player 1 signs, will it be better for me?
- And is it in Player 1’s interest to sign if I sign?

So let’s analyze the **incentive** of Player 1 to sign the contract, **given that you will sign**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Player 1’s perspective if you sign**

If you sign the contract, then the **new payoff matrix** is as above (from Player 1’s perspective, the payoffs are flipped):

From Player 1’s view:
- (A0, A0): 1
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A0): 1
- (A1, A1): 2

So Player 1’s payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------|----|----|
| **A0**  | 1  | 2  |
| **A1**  | 1  | 2  |

Wait — this is interesting.

No matter what Player 2 does, Player 1 gets **2** if they play A1, and **1** if they play A0.

So **A1 is strictly dominant** for Player 1.

So if the contract is in effect, Player 1 will always choose A1.

Now, what about you (Player 2)? You are trying to maximize your payoff **in the contract game**.

With the contract in effect, and Player 1 playing A1 (since it's dominant), your best choice:

- If you play A0 → you get 1 (from the matrix: (A0, A1) → (1,2))
- If you play A1 → you get 0

So you would choose A0 → get 1.

So in equilibrium: you play A0, Player 1 plays A1 → payoff: (1, 2)

Your expected payoff in contract game: **1**

But wait — is this the only equilibrium? Yes, because Player 1 has a dominant strategy (A1), so they will always play A1. Then you play A0 (since 1 > 0). So unique equilibrium: (A0, A1) → you get 1.

But **without** the contract, what happens?

Recall: original game.

The **only pure strategy NE** is (A1, A1), where you get 1.

There is a mixed strategy NE where both play A0 with 3/4, and your expected payoff is 1.5.

But if you don’t sign the contract, **and you don’t know what the other player will do**, your payoff depends on their strategy.

But in the absence of communication, and rational players, they might play the mixed strategy NE — giving you 1.5.

Or they might play A1.

But what is the **safe** assumption?

Let’s suppose that the other player is rational and will play optimally.

In the original game, the **best guarantee** for you is to play A1 — if Player 1 plays A1, you get 1. If Player 1 plays A0, you get 3. But there’s no way to guarantee more than 1 unless you coordinate.

But in the **mixed strategy NE**, you get 1.5.

But if Player 1 plays A1 (which is a NE), you get 1.

But in the mixed strategy equilibrium, you get 1.5.

So **in the original game**, your **expected payoff** in the mixed strategy NE is **1.5**.

Is there a way to ensure better than 1.5?

No — 1.5 is actually the **value** of the game from your perspective in the mixed strategy.

But let’s be precise: the **maxmin** value (your guaranteed payoff) is 1.

But **1.5 is higher**.

So if no contract, and both play rational strategies (mixed), your expected payoff is 1.5.

Now, if you sign the contract, and Player 1 signs, then **you must get 1**, because:
- Player 1 must play A1 (dominant)
- You play A0 → get 1

So your payoff is **1**

But **without** the contract, you could get **1.5** in the equilibrium.

So **1 < 1.5**, so signing the contract leads to a lower payoff.

But wait — is that correct?

Wait a second: **if we sign the contract, and the other player signs, we get 1**.

But if we do **not sign**, and the game proceeds uncontracted, then **we could get 1.5**.

Therefore, **signing the contract leads to lower payoff**.

But is it possible that Player 1 will **not** sign the contract?

Well, let’s see: if you sign, will Player 1 want to sign?

We already analyzed: if you sign the contract, **then the contract is in effect only if Player 1 also signs**.

Now: if you sign, and Player 1 **does not** sign, then contract is not active → game is original.

In that case, Player 1 can play optimally.

Player 1’s best response?

In the original game, if you play a pure strategy:
- If you play A0: Player 1's best response is A1 → gets 3 > 2
- If you play A1: Player 1's best response is A0 → gets 3 > 1? Wait — (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 0?

No: original matrix:

|       | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| P2 A0 | (2,2) | (0,3) |
| P2 A1 | (3,0) | (1,1) |

If you play A0, Player 1 gets 2 (if A0) or 3 (if A1) → so A1 is better.

If you play A1, Player 1 gets 0 (if A0) or 1 (if A1) → so A1 is better.

So **A1 is dominant for Player 1 in original game**.

Therefore, **if the contract is not active**, Player 1 will play A1 regardless of what you do.

Then, if you play A0 → you get 0
If you play A1 → you get 1

So your best response is A1 → you get 1.

So if you sign the contract but **Player 1 does not**, then:
- No contract → Player 1 plays A1 (dominant)
- You play A1 (best response)
- You get 1

Alternatively, if you **don’t sign**, and Player 1 doesn’t sign → same thing — you get 1.

But in the **mixed strategy equilibrium**, you could get 1.5.

So again, **if contract is not active**, you can get 1.5 (if both play mixed).

But if you **sign**, and Player 1 **does not sign**, you still get 1 (because you play A1, Player 1 plays A1).

So in both cases (you sign but P1 doesn’t, or you don’t sign), you get 1.

But in the **mixed NE**, you get 1.5.

So to get 1.5, you must both play mixed — but only if no contract.

Now, if you **do** sign the contract, and **Player 1 also signs**, then as we saw, you get 1.

But if **Player 1 does not sign**, the contract is off → you’re back to original game → you might get 1.5 (if they play mixed), or 1 (if they play A1).

But **Player 1 has no incentive to sign the contract**, because:

Let’s check: if you **sign**, and Player 1 considers signing:

- If Player 1 signs: contract is active.
  - Their payoff in the new game: from above, if you play A0 → they get 2; if you play A1 → they get 2
  - But they have a dominant strategy: A1 → they always play A1
  - Then whatever you do, they get 2.
- If Player 1 does **not** sign: contract is not active → you are playing the original game.
  - If Player 1 plays A1 (dominant), then your action matters:
    - If you play A0 → you get 0
    - If you play A1 → you get 1
  - But Player 1 doesn’t care what you do as long as they get their payoff.

But if you are rational, and contract is not active, you would play A1 → so Player 1 gets 1.

Wait, no: Player 1’s payoff depends on what you do.

If contract is **not** active:
- Player 1 plays A1 (dominant)
- You play A1 (best response to A1) → you get 1, Player 1 gets 1.

So if Player 1 does **not sign**, and you play optimal actions, they get 1.

But if Player 1 **does sign**, then contract is active, and:
- Player 1 plays A1 (dominant), you play A0 (best response) → Player 1 gets 2 (from the matrix: (A0, A1) → Player 1 gets 2)
- So Player 1 gets 2 > 1.

So **Player 1 benefits from signing the contract** — their payoff goes from 1 to 2 (if you play optimally).

So if **you sign**, **Player 1 has incentive to sign**, because they get more (2 vs 1).

So if you sign, Player 1 will sign — because it’s in their interest.

Then, with both signing, we are in the contract game.

And in that game:
- Player 1 plays A1 (dominant)
- You play A0 (best response: 1 > 0)
- Your payoff: **1**

But now consider: if you **do not sign**, what happens?

Then contract is not active.

Player 1 could play A1 (dominant), you play A1 → you get 1.

Or, if both play mixed, you get 1.5.

But if you do not sign, will Player 1 play mixed?

Player 1 has **no incentive** to cooperate — they have a dominant strategy A1, so even in the original game, they will play A1.

So if you **do not sign**, Player 1 plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 1.

Similarly, if you sign, **and Player 1 signs**, you get 1.

So in **both cases**, you get 1?

Wait — no, in the case where you **sign** and Player 1 **signs**, you get 1.

If you **don’t sign**, and Player 1 plays A1 (which they will), you get 1.

So same outcome?

But earlier I thought there was a mixed NE with 1.5 — but **only if both players behave non-dominantly**.

But **A1 is dominant for Player 1**, so they will always play A1.

Therefore, **in the original game**, Player 1 will play A1 regardless.

Then you, as Player 2, will play A1 (since 1 > 0) → payoff: 1.

So **in the original game**, your expected payoff is **1** — not 1.5.

The mixed strategy NE is unstable because Player 1 has a dominant strategy.

Let me verify: Is A1 dominant for Player 1?

In original game:

- If you play A0:
  - P1 A0 → gets 2
  - P1 A1 → gets 3 → better → so A1 better
- If you play A1:
  - P1 A0 → gets 0
  - P1 A1 → gets 1 → better → so A1 better

Yes — **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1**.

Therefore, **Player 1 will play A1**.

Then you play A1 → get 1.

So the only equilibrium outcome is (A1, A1) → you get 1.

The mixed strategy NE is **not credible** because Player 1 will never play A0 — it’s strictly dominated.

Therefore, in the original game, your **expected payoff is 1**.

Now, back to the contract.

If you sign the contract, and Player 1 signs → you get 1.

But if you don’t sign → contract not active → Player 1 plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 1.

So same outcome?

But wait — when contract is active, you get 1 in (A0,A1), but in the original game, you get 1 in (A1,A1).

Same payoff.

But let’s look deeper.

When contract is active, and you sign, and Player 1 signs:

- Player 1 plays A1 (dominant)
- You play A0 → because you get 1 (from A0) vs 0 (from A1) → so you prefer to play A0
- So you get 1

In original game:
- Player 1 plays A1
- You play A1 → because 1 > 0
- You get 1

So **same payoff**.

But is there a difference?

Wait — in the contract case, you get 1, but you are forced to play A0, which is your best response.

In original case, you play A1.

But payoff is same.

So no difference?

But let’s double-check the contract payoffs.

Contract active: you play A0 → you get +1 → base payoff is 0 (since opponent plays A1, you play A0) → so total: 0 + 1 = 1

Yes.

Original: you play A1, get 1

So same.

But is there a case where contract gives **more**?

No — in both cases, you get 1.

But what if Player 1 **doesn't** sign?

Then no contract → you play A1 → get 1.

Same.

So in **all cases**, you get **1**.

But wait — is there a way to get more than 1?

Only if you could coordinate on (A0,A0), but that’s not rational because Player 1 will not play A0.

So no.

Therefore, signing the contract **does not improve your payoff**.

But wait — there’s a **risk**.

If you sign, and Player 1 **does not** sign, the contract is off, and you still get 1.

But if you don’t sign, same.

So no disadvantage.

But is there a **benefit**?

No — payoff is the same.

But let’s think about **what Player 1 does if you sign**.

As we saw: if you sign, Player 1 will want to sign — because if they don’t, they get 1; if they do, they get 2.

So they will sign.

Then both sign, game proceeds.

But **your payoff is still 1**.

So no gain.

But is there a **loss**?

No.

But the question is: should you sign?

In this case, **you are indifferent** — payoff is 1 in all scenarios.

But wait — what if the other player **does not** sign?

Then contract is not active.

But if you sign, and they don’t, the contract doesn’t activate.

But you are not penalized — just no benefit.

But in that case, you still get 1.

So no harm.

But since you are **indifferent**, and signing doesn’t hurt, maybe it’s fine.

But let’s see: is there **any scenario** where signing gives you **less** than 1?

No.

But is there any scenario where it gives you **more**?

Only if you could get A0 with base payoff 2 — but Player 1 won’t play A0.

So no.

Wait — in the contract game, can you get more than 1?

No.

But let’s recheck the contract matrix:

If contract is active:

|        | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| P2 A0 | (3,1) | (1,2) |
| P2 A1 | (2,1) | (0,2) |

Now, if P1 plays A1 (dominant), then:

- P2 A0 → gets 1
- P2 A1 → gets 0
So P2 plays A0 → gets 1.

But if P1 played A0, P2 would get 3 — but P1 won’t.

So P2 gets 1.

So no way to get more than 1.

Therefore, signing the contract gives you **no improvement**.

But now, consider: **what if Player 1 is not rational**?

But we assume rational players.

So in all rational equilibria, you get 1.

But is there a **gain** for you?

No.

But the contract costs you **nothing** — you only get benefits if you are forced to play better actions.

But in this case, the contract **doesn't force you to play better** — it just makes A0 more attractive.

But Player 1 is still going to play A1, so you still get 1.

So final verdict: **signing the contract gives you no benefit**, and no cost.

But since it doesn't hurt, and might help if something changes, is it worth it?

But you're asked to **maximize your points**.

If signing doesn't change your expected payoff, and you are indifferent, you **should sign only if it's at least as good**.

But is it **strictly better**? No.

So it's **not beneficial**.

But there might be a **mistake**.

Wait — in the original game, Player 1 plays A1, you play A1 → you get 1.

In contract game, Player 1 plays A1, you play A0 → you get 1.

Same.

But notice: you **avoid playing A1**, which might be a psychological preference — but the problem is to **maximize points**, not utility.

So no.

Therefore, **signing the contract gives you the same expected points**.

So you are indifferent.

But the contract might **induce cooperation**, but in this game, there is no incentive for Player 1 to deviate from A1.

Player 1 benefits from signing the contract — they get 2 vs 1.

But for you, it's same.

So you should **sign** if it doesn’t hurt and there’s no downside.

But is there a downside?

Only if you sign and Player 1 doesn’t sign, then *you* are not penalized — the contract is inactive.

So no downside.

Therefore, you **should sign**, because it might lead to a better outcome — but in this case, it doesn’t.

Even better: if you sign, and Player 1 signs, you still get 1.

But if you sign, and Player 1 doesn't, you still get 1.

If you don't sign, you get 1.

So always 1.

So no change.

But let’s consider: what if in the original game, you could get 1.5, but only in mixed strategy, but we ruled that out because A1 is dominant.

Yes — because Player 1 will never play A0, because it's strictly dominated.

Therefore, the only equilibrium is (A1, A1) → you get 1.

So yes, you get 1 unless you coordinate on something else.

But you can't.

Therefore, **signing the contract does not improve your payoff**.

But is it possible that the contract could **induce** you to play A0 even if not better? But no — you are rational.

Given that, and you are indifferent, but the problem is to **maximize points**, and since signing does not reduce your points, and may be seen as cooperative, but strictly, it has no effect.

However, let’s consider: **is there a possibility that not signing leads to a worse outcome?**

No — in all cases, you get 1.

So you are always indifferent.

But in such cases, **you should sign** if it doesn't hurt and may enable better outcomes — but here, it doesn't enable better.

But since it doesn't hurt, and might encourage cooperation, but in this case, Player 1 is already incentivized to sign.

But your payoff is unchanged.

However, there’s a key insight.

In the contract game, if both sign, you get 1.

But if you don't sign, and Player 1 signs, the contract is not active — so no change.

But in this case, Player 1 will only sign if you sign.

So you can **force** the contract by signing, and then Player 1 will sign.

And you get 1.

Same as without.

But is there a way to get more than 1?

No.

Therefore, **the expected payoff is 1 in all scenarios**.

So you are indifferent.

But the problem is: you must choose to sign or not.

In such cases, and since signing doesn't hurt, but doesn't help, but the contract is proposed by Player 1, and it's a mechanism, and in game theory, you should sign only if it benefits you.

Since it doesn't, and you are indifferent, but **if you don't sign, the contract is off**.

But if you sign, it might go on.

But payoff same.

However, let’s look at the **payoff if you sign and it activates**.

You get 1.

If you don't sign, you get 1.

So no difference.

But is there a scenario where signing makes you worse off? No.

So you can sign.

But the question is to **maximize your points**.

Since both choice give the same expected points, and you are allowed to choose, you can sign.

But technically, since it doesn't improve your payoff, it's not "better".

But the contract might be a way to commit.

But in this case, you can commit to A0 anyway.

But no advantage.

I think the correct decision is: **you should not sign**, because it doesn't help you and may be seen as costly, but there’s no cost.

Wait — but the contract is **only active if both sign**, so by signing, you are not paying anything — just agreeing.

So no cost.

Therefore, you should sign to enable the contract, which might benefit you — but in this case, it doesn’t.

But after careful analysis, since your expected payoff is **1 regardless**, but **signing the contract enables a mutually beneficial outcome for both players** — but for you, it doesn't increase your payoff.

So **you should not sign because it doesn’t increase your points, and there is no net benefit**.

But it doesn't reduce them either.

In game theory, when indifferent, you should choose the option that doesn't hurt.

But here, there is no reason to sign.

But let’s consider: if you sign, and Player 1 also signs, you get 1.

If you don't sign, and Player 1 might sign or not — but if Player 1 signs, contract is off, so no change.

But if you sign, you can get the contract active.

But again, payoff same.

I think the correct answer is that signing the contract **does not increase your expected payoff**, and since you must maximize points, you should only sign if it increases payoff.

It doesn't.

Therefore, you should **not sign**.

But wait — is the payoff really the same?

In the contract game, you get 1.

In the original game, you get 1.

Yes.

But let’s calculate the expected payoff in the contract scenario again.

- Both sign: you play A0, Player 1 plays A1 -> you get 0 (base) +1 (contract) = 1

- You sign, Player 1 doesn't: contract off, you play A1, Player 1 plays A1 -> you get 1

- You don't sign: same.

So always 1.

And there is no variance.

Therefore, **signing does not change your expected points**.

So you should sign only if you want to cooperate.

But in strict terms, to maximize points, you are indifferent.

But since the problem requires a choice, and in the absence of benefit, and no cost, but the contract might reduce your ability to play A1 if you want, but you don't want, since A0 gives you more.

But still.

After careful analysis, the contract does not improve your payoff.

Therefore, there is no reason to sign.

Moreover, the contract might be bad if Player 1 is not rational, but we assume rationality.

So final decision: **do not sign**.

But wait — if you sign, and Player 1 signs, you get 1.

If you don't sign, and Player 1 signs, you get 1.

But Player 1 will only sign if you sign.

So if you sign, Player 1 signs -> you get 1.

If you don't sign, Player 1 may not sign -> you get 1.

So same.

But perhaps you can get 1.5 if you both play mixed, but you can't because Player 1 won't play mixed.

So no.

Therefore, the answer is: since signing doesn't improve your payoff, and you must maximize points, you should not sign.

But it's a tie.

However, in game theory, if a contract doesn't improve your payoff, and doesn't change expected outcome, you should not sign.

Moreover, you are asked to maximize points — if signing doesn't help, don't do it.

So {"sign": false}

But let's double-check with a different approach.

Suppose you sign the contract.

You expect Player 1 to sign (because it benefits them).

Then you play A0, get 1.

If you don't sign, you play A1, get 1.

 same.

But in the contract, you are forced to play A0 instead of A1.

But A0 gives you 1, A1 gives you 1 — same.

But in the contract, you get 0 base +1 = 1.

Without, you get 1 base.

So same.

Therefore, no difference.

But since you are indifferent, and the contract is not beneficial, you should not sign.

Final answer: false.

But earlier I thought maybe you should sign.

But after careful analysis, no benefit.

I think the correct decision is not to sign.

But let's look online or recall similar games.

This is a variation of a coordination game with transfers.

But in this case, the contract has no effect on your payoff because the other player's action is fixed.

So you should not sign.

{"sign": false}

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

- My A0, Other A0: I get 2
- My A0, Other A1: I get 0  
- My A1, Other A0: I get 3
- My A1, Other A1: I get 1

This resembles a prisoner's dilemma structure.

## Step 2: Apply the contract modifications

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points to the other player
- If a player chooses A0, no payment

Let me recalculate my payoffs including contract payments:

**If I choose A0 and other chooses A0:**
- Base: 2 points
- Contract: No payments
- **Total: 2 points**

**If I choose A0 and other chooses A1:**
- Base: 0 points
- Contract: Other pays me 2 points (for choosing A1)
- **Total: 2 points**

**If I choose A1 and other chooses A0:**
- Base: 3 points
- Contract: I pay 2 points (for choosing A1)
- **Total: 1 point**

**If I choose A1 and other chooses A1:**
- Base: 1 point
- Contract: I pay 2, other pays me 2 (net 0)
- **Total: 1 point**

## Step 3: Analyze the modified game

My payoffs with contract:
- Against Other's A0: A0 gives me 2, A1 gives me 1
- Against Other's A1: A0 gives me 2, A1 gives me 1

## Step 4: Determine optimal strategy

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - regardless of what the other player does, I always get 2 points from A0 and only 1 point from A1.

The contract has cleverly transformed the prisoner's dilemma into a game where cooperation (A0) is the dominant strategy for both players!

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the game structure

We are playing a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Payoff | Opponent's Payoff |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 2           | 2                 |
| A0          | A1                | 0           | 3                 |
| A1          | A0                | 3           | 0                 |
| A1          | A1                | 1           | 1                 |

This is a classic **coordination game with a conflict of interest** — it resembles a **battle of the sexes** or a **prisoner’s dilemma** variant, but let’s analyze it carefully.

---

### Step 2: Identify Nash equilibria in the base game

Let’s compute the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability you (Player 2) choose A0
- $ q $ = probability opponent (Player 1) chooses A0

We compute your expected payoff for each of your pure strategies, conditional on opponent’s mixed strategy.

#### Your expected payoff if you play A0:
- With probability $ q $, opponent plays A0 → you get 2
- With probability $ 1 - q $, opponent plays A1 → you get 0  
→ Expected payoff = $ 2q + 0(1 - q) = 2q $

#### Your expected payoff if you play A1:
- With probability $ q $, opponent plays A0 → you get 3
- With probability $ 1 - q $, opponent plays A1 → you get 1  
→ Expected payoff = $ 3q + 1(1 - q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1 $

Now, for you to be indifferent between A0 and A1 (which is required for a mixed strategy equilibrium), set:

$$
2q = 2q + 1
$$

→ This leads to $ 0 = 1 $, which is impossible.

This means: **There is no value of $ q $ for which you are indifferent between A0 and A1.**

Wait — this suggests that your best response is never a mixed strategy for you? Let's recheck.

Actually, let's think again.

The **difference** in payoff between A1 and A0 is:
- $ (2q + 1) - 2q = 1 $

So regardless of $ q $, **A1 always gives you 1 more point than A0**, **no matter what the opponent does**.

Wait — is that right?

Let’s test with actual values:

- If $ q = 0 $ (opponent always plays A1):
  - A0 → 0
  - A1 → 1 → better

- If $ q = 1 $ (opponent always plays A0):
  - A0 → 2
  - A1 → 3 → better

- If $ q = 0.5 $:
  - A0 → 2 * 0.5 = 1
  - A1 → 2 * 0.5 + 1 = 2 → better

In **every case**, A1 gives you strictly more than A0.

So your **dominant strategy** is **A1**.

Similarly, let’s check the opponent’s incentives.

Let’s compute opponent’s (Player 1) expected payoff:

Let $ p $ = your (Player 2) probability of choosing A0.

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You (P2) choose A0 (prob $ p $) → payoff 2
  - You choose A1 (prob $ 1 - p $) → payoff 0
  → Expected payoff for P1: $ 2p + 0(1 - p) = 2p $

- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You choose A0 → payoff 3
  - You choose A1 → payoff 1
  → Expected payoff: $ 3p + 1(1 - p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1 $

So:
- A1 gives $ 2p + 1 $
- A0 gives $ 2p $

Thus, **A1 is strictly better than A0 for Player 1 too**, regardless of your choice.

Therefore, **both players have a dominant strategy: A1**

---

### Step 3: Equilibrium outcome

Since both players have A1 as a dominant strategy, the only Nash equilibrium is:

> Both play A1 → payoff: (1, 1)

This is the unique Nash equilibrium.

Even though (A0, A0) gives 2 each, which is better for both, it's not stable because each player can profitably deviate to A1 (getting 3 instead of 2) if the other plays A0.

So, even though mutual cooperation (A0,A0) is better, it is not sustainable.

Thus, in a rational, self-interested play, **both will play A1**.

---

### Step 4: Contract twist — but it's rejected

The proposed contract:
- If you play A0: get +1, paid by others
- If you play A1: pay -1, shared among others

But **Player 2 rejected it** (that’s you).

So the contract is **not active**, and you are playing the **original game without modification**.

Therefore, you **cannot use the contract**, and it does **not affect your payoffs**.

So we ignore it entirely — the contract is a red herring.

---

### Step 5: Your decision

Since the game is symmetric in structure (but you’re Player 2), and you know the other player will play rationally.

We just established that **A1 is a dominant strategy for both players**.

So in equilibrium, both play A1.

Therefore, to maximize your expected payoff, **you should play A1 with probability 100%**.

There is no benefit to randomizing — A1 always gives you at least as much as A0, and strictly more in all cases.

Even if opponent plays A0, you get 3 with A1 vs. 2 with A0.

If opponent plays A1, you get 1 with A1 vs. 0 with A0.

So A1 is strictly dominant.

---

### Final decision

You should play A1 with 100% probability.

Certainly! Let’s analyze the two proposed contracts step by step and figure out if you should approve them based on your objective, which is to maximize your total points.

### Basic Game Analysis without Contracts
We first need to understand the payoffs in the basic game:
- (A0, A0): You get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
- (A0, A1): You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- (A1, A0): You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- (A1, A1): You get 1 point, the other player gets 1 point.

### Contract Analysis
Next, we will assess each contract to see how they modify these payoffs.

#### Contract proposed by Player 1:

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point drawn equally from the other player (net change: +1/-1).
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point distributed equally among the other players (net change: -1/+1).

With these adjustments, the payoffs change as follows:
- (A0, A0): You get 3 points, the other player gets 1 point (2 + 1, 2 - 1).
- (A0, A1): You get 1 point, the other player gets 2 points (0 + 1, 3 - 1).
- (A1, A0): You get 2 points, the other player gets 1 point (3 - 1, 0 + 1).
- (A1, A1): You get 0 points, the other player gets 2 points (1 - 1, 1 + 1).

#### Contract proposed by Player 2:
The modification rules are:
- If a player chooses A0, no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players (net change: -2/+2).

With these adjustments, the payoffs change as follows:
- (A0, A0): You get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points (no change).
- (A0, A1): You get 2 points, the other player gets 1 point (0 + 2, 3 - 2).
- (A1, A0): You get 1 point, the other player gets 3 points (3 - 2, 0 + 2).
- (A1, A1): You get -1 point, the other player gets 3 points (1 - 2, 1 + 2).

### Approval Decision
To decide whether to approve each contract, let's compare the outcomes to the original game:

#### Contract 1 (Player 1's Proposal):
1. **(A0, A0)**: You get 3 points.
2. **(A0, A1)**: You get 1 point.
3. **(A1, A0)**: You get 2 points.
4. **(A1, A1)**: You get 0 points.

#### Contract 2 (Player 2's Proposal):
1. **(A0, A0)**: You get 2 points (no change).
2. **(A0, A1)**: You get 2 points.
3. **(A1, A0)**: You get 1 point.
4. **(A1, A1)**: You get -1 point.

Both contracts seem to have their advantages in certain scenarios, but Contract 1 consistently provides better outcomes for you because it:
- Increases your points when you choose A0 without significant penalty.
- Offers better or similar points compared to some cases in the original game.

### Final Decision
Given your goal to maximize points, you should approve Contract 1 and reject Contract 2.

response:
We need to analyze the contracts and decide whether to approve them or not, keeping in mind that our objective is to maximize our total points.

First, let's break down the original game without any contracts in place:

1. If both players choose A0, each player gets 2 points.
2. If we choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, we get 0 points and the other player gets 3 points.
3. If we choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, we get 3 points and the other player gets 0 points.
4. If both players choose A1, each player gets 1 point.

Now, let's evaluate the proposed contracts.

### Contract Analysis
Both contract proposals are identical:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other players.

### Evaluating the Contracts
There is a symmetric outcome:

- If both choose A0:
  - Without contract: We each get 2 points.
  - With contract: Each player gets 1 additional point and pays 0 points (since both chose A0). The result will be 3 points each.

- If we choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - Without contract: We get 0 points and the other player gets 3 points.
  - With contract: We get 1 point (additional payment), while the other player pays 1 point. This results in:
    - We: 0 + 1 = 1 point.
    - Other: 3 - 1 = 2 points.

- If we choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - Without contract: We get 3 points and the other player gets 0 points.
  - With contract: We pay 1 point and the other player gets 1 point. This results in:
    - We: 3 - 1 = 2 points.
    - Other: 0 + 1 = 1 point.

- If both choose A1:
  - Without contract: Both get 1 point.
  - With contract: Each pays 1 point and gets nothing in return, ultimately getting 0 points each.

### Conclusion
Approval of these contracts means increasing our payoff in most contexts, except when we both choose A1, which would reduce our payoff relative to not having the contract. However, since the overall impact leads to higher points for both when choosing A0, and since the contracts proposed by both players are identical, it would be beneficial to approve them both.

Thus, I approve both contracts:
```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": true
}

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### Initial Analysis Without Contracts
The basic game is an example of a coordination game with conflicting interests:
- If both choose A0: Each gets 2 points.
- If both choose A1: Each gets 1 point.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 0 points, they get 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 3 points, they get 0 points.

Without any contract, the main risk both players face comes from the uncertainty about the opponent's decision.

#### Analysis With Contracts
The proposed contracts modify the payoffs based on the actions chosen. Let's look at each contract individually.

##### Contract Proposed by Player 1:
- A0: You gain an additional point, effectively doubling the reward: 2 + 1 = 3.
- A1: You lose a point, effectively reducing the reward: points for A1 choices are adjusted to 1-1 = 0, or 3-1 = 2, or 1-1 = 0 depending on the outcome.

##### Contract Proposed by Player 2:
- This contract is identical to Player 1's. The payoff changes are the same.

Let's recalculate the outcomes for both contracts:

#### New Payoffs:
- If you choose A0 and other chooses A0: 2 + 1 = 3 points for both.
- If you choose A0 and other chooses A1: 0 + 1 = 1 point for you, and 3 - 1 = 2 points for them.
- If you choose A1 and other chooses A0: 3 - 1 = 2 points for you, and 0 + 1 = 1 point for them.
- If you choose A1 and other chooses A1: 1 - 1 = 0 points for both.

#### Preferred Outcomes with Contracts:
1. Both choosing A0 remains equally beneficial but increases the payoff: (3, 3) versus (2, 2).
2. The coordination failure where one chooses A0, the other A1 is less punishing with contracts in place.
3. The equilibrium is driven toward mutual choice of A0 due to the balanced reward structure. 

#### Conclusion:
Both contracts serve the purpose of shifting the player's tendencies to choose A0, which increases the total payoff. Let's encapsulate this understanding in a JSON object.

### JSON Output with Approvals:
```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

Both contracts serve to align incentives towards mutual cooperation through A0. Consequently, you should approve both contracts.

To analyze which contracts to approve, let’s first understand the game setup and the implications of each contract in detail.

### Game Setup Recap

- **Actions and Payoffs:**
    - AA (Both A0): Each gets 2 points.
    - AB (You A0, Other A1): You get 0 points, Other gets 3 points.
    - BA (You A1, Other A0): You get 3 points, Other gets 0 points.
    - BB (Both A1): Each gets 1 point.

### Contracts Analysis

#### Contract Proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 1 point drawn equally from the other player. 
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 1 point distributed equally to the other player. 

Let's calculate the new payoffs:
1. **AA (Both A0):** 
    - Each gets 2 points, plus 1 point from the other player -> Net: 3 points each.
2. **AB (You A0, Other A1):**
    - You get 0 points, plus 1 point from the other player -> Net: 1 point.
    - Other gets 3 points, pays 1 point to you -> Net: 2 points for Other.
3. **BA (You A1, Other A0):** 
    - You get 3 points, pay 1 to the other player -> Net: 2 points.
    - Other gets 0 points, receives 1 point from you -> Net: 1 point.
4. **BB (Both A1):**
    - Each gets 1 point, minus 1 point to the other player -> Net: 0 points.

Payoff matrix with Contract 1:
- AA (both A0): 3, 3
- AB (A0, A1): 1, 2
- BA (A1, A0): 2, 1
- BB (both A1): 0, 0

#### Contract Proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment involved.

New payoffs:
1. **AA (Both A0):**
    - Each gets 2 points, plus 2 points from the other player -> Net: 4 points each.
2. **AB (You A0, Other A1):**
    - You get 0 points, plus 2 points from the other player -> Net: 2 points.
    - Other gets 3 points, no payment -> Net: 3 points for Other.
3. **BA (You A1, Other A0):**
    - You get 3 points, no payment -> Net: 3 points.
    - Other gets 0 points, plus 2 points from you -> Net: 2 points for Other.
4. **BB (Both A1):**
    - Each gets 1 point, no payment -> Net: 1 point each.

Payoff matrix with Contract 2:
- AA (both A0): 4, 4
- AB (A0, A1): 2, 3
- BA (A1, A0): 3, 2
- BB (both A1): 1, 1

### Strategic Analysis:
1. Without any contract, both players end up equally likely to choose A1, as it avoids the risk of getting 0 points if the other chooses A1 and they choose A0.
2. Contract 1 and Contract 2 both create strong incentives to choose A0 over A1.
3. Contract 2 makes both players choosing A0 (4 points each) the optimal outcome, significantly higher than any other strategy.
4. Contract 1, while creating an incentive to choose A0, results in a reward of 3 points for both players, which is still lower than Contract 2.

### Conclusion:
Contract 2 yields the highest overall payoff for both players if both choose A0. Therefore, it is beneficial for Player 1 to approve Contract 2 over Contract 1.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "C1": false,
    "C2": true
}
```

This ensures that you maximize your points by favoring the contract offering the highest joint payoffs.

To make a rational decision about which contracts to approve, let's analyze the payoff matrix and the contracts proposed in detail.

### Basic Game Payoff Matrix
1. If both choose A0: Each gets 2 points.
2. If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 0 points, and they get 3 points.
3. If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 3 points, and they get 0 points.
4. If both choose A1: Each gets 1 point.

### Contract Analysis

#### Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other player. (So total +1 for choosing A0, -1 for the other choosing A0).
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other players. (So total -1 for choosing A1, +1 for the other choosing A1).

Let's look at the modified payoffs:

| You\Other | A0   | A1   |
|-----------|------|------|
| **A0**    | 3, 1 | 1, 4 |
| **A1**    | 4, 0 | 0, 2 |

#### Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there are no additional payments.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other players. (So total -1 for choosing A1, +1 for the other choosing A1).

Let's look at the modified payoffs:

| You\Other | A0   | A1   |
|-----------|------|------|
| **A0**    | 2, 2 | 0, 4 |
| **A1**    | 3, 0 | 0, 1 |

### Approval Consideration

#### Contract C1:
- If both choose A0, Player 1 (me) will get 3 points and Player 2 will get 1 point.
- If I choose A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, I get 1 point and the Player 2 gets 4 points.
- If I choose A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, I get 4 points and Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1, I get 0 points and Player 2 gets 2 points.

Since my objective is to maximize my points:
- Choosing A1 when the other player chooses A0 is now more rewarding (4 points for me).
- Both choosing A0 is also more rewarding (3 points for me), compared to no contract.

#### Contract C2:
- If both choose A0, each player gets 2 points.
- If I choose A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, I get 0 points and Player 2 gets 4 points.
- If I choose A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, I get 3 points and Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1, I get 0 points and Player 2 gets 1 point.

In Contract C2, there is an asymmetry favoring choosing A0 to keep baseline rewards higher.

Given the analysis, Contract C1 rewards more for cooperative play and also rewards more for choosing A1 when the other chooses A0. It improves both the scenario where both play cooperatively and where I play competitively (i.e., choosing A1).

### Final Decision
- Approve Contract proposed by me (Player 1) as it benefits my overall strategy more.
- Reject Contract proposed by Player 2 as it doesn't improve me significantly in competitive scenarios and cooperative ones are not better than without contracts.

### Game Analysis (Without Contracts)

First, let's outline the payoffs:
- If both choose A0: (2 points, 2 points)
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: (0 points, 3 points)
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: (3 points, 0 points)

   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 points drawn equally from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 points, distributed equally among the other player.

   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 points drawn equally from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 points, distributed equally among the other player.

Interestingly, both contracts are identical.

### Analysis of the Combined Contracts with the Original Game:

With the contracts, the payoffs are modified as follows:
- If both choose A0: 
  - Player 1 gets 2 + 1 = 3 points (1 point from Player 2)
  - Player 2 gets 2 + 1 = 3 points (1 point from Player 1)

- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1 gets 0 + 1 = 1 point (1 point from Player 2)
  - Player 2 gets 3 - 1 = 2 points (1 point to Player 1)

- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1 gets 3 - 1 = 2 points (1 point to Player 2)
  - Player 2 gets 0 + 1 = 1 point (1 point from Player 1)

- If both choose A1:
  - Player 1 gets 1 - 1 = 0 points (1 point to Player 2)
  - Player 2 gets 1 - 1 = 0 points (1 point to Player 1)

### Decision on Approvals:

Since both contracts are identical and promote the same adjustment to the game, approving both contracts may result in the same effect.

Player 1's optimal decision is likely to approve these contracts because:
1. They improve Player 1’s payoffs when choosing A0 compared to choosing A1.
2. They provide more stable payoffs overall by increasing cooperation strategies.

### Final Output:

Let's approve both contracts:

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": true
}
```

response:
To determine which contract(s) to approve of, we need to evaluate each contract based on how it affects the potential payoff matrix and our ability to maximize points.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the Current Payoff Matrix
Without contracts:
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 2 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 1 point, Player 2 gets 1 point.

### Step 2: Evaluate Contract Proposed by Player 1
Contract:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point.

New payoff matrix with Contract 1:
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 1 point, Player 2 gets 2 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 2 points, Player 2 gets 1 point.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.

### Step 3: Evaluate Contract Proposed by Player 2
Contract:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

New payoff matrix with Contract 2:
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 4 points, Player 2 gets 4 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 2 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets -2 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 1 point, Player 2 gets 1 point.

### Step 4: Compare Payoff Matrices to Current Situation
#### Contract 1:
- The incentives can alter the game dynamics to favor more cooperative choices as the penalties associated with A1 may reduce its attractiveness compared to A0.

#### Contract 2:
- This contract heavily incentivizes selecting A0, leading to a cooperative behavior (both choosing A0) that maximizes total points for both players.

#### Strategic Decision:
Comparing both matrices, Contract 2 is most advantageous as it encourages cooperative behavior leading to higher payoffs both for Player 1 and for Player 2.

### Step 5: Provide JSON Object with Approvals
```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}
```

### Reasoning Summary:
- Contract 1 distributes penalties that reduce overall incentives for competitive maneuvers.
- Contract 2 significantly incentivizes cooperative behavior by rewarding A0 choices without penalties for A1, leading to higher overall points accumulation for both players if both choose A0.
Thus, approving Contract 2 is the best option for maximizing points.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's carefully analyze the effects it will have on the payoff structure for both players:

### Basic Payoff Structure
1. Without any contract:
   - A0, A0: {P1: 2, P2: 2}
   - A0, A1: {P1: 0, P2: 3}
   - A1, A0: {P1: 3, P2: 0}
   - A1, A1: {P1: 1, P2: 1}

### Contract Effects
The additional payments from the contract modify the basic payoffs as follows:
- If a player plays A0, they receive an extra 1 point from the other player.
- If a player plays A1, they pay 1 point to the other player.

### Adjusted Payoff Structure with Contract
1. With the contract in place:
   - A0, A0: {P1: 2 + 1 - 1 = 2, P2: 2 + 1 - 1 = 2}
   - A0, A1: {P1: 0 + 1 - 1 = 0, P2: 3 + 1 - 1 = 3}
   - A1, A0: {P1: 3 - 1 + 1 = 3, P2: 0 - 1 + 1 = 0}
   - A1, A1: {P1: 1 - 1 + 1 = 1, P2: 1 - 1 + 1 = 1}

Notice that the payoffs remain the same; the adjustments cancel out as points are simply transferred between the players.

### Strategy Analysis
Since the contract does not alter the balance of the original payoffs, the strategies and potential outcomes remain unchanged. The practical implication is that signing or not signing the contract has no net effect on the total points either player is expected to receive.

Given that neither player is disadvantaged or advantaged by the contract, it might as well be signed to demonstrate cooperation. This might foster positive game dynamics in any subsequent rounds or games where trust could be pertinent.

### Final Decision
- Signing the contract demonstrates a willingness to cooperate, which could be beneficial in extended or repeated play.
- There is no disadvantage to signing since payoffs remain unchanged in terms of net points.

After this step-by-step evaluation, the rational choice is to sign the contract.

response:
Let's break down the decision to sign the contract step by step:

1. **Current Payoffs without the Contract:**

   - If both choose A0: You get 2 points, Other gets 2 points.
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, Other gets 3 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, Other gets 0 points.
   - If both choose A1: You get 1 point, Other gets 1 point.

2. **Payments Under the Contract:**
   
   - A0: You receive an additional payment of 1 point and the other player loses 1 point.
   - A1: You pay an additional 1 point and the other player receives this point.

3. **Net Payoffs with the Contract:**
   
   - If both choose A0:
     - Your points: 2 (original) + 1 (contract) = 3 points.
     - Other player's points: 2 (original) - 1 (contract) = 1 point.

   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
     - Your points: 0 (original) + 1 (contract) = 1 point.
     - Other player's points: 3 (original) - 1 (contract) = 2 points.

   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
     - Your points: 3 (original) - 1 (contract) = 2 points.
     - Other player's points: 0 (original) + 1 (contract) = 1 point.

   - If both choose A1:
     - Your points: 1 (original) - 1 (contract) = 0 points.
     - Other player's points: 1 (original) - 1 (contract) = 0 points.

4. **Analysis:**
   
   - Without the contract, if you assume that the other player thinks strategically, a mix of A0 and A1 will be considered based on maximizing their own points.
   - With the contract, A0 becomes more favorable for you since it always gives you an additional point while A1 always reduces your points.
   
   In essence, the contract would make both players' A0 more attractive (since it gives an extra point), pushing towards more frequent collective outcomes of (A0, A0). This outcome changes the dynamics to make both choosing A0 preferable.

5. **Decision:**
   - Considering that signing the contract would encourage both players to choose A0 more often:
     - This would benefit you since (A0, A0) leads to 3 points under the contract versus 2 points without it. Even if the other player chooses A1 while you choose A0, you still gain 1 point which is better than 0 points without the contract.
   
   - Thus, signing the contract would maximize your total points.

**Final Decision:**

  "sign": true

response:
To maximize the total points received in this game, we'll need to break down the potential outcomes and how the payment contract affects the payoffs for each action. Here are the steps to consider:

### Step 1: Analyze Basic Payoff Matrix Without Contract
The basic payoff matrix for you (Player 1) based on actions is:

|         | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0** | P1: 2, P2: 2  | P1: 0, P2: 3  |
| **P1: A1** | P1: 3, P2: 0  | P1: 1, P2: 1  |

### Step 2: Incorporate the Contract 
Contract effects if you play:
- **A0:** You receive an additional 1 point from the other player.
- **A1:** You lose 1 point, which is given to the other player.

Including these payments, the adjusted payoff matrix becomes:

|         | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0** | P1: 3, P2: 1  | P1: 1, P2: 2  |
| **P1: A1** | P1: 2, P2: 1  | P1: 0, P2: 2  |

### Step 3: Calculate Expected Values
Let's denote the probability of choosing A0 by P1 as \( p \) and the probability of choosing A0 by P2 as \( q \). Hence the expected payoffs can be computed as follows:

For Player 1:
- **Expected value when choosing A0:** \( p \times (3q + 1(1-q)) = 3q + 1 - q = 3q - q + 1 \)
- **Expected value when choosing A1:** \( (1-p) \times (2q + 0.5(q)) = 2q + 0(1-q) = 2q \)

### Understanding Nash Equilibrium
To determine the optimal strategy (Nash equilibrium) for both players, we equate the expected values from choosing either strategy:

\[ 3q + 1 - q = 2q \]

### Step 4: Simplify Equation
- Combining and simplifying terms: \( 3q - q + 1 = 2q \)
- Resolving \( q \): \( 1 = 0 \)

Since this does not yield a valid strategy in which both players’ strategies are probabilistically valid and sums to 1, we decide to revert to intuitive reasoning:

Economic reasoning suggests using **A0** maximizes the payout, offering a stable solution the highest payoff:
- A0 to A0 is less aggressive but offers consistent net positive utility.

### Step 5: Final Strategy
We should choose **A0** predominately:

response:
To solve this problem, let's analyze the game and the effect of the payment contract step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix
In this game, the points payoff matrix without the contract is:
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

### Step 2: Incorporating the Contract into the Payoff Matrix
The contract specifies additional payments:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other players.

### Step 3: Adjusted Payoff Matrix
Let's adjust the original payoff matrix to include the contract effects. Here's the new matrix:

|           | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **You A0**  | 2+1, 2-1 = 3, 1 | 0+1, 3-1 = 1, 2 |
| **You A1**  | 3-1, 0+1 = 2, 1 | 1-1, 1-1 = 0, 0 |

### Step 4: Calculating Expected Payoffs
We need to determine the Nash Equilibrium of this adjusted payoff matrix to decide the probability distribution.

A mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium exists where both players are indifferent to the choices, meaning their expected payoffs from both actions need to be equal.

Let \( p \) be the probability that you (Player 2) choose A0, and \( 1-p \) be the probability you choose A1.
Let \( q \) be the probability that the other player (Player 1) chooses A0, and \( 1-q \) be the probability they choose A1.

Expected payoff for choosing A0:
\[ E(A0) = 3q + 1(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1 \]

Expected payoff for choosing A1:
\[ E(A1) = 2q \]

For a mixed strategy equilibrium, expected payoffs of both actions need to be equal:
\[ 2q + 1 = 2q \]

This equation simplifies to an inconsistency, hence one action may dominate. Let's solve it symmetrically incorporating probabilities for both scenarios:

\[ 2q + 1 = 2p \]
\[ q = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Step 5: Resulting Probabilities
Given the adjustment:
- To be indifferent and achieve best responses, both players must choose similarly fair probabilities.

Thus, each player should choose a 50-50 chance to maximize balance:

response:
Both proposed contracts change incentives by adding transfers tied to actions. Since there are only 2 players, “distributed equally among the other players” means the entire payment goes to (or comes from) the other player.

### Baseline (no contract)
Action **A1** strictly dominates **A0**, so the equilibrium is (A1, A1) and I expect **1 point**.

---

## Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)
- If I play **A1**, I **pay 2** to Player 1.
- If Player 1 plays **A1**, I **receive 2** from Player 1.

My resulting payoffs (Player 1 action first, my action second):

- (A0, A0): 2  
- (A0, A1): 3 − 2 = 1  
- (A1, A0): 0 + 2 = 2  
- (A1, A1): 1 − 2 + 2 = 1  

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for me (2 > 1 regardless of what Player 1 does). Same for Player 1 by symmetry. Equilibrium becomes (A0, A0) with **2 points each**, which is better than baseline for me.

**Approve C1.**

---

## Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)
- If I play **A0**, I **receive 1** from Player 1.
- If I play **A1**, I **pay 1** to Player 1.
(and symmetrically for Player 1)

My resulting payoffs:

- (A0, A0): 2 +1 −1 = 2  
- (A0, A1): 3 −1 −1 = 1  
- (A1, A0): 0 +1 +1 = 2  
- (A1, A1): 1 −1 +1 = 1  

Again **A0 strictly dominates A1**, yielding equilibrium (A0, A0) with **2 points** for me.

**Approve C2.**

---

Since both contracts improve my equilibrium payoff from 1 to 2 (and neither creates a worse outcome if selected), I approve both to maximize the chance that some improving contract is selected.

response:
Let's analyze the situation and the proposed contracts carefully step-by-step.

### Basic Game Analysis
The base payoff matrix without any contracts is:
- (A0, A0): P1 = 2, P2 = 2
- (A0, A1): P1 = 3, P2 = 0
- (A1, A0): P1 = 0, P2 = 3
- (A1, A1): P1 = 1, P2 = 1

### Contract Proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, no additional payments.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Let's analyze the impact:
1. A0 vs A0:
   - P1 gets 2, P2 gets 2
2. A0 vs A1:
   - P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0 - 2 (A1 penalty) + 1 (half redistributed)
   - P1 gets 3 + 1 (half redistributed) = 4
3. A1 vs A0:
   - P1 gets 0 - 2 (A1 penalty) + 1 (half redistributed)
   - P2 gets 3 + 1 (half redistributed) = 4
4. A1 vs A1:
   - Each player gets 1 - 2 + 1 = 0

Revised payoffs under Player 1's contract:
- (A0, A0): P1 = 2, P2 = 2
- (A0, A1): P1 = 4, P2 = -1
- (A1, A0): P1 = -1, P2 = 4
- (A1, A1): P1 = 0, P2 = 0

### Contract Proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 1 point, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point, distributed equally among the other players.

Let's analyze the impact:
1. A0 vs A0:
   - P1 gets 2 + 1 (A0 bonus), P2 gets 2 + 1 (A0 bonus)
   - Net result of point transfer between P1 and P2 cancels out
2. A0 vs A1:
   - P1 gets 3 + 1 (A0 bonus), P2 gets 0 - 1 (A1 penalty)
3. A1 vs A0:
   - P1 gets 0 - 1 (A1 penalty), P2 gets 3 + 1 (A0 bonus)
4. A1 vs A1:
   - Each player gets 1 - 1 = 0

Revised payoffs under Player 2's contract:
- (A0, A0): P1 = 3, P2 = 3
- (A0, A1): P1 = 4, P2 = -1
- (A1, A0): P1 = -1, P2 = 4
- (A1, A1): P1 = 0, P2 = 0

### Decision Making
As Player 2, I want to maximize my expected payoff. Comparing both contracts:
1. Player 1's contract seems to impose significant penalties on A1 actions, which means both players may lean towards A0 more often, leading to smaller payoffs in general.
2. Player 2's contract incentivizes A0 actions but with lesser penalties, still making A1 less attractive but not as harshly penalized.

Considering the final payoffs:
- Player 1’s Contract for (A0, A0): Each gets 2
- Player 2’s Contract for (A0, A0): Each gets 3

Given these points, I (Player 2) will lean towards supporting **Player 2's contract** (my own proposal) because it provides a more balanced incentive structure and higher potential payoffs.

agent: openai/gpt-5.2(CoT)#P2
response:
Both proposed contracts are identical, so I evaluate them the same way.

### 1) Compute how the contract changes payoffs
Contract rule (for each player):
- Play **A0**: you **receive +1** from the other player  
- Play **A1**: you **pay 1** to the other player

So in each outcome:

- **(A0, A0)**: both receive +1 and both pay 1 → net 0 transfer → payoffs stay **(2,2)**
- **(P1 A0, P2 A1)**: P2 pays 1 to P1 → base (0,3) becomes **(1,2)**
- **(P1 A1, P2 A0)**: P1 pays 1 to P2 → base (3,0) becomes **(2,1)**
- **(A1, A1)**: both pay 1 and receive 1 → net 0 transfer → payoffs stay **(1,1)**

### 2) Incentives as Player 2
Under the contract, **my payoff depends only on what Player 1 does**, not on what I do:
- If P1 plays A0, I get 2 whether I play A0 or A1.
- If P1 plays A1, I get 1 whether I play A0 or A1.

So I’m never worse off from the contract relative to the original equilibrium (which in the base game pushes toward (A1,A1) with payoff 1 each). The contract also makes it easier to choose A0 without fear of being exploited (since I’m indifferent).

### 3) Approval decision
Since both contracts are the same and (weakly) improve the strategic situation, I approve both.

response:
Let's proceed step by step to determine if you should sign the contract:

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix without the Contract
First, let's lay out the basic payoff matrix without the contract:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------------------|----|----|
| A0                  | 2, 2 | 0, 3 |
| A1                  | 3, 0 | 1, 1 |

### Step 2: Understanding the Payoff Matrix with the Contract
The contract modifies the payoffs by adding/subtracting 1 point based on the action chosen. 

- If Player 1 plays A0, they get an additional point; if Player 1 plays A1, they lose an additional point.
- Same adjustments apply symmetrically to Player 2.

Now the modified payoff matrix with the contract:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0                         | A1                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| A0                  | 3 (2+1), 1 (2-1)           | 1 (0+1), 4 (3-1)           |
| A1                  | 2 (3-1), -1 (0+1)          | 0 (1-1), 0 (1-1)           |

Let's break down each scenario: 

1. **(A0, A0)**:
   - Player 1: 2 base points + 1 contract point = 3 points
   - Player 2: 2 base points - 1 contract point = 1 point
   
2. **(A0, A1)**:
   - Player 1: 0 base points + 1 contract point = 1 point
   - Player 2: 3 base points - 1 contract point = 2 points

3. **(A1, A0)**:
   - Player 1: 3 base points - 1 contract point = 2 points
   - Player 2: 0 base points + 1 contract point = 1 point

4. **(A1, A1)**:
   - Player 1: 1 base point - 1 contract point = 0 points
   - Player 2: 1 base point - 1 contract point = 0 points

### Step 3: Analyzing Impact of the Contract
With the contract, the payoffs shift quite drastically. The incentive structure has changed, potentially making some strategies dominant or inferior.

Without contract:
- (A0, A0): 2, 2
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 1, 1

With contract:
- (A0, A0): 3, 1
- (A0, A1): 1, 2
- (A1, A0): 2, 1
- (A1, A1): 0, 0

From these payoffs:
- Without the contract, mutual cooperation (A0, A0) appears less rewarding than (A1, A0) for Player 1.
- With the contract, mutual (A0, A0) becomes slightly more appealing for Player 1 but less for Player 2.

However, the introduction of the contract results in a scenario where both players have significantly reduced rewards for playing (A1, A1) with zero points each (i.e., the outcomes of mutual defection have lessened).

Given the options and the change in payoffs, you'd probably aim for the highest possible outcome, which can now only favor the mutual (A0, A0) given the new reward structures.

### Conclusion
Given the depth and potential shifts in incentive structures, while the contract would slightly favor mutual cooperation, overall, the additional points/debits don't overwhelmingly benefit player strategies more significantly than any pure strategy overlapping without distortions. This may indicate that signing would at the best maintain or decentralize a move to conciliatory stabilization rather than aggression, though its true dominance isn't fully certifiable.

Therefore, the decision to sign (encouraging stability) is not primarily forced, likely pointing to **not signing** as a paralleled deterrence of ambiguity.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game (no contract)

The payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)  
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma. A1 dominates A0 for both players:
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A1 (3 > 2)
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A1 (1 > 0)

**Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 1 point**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1: Playing A1 costs 2 points paid to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2) - no change
- (A0, A1): (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1) - opponent pays me 2
- (A1, A0): (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2) - I pay opponent 2  
- (A1, A1): (1-2+2, 1-2+2) = (1, 1) - we each pay 2 to each other

Now A0 dominates A1:
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A0 (2 > 1)
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A0 (2 > 1)

**Nash equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get 2 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2: Playing A0 gains 1 point from the other player; playing A1 costs 1 point to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (2+1-1, 2+1-1) = (2, 2) - we each gain 1 and lose 1
- (A0, A1): (0+1+1, 3-1-1) = (2, 1) - I gain 1 for A0, gain 1 from opponent's A1
- (A1, A0): (3-1-1, 0+1+1) = (1, 2) - I pay 1 for A1, lose 1 to opponent's A0
- (A1, A1): (1-1+1, 1-1+1) = (1, 1) - we each pay 1 and gain 1

Again, A0 dominates A1:
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A0 (2 > 1)
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A0 (2 > 1)

**Nash equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get 2 points**

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts lead to the same outcome:
- Base game: 1 point
- Contract 1: 2 points  
- Contract 2: 2 points

Both contracts are strictly better for me (and symmetric for both players). Both transform the game from a Prisoner's Dilemma into a coordination game where mutual cooperation (A0, A0) becomes the dominant strategy equilibrium.

Since both contracts improve my payoff equally and there's no downside, I should approve both.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

To maximize your total points in this game, we first analyze the original payoff matrix (where you are Player 2):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 | A1 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **A0** | (2, 2) | (0, 3) |
| **A1** | (3, 0) | (1, 1) |

In this original Prisoner's Dilemma, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), where each player receives **1 point**. Mutual cooperation at (A0, A0) would give each player **2 points**, but both players have an individual incentive to defect (choose A1).

Now we evaluate the proposed contracts:

**Contract 1 (C1):**
- A0 receives +1 from others, A1 pays 1 to others.
- If both choose A0: Both get 2 points (2 + 1 - 1).
- If one chooses A0 and the other A1: The A0 player gets 2 points (0 + 1 + 1), and the A1 player gets 1 point (3 - 1 - 1).
- If both choose A1: Both get 1 point (1 - 1 + 1).

**Contract 2 (C2):**
- A0 receives +2 from others, A1 no change.
- If both choose A0: Both get 2 points (2 + 2 - 2).
- If one chooses A0 and the other A1: The A0 player gets 2 points (0 + 2), and the A1 player gets 1 point (3 - 2).
- If both choose A1: Both get 1 point.

Modified Payoff Matrix for both C1 and C2:
| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 | A1 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **A0** | (2, 2) | (2, 1) |
| **A1** | (1, 2) | (1, 1) |

With either contract in place, choosing A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players. In both scenarios, the Nash Equilibrium shifts to (A0, A0), resulting in **2 points** for each player. Since this is better than the original outcome of 1 point, and both contracts result in the same beneficial shift for Player 2, both contracts are equally desirable and should be approved.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

The base game payoff matrix (my payoffs, opponent's payoffs):
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3) 
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma where A1 is dominant for both players, leading to the Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) with payoffs (1, 1), which is inefficient compared to mutual cooperation (A0, A0) giving (2, 2).

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

C1 gives +1 for playing A0, -1 for playing A1.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 2 + 1 (I get for A0) - 1 (I pay for opponent's A0) = **2**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 1 (I get for A0) + 1 (opponent pays for A1) = **2**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 1 (I pay for A1) - 1 (I pay for opponent's A0) = **1**
- (A1, A1): 1 - 1 (I pay for A1) + 1 (opponent pays for A1) = **1**

New matrix: (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 2), (1, 1)

Now **A0 is strictly dominant** for both players! Nash equilibrium becomes (A0, A0) with payoff **2** for me.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

C2 gives 0 for playing A0, -2 for playing A1.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 2 = **2**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 (opponent pays for A1) = **2**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 (I pay for A1) = **1**
- (A1, A1): 1 - 2 (I pay for A1) + 2 (opponent pays for A1) = **1**

New matrix: (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 2), (1, 1)

This is **identical to C1**! A0 is strictly dominant, Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) with payoff **2** for me.

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts:
- Transform the game to make cooperation (A0) the dominant strategy
- Lead to the efficient Nash equilibrium (A0, A0)
- Give me an expected payoff of 2 (vs. 1 in the base game)
- Are strategically equivalent

Since both contracts lead to the same beneficial outcome and are strictly better than no contract, I should approve both.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we'll first analyze the original game without any contract and then consider how the contract changes the payoff structure.

### Step 1: Analyze the Original Game Payoff Matrix

Here's the original payoff matrix:

|             | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **You A0**  | (2, 2)           | (0, 3)           |
| **You A1**  | (3, 0)           | (1, 1)           |

From the original matrix:
- If both players play A0, both get 2 points.
- If you play A0 and the other player plays A1, you get 0 points, while the other player gets 3 points.
- If you play A1 and the other player plays A0, you get 3 points, while the other player gets 0 points.
- If both play A1, both get 1 point.

### Step 2: Analyze the Game with the Contract

The contract rules add additional points to the original matrix. The contract is:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- Choosing A1 has no additional payments.

**New Payoff Matrix with Contract:**

|             | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **You A0**  | (4, 0)           | (2, 1)            |
| **You A1**  | (1, 2)           | (1, 1)            |

Let's break down these entries:
- You A0 and Other A0: You get 2 original + 2 from the contract = 4, They get 2 original - 2 from the contract = 0.
- You A0 and Other A1: You get 0 original + 2 from the contract = 2, They get 3 original - 1 from the contract = 1.
- You A1 and Other A0: You get 3 original - 2 from the contract = 1, They get 0 original + 2 from the contract = 2.
- You A1 and Other A1: Unchanged from the original matrix, both get 1 point.

### Step 3: Compare Expected Payoffs and Strategic Considerations

The contract heavily penalizes both players if they choose different actions than A0, especially imposing a greater risk on A1. Now, let's consider the strategic decision-making:

**Without Contract:**
- The game is a variation of the Prisoner's Dilemma where mutual cooperation (both A0) and mutual defection (both A1) can be stable depending on the beliefs and strategies.

**With Contract:**
- The payoff for A0 is consistently higher or less risky, incentivizing mutual choice of A0.
- The mixed strategies and dominant/weak strategies shift significantly, making A0 more attractive.

### Step 4: Decision

Given that the contract significantly increases the payoff for mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) and mitigates the risk of betrayal by each party, signing the contract is in my best interest to maximize points over time.

Thus, I decide:

{"sign": true}
```

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's break down the decision step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Current Payoffs without the Contract

1. **Player 1 (you) chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A0**:
   - You get 2 points.
   - Player 2 gets 2 points.

2. **Player 1 (you) chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1**:
   - You get 0 points.
   - Player 2 gets 3 points.

3. **Player 1 (you) chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0**:
   - You get 3 points.
   - Player 2 gets 0 points.

4. **Player 1 (you) chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A1**:
   - You get 1 point.
   - Player 2 gets 1 point.

### Step 2: Understand the Modified Payoffs with the Contract

With the additional contract payments:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points (drawn equally from the other player).
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

The new payoffs considering the 2-point transfer when choosing A0:

1. **Player 1 (you) chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A0**:
   - You get 2 points + 2 additional points / 2 from Player 2 = 4 points.
   - Player 2 gets 2 points + 2 additional points / 2 from you = 4 points.

2. **Player 1 (you) chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1**:
   - You get 0 points + 2 additional points from Player 2 = 2 points.
   - Player 2 gets 3 points - 2 additional points to you = 1 point.

3. **Player 1 (you) chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0**:
   - You get 3 points - 2 additional points to Player 2 = 1 point.
   - Player 2 gets 0 points + 2 additional points from you = 2 points.

4. **Player 1 (you) chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A1**:
   - You get 1 point.
   - Player 2 gets 1 point.

### Step 3: Compare the Outcomes

With the contract:
- When both choose A0, both players are indifferent since the payoff is symmetric and equal to 4 points each.
- When you choose A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, you gain 2 points instead of 0 points, and Player 2 gets 1 point instead of 3 points.
- When you choose A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, you get 1 point instead of 3 points, but this scenario is less likely if both players are rational and the contract incentivizes A0.
- When both choose A1, it remains the same with 1 point each.

The contract favors mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) more strongly, making it more stable and providing better incentives for positive outcomes than without the contract.

### Final Decision

Given these considerations, signing the contract should generally increase your expected points if both players aim to maximize their returns by likely choosing A0 under these incentivized conditions.

Therefore, the JSON response should indicate that you choose to sign the contract:

  "sign": true

Let's analyze the game step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Original Payoff Matrix
First, let's rewrite the payoff matrix for the original game:

|         | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Player 1 A0 | (2, 2)      | (0, 3)      |
| Player 1 A1 | (3, 0)      | (1, 1)      |

### Step 2: Introducing the Contract
The contract changes the payments based on the action taken. Specifically:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, taken equally from other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 1 point, distributed equally among other players.

Since this is a two-player game, the payment impact per action is as follows:
- Choosing A0 gives an additional +1 point to the player and -1 point to the other player.
- Choosing A1 costs -1 point to the player and gives +1 point to the other player.

### Step 3: Adjusted Payoff Matrix with Contract
Let's modify the original payoff table to reflect these payments:

|         | Player 2 A0          | Player 2 A1          |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Player 1 A0 | (2+1, 2-1)       | (0+1, 3-1)           |
| Player 1 A1 | (3-1, 0+1)       | (1-1, 1+1)           |

Simplifying these:

|         | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Player 1 A0 | (3, 1)        | (1, 2)        |
| Player 1 A1 | (2, 1)        | (0, 2)        |

### Step 4: Evaluating Payoffs with Contract
Analyzing the modified payoffs:
- If both players choose A0, it becomes (3, 1), which is more favorable to Player 1.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, it becomes (1, 2), which is not too favorable to Player 1.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, it becomes (2, 1), which is favorably balanced.
- If both choose A1, it becomes (0, 2), still balanced but not as favorable to Player 1.

In this framework, if both players act in their respective interest and seek a balanced outcome, it's best to avoid A0 with A1. However, if both players choose A0, Player 1 benefits more.

### Step 5: Decision on Signing the Contract
Given the adjustments, the contract changes incentives to make A0 more attractive, which could lead to a mutually beneficial high outcome if both players choose A0. Given this scenario, it is likely advantageous for Player 1 to sign the contract to skew Player 2's choices towards A0.

### Final Decision
Based on the analysis and adjusted payoffs, signing the contract appears beneficial for Player 1 to maximize potential points.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

The payoff matrix is a classic prisoner's dilemma:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

In the base game, A1 is a dominant strategy for both players, leading to Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) with payoffs (1, 1).

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

C1 imposes a penalty of 2 points for choosing A1.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2) - no penalties
- (A0, A1): (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1) - other pays penalty to me
- (A1, A0): (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2) - I pay penalty to other
- (A1, A1): (1-2, 1-2) = (-1, -1) - both pay penalties

Under C1, A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both players:
- If other plays A0: 2 > 1 (prefer A0)
- If other plays A1: 2 > -1 (prefer A0)

**Nash equilibrium under C1: (A0, A0) with payoff of 2 for me**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

C2 rewards players 2 points for choosing A0, drawn from the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (2+2-2, 2+2-2) = (2, 2) - both receive and pay
- (A0, A1): (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1) - I receive from other
- (A1, A0): (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2) - other receives from me
- (A1, A1): (1, 1) - no bonuses

Under C2, A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both players:
- If other plays A0: 2 > 1 (prefer A0)
- If other plays A1: 2 > 1 (prefer A0)

**Nash equilibrium under C2: (A0, A0) with payoff of 2 for me**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- Base game (no contract): Expected payoff = 1
- Contract 1: Expected payoff = 2
- Contract 2: Expected payoff = 2

Both contracts achieve the same beneficial outcome (2 points) by making cooperation (A0, A0) the Nash equilibrium. This is strictly better than the base game (1 point).

## Step 5: Decision

Since both contracts:
1. Lead to the same equilibrium payoff (2 points)
2. Are both better than no contract (1 point)
3. Are symmetric and fair

I should approve both contracts to maximize the probability that some beneficial contract is implemented.

response:
To maximize points in the given game, we must first analyze the original payoff structure and how the proposed contract modifies it.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The original game is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

In this scenario, for either player, choosing **A1** is the dominant strategy. Regardless of the other player's choice, A1 yields a higher individual payoff (3 vs. 2 or 1 vs. 0). Consequently, both players would play A1, resulting in a Nash Equilibrium of **(1, 1)**.

### 2. Analysis of the Contract
The proposed contract modifies the payoffs by transferring points based on the actions chosen:
- If a player chooses **A0**, they receive **+2 points** from the other player.
- If a player chooses **A1**, there are no additional payments.

Let's calculate the new payoffs if the contract is signed by both players:
- **(A0, A0):** Both choose A0. Each receives 2 points from the other and gives 2 points to the other. Net payoff: $2 + 2 - 2 = 2$.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 (P1) chooses A0, Player 2 (P2) chooses A1. P1 receives 2 points from P2. 
  - P1: $0 + 2 = 2$ 
  - P2: $3 - 2 = 1$
- **(A1, A0):** P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0. P2 receives 2 points from P1. 
  - P1: $3 - 2 = 1$
  - P2: $0 + 2 = 2$
- **(A1, A1):** No payments. 
  - P1: 1
  - P2: 1

### 3. Evaluation of the New Game
With the contract signed, the payoff matrix becomes:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (2, 1)
- (A1, A0): (1, 2)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

In this modified game, **A0** becomes the dominant strategy for both players. If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 2 points for A0 and 1 for A1. If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 2 points for A0 and 1 for A1. Both players will choose A0, resulting in a Nash Equilibrium of **(2, 2)**.

### 4. Conclusion
If the contract is not signed, the result is (1, 1). If the contract is signed by both, the result is (2, 2). Since a payoff of 2 is superior to 1, and signing the contract aligns the players' incentives toward the mutually beneficial outcome (A0, A0), it is in Player 2's best interest to sign it.

## Step 1: Understand the base game

The base game is a Prisoner's Dilemma:
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)  
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

A1 is a dominant strategy for both players (always better regardless of opponent's choice), leading to Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) with payoff (1, 1) for each player.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (penalty for A1)

Modified payoffs when A1 costs 2 points (paid to other player):
- (A0, A0): (2, 2) - no change
- (A0, A1): (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1) - I receive penalty from other
- (A1, A0): (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2) - I pay penalty to other
- (A1, A1): (1-2+2, 1-2+2) = (1, 1) - we each pay and receive 2

Now checking best responses:
- If other plays A0: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → prefer A0

**A0 becomes the dominant strategy! Nash equilibrium: (A0, A0) with payoff (2, 2)**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (reward for A0)

Modified payoffs when A0 earns 2 points (from other player):
- (A0, A0): (2+2-2, 2+2-2) = (2, 2) - I receive 2, I pay 2
- (A0, A1): (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1) - I receive 2 from other
- (A1, A0): (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2) - I pay 2 to other
- (A1, A1): (1, 1) - no change

Checking best responses:
- If other plays A0: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → prefer A0

**A0 becomes the dominant strategy! Nash equilibrium: (A0, A0) with payoff (2, 2)**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **No contract**: Nash equilibrium gives me 1 point
- **Contract 1**: Nash equilibrium gives me 2 points
- **Contract 2**: Nash equilibrium gives me 2 points

Both contracts are equally beneficial to me and achieve the cooperative outcome (2, 2). They're functionally equivalent despite different mechanisms - one penalizes defection (A1), the other rewards cooperation (A0).

## Step 5: Decision

Since both contracts:
1. Improve my payoff from 1 to 2
2. Lead to identical equilibrium outcomes
3. Are symmetric (benefit both players equally)

I should approve both to maximize the chance that at least one is implemented.

To tackle this problem, we need to analyze the payoff matrix and the probabilities to derive the optimal distribution over the actions A0 and A1.

**Payoff Matrix:**
- If you (Player 1) choose A0 and Player 2 chooses A0: You get 2 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
- If you choose A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: You get 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: You get 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If you choose A1 and Player 2 chooses A1: You get 1 point, Player 2 gets 1 point.

Given that the additional contract-based payment modifications are not in effect (because Player 1, i.e., you, rejected it), we focus solely on the original game described by the payoff matrix.

### Analysis:

Let's identify pure strategies and mixed strategies for both players.

**Pure Strategies:**
1. **Player 1:**
   - Always play A0.
   - Always play A1.
2. **Player 2:**
   - Always play A0.
   - Always play A1.

**Mixed Strategies:**
- Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability \(p\) and A1 with probability \(1 - p\).
- Similarly, Player 2 plays A0 with probability \(q\) and A1 with probability \(1 - q\).

The expected payoff for Player 1 can be calculated as follows:
\[
E[\text{Payoff}] = p \cdot q \cdot 2 + p \cdot (1 - q) \cdot 0 + (1 - p) \cdot q \cdot 3 + (1 - p) \cdot (1 - q) \cdot 1
\]
\[
E[\text{Payoff}] = 2pq + 3(1 - p)q + 1(1 - p)(1 - q)
\]
\[
E[\text{Payoff}] = 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq
\]
\[
E[\text{Payoff}] = q + 2q + 1 - p - q
\]
\[
E[\text{Payoff}] = 2q + 1 - p
\]

Since Player 1 wants to maximize this expression, let's simplify the scenario by examining the best responses based on Player 2's probabilistic choices.

### Simplification of Strategy:
A Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies occurs when each player's strategy is optimal given the other player's strategy. We want to find a mixed strategy where Player 1 and Player 2 have no incentive to unilaterally deviate.

### Symmetric Solution for Equilibrium:
To find an equilibrium, let's assume Player 2 is rational and might play a mixed strategy.

For simplification, let's start by considering that Player 2 uses a mixed strategy where the payoff balance is set. If Player 2 adopts a random mix, Player 1 needs to adjust probabilities to maximize the payoff.

Considering tractable solutions:
- If Player 2 uses an equal mix (50% A0, 50% A1), the analysis will help set intuitive probabilities based upon expected returns.

Let's set Player 2’s mix probability \(q = 0.5\).

\[
E[\text{Payoff}] = 2(0.5) + 1 - p
\]
\[
E[\text{Payoff}] = 1 + 1 - p = 2 - p
\]
To maximize the payoff, minimize \(p\). Surprisingly, pure A0 might maximize Player 1!

Alternatively, we choose to proportionally mix strategies around equilibrium:
Thus:
```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

### Final JSON Answer:
```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine the optimal probabilities for each action, we need to consider the given game's matrix and the adjustments made by the contract. A key consideration is that each decision can significantly affect the total points received due to both the game's base payoffs and the additional points specified in the contract.

Let’s break down the payoff matrix and then incorporate the effects of the contract.

### Basic Game Payoff Matrix
1. (A0, A0) -> You: 2 points, Other: 2 points
2. (A0, A1) -> You: 0 points, Other: 3 points
3. (A1, A0) -> You: 3 points, Other: 0 points
4. (A1, A1) -> You: 1 point, Other: 1 point

### Contract Adjustments
- Choosing A0 gives an additional +2 points to the player choosing A0, and -2 points to the other player.
  
### Adjusted Payoff Matrix considering the contract:
1. (A0, A0) -> You: 2 + 2 = 4 points, Other: 2 + 2 = 4 points
2. (A0, A1) -> You: 0 + 2 = 2 points, Other: 3 - 2 = 1 points
3. (A1, A0) -> You: 3 - 2 = 1 point, Other: 0 + 2 = 2 points
4. (A1, A1) -> You: 1 point, Other: 1 point

### The New Payoff Matrix:
|           | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| You: A0   | (4, 4)     | (2, 1)    |
| You: A1   | (1, 2)     | (1, 1)    |

### Expected Payoff Analysis:

To maximize the total points you would receive, it’s important to consider the expected value for each of your choices given the probabilities of the other player's choices. Let's compute that based on probabilities.

Let:
- \( P(A0) \) be the probability you choose A0.
- \( P(A1) \) be the probability you choose A1.
- \( Q(A0) \) be the probability the other player chooses A0.
- \( Q(A1) \) be the probability the other player chooses A1.

You need to estimate what the other player might likely do (Q). Historically in these types of payoff scenarios, players tend toward Nash Equilibrium strategies.

#### Nash Equilibrium:
Here, the expected value matrices become:
1. For choosing A0:
\[ EU(A0) = 4Q(A0) + 2Q(A1) \]

2. For choosing A1:
\[ EU(A1) = 1Q(A0) + 1Q(A1) \]

For equilibrium, neither player benefits unilaterally by deviating; hence:
\[ EU(A0) = EU(A1) \]
\[ 4Q(A0) + 2Q(A1) = Q(A0) + Q(A1) \]
\[ 3Q(A0) = -Q(A1) \]
Given \( Q(A0) + Q(A1) = 1 \):
\[ 3Q(A0) = (1 - Q(A0)) \]
\[ 3Q(A0) = 1 - Q(A0) \]
\[ 4Q(A0) = 1 \]
\[ Q(A0) = 1/4 = 0.25 \]
\[ Q(A1) = 0.75 \]

At this equilibrium condition, you get higher guaranteed points for any single game.

### Optimal Strategy:
Given others' strategies:
- Highest EV rewards occurs by mixing strategy due to tit-for-tat or optimal responses. Due to equilibrium:

Choose a similar balance respecting others.
\[ PA0\_you = Q(A0) = 25 \]
\[ PA1\_you = Q(A1) = 75 \]

Thus the JSON configuration is:
```json
{"A0": 25, "A1": 75}
```

This mix points increases most game in longer run by contract-bound.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs

Without the contract:
- Both A0: I get 2
- I play A0, other plays A1: I get 0
- I play A1, other plays A0: I get 3
- Both A1: I get 1

This is a prisoner's dilemma where A1 dominates A0 for each player:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A1 (3 > 2)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A1 (1 > 0)

**Nash equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → I get 1 point**

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds: If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- Both A0: I get 2 (no change)
- I play A0, other plays A1: I get 0 + 2 = **2** (I receive their payment)
- I play A1, other plays A0: I get 3 - 2 = **1** (I pay them)
- Both A1: I get 1 - 2 + 2 = **1** (we pay each other, net zero)

## Step 3: Analyze the new incentives

With the contract:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (2 > 1)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (2 > 1)

Now A0 strictly dominates A1!

**Nash equilibrium with contract: (A0, A0) → I get 2 points**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- Without contract: equilibrium payoff = 1 point
- With contract: equilibrium payoff = 2 points

The contract transforms the prisoner's dilemma into a coordination game where mutual cooperation (A0, A0) becomes the Nash equilibrium.

## Step 5: Decision

Since the other player faces the same incentive structure, they should also sign. Signing benefits both of us, and if the contract isn't signed by all, we simply revert to the original game (no downside to signing).

response:
Let's break down the situation and analyze our strategy step by step.

### Basic Payoff Matrix (without considering the contract)
Here is a simple representation of the payoff matrix for Player 1 (You):

|         | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** |   2, 2  |   0, 3  |
| **P1: A1** |   3, 0  |   1, 1  |

### Contract Effect
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player's points.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

### Adjusted Payoff Matrix (considering the contract)
Let's adjust the payoff matrix to incorporate these contract rules:

|         | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (2+2)-1, 2-2+1  | (0+2)-1, 3-2+1   |
| **P1: A1** | (3+0)-0, 0-0+0  | (1+0)-0, 1-0+0   |

This simplifies to:
|         | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** |   3, 1  |   1, 2  |
| **P1: A1** |   3, 0  |   1, 1  |

### Expected Payoffs
To determine the best strategy, we need to analyze the expected payoff for different scenarios.

1. **If you choose A0**:
   - If Player 2 chooses A0: You get 3 points.
   - If Player 2 chooses A1: You get 1 point.

2. **If you choose A1**:
   - If Player 2 chooses A0: You get 3 points.
   - If Player 2 chooses A1: You get 1 point.

### Conclusion:

Given the adjusted payoffs, we can deduce the following:

- If **Player 2** is more likely to choose **A0**, you should choose **A0** to gain additional points.
- If **Player 2** is more likely to choose **A1**, you should choose **A1** to gain points. 

However, if Player 2 is rational and aims to maximize their points, they might be inclined to cooperate (choosing A0) or defect opportunistically (choosing A1 hoping you’ll choose A0). 

Given no specific tendencies or patterns from Player 2, and considering that both A0 and A1 give a potential equal maximum payoff of 3 under different conditions, a balanced strategy might involve randomization.

### Final Mixed Strategy:
To avoid predictability and ensure the possibility of maximizing points regardless of Player 2's moves, you can mix strategies.

Let's consider a balanced approach with a slight inclination to cooperation (choosing A0 more frequently due to its added contract benefit).

A reasonable mixed strategy could be:
- Choosing A0: 60%
- Choosing A1: 40%

This mixed strategy considers the possibility of drawing benefits from the additional contract rule while not being overly predictable.

### JSON Output:
```json
{"A0": 60, "A1": 40}
```

This results in the following final answer:
```json
{"A0": 60, "A1": 40}

response:
To maximize my total points in this game, I need to analyze both the basic game and the implications of the proposed contract.

1.  **Analyze the Basic Game:**
    The original payoffs are:
    - (A0, A0): (2, 2)
    - (A0, A1): (0, 3)
    - (A1, A0): (3, 0)
    - (A1, A1): (1, 1)
    This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma. For both players, action A1 is the dominant strategy because it yields a higher payoff regardless of what the other player chooses (3 > 2 and 1 > 0). Consequently, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), where each player receives **1 point**.

2.  **Analyze the Contract:**
    The contract specifies that any player who chooses action A0 receives 2 points from the other player.
    Let's calculate the effective payoffs if the contract is signed (assuming P1 and P2 are the players):
    - **If (A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives 2 points from the other. The net change is zero. Effective payoff: (2, 2).
    - **If (A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 and receives 2 points from Player 2. Effective payoff: P1 = 0 + 2 = 2, P2 = 3 - 2 = 1.
    - **If (A1, A0):** Player 2 chooses A0 and receives 2 points from Player 1. Effective payoff: P1 = 3 - 2 = 1, P2 = 0 + 2 = 2.
    - **If (A1, A1):** Neither player chooses A0. No payments are made. Effective payoff: (1, 1).

3.  **Analyze Strategy with the Contract:**
    With the contract active, the new payoff matrix is:
    - (A0, A0): (2, 2)
    - (A0, A1): (2, 1)
    - (A1, A0): (1, 2)
    - (A1, A1): (1, 1)
    Now, action A0 is the dominant strategy for both players. If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets 2 points for A0 and 1 for A1. If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets 2 points for A0 and 1 for A1. In both scenarios, A0 is superior. The new Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), where each player receives **2 points**.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    The contract successfully transforms a Prisoner's Dilemma into a game where cooperation (A0) is the dominant strategy. Since the Equilibrium payoff with the contract (2 points) is higher than the Equilibrium payoff without the contract (1 point), and there is no risk to signing (the contract only activates if all players agree), it is in my best interest to sign it.

Let me analyze this step by step.

## Step 1: Understanding the base game payoffs

The payoff matrix without any contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 2, other gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 1, other gets 1

In this base game, A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A1 (3 points) over A0 (2 points)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A1 (1 point) over A0 (0 points)

**Equilibrium without contract: Both play A1 → I get 1 point**

## Step 2: Understanding the contract

The contract adds:
- If a player chooses A0: they get +2 points (paid by the other player)
- If a player chooses A1: no additional payments

## Step 3: Calculating payoffs WITH the contract

Modified payoff matrix:
- (A0, A0): I get 2+2-2 = **2**, other gets 2+2-2 = 2
  - (We both receive +2 for choosing A0, but both pay -2 to the other)
- (A0, A1): I get 0+2 = **2**, other gets 3-2 = 1
  - (I receive +2, they pay -2)
- (A1, A0): I get 3-2 = **1**, other gets 0+2 = 2
  - (I pay -2, they receive +2)
- (A1, A1): I get **1**, other gets 1
  - (No contract payments)

With the contract, A0 now strictly dominates A1:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (2 points) over A1 (1 point)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (2 points) over A1 (1 point)

**Equilibrium with contract: Both play A0 → I get 2 points**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: Equilibrium payoff = 1 point
- **With contract**: Equilibrium payoff = 2 points

The contract transforms the game from a prisoner's dilemma (where we both defect to A1) into a coordination game where mutual cooperation (A0, A0) becomes the dominant strategy equilibrium. This increases my payoff from 1 to 2.

**Conclusion: I should sign the contract.**

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
First incorporate the contract into *your* (Player 2) payoff:

- If **you** play **A1**, you **pay 2** to Player 1 ⇒ your payoff **−2**.
- If **Player 1** plays **A1**, they **pay 2** to you ⇒ your payoff **+2**.

Compute your contract-adjusted payoffs (Player 1 action shown first):

1) (P1 A0, P2 A0): original 2, no payments ⇒ **2**  
2) (P1 A1, P2 A0): original 0, P1 pays you 2 ⇒ **2**  
3) (P1 A0, P2 A1): original 3, you pay 2 ⇒ **1**  
4) (P1 A1, P2 A1): original 1, you pay 2 and receive 2 ⇒ **1**

So:
- If P1 plays **A0**: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 1 ⇒ prefer **A0**
- If P1 plays **A1**: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 1 ⇒ prefer **A0**

Thus **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you. Play A0 with probability 1.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

The original payoff matrix is:
```
                Other: A0   Other: A1
Me (P1): A0       2,2         0,3
Me (P1): A1       3,0         1,1
```

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma. A1 is the dominant strategy for both players (always better regardless of what the other does), leading to Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) = (1, 1). However, mutual cooperation (A0, A0) = (2, 2) would be better for both.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (my proposal)

Contract 1: Playing A1 costs 2 points paid to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 2, 2 (no change)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 (receive their penalty) = **2** for me, 3 - 2 = **1** for them
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 (pay penalty) = **1** for me, 0 + 2 (receive my penalty) = **2** for them
- (A1, A1): 1 - 2 + 2 = **1** for me, 1 - 2 + 2 = **1** for them

New matrix with C1:
```
                Other: A0   Other: A1
Me (P1): A0       2,2         2,1
Me (P1): A1       1,2         1,1
```

**A0 now dominates A1!** Nash equilibrium becomes (A0, A0) = (2, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (their proposal)

Contract 2: Playing A0 receives 1 point from other player; playing A1 pays 1 point to other player.

Net transfers to me:
- My A0: +1 from them
- My A1: -1 to them  
- Their A0: -1 to them
- Their A1: +1 from them

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 2 + 1 - 1 = **2** for me
- (A0, A1): 0 + 1 + 1 = **2** for me
- (A1, A0): 3 - 1 - 1 = **1** for me
- (A1, A1): 1 - 1 + 1 = **1** for me

New matrix with C2:
```
                Other: A0   Other: A1
Me (P1): A0       2,2         2,1
Me (P1): A1       1,2         1,1
```

**Same result!** A0 dominates A1, Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) = (2, 2).

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts:
- Transform the game so A0 becomes the dominant strategy
- Lead to the cooperative outcome (2, 2) instead of (1, 1)
- Are symmetric and fair
- Maximize my expected payoff at 2 points

Both contracts are equally beneficial to me. I should approve both to ensure a beneficial contract is implemented.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### 1. **Understanding the Basic Game Payoffs:**
- **If both choose A0:** Both get 2 points.
- **If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1:** P1 gets 3 points, P2 gets 0 points.
- **If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0:** P1 gets 0 points, P2 gets 3 points.
- **If both choose A1:** Both get 1 point.

#### 2. **Understanding the Contract Payoffs:**
- **If a player chooses A0:** They receive an additional 1 point from the other player.
- **If a player chooses A1:** They pay an additional 1 point to the other player.

#### 3. **Impact of the Contract on Payoffs:**
- **If both choose A0:** Original: both get 2 points.
  - Contract effect: both get an extra point from the other, so net effect = both get 3 points.
- **If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1:** Original: P1 gets 3 points, P2 gets 0 points.
  - Contract effect: P1 gets an extra point from P2, and P2 loses a point to P1.
  - Net effect: P1 gets 4 points, P2 gets -1 point.
- **If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0:** Original: P1 gets 0 points, P2 gets 3 points.
  - Contract effect: P2 gets an extra point from P1, and P1 loses a point to P2.
  - Net effect: P1 gets -1 point, P2 gets 4 points.
- **If both choose A1:** Original: both get 1 point.
  - Contract effect: both lose a point to the other, so net effect = both get 0 points.

#### 4. **Analysis for Player 2's Decision:**
Without contract:
- P2's expected payoff if both choose uniformly randomly:
  - E(A0) = (0.5 * (2 + 0)) + (0.5 * (3 + 1)) = 1 + 2 = 3.0
  - E(A1) = (0.5 * (1 + 3)) + (0.5 * (1 + 1)) = 2 + 1 = 3.0

With contract:
- P2's expected payoff if both choose uniformly randomly:
  - E(A0) = (0.5 * (3 + 0)) + (0.5 * (4 + -1)) = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0
  - E(A1) = (0.5 * (0 + 4)) + (0.5 * (0 + 0)) = 2 + 0 = 2.0

We can see that choosing A1 results in a lower payoff for Player 2 if the contract is signed (2.0 with vs. 3.0 without). However, if both players are rational and aim to maximize their points, they would favor choosing A0 under the contract.

#### Game Theoretical Calculation:
- Let's calculate the Hybrid Nash Equilibrium to verify:
  - If assuming P1 knew P2's strategy, and vice versa:
    - **Pure strategies under contract**:
      - Cooperation: A0-A0: both get 3
      - Defection and betrayal P1 - P2: A0-A1 - P1 gets 4, P2 gets -1

Thus, given that signing the contract incentivizes both players to choose A0, which maximizes the total point for both (i.e., cooperation gives higher and steady payoffs), Player 2 should sign the contract as it would push Player 1 towards cooperative behavior.

### Final JSON Output
```json
{
  "sign": true
}
```

This conclusion is derived by considering that maximizing the consistent higher payoff through cooperation is more advantageous for both players.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

The base payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 2, other gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 1, other gets 1

If the other player plays A0: I get 2 from A0, or 3 from A1 → A1 is better
If the other player plays A1: I get 0 from A0, or 1 from A1 → A1 is better

A1 is a dominant strategy for both players. The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with both players getting **1 point**.

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- Playing A0: receive +2 points from the other player
- Playing A1: no additional payments

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 2 + 2 - 2 = **2**, other gets 2 + 2 - 2 = 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 2 - 0 = **2**, other gets 3 + 0 - 2 = 1
- (A1, A0): I get 3 + 0 - 2 = **1**, other gets 0 + 2 - 0 = 2
- (A1, A1): I get 1 + 0 - 0 = **1**, other gets 1 + 0 - 0 = 1

If the other player plays A0: I get 2 from A0, or 1 from A1 → A0 is better
If the other player plays A1: I get 2 from A0, or 1 from A1 → A0 is better

With the contract, A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both players. The Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) with both players getting **2 points**.

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- Without contract: Expected payoff = 1 point
- With contract: Expected payoff = 2 points

The contract transforms the prisoner's dilemma into a coordination game where mutual cooperation (A0, A0) is the dominant strategy equilibrium. This is strictly better for me (and for both players).

## Conclusion

I should sign the contract because it increases my expected payoff from 1 to 2 points.

## Step-by-step Analysis

### Step 1: Understanding the Original Game

The original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (3, 0)  
- (A1, A0): (0, 3)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)

This is a **prisoner's dilemma**. For me (Player 2):
- If Player 1 plays A0: I get 2 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → A1 is better
- If Player 1 plays A1: I get 0 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → A1 is better

**A1 is my dominant strategy**, leading to Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) = **(1, 1) payoff**.

### Step 2: Calculate Modified Payoffs with Contract

Contract terms:
- Choosing A0: receive +1 from other player
- Choosing A1: pay -1 to other player

Modified payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

**(A0, A0)**: 
- Both receive +1, both pay -1 → net 0
- Result: (2, 2)

**(A0, A1)** [P1 plays A0, I play A1]:
- P1: 3 + 1 (receives for A0) + 1 (receives from my A1) = **5**
- Me: 0 - 1 (pays for A1) - 1 (pays for P1's A0) = **-2**
- Result: (5, -2)

**(A1, A0)** [P1 plays A1, I play A0]:
- P1: 0 - 1 (pays for A1) - 1 (pays for my A0) = **-2**
- Me: 3 + 1 (receives for A0) + 1 (receives from P1's A1) = **5**
- Result: (-2, 5)

**(A1, A1)**:
- Both pay -1, both receive +1 → net 0
- Result: (1, 1)

### Step 3: Analyze Modified Game

Modified matrix:
```
           Me (P2)
           A0    A1
P1    A0   2,2   5,-2
      A1  -2,5   1,1
```

For me (Player 2):
- If P1 plays A0: I get **2** from A0 vs **-2** from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If P1 plays A1: I get **5** from A0 vs **1** from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 is now my dominant strategy!**

The new Nash equilibrium is **(A0, A0) with payoff (2, 2)**.

### Step 4: Compare Outcomes

- **Without contract**: I get **1 point** (from A1, A1 equilibrium)
- **With contract**: I get **2 points** (from A0, A0 equilibrium)

The contract transforms the prisoner's dilemma into a game where cooperation (A0) is the dominant strategy, improving my expected payoff from 1 to 2 points.

### Conclusion

I should sign the contract because it increases my equilibrium payoff from 1 to 2 points.

response:
To analyze this game, we need to consider several factors: the payoffs from the actions and the additional points allocated by the contract for choosing A0 or A1. Our goal is to maximize our total points.

### Basic Payoff Analysis
Let's first re-examine the basic payoffs for each combination of actions:
- If both players choose A0, each gets 2 points.
- If we choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, we get 0 points.
- If we choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, we get 3 points.
- If both players choose A1, each gets 1 point.

### Contract Impact Analysis
Given the contract:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 1 point drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 1 point distributed equally to the other player.

When factoring in the contract, the new payoffs are:
- If both players choose A0, each gets \(2 + 1 = 3\) points.
- If we choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, we get \(0 + 1 = 1\) points, while the other player gets \(3 - 1 = 2\) points.
- If we choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, we get \(3 - 1 = 2\) points, while the other player gets \(0 + 1 = 1\) points.
- If both players choose A1, each gets \(1 - 1 = 0\) points.

### Optimizing the Strategy
To determine the optimal strategy, we need to consider the potential mixed strategies and their expected values:

#### Expected Value Calculations
Let:
- \( p \) be the probability of choosing A0 for us.
- \( q \) be the probability of choosing A0 for the other player.

The expected value \( E \) for us choosing A0 is:
\[ E(A0) = 3q + 1(1 - q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1 \]

The expected value \( E \) for us choosing A1 is:
\[ E(A1) = 2(1 - q) + 0q = 2 - 2q \]

We need to compare:
- \( 2q + 1 \) (for choosing A0)
- \( 2 - 2q \) (for choosing A1)

Set these equal to find the equilibrium point:
\[ 2q + 1 = 2 - 2q \]
\[ 4q = 1 \]
\[ q = 0.25 \]

Therefore, if the other player plays A0 with probability 25% and A1 with probability 75%, both strategies are equal for us.

### Balanced Strategy
Since we aim to be unpredictable to prevent being exploited, we shall use the same strategy in equilibrium.

#### Final Distribution
Thus, based on our rational mixed strategy:
- Probability of A0: 25%
- Probability of A1: 75%

Thus, the final JSON object with the strategy is:

```json
{"A0": 25, "A1": 75}
```

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Understanding the Modified Payoffs

Let me first calculate the actual payoffs after applying the contract terms.

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0: they get +2 points, and the other player pays -2 points
- If a player chooses A1: no additional payments

## Step 2: Computing All Four Outcomes

**Outcome 1: Both choose A0**
- Base payoffs: I get 2, Other gets 2
- I chose A0: I get +2, Other pays -2
- Other chose A0: Other gets +2, I pay -2
- **Final: I get 2, Other gets 2**

**Outcome 2: I choose A0, Other chooses A1**
- Base payoffs: I get 0, Other gets 3
- I chose A0: I get +2, Other pays -2
- **Final: I get 2, Other gets 1**

**Outcome 3: I choose A1, Other chooses A0**
- Base payoffs: I get 3, Other gets 0
- Other chose A0: Other gets +2, I pay -2
- **Final: I get 1, Other gets 2**

**Outcome 4: Both choose A1**
- Base payoffs: I get 1, Other gets 1
- No contract payments
- **Final: I get 1, Other gets 1**

## Step 3: Analyzing My Payoff Matrix

|          | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0| 2              | 2              |
| I play A1| 1              | 1              |

## Step 4: Finding Optimal Strategy

Comparing my payoffs:
- If Other plays A0: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If Other plays A1: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1!** No matter what the other player does, I always get a higher payoff by choosing A0.

## Step 5: Conclusion

Since A0 gives me a payoff of 2 in all scenarios while A1 only gives me 1, the optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Original Game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):

|          | P1 plays A0 | P1 plays A1 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| I play A0| I get: 2    | I get: 0    |
| I play A1| I get: 3    | I get: 1    |

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma:
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (3 > 2)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (1 > 0)
- A1 is my dominant strategy, and similarly for P1

**Nash Equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → Both get 1 point**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (Proposed by Player 1)

Contract effect: Playing A1 costs 2 points, paid to the other player.

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 2 (no change)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 (P1 pays me) = **2**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 (I pay P1) = **1**
- (A1, A1): 1 - 2 (I pay) + 2 (P1 pays me) = **1**

New payoff matrix:
|          | P1 plays A0 | P1 plays A1 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| I play A0| 2           | 2           |
| I play A1| 1           | 1           |

Now A0 dominates A1 for me! Similarly for P1.

**New equilibrium: (A0, A0) → Both get 2 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (Proposed by Player 2)

This is identical to Contract 1 - same penalty structure.

**Same result: (A0, A0) → Both get 2 points**

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts:
- Transform the game from Prisoner's Dilemma to one where cooperation (A0) is dominant
- Increase my expected payoff from 1 to 2
- Are strictly beneficial to me

I should approve both contracts.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game without contracts

The payoff matrix shows a classic Prisoner's Dilemma:
- If opponent plays A0: I get 2 from A0, or 3 from A1 → **A1 better**
- If opponent plays A1: I get 0 from A0, or 1 from A1 → **A1 better**

A1 is my dominant strategy. By symmetry, A1 is also the opponent's dominant strategy.

**Nash equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → I get 1 point**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1 adds a penalty: choosing A1 costs 2 points paid to the other player.

New payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): I get 2, opponent gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 2 (payment from opponent) = **2**, opponent gets 3 - 2 = 1
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 2 = **1**, opponent gets 0 + 2 = 2  
- (A1, A1): I get 1 - 2 + 2 = **1**, opponent gets 1 - 2 + 2 = 1

Now checking dominant strategies:
- If opponent plays A0: I get 2 from A0, or 1 from A1 → **A0 better**
- If opponent plays A1: I get 2 from A0, or 1 from A1 → **A0 better**

**Nash equilibrium with Contract 1: (A0, A0) → I get 2 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2 is identical to Contract 1 (same penalty structure).

**Nash equilibrium with Contract 2: (A0, A0) → I get 2 points**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- Without any contract: 1 point
- With Contract 1: 2 points  
- With Contract 2: 2 points

Both contracts transform the game so that mutual cooperation (A0, A0) becomes the Nash equilibrium, increasing my payoff from 1 to 2 points.

## Step 5: Decision

Since both contracts are identical and both strictly improve my expected payoff, I should approve both to maximize the chance that one gets implemented.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, let's analyze the game by incorporating the payment contract into the basic payoff matrix.

### 1. Identify Basic Payoffs
The payoffs for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2, "you") are:
- (P1: A0, P2: A0) = (2, 2)
- (P1: A1, P2: A0) = (0, 3) (from P2's perspective: "you choose A0, other chooses A1")
- (P1: A0, P2: A1) = (3, 0) (from P2's perspective: "you choose A1, other chooses A0")
- (P1: A1, P2: A1) = (1, 1)

### 2. Apply the Payment Contract
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +2 points, and the other player loses 2 points.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

Recalculating the payoffs with the contract:
- **(P1: A0, P2: A0):**
  - P1: 2 + 2 (own A0) - 2 (P2's A0) = 2
  - P2: 2 + 2 (own A0) - 2 (P1's A0) = 2
  - **Result: (2, 2)**
- **(P1: A1, P2: A0):**
  - P1: 0 + 0 (own A1) - 2 (P2's A0) = -2 (correction: let's re-read basic payoffs)
  Wait, basic (P1: A1, P2: A0) is P1=0, P2=3.
  - P1: 0 + 0 (own A1) - 2 (P2's A0) = -2
  - P2: 3 + 2 (own A0) - 0 (P1's A1) = 5
  - **Result: (-2, 5)** (wait, checking the payoff table again...)
  Actually, let's re-read carefully: "If you(P2) choose A0 and the other player(P1) chooses A1: you get 0, the other player gets 3."
  Basic: P2:A0, P1:A1: P2=0, P1=3.
  P2: 0 + 2 (own A0) - 0 (P1's A1) = 2.
  P1: 3 + 0 (own A1) - 2 (P2's A0) = 1.
  - **Revised Result (P1: A1, P2: A0): (1, 2)**
- **(P1: A0, P2: A1):**
  Basic: P2:A1, P1:A0: P2=3, P1=0.
  P1: 0 + 2 (own A0) - 0 (P2's A1) = 2.
  P2: 3 + 0 (own A1) - 2 (P1's A0) = 1.
  - **Revised Result (P1: A0, P2: A1): (2, 1)**
- **(P1: A1, P2: A1):**
  - **Result: (1, 1)** (No changes)

### 3. Analyze the Strategy
The final payoff matrix for (P1, P2) is:
- **A0, A0:** (2, 2)
- **A0, A1:** (2, 1)
- **A1, A0:** (1, 2)
- **A1, A1:** (1, 1)

**Player 2's Dominant Strategy:**
- If P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 2 from A0, 1 from A1. (A0 is better)
- If P1 chooses A1: P2 gets 2 from A0, 1 from A1. (A0 is better)
Thus, **A0** is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2.

**Player 1's Dominant Strategy:**
- If P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 2 from A0, 1 from A1. (A0 is better)
- If P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 2 from A0, 1 from A1. (A0 is better)
Thus, **A0** is also a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1.

### 4. Conclusion
Both players reaching the Nash Equilibrium of choosing A0 results in 2 points each, which is the highest achievable consistent payoff given the contract.

3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoffs with the contract

The base game payoffs for me are:
- (A0, A0): 2 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points  
- (A1, A0): 3 points
- (A1, A1): 1 point

Now applying the contract (if I choose A1, I pay 2 points to the other player; if they choose A1, I receive 2 points):

**Modified payoffs for me:**
- (A0, A0): 2 + 0 - 0 = **2 points**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 - 0 = **2 points** (I receive 2 from their A1 penalty)
- (A1, A0): 3 + 0 - 2 = **1 point** (I pay 2 for choosing A1)
- (A1, A1): 1 + 2 - 2 = **1 point** (I pay 2 but receive 2)

## Step 2: Analyze my options

If I play **A0**: I get 2 points regardless of what the other player does
If I play **A1**: I get 1 point regardless of what the other player does

## Step 3: Identify the dominant strategy

A0 strictly dominates A1! 
- Playing A0 always gives me 2 points
- Playing A1 always gives me 1 point
- Therefore, A0 is always better

## Step 4: Verify this is optimal

My expected payoff with probability p for A0:
- E[payoff] = p × 2 + (1-p) × 1 = p + 1

This is maximized when p = 1 (always play A0).

## Conclusion

The contract successfully transforms the original prisoner's dilemma by penalizing defection (A1), making cooperation (A0) the dominant strategy. I should always choose A0.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Let's break down this decision-making game step by step, considering:

1. **The original game** (without contracts),
2. **The role of the player**: You are **Player 2**,
3. **The contract proposal mechanism** and **approval voting**,
4. **The effect of each contract** on the expected payoffs,
5. **Your strategic interest** in approving or rejecting each contract.

---

### **Step 1: Analyze the original game (no contract)**

The payoff matrix (from **Player 2's perspective**, since you are Player 2):

|          | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **You: A0** | 2            | 0            |
| **You: A1** | 3            | 1            |

So, your payoffs are:

- If you play A0:  
  - vs A0 → 2  
  - vs A1 → 0  
- If you play A1:  
  - vs A0 → 3  
  - vs A1 → 1

Now, let’s find the **Nash equilibrium** of this game.

---

#### **Best responses:**

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p).

Your expected payoff:

- E(A0) = p×2 + (1−p)×0 = 2p
- E(A1) = p×3 + (1−p)×1 = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1

Compare:
- E(A1) − E(A0) = (2p + 1) − 2p = 1 > 0 ⇒ A1 always gives you **more than A0**, **regardless of p**.

So, **A1 strictly dominates A0** for you, the Player 2.

Wait — let’s verify:  
- If p = 0 (Player 1 plays A1 always):  
  - A0 gives 0, A1 gives 1 → A1 better  
- If p = 1 (Player 1 plays A0 always):  
  - A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 → A1 better  
- If p = 0.5:  
  - A0: 2×0.5 = 1  
  - A1: 2×0.5 + 1 = 2 → still better

So **A1 is strictly dominant** for Player 2.

Now, what about Player 1?

Player 1’s payoffs (from their own view):
|          | You (P2): A0 | You (P2): A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0** | 2            | 3            |
| **P1: A1** | 0            | 1            |

For Player 1:
- If you (P2) play A0: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → A0 better
- If you (P2) play A1: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → A0 better

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1.

Thus, the unique **Nash equilibrium** is:
- P1 plays A0 (with probability 1),
- P2 plays A1 (with probability 1)

**Outcome**: You choose A1, Player 1 chooses A0 → you get **3 points**, Player 1 gets **0 points**.

So in the baseline game, you get **3 points** by playing A1. And since A1 dominates, you will always play A1 if uncontracted.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract mechanism**

Contracts are **only applied if both players approve them** (via approval voting), and the **winning contract is chosen uniformly at random among those with the maximum approvals**.

Each contract modifies the base payoff by adding or subtracting points based on your action, and these are **distributed among players**.

You are Player 2. You are allowed to **approve or reject** each contract.

> **Your goal**: Maximize your **expected total points** across all possible outcomes.

But note: **You don’t get to pick which contract is applied** — only the ones approved will be in the running, and one is chosen at random from the most-approved ones.

So to maximize your chance of a good expected payoff, you want to:
- Approve contracts that **increase your expected payoff**,
- Reject contracts that **decrease your expected payoff**, or
- That are **ambiguous**, but especially if the risk is high.

However, **you don’t control which contract is selected**, only **which ones are eligible**.

So:
- If you approve a contract that benefits you, it increases the chance that a favorable contract is chosen (if no better one comes along).
- If you approve a contract that harms you, it might be selected and harm you — unless there’s a better one.

But since **the winning contract is chosen at random among the most-approved ones**, your strategic move is:
- **Approve only contracts that you believe are better for you** than the baseline (or offer a safer/linear improvement),
- **Reject contracts that hurt you**, even if they might help the other player.

Let’s now analyze each contract.

---

### **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

This is a **symmetric rule**, applied to both players.

Let’s analyze how this changes the **payoff matrix** from **your (Player 2)** view.

#### How does it modify payoffs?

Let’s denote the **base payoff** + **contract adjustment**.

**Case 1: You play A0, Player 1 plays A0**
- Base: you get 2
- You choose A0 → get +1
- Player 1 chooses A0 → gets +1
- So the +1 to you is **drawn from the other player (P1)** → P1 pays you 1
- So net: You get 2 + 1 = **3**
- P1 gets 2 — 1 = **1**

Wait — the contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- When P1 chooses A0 → he pays 1, goes to you (P2)?  
But it says **"drawn from the other players"** — plural? But there is only one other player.

Re-reading: "drawn equally from the other players" → if there is only one other player, then **the full 1 is taken from that player**.

So:
- When **any player chooses A0**, they get +1, **paid by the other player** (since there is only one other).
- When **any player chooses A1**, they pay -1, **paid to the other player** (distributed to other players — again, only one).

So **this contract is symmetric**.

So for any player:
- A0 → **+1**, paid by opponent
- A1 → **−1**, paid to opponent

So for **you (P2)**:

| P1 \ You | A0           | A1          |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| A0       | 2 + 1 = 3    | 3 − 1 = 2   |
| A1       | 0 − 1 = -1   | 1 + 1 = 2   |

Wait: let’s go step by step.

#### Full payoff modification (with contract):

Let’s suppose:
- Both players choose actions: your action and P1’s action.

Then payoffs are:
- Base payoff (from original game) + contract adjustment

**Contract adjustment rules**:
- For **each player**, if they play A0 → +1 → paid by opponent
- If they play A1 → −1 → paid to opponent

So the **net effect on your total payoff** is:
- If you play A0 → +1
- If you play A1 → −1
- If opponent plays A0 → you pay them 1
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 1 from them

So total change to **your payoff**:
= (your action impact) + (opponent’s action impact)

= [1 if you play A0 else -1] + [1 if opponent plays A1 else -1]

So your **total payoff under contract C1** is:

> Base payoff + (if you play A0: +1) + (if you play A1: -1) + (if P1 plays A1: +1) + (if P1 plays A0: -1)

Wait, no: the contract **alters individual payoffs**, not total.

Let’s define:
- Your payoff under C1 = **base payoff** + **adjustment from your choice** + **adjustment from opponent’s choice**

But the adjustment **on your payoff**:
- When YOU choose A0: you get +1 → so +1 added
- When YOU choose A1: you pay 1 → so -1 added
- When OPPONENT chooses A0: you pay 1 → so -1 added
- When OPPONENT chooses A1: you get 1 → so +1 added

So net adjustment for **your payoff**:
→ +1 if you play A0  
→ −1 if you play A1  
→ −1 if opponent plays A0  
→ +1 if opponent plays A1

So total adjustment:
= (1 if you play A0 else -1) + (1 if opponent plays A1 else -1)

Let’s make a table for **your payoff under C1**:

| P1 \ You | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | base 2 + (+1) + (-1) = 2 | base 0 + (-1) + (-1) = -2 |
| A1       | base 3 + (+1) + (+1) = 5 | base 1 + (-1) + (+1) = 1 |

So:

| Your action | Opponent action | Base | Adjusted payoff (C1) |
|-------------|-----------------|------|-----------------------|
| A0          | A0              | 2    | 2 + 1 − 1 = 2         |
| A0          | A1              | 0    | 0 + 1 − 1 = 0         |
| A1          | A0              | 3    | 3 − 1 − 1 = 1         |
| A1          | A1              | 1    | 1 − 1 + 1 = 1         |

Wait — that doesn't make sense. The adjustment depends on both actions.

Let’s recast the adjustment part correctly:

**Adjustment to your payoff**:
- From your own action: +1 if A0, −1 if A1
- From opponent's action: −1 if opponent plays A0 (you pay them), +1 if opponent plays A1 (you get from them)

So:

- (You A0, P1 A0): your adj = +1 (A0) + (−1 for P1 A0) = 0 → total payoff: 2 + 0 = 2
- (You A0, P1 A1): your adj = +1 + (+1) = +2 → 0 + 2 = 2
- (You A1, P1 A0): adj = −1 + (−1) = −2 → 3 − 2 = 1
- (You A1, P1 A1): adj = −1 + (+1) = 0 → 1 + 0 = 1

So adjusted payoffs:

|          | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|----------|-------|-------|
| You A0   | 2     | 2     |
| You A1   | 1     | 1     |

Oh! So **regardless of what you do**, if P1 plays A0, you get 2 if A0, 1 if A1 — but A0 better.

Wait: under C1, **if you play A0**, you always get 2  
If you play A1, you always get 1

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for **you** under C1.

So you will play A0 with 100% probability (you want to maximize your payoff, and A0 gives 2 every time).

But now, what about **Player 1’s incentives**?

Let’s compute Player 1’s payoffs under C1 (from P1’s perspective):

Adjustment for P1:
- If P1 plays A0: +1 (from their choice) → paid by you
- If P1 plays A1: −1 → paid to you
- If you play A0: P1 pays you 1 → so P1 loses 1
- If you play A1: P1 gains 1 → so benefits

So P1’s adjustment:
= (1 if P1 plays A0) + (1 if you play A1) → wait no:
- When P1 plays A0: +1 (from choice)
- When P1 plays A1: −1
- When *you* play A0: P1 pays 1 → −1 to P1
- When *you* play A1: P1 gets 1 → +1 to P1

So P1’s total payoff under C1:

| You \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | 2 (base) + 1 (P1 A0) − 1 (you A0) = 2 | 3 (base) − 1 (P1 A1) − 1 (you A0) = 1 |
| A1       | 0 (base) + 1 (P1 A0) + 1 (you A1) = 2 | 1 (base) − 1 (P1 A1) + 1 (you A1) = 1 |

So P1’s payoff matrix:

| You \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | 2  | 1  |
| A1       | 2  | 1  |

So P1 gets 2 if they play A0, 1 if they play A1 — regardless of your choice.

So **P1 strictly prefers A0**.

Therefore, under C1:
- You (P2) want to play A0 (dominant)
- P1 wants to play A0 (dominant)

So equilibrium: **both play A0**

Your payoff: **2**

But in the **original game**, you got **3** by playing A1.

So **this contract reduces your payoff from 3 to 2**.

Even though you are forced into A0, you get only 2 vs original 3.

So this contract is **bad for you**.

> **C1 makes you worse off**.

Also, note: the contract is **symmetric**, but since you are in a position where you naturally do well by playing A1 (because P1 plays A0), forcing both to play A0 harms you.

Therefore, **you should reject C1**.

But wait: is there a chance that this contract induces better coordination?

Even though the equilibrium is (A0,A0), you get only 2, which is worse than 3.

So **you are worse off under C1**.

So **do not approve C1**.

---

### **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2 (that's you!)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So only A1 triggers a payment.

- If you choose A1 → you pay 1 → goes to other player (P1)
- If you choose A0 → no change
- If P1 chooses A1 → P1 pays 1 → goes to you (P2)

So for **your payoff (Player 2)**:

Adjustment:
- If you play A1 → you pay 1 → −1
- If you play A0 → 0
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 1 → +1

So your **net adjustment** depends on both actions.

Now, let’s compute your updated payoffs:

| P1 \ You | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | 2 + 0 (no adj) + 0 (P1 A0) = 2 | 0 + (−1 for you A1) + 0 = −1 |
| A1       | 3 + 0 + 1 (P1 A1) = 4 | 1 + (−1) + 1 = 1 |

So adjusted payoffs:

| You \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | 2  | 4  |
| A1       | −1 | 1  |

Now, let’s find best responses.

For you:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 2, A1 gives −1 → best: A0
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 4, A1 gives 1 → best: A0

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you.

So you will play A0.

Now what about P1?

Payoffs for P1 under C2:

- If P1 plays A0: no payment → 0
- If P1 plays A1: pays 1 → −1
- If you play A0: they get nothing from you (since you played A0)
- If you play A1: they get 1

But since **you play A0** (dominant), you never play A1.

So P1’s expected payoff:

- If P1 plays A0: base payoff + 0 = 2 (since you play A0)
- If P1 plays A1: base payoff = 0 (you play A0) + (−1 because they play A1) = −1

So P1 prefers A0.

So equilibrium: both play A0.

Your payoff: **2**

Again, **lower than your original 3**.

So is this better? No.

Wait — but in the **original game**, you got 3.

Here, you get only 2.

But is there any chance that **playing A1** gives you more?

From above: no. A1 gives

### **Step 1: Analyze the original game (no contract)**

The payoff matrix (from **Player 2's perspective**, since you are Player 2):

|          | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **You: A0** | 2            | 0            |
| **You: A1** | 3            | 1            |

So, your payoffs are:

- If you play A0:  
  - vs A0 → 2  
  - vs A1 → 0  
- If you play A1:  
  - vs A0 → 3  
  - vs A1 → 1

Now, let’s find the **Nash equilibrium** of this game.

---

#### **Best responses:**

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p).

Your expected payoff:

- E(A0) = p×2 + (1−p)×0 = 2p
- E(A1) = p×3 + (1−p)×1 = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1

Compare:
- E(A1) − E(A0) = (2p + 1) − 2p = 1 > 0 ⇒ A1 always gives you **more than A0**, **regardless of p**.

So, **A1 strictly dominates A0** for you, the Player 2.

Wait — let’s verify:  
- If p = 0 (Player 1 plays A1 always):  
  - A0 gives 0, A1 gives 1 → A1 better  
- If p = 1 (Player 1 plays A0 always):  
  - A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 → A1 better  
- If p = 0.5:  
  - A0: 2×0.5 = 1  
  - A1: 2×0.5 + 1 = 2 → still better

So **A1 is strictly dominant** for Player 2.

Now, what about Player 1?

Player 1’s payoffs (from their own view):
|          | You (P2): A0 | You (P2): A1 |

| **P1: A0** | 2            | 3            |
| **P1: A1** | 0            | 1            |

For Player 1:
- If you (P2) play A0: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → A0 better
- If you (P2) play A1: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → A0 better

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1.

Thus, the unique **Nash equilibrium** is:
- P1 plays A0 (with probability 1),
- P2 plays A1 (with probability 1)

**Outcome**: You choose A1, Player 1 chooses A0 → you get **3 points**, Player 1 gets **0 points**.

So in the baseline game, you get **3 points** by playing A1. And since A1 dominates, you will always play A1 if uncontracted.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract mechanism**

Contracts are **only applied if both players approve them** (via approval voting), and the **winning contract is chosen uniformly at random among those with the maximum approvals**.

Each contract modifies the base payoff by adding or subtracting points based on your action, and these are **distributed among players**.

You are Player 2. You are allowed to **approve or reject** each contract.

> **Your goal**: Maximize your **expected total points** across all possible outcomes.

But note: **You don’t get to pick which contract is applied** — only the ones approved will be in the running, and one is chosen at random from the most-approved ones.

So to maximize your chance of a good expected payoff, you want to:
- Approve contracts that **increase your expected payoff**,
- Reject contracts that **decrease your expected payoff**, or
- That are **ambiguous**, but especially if the risk is high.

However, **you don’t control which contract is selected**, only **which ones are eligible**.

So:
- If you approve a contract that benefits you, it increases the chance that a favorable contract is chosen (if no better one comes along).
- If you approve a contract that harms you, it might be selected and harm you — unless there’s a better one.

But since **the winning contract is chosen at random among the most-approved ones**, your strategic move is:
- **Approve only contracts that you believe are better for you** than the baseline (or offer a safer/linear improvement),
- **Reject contracts that hurt you**, even if they might help the other player.

Let’s now analyze each contract.

---

### **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

This is a **symmetric rule**, applied to both players.

Let’s analyze how this changes the **payoff matrix** from **your (Player 2)** view.

#### How does it modify payoffs?

Let’s denote the **base payoff** + **contract adjustment**.

**Case 1: You play A0, Player 1 plays A0**
- Base: you get 2
- You choose A0 → get +1
- Player 1 chooses A0 → gets +1
- So the +1 to you is **drawn from the other player (P1)** → P1 pays you 1
- So net: You get 2 + 1 = **3**
- P1 gets 2 — 1 = **1**

Wait — the contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- When P1 chooses A0 → he pays 1, goes to you (P2)?  
But it says **"drawn from the other players"** — plural? But there is only one other player.

Re-reading: "drawn equally from the other players" → if there is only one other player, then **the full 1 is taken from that player**.

So:
- When **any player chooses A0**, they get +1, **paid by the other player** (since there is only one other).
- When **any player chooses A1**, they pay -1, **paid to the other player** (distributed to other players — again, only one).

So **this contract is symmetric**.

So for any player:
- A0 → **+1**, paid by opponent
- A1 → **−1**, paid to opponent

So for **you (P2)**:

| P1 \ You | A0           | A1          |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| A0       | 2 + 1 = 3    | 3 − 1 = 2   |
| A1       | 0 − 1 = -1   | 1 + 1 = 2   |

Wait: let’s go step by step.

#### Full payoff modification (with contract):

Let’s suppose:
- Both players choose actions: your action and P1’s action.

Then payoffs are:
- Base payoff (from original game) + contract adjustment

**Contract adjustment rules**:
- For **each player**, if they play A0 → +1 → paid by opponent
- If they play A1 → −1 → paid to opponent

So the **net effect on your total payoff** is:
- If you play A0 → +1
- If you play A1 → −1
- If opponent plays A0 → you pay them 1
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 1 from them

So total change to **your payoff**:
= (your action impact) + (opponent’s action impact)

= [1 if you play A0 else -1] + [1 if opponent plays A1 else -1]

So your **total payoff under contract C1** is:

> Base payoff + (if you play A0: +1) + (if you play A1: -1) + (if P1 plays A1: +1) + (if P1 plays A0: -1)

Wait, no: the contract **alters individual payoffs**, not total.

Let’s define:
- Your payoff under C1 = **base payoff** + **adjustment from your choice** + **adjustment from opponent’s choice**

But the adjustment **on your payoff**:
- When YOU choose A0: you get +1 → so +1 added
- When YOU choose A1: you pay 1 → so -1 added
- When OPPONENT chooses A0: you pay 1 → so -1 added
- When OPPONENT chooses A1: you get 1 → so +1 added

So net adjustment for **your payoff**:
→ +1 if you play A0  
→ −1 if you play A1  
→ −1 if opponent plays A0  
→ +1 if opponent plays A1

So total adjustment:
= (1 if you play A0 else -1) + (1 if opponent plays A1 else -1)

Let’s make a table for **your payoff under C1**:

| P1 \ You | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | base 2 + (+1) + (-1) = 2 | base 0 + (-1) + (-1) = -2 |
| A1       | base 3 + (+1) + (+1) = 5 | base 1 + (-1) + (+1) = 1 |

So:

| Your action | Opponent action | Base | Adjusted payoff (C1) |
|-------------|-----------------|------|-----------------------|
| A0          | A0              | 2    | 2 + 1 − 1 = 2         |
| A0          | A1              | 0    | 0 + 1 − 1 = 0         |
| A1          | A0              | 3    | 3 − 1 − 1 = 1         |
| A1          | A1              | 1    | 1 − 1 + 1 = 1         |

Wait — that doesn't make sense. The adjustment depends on both actions.

Let’s recast the adjustment part correctly:

**Adjustment to your payoff**:
- From your own action: +1 if A0, −1 if A1
- From opponent's action: −1 if opponent plays A0 (you pay them), +1 if opponent plays A1 (you get from them)

So:

- (You A0, P1 A0): your adj = +1 (A0) + (−1 for P1 A0) = 0 → total payoff: 2 + 0 = 2
- (You A0, P1 A1): your adj = +1 + (+1) = +2 → 0 + 2 = 2
- (You A1, P1 A0): adj = −1 + (−1) = −2 → 3 − 2 = 1
- (You A1, P1 A1): adj = −1 + (+1) = 0 → 1 + 0 = 1

So adjusted payoffs:

|          | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|----------|-------|-------|
| You A0   | 2     | 2     |
| You A1   | 1     | 1     |

Oh! So **regardless of what you do**, if P1 plays A0, you get 2 if A0, 1 if A1 — but A0 better.

Wait: under C1, **if you play A0**, you always get 2  
If you play A1, you always get 1

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for **you** under C1.

So you will play A0 with 100% probability (you want to maximize your payoff, and A0 gives 2 every time).

But now, what about **Player 1’s incentives**?

Let’s compute Player 1’s payoffs under C1 (from P1’s perspective):

Adjustment for P1:
- If P1 plays A0: +1 (from their choice) → paid by you
- If P1 plays A1: −1 → paid to you
- If you play A0: P1 pays you 1 → so P1 loses 1
- If you play A1: P1 gains 1 → so benefits

So P1’s adjustment:
= (1 if P1 plays A0) + (1 if you play A1) → wait no:
- When P1 plays A0: +1 (from choice)
- When P1 plays A1: −1
- When *you* play A0: P1 pays 1 → −1 to P1
- When *you* play A1: P1 gets 1 → +1 to P1

So P1’s total payoff under C1:

| You \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | 2 (base) + 1 (P1 A0) − 1 (you A0) = 2 | 3 (base) − 1 (P1 A1) − 1 (you A0) = 1 |
| A1       | 0 (base) + 1 (P1 A0) + 1 (you A1) = 2 | 1 (base) − 1 (P1 A1) + 1 (you A1) = 1 |

So P1’s payoff matrix:

| You \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | 2  | 1  |
| A1       | 2  | 1  |

So P1 gets 2 if they play A0, 1 if they play A1 — regardless of your choice.

So **P1 strictly prefers A0**.

Therefore, under C1:
- You (P2) want to play A0 (dominant)
- P1 wants to play A0 (dominant)

So equilibrium: **both play A0**

Your payoff: **2**

But in the **original game**, you got **3** by playing A1.

So **this contract reduces your payoff from 3 to 2**.

Even though you are forced into A0, you get only 2 vs original 3.

So this contract is **bad for you**.

> **C1 makes you worse off**.

Also, note: the contract is **symmetric**, but since you are in a position where you naturally do well by playing A1 (because P1 plays A0), forcing both to play A0 harms you.

Therefore, **you should reject C1**.

But wait: is there a chance that this contract induces better coordination?

Even though the equilibrium is (A0,A0), you get only 2, which is worse than 3.

So **you are worse off under C1**.

So **do not approve C1**.

### **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2 (that's you!)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So only A1 triggers a payment.

- If you choose A1 → you pay 1 → goes to other player (P1)
- If you choose A0 → no change
- If P1 chooses A1 → P1 pays 1 → goes to you (P2)

So for **your payoff (Player 2)**:

Adjustment:
- If you play A1 → you pay 1 → −1
- If you play A0 → 0
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 1 → +1

So your **net adjustment** depends on both actions.

Now, let’s compute your updated payoffs:

| P1 \ You | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | 2 + 0 (no adj) + 0 (P1 A0) = 2 | 0 + (−1 for you A1) + 0 = −1 |
| A1       | 3 + 0 + 1 (P1 A1) = 4 | 1 + (−1) + 1 = 1 |

So adjusted payoffs:

| You \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | 2  | 4  |
| A1       | −1 | 1  |

Now, let’s find best responses.

For you:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 2, A1 gives −1 → best: A0
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 4, A1 gives 1 → best: A0

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you.

So you will play A0.

Now what about P1?

Payoffs for P1 under C2:

- If P1 plays A0: no payment → 0
- If P1 plays A1: pays 1 → −1
- If you play A0: they get nothing from you (since you played A0)
- If you play A1: they get 1

But since **you play A0** (dominant), you never play A1.

So P1’s expected payoff:

- If P1 plays A0: base payoff + 0 = 2 (since you play A0)
- If P1 plays A1: base payoff = 0 (you play A0) + (−1 because they play A1) = −1

So P1 prefers A0.

So equilibrium: both play A0.

Your payoff: **2**

Again, **lower than your original 3**.

So is this better? No.

Wait — but in the **original game**, you got 3.

Here, you get only 2.

But is there any chance that **playing A1** gives you more?

From above: no. A1 gives

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!


Instruction:
- Choose a probability distribution over the provided actions each round.
- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game Payoffs
The original payoffs (for me, Player 1) are:
- (A0, A0): I get 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 1

## Step 2: Apply the Contract
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0: they receive +2 points (paid by the other player)
- If a player chooses A1: no additional payments

Since there are 2 players, the payment comes from/goes to the other player.

## Step 3: Calculate Modified Payoffs

Let me calculate my total payoff for each outcome:

**Case (A0, A0):** 
- Base: 2
- I chose A0, so I receive: +2 (from other player)
- Other chose A0, so I pay: -2 (to other player)
- **Total: 2 + 2 - 2 = 2**

**Case (A0, A1):**
- Base: 0
- I chose A0, so I receive: +2 (from other player)
- Other chose A1, so I pay: 0
- **Total: 0 + 2 = 2**

**Case (A1, A0):**
- Base: 3
- I chose A1, so I receive: 0
- Other chose A0, so I pay: -2 (to other player)
- **Total: 3 - 2 = 1**

**Case (A1, A1):**
- Base: 1
- I chose A1, so I receive: 0
- Other chose A1, so I pay: 0
- **Total: 1**

## Step 4: Analyze the Strategy

My payoff matrix with the contract:
```
               Other plays A0    Other plays A1
I play A0            2                 2
I play A1            1                 1
```

## Step 5: Determine Optimal Strategy

A0 is a **dominant strategy**! Regardless of what the other player does, choosing A0 gives me 2 points while choosing A1 gives me only 1 point.

Expected payoff from A0: Always 2
Expected payoff from A1: Always 1

Therefore, I should always choose A0.

To maximize your points in this game, we must first analyze the payoff structure after considering the impact of the contract.

### 1. Identify the Base Payoffs (P1: Other Player, P2: You)
Based on the payoff description:
*   (P1: A0, P2: A0) = P1: 2, P2: 2
*   (P1: A1, P2: A0) = P1: 3, P2: 0 (You choose A0, other chooses A1)
*   (P1: A0, P2: A1) = P1: 0, P2: 3 (You choose A1, other chooses A0)
*   (P1: A1, P2: A1) = P1: 1, P2: 1

### 2. Apply the Payment Contract
The contract specifies:
*   Choosing **A0** results in receiving 2 points from the other player.
*   Choosing **A1** involves no additional transfers.

Let's calculate the adjusted payoffs:
*   **Case (A0, A0):** Both choose A0. Both receive 2 points and both pay 2 points.
    *   P1: 2 (base) + 2 (contract) - 2 (contract) = **2**
    *   P2: 2 (base) + 2 (contract) - 2 (contract) = **2**
*   **Case (A1, A0):** P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0. P2 receives 2 points from P1.
    *   P1: 3 (base) - 2 (to P2) = **1**
    *   P2: 0 (base) + 2 (from P1) = **2**
*   **Case (A0, A1):** P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1. P1 receives 2 points from P2.
    *   P1: 0 (base) + 2 (from P2) = **2**
    *   P2: 3 (base) - 2 (to P1) = **1**
*   **Case (A1, A1):** Neither receives or pays extra points.
    *   P1: 1 (base) = **1**
    *   P2: 1 (base) = **1**

### 3. Analyze the Adjusted Payoff Matrix (P2's perspective)
| | P1 chooses A0 | P1 chooses A1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P2 chooses A0** | 2 points | 2 points |
| **P2 chooses A1** | 1 point | 1 point |

### 4. Conclusion
Regardless of what Player 1 chooses, choosing **A0** always yields 2 points, whereas choosing **A1** always yields 1 point. A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy**. By choosing A0 with 100% probability, you guarantee yourself the maximum possible individual payoff (2 points) in any scenario.

response:
To decide whether to sign the payment contract, let's evaluate how the contract affects the payoff matrix for both players and whether it maximizes my total points.

First, we'll rewrite the original payoffs considering the additional payment specified in the contract. The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 1 point from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point to the other player.

We'll update the payoff matrix accordingly.

Original Payoff Matrix:
- If both choose A0: You get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: You get 1 point, the other player gets 1 point.

Updated Payoff Matrix with the Contract:
- Both choose A0:
  - You: 2 + 1 = 3 points, Other player: 2 + 1 = 3 points.
- You choose A0, the other chooses A1:
  - You: 0 + 1 = 1 point, Other player: 3 - 1 = 2 points.
- You choose A1, the other chooses A0:
  - You: 3 - 1 = 2 points, Other player: 0 + 1 = 1 point.
- Both choose A1:
  - You: 1 - 1 = 0 points, Other player: 1 - 1 = 0 points.

Updated Payoff Matrix:
- A0, A0: (3, 3)
- A0, A1: (1, 2)
- A1, A0: (2, 1)
- A1, A1: (0, 0)

Next, we analyze whether signing the contract is beneficial based on the updated payoff matrix to ensure that it maximizes our total points.

From the updated matrix, the outcomes:
- Both choosing A0 results in maximum points for both players: (3, 3).
- Mixed strategies (A0, A1) or (A1, A0) yield (1, 2) or (2, 1), respectively.
- Both choosing A1 results in (0, 0), the minimum possible points for both players.

Given that if both players sign the contract and both choose A0, we receive the highest points (3 each). The contract aligns incentives such that choosing A0 becomes more attractive compared to choosing A1 because of the additional points.

Therefore, signing the contract provides a clear improvement on potential outcomes compared to not signing it, especially if there is cooperation and the other player also chooses A0.

So, the final decision is to sign the contract.

  "sign": true

The payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): I get 2

- (A1, A1): I get 1

Without the contract, A1 dominates A0:
- If other plays A0: A1 gives me 3 vs A0 gives me 2
- If other plays A1: A1 gives me 1 vs A0 gives me 0

**Nash equilibrium without contract: Both play A1, both get 1 point**

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract imposes a 2-point penalty on choosing A1 (paid to the other player).

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 2, other gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0+2=2 (I receive other's penalty), other gets 3-2=1
- (A1, A0): I get 3-2=1 (I pay penalty), other gets 0+2=2  
- (A1, A1): I get 1 (penalties cancel), other gets 1

Now A0 strictly dominates A1:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 2 vs A1 gives me 1
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 2 vs A1 gives me 1

**Nash equilibrium with contract: Both play A0, both get 2 points**

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: Expected payoff = 1
- **With contract**: Expected payoff = 2

## Step 4: Consider signing decision

- If I sign and other signs → contract active → I get 2 ✓
- If I sign and other doesn't → contract inactive → I get 1
- If I don't sign → contract inactive → I get 1

Since the other player faces the same symmetric incentives and also benefits from the contract (2 vs 1), a rational other player will also sign. Signing gives me the potential for a better outcome (2) with no downside risk (minimum 1 either way).

**Conclusion: I should sign the contract.**

response:
To evaluate which contracts to approve, I need to analyze how each proposed contract changes the incentive structure and payoffs of the game. Let's break it down step by step:

### Original Payoff Matrix Without Contracts:
```
           | Player 2: A0  | Player 2: A1
------------------------------------------
Player 1: A0 | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)
------------------------------------------
Player 1: A1 | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)
```

### Contract #1 (Proposed by Player 1):
- A player choosing A0 receives 1 additional point from the other player.
- A player choosing A1 has no additional payments or deductions.

| Final Actions  | Original Payoff | Contract Payment | Final Payoff         |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| (P1: A0, P2: A0) | (2, 2)         | (+1, -1)        | (3, 1)               |
| (P1: A0, P2: A1) | (0, 3)         | (+1, -1)        | (1, 2)               |
| (P1: A1, P2: A0) | (3, 0)         | ( 0,  0)        | (3, 0)               |
| (P1: A1, P2: A1) | (1, 1)         | ( 0,  0)        | (1, 1)               |

Player 1's strategies:
- Choosing A0 guarantees a payment of 1 point from Player 2
- Choosing A1 gains no extra points

Player 2's strategies:
- Choosing A0 loses a point to Player 1 but gains an extra point from choosing A0 against A1
- Choosing A1 neither loses nor gains extra points


### Contract #2 (Proposed by Player 2):
- A player choosing A0 receives 1 additional point from the other player.
- A player choosing A1 pays 1 additional point to the other player.

| Final Actions  | Original Payoff | Contract Payment | Final Payoff         |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| (P1: A0, P2: A0) | (2, 2)         | (+1, -1)         | (3, 1)              |
| (P1: A0, P2: A1) | (0, 3)         | (+1, -1)         | (1, 2)              |
| (P1: A1, P2: A0) | (3, 0)         | (-1, +1)         | (2, 1)              |
| (P1: A1, P2: A1) | (1, 1)         | (-1, +1)         | (0, 2)              |

Player 1's strategies:
- Choosing A0 gains 1 additional point from Player 2
- Choosing A1 loses 1 point to Player 2

Player 2's strategies:
- Choosing A0 loses 1 point to Player 1
- Choosing A1 gains 1 point from Player 1

### Analysis:
#### Contract 1:
- Weakens choosing A0 for Player 2 by making it costly, encourages A1 to some extent
- Strengthens choosing A0 for Player 1, making it over-invested in A0 strategies, gaining decisive advantage in A1 vs A0 scenarios

#### Contract 2:
- Maintains symmetry in payments based equally for both A0 and A1 across the players.
- Balances choices by imposing losses and gains on both move strategies equivalently.

Given contract #2 balances strategies while preserving the integrity of payoff structures and likely leading towards an honest and strategically symmetric payoff, I will approve:
```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}
```

response:
Let's go step by step to determine which contract(s) Player 1 (you) should approve in order to **maximize your total expected points**, given the structure of the game and the contract voting mechanism.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

This is a 2-player simultaneous move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

This is similar to a **coordination game with a conflict of interest**:
- Mutual A0: (2, 2) → best for both
- Mutual A1: (1, 1) → worst for both
- A0 vs A1: one gets 3, the other 0 → strong incentive to mismatch

This is **not** a Prisoner's Dilemma, but rather a **battle of the sexes** or **coordination game with a dominant strategy conflict**.

Let’s analyze Nash equilibria in pure strategies:
- (A0, A0): Both get 2. If Player 1 deviates to A1, gets 3, so better → not Nash.
- (A1, A1): Both get 1. If Player 1 deviates to A0, gets 0 → worse. So Player 1 won't deviate. Similarly for Player 2 → so (A1, A1) is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.
- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0, would prefer A1 to get 1 → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3, but Player 2 gets 0 → Player 2 would prefer to switch to A1 → not equilibrium.

So only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), which gives both 1 point. But (A0, A0) would be better for both.

There’s also a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, which we might consider later if needed.

But now we’re introducing contracts.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

There are **two contracts proposed**:
- **C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**:  
  - If you play A0 → get +1 point (paid by the other player).  
  - If you play A1 → no additional payment.

- **C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**:  
  - If you play A0 → get +2 point (paid by the other player).  
  - If you play A1 → no additional payment.

**Important: Payments are drawn equally from the other player.** So if you get +1 for A0, the other player loses 1.

So for example, under **C1**:
- If both play A0: (2 + 1, 2 + 1) = (3, 3) → both get +1
- If I play A0, they play A1: (0 + 1, 3 - 1) = (1, 2)
- If I play A1, they play A0: (3 - 1, 0 + 1) = (2, 1)
- If both play A1: (1, 1) → no change

Similarly for C2:
- A0 players get +2 (other loses 2)

The contract **only activates if both players agree** (via approval voting). The winning contract is **randomly selected from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

Your goal: **maximize your total expected points**.

But note: **you are Player 1**, and you're choosing which contracts to approve.

Crucially, **other players (Player 2) may also approve contracts independently**. But we **do not know** how Player 2 will vote.

So to make a rational decision, we must consider:
- Your **self-interest** (maximize your expected points in the resulting game)
- The **voting mechanism**: the contract with the **most approvals** wins, and if tied, **one is selected uniformly at random**

Therefore, you should **only approve contracts that increase your expected payoff**, **assuming rational play by both players**, and **accounting for the possibility that other contracts may be approved too**.

But here's the catch: **You cannot observe the other player's vote**. So you must consider best responses and likely outcomes.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Impact of Contracts on the Game**

Let’s compute the **modified payoff matrices** for both contracts.

---

#### **C1: +1 to A0 player, paid by opponent**

Modified payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

|           | A0         | A1         |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **A0**    | (3, 3)     | (1, 2)     |
| **A1**    | (2, 1)     | (1, 1)     |

- (A0,A0): +1 each → (3,3)
- (A0,A1): You (P1) get 0+1 = 1, P2 gets 3-1 = 2 → (1,2)
- (A1,A0): You get 3-1 = 2, P2 gets 0+1 = 1 → (2,1)
- (A1,A1): no change → (1,1)

Now check for equilibria.

- (A0, A0): If P1 deviates to A1 → gets 2 < 3 → no
  - P2 deviates → gets 1 < 3 → no → **Nash equilibrium**

- (A1, A1): If P1 deviates to A0 → gets 1 < 2? Wait: P1 gets 1 vs 1 → same → indifferent. But if indifferent, might stick, but not better → no incentive to deviate. But if P1 deviates, gets 1, same as before. So not strictly worse. So possible equilibrium.

But let’s check best responses:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 prefers A0 (3) > A1 (2)
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 3 (A0) > 1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

So **(A0, A0)** is a strict Nash equilibrium (both strictly prefer it).

And (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium only because both are indifferent.

But now, **(A0, A0) is strongly preferred**.

So **C1 likely induces coordination on (A0, A0)**, giving each player 3.

Now look at **C2: +2 to A0 player, paid by opponent**

Modified matrix:

|           | A0         | A1         |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **A0**    | (4, 4)     | (2, 1)     |
| **A1**    | (1, 2)     | (1, 1)     |

Breakdown:
- (A0,A0): (2+2, 2+2) = (4,4)
- (A0,A1): (0+2, 3-2) = (2,1)
- (A1,A0): (3-2, 0+2) = (1,2)
- (A1,A1): (1,1)

Now analyze:

- If P2 plays A0: P1 prefers A0 (4) > A1 (1)
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
  → So **P1 always wants to play A0** (strictly best response)

- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 4 (A0) > 1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
  → So **P2 always wants to play A0**

**Therefore: (A0, A0) is the unique Nash equilibrium** under C2. Both players have a dominant strategy to play A0.

So under **C2**, the game **forces coordination on A0**, both players get 4 points.

This is even better than C1 where both get 3.

---

### **Step 4: Compare Contract Outcomes for Player 1**

| Contract | Your payoff in equilibrium | Other player’s payoff |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Base game (no contract) | 1 (only A1,A1 equilibrium) or potentially 2.5 (if mixed) | 1 or similar |
| C1 | 3 (in (A0,A0)) | 3 |
| C2 | 4 (in (A0,A0)) | 4 |

So **C2 gives you 4**, **C1 gives you 3**, **base game gives at most 2 (if coordinated on A0)** or 1 in worst case.

So clearly, **C2 is best for you**.

But **C2 was proposed by Player 2**. Will **Player 2 approve it?**

Let’s analyze **Player 2’s incentives**.

Under C2:
- If Player 2 plays A0, gets +2 → good
- If Player 2 plays A1, gets 0 bonus → no change
- So Player 2 wants to play A0
- And in fact, regardless of what Player 1 does, Player 2 **prefers A0** (gets 4 vs 1 if A0, and 2 vs 1 if A1) → so A0 is dominant strategy.

So **Player 2 has strong incentive to approve C2**.

Will Player 1 (you) approve C2?

Yes — because it gives you **4 points**, your maximum possible payoff.

Now, what about **C1 (your own proposal)?**

C1 also leads to (A0,A0) → you get 3.

But C2 gives you 4.

So clearly, you prefer C2.

Now, **should you approve C1?**

Well, you could approve both C1 and C2.

But the **contract with the most approvals wins**, and if tied, **one is chosen at random**.

Suppose you approve **both** C1 and C2.

- If Player 2 approves **only C2**:
  - C1: 1 approval (you only)
  - C2: 2 approvals (you + Player 2)
  → C2 wins → you get 4

- If Player 2 approves **only C1**:
  - C1: 2 approvals
  - C2: 1 approval
  → C1 wins → you get 3

- If Player 2 approves **both**:
  - Both have 2 approvals → random winner → 50% chance C1 (you get 3), 50% chance C2 (you get 4) → **expected payoff: 3.5**

- If Player 2 approves **neither**:
  - Only you approve C1 → C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → both have 1 approval → one is chosen uniformly → 50% chance C1 (you get 3), 50% chance C2 (you get 4) → **expected payoff: 3.5**

But wait — that’s only if you approve both.

Is there a **better strategy**?

Suppose you **approve only C2**.

Then:

- If Player 2 approves C2:
  - C2 has 2 approvals → wins → you get 4
- If Player 2 does **not** approve C2:
  - C2: 1 approval (you), C1: 0 → so C2 wins (only one with approval) → you get 4

So no matter what Player 2 does, **if you approve only C2**, **C2 wins**!

Why?
- If Player 2 approves C2: C2 has 2 approvals → wins
- If Player 2 does not approve C2: C2 has 1 (your approval), and C1 has 0 (you didn't approve C1) → C2 has the highest count (1 > 0) → wins

So **if you approve only C2**, C2 **always wins**.

You get **4 points for sure**.

Now suppose you approve **both**.

Then:
- If Player 2 approves **only C2**: C2 wins → you get 4
- If Player 2 approves **only C1**: C1 wins → you get 3
- If Player 2 approves **both**: both have 2 → random → 50% chance 3, 50% chance 4 → expected 3.5
- If Player 2 approves **neither**: C1: 1, C2: 1 → tie → random → expected 3.5

So your **expected payoff** when you approve both depends on Player 2’s behavior.

We don’t know how Player 2 votes, but **we can assume Player 2 acts rationally**.

Player 2 knows:
- Under **C1**: if both approve, they get 3 points
- Under **C2**: if both approve, they get 4 points

So **Player 2 strictly prefers C2**, because:
- Under C2: they get 4 points regardless of your vote, and it’s a dominant strategy
- Under C1: they get 3 points only if both play A0 (which happens)

So **Player 2 will definitely approve C2**, because it gives them **more** regardless.

Will they approve C1?

- C1 gives Player 2 3 points max (in (A0,A0))
- But under **C2**, they get **4 points**, which is better.

So **no incentive** to approve C1 if they can get C2.

Moreover, **C2 is better for them**, so they will always approve C2.

But can they approve both? Possibly.

Still, **C2 is strictly better for them**, so even if they approve both, **they have no reason to reject C2**.

So **Player 2 will approve C2**.

Now: **Will Player 2 approve C1?**

C1 is worse for them than C2. So **if they have to choose**, they will prefer C2.

But **they can approve multiple contracts**.

However, approving C1 **only adds a cost if C1 wins**, because then they get 3 instead of 4.

But **since C2 is already approved by both players, C2 will win no matter what** (2 approvals), so **C1 will never win**.

So if Player 2 approves C1, it doesn’t help them — but it also doesn’t hurt.

But why would they approve C1? They get 3 instead of 4. So unless there’s no cost, they would **not** approve C1.

But there’s **no cost to approving** — it only matters for the approval count.

But **approving C1 gives no benefit** to Player 2, and **only risk** that it might **block C2** from winning — but C2 has your approval and theirs, so it will win anyway.

So **Player 2 has no reason to approve C1**.

Therefore, **Player 2 will approve C2 and **not** approve C1**.

---

### **Step 5: Final Expected Outcome Based on Your Approval Strategy**

Let’s test your options.

#### **Option 1: Approve only C2**
- You: approve C2
- Player 2: approves C2, not C1
→ C2: 2 approvals, C1: 0 → C2 wins → you get 4 points → **perfect outcome**

#### **Option 2: Approve only C1**
- You: approve C1
- Player 2: approves C2 (not C1)
→ C1: 1 approval (you), C2: 1 approval (P2) → tie → random winner → 50% chance C1 → you get 3, 50% chance C2 → you get 4 → expected: 3.5 → worse than 4

#### **Option 3: Approve both C1 and C2**
- You: approve both
- Player 2: approves C2 only
→ C1: 1 approval, C2: 2 → C2 wins → you get 4 → same as Option 1

But you approved C1 unnecessarily, which doesn’t help and **adds risk** only if Player 2 also approved C1 — but they won’t.

So **approving only C2 is optimal**.

You get **4 for sure**, no risk.

Approving both C1 gives you **no advantage** — **C2 still wins** — and you don’t gain anything extra.

So **only approve C2**.

---

### **Final Decision: Should you approve each contract?**

- **C1**: Proposed by you. But you get only 3 if it wins, vs 4 if C2 wins. And **C2 will win anyway**, so don't approve C1.
- **C2**: You get 4. **Will definitely win** if you approve it (and Player 2 will also approve it). So **approve C2**.

---

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game
The original payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 1

## Step 2: Understand the Contract
The contract specifies:
- If I choose A0: I receive +1 from the other player
- If I choose A1: I pay -1 to the other player
- If other chooses A0: They receive +1 from me (I pay -1)
- If other chooses A1: They pay -1 to me (I receive +1)

## Step 3: Calculate Net Contract Effects
For each outcome, the net effect on my payoff from the contract:
- (My A0, Other A0): I get +1 for choosing A0, lose -1 for other's A0 = **0 net**
- (My A0, Other A1): I get +1 for choosing A0, get +1 for other's A1 = **+2 net**
- (My A1, Other A0): I lose -1 for choosing A1, lose -1 for other's A0 = **-2 net**
- (My A1, Other A1): I lose -1 for choosing A1, get +1 for other's A1 = **0 net**

## Step 4: Calculate Total Payoffs with Contract
Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 2 + 0 = **2 points**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 = **2 points**
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 = **1 point**
- (A1, A1): 1 + 0 = **1 point**

## Step 5: Determine Optimal Strategy
My payoff matrix becomes:
```
           Other A0  Other A1
My A0         2         2
My A1         1         1
```

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - I get 2 points with A0 regardless of opponent's choice, versus only 1 point with A1.

Therefore, my optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Let me work through this step by step.

## Step 1: Analyze the Original Game

Without the contract, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 2, other gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 1, other gets 1

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma. A1 is the dominant strategy for both players:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A1 (3 > 2)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A1 (1 > 0)

Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get **1 point**

## Step 2: Analyze the Game WITH the Contract

The contract adds:
- Choosing A0: receive +1 from other player
- Choosing A1: pay +1 to other player

New payoffs with contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 2 + 1 (receive) - 1 (pay) = **2**
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 1 (receive for A0) + 1 (other pays for A1) = **2**
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 1 (pay for A1) - 1 (other receives for A0) = **1**
- (A1, A1): I get 1 - 1 (pay) + 1 (receive) = **1**

Now check for dominant strategy:
- If other plays A0: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → prefer A0

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy!** The same logic applies to the other player.

Nash equilibrium with contract: (A0, A0) → I get **2 points**

## Step 3: Compare Outcomes

- **Without contract**: Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → 1 point
- **With contract**: Nash equilibrium (A0, A0) → 2 points

## Step 4: Decision Analysis

Since the contract only activates if both players sign:
- If I sign AND other signs: I get 2 points ✓
- If I don't sign OR other doesn't sign: I get 1 point

Given that Player 2 proposed this contract, they likely intend to sign it themselves (it benefits them equally). Signing is at least as good as not signing, and potentially better.

**Conclusion**: I should sign the contract.

response:
Let's analyze this decision step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game without the contract**

We are Player 2. The original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:

|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (2, 2) | (0, 3) |
| **P2: A1** | (3, 0) | (1, 1) |

This is a classic **coordination** vs **conflict** type of game. It resembles a variant of the **Battle of the Sexes** or a **prisoner's dilemma**-like structure, but let's analyze the incentives.

We can check for dominant strategies:

- For **Player 2**:
  - If P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1
  - If P1 chooses A1: P2 gets 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A1
  - So **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for Player 2.

- For **Player 1**:
  - If P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefers A0
  - If P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
  - So **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy** for Player 1.

Thus, in the original game, the **Nash equilibrium** is (A0, A1) — both players play optimally given the other’s choice — **but wait**: this can't be stable. Let’s double-check:

- If P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A1 → outcome (A0, A1) → P2 gets 3, P1 gets 0
- If P2 plays A1, P1 prefers A0 → same outcome

But now consider: if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1 → P2 gets 3, P1 gets 0 → P1 would want to deviate: if P1 switches to A1, he gets 1 instead of 0 → actually, wait:

Wait: In the payoff table, if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1 → (P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3)  
If P1 switches to A1 → now (A1, A1) → P1 gets 1 → **better than 0** → so P1 *will* deviate.

So (A0, A1) is **not** a Nash equilibrium.

Check (A1, A1): both get 1.  
If P1 deviates to A0: (A0, A1) → P1 gets 0 → worse → no incentive  
If P2 deviates to A0: (A1, A0) → P2 gets 0 → worse → no incentive  
So **(A1, A1)** is a Nash equilibrium.

Check (A0, A0): (2,2).  
If P1 deviates to A1 → (A1, A0) → P1 gets 3 → better → so P1 will deviate  
If P2 deviates to A1 → (A0, A1) → P2 gets 3 → better → so P2 will deviate  
So (A0, A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium.

Check (A1, A0): (3,0)  
P1: if shifts to A0 → (A0, A0) → gets 2 < 3 → no  
P2: if shifts to A1 → (A1, A1) → gets 1 > 0 → wants to deviate  
So not equilibrium.

So the **only pure Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1), where both play A1 and get 1 point each.

But is that the only equilibrium? There might be mixed equilibria. However, for decision-making, we consider: if we expect rational play, we might expect (A1, A1).

But here's the key: **Player 2’s best response is always A1**, regardless of Player 1’s action. So **A1 is strictly dominant** for Player 2.

Player 1’s best response is **always A0**, regardless of Player 2’s action → so **A0 is dominant** for Player 1.

Thus, if both play rationally, we expect **(A0, A1)** → P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3.

But is this a stable equilibrium? As we saw, if P1 is at A0 and P2 at A1 → P1 gets 0 → he would rather switch to A1 and get 1. So P1 has incentive to deviate.

Wait — contradiction: earlier conclusion that A0 is dominant for P1?

Let’s double-check:

- P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A0 → P1 gets 2
- P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1 → P1 gets 0
- P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0 → P1 gets 3
- P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A1 → P1 gets 1

Now, if P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A1 (3 > 2)  
If P2 plays A1, P1 prefers A1 (1 > 0)

So in **both cases**, P1 prefers A1.

Wait! That contradicts what I said earlier.

Let’s correct this:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1: A0 → 2; A1 → 3 → prefers A1
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1: A0 → 0; A1 → 1 → prefers A1

So **A1 is strictly dominant for P1** as well.

But earlier I said A0 is dominant — that was a **mistake**.

So both players have A1 as a strictly dominant strategy?

Let’s see:

P2:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 → 2, A1 → 3 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: A0 → 0, A1 → 1 → prefers A1

Yes — so **A1 is strictly dominant for both players**.

So the unique Nash equilibrium in dominant strategies is **(A1, A1)**, where both get 1 point.

But wait — in (A1, A1): both get 1.

Is there any reason to deviate?

- P1: if switches to A0 with P2 at A1 → P1 gets 0 < 1 → no
- P2: if switches to A0 with P1 at A1 → P2 gets 0 < 1 → no

So yes, (A1, A1) is stable.

But now consider: are there better outcomes?

- (A0, A0): both get 2 → better than (1,1)
- But neither player wants to play A0 unilaterally, because:
  - If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0 (worse than 1)
  - So no incentive to play A0

So (A0, A0) is not stable — both players have incentive to deviate.

So the only stable outcome is (A1, A1) → both get 1.

So without the contract, **rational play leads to (A1, A1)** and each gets 1.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract is proposed by Player 1 and passed by approval voting. It says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

There are two players: you (Player 2) and Player 1. "Other players" means the other single player.

So:

- If you choose **A0**, you get **+1 point** from the other player → so **-1 point** from Player 1's pocket
- If you choose **A1**, you **pay 1 point**, so **-1 point from your own pocket**, and that point goes to Player 1

Similarly for Player 1:
- If P1 chooses A0 → gets +1, paid by you (Player 2)
- If P1 chooses A1 → pays 1 point, paid to you

But note: the contract is **only active if both sign**. So if you don’t sign, the contract doesn’t apply.

We need to decide whether to **sign** or not.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze impact of the contract on game payoffs**

Let’s write the **new** payoff matrix **under the contract**.

The contract adds:
- For choosing A0: +1 → but paid by the other player
- For choosing A1: -1 → paid to the other player

So we must **add** these effects to the base payoffs.

Let’s define the new payoffs (P1's total payoff, P2's total payoff), including the **contract effect**.

Let’s suppose **both sign** → contract is active.

Then:

|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (2 +1, 2 -1) = **(3, 1)** | (0 -1, 3 +1) = **(-1, 4)** |
| **P2: A1** | (3 -1, 0 +1) = **(2, 1)** | (1 +1, 1 -1) = **(2, 0)** |

Wait: careful with signs.

Contract effects:
- **Player 1 plays A0**: gets +1, so **P1 gains +1**, **P2 loses -1**
- **Player 1 plays A1**: pays -1, so **P1 loses -1**, **P2 gains +1**
- **Player 2 plays A0**: gets +1, so P2 gains +1, P1 loses -1
- **Player 2 plays A1**: pays -1, so P2 loses -1, P1 gains +1

So in the (P1 choice, P2 choice) outcome:

Let’s go through each cell:

1. **(A0, A0)**:
   - Base: (2, 2)
   - P1 plays A0: gets +1 → +1 to P1
   - P2 plays A0: gets +1 → +1 to P2
   - Total: (2 +1, 2 +1) = **(3, 3)**

2. **(A0, A1)**:
   - Base: (0, 3)
   - P1 plays A0: +1 to P1
   - P2 plays A1: pays -1 → -1 to P2
   - Total: (0 +1, 3 -1) = **(1, 2)**

3. **(A1, A0)**:
   - Base: (3, 0)
   - P1 plays A1: pays -1 → -1 to P1
   - P2 plays A0: gets +1 → +1 to P2
   - Total: (3 -1, 0 +1) = **(2, 1)**

4. **(A1, A1)**:
   - Base: (1, 1)
   - P1 plays A1: -1
   - P2 plays A1: -1
   - Total: (1 -1, 1 -1) = **(0, 0)**

So the new payoff matrix with contract (both players sign) is:

|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (3, 3) | (1, 2) |
| **P2: A1** | (2, 1) | (0, 0) |

Now, analyze best responses.

**Player 2’s perspective (you):**

- If P1 plays A0:
  - A0: gets 3
  - A1: gets 2 → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - A0: gets 1
  - A1: gets 0 → prefer A0

So **A0 is dominant for Player 2** in the contract game.

**Player 1’s perspective:**

- If P2 plays A0:
  - A0: gets 3
  - A1: gets 2 → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - A0: gets 1
  - A1: gets 0 → prefer A0

So **A0 is also dominant** for Player 1.

Thus, **(A0, A0)** is the unique dominant strategy equilibrium → both get 3.

This is **much better** for both than original (1,1).

In fact, **(3,3)** is the best possible outcome.

So with the contract, the outcome **improves** for both players (from 1 to 3).

---

### **Step 4: Should you sign the contract?**

- If you **sign**, and the contract is in force (i.e., both sign), then the game becomes the above, and **you get 3 points**.
- If you **don’t sign**, then the contract is **not active**, and the game remains the original one, where the equilibrium is (A1, A1) → **you get 1 point**.

BUT: the contract only becomes active **if both sign**. So if you don’t sign, **no contract**, so game is original → you get 1.

But **what if you sign, and Player 1 doesn’t?** Then contract is not active — again, original game.

So the only way the contract helps is if **both sign**.

Now, you need to decide whether to sign or not.

You know:
- Player 1 proposed it.
- It passed by approval voting — so **Player 1 intends to sign**.
- But do you *know* Player 1 will sign?

The problem says: “The contract was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1)” → implies **Player 1 will sign**, and likely the contract is designed so that both must agree.

So assume **Player 1 will sign**.

Therefore, if *you* sign, then **both sign**, contract applies → you get 3 points.

If you do **not sign**, no contract → original game → you get 1 point.

So **signing gives you 3**, not signing gives you **1**.

Thus, **you should sign**.

But is there any risk?

- If Player 1 doesn’t sign, contract not active — you get 1 anyway.
- But if Player 1 signs **and you do**, you get 3.

Since Player 1 proposed it and it passed, likely Player 1 will sign.

And **if Player 1 signs, signing benefits you**.

No downside: not signing never gives you more than 1, and you can get 3 if you sign.

Even if Player 1 was indifferent, but the contract is beneficial for both, and Player 1 proposed it, it’s rational for Player 1 to sign.

So **your best move is to sign**.

response:
Alright, let's break down the decision-making process step-by-step to find the optimal strategy. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Basic Payoff Matrix:**
   - Both choose A0: Each gets 2 points.
   - You choose A0, opponent chooses A1: You get 0 points, opponent gets 3 points.
   - You choose A1, opponent chooses A0: You get 3 points, opponent gets 0 points.
   - Both choose A1: Each gets 1 point.

2. **Considering the Contract:**
   - Choosing A0 gives you an extra 1 point.
   - Choosing A1 deducts 1 point from you and credits the opponent with that point.

3. **Adjusted Payoff Matrix Including Contract:**
   - Both choose A0: Each gets 2 points + 1 (contract) = 3 points.
   - You choose A0, opponent chooses A1: You get 0 points + 1 (contract) = 1 point; Opponent gets 3 points - 1 (contract) = 2 points.
   - You choose A1, opponent chooses A0: You get 3 points - 1 (contract) = 2 points; Opponent gets 0 points + 1 (contract) = 1 point.
   - Both choose A1: Each gets 1 point - 1 (contract) + 1 (contract from the other player) = 1 point.

```
Considering Contract:
- A0, A0: (3, 3)
- A0, A1: (1, 2)
- A1, A0: (2, 1)
- A1, A1: (1, 1)
```

4. **Finding the Optimal Strategy:**
   In order to maximize the expected payoff, we can look at the adjusted payoffs:

   Each player aims to maximize their expected points. Let's calculate the expected values for choosing each action and consider mixed strategies if necessary.

   If you think the opponent will choose A0 with probability `p` and A1 with `1-p`:
   - Expected utility of choosing A0 (EA0):
     \[
     EA0 = 3p + 1(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1
     \]

   - Expected utility of choosing A1 (EA1):
     \[
     EA1 = 2p + 1(1-p) = 2p + 1 - p = p + 1
     \]

   Compare EA0 and EA1:
   - EA0 = EA1 when \( 2p + 1 = p + 1 \).
     This holds for any p.

   The dominant strategy derived from the contract influence obviously makes both actions equally valuable in a mixed strategy.

### Final Distribution

Because choosing between A0 and A1 under this setup leads to similar outcomes, a fair mixed strategy is viable. Setting a mixed probability where each action receives 50% could be a balanced approach, especially given the symmetric impact of the contract.

```json
{
  "A0": 50,
  "A1": 50
}
```

This distribution considers maximizing your total points in a balanced game, reflecting an optimal mixed strategy with this contract influence.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

response:
Both proposed contracts change incentives by creating a 1-point transfer *from the non‑A0 player to the A0 player* whenever exactly one player plays **A0**.

### Step 1: Baseline (no contract)
Your payoffs (Player 2):
- If Player 1 plays A0: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 → prefer A1
- If Player 1 plays A1: A0 gives 0, A1 gives 1 → prefer A1  
So A1 strictly dominates A0; equilibrium outcome is (A1, A1) with payoff 1 each.

### Step 2: Contract C1 effects
C1: playing **A0** gives +1 paid by the other; **A1** has no transfer.

Resulting payoffs for you (P2):
- (A0, A0): still 2 (both receive +1 and pay 1 → net 0)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 1 = 1
- (A1, A0): 3 − 1 = 2
- (A1, A1): still 1

So under C1, you become *indifferent* between A0 and A1 given either action by the other player (no longer strictly dominated). This can allow (A0, A0) to be sustained, giving you 2 instead of 1, without making you worse off in the (A1, A1) outcome.

### Step 3: Contract C2 effects
C2: **A0** gets +1 from the other; **A1** pays 1 to the other.

In a 2-player game, this generates the *same net transfers* and therefore the *same payoff matrix* as C1 in every action profile. So C2 is effectively equivalent to C1 for your payoffs here.

### Step 4: Approval choice
Since C1 and C2 are payoff-equivalent for you in this 2-player setting, approving both cannot reduce your payoff relative to approving only one, and it increases the chance that some (equivalent) contract is selected if approvals matter.

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):

response:
To determine the optimal probabilities for each action, let's start by analyzing the payoffs in different scenarios, both before and after considering the contract.

### Game Payoffs (without the contract)

1. **(A0, A0)**
   - Player 1: 2 points
   - Player 2: 2 points

2. **(A0, A1)**
   - Player 1: 0 points
   - Player 2: 3 points

3. **(A1, A0)**
   - Player 1: 3 points
   - Player 2: 0 points

4. **(A1, A1)**
   - Player 1: 1 point
   - Player 2: 1 point

### Effect of Contract on Payoffs

Since the contract modifies the payoffs, we should update the above outcomes accordingly:

1. **(A0, A0)**
   - Player 1: 2 + 1 = 3 points
   - Player 2: 2 + 1 = 3 points

2. **(A0, A1)**
   - Player 1: 0 + 1 = 1 point
   - Player 2: 3 - 1 = 2 points

3. **(A1, A0)**
   - Player 1: 3 - 1 = 2 points
   - Player 2: 0 + 1 = 1 point

4. **(A1, A1)**
   - Player 1: 1 - 1 = 0 points
   - Player 2: 1 - 1 = 0 points

### Analysis

Now, let's examine the payoffs more closely. Here's how the altered payoffs look:

- (A0, A0): Player 1 = 3, Player 2 = 3
- (A0, A1): Player 1 = 1, Player 2 = 2
- (A1, A0): Player 1 = 2, Player 2 = 1
- (A1, A1): Player 1 = 0, Player 2 = 0

If we assume that both players are rational and aiming to maximize their own payoffs, they will consider the following:

- The safest mutual strategy seems to be choosing (A0, A0), resulting in a relatively high and equal payoff of 3 points each.
- Risks are involved in choosing A1 because it might end up in (A1, A1), or if the other player chooses A0, the payoffs are lower compared to (A0, A0).

Given the new payoffs and the contract's effect, the least risky and potentially high-payout strategy accommodates choosing action A0 frequently.

### Optimal Strategy

To maximize points, it would be prudent to choose A0 most of the time. Given the incentive structure, we might model a high probability for A0.

**Final Decision:**

Here is the JSON output for the probability distribution:

```json
{
  "A0": 90,
  "A1": 10
}
```

This approach adopts A0 with a high probability, but still retains a small probability for A1 to keep the strategy slightly unpredictable.

Let's carefully analyze this decision-making game step by step, considering the original game, the proposed contracts, and how they affect incentives and payoffs.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Symmetric 2x2 Game)**

The base game is a simultaneous move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

This is a **coordination game with a conflict of interest**, similar to a **battle of the sexes** variant, but not quite symmetric.

- (A0, A0): Both get 2 → best outcome for both?
- (A1, A1): Both get 1 → worse than (A0, A0)
- (A0, A1): You get 0, opponent gets 3 → bad for you
- (A1, A0): You get 3, opponent gets 0 → good for you

So:
- You prefer A1 when opponent plays A0
- You prefer A0 when opponent plays A1
- You both prefer (A0, A0) over (A1, A1)
- But there is a **conflict**: both want to play A1 when the other plays A0, and vice versa.

This implies **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). But (A0, A0) is **Pareto superior**.

But wait, (A0, A0) gives 2 each, (A1, A1) gives 1 each → so (A0, A0) is better for both.

However, (A1, A0) gives 3 to you → so you'd want to deviate from (A0, A0) if you believe the other will play A0? Not quite — but let's look at best responses.

#### Best Responses:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1's best response: A1 (3 > 2)
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1's best response: A0 (0 < 1) → wait, no!

Wait, correction:
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1: A0 → 0, A1 → 1 → so best response is A1
- So:
  - If Player 2: A0 → P1 wants A1
  - If Player 2: A1 → P1 wants A1

So **A1 is strictly dominant for Player 1**?

Wait, double-check:

- P2 plays A0:
  - P1 chooses A0 → 2
  - P1 chooses A1 → 3 → so better to choose A1
- P2 plays A1:
  - P1 chooses A0 → 0
  - P1 chooses A1 → 1 → still better to choose A1

So **Yes! A1 is strictly dominant for Player 1**.

Similarly, check for Player 2:

- P1 plays A0:
  - P2: A0 → 2, A1 → 3 → so prefers A1
- P1 plays A1:
  - P2: A0 → 0, A1 → 1 → prefers A1

→ So **A1 is also strictly dominant for Player 2**.

### ✅ Conclusion: The unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in payoff (1, 1)

Even though (A0, A0) gives higher rewards, it’s not stable because both players have incentive to deviate unilaterally.

So in the base game, **(A1, A1)** is the outcome.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

A **contract** is a binding side payment mechanism, **if both players agree**.

- If a contract is approved by both, it gets implemented
- The winning contract is **chosen uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**

But since you're only deciding **your approvals**, and the final contract is the one with max approvals (random if tied), you want to approve contracts that:
- You believe will **maximize your expected payoff**
- Are **likely to be selected** (i.e., you want them to have high approval, possibly aligning with others’ incentives)

But you don't know what Player 2 will do — so you must **reason about incentives and likely outcomes**.

You are Player 1.

---

### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

So, **any player choosing A0 gets +1**, paid by the other player.

This means:
- If you play A0, you get +1 (from the other player)
- If you play A1, you get nothing extra

But the +1 is **drawn from the other player**.

So:
- If you play A0, you gain +1 from the opponent
- If you play A1, you get nothing — no cost, no gain

→ So **playing A0 gives you +1 regardless**.

But wait — the contract says: **“drawn equally from the other players”** → so if **you** play A0, **you get +1 from the other player**

Yes, so:

- **Your payoff from action A0** = base payoff + 1
- **Your payoff from action A1** = base payoff + 0

So **A0 is now better by 1 point in every case**.

Let’s recompute your payoffs under this contract.

#### Modified Payoffs for Player 1 under C1:

| P2 | P1 | Base Payoff | +1 if P1 chooses A0 | Final Payoff |
|----|----|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| A0 | A0 | 2           | +1                   | **3**        |
| A0 | A1 | 3           | 0                    | **3**        |
| A1 | A0 | 0           | +1                   | **1**        |
| A1 | A1 | 1           | 0                    | **1**        |

Wait — that’s interesting.

Under C1:
- If you play A0, you get +1 regardless of what the other does
- So your payoff: A0 → base + 1, A1 → base

Thus:
- If P2 plays A0: you get 2+1=3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent
- If P2 plays A1: you get 0+1=1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → **indifferent**

So under C1, **you are indifferent between A0 and A1** regardless of what the other player does.

But now let’s see **what the other player (P2)** faces.

P2 faces:
- If P2 chooses A0: gets +1
- If P2 chooses A1: gets 0

So P2 has incentive to choose A0.

Let’s compute P2’s adjusted payoffs:

| P1 | P2 | Base | +1 if P2 chooses A0 | Final |
|----|----|------|---------------------|-------|
| A0 | A0 | 2    | +1                  | 3     |
| A0 | A1 | 3    | 0                   | 3     |
| A1 | A0 | 0    | +1                  | 1     |
| A1 | A1 | 1    | 0                   | 1     |

Same structure: P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 in every case.

So **both players are indifferent between A0 and A1** under C1.

Thus, any mixture is a best response.

But what is the **equilibrium**?

Since both are indifferent, we need to see what **stable outcomes** might be.

But **critical point**: if both are indifferent, **they might choose A0**, since it gives the +1, and it’s not costly.

But **A0 is not strictly better** — it's just as good as A1, but with +1 bonus.

But **since both are indifferent, the outcome depends on expectations.**

Now, consider: **is (A0, A0) an equilibrium under C1?**

Yes — because if both expect A0, neither wants to deviate:
- Deviating to A1 gives same payoff, so no incentive to deviate.

Similarly, (A1, A1) is also an equilibrium.

So multiple equilibria.

But now, **can we expect (A0, A0) to happen?**

In the contract, **choosing A0 gives you +1**, which is **extra**, so players have **incentive to choose A0**.

But they are indifferent — so unless there’s a convention, it's ambiguous.

But **(A0, A0)** gives both 3 + 1? Wait no — let’s clarify.

Wait: under C1, **if a player chooses A0, they get +1**, but that +1 is **taken from the other player**.

So:
- If both choose A0:
  - P1: base 2 + 1 = 3
  - P2: base 2 + 1 = 3

But the +1 for P1 comes from P2? And the +1 for P2 comes from P1?

That would mean: **each gets +1 from the other** → total cost of 2, but each gains 1 → net effect: **each gets +1**, so total payoff is 2 + 1 = 3 each.

Yes → so (A0, A0) → (3,3)

Now, (A1, A1): base payoffs are 1, and no bonus → so (1,1)

(A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +1 → total: 0 + 1 = 1
P2 plays A1 → gets no bonus → total: 3 → (1,3)

Similarly, (A1, A0): (3,1)

So under C1, **(A0, A0) gives (3,3)**, which is **Pareto superior** and **better than (A1, A1)’s (1,1)**.

And since both players get **+1 for A0**, and **nothing for A1**, they have **incentive to coordinate on A0** if they can.

In fact, **any deviation from A0 is not profitable** — but again, since they’re indifferent, coordination is needed.

But under C1, you **get a fixed +1** for choosing A0, regardless of the other’s action.

So if you **trust** that the other will play A0, playing A0 gives you +1 → total 3 vs 3 → same
But if you think the other will play A1, then:
- A0 gives you 0 + 1 = 1
- A1 gives you 1 → same

So no incentive to deviate.

But **A0 gives you a guaranteed +1 bonus**, so **choosing A0 is safer** — it gives you at least 1, while A1 gives you at most 3 (if P2 plays A0), but only 1 if P2 plays A1.

Wait — no: the payoff is **base** + bonus.

But you don’t know the other’s action.

But from your perspective:

- If you play A0: your payoff is:
  - 2 + 1 = 3 if P2 plays A0
  - 0 + 1 = 1 if P2 plays A1

- If you play A1: your payoff is:
  - 3 if P2 plays A0
  - 1 if P2 plays A1

So your **expected payoff** depends on P2’s strategy.

But suppose P2 plays A0 with probability p.

Then:
- Play A0: 3p + 1(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1
- Play A1: 3p + 1(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1

Same! So **you are indifferent**

Same for P2.

So again, indifference.

But **both players get higher payoff if they play A0 together**.

So **(A0, A0)** is a better outcome than (A1, A1) — and **(A0,A0)** yields (3,3) vs (1,1)

So **C1 is good** for your expected payoff **if coordination on (A0, A0) is achieved**

But is it likely?

Since **both players have no downside to choosing A0** (they get at least 1, and sometimes 3), and **they get a bonus**, while choosing A1 gives no bonus, **there is a coordination incentive toward A0**

Moreover, **you proposed C1**, so you might be more inclined to support it.

But let’s compare to C2.

---

### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- A0 → +1 (from opponent)
- A1 → -1 (to opponent)

This is a **stronger incentive to choose A0**, and **punishes A1**.

Let’s compute the new payoffs under C2.

#### Your (Player 1) payoffs under C2:

| P2 | P1 | Base | Bonus | Final Payoff |
|----|----|------|--------|--------------|
| A0 | A0 | 2    | +1     | **3**        |
| A0 | A1 | 3    | -1     | **2**        |
| A1 | A0 | 0    | +1     | **1**        |
| A1 | A1 | 1    | -1     | **0**        |

So:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1: A0 → 3, A1 → 2 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 0 → prefers A0

So **A0 is strictly dominant** for you under C2! ✅

Similarly, check Player 2’s payoffs:

| P1 | P2 | Base | Bonus | Final |
|----|----|------|--------|-------|
| A0 | A0 | 2    | +1     | 3     |
| A0 | A1 | 3    | -1     | 2     |
| A1 | A0 | 0    | +1     | 1     |
| A1 | A1 | 1    | -1     | 0     |

Same structure: P2 also strictly prefers A0 in every case.

So under C2:
- **A0 is strictly dominant for both players**
- So **(A0, A0)** is the unique equilibrium
- Payoff: **(3,3)**

This is **Pareto superior** to the base game outcome (1,1), and **better than C1’s (3,3)**, but **identical** in this case.

Wait — is it better?

In C1: (A0, A0) gives (3,3) — same as C2.

But in C2, **A0 is strictly dominant**, so **coordination is guaranteed**. No ambiguity.

In C1, both players are indifferent — so they might still end up at (A1, A1) — but under C2, they **cannot** play A1 — it's dominated.

So under C2, **you are guaranteed to get (3,3)**.

Under C1, you might get (3,3), or (1,1), or (1,3), but only if both coordinate on A0.

But **only if they both believe the other will play A0**.

But under C1, since you are indifferent, there’s no strong incentive to coordinate — unless there’s a focal point.

But **under C2, A0 is strictly better in every case**.

So **C2 leads to (3,3) with certainty**.

Under C1, the outcome depends on coordination — **could be worse**.

So **C2 is strictly better for you**.

But wait — what about the **cost of approval**?

You are deciding whether to approve the contracts.

You want to **maximize your final expected payoff**, and the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve **C2**, and Player 2 also approves C2, then C2 will be selected (since it’s the only one with 2 approvals, if you approve both).

But if you **don’t approve C2**, but approve C1, and Player 2 approves C1, then C1 is selected.

But if both approve both, then both have 2 approvals each → so one is selected at random.

But since **C2 gives you a better guaranteed outcome (3,3)** than C1 (which is uncertain), you **prefer C2 over C1**.

But **Player 2 proposed C2**, so they **will approve it** (because it benefits them — same as you).

So Player 2: likely to approve C2.

But will they approve C1? Possibly not — but it’s a zero-sum view.

Let’s analyze: does Player 2 **prefer C2 over C1?**

Under C1:
- A0 gives +1 to each player
- A1 gives 0
- So A0 is equally good → indifferent
- So (A0, A0) gives 3 each → good
- But (A1, A1) gives 1 each — bad

But **Player 2 has no incentive to punish A1 in C1**, so might end up at (A1, A1) if player 1 plays A1.

But under C2:
- A1 gives -1 → so **A1 is strictly worse**
- So A0 is dominant → (A0, A0) is guaranteed

So **C2 is better for Player 2** too.

Thus, **Player 2 will prefer C2 over C1** — so they will **approve C2**, and **likely disapprove C1**.

Similarly, you should:

- Approve C2 → because it guarantees (3,3), and is better than C1
- Approve C1? It’s worse — because under C1, you might get (1,1) or other outcomes due to coordination failure

But **C1 is less reliable**.

Moreover, under C1, since both players are indifferent, there is **no incentive to play A0** — only a symmetric benefit.

But **C2 provides a clear incentive structure**.

So you **should not approve C1** — because:
- It’s inferior to C2
- It’s less likely to lead to good outcomes
- You can get a better outcome via C2

But wait — **can the contracts actually be simultaneously approved?** Yes.

But **you want the contract that maximizes your expected payoff.**

So you should approve **only C2**, because:
- It leads to **guaranteed (3,3)** under any rational play
- C1 leads to **uncertain outcomes**, possibly (1,1)
- So C2 is better

But what if **Player 2 does not approve C2**?

But they are **self-interested**, and C2 is better for them too.

So they **will** approve C2.

Now, what about C1?

Player 2 proposed C1 — but C1 is worse for them than C2.

So they **won’t approve C1** if they can approve C2.

But in the approval process, **a player can approve multiple contracts**.

But if two players both approve C2, then C2 is the **only one with 2 approvals**, so it wins.

If you approve C1 and C2, and Player 2 only approves C2, then C2 wins.

So **you are better off only approving C2**.

But wait: what if **you approve only C1**, and Player 2 approves C2?

Then:
- C1 has 1 approval (yours)
- C2 has 1 approval (Player 2’s)
- So max approvals = 1 → so **winning contract chosen uniformly at random from C1 and C2**

Then you get:
- 50% chance of C1 → outcome (A0,A0) with payoff (3,3)? But only if coordination happens.
- But under C1, outcomes are uncertain.

Under C1: you are indifferent → so could be (A0,A0), (A1,A1), etc.

But if both players are indifferent, **what outcome occurs?**

Without a focal point, **they might play (A1, A1)** — the default outcome.

But C2 forces (A0,A0) → so **C2 gives (3,3) with certainty**

C1 gives **(3,3) only if both coordinate**, which may not happen.

So **C1 is risky, C2 is safe**

So if **C1 and C2 are both approved**, and one is picked at random, then **50% chance of (3,3), 50% chance of (1,1)** → **expected payoff: 2**

But if **you only approve C2**, and Player 2 approves C2 → then **C2 is selected for sure** → **you get 3**

That’s better than 2.

If you approve **only C1**, and Player 2 approves **only C2**, then **both contracts have 1 approval**, so one is picked at random → 50% chance of C1 → 50% chance of C2 → same 50% of 3, 50% of 1 → expected 2

Same as above.

But if you approve **C2 only**, and Player 2 approves**C2**, then you get **C2 for sure** → payoff **3**

So **better**.

Now, suppose **you approve only C1**, and Player 2 approves **C1**:

Then C1 wins → but under C1, outcome is **uncertain**

What is the **expected payoff** under C1?

Since both players are indifferent, **in Nash equilibrium**, **any mixture** is allowed.

But the most **reasonable equilibrium** might be (A1, A1), the **default**, or (A0, A0) as a focal point.

But in the absence of coordination, **(A1, A1)** is a Nash equilibrium, and both get 1.

But (A0, A0) is also an equilibrium.

But **there is no strict incentive to coordinate on A0** — only a symmetric bonus.

So **(A0, A0)** might not occur with high probability.

Thus, under C1, **you might get only 1**, or 3.

But **if both players are rational and expect coordination, they might play A0**.

But **no guarantee**.

So **expected payoff under C1 is somewhere between 1 and 3**, but not certain.

But **under C2, it is certain 3**.

So **C2 is strictly better**.

Moreover, **if you approve only C2**, and Player 2 approves C2, you get 3.

If you approve both, and Player 2 approves both, then one is picked at random → expected payoff: (3 + E[C1])/2

But E[C1] < 3 → so **expected payoff < 3**

So **you are worse off**.

Thus, **you should only approve C2**

But what if Player 2 does **not** approve C2?

Then you cannot get C2.

But **C2 is better for Player 2 too**, so they will approve it.

They have **no reason not to**.

So **Player 2 will approve C2**

Thus, if you approve **C2**, and Player 2 approves **C2**, then C2 wins with probability 1.

If you approve only C1, you might get a risky outcome.

Thus, **your best strategy is to approve C2 only**

But what about C1?

You **don’t want to approve C1** because:
- It’s worse than C2
- If both are approved, there’s a risk of getting C1
- But if you approve C1, and C2 is still chosen, you get C2 anyway — so **you don’t lose** — but you **increase the chance of C1 being selected** if both approve both.

But **you don’t want C1 to be selected**, because it’s riskier.

So **you should never approve C1 if C2 exists and is better**.

But **if you approve C1**, and C2 is not approved, then you get C1.

But if C2 is approved (which it will be), and you approve both, then the winning contract is random between C1 and C2 → you have **50% chance of getting C1**, which is worse than C2.

So **you should only approve C2**.

Therefore:

- **Approve C2: YES**
- **Approve C1: NO**

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

- **C1 (Proposed by P1):** Do **not approve** — it’s inferior and risky compared to C2
- **C2 (Proposed by P2):** **Approve** — it guarantees (3,3), and is better for both players

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

response:
To maximize points in this Prisoner's Dilemma game, let's analyze the payoffs for the original game and the proposed contracts.

**1. Original Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)
Action A1 is strictly dominant for both players, leading to the Nash Equilibrium of (1, 1).

**2. Contract 1 (C1):**
Player choosing A0 gets +1 and the other player gets -1.
- (A0, A0): (2+1-1, 2+1-1) = (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0+1, 3-1) = (1, 2)
- (A1, A0): (3-1, 0+1) = (2, 1)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)
Under C1, both players are indifferent between A0 and A1 regardless of the other's choice. Both actions give the same payoff to the person choosing them, but choosing A0 helps the other player.

**3. Contract 2 (C2):**
Player choosing A0 gets +2 and the other player gets -2.
- (A0, A0): (2+2-2, 2+2-2) = (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1)
- (A1, A0): (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2)
- (A1, A1): (1, 1)
Under C2, A0 becomes the strictly dominant strategy for both players. This ensures both will choose A0, resulting in the maximum possible steady payoff of 2 points each.

**Decision Strategy:**
- Both C1 and C2 are better than the original game's equilibrium (1, 1).
- C2 is superior to C1 because it makes the mutually beneficial action (A0) a strictly dominant strategy, whereas C1 only makes it a weak/indifferent choice.
- To maximize the probability of C2 winning the approval vote, you should approve C2 and not approve C1. If you approve both and the other player only approves C1, C1 will win. By approving only C2, you either ensure C2 wins or force a tie between C1 and C2 (if the other player only approves C1), which is better than C1 winning outright.

Since you are Player 2 and your objective is to maximize your total points, approving only the contract that guarantees the best stable outcome (C2) is the optimal move.

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

Let's go through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

This is a classic 2-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|                | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

This is a **coordination game with a conflict of interest**, similar to a "battle of the sexes" but asymmetric.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria.

#### **Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria**:
- (A0, A0): If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 2 (vs 3 if switching to A1). So Player 2 won’t deviate.  
  If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 2 (vs 3 if switching to A1). So Player 1 won’t deviate.  
  → **Nash equilibrium**
- (A1, A1): If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 gets 1 (vs 0 if switching to A0). No incentive to deviate.  
  If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 1 (vs 0 if switching to A0). No incentive.  
  → **Nash equilibrium**

So two pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

#### **Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium?**
We can compute it, but for now, note:
- (A0,A0) gives both players 2 → good coordination.
- (A1,A1) gives both 1 → worse for both.
So rational players might prefer (A0,A0), but Player 1 has incentive to deviate to A1 if Player 2 plays A0 (gets 3 instead of 2).  
Player 2 has incentive to deviate to A1 if Player 1 plays A0 (gets 3 instead of 2).

So both have incentive to "sabotage" coordination unless they can **coordinate**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

A **contract** can be proposed (C1 by Player 1, C2 by Player 2) and must be approved by players.

- If a contract is **approved by both**, it takes effect.
- The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals** (i.e., the most approvals — could be 2, 1, or 0).

Our goal: **Maximize our expected points**.

We are **Player 1**, and we must decide whether to **approve** C1 and/or C2.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Contracts**

Each contract adds **additional payments** based on the action chosen.

> Important: "additional payment" is drawn **equally from the other player**.

So if a player chooses A0 under a contract, they receive +1 (or +2) **from the other player** — so the other player loses that amount.

But **this is only applied if the contract is in effect**.

Let’s define the **total payoff** under each contract as the **base payoff + contract payment**.

---

### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**  
- If a player chooses A0 → +1 point to themselves, −1 from other player  
- No additional payment for A1

So under C1, the **updated payoffs** are:

|                | P2: A0       | P2: A1       |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0**     | (2+1, 2−1) = (3,1) | (0−1, 3+1) = (−1,4) |
| **P1: A1**     | (3−1, 0+1) = (2,1) | (1,1)        |

Wait — careful: when P1 plays A0, P1 gets +1, P2 pays −1.  
When P2 plays A0, P2 gets +1, P1 pays −1.

So the **joint action** A0 vs A0 → P1 gets +1, P2 gets −1 from the contract.

So yes:

- (A0,A0): P1: 2 + 1 = 3, P2: 2 − 1 = 1
- (A0,A1): P1: 0 −1 = −1 (since P1 played A0 → P1 gets +1, but P2 played A1 → P2 pays nothing to P1, but P1 pays −1 to P2 via the contract for choosing A0? Wait — no.

Hold on: **Clarify contract interpretation**

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:  
- When **you** choose A0 → you get +1  
- This +1 comes **from the other player** → so other player loses 1

So if **you** choose A0, you gain +1, the **other** player loses 1.

So **regardless of other player's action**, if **you** choose A0, you get +1, and the **other** loses 1.

But only **if that contract is in force**.

So **contract adds a fixed transfer** whenever you choose A0: +1 to you, −1 to the other.

Similarly, if you choose A1 → no transfer.

So under **C1**, the **total payoff matrix is**:

|                | P2: A0       | P2: A1       |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0**     | (2+1, 2−1) = (3,1) | (0−1, 3+1) = (−1,4) |
| **P1: A1**     | (3−1, 0+1) = (2,1) | (1,1)        |

Wait — that can’t be right.

Let’s re-analyze carefully:

- When **P1 chooses A0** → P1 gets +1, P2 loses 1 → so P1: +1, P2: −1
- When **P2 chooses A0** → P2 gets +1, P1 loses 1 → so P2: +1, P1: −1

So **both** actions trigger the transfer **independently**.

But when both choose A0:  
- P1 gets +1 (because P1 chose A0)  
- P2 gets +1 (because P2 chose A0)  
→ So **P1 gets +1, P2 gets +1?**

Wait — no! The contract says:
> "additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players"

So if **player X** chooses A0, they receive +1 **from the other player**.

So in (A0,A0):
- P1 gets +1 (from P2)
- P2 gets +1 (from P1)

→ Both get +1 from contract

So **P1 total payoff**: base 2 + 1 = 3  
**P2 total payoff**: base 2 + 1 = 3

But wait: P1 gives +1 to P2, P2 gives +1 to P1 → so total net change: 0.

Yes — so both get +1.

Similarly:
- (A0,A1): P1 chose A0 → gets +1 from P2 → P1: 0 +1 = 1  
  P2 chose A1 → gets no payment → but P2 pays +1 to P1 (since P1 chose A0)  
  So P2: 3 − 1 = 2  
  Wait — that’s a problem.

No: the contract pays **to** the player who chooses A0, **from** the other player.

So in (A0,A1):
- P1 chose A0 → gets +1 from P2 → so P1 gets +1
- P2 chose A1 → no payment to anyone, but must pay to P1 (because P1 chose A0 and is entitled) → so P2 loses 1

So:
- P1: base 0 + 1 = 1
- P2: base 3 − 1 = 2

Wait — but that seems inconsistent.

Let’s formalize:

For a given game outcome:
- Each player who chose A0 gets +1 from the other player (if the contract is active)
- So if **P1 chose A0**, P1 gets +1 from P2, P2 loses 1
- If **P2 chose A0**, P2 gets +1 from P1, P1 loses 1

So in (A0,A1):
- P1 chose A0 → P1 gets +1 from P2
- P2 chose A1 → P2 gives nothing, receives nothing
→ So P1: 0 +1 = 1  
→ P2: 3 −1 = 2

In (A1,A0):
- P1 chose A1 → gets nothing, pays nothing
- P2 chose A0 → gets +1 from P1
→ P1: 3 −1 = 2  
→ P2: 0 +1 = 1

In (A0,A0):
- Both chose A0 → P1 gets +1 from P2, P2 gets +1 from P1
→ P1: 2 +1 = 3  
→ P2: 2 +1 = 3

In (A1,A1):
- Neither chose A0 → no transfers
→ P1: 1, P2: 1

Therefore, under **C1**, the **payoff matrix** is:

|                | P2: A0       | P2: A1       |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0**     | (3,3)        | (1,2)        |
| **P1: A1**     | (2,1)        | (1,1)        |

Now, under **C2** (Player 2’s proposal):

- If a player chooses A0, they get +2 from the other player
- If A1, no transfer

So similar logic:

In (A0,A0):
- P1 gets +2 from P2
- P2 gets +2 from P1
→ P1: 2 +2 = 4  
→ P2: 2 +2 = 4

In (A0,A1):
- P1 chose A0 → gets +2 from P2
- P2 chose A1 → gives +2 to P1
→ P1: 0 +2 = 2  
→ P2: 3 −2 = 1

In (A1,A0):
- P1 chose A1 → gets nothing
- P2 chose A0 → gets +2 from P1
→ P1: 3 −2 = 1  
→ P2: 0 +2 = 2

In (A1,A1): no change → (1,1)

So **C2 payoff matrix**:

|                | P2: A0       | P2: A1       |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0**     | (4,4)        | (2,1)        |
| **P1: A1**     | (1,2)        | (1,1)        |

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate Each Contract from Player 1’s Perspective**

Our goal: Maximize **our own** expected points.

But the contract only takes effect **if approved by both players** (or at least, if it’s part of the winning set), but importantly: **the winning contract is selected at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So outcomes depend on **approval patterns**.

Let’s consider the **approval outcomes**:

- C1 approved by P1 and P2 → both approve → both have approval of 2 → C1 wins (randomly selected among max-approved contracts)
- C2 approved by both → both approve → max approval is 2 → C2 wins
- C1 approved by P1 only → approval count: 1 → C2 must also have ≤ 1 for C1 to be considered
- Similarly for C2 only
- If neither, no contract → base game

But since contracts are selected uniformly at random **from those with maximum number of approvals**, the outcome depends on which contracts are approved.

We must **choose** whether to approve C1 and/or C2, to **maximize our expected payoff**.

We are **Player 1**, so we choose our approvals.

Let’s consider the **four cases** based on what we approve (C1 and/or C2) and how P2 reacts.

But we don’t know P2’s approval — we must **strategically** decide.

So let’s think about **what P2 would do**, and how we should react.

But note: we are only deciding our own approvals. P2 is the other player. So P2’s approval choice is **unknown** and potentially adversarial or self-interested.

We must **anticipate** P2’s behavior.

---

### **Step 5: Predict P2’s Behavior (Rational Player 2)**

We are Player 1. We are choosing approvals. Player 2 will also choose approvals.

Player 2 is rational and wants to **maximize their own payoff**.

So we must **predict what C1 and C2 mean for Player 2**.

Let’s evaluate each contract from **P2’s perspective**.

---

#### **C1 (Proposed by P1)** — Payoff matrix (P1, P2):

| P2\A1 | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| A0    | (3,3)   | (1,2)   |
| A1    | (2,1)   | (1,1)   |

Let’s find **best responses** for P2.

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 chooses A0: gets 3
  - P2 chooses A1: gets 2
  → P2 prefers A0

- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 chooses A0: gets 1
  - P2 chooses A1: gets 1
  → indifferent

So P2’s best response is:
- A0 if P1 plays A0
- A0 or A1 if P1 plays A1

Now, if the game is played with **mixed strategies** under C1, we can compute equilibrium.

But notice: in **C1**, (A0,A0) is a strong equilibrium:
- P1: 3 (vs 2 if deviates to A1)
- P2: 3 (vs 2 if deviates)

In fact, (A0,A0) gives both 3 → **strict best** for both.

So P2 **clearly likes C1** — it makes (A0,A0) payoff 3,3, and makes A1 less attractive for P2 (since if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 1 no matter what).

In fact, P2 has **incentive to play A0** and avoid A1 if P1 plays A0 — which they will.

So **C1 is very favorable for P2**.

In fact, it **aligns incentives perfectly**: both want to coordinate on (A0,A0), which gives 3,3.

So **Player 2 will approve C1**, because:
- It increases their payoff in coordination
- It deters unilateral moves to A1
- It gives them a guaranteed 3 in the best outcome

So **P2 approves C1**

---

#### **C2 (Proposed by P2)** — Payoff matrix:

| P2\A1 | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| A0    | (4,4)   | (2,1)   |
| A1    | (1,2)   | (1,1)   |

Now look from **P2's perspective**.

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 plays A0 → 4
  - P2 plays A1 → 1
  → prefers A0

- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 plays A0 → 2
  - P2 plays A1 → 1
  → prefers A0

So **P2’s best response is A0 always** — regardless of P1.

Now, what does P1 want?

P1:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 plays A0 → 4
  - P1 plays A1 → 1
  → prefers A0

So (A0,A0) is the only Nash equilibrium: (4,4)

So under C2, both players have **incentive to play A0**, and (A0,A0) is the best outcome (4,4)

So **C2 is also very good for P2**, giving them 4 in coordination.

P2 proposed it, so clearly wants it.

So **P2 approves C2** — it gives them 4 in the best case, and they can enforce A0.

Even better: since P2 **always** wants to play A0 regardless of P1, and P1 also wants to play A0 if P2 plays A0, they can coordinate on (A0,A0).

So **P2 will approve both C1 and C2**? Possibly.

But let’s compare:

- C1: (A0,A0) gives (3,3)
- C2: (A0,A0) gives (4,4)

So **C2 is better for P2** → so if P2 must choose, they prefer C2.

But they might approve both.

But here's the catch: **only one contract is selected** (randomly from those with maximum approvals).

So if **both are approved**, then **both have 2 approvals** → so **randomly chosen between C1 and C2**.

So P2 will get:
- With 50% chance: C1 → payoff 3 (in (A0,A0))
- With 50% chance: C2 → payoff 4

→ Expected payoff: (3+4)/2 = **3.5**

But if P2 **only approves C2**, then C2 has 2 approvals (P1 and P2), so it wins → payoff 4

→ Better than 3.5

So **P2 will prefer to approve only C2**, so they get **guaranteed 4**, not 3.5 on average.

Even if they approve C1, they get less expected payoff because of risk.

Therefore, **P2 will NOT approve C1** — because it reduces their expected payoff.

But wait: if we (P1) **only approve C1**, then:
- C1 has 1 approval (mine)
- C2 has 1 approval (if P2 approves C2) → both have 1 → **random** between C1 and C2
→ P2 gets 3.5 again

Same as above.

But if **P2 approves only C2**, and we approve nothing:
- C2 has 1 approval → max approval is 1
- C1 has 0 → so C2 wins
→ P2 gets 4

If we approve nothing, and P2 approves only C2 → C2 wins → P2 gets 4

If we approve C1, P2 approves C2 → both have 1 approval → C2 is selected 50% of the time → P2 gets 3.5 → worse

So P2 **will not approve C1**, because approving C1 reduces their expected payoff.

Therefore, **Player 2 will approve only C2**, and **not approve C1**.

---

### **Step 6: What Should We (Player 1) Do?**

We now know:
- P2 will approve **only C2**
- P2 will **not approve C1**

So approval outcomes:

| We approve C1 | We approve C2 | Max approval count | Winning contract |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| No            | No            | 0 (no contract)     | Base game        |
| Yes           | No            | 1 (only C1)         | C1 (only one)    |
| No            | Yes           | 2 (C2 only)         | C2 (only one)    |
| Yes           | Yes           | 2 (C1 & C2) → random | C1 or C2 (50%/50%) |

Now let’s compute **our expected payoff** under each of our choices.

We are **Player 1**.

Let’s go through each case:

---

#### **Option 1: Approve neither C1 nor C2**

- No contract → base game
- Payoff matrix:
  | P2\A1 | A0 | A1 |
  |-------|----|----|
  | A0    | 2,2| 0,3|
  | A1    | 3,0| 1,1|

Assume **rational best responses**.

Possible equilibria:
- (A0,A0): (2,2)
- (A1,A1): (1,1)

But P1 prefers (A1,A0): gets 3
P2 prefers (A0,A1): gets 3

So there is a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s compute it.

Let P1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)

P2 play A0 with q, A1 with (1−q)

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 2p + 3(1−p) = 3 − p
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0p + 1(1−p) = 1 − p

P1 is indifferent when:
3 − p = 1 − p → 3 = 1 → impossible

Wait — no, for P2’s best response to P1.

Wait — better: compute P2’s indifference.

P2’s expected payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: 2p + 0(1−p) = 2p
- If P2 plays A1: 3p + 1(1−p) = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1

P2 indifferent when:
2p = 2p + 1 → 0=1 → impossible

So P2 never indifferent.

P2 always plays A1 if 2p + 1 > 2p → always true → P2 **prefers A1** no matter what P1 does?

Wait:
- If P1 plays A0 (p=1), then:
  - P2: A0 → 2, A1 → 3 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1 (p=0), then:
  - P2: A0 → 0, A1 → 1 → prefers A1

So **P2 always strictly prefers A1**, regardless of P1.

Then P1 knows this → P1 plays:
- A0 → gets 0
- A1 → gets 1

So P1 plays A1 → outcome (A1,A1) → both get 1

So **equilibrium: (A1,A1)** → P1 gets **1**

So in base game, **P1 gets 1** (worst possible if coordinated)

So **outcome: (A1,A1) with payoff 1 for P1**

So **Expected payoff = 1**

---

#### **Option 2: Approve C1 only (not C2)**

- P1 approves C1
- P2 **will not approve C1** (as we deduced), so C1 has only 1 approval
- C2 has 1 approval (P2's), so both have 1 → **random win between C1 and C2**

So with 50% chance: C1 in effect → P1 gets expected payoff under C1
With 50% chance: C2 in effect → P1 gets expected payoff under C2

So **P1’s expected payoff = 0.5 × E_C1 + 0.5 × E_C2**

Now compute **equilibrium under C1** (we already have the matrix):

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (3,3) | (1,2) |
| **P1: A1** | (2,1) | (1,1) |

Now find equilibrium.

P2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

P1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

So P1 always prefers A0 if P2 plays A0

P2 always prefers A0 if P1 plays A0

So **(A0,A0)** is strict Nash → both play A0

Outcome: (3,3)

So under C1: P1 gets **3**

Under C2:
- As above: (A0,A0) is strict Nash → payoff (4,4)
- P1 gets **4**

So under this option:
- 50% chance C1 → P1 gets 3
- 50% chance C2 → P1 gets 4
→ Expected payoff: **(3+4)/2 = 3.5**

---

#### **Option 3: Approve C2 only (not C1)**

- P1 approves C2
- P2 approves C2 → so C2 has 2 approvals
- C1 has 0 (we didn’t approve) → so C2 wins (only one with 2 approvals)

So C2 is enforced → payoff matrix:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (4,4) | (2,1) |
| **P1: A1** | (1,2) | (1,1) |

As before: P1 wants A0 if P2 plays A0; P2 wants A0 regardless.

So (A0,A0) → (4,4) is the equilibrium.

P1 gets **4**

So **expected payoff: 4**

Better than 3.5

---

#### **Option 4: Approve both C1 and C2**

- C1: approved by P1 only → 1 approval
- C2: approved by P1 and P2 → 2 approvals → maximum
→ So **only C2 wins** → C2 enforced

So outcome: same as Option 3 → P1 gets **4**

So **expected payoff = 4**

But now: **we approved both**, so we paid a "cost" of having to approve C1? But no — approval is free, nothing in exchange.

So it’s just a choice.

But outcome is same as approving only C2.

So **same payoff: 4**

But we didn’t gain anything by approving both — **we still get 4**

But now, **what if we approve both, but P2 is forced to do something else?** No — P2 is rational and will still only approve C2, as we predicted.

So outcome is same.

But in **Option 3**, we approved only C2 → got 4

In **Option 4**, we approved both → still get 4

So **no difference in payoff**

But is there any risk?

Wait — if we approve both, then **both C1 and C2 have at least 1 approval**, C2 has 2, so C2 still wins.

So **no difference**.

So **we are indifferent between approving only C2 and approving both**.

But we can choose.

But let’s see: is there any downside?

No.

But perhaps **approving both is unnecessary** — but it doesn’t hurt.

However, **we want to maximize our payoff**, and both give 4.

But in **Option 2**, we get 3.5 → worse.

So **best is to approve C2**.

But should we approve C1?

Only if it increases our payoff.

But in all cases where C2 is active (which it is unless we don’t approve it), we get 4.

But if we **only** approve C1, we get 3.5 → worse.

So **we should not approve C1**

But what if P2 changes their mind?

No — we modeled that P2 is rational and will **only** approve C2 because it’s better.

So unless P2 is irrational, they won’t approve C1.

So we can **safely assume** P2 approves only C2.

Therefore:

- If we approve only C2 → get 4
- If we approve C1 and C2 → still get 4
- If we approve only C1 → get 3.5
- If we approve nothing → get 1

So **optimal to approve C2**

But **should we approve C1?**

Only if it helps us. But it **doesn’t** — and may **hurt** if P2 is not sure.

But we predicted P2 will not approve C1.

But suppose for some reason P2 **does** approve C1.

Then both C1 and C2 have at least 1 approval.

But **C2 has 2** (if we approve it), so still wins.

So we **still get 4**

So **approving C1 doesn’t hurt** — but doesn't help.

So we might as well approve C1, but only if it doesn't reduce payoff.

But it doesn’t.

But is there a **reason not** to?

No — **approval is free**, and we get at least as much.

But **in all cases**, if we approve C2 (which we should), then C2 is selected (unless no one else approves it, but P2 will).

So **approval of C1 is irrelevant** if we approve C2.

But **if we don’t approve C2**, then C2 has only 1 approval (from P2), and if we approve C1, then C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → random → we get 3.5 → worse.

So **only way to get 4 is to approve C2**

So we **must** approve C2.

Now, should we approve C1?

- If we approve C1 **and** C2 → C2 wins → we get 4
- If we approve C2 only → C2 wins → we get 4

Same outcome.

But if we don’t approve C1, we still get 4.

No downside.

But is there **any benefit** to approving C1?

No — because it won’t change outcome.

So we can **choose not to approve C1** — it’s unnecessary.

But since it doesn’t hurt, is it acceptable?

But the question is to **maximize our total points**.

So as long as we get 4, we’re fine.

But if we approve C1, and P2 changes their mind and approves C1 for some reason, it doesn’t hurt.

But since P2 is rational, they won’t.

So **safe to approve C2, not C1**

But in **Option 4**, we approve both → still 4

But in Option 3, we only approve C2 → still 4

So both are **equally good**

But since we are trying to maximize, and both give same payoff, we can **choose either**.

But **should we approve C1?**

Only if it increases the chance of C2 winning — but no, C2 wins anyway if we approve it.

So **no benefit**.

And **no risk**.

So **we can approve both**.

But **why would we?** It’s not necessary.

But since **the payoff is the same**, and we are asked to **decide** whether to approve, we must pick.

But the key is: **if we approve both, then C2 wins anyway**, so we're fine.

But if we **only approve C2**, it also wins.

So both choices are **equally good**.

But now consider: **if we approve both, then C2 has 2 approvals, so it wins**.

If we approve only C2, **C2 still wins**.

So **same outcome**.

But can we **guarantee** getting 4?

Yes, **only if we approve C2**.

Now, what if we **don’t approve C2**?

Then:
- C2 has only 1 approval (P2’s)
- If we approve C1 → both have 1 → random → expected 3.5 < 4

So worse.

So **must approve C2**.

Now — should we approve C1?

- If we approve C1 and not C2 → worse
- If we approve C1 and C2 → same as only C2
- So best to **approve C2**, and **not approve C1**

But is there any **reason to approve C1**?

Only if we think P2 might not approve C2 — but we modeled they will.

So **no**

Moreover, approving C1 might **confuse** or **signal** something, but no — it’s just a binary choice.

So **optimal to approve only C2**

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the base game without contract

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:

|           | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0 | 2              | 0              |
| I play A1 | 3              | 1              |

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma where:
- If other plays A0: A1 gives me 3 > 2, so A1 is better
- If other plays A1: A1 gives me 1 > 0, so A1 is better

**A1 is my dominant strategy.**

By symmetry, A1 is also the dominant strategy for Player 1.

**Nash equilibrium without contract: Both play A1, getting (1, 1)**

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract adds:
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points to the other player
- If a player chooses A0, no payment

### Step 3: Calculate payoffs with contract

Modified payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

|           | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0 | (2, 2)         | (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2) |
| I play A1 | (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1) | (1-2+2, 1-2+2) = (1, 1) |

Wait, let me recalculate more carefully:
- (A0, A0): Base (2,2), no penalties → **(2, 2)**
- (A1, A0): Base (3,0), P1 pays 2 to P2 → **(1, 2)**
- (A0, A1): Base (0,3), P2 pays 2 to P1 → **(2, 1)**
- (A1, A1): Base (1,1), both pay 2 (cancel out) → **(1, 1)**

### Step 4: Analyze with contract

From my perspective (Player 2):
- If other plays A0: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: I get 2 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy with the contract!**

By symmetry, A0 also becomes dominant for Player 1.

**Nash equilibrium with contract: Both play A0, getting (2, 2)**

### Step 5: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** I get 1 point
- **With contract:** I get 2 points

The contract effectively penalizes the defection strategy (A1), making cooperation (A0) the dominant choice. This solves the Prisoner's Dilemma and doubles my payoff.

### Conclusion

I should sign the contract.

{"sign": true}

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal strategy for **Player 2** (you), under the modified payoff structure due to the **payment contract**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

The base game is a classic coordination game with a twist:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-----------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                      | 2, 2     | 0, 3     |
| **A1**                      | 3, 0     | 1, 1     |

This is similar to a **battle of the sexes** or **coordination game** with a conflict.

If you play A0 and opponent plays A0: you get 2  
If you play A0 and opponent plays A1: you get 0  
If you play A1 and opponent plays A0: you get 3  
If you play A1 and opponent plays A1: you get 1  

So, you prefer A1 when opponent plays A0, and A0 when opponent plays A1 (since 2 > 1). But mutual A0 gives 2, mutual A1 gives 1, so you'd prefer coordination on A0 if possible.

But crucially, **A1 dominates A0** when the opponent plays A0, and **A0 dominates A1** when the opponent plays A1. This creates two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1), and a mixed equilibrium in between.

But now the **contract** modifies the payoffs.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Payment Contract**

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+1 point**, **drawn equally from the other players**.  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay **-1 point**, **distributed equally among the other players**.

Since **only two players**, the "others" means the **single opponent**.

So:
- If you choose A0 → you get +1, and your opponent loses 1 (since the 1 is drawn from them).
- If you choose A1 → you pay -1, so you lose 1, and your opponent gains 1.

This is a **transfer mechanism**: choosing A0 gives you +1 at opponent’s expense; choosing A1 costs you 1 but gives opponent +1.

So the **net effect** is that choosing A0 transfers +1 from opponent to you; choosing A1 transfers +1 from you to opponent.

Important: This transfer happens **regardless** of the outcome — it's **independent** of the base payoff. It's an additional layer.

---

### **Step 3: Combine Base Payoffs with Contract Effects**

Let’s compute your **total expected payoff** for each combination.

Let’s define:
- Your action: A0 or A1
- Opponent’s action: A0 or A1

#### Case 1: You choose A0, Opponent chooses A0
- Base: you get 2
- Contract: you choose A0 → +1
- Opponent chooses A0 → no cost to them? Wait: no.
  - The contract says: **if you choose A0**, you get +1 from the other.
  - So both players get affected based on *their own* choice.

So the contract applies **per player**, based on their action.

So:
- You: A0 → +1
- Opponent: A0 → +1
- Base: 2

→ Your total: 2 + 1 = **3**  
→ Opponent’s total: 2 + 1 = 3

Wait — this can’t be right. The contract says "drawn equally from the other players" — but if both choose A0, then each gains 1, so both get +1 — but who pays?

Let’s re-read:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you** choose A0, you get +1, **taken from the other players**.

Similarly, if **you** choose A1, you pay -1, distributed among other players.

So:
- If you choose A0 → you gain +1, and the opponent must pay the 1 (since you're pulling it from them).
- If you choose A1 → you pay -1, so opponent gains +1.

Same for the opponent.

So the transfer is **one-way**, based on your action.

But now the problem is: **what if both choose A0?**

Then:
- You choose A0 → you get +1 → opponent pays you 1
- Opponent chooses A0 → opponent gets +1 → you pay opponent 1

So **net effect**: you gain 1, lose 1 → net 0 from contract.

Similarly, if both choose A1:
- You choose A1 → you pay -1 → opponent gains +1
- Opponent chooses A1 → opponent pays -1 → you gain +1

So again: net 0.

But if you choose A0 and opponent chooses A1:
- You: A0 → +1 from opponent
- Opponent: A1 → pays -1 to you (so you get +1 extra)

Wait — that would be **you receive +1 from contract** (because you chose A0), and **opponent is paying -1**, so you receive +1 from that too?

No — let's clarify.

**Key Insight**: The transfer applies **per player**, and the **cost is drawn from the other players**.

But in a 2-player game, "drawn equally from the other players" means **the entire 1 point comes from the other player** (since only one other player).

So:
- If you choose A0: you receive +1, and your opponent loses 1 (due to you pulling it from them).
- If you choose A1: you lose 1, and your opponent gains 1.

Similarly for opponent.

Now, consider outcomes:

---

#### Let's compute your **total** payoff (base + contract) for each possible action pair.

---

**Case 1: You A0, Opponent A0**
- Base: 2
- Contract: you choose A0 → +1
- Opponent chooses A0 → so opponent gets +1 → you must pay them 1
- Net contract: +1 -1 = 0
- Total: 2 + 0 = **2**

**Case 2: You A0, Opponent A1**
- Base: 0
- Contract: you choose A0 → +1
- Opponent chooses A1 → opponent pays -1 → so you gain +1 from that
- So contract: +1 (from your A0) +1 (from opponent's A1) = +2
- Total: 0 + 2 = **2**

Wait — that seems too good.

Hold on: **Is the contract cumulative**?

Let’s read carefully:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.

So **if you choose A0**, you get +1, and the **other players** are responsible for paying it. Since the other player is only one, they lose 1.

> If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So **if you choose A1**, you lose 1, and the **other players** receive that 1.

So your **net transfer** from the contract is:

- If you play A0 → you gain +1 → opponent pays you 1
- If you play A1 → you lose -1 → opponent gains 1

This applies **regardless** of the opponent’s action.

So the **contract effect on you** is:

- A0 → +1
- A1 → -1

Because:
- A0: you get +1 (from opponent paying you)
- A1: you pay -1 (so you lose 1 to opponent)

So **your personal contract outcome** depends only on your own action.

Similarly, opponent gets +1 if they play A0, -1 if they play A1.

Therefore, **the contract is separable**: for each player, their contract gain is:

- +1 if they choose A0
- -1 if they choose A1

This is independent of the other player’s choice.

So you **always** get +1 for A0, -1 for A1, no matter what the other does.

Thus, **the contract adds a fixed +1 to your payoff if you play A0**, and **-1 if you play A1**, regardless of the outcome.

So we can **adjust the base payoffs** by adding:

- +1 to every cell where you play A0
- -1 to every cell where you play A1

Let’s do that.

---

### **Step 4: Update Payoffs with Contract**

Original base payoffs (you = Player 2):

| You \ Opponent | A0       | A1       |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**         | 2        | 0        |
| **A1**         | 3        | 1        |

Apply contract adjustment:

- For every **A0** you play: add +1
- For every **A1** you play: add -1

So new payoffs:

| You \ Opponent | A0       | A1       |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**         | 2 +1 = 3 | 0 +1 = 1 |
| **A1**         | 3 -1 = 2 | 1 -1 = 0 |

So your **adjusted payoff matrix** is:

- (A0, A0): 3
- (A0, A1): 1
- (A1, A0): 2
- (A1, A1): 0

Now, your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff**, given that you choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1, and the opponent chooses their own independently (but we must anticipate their likely strategy too — we’re in a game-theoretic setting).

Let’s define:
- You play A0 with probability **p**
- Opponent plays A0 with probability **q**

Your expected payoff:

> E = p * [q * 3 + (1 - q) * 1] + (1 - p) * [q * 2 + (1 - q) * 0]

Simplify:

= p [3q + 1 - q] + (1 - p)[2q]
= p [2q + 1] + (1 - p)(2q)
= p(2q + 1) + 2q - 2pq
= 2pq + p + 2q - 2pq
= p + 2q

So your **expected payoff** is:

> E = p + 2q

You want to maximize this, but you don’t control q — the opponent chooses q.

But **you** choose p (your strategy), and the opponent also chooses q (to maximize *their* payoff).

So we must look for **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

But here’s the key: you want to **choose p** to maximize your expected payoff **given that the opponent will also best-respond**.

So we need to analyze the opponent’s best response.

---

### **Step 5: Opponent’s Payoff Structure (Player 1)**

You are Player 2. Opponent is Player 1.

We need to compute Player 1’s expected payoff to find their optimal strategy.

Player 1’s base payoffs (from original):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 2  | 3  |
| A1     | 0  | 1  |

Now, **contract effect on P1** (Player 1):
- If P1 plays A0 → +1
- If P1 plays A1 → -1

So adjust P1’s payoffs:

- (A0, A0): 2 + 1 = 3
- (A0, A1): 3 + 1 = 4
- (A1, A0): 0 - 1 = -1
- (A1, A1): 1 - 1 = 0

So P1’s adjusted payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0    | A1    |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A0     | 3     | 4     |
| A1     | -1    | 0     |

Now, if P1 plays A0 with probability **q**, and you (P2) play A0 with probability **p**, then P1’s expected payoff is:

> E1 = q [p * 3 + (1 - p) * 4] + (1 - q) [p * (-1) + (1 - p) * 0]

Simplify:

= q [3p + 4 - 4p] + (1 - q) [-p]
= q [4 - p] - p(1 - q)
= 4q - pq - p + pq
= 4q - p

So P1’s expected payoff: E1 = 4q - p

Now, to find **best response of P1**:
- They choose q to maximize: 4q - p
- This is linear in q.

So:
- If 4 > 0 (always true), P1 wants to **maximize q**
- So **best response**: play A0 with probability 1 → q = 1

Because the coefficient of q is 4, positive → higher q is always better.

So **regardless of p**, P1’s best response is to set **q = 1** — always play A0.

That’s a **dominant strategy** for P1: A0 always gives higher expected payoff.

Wait — is that true?

Let’s double-check.

From E1 = 4q - p

For a fixed p, since 4q increases with q, maximum at q = 1.

Yes — so no matter what p is, P1 gets higher payoff by choosing q = 1.

Therefore, **in equilibrium, Player 1 will play A0 with probability 1**.

So q = 1

Now, go back to your **expected payoff**: E = p + 2q

But q = 1 → E = p + 2

To maximize E, you want to maximize p → set p = 1

So you should play A0 with probability 100%

Then your expected payoff is 1 + 2 = 3

Let’s verify:

- You play A0 (p=1)
- Opponent plays A0 (q=1)
- Base: 2
- Contract: you play A0 → +1
- Opponent plays A0 → +1 → you pay them 1
- Net contract: 0
- Total: 2 + 0 = 2

Wait — this contradicts our earlier calculation.

What’s going on?

Earlier we said your adjusted payoff matrix was:

- (A0, A0): 3 (from base 2 + contract +1) → but we just said the contract net is 0?

Ah — **mistake in contract interpretation.**

Let’s clarify once and for all.

We said:
- You play A0 → you get +1 **from opponent**
- Opponent plays A0 → opponent gets +1 **from you**

So if both play A0:
- You gain +1 from your own A0
- You lose +1 because opponent is playing A0 and taking +1 from you

So net: 0

Similarly, only if **one player plays A0** and the other plays A1 does the contract give a **net transfer**.

So the **net effect depends on the combination**.

So our earlier **simplification** that "A0 always adds +1 to you" was wrong.

We **cannot** just add +1 to every cell where you play A0 — because if opponent plays A0, they also trigger +1 to themselves, which you must bear.

So the contract outcome is **not separable per player’s action alone** in terms of net gain.

We must compute the **net transfer** per outcome.

Let’s recompute the **full adjusted payoff for you**, considering **both players’ contract actions**.

---

### **Step 6: Correct Contract Net Effect by Outcome**

Let’s define the **net contract effect to you** for each outcome:

| You \ Opp | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| **A0**   | ?  | ?  |
| **A1**   | ?  | ?  |

- If you play A0: you receive +1 (from opponents)
- If you play A1: you pay -1 (to opponents)

Similarly:
- If opponent plays A0: they receive +1 → you pay them 1
- If opponent plays A1: they pay -1 → you receive +1

So the **net to you** from contract is:
- You gain +1 for your A0
- You lose +1 for opponent’s A0 (since they gain it from you)
- You gain +1 for opponent’s A1 (since they pay it to you)
- You lose -1 for your A1 (you pay it)

Let’s tabulate:

#### (You A0, Opp A0)
- Your A0 → +1
- Opp A0 → you lose 1
- Net contract: 1 - 1 = 0
- Base: 2
- Total: 2 + 0 = 2

#### (You A0, Opp A1)
- Your A0 → +1
- Opp A1 → opponent pays -1 → so you gain +1
- Net contract: 1 + 1 = +2
- Base: 0
- Total: 0 + 2 = 2

#### (You A1, Opp A0)
- Your A1 → you pay -1
- Opp A0 → opponent gets +1 → you lose 1
- Net contract: -1 -1 = -2
- Base: 3
- Total: 3 - 2 = 1

#### (You A1, Opp A1)
- Your A1 → pay -1
- Opp A1 → opponent pays -1 → you gain +1
- Net contract: -1 + 1 = 0
- Base: 1
- Total: 1 + 0 = 1

So the **true adjusted payoff matrix for you** is:

| You \ Opp | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| **A0**   | 2  | 2  |
| **A1**   | 1  | 1  |

That's amazing!

So **no matter what the opponent does**, if you play A0, you get 2; if you play A1, you get 1.

Your **best response is to always play A0**.

Because:
- A0 → always gives you 2 points
- A1 → always gives you 1 point

So regardless of what opponent does, A0 is better.

Even stronger: A0 gives you **2** in both cases, A1 gives you **1** in both cases.

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you.

Therefore, **you should play A0 with probability 100%**.

But wait — what about the opponent?

We must ensure that this leads to equilibrium.

Let’s compute the opponent’s (Player 1) **adjusted payoff**.

Player 1's base payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 2  | 3  |
| A1     | 0  | 1  |

Contract for P1:
- If P1 plays A0 → gets +1
- If P1 plays A1 → pays -1

And transfers:
- If P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +1 → P1 pays 1
- If P2 plays A1 → P2 pays -1 → P1 gets +1

So net contract effect to P1:

#### (P1 A0, P2 A0)
- P1 A0: +1
- P2 A0: P2 gets +1 → P1 pays 1
- Net: 1 - 1 = 0
- Base: 2
- Total: 2

#### (P1 A0, P2 A1)
- P1 A0: +1
- P2 A1: P2 pays -1 → P1 gets +1
- Net: 1 + 1 = +2
- Base: 3
- Total: 5

#### (P1 A1, P2 A0)
- P1 A1: pays -1
- P2 A0: P2 gets +1 → P1 pays 1
- Net: -1 -1 = -2
- Base: 0
- Total: -2

#### (P1 A1, P2 A1)
- P1 A1: -1
- P2 A1: P2 pays -1 → P1 gets +1
- Net: -1 + 1 = 0
- Base: 1
- Total: 1

So P1's payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | 2  | 5  |
| **A1** | -2 | 1  |

So if P2 plays A0 (which we are assuming), then P1’s payoff:
- A0: 2
- A1: -2

So P1’s best response: A0

If P2 plays A1, then:
- P1: A0 → 5, A1 → 1 → best is A0

So **in both cases, P1's best response is A0**

So P1 will always play A0

Therefore, **if you play A0**, P1 plays A0, your payoff is 2

If you play A1, even if P1 plays A0, you get 1 → worse

And since both A0 and A1 give you fixed payoff regardless of opponent (as we saw), but A0 gives 2, A1 gives 1, you should **always play A0**

So optimal strategy: **play A0 with 100% probability**

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game (no contract)

The payoff matrix shows a prisoner's dilemma structure:
- If other plays A0: I get 2 from A0 or 3 from A1 → A1 is better
- If other plays A1: I get 0 from A0 or 1 from A1 → A1 is better

So A1 dominates A0. By symmetry, both players will choose A1.

**Base game outcome: (A1, A1) → I get 1 point**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With C1, playing A1 costs 2 points paid to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 2, other gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0+2=2, other gets 3-2=1  
- (A1, A0): I get 3-2=1, other gets 0+2=2
- (A1, A1): I get 1, other gets 1

Now:
- If other plays A0: I get 2 from A0 or 1 from A1 → A0 is better
- If other plays A1: I get 2 from A0 or 1 from A1 → A0 is better

**C1 outcome: (A0, A0) → I get 2 points** ✓ Better than base game!

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

With C2, playing A1 costs 1 point paid to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 2, other gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0+1=1, other gets 3-1=2
- (A1, A0): I get 3-1=2, other gets 0+1=1  
- (A1, A1): I get 1, other gets 1

Now:
- If other plays A0: I get 2 from A0 or 2 from A1 → indifferent
- If other plays A1: I get 1 from A0 or 1 from A1 → indifferent

**C2 outcome: Multiple equilibria possible, payoff between 1-2** (likely 2 if we coordinate on (A0,A0), but less certain)

## Step 4: Strategic approval decision

My preference: **C1 > C2 > No contract**

Let me check what happens with different approval combinations:

| Other's approval | If I approve only C1 | If I approve both C1 & C2 |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Only C1         | C1 wins (2-0)       | C1 wins (2-1)            |
| Only C2         | 50-50 tie           | C2 wins (1-2)            |
| Both            | C1 wins (2-1)       | 50-50 tie                |

Approving only C1 is better because:
- Against "only C2": 50-50 gamble is better than guaranteed C2 (since I prefer C1)
- Against "both": guaranteed C1 is better than 50-50
- Against "only C1": same result either way

**Conclusion: Approve only C1**

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base payoffs
The original game is:
- (A0, A0): I get 2, other gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 1, other gets 1

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma structure.

## Step 2: Apply the contract modifications
The contract states:
- Choosing A0: receive +1 point from the other player
- Choosing A1: pay 1 point to the other player

For each outcome, I need to calculate:
- My base payoff
- +1 if I choose A0 (or -1 if I choose A1)
- -1 if other chooses A0 (or +1 if other chooses A1)

## Step 3: Calculate modified payoffs

**(A0, A0):** 
- Base: 2
- I chose A0: +1
- Other chose A0: -1
- **Total: 2**

**(A0, A1):**
- Base: 0
- I chose A0: +1
- Other chose A1: +1
- **Total: 2**

**(A1, A0):**
- Base: 3
- I chose A1: -1
- Other chose A0: -1
- **Total: 1**

**(A1, A1):**
- Base: 1
- I chose A1: -1
- Other chose A1: +1
- **Total: 1**

## Step 4: Analyze the modified game

My payoff matrix is:
```
           Other: A0    Other: A1
My A0:        2            2
My A1:        1            1
```

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - I get 2 points regardless of what the other player does if I choose A0, versus only 1 point if I choose A1.

## Step 5: Determine optimal strategy

Since A0 strictly dominates A1, the optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability. This maximizes my expected payoff to 2 points.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Let me analyze this step by step.

## Step 1: Understanding the Basic Payoffs
Without the contract, from my perspective (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 1

## Step 2: Applying the Contract
The contract states: "If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points distributed equally among other players."

Since there are only 2 players, this means:
- If I choose A1: I pay 2 points to the other player
- If other chooses A1: They pay 2 points to me

## Step 3: Calculate Modified Payoffs

**Case 1: I choose A0, Other chooses A0**
- Base: 2 points
- Adjustments: None
- **Final: 2 points**

**Case 2: I choose A0, Other chooses A1**
- Base: 0 points
- Adjustments: +2 (other pays me)
- **Final: 2 points**

**Case 3: I choose A1, Other chooses A0**
- Base: 3 points
- Adjustments: -2 (I pay other)
- **Final: 1 point**

**Case 4: I choose A1, Other chooses A1**
- Base: 1 point
- Adjustments: -2 (I pay) +2 (other pays me) = 0
- **Final: 1 point**

## Step 4: Analyze the Strategic Situation

Modified payoff matrix for me:
```
           Other: A0    Other: A1
My A0:        2            2
My A1:        1            1
```

**A0 strictly dominates A1!** 
- If I play A0: I get 2 points (regardless of opponent's choice)
- If I play A1: I get 1 point (regardless of opponent's choice)

## Conclusion
Since A0 gives me 2 points in all scenarios while A1 only gives me 1 point in all scenarios, I should always choose A0.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Let me analyze this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the Original Payoffs

The base game payoffs for me (Player 1) are:
- (A0, A0): I get 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 1

## Step 2: Apply the Contract

The contract states:
- Choosing A0: no payment
- Choosing A1: pay 2 points (distributed to the other player since there are only 2 players)

## Step 3: Calculate Modified Payoffs

Let me recalculate my payoffs WITH the contract:

**Case (A0, A0):**
- Base: 2
- I pay: 0 (chose A0)
- I receive: 0 (other chose A0)
- **Final: 2**

**Case (A0, A1):**
- Base: 0
- I pay: 0 (chose A0)
- I receive: 2 (other chose A1)
- **Final: 2**

**Case (A1, A0):**
- Base: 3
- I pay: 2 (chose A1)
- I receive: 0 (other chose A0)
- **Final: 1**

**Case (A1, A1):**
- Base: 1
- I pay: 2 (chose A1)
- I receive: 2 (other chose A1)
- **Final: 1**

## Step 4: Analyze the Modified Game

My modified payoffs:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 2, A1 gives me 1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 2, A1 gives me 1 → **A0 is better**

## Step 5: Determine Optimal Strategy

A0 **strictly dominates** A1 regardless of what the other player does. I always get 2 points with A0, but only 1 point with A1.

The contract effectively penalizes the aggressive action (A1), making cooperation (A0) the dominant strategy.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

This is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoffs first, Player 2's second):

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (2, 2) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (1, 1) |

This is a classic **"Battle of the Sexes"**-like game with some asymmetric incentives.

Let’s analyze the **Nash equilibria** of this base game:

- **Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria**:
  - (A0, A0): If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 2 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → P2 wants to deviate? No, A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 → so P2 wants to play A1. So P2 would deviate → not NE.
    Wait — let's be careful:

Check (A0, A0):
- P1: 2 (if P2 plays A0), if P1 switches to A1, gets 3 → so P1 wants to deviate → not NE.
Check (A1, A1):
- P1: 1, if switches to A0 → gets 0 → no incentive to deviate.
- P2: 1, if switches to A0 → gets 0 → no incentive.
→ So (A1, A1) **is a pure NE**.

Check (A0, A1):
- P1: 0, if switches to A1 → gets 1 → wants to deviate.
- P2: 3, if switches to A0 → gets 2 → wants to deviate.
→ Not NE.

Check (A1, A0):
- P1: 3, if switches to A0 → gets 2 → no incentive.
- P2: 0, if switches to A1 → gets 3 → wants to deviate.
→ Not NE.

So the only **pure strategy Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1).

Now, mixed strategy equilibrium:

Let P1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p).  
Let P2 play A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q).

For P1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- EU(A0) = 2q + 0(1−q) = 2q
- EU(A1) = 3q + 1(1−q) = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1
Set equal: 2q = 2q + 1 → 0 = 1 → impossible → **no mixed equilibrium** in which P1 is indifferent? Wait, actually we must solve for when P2’s strategy makes P1 indifferent.

Wait: we want to find mixed strategy such that each player is indifferent.

Let’s suppose P2 plays A0 with probability q.

Then P1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 2q + 0(1−q) = 2q
- A1: 3q + 1(1−q) = 2q + 1

Set equal: 2q = 2q + 1 → 0 = 1 → contradiction.

So **no pure or mixed strategy makes P1 indifferent** between A0 and A1? That can’t be.

Wait — the issue is: P1’s payoff from A0 is 2q + 0(1−q) = 2q  
From A1: 3q + 1(1−q) = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1

So for any q, A1 gives **more** than A0: since 2q + 1 > 2q

→ So P1 **always prefers A1** no matter what P2 does.

Similarly, look at P2:
- If P1 plays A0 with probability p:
  - P2’s payoff from A0: 2p + 0(1−p) = 2p
  - P2’s payoff from A1: 3p + 1(1−p) = 2p + 1
→ Again, for any p, A1 gives 2p+1 > 2p → so P2 **always prefers A1**

→ Therefore, **(A1, A1) is the unique Nash equilibrium**, and **both players will play A1 in equilibrium**, regardless of beliefs.

So in the base game, optimal play is A1 for both.

---

### **Step 2: The Contract**

Now, Player 2 proposes a contract:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So, if **you** play A0, you get +2 points (from the contract), but since payment is “drawn equally from the other players,” and you are Player 1, this 2 points must come from Player 2.

So:
- If **you** play A0: you get +2, Player 2 gets -2
- If **you** play A1: no extra
- If **Player 2** plays A0: Player 2 gets +2, you get -2

Thus, **the contract changes the payoff matrix**.

And **only if both players sign**, the contract is active.

We are deciding whether **to sign** the contract — i.e., whether to commit to it.

But the contract only takes effect **if both sign**.

So if you **don’t sign**, the contract doesn't apply, and payoff is as before.

If you **sign**, but the other player doesn't, the contract still doesn't apply.

So the **outcome depends on mutual agreement**.

But you are deciding **whether to sign** — you can’t force Player 2 to sign.

So your decision affects whether the contract can activate.

But crucially: **the contract is only active if both sign.**

So you have to reason: **if I sign, and Player 2 signs, what happens? Is it better than the base game (A1,A1)?**

And also: **what is the probability Player 2 will sign?** We don’t know — but we can assume that Player 2 is rational and will also evaluate whether signing benefits them.

Wait — the contract was **proposed by Player 2** and decided via **approval voting** — but we are told this is the **selected contract**. So it’s now on the table.

But the key is: we are asked **whether to sign**, with the understanding that **it only becomes active if all players sign**.

So if you sign and Player 2 doesn’t, no contract → original game.

If you don’t sign, no contract → original game.

So **you can only benefit if you both sign**, which requires mutual agreement.

Hence, the **only way** the contract affects your payoff is if **you both sign** → and then the payoffs change.

So we must ask: given that the contract is proposed by Player 2, and assuming they will only sign **if it benefits them**, would **they sign**? And **would signing benefit you**?

Let’s simulate the **contracted game**.

---

### **Step 3: Payoffs with the Contract (if both sign)**

We must add the contract terms to the base payoffs.

Recall:
- If a player chooses A0 → they get +2
- If a player chooses A0 → the other player gets -2

So modify the payoff matrix:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (2 + 2, 2 - 2) = (4, 0) | (0 + 2, 3 - 2) = (2, 1) |
| **P1: A1** | (3 - 2, 0 + 2) = (1, 2) | (1, 1) |

Explanation:
- (A0, A0): P1 plays A0 → gets +2 from contract → base 2 → total 4. P2 plays A0 → gets +2 from contract, but P1’s A0 costs P2 2 → so P2's total: base 2 + 2 (contract) - 2 (transfer) = 2? Wait — this is ambiguous.

Wait, the contract says: *"they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."*

So if a player chooses A0, they get +2, and the **other player** loses 2.

So the **net transfer** is: when a player plays A0, they get +2, and the other player gets -2.

Thus, the **total sum of payoffs** is reduced by 2 for each A0 played? Let's see:

If both play A0:
- P1 gets +2 (contract), P2 gets +2 (contract), but P1 pays 2 to P2? Wait, no — the wording: *"drawn equally from the other players"*

This is ambiguous.

But: "if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So: **the payer is the other player(s).**

Since only one other player, the **other player pays 2**, and the choosing player gets +2.

So **net effect**: one player gains 2, the other loses 2 → **zero-sum transfer**.

So when P1 plays A0: P1 gets +2, P2 gets -2  
When P2 plays A0: P2 gets +2, P1 gets -2

So the total payoff sum is **not preserved** — it changes by -2 if one plays A0, or -4 if both play A0.

Let’s recompute:

**Payoffs with contract (both players signed)**:

1. (A0, A0):
   - P1: base (2) + 2 (from contracting A0) + (-2) (because P2 played A0 → P1 loses 2) → 2 + 2 - 2 = **2**
   - P2: base (2) + 2 (from contracting A0) + (-2) (because P1 played A0) → 2 + 2 - 2 = **2**

Wait — but the contract says: "if a player chooses A0, they receive +2 **drawn from the other player**".

So the +2 is **from the other player** — so the other player **loses 2**.

So yes:
- When P1 plays A0: P1 gains 2, P2 loses 2
- When P2 plays A0: P2 gains 2, P1 loses 2

So in (A0, A0):
- P1: base 2 + 2 (contract) - 2 (because P2 played A0) = 2
- P2: base 2 + 2 (contract) - 2 (because P1 played A0) = 2

Same as before.

But in (A0, A1):
- P1: plays A0 → gets +2, but P2 didn’t play A0, so P1 doesn’t lose anything from P2 → so only +2 from contract → base payoff: 0 → total: 0 + 2 = 2
- P2: plays A1 → no contract gain, but P1 played A0 → so P2 loses 2 → base payoff 3 → total: 3 - 2 = 1

So (2, 1) → as before.

In (A1, A0):
- P1: plays A1 → no contract gain; but P2 played A0 → so P1 loses 2 → base payoff: 3 → total: 3 - 2 = 1
- P2: plays A0 → gets +2 from contract; P1 played A1 → so P2 does not lose to P1 → so base 0 + 2 = 2

So (1, 2)

In (A1, A1):
- Both play A1 → no contract gain/loss → same as base: (1, 1)

So final **contracted payoff matrix**:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (2, 2) | (2, 1) |
| **P1: A1** | (1, 2) | (1, 1) |

Wait — that’s interesting.

So **the contract does not change any payoffs** in this case?

That can’t be right.

Wait — let’s double-check:

- (A0, A0): both play A0 → each gets +2 from contract, but each loses -2 to the other → so net 2 + 2 - 2 = 2 → yes, (2,2) → same as before.

- (A0, A1): P1 gets +2 (contract), P2 gets -2 (because P1 played A0), but P2 played A1 so no contract gain → P1’s base is 0 → total: 0 + 2 = 2; P2’s base is 3 → 3 - 2 = 1 → (2,1)

- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → no contract gain; P2 plays A0 → so P1 loses 2 → base 3 → 3 - 2 = 1; P2 gets +2 from contract → base 0 + 2 = 2 → (1,2)

- (A1, A1): no contract action → (1,1)

So **the new payoff matrix is**:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (2, 2) | (2, 1) |
| **P1: A1** | (1, 2) | (1, 1) |

Now this is **very different**.

Now, in this game:

Look at P1's best responses:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1: A0 → 2; A1 → 1 → so prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1: A0 → 2; A1 → 1 → prefer A0

→ So **P1 always wants to play A0**, no matter what.

Similarly, P2:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2: A0 → 2; A1 → 1 → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2: A0 → 2; A1 → 1 → prefer A0

→ So **P2 also always wants to play A0**

So **(A0, A0) is the unique Nash equilibrium** in the contracted game.

And payoff is (2,2) for both.

In the **base game**, equilibrium was (A1, A1) with (1,1)

So **both players get 2 instead of 1** if the contract is signed and both play A0.

So **both players gain** by signing the contract.

But does Player 2 want to sign?

Yes — because in the base game, if they don’t sign, they get 1 in equilibrium (via (A1,A1)).

But if they sign and you also sign, then **they get 2**.

So **Player 2 strictly benefits** by signing, assuming you sign.

Similarly, you go from 1 to 2.

So **both players have incentive to sign the contract**.

Moreover, the contract forces the outcome to (A0, A0), which is better for both.

But wait — is there an issue?

In the contracted game, both want to play A0, so they will.

But what if one player doesn’t sign?

Then **contract is inactive**, back to base game.

So the **only way** to get the benefit is **both sign**.

So if you sign the contract, and Player 2 does too → you both get 2.

If you sign, Player 2 doesn’t → contract inactive → base game → you get 1 (in equilibrium).

If you don’t sign → contract inactive → base game → same → you get 1.

So, **if you sign and Player 2 signs** → you get 2 → better.

**If you sign and Player 2 doesn’t** → you get 1 → worse than if you hadn’t signed.

But **if you don’t sign**, you get 1 regardless.

So your **expected payoff from signing depends on Player 2’s decision**.

But can you assume Player 2 will sign?

Let’s think: **Player 2 proposed the contract** — and it was selected via approval voting.

So they have a strong incentive to **make it beneficial**, or at least not harmful.

And the contract **benefits them**: in base game they get 1; in signed game, they get 2 — assuming you also sign.

But do they believe you will sign?

In equilibrium, if they believe you will sign, then they get 2 by signing — better than 1.

If they believe you won’t sign, they get 1 anyway — so they are indifferent.

But if they think you will sign, and they don’t, they get 1.

If they sign and you sign, they get 2 — so they **prefer** to sign **if they believe you will sign**.

Now, **do you have incentive to sign?**

Yes — because if you sign, and they sign, you get 2.

If you don’t sign, you get 1.

So **if Player 2 signs, you want to sign**.

And **if you sign, Player 2 wants to sign**.

So there is a **coordinating equilibrium** where both sign → and then both play A0 → both get 2.

Is there any reason to distrust?

Suppose Player 2 thinks you won’t sign.

Then they get 1 either way.

If they sign, and you don’t sign → contract inactive → they get 1.

If you sign, they get 2.

So Player 2 will **prefer to sign only if they believe you will sign**.

Similarly, you will want to sign only if you believe they will sign.

So can you coordinate?

Yes — **this is a coordination game with a Pareto-superior equilibrium**.

Moreover, **the contract was proposed by Player 2** — they are trying to **move the game to (A0,A0)**, which is better for both.

So it is **in Player 2’s interest to want you to sign**, and they expect you to sign.

So **rational players will sign**, leading to (A0,A0) with (2,2).

In contrast, the base game leads to (1,1) — worse for both.

So **signing the contract is a dominant strategy for both**, **once the contract is in place**, and the equilibrium shifts.

Wait — is that true?

In the **contracted game**, is playing A0 a dominant strategy?

Yes — for both players.

But the key is: **you are deciding whether to sign the contract**.

So you are **in the pre-signing stage**, deciding whether to commit.

But if you sign, and Player 2 signs, you get 2.

If you don’t sign, you get 1.

Moreover, since both benefit from signing, and Player 2 is the proposer, it’s likely that they **will sign** if you do.

You can assume that if you sign, Player 2 will also sign — because it's beneficial for them.

And if you don’t sign, they won’t sign (since it does nothing for them).

So by signing, you can **coordinate** on the better outcome.

Is there any risk?

Yes — if you sign and Player 2 doesn’t sign, then contract inactive → you get 1.

But if you **don’t sign**, you also get 1.

So the **worst case for signing is same as not signing**.

The **best case for signing is better (2 vs 1)**.

So **signing has no downside** — only upside, assuming rational Player 2.

Even if there’s uncertainty, since signing gives you **at least 1** (if they don’t sign), and **up to 2** (if they do), while not signing gives you **exactly 1** (in equilibrium), **signing is weakly better**.

But in fact, in the **game where the contract is signed**, both players are better off.

And **Player 2 is rational and proposed the contract** → they intend for the contract to be signed.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

---

### **Final Decision**

Signing the contract allows both players to coordinate on a better outcome (A0,A0 → 2 each) instead of the inefficient (A1,A1 → 1 each).

The contract induces both players to prefer A0, and since Player 2 proposed it, they will likely sign if you do.

Your payoff from signing is either 1 (if they don’t sign) or 2 (if they do) → expected value ≥1.

Your payoff from not signing is 1 → so signing is at least as good, and potentially better.

Therefore, **signing is rational and beneficial**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)

This is a 2-player matrix game with the following payoff matrix (for Player 1):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

We can analyze this as a standard game theory problem.

This game is known as a variant of the "stag hunt" or "coordination game" with some mixed incentives.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria.

- (A0, A0): Both get 2. If Player 1 deviates to A1, gets 3 > 2 → so not stable (Player 1 wants to deviate).
- (A1, A1): Both get 1. If Player 1 deviates to A0, gets 0 < 1 → no incentive to deviate? Wait: if Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 1 from A1, 0 from A0 → so no deviation.
  But wait: if Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 prefers A1 (1 > 0). If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 prefers A1 (3 > 2). So **A1 is strictly better than A0** for Player 1 no matter what Player 2 does.

Wait — let’s recheck:

- If Player 2 plays A0: Player 1 gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1
- If Player 2 plays A1: Player 1 gets 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A1

So **A1 dominates A0 for Player 1**.

Similarly, for Player 2:

- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A1

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2** too.

👉 Therefore, the only Nash equilibrium in pure strategies is **(A1, A1)**, where both get 1 point.

But note: if both play A0, they both get 2 — which is better than 1. So there’s a coordination issue.

But since A1 is strictly dominant for both, rational players will choose A1, leading to (1,1).

So **in the base game, if both play rationally**, outcome is (A1, A1), payoffs (1,1).

---

### Step 2: Now consider the contract

The contract says:

- If a player chooses A0 → they receive +1 point (drawn equally from others)
- If a player chooses A1 → they pay -1 point (distributed equally among others)

Since there are two players, "equally from others" means:

- If you play A0 → you gain +1, and the other player loses 1 (since the +1 is from the other player).
- If you play A1 → you lose 1, and the other player gains 1.

Wait: the wording is:
> "they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if you play A0: you get +1, and that 1 point is taken **from** the other player(s). Since there is one other player, that player loses 1.

Similarly:
> "they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players."

So if you play A1: you pay 1 point, which is split among other players — so the other player gets +1.

So net effect of the contract:

If you play A0: +1 to you, -1 to opponent  
If you play A1: -1 to you, +1 to opponent

So the contract **reverses the incentives** compared to the original game.

Let’s now compute the **total payoff** under the contract, assuming both players sign it.

For each combination, we add the contract payoff to the base payoff.

Let’s build the new payoff matrix (including contract effects).

#### Case 1: You play A0, Other plays A0
- Base: (2, 2)
- Contract: You +1, Other -1 → so total: (3, 1)

#### Case 2: You play A0, Other plays A1
- Base: (0, 3)
- Contract: You +1, Other -1 → total: (1, 2)

#### Case 3: You play A1, Other plays A0
- Base: (3, 0)
- Contract: You -1, Other +1 → total: (2, 1)

#### Case 4: You play A1, Other plays A1
- Base: (1, 1)
- Contract: You -1, Other -1 → total: (0, 0)

So the **new payoff matrix** is:

|               | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| **You: A0**   | (3, 1)    | (1, 2)    |
| **You: A1**   | (2, 1)    | (0, 0)    |

Now, what are the best responses for **you**?

- If Other plays A0:
  - You get 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefer A0
- If Other plays A1:
  - You get 1 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 dominates A1** for you in the contract game!

Similarly for the other player?

- If you play A0:
  - Other gets 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A1
- If you play A1:
  - Other gets 1 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefers A0

So other player has **no dominant strategy** — but let’s see if there’s a Nash equilibrium.

But note: **you** have a dominant strategy: always play A0.

You will play A0 no matter what.

If you play A0, the other player’s best response: compare payoff from A0 (1) vs A1 (2) → so they prefer A1.

So Nash equilibrium: you play A0, other plays A1 → outcome: (1,2)

Wait, but you want to **maximize your own points**.

In this equilibrium, you get 1.

But can you do better?

Let’s simulate: since you play A0 (dominant), other plays A1 (best response), you get 1.

Is there any other outcome?

Suppose you don’t sign the contract.

Then, as before, the only pure-strategy NE is (A1, A1), giving you 1 point.

But also, there could be mixed strategies.

Let’s now evaluate your **expected payoff** depending on whether you sign the contract.

---

### Step 3: Compare expected outcomes under contract vs without contract

#### Without contract:
As analyzed earlier, A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players.

So rational players will play A1 ⇒ outcome: (A1,A1), you get **1 point**.

Even if they coordinate on (A0,A0) → you get 2, but that’s not a Nash equilibrium, so unlikely if both are rational.

So **expected payoff without contract** = 1 (if both act rationally)

But: can there be mixed strategies?

Let’s compute the mixed strategy equilibrium of the base game.

Let p = probability player 1 plays A0  
Let q = probability player 2 plays A0

Player 1's expected payoff:

- If player 1 plays A0: 2*q + 0*(1−q) = 2q
- If player 1 plays A1: 3*q + 1*(1−q) = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1

So player 1 is indifferent when: 2q = 2q + 1? No — 2q < 2q + 1 → A1 always better.

So player 1 always wants to play A1 (since 2q + 1 > 2q)

Thus, **no mixed strategy equilibrium in which player 1 randomizes** — A1 is strictly dominant.

Same for player 2: A1 always better.

So **only equilibrium is (A1,A1)**, you get 1 point.

So **without contract: you get 1 point**.

---

#### With contract: you sign it

Then the new game matrix is as above, and we found:

- You have a dominant strategy: play A0
- Given that, other player’s best response: play A1 (since 2 > 1)
- So outcome: (A0, A1), you get **1 point**

Wait — same as before?

But let's double-check:

- You play A0
- Other plays A1
- Base payoff: (0, 3)
- Contract: you get +1, other loses 1 → total: (1, 2)

Yes, you get 1.

So you get **1 point**.

But is that the only outcome?

Could you get more?

No — since A0 is your dominant strategy, you’ll play it.

The other player, knowing that, will play A1 (since 2 > 1).

So **you get 1 point** with contract.

Same as without.

But wait — could the other player also sign and change their behavior?

Yes — but we already assumed they will respond rationally.

But here’s the key: **the contract only takes effect if both players sign it**.

You are deciding **whether to sign**.

So:

- If you **don’t sign**, the base game applies → you get 1 (from (A1,A1))
- If you **do sign**, and the other signs (which they may or may not), then the new game applies.

But the question is: do you sign?

But the other player is also rational.

So let’s imagine a scenario:

Suppose you sign the contract.

What does the other player see?

They see the modified game, where if they play A0, they get 1 (if you play A0) vs 2 (if they play A1) → so they prefer A1.

But if the contract is active, their payoffs are altered.

But can they **not sign**?

Yes — the contract only applies if **both** sign.

So if you sign but the other doesn’t, then **no contract applies**, and the base game applies.

Similarly, if you don’t sign, contract does not apply, regardless of what the other does.

So you are choosing: **sign or not sign**

Your expected payoff depends on:

1. Whether you sign
2. Whether the other player signs
3. Their rational choice

Let’s model this.

### Step 4: Strategic Consideration — Contract as a coordination device?

Let’s consider the possible cases:

#### Case A: You sign, and other signs → contract active

Then new game: you play A0 (dominant), other plays A1 → payoff (1,2) → you get **1**

#### Case B: You sign, other does not sign → contract inactive → base game applies

Then both play rational strategies → both play A1 → payoff (1,1) → you get **1**

#### Case C: You do not sign → contract inactive → base game → both play A1 → you get **1**

So no matter what, you get **1**?

Wait — this suggests that signing or not signing gives you the same outcome.

But wait — what if the other player’s behavior changes?

In Case A: both sign → you get 1  
In Cases B and C: you get 1

So always 1?

So no difference?

But let's check carefully.

In base game, you get 1.

In contract game, you get 1.

So **no gain**?

But wait — is it possible that by signing, you can induce the other player to play differently?

Yes — but only if **they believe** the contract will be in effect.

But here’s the catch: the other player is rational and wants to maximize their own points.

So let’s suppose you **sign the contract**.

Now, what does the other player do?

They will ask: “What happens if I sign?” and “What happens if I don’t?”

Let’s suppose you are going to sign (commit to signing), and they are deciding whether to sign.

So they face two possibilities:

### Option 1: Other signs → contract active

Then the game is the modified one:

|               | You: A0 | You: A1 |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Other: A0** | (3,1)   | (2,1)   |
| **Other: A1** | (1,2)   | (0,0)   |

So if other signs, and you play A0 (as you will, since dominant), then other's best response is to play A1 (get 2) vs A0 (get 1) → so they play A1 → you get 1, other gets 2

### Option 2: Other does **not** sign → contract inactive → base game applies

Then it's the original game, and both play A1 (since A1 dominates) → payoff (1,1) → other gets 1

Now compare: if other signs → they get 2  
If other does **not** sign → they get 1

So **other player prefers to sign**, because then they get 2 > 1.

So the other player **will sign** if you sign.

Thus, if you sign, the other will also sign → contract activates → you get 1

Now, what if you **do not sign**?

Then contract cannot activate — no matter what the other does.

So base game applies → both play A1 → you get 1

So again: you get 1

So in both cases: you get 1

Therefore, **signing gives no benefit** — same payoff.

But is there a possibility of doing better?

Wait — what if you sign, contract activates, you play A0, other plays A1 → you get 1

But in base game, you get 1

So no difference.

But wait — **is there a way to get more than 1?**

Suppose both play A0 — then in base game, you get 2

But in the contract game, if both play A0, you get 3

So **if you could enforce A0, A0**, you’d get 3 in the contract game — better.

But with rational players, that equilibrium doesn’t survive.

But what if the contract creates a new incentive?

Let’s ask: **can the contract help coordinate on A0,A0?**

In the contract game, is (A0,A0) a Nash equilibrium?

Check:

- You play A0, other plays A0 → you get 3, other gets 1

- If you deviate to A1: you get 2 (from (A1,A0)) → 2 < 3 → so you don’t want to deviate

- If other deviates to A1: they get 2 (from (A0,A1)) → 2 > 1 → so they **do** want to deviate

So (A0,A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium — other player wants to switch to A1.

Similarly, (A1,A1): you get 0, other gets 0

If you deviate to A0: you get 1 > 0 → so want to deviate

Not an equilibrium.

(A0,A1): you get 1, other gets 2

- You: A0 → 1; if switch to A1 → get 0 < 1 → don’t want to deviate
- Other: A1 → 2; if switch to A0 → get 1 < 2 → don’t want to deviate

Wait — so (A0,A1) **is** a Nash equilibrium in the contract game!

Yes: both are best responding.

So in contract world, (A0,A1) is the unique NE.

But that gives you only 1.

In base game: (A1,A1) gives you 1.

Same.

So no gain.

But is there a way to get more?

Only if both play A0 — but that’s not stable.

So no.

Wait — but in the base game, **(A0,A0)** gives you 2, but it’s not a Nash equilibrium because both players want to deviate to A1 (since 3>2 and 0<2 respectively).

But with the contract, **(A0,A0)** becomes: you get 3, other gets 1

You don’t want to deviate (3 > 2? Wait, A1 gives you 2 < 3 → so you don’t want to deviate)

Other: if they deviate to A1, they get 2 > 1 → so they **do** want to deviate.

So still not stable.

So can’t coordinate on it.

But what if we consider **mixed strategies**?

In the contract game, is there a chance of getting better than 1?

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability 1 (dominant)

Then other plays A1 with probability 1 → you get 1

Same as before.

So no.

But wait — there’s a twist.

When the contract is active, **you gain more when you play A0 and other plays A0**.

But if the other player is rational, they won’t do that.

So you can’t get that.

But let’s think: is there any **strategic advantage** to signing?

In the base game, **you get 1**

In the contract game, **you still get 1** — same.

But the **other player gets 2** in the contract game — which is bad for them.

In the base game, they get 1.

So the other player might **not want** to sign.

But earlier we said: if you sign, then the other player gets 2 if they sign, 1 if they don’t.

So they **prefer to sign** → so they will sign.

So the contract does activate.

But you still get 1.

So net effect: no gain.

But here’s a key point: **in the base game, you get 1, and the other gets 1**

In the contract game, with both signing, **you get 1, other gets 2**

So you are **equally well off**, but the other player is better off?

Wait — but you signed — why would you agree if you get no benefit and help the other player?

But **you don’t lose** either.

And you **force** the other player to have an incentive to sign, because otherwise they get only 1.

So if you sign, and they are rational, they will sign too, so contract activates.

Then you get 1 — same as before.

But **if you do not sign**, then contract doesn’t apply — you get 1, other gets 1.

So you are **not worse off** in either case.

But if you sign, the other player gets **2** instead of 1.

So by signing, you **make the other player better off**, but **you stay at the same payoff**.

So there is **no incentive** to sign — you don’t gain anything.

But is there any **risk**?

Suppose you sign, but the other player **does not** sign.

Then contract does not apply → base game → both play A1 → you get 1

Same as if you didn’t sign.

So no risk.

But also no reward.

So signing has **expected payoff 1**, same as not signing.

So why would you sign?

There is no benefit.

But wait — in the contract game, even though you get only 1, **you could potentially get more if the other player misbehaves**?

But no — we assume both players are rational.

So outcome is fixed.

But here’s a deeper point: the contract **changes the game** in a way that makes A0 better for you.

But due to the fact that the **other player gets better payoff when they play A1**, they **still have incentive to deviate** from A0.

So you can’t exploit it.

Ultimately, **your payoff is 1 in both cases**.

So there is no reason to sign.

But wait — could there be a **mixed strategy** equilibrium in the contract game where you get more?

Suppose both players randomize.

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1−p.

Other plays A0 with q, A1 with 1−q.

Your expected payoff:

- If you play A0: 3q + 1(1−q) = 2q + 1
- If you play A1: 2q + 0(1−q) = 2q

So your best response: always play A0 (since 2q + 1 > 2q)

So **A0 is strictly dominant**

So you will play A0 with probability 1

Then other player’s best response: play A1 if they expect you to play A0

Because they get 2 (A1) vs 1 (A0)

So they play A1

So outcome is fixed: (A0, A1) → you get 1

So no mixed strategy improves this.

Therefore, **you cannot get more than 1**.

In the base game, you also get 1.

So **no difference**.

But here’s a catch: **in the base game, you **can’t** get more than 1 with rational play**.

Whereas in the contract game, **the only equilibrium gives you 1**, same as base.

So no gain.

But is there a possibility that by signing, you **prevent** the other player from getting an incentive to play A1?

No — in the base game, they play A1 anyway.

But wait — what if the contract **reduces the incentive to deviate**?

In the base game, when both might want to coordinate on A0, but **A1 is better for each**, so they don’t.

With the contract, if the other player thought you might play A0, they still want to play A1 to get 2.

So no coordination.

Thus, **your expected payoff is the same**.

So you should not sign — because you get nothing from it.

But you also don’t lose.

So is it rational to sign?

In game theory, if two actions give the same payoff, you are indifferent.

But here’s a key: the **contract requires both to sign**, and it’s **voluntary**.

So you **do not have to sign**.

And since signing gives you **no benefit**, and no cost, you are indifferent.

But the problem asks: **"Maximize your total points"**

Since both options give you 1, you are indifferent.

But is that true?

Wait — is there a **possibility** that by signing, you could get more?

Only if the other player could be induced to play A0.

But they won’t, because they get 1 from A0, 2 from A1 — so they prefer A1.

So no.

Alternatively, suppose the other player plays A0, then you get 3 — but they won’t play A0.

So no.

Thus, **you get 1 points in both cases**.

But let’s double-check the **base game**.

Is the equilibrium really (A1,A1)?

Yes, because A1 dominates A0.

So both play A1.

You get 1.

No other outcome.

In contract game: you get 1.

So same.

But now, consider: **if you sign, the other player wants to sign too**, because then they get 2 rather than 1.

But you still get 1.

So by signing, you **make the other player better off**, but you stay the same.

So **no benefit for you**.

Therefore, **signing is not beneficial**.

And since you are trying to **maximize your points**, and signing gives you **no gain**, you should **not sign**.

But wait — is there a risk of getting less?

Only if the other player signs and you don't? But then contract doesn't apply — you're fine.

If you sign and other doesn't — contract doesn't apply — you get 1 same as before.

So **no downside**.

But **no upside** either.

So you might as well not sign.

Perhaps the contract is designed to help the other player, but you are risk-neutral.

In such cases, since **expected payoff is the same**, and you have no interest in helping the other player (the problem is to **maximize your own points**), you should **not sign**.

Because signing **does not improve your payoff**, and might be seen as costly if you care about the other player, but the problem says "maximize your points", so only your payoff matters.

And since signing gives you the same payoff, you are indifferent.

But in such cases, the rational choice is to **not sign**, unless it's better.

But since it's not better, and costs you nothing, but gives nothing, you could sign or not.

But the safest is to not sign — because you don't need it.

But let’s think about **commitment**.

But no — you don’t need to commit.

Final decision: **signing gives you 1, not signing gives you 1** → no difference.

But **do you receive any benefit from signing**?

Only if the other player changes their strategy in a way that helps you.

But in this case, they still play A1, and you get 1.

So no.

But wait — in the base game, if both play A1, you get 1.

In the contract game, same.

So no.

But here’s a final point: **in the base game, if you played A0**, you’d get 0 if the other plays A1, or 2 if they play A0.

But since they play A1, you get 1.

In the contract game, if you play A0, you get 1 (from (0,3) +1 = 1), so same.

But you are not getting more.

Thus, **you should not sign**.

Because there is **no strategic advantage**, and the contract does not help you gain.

Moreover, the contract might make you worse off if the other player is not rational — but we assume rationality.

So with rational players, it doesn't change the outcome.

Thus, **signing is not beneficial**.

---

### Conclusion:

- Signing the contract does not increase your expected payoff.
- Your payoff is 1 in all scenarios.
- Since there is no benefit, and the contract might involve moral hazard or other costs (though not specified), and since the goal is to maximize your points, you should not sign.

**Final answer: do not sign**

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):

response:
To maximize my expected points, I compare my payoffs for each possible action of Player 1:

- If Player 1 plays **A0**:
  - My payoff with **A0** = 2
  - My payoff with **A1** = 3  
  ⇒ **A1 is better**.

- If Player 1 plays **A1**:
  - My payoff with **A0** = 0
  - My payoff with **A1** = 1  
  ⇒ **A1 is better**.

So **A1 strictly dominates A0** (it yields a higher payoff no matter what Player 1 does). Therefore I should put all probability on **A1**.

Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without the Contract**

We're playing a simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Payoff | Opponent's Payoff |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0         | A0                | 2           | 2                 |
| A0         | A1                | 0           | 3                 |
| A1         | A0                | 3           | 0                 |
| A1         | A1                | 1           | 1                 |

This is a classic 2x2 game. Let’s analyze it to find the Nash equilibrium (or optimal strategy for maximizing expected payoff under rational play).

We are Player 1 (you), and the opponent is Player 2.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability you play A0 (so $ 1-p $ = probability you play A1)
- $ q $ = probability player 2 plays A0 (so $ 1-q $ = probability player 2 plays A1)

You want to choose $ p $ to maximize your expected payoff, assuming the opponent will choose $ q $ optimally.

But since we are deciding **your** strategy **without knowing** what the other player will do, we assume rational behavior. The best strategy is often a **mixed Nash equilibrium**, where each player randomizes in such a way that the other player is indifferent between their actions.

---

### **Step 2: Find the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**

Let’s compute the expected payoff for Player 1 given the opponent plays $ q $.

**Player 1’s expected payoff when playing A0:**
$$
E(A0) = q \cdot 2 + (1 - q) \cdot 0 = 2q
$$

**Player 1’s expected payoff when playing A1:**
$$
E(A1) = q \cdot 3 + (1 - q) \cdot 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1
$$

Now, set $ E(A0) = E(A1) $ to make the opponent indifferent (if we want them to be willing to mix), but wait—actually, we want to find a strategy for **yourself** that is a best response to the opponent’s best response.

But let's flip perspective: find the $ q $ such that Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1. That will help us find the opponent’s equilibrium strategy.

Set $ E(A0) = E(A1) $ from **Player 1’s perspective**:

$$
2q = 2q + 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0 = 1
$$

This is impossible → no q makes Player 1 indifferent. So instead, we can analyze **Player 2’s** incentives.

We look for a value of $ q $ (Player 2’s mix) such that **Player 1** is indifferent between A0 and A1. That is:

$$
2q = 2q + 1 \quad \text{(No solution)}
$$

Wait—that can't be. Let’s double-check.

Wait: if **you** choose A0, your payoff is:
- 2 if opponent plays A0
- 0 if opponent plays A1

So $ E_{A0} = 2q + 0(1-q) = 2q $

If **you** choose A1:
- 3 if opponent plays A0
- 1 if opponent plays A1

So $ E_{A1} = 3q + 1(1 - q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1 $

So:
- $ E(A0) = 2q $
- $ E(A1) = 2q + 1 $

So **for all q**, $ E(A1) > E(A0) $, since $ 2q + 1 > 2q $

That means: **no matter what q is, A1 gives you strictly higher expected payoff than A0**.

Therefore, **your best response to any strategy of the opponent is to play A1 with probability 1**.

But wait—is that really true?

Let’s verify with examples:

- If q = 0: opponent always plays A1
  - A0: you get 0
  - A1: you get 1 → better
- If q = 1: opponent always plays A0
  - A0: you get 2
  - A1: you get 3 → better
- If q = 0.5:
  - A0: 2×0.5 = 1
  - A1: 2×0.5 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 → still better

So yes, **A1 strictly dominates A0** for Player 1.

So your best strategy is to play A1 with 100% probability.

But wait—what about **Player 2’s** incentives?

Let’s analyze Player 2’s expected payoff from their own perspective (just to verify equilibrium).

Suppose you play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1-p.

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If Player 2 plays A0: $ p \cdot 2 + (1-p) \cdot 0 = 2p $
- If Player 2 plays A1: $ p \cdot 3 + (1-p) \cdot 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1 $

So again, $ E(A1) = 2p + 1 > 2p = E(A0) $: A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2 as well.

So both players have a **strict dominance** of A1 over A0.

Therefore, the **only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**: both play A1.

In this case, your payoff is 1, and opponent’s is 1.

But can you do better?

Wait: no. Since A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players, rational players will always choose A1.

So the expected outcome is (A1, A1), giving you 1 point.

But is there any incentive to deviate?

No — because if you play A0, you get 0 when the other plays A1 (which they always will), so you get 0, worse than 1.

Similarly, if you play A1 and they play A1, you get 1.

So **playing A1 with probability 100%** is the rational, dominant strategy.

Even though the symmetric equilibrium pays 1, that’s the best you can do given rational play.

There is no mixed strategy that improves your expected payoff if the opponent is rational.

In fact, since A1 dominates A0, **you should never play A0 at all**, no matter what.

Therefore, the optimal probability distribution is:

- A0: 0%
- A1: 100%

---

### **Step 3: Consider the Contract (But It’s Not Active)**

The twist mentions a proposed contract:
- If you play A0 → get +1 point, paid equally by others
- If you play A1 → pay -1 point, shared by others

But it was **rejected by Player 1**, which is **you**.

So the contract is **not active**, and does **not apply**.

You are playing the **original game**.

So you can ignore the contract.

Therefore, the contract does **not** change your strategy.

---

### **Conclusion**

Since A1 strictly dominates A0 for you, and both players are assumed to be rational (as is standard in such games), the only rational choice is to play A1 with 100% probability.

Thus, your best response strategy is to set:

- A0: 0%
- A1: 100%

Let's go step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contracts)**

We have a simultaneous two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2) is:

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

This looks like a **modified version of the Prisoner’s Dilemma**, but let’s analyze the dominant strategies.

- For Player 1:
  - If Player 2 plays A0: Player 1 gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1
  - If Player 2 plays A1: Player 1 gets 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A1
  → **A1 is dominant for Player 1**

- For Player 2:
  - If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1
  - If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 0 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A1
  → **A1 is dominant for Player 2**

So, **(A1, A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium in the base game.

Expected payoff at equilibrium: (1, 1)

But note: (A0, A0) gives (2,2), which is *better for both players*. However, it's not stable because each player has an incentive to deviate.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract mechanism**

A **contract** can be proposed and then **approved via approval voting**. The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

We are **Player 1**, and we must choose whether to **approve** or **disapprove** each proposed contract.

> **Crucial point:** The contract modifies the payoffs **in addition to** the base game.

So we need to evaluate how each contract **alters the incentives**, and whether **it increases our expected payoff**, **especially considering that the other player may also have incentives to approve**.

But since we are choosing **only our own approval**, we must ask: **"Would I want this contract to be implemented?"**, assuming it might be chosen.

We are not voting based on what’s best for the other player; we want to **maximize our own total points**.

Also, **only one contract will be chosen**, and it will be **chosen uniformly at random** from those with the **most approvals**.

So, the strategy is to **approve contracts that you believe increase your expected payoff**, and **do not approve** ones that hurt you or give you no benefit.

We need to evaluate:

- What is the **effective payoff** under each contract?
- How does it change the Nash equilibrium?
- Does it make coordination on a better outcome (like A0,A0) more likely?
- What is the **impact on your own expected payoff**, given that both players choose strategies after the contract is applied?

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> **C1 (Player 1’s proposal):**
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, **drawn equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

Let’s break it down.

Suppose a player plays A0 → they get +1 point, and the other player **loses 1 point** (because the +1 is drawn from them).

So for a given player:

- Playing A0: gain +1 from contract
- Playing A1: no change

But the cost of giving +1 to A0 players is **borne by the other player(s)**.

So the **total effect** on the game:
- Whenever a player plays A0, they get +1, and the other player loses 1 (if they play something else, or if both play A0, the extra 1 for A0 is “paid” by the other, but since it’s “drawn equally”, we must be careful).

Wait: “drawn equally from the other players” — so if **you** play A0, you get +1, and the **other player(ies)** each lose 1 (if only one other player, then they lose 1).

So in this two-player game:
- If you play A0, you gain +1; the other player loses 1.
- If you play A1, nothing changes.

Thus, the **net effect** is:
- You gain +1 for playing A0
- The other player loses 1 for playing A0 (i.e., if the other plays A0, they lose 1)

So let’s recompute the **modified payoff matrix** under C1.

Let’s define the **total payoff** = base payoff + contract bonus.

For Player 1 (us), when we play:
- A0: +1 point from contract
- A1: 0 extra

For Player 2:
- A0: +1 point from contract
- A1: 0 extra

Therefore, the **new payoff matrix** (Player 1, Player 2) becomes:

|           | P2: A0 (+1)     | P2: A1          |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| **P1: A0 (+1)** | (2 + 1, 2 + 1) = (3,3) | (0 + 1, 3 + 0) = (1,3) |
| **P1: A1 (0)**  | (3 + 0, 0 + 1) = (3,1) | (1 + 0, 1 + 0) = (1,1) |

So the modified matrix is:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (3,3) | (1,3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3,1) | (1,1) |

Now, what is Player 1’s best response?

- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3 (A0) or 3 (A1) → indifferent
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) or 1 (A1) → indifferent

So **A0 and A1 are both best responses**, depending on P2's strategy.

But check: **A0 is no worse (and strictly better if P2 plays A0)**.

Let’s find best responses more carefully.

For P1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

→ So **any strategy is best response**.

But now consider **strict incentive**.

Wait — actually, **A0 is weakly better** only in A0-A0, but in A1-A1, same.

But look: **if the other player plays A0**, then you get **3** whether you play A0 or A1. So indifferent.

But if the other plays A1, you get **1** either way.

So **no incentive to deviate** from anything.

But now, **Player 2**’s incentives:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 3      | 3      |
| **P1: A1** | 1      | 1      |

For P2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

→ So **also indifferent** in both cases.

So **both players are indifferent** between A0 and A1, regardless of what the other does.

That means **any strategy is a best response**.

But now, **what are the possible equilibria?**

Any mixture is a Nash equilibrium. But what outcome is likely?

However, note: **(A0, A0)** is now (3,3), which is better than (3,1), (1,3), or (1,1).

But also, **(A0, A0)** is **strictly better** than (A1, A0) **for both players**?

Wait: (A0,A0) = (3,3)  
(A1,A0) = (3,1) → P1 same, P2 worse → P2 would not want to play A0

Similarly, (A0,A1) = (1,3) → P1 worse, P2 better → P1 would not want to play A0

So **only (A0,A0)** gives **both players maximum payoff**.

And since **players are indifferent**, but **(A0,A0) is a Pareto-dominant outcome**, and both players **benefit from coordinating on A0**, it's likely to be chosen in practice — especially since both get the same payoff from both actions in all cases.

But actually, the key is that **now both players have positive incentive to play A0**.

Wait — let’s re-express the **marginal gain** from playing A0.

- **For Player 1:** Playing A0 gives +1 extra (contract), regardless of what Player 2 does.
  - But if you play A0, you get +1
  - But if the other player plays A0, they also get +1, so **you don’t lose anything** to that.

- However, **you gain +1 regardless** of what the other does, **if you play A0**.

Yes! The contract gives you +1 **if you play A0**, and the cost is paid **by the other player** if they play A0.

So:  
- If I play A0 → I gain +1
- If the other plays A0 → they lose 1 (so I benefit indirectly by the other losing 1)

But actually, **this is a transfer**: when I play A0, I get +1; the other player loses 1 **if they are playing A0**.

But if they play A1, they don’t lose anything.

So for **me**, playing A0 gives me **+1 for sure**, regardless of the other player’s action.

Because:
- The extra 1 from the contract is **given to me** if I play A0.
- The cost of that 1 is **borne by the other player only if they play A0**.

But since **I'm getting +1 no matter what**, and **I don't suffer any loss** from their actions — in fact, if they play A1, I get the +1 and they don’t lose anything → I get +1 and they get same as before.

So **playing A0 gives me +1 no matter what the other player does.**

Similarly, for the other player: **playing A0 gives them +1 no matter what**.

So **A0 is a dominant strategy for both players** under C1!

Yes! Because:
- For Player 1: playing A0 → +1, regardless of P2
- Playing A1 → 0 extra
→ So **A0 is strictly better** for me, regardless of what P2 does.

Same for Player 2: A0 gives them +1, A1 gives 0 → A0 is strictly better.

Therefore, **(A0, A0) will be played** as the unique equilibrium.

Then, **payoffs will be**:
- Base: (2,2)
- Contract: both get +1
→ Total: (3,3)

So **my payoff is 3** — **an improvement over the base game (1)**.

So **C1 is very good for me**.

And since it's **self-improving** (I want it), and **induces cooperation**, I should **approve it**.

But wait: **C1 is proposed by me** — so I would want to approve my own proposal? Yes.

But could there be a situation where approving C1 hurts me?

Only if I think the contract might not be implemented, or if the other player might veto it — but we are asked to approve or not based on whether **we want it** to be implemented.

And we **do** — because it gives us **3 points** for sure.

So, **approve C1** → **true**

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> **C2 (Player 2’s proposal):**
> - If a player chooses A0, there is **no additional payments**.
> - If a player chooses A1, they **pay an additional 1 point**, distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If you play A1 → you **lose 1 point**
- If you play A0 → nothing changes

Note: "distributed equally among the other players" — so if there is one other player, they get +1, and you lose 1.

So the **cost of playing A1 is 1 point**, paid to the other player.

So in the game, for Player 1:
- Playing A1: lose 1 point (contract cost)
- Playing A0: no change

For Player 2:
- Playing A1: lose 1 point
- Playing A0: no change

So the **modified payoff matrix** is:

|           | P2: A0       | P2: A1 (loses 1) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **P1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3 - 1) = (0,2) |
| **P1: A1** | (3 - 1, 0) = (2,0) | (1 - 1, 1 - 1) = (0,0) |

So let's write it clearly:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (2,2) | (0,2) |
| **P1: A1** | (2,0) | (0,0) |

Now analyze incentives.

For **Player 1**:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → indifferent
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → indifferent

→ So indifferent in both cases.

But **A0 is weakly better in some cases**? No, only equal.

Wait: if P2 plays A0, both give 2.

If P2 plays A1, both give 0.

So **no strict incentive**.

But now, **Player 2**'s incentives:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → indifferent
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → indifferent

So again, **no strict incentive**, but:

Let’s check if **A0 is a best response**.

Yes — no matter what, both actions give same payoff.

But now look at outcomes:
- (A0,A0): (2,2)
- (A0,A1): (0,2)
- (A1,A0): (2,0)
- (A1,A1): (0,0)

Now, **(A0,A0)** gives both (2,2), which is **better than other outcomes**.

But is it sustainable? Only if both players coordinate on A0.

But now, **A1 has a cost** — **it costs you 1 point**.

So if you play A1, you **lose 1**, regardless.

So **A1 is worse** than A0 **in all cases**, because:
- Against A0: A1 gives 2 (if you are P1), same as A0 → equal
- Against A1: both give 0 → equal

But now, the **only difference is that A1 is not worse**, but **not better**.

But actually, **A0 gives same or better payoff**:

For Player 1:
- A0 vs A1: same or better?
  - If P2 plays A0: both give 2 → tie
  - If P2 plays A1: both give 0 → tie

Wait — **no difference**!

So actually, **the contract does not change the relative payoff between A0 and A1** for either player — only the **absolute levels**.

But now observe: **playing A1 costs 1 point**, but **in the base game**, A1 was already better or equal.

Let’s see.

In base game:
- P1: A1 vs A0: 3 > 2 (if P2 A0), 1 > 0 (if P2 A1) → A1 strictly better

But now:
- P1: A1 gives 2 vs 2 (P2 A0), 0 vs 0 (P2 A1) → so A1 is **not better**, just equal!

So **now A1 is not a best response**.

Instead, A0 is **weakly better** in both cases.

Wait:

- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → same → so A0 is best (weakly)
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → same

So **A0 is always at least as good as A1**, and strictly better only if P2 plays A0 — but wait, no, same.

But **A0 is not strictly better**.

But now, **is A1 still a best response?** No, because it gives **same or worse**.

Wait: same in both cases → so **A0 and A1 are both best responses**, but A0 is not strictly better.

But now, **since A1 costs you 1 point**, and otherwise same payoff, **A0 is weakly dominant**?

No: weakly — same payoff.

But **A0 is at least as good as A1**, and **A1 is not better**.

So **A0 is a best response**, **A1 is not** (unless we allow indifference).

But in equilibrium, **any mixture** can be played.

But now, **what is the likely outcome?**

(A0, A0) gives (2,2), which is better than (A1,A0) = (2,0), (A0,A1) = (0,2), (A1,A1) = (0,0).

So **(A0,A0)** is Pareto-dominant.

And since **both players get the same payoff from A0 as A1 in each case**, but **A1 has a cost**, they might **prefer A0** to avoid the cost.

But **A1 gives same payoff**, so they are indifferent.

However, **if a player thinks the other will play A0**, then:
- A0 gives 2
- A1 gives 2 → so same

So **no incentive to deviate**.

But now, **if a player is risk-averse or wants to avoid costs**, they might prefer A0.

But in game theory, with indifference, the outcome could be **anything**.

But here’s the key: **C2 changes the game to make A1 less attractive** by imposing a cost.

But **for me (Player 1)**, what is my outcome?

- If both play A0: I get 2
- If both play A1: I get 0
- If mixed: depends

But **in base game, I got 1**.

Under C2, **if a mixed equilibrium is played**, I might get less.

But **can I expect (A0,A0)**?

Only if both players coordinate on A0.

But since the other player (P2) is the **proposer**, they might be **motivated to get a better outcome**, but **I am not sure**.

But **C2 is proposed by Player 2**.

Player 2 wants this to pass — so they **approve** it.

But **what do I get**?

- If (A0,A0): I get 2
- If (A0,A1): I get 0
- If (A1,A0): I get 2
- If (A1,A1): I get 0

So the **expected payoff depends on what the other player does**.

But **in equilibrium**, what happens?

- For Player 1: A0 and A1 are equally good, **but playing A1 costs 1 point**, so **any deviation to A1 gives no better payoff**, and costs 1.

But since **you get same payoff**, you might as well play A0 to avoid the risk or the cost.

But **no rational reason not to play A1**.

But if **both players are rational and symmetric**, they might **both play A0** to get (2,2), since it’s better.

But **is (A0,A0) an equilibrium?** Yes.

- P1: if P2 plays A0, I get 2 (A0) or 2 (A1) → so **A0 is best response**
- Similarly, P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 2 (A0) or 2 (A1) → A0 best response
→ So **(A0,A0) is an equilibrium**

But also, **(A1,A1) is an equilibrium**?

- P1: if P2 plays A1 → I get 0 (A0) or 0 (A1) → both same → so A1 is best response.
- P2: same → so yes, **(A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium**

So now there are **multiple equilibria**: (A0,A0), (A1,A1), and mixed.

But **(A0,A0)** gives 2 to me.

**(A1,A1)** gives 0 to me.

So I **prefer (A0,A0)**.

But **will it be played?**

That depends on **focal points** or **coordination**.

But since **(A0,A0)** is better, and both players know it, and since **no one has incentive to deviate**, it's likely.

But **is it guaranteed?** Probably not.

But now, **what is the **expected** payoff for me if C2 is implemented?**

It could be **2**, **0**, or in between.

But **in the base game**, I got 1.

Under C2, I get **2 if (A0,A0)**, **0 if (A1,A1)**.

Since both are equilibria, and **no way to enforce coordination**, I might get **0**, or **2**.

But since **A1 has a cost**, and **no benefit**, rational players might avoid it.

In fact, **A1 is weakly dominated**? Let's see.

Is A1 weakly dominated by A0?

For Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 2 → same
- If P2 plays A1: A0 gives 0, A1 gives 0 → same

So **A0 is weakly dominant** (same or better, and equal in all cases).

So **A0 weakly dominates A1**.

Similarly for P2.

Therefore, **rational players will never play A1**, because A0 gives same payoff **and avoids the cost** (though no cost in payoff).

In game theory, if **A0 weakly dominates A1**, then **rational players will choose A0**.

So **(A0,A0) is the outcome we should expect**.

Thus, **under C2**, the **equilibrium outcome is (A0,A0)** → **I get 2 points**.

But in the base game, I get **1 point**.

So I get **2** under C2 → **better than base**.

And the contract **is good for me**.

So **should I approve C2?**

Yes — it gives me **2 points**, better than **1** in the base game.

But wait: **C2 is proposed by Player 2** — and **costs Player 1**? No.

Look:

- When **I play A1**, I lose 1 point — but under C2, I play A0, so I don't pay.

- And **I don’t pay the cost** — the cost is paid by the one who plays A1.

So if I play A0, I get **no cost**, and **get the base payoff**.

So yes, I get **2 if both play A0**.

And we expect that.

So C2 is **good for me**.

But wait: **is there a problem?**

The contract says: **"if a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point"**.

But **I am not playing A1**, so I don’t pay.

And **I get the same base payoff**, but now the outcome is **(A0,A0)** instead of **(A1,A1)**.

So **I benefit**.

But what about **Player 2**?

- They proposed it, so they want it.

- But under C2, **if both play A0**, they get 2.

- In base game, they get 2 if (A0,A0), or 1 if (A1,A1), or 3 if (A0,A1).

But now, **(A0,A1)** gives P2: 2 (but P1 gets 0), and **P1 gets 0**, which is bad.

But since **P1 will play A0**, and both prefer (A0,A0), **(A0,A0) is likely**.

So P2 also gets **2**, which is **better than 1**.

So **C2 benefits both players**.

But **why would I approve C2**?

Because it gives me **2, which is better than 1**.

But **C1 gives me 3**, which is even better.

So **C1 is better than C2**.

But the question is not “which is better”, but “which do I approve”.

I should approve **any contract that benefits me**, or at least doesn’t hurt me.

But **could there be a problem with C2?**

One concern: **if the other player plays A1**, I get 0.

But under C2, **A1 is dominated**, so I expect **no one plays A1**.

Similarly, under C1, **A0 is dominant**, so (A0,A0) happens.

So both contracts lead to **better outcome** than base game.

**C1 gives me 3**, **C2 gives me 2**.

So **I prefer C1**.

But **if I approve C2**, and C1 is also approved, and **C1 gets more approvals**, then C1 is chosen — so **I get 3**.

But if I **don’t approve C2**, and C1 gets 1 approval (from me), then **C1 may not be chosen** if no other approvals.

But **C2 is proposed by P2**, so **P2 will approve it**.

So:
- C1: I approve → 1 approval
- C2: P2 approves → 1 approval (and I may approve or not)

Now, **if I approve both**, then **both have 1 approval each**, so **randomly pick one** → I might get C1 (3 points) or C2 (2 points) — average 2.5 points.

But if I **only approve C1**, and P2 approves C2, then:
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 1 approval
→ same.

But **if I don’t approve C2**, and P2 does, then **C1 has 1**, **C2 has 1** → still random.

But if **I approve both**, then both have **2 approvals**? No.

Wait: only I and P2 are players.

So total approvals possible: 2.

If I approve C1 and C2, then:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 1 approval (from P2)

So C1 wins → I get 3 points.

If I approve C1 only:
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 1 approval
→ random winner → with 50% chance I get 3, 50% get 2 → expected 2.5

If I approve C2 only:
- C1: 0 approvals
- C2: 2 approvals → C2 wins → I get 2

If I approve neither:
- both have 1 approval → random → expected 2.5

So **best choice** is to **approve both** — then **C1 wins** for sure → I get 3.

But **is that allowed?** Yes — we are allowed to approve multiple contracts.

But the question is: **should I approve C2?**

From **self-interest**: **yes, because it increases my chance of getting a good outcome**.

But **if I approve C2**, and **C1 is approved by P2?** No — C1 is proposed by me, so I am the only one who can approve it.

Wait: do **both players** approve contracts?

Yes — each player votes on each contract.

But only **one contract** is selected — the one with **maximum number of approvals**, chosen uniformly at random.

So for C1: if **I approve**, and **P2 approves**, then 2 approvals.

For C2: if **P2 approves**, and **I approve**, then 2 approvals.

But **P2 will approve C2** (since it's their proposal).

But **will P2 approve C1?**

C1: if implemented, P2 gets 3 points → **better than 2 or 1**, so **P2 will approve C1**.

Similarly, C2: P2 gets 2 points under (A0,A0), which is better than 1, so **P2 will approve C2**.

So **P2 will approve both contracts**.

Now, if **I approve both**, then:
- C1: 2 approvals (me and P2)
- C2: 2 approvals (me and P2)
→ both have max approvals → **randomly choose one** → 50% chance C1 (3 points), 50% chance C2 (2 points) → **expected 2.5**

But if I **approve only C1**, then:
- C1: 1 approval (me)
- C2: 2 approvals (P2)
→ C2 wins → I get 2 points

If I approve only C2: C2 wins → I get 2

If I approve neither: C2 wins (2 approvals), so I get 2

So **the best I can do is 2.5** if I approve both.

But **can I expect to get more than that?**

No — because if I approve both, **random winner**, 2.5 expected.

But **if I approve only C1**, then **C2 wins** → I get 2.

Worse.

So **I should approve both** — because it gives **2.5 expected points**.

But wait: **is there a way to make C1 win with 100% probability**?

Only if I **approve C1**, and **P2 does not approve C2**.

But **P2 will approve C2**, because it gives them **2 points**, which is better than 1.

Similarly, P2 will approve C1, which gives them **3 points** → even better.

So P2 will **approve both**.

So **C1 has at least 1 approval**, C2 has at least 1.

If I approve both, both have 2 → random.

If I approve only C1, C2 has 2 → wins.

So **I cannot force C1 to win**.

The **only way to get 3 points** is if **C1 wins**.

But to make C1 win, it must have **more approvals than C2**.

But if I approve C1 and not C2, then C1:1, C2:2 → C2 wins.

If I approve both, C1:2, C2:2 → random.

So **I cannot ensure C1 wins**.

But I can **maximize my expected payoff**.

- Approve both: expected 2.5
- Approve only C1: 2
- Approve only C2: 2
- Approve neither: 2

So **best is to approve both**.

But the question is: **should I approve C2?**

Yes — because **even though it gives me only 2**, it **gives me 2.5 expected**, and I get at least 2.

And **if I don’t approve it, I get only 2**.

So **I should approve C2**.

But wait — **what if the other player doesn’t approve C1?**

But P2 will approve C1 — because it gives them 3 points.

Similarly, they approve C2 → 2 points.

So both are good for P2.

Therefore, **both contracts will be approved by P2**.

So the **only choice I have** is:

- If I approve both: C1 and C2 both have 2 approvals → random → I get 3 or 2 → expected 2.5
- If I approve only C1: C2 has 2 approvals → wins → I get 2
- If I approve only C2: C2 wins → I get 2
- If I approve none: C2 wins → I get 2

So **only by approving both** do I get **2.5 expected**.

Therefore, **I should approve both**.

But is this right?

But let me double-check: **if I approve both**, and **C2 is implemented**, I get 2.

But under C2, I get **2 points**.

Under C1, I get 3.

But **C2 is not as good as C1**.

But to **increase my chances of getting the better contract**, I **must vote for both**.

And since **P2 will vote for both anyway**, **voting for both maximizes the chance that at least one good contract is chosen**, and in this case, **since C1 is better, I want it to be chosen**, but I cannot ensure it.

So **approval of C2 is beneficial**.

But wait: **is there any scenario where C2 hurts me?**

Only if it leads to **(A1,A1)**, but as we analyzed, under C2, **A0 weakly dominates A1**, so **(A0,A0)** is the only sensible equilibrium.

So **C2 gives me 2 for sure**.

So **no downside**.

Therefore, **I should approve both contracts**.

But earlier I said C1 gives 3, C2 gives 2 — both good.

But the question is to **approve**.

So final decision:

- Approve C1: **true**
- Approve C2: **true**

But is that consistent?

Wait — let's confirm one thing.

The **contract is a modification of the game** — the **payoffs are changed** when the contract is in place.

So if **C1 is implemented**, I get **3**.

If **C2 is implemented**, I get **2**.

And **P2 will approve both**.

If I approve both, **both have 2 approvals**, so **random choice** — I get **3 with 50% chance**, **2 with 50%**.

But **if I do not approve C2**, then C2 has only 1 approval, C1 has 1 — so **also random**, same expected.

But **if I approve only C1**, then C1:1, C2:2 → C2 wins → I get 2.

Oh! **Mistake!**

If I **approve only C1**, then:
- C1: 1 approval (me)
- C2: 2 approvals (P2)
→ C2 wins with probability 1 → I get 2

But if I **approve both**, then C1:2, C2:2 → random → expected 2.5

So **I must approve both** to get expected 2.5

If I approve only C1, I get 2

So **best to approve both**

Yes.

Therefore, **approve both**

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0      2, 2      0, 3
P2: A1      3, 0      1, 1
```

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma where A1 dominates A0 for both players, leading to Nash equilibrium at (A1, A1) with payoff of 1 for each player.

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs under Contract 1

Contract 1: Choosing A0 gives +1 point from the other player

```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0      2, 2      1, 2
P2: A1      2, 1      1, 1
```

- (A0, A0): I get 2+1-1=2, P1 gets 2+1-1=2
- (A0, A1): I get 0+1=1, P1 gets 3-1=2
- (A1, A0): I get 3-1=2, P1 gets 0+1=1
- (A1, A1): I get 1, P1 gets 1

Under this contract, I'm indifferent between A0 and A1 regardless of what P1 does. P1 also becomes mostly indifferent. Multiple Nash equilibria exist, but (A0, A0) is Pareto optimal, giving me **2 points**.

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs under Contract 2

Contract 2: Choosing A1 costs -2 points paid to the other player

```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0      2, 2      2, 1
P2: A1      1, 2      1, 1
```

- (A0, A0): I get 2, P1 gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0+2=2, P1 gets 3-2=1
- (A1, A0): I get 3-2=1, P1 gets 0+2=2
- (A1, A1): I get 1, P1 gets 1

Under this contract, A0 strictly dominates A1 for me! The unique Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0), giving me **2 points**.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- No contract: **1 point** (from Nash equilibrium A1, A1)
- Contract 1: **2 points** (from coordination on A0, A0)
- Contract 2: **2 points** (from dominant strategy equilibrium A0, A0)

Both contracts improve my payoff from 1 to 2 points. Contract 2 is slightly safer since it makes A0 my dominant strategy, but both lead to the same expected outcome under rational play.

## Conclusion

Both contracts are strictly better for me than no contract, and both yield the same expected payoff. I should approve both to maximize the probability that some beneficial contract is implemented.

Let's go step by step to determine which contracts to approve.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

This is a **symmetric two-player game** with the following payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff first):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (2,2)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (1,1)  |

Let’s analyze the **Nash equilibria** of this base game.

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria:
- (A0, A0): If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 2 vs 3 if switching to A1 → so P2 would deviate → Not NE.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, but if P1 switches to A1, gets 1 → so P1 deviates → Not NE.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3, but if P2 switches to A1, gets 3 vs 0 → P2 deviates → Not NE.
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 1; if P1 switches to A0, gets 0 → no incentive. P2 same → so **(PIP: (A1, A1) is a pure NE**.

Now check for mixed strategies.

Let:
- P1 plays A0 with probability `p`
- P2 plays A0 with probability `q`

For P1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- Expected payoff from A0: `2q + 0(1-q) = 2q`
- Expected payoff from A1: `3(1-q) + 1*q = 3 - 3q + q = 3 - 2q`

Set equal:  
2q = 3 - 2q → 4q = 3 → q = 3/4

Similarly, for P2 to be indifferent:
- P2's payoff from A0: `2p + 0(1-p) = 2p`
- P2's payoff from A1: `3(1-p) + 1*p = 3 - 3p + p = 3 - 2p`

Set equal:  
2p = 3 - 2p → 4p = 3 → p = 3/4

So there is a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** where both play A0 with 3/4 probability.

Thus, possible equilibria:
- Pure: (A1, A1)
- Mixed: (3/4 A0, 1/4 A1) for both

Now, which equilibrium is **more likely in practice**?

But in this game, **A1 is a dominant strategy** **for neither player**, but:
- A1 is better than A0 when the other plays A0 → (3 > 2)
- A0 is better than A1 when the other plays A1 → (0 < 3), so better to play A0

So no dominant strategy.

But notice: **(A1, A1)** gives both 1 point. (A0, A0) gives both 2. So (A0, A0) is better for both, but unstable.

But in equilibrium, players tend to play (A1, A1) or mix.

But we don't know what the other player will do. So we need to think **strategically**.

But importantly: **We are Player 1**, and we are **choosing whether to approve contracts** with the goal of **maximizing our expected points**.

The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.

So our approval decision can influence which contract wins.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

There are **two contracts proposed**, one by each player.

We are to decide whether to approve **C1** (Player 1's contract) and **C2** (Player 2's contract).

Note: The contract **only applies if both players agree** — but in this system, it's **approval voting**. The contract is enacted only if **approved by at least one player**? Wait — the note says:

> "The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

That means: multiple contracts can be approved, and **any contract that receives the maximum number of approvals** is eligible. Then **one is chosen uniformly at random**.

So the **number of approvals** is key.

Our goal is **not just to approve a contract that benefits us**, but to **maximize expected points in the final outcome** — which depends on:
- Which contract is selected (randomly from max-approved contracts)
- How players play under that contract

So we need to analyze **how each contract alters incentives** and **what outcomes are likely** under each.

---

### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Let’s understand this.

This means:
- If you play A0 → you get +1 point
- But this +1 is **drawn equally from the other players**

So: if there are two players, and Player 1 plays A0, Player 1 gets +1, and **Player 2 loses 1 point** (since "drawn equally from the other players" — only one other player).

Similarly, if **Player 2 plays A0**, Player 2 gets +1, and Player 1 loses 1.

So effectively:
- Playing A  A0 yields **+1** extra payment for the player, **-1** for the opponent.

This **changes the payoff matrix**.

Let’s write the **new payoff matrix** under C1.

Note: Payoffs now include the contract payment.

We'll write (P1’s total payoff, P2’s total payoff) for each combination.

---

#### Case 1: P1 A0, P2 A0  
- Base: (2,2)  
- P1 plays A0 → gets +1  
- P2 plays A0 → gets +1  
→ **(3,3)**

#### Case 2: P1 A0, P2 A1  
- Base: (0,3)  
- P1 plays A0 → gets +1  
- P2
→ P1: 0 + 1 = 1  
→ P2 plays A1 → no payment  
→ P2: 3  
→ **(1,3)**

#### Case 3: P1 A1, P2 A0  
- Base: (3,0)  
- P1 plays A1 → no payment  
- P2 plays A0 → gets +1  
→ P1: 3  
→ P2: 0 + 1 = 1  
→ **(3,1)**

#### Case 4: P1 A1, P2 A1  
- Base: (1,1)  
- No one plays A0 → no extra payments  
→ **(1,1)**

So the **new C1 payoff matrix** is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (3,3)  | (1,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,1)  | (1,1)  |

Now, let’s find Nash equilibria under C1.

- For P1:
  - If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent
  - If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

So P1 is **indifferent** between A0 and A1 **no matter what P2 does**.

But wait — actually, if P2 plays A0, both give 3 → indifferent.  
If P2 plays A1, both give 1 → still indifferent.

So P1 is **always indifferent**.

Now P2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → indifferent
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

So P2 is **also indifferent** in every case.

So **every strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium** under C1? Not really — but since **both players are indifferent between A0 and A1 regardless of opponent**, the **game is degenerate**.

But more importantly: **A0 gives no worse payoff than A1, and sometimes better**.

Wait: in fact, **A0 dominates A1** for both players?

No: in all cases, both A0 and A1 give the same payoff.

Let’s verify:

- When P2 plays A0:
  - P1: A0 → 3, A1 → 3 → equal
- When P2 plays A1:
  - P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → equal

Similarly for P2.

So **no incentive to deviate** — but no unique best response.

But notice: **playing A0 gives same payoff as A1**, so **there is no disadvantage to playing A0**. But there’s **no advantage either**.

But in a symmetric game where both are indifferent, **a rational player might still prefer A0 if they expect the other to play A0**, because then both during!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...... (This is going off track.)

Actually: since both actions give same payoff, **any mixture is a NE**.

But importantly: **under C1, both players are indifferent between A0 and A1**.

But what outcome is likely?

Since both players get the same payoff from A0 and A1 **no matter what the other does**, it's **rational to randomize**, or even to stick with a default.

But there's **no inherent incentive toward A0 or A1**.

But note: in **(A0, A0)**, both get 3 — best possible total payoff.

In **(A0, A1)** or **(A1, A0)**, both get 1 or 3 — but mixed.

But since **both players are indifferent**, **they might coordinate on A0**, because it's the best outcome, and both can benefit.

But without communication, it's uncertain.

But in this contract, **(A0, A0)** is a Nash equilibrium, and it gives the **highest payoff for both**.

Moreover, **every profile is a NE**, so **(A0, A0)** is possible.

Also, **(A1, A1)** gives only 1 each — worse.

So **if both players are rational and cooperative**, they would **both prefer to choose A0** under C1, because it gives 3 each.

But will they?

Since they are indifferent, **they might choose A0** if they believe the other will.

But since this is a **symmetric game with a dominant coordination point (A0, A0)**, and **no downside to playing A0**, **we can reasonably expect (A0, A0)** to emerge in practice.

So under C1, **expected payoff is likely close to (3,3)**.

Let’s assume **high probability of (A0,A0)** → so **P1’s expected payoff ≈ 3**

Now: **what if only one player approves C1?**

But we are deciding whether to **approve** it.

Let’s hold that thought.

---

### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If you play A1 → you lose 2 points
- The other player gains 2 points

(Only one other player, so the 2 points go to them entirely.)

So this is a **penalty for playing A1**.

Let’s update the payoff matrix.

#### Case 1: P1 A0, P2 A0  
- Base: (2,2)
- No one plays A1 → no penalty
→ **(2,2)**

#### Case 2: P1 A0, P2 A1  
- Base: (0,3)
- P2 plays A1 → pays 2 → so P2 gets 3 - 2 = 1
- P1 gets 0 (no penalty for A0)
→ **(0,1)**

#### Case 3: P1 A1, P2 A0  
- Base: (3,0)
- P1 plays A1 → pays 2 → P1 gets 3 - 2 = 1
- P2 gets 0
→ **(1,0)**

#### Case 4: P1 A1, P2 A1  
- Base: (1,1)
- Both play A1 → each pays 2
- So P1: 1 - 2 = -1
- P2: 1 - 2 = -1
→ **(-1,-1)**

So C2 payoff matrix:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (2,2)  | (0,1)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (1,0)  | (-1,-1)|

Now analyze.

What is best for P1?

- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 dominates A1 for P1**.

Similarly for P2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is dominant for both players**.

Therefore, the **unique Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**.

And **(A0, A0) gives (2,2)**.

So **under C2**, both players are strongly incentivized to play A0, and **(A0, A0)** is the only stable outcome.

Expected payoff: **2 for P1**.

---

### Step 3: Compare Outcomes

Let’s summarize expected payoffs under each contract:

| Contract | Outcome (likely) | P1’s expected payoff |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| C1 (Player 1's) | (A0,A0) → (3,3) | ~3 |
| C2 (Player 2's) | (A0,A0) → (2,2) | 2 |

So **C1 gives higher payoff for P1**.

But we must consider **approval voting** and **selection mechanism**.

The winning contract is **selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So:
- If **I approve only C1**, then C1 has 1 approval, C2 has 0 → max approvals = 1 → **C1 wins with certainty** → I get ~3.
- If I approve only C2, then C2 has 1 approval → C2 wins → I get 2.
- If I approve both, then both have 1 approval → max = 1 → one chosen at random → 50% chance of C1 (3), 50% chance of C2 (2) → **expected payoff: 0.5×3 + 0.5×2 = 2.5**
- If I approve neither, then both have 0 → max approvals = 0 → but **which one is chosen?** The problem says: "selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals".

If no contract has approval, then the maximum number is 0, and all contracts with 0 approvals (i.e., both) are eligible → so one is chosen uniformly at random.

But the **base game applies if no contract is approved**?

Wait — the problem says: "a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process."

So **if no contract is approved**, then **no contract** is in place → **base game** applies.

So **without any contract**, the game defaults to the original payoffs.

Under the **base game**, what is the likely outcome?

As we saw, there is a pure NE at (A1,A1) → (1,1), and a mixed NE at p=q=3/4.

But (A1,A1) gives both 1 point.

The mixed NE: expected payoff for P1:

- Play A0 with 3/4: then payoff depends on P2’s play
- But since symmetric, expected payoff under mixed strategy NE is:

For P1:  
- P(A0) = 3/4, P(A1) = 1/4  
- If P2 plays A0 (3/4), P1 gets:
  - A0: 2
  - A1: 3
- If P2 plays A1 (1/4), P1 gets:
  - A0: 0
  - A1: 1

So P1’s expected payoff:
= (3/4) [ (3/4)×2 + (1/4)×3 ] + (1/4) [ (3/4)×0 + (1/4)×1 ]  
= (3/4) [ 1.5 + 0.75 ] + (1/4)[0 + 0.25]  
= (3/4)(2.25) + (1/4)(0.25)  
= 1.6875 + 0.0625 = **1.75**

So expected payoff under mixed NE: **1.75**

But (A1,A1) gives 1 — so rational players might play mixed to get 1.75.

But (A0,A0) gives 2 — better — but not stable.

However, in reality, if both players are rational, they might **try to coordinate on A0**, but without communication, it’s risky.

But in **C1 and C2**, we **force cooperation** to A0.

So **in base game**, expected payoff is **about 1.75** (mixed NE) or possibly **1** (pure NE at A1) if players stick to it.

But since (A0,A0) is better but unstable, players might not coordinate.

So best estimate: **expected payoff under base game ≈ 1.75**

Now, let’s compute my expected payoff under all approval scenarios:

#### Option 1: Approve only C1
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 0
- Max approvals = 1
- Only C1 qualifies → **C1 is selected**
- P1 gets **~3**
- **Expected payoff = 3**

#### Option 2: Approve only C2
- C1: 0
- C2: 1
- Max = 1 → C2 selected
- P1 gets 2
- **Expected payoff = 2**

#### Option 3: Approve both
- C1: 1, C2: 1 → max = 1
- Winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance C1, 50% C2
- Expected payoff = 0.5×3 + 0.5×2 = **2.5**

#### Option 4: Approve neither
- Both have 0 approvals
- Max approvals = 0 → both are eligible → one chosen at random → 50% each
- But if no contract is selected → **base game applies**
- Expected payoff ≈ 1.75
- So **expected payoff = 1.75**

---

### **Compare Expected Payoffs:**

- Approve only C1: **3**
- Approve only C2: **2**
- Approve both: **2.5**
- Approve neither: **1.75**

Therefore, **best choice is to approve only C1**, giving us **3 points**.

But wait: could approving C1 **cause C1 to win**, and that’s ideal.

But what if **Player 2 also approves C1**? Then C1 gets 2 approvals, C2 gets 0 → C1 wins with certainty.

But we **don’t know** what Player 2 will do — we only control our own approval.

But in the **approval decision**, we are acting **based on our belief** what others might do.

But since we are **only told about the proposals**, and no information about Player 2’s preferences, we must assume **Player 2 might approve or not**.

But in this analysis, **our expected payoff depends only on our choice** (since we control our approval), **not on Player 2’s**, because the game is defined **before** we decide.

Actually, **yes**, we are to decide on our approval **unilaterally**.

But: the **final outcome depends on whether both approve or not**.

But since **we don’t know Player 2’s choice**, we should **maximize our worst-case expected payoff**, or assume **they act rationally**?

But the problem says: "your objective is to maximize your total points"

And we are to decide **based on the information given**.

We are not told Player 2's strategy.

But note: **C1 is proposed by Player 1 (you)** — so you might **anticipate that Player 2 might not approve it**, or might.

But since **you are Player 1**, and you are proposing C1, **you may assume Player 2 is rational and may not want to approve it**, because it gives **no direct benefit** to P2.

Under C1:
- P2 gets 3 when (A0,A0), 3 when (A0,A1), 1 when (A1,A0), 1 when (A1,A1)
- So P2 **does benefit** — in fact, is better off when P1 plays A0.

But more importantly: under C1, **if Player 2 plays A0**, they get +1, and if Player 1 plays A0, Player 1 gets +1 → so both gain.

But **Player 2’s incentive**?

Under C1, does Player 2 prefer C1?

Let’s check: if C1 is in place, what is Player 2's expected payoff?

As we saw, **P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1** → same payoff in all cases.

But (A0, A0) gives 3 to P2, (A0, A1) gives 3, (A1, A0) gives 1, (A1, A1) gives 1.

So P2 gets 3 if they play A0, regardless of P1.

Gets 1 if they play A1.

So **P2 should want to play A0**.

But P2 gets the same payoff if they play A0 vs A1 only if P1 plays A0 — wait no:

Earlier we saw: P2’s payoff depends:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → equal
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → equal

So **P2 is indifferent**, but if they expect P1 to play A0, they get 3 either way.

But still, **P2 might approve C1**, because it doesn’t hurt them, and gives them 3 when they play A0 (which they might do anyway).

But **Player 2 is not the proposer** — they might not care.

But **since C1 gives P2 nothing extra**, and they might expect P1 to play A0, they might **not** find it worth approving.

But we don’t know.

But in our **decision**, we are to **maximize our expected payoff**.

And **in all cases**, approving C1 **makes it more likely to win**, especially if we are the only one who approves it → it wins.

If we **do not approve C1**, then C1 has 0 approvals → cannot win.

If we **approve C1**, then it has at least 1 approval → can win.

If we **approve C1**, and Player 2 also approves, then C1 has 2 → wins with certainty.

So **approving C1 increases the chance that C1 wins**.

Similarly, **approving C2** increases chance C2 wins.

But C1 gives **higher payoff** than C2 or base case.

So to **maximize expected payoff**, we should **approve C1**.

But what if we approve both?

Then C1 and C2 both have 1 approval → both eligible → one chosen at random → 50% chance C1 (3), 50% chance C2 (2) → expected 2.5

But if we **approve only C1**, then C1 wins with probability 1 (since it has 1, C2 has 0) → payoff 3

**3 > 2.5**, so better to approve only C1.

Similarly, if we approve only C2 → payoff 2

Approve neither → 1.75

So **best is to approve only C1**.

But what if **Player 2 also approves C1**?

Then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 0 → C1 wins → P1 gets 3 → still good.

If **Player 2 approves C2**, then C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → both eligible → random choice → 50% C1 (3), 50% C2 (2) → expected 2.5

But **our approval of C1 increases the chance** that C1 wins, **even if Player 2 approves C2**.

But we **cannot control** Player 2.

But we are to **choose our approval** to **maximize our expected payoff** — and we should do so **regardless of what Player 2 does**.

But **since the outcome depends on both**, we need to consider the worst case.

But **approving C1 guarantees that C1 is eligible to win**, and **C1 is better** than C2 or base.

So even **if Player 2 approves C2**, if we approve C1, then both are eligible → 50% chance of C1 (3), 50% of C2 (2) → 2.5

But if we **do not approve C1**, then C1 has 0 → cannot win → **C2 wins** if it is approved.

But if we **don’t approve C1**, and Player 2 approves C2, then C2 has 1 → wins → P1 gets 2

If we **don’t approve C1**, and Player 2 doesn’t approve C2, then no contract → base game → ~1.75

But **if we approve C1**, and Player 2 approves C2 → C1 and C2 both have 1 → random → 2.5

If we approve C1 and Player 2 doesn’t approve C2 → C1 has 1, C2 has 0 → C1 wins → 3

So in **all cases**, **approving C1 gives higher or equal** expected payoff.

- If Player 2 approves C2: we get 2.5 > 2 (if we don’t approve C1)
- If Player 2 doesn’t approve C2: we get 3 > 1.75 (if we don’t approve C1)

So **approving C1 is always better**.

Now: **should we approve C2?**

If we approve C2, then:

- If Player 2 approves C2 → C2 has 2 → wins → we get 2
- If Player 2 doesn’t approve C2 → then C2 has 1, C1 has 1 → random → 2.5

But **if we approve C2 and also C1**, we get expected 2.5

But if we **only approve C1**, we get **3** (if C2 doesn’t approve) or **2.5** (if C2 approves)

But if we approve **both**, we **never get 3** — max is 2.5

So **approving C2 reduces our best-case payoff** from 3 to 2.5, and gives no benefit.

So **do not approve C2**.

Therefore, **optimal strategy: approve C1, do not approve C2**

This **maximizes** our expected payoff in **all scenarios**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

This is a two-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff first, Player 2's second):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

This is a **coordination game with a tension between cooperation and self-interest**, similar to a *Hawk-Dove* or *Battle of the Sexes* setup, but with asymmetric incentives.

Let’s analyze strategic behavior:

- If you play A0:
  - If opponent plays A0 → you get 2
  - If opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1:
  - If opponent plays A0 → you get 3
  - If opponent plays A1 → you get 1

So, A1 is better *if* the opponent plays A0, but A0 is better *if* the opponent plays A1.

Best responses:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → Player 1 prefers A1 (3 > 2)
- If Player 2 plays A1 → Player 1 prefers A0 (0 < 1 → wait: 1 > 0 → actually A1 gives 1, A0 gives 0 → so A1 is still better)

Wait! Let's correct:

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1: A0 → 0, A1 → 1 → so A1 is better.

So:
- No matter what the other player does, **A1 gives a strictly higher payoff** to Player 1?

Wait — no:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - A1 → 3; A0 → 2 → A1 better
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - A1 → 1; A0 → 0 → A1 better

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 1**.

Same for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - A2: A0 → 2; A1 → 3 → so A1 better
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - A2: A0 → 0; A1 → 1 → A1 better

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2 as well**.

Therefore, **(A1, A1)** is the **unique Nash equilibrium**.

In the base game, both players will play A1, and each gets 1 point.

But is this optimal? Let's check total payoff:

- (A0, A0): (2,2) → total = 4 → Pareto optimal
- (A1, A1): (1,1) → total = 2 → worse for both

So the players are stuck in a **bad equilibrium** due to dominance.

But the **contract mechanism** is supposed to help resolve this inefficiency.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

Each contract modifies the payoffs via **side payments** depending on actions.

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

This means:
- If you play A0 → you get +1
- If you play A1 → nothing

But the money comes from the other player(s) → so if you play A0, you gain +1 **and** the other player loses 1.

So total **transfers = 0** — it's a redistribution.

Let’s write the **net effect** on payoffs:

Suppose you play A0 → +1 (from the other player)
→ so final payoff = base payoff + 1
If you play A1 → no change

But since this applies to **both players**, we need to consider symmetric application.

So for **each player**, if they play A0, they get +1; if A1, nothing.

Thus the **new payoff matrix (after contract C1)** becomes:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (2+1, 2+1) → (3,3) | (0+1, 3+0) → (1,3) |
| **P1: A1**    | (3+0, 0+1) → (3,1) | (1+0, 1+0) → (1,1) |

Wait — correction:
- The payment is **paid by the other player only when you play A0**.
- So only the **player who plays A0 gets +1**; the opponent loses 1.

So in (A0, A0): both players play A0 → both get +1 → (2+1, 2+1) = (3,3)
In (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +1; P2 plays A1 → gets nothing → but P2 must pay 1 to P1 → so P2 loses 1 from base payoff
→ P1: 0 + 1 = 1; P2: 3 - 1 = 2
Similarly, (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → no gain; P2 plays A0 → gets +1, but P1 must pay 1 → so P1’s base 3 → 3 - 1 = 2; P2: 0 + 1 = 1
(A1, A1): neither gets anything → (1,1)

So final matrix (C1):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (3, 3) | (1, 2) |
| **P1: A1**    | (2, 1) | (1, 1) |

Now let’s analyze best responses.

For **Player 1**:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

So P1 will **play A0 if P2 plays A0**, and might play A0 or A1 if P2 plays A1.

For **Player 2**:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

So same: P2 prefers A0 if P1 plays A0.

→ So both players have **incentive to coordinate on (A0,A0)**.

Indeed, (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium (both get 3).

Also, (A0, A1) and (A1, A0) are not equilibria — players would deviate.

And (A1,A1) is still an equilibrium? Let’s check:
- At (A1,A1): both get 1
- If P1 unilaterally deviates to A0: gets 1 (same), but if P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 1 → no incentive to deviate
- But P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 when P2 plays A1 → so deviation doesn’t hurt

But since they are indifferent, (A1,A1) is still a Nash eq, but not strict.

But crucially, (A0,A0) is now better for both, and the **only equilibrium with higher payoff**.

So C1 makes **(A0,A0)** an attractive equilibrium — the efficient one.

Now, here's the key: **Player 1 proposed C1** and is deciding whether to **approve** it.

But **approval is independent**: you’re deciding whether to approve the contract, regardless of who proposed it.

But remember: you are **Player 1**, and the **contract is a vote** — if enough players approve, the contract is selected.

The **winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, so your goal is to **approve contracts that you expect will lead to good outcomes (especially high payoff for you)**.

But **you don't know** what the other player will do — but you can reason about the game **under each contract** and whether it leads to good equilibria.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If you play A0 → +1, and the other player loses 1
- If you play A1 → you lose 1, and the other player gets +1

This is **symmetric in structure** to C1, but now **A1 is penalized**.

So let’s compute the new payoff matrix under C2.

Base payoffs → then apply transfer.

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (2+1, 2+0) because P2 played A0 → P2 gets +1 → but wait: need to be careful

Let’s clarify:

- For **each player**, if they play A0 → they get +1, paid by the other player.
- If they play A1 → they pay -1, paid to the other player.

So:
- In (A0, A0): both play A0 → each gets +1 → (2+1, 2+1) = (3,3)
- In (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +1; P2 plays A1 → pays -1 → so P1 gets base 0 +1 = 1; P2 gets base 3 -1 = 2
- In (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → pays -1 → so gets base 3 -1 = 2; P2 plays A0 → gets +1 → gets 0 +1 = 1
- In (A1, A1): both play A1 → both pay -1 → so P1: 1 -1 = 0; P2: 1 -1 = 0

So matrix for C2:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (3, 3) | (1, 2) |
| **P1: A1**    | (2, 1) | (0, 0) |

Compare to C1:
- C1: (A1,A1) = (1,1)
- C2: (A1,A1) = (0,0) → much worse

Now analyze best responses.

For **Player 1**:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 strictly dominates A1 for Player 1** in C2.

For **Player 2**:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 dominates A1 for Player 2 as well**

→ So **(A0,A0)** is the unique Nash equilibrium.

And both get 3 → better than base game.

So **C2 also leads to (A0,A0)** with 3 points each.

So both C1 and C2 seem good?

But now, the critical thing: **you are Player 1**, so your **payoff matters**.

Let’s compare:

- **Under C1**: (A0,A0) → you get 3
- **Under C2**: (A0,A0) → you get 3

Same.

But are there any **lower equilibria**?

In C1:
- (A1,A1): (1,1) — still a Nash equilibrium (since P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 when P2 plays A1; same for P2)
  - But if both play A1, and P1 deviates to A0 → gets 1 (same as before), so no incentive to deviate → so (A1,A1) remains NE
- In C2:
  - (A1,A1): (0,0)
    - If P1 deviates to A0 → gets 1 (when P2 plays A1) → better → so P1 wants to deviate
    - So (A1,A1) is **not** a Nash equilibrium under C2
    - So only (A0,A0) is NE → **more robust**

So C2 **eliminates (A1,A1) as an equilibrium** → much better coordination to (A0,A0)

C1 allows (A1,A1) to survive as a possible equilibrium — which is risky, since both players might end up there by accident.

So C2 is **more effective** at steering players toward (A0,A0), because (A1,A1) is not stable.

But from **your point of view (Player 1)** — you care about **expected payoff**, which depends on **what equilibrium emerges**.

Now consider the **approval process**:

- Contracts are voted on by both players.
- The **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.
- So your approval strategy may depend on:
  - What you think the other player will do.
  - Which contract gives you higher expected payoff.

Now, **you are Player 1** — so you are deciding whether to approve C1 and C2.

C1 was proposed by **You**, C2 by the other player.

Let’s think about the **other player’s incentives**.

#### **What will the other player (Player 2) do in terms of approval?**

For **Player 2**, which contract is better?

- **C1**: under C1, if both play A0 → P2 gets 3
- **C2**: under C2, if both play A0 → P2 gets 3

So both give same **best payoff**?

But let's compare **incentives**.

- C1: A1 is not penalized → so if Player 2 thinks P1 might play A1, P2 might still play A1 → (A1,A1) is a NE → both get 1 → not bad
- C2: A1 is penalized → (A1,A1) is not NE → so P2 is strongly incentivized to play A0

So **C2 is better for Player 2 in terms of coordination**.

But is there a downside?

- Under C1: (A1,A1) gives P2 1
- Under C2: (A1,A1) gives P2 0 — worse

So for Player 2, both C1 and C2 allow them to get 3 if they coordinate on A0.

But **C1 is safer for P2**, because even if coordination fails, they’re not punished as badly.

But **C2 is better for coordination success**.

So Player 2 would prefer **C2 over C1**, probably, because it increases the chance of getting 3.

But in the **approval vote**, Player 2 will approve contracts they want.

Now, suppose you **approve C1** and **disapprove C2**, and Player 2 approves **both** — then both contracts get 1 approval → max approvals = 1 → random selection → each has 50% chance.

Then your **expected payoff**:
- With 50% chance of C1 → you get 3 (in equilibrium)
- With 50% chance of C2 → you get 3

So expected payoff = 3

But wait — in C1, (A1,A1) is still a Nash equilibrium → so if players don’t coordinate well, you might end up at (A1,A1) → getting 1.

In C2, (A1,A1) is not a NE → so only (A0,A0) is stable.

So if both players are rational and expect the other to be rational, in **C2**, they will **necessarily** converge to (A0,A0) → no risk.

In **C1**, there is **risk** of (A1,A1) — which gives you only 1.

So **C2 leads to a more reliable outcome**.

Therefore, as a rational player, you should *prefer* C2 over C1, because it eliminates the bad equilibrium.

Even though both can lead to (A0,A0), **C2 makes it inevitable**, while C1 allows for failure.

Now, what about approval?

But here's a twist: **you are Player 1**, and **you proposed C1**.

You want to **maximize your expected points**.

So let’s assume that **both players are rational** and will play best responses.

So if **C2 is selected**, then **(A0,A0)** is the only equilibrium → you get 3.

If **C1 is selected**, then **(A0,A0)** is an equilibrium, and so is **(A1,A1)**.

So if C1 is selected, what happens?

- Could players coordinate on (A0,A0)?
- But if they are unsure, they might fall into (A1,A1)

So **C1 has uncertainty** — your payoff depends on coordination.

But **C2 has certainty** — (A0,A0) is the unique equilibrium.

So **C2 is safer**.

Now, suppose that **Player 2** will approve **C2**, and likely **also approve C1** — because C1 also gives them 3, and (A1,A1) gives them 1, which is better than 0.

So Player 2 might approve **both**.

C1 was proposed by you — you might want to support it.

But you should only approve if it's **in your interest**.

Let’s evaluate **your own payoff under each contract, assuming rational play**.

### **Expected Payoff under Each Contract**

- **If C1 is chosen**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are both NE. But (A0,A0) gives you 3; (A1,A1) gives you 1.

  - If both players are rational and expect the other to be rational, they *might* coordinate on (A0,A0), but **A0 is not dominant** under C1.

    - For P1: if P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0 (3 vs 2)
    - If P2 plays A1 → P1 is indifferent (1 vs 1)
    → So P1 has no incentive to play A0 unless P2 does.

    But this is a **coordination game**, so multiple equilibria.

    → **Uncertainty**: you might get 3 or 1.

    If you assume players randomize or fail to coordinate, expected payoff < 3.

    But if they *do* coordinate on (A0,A0), you get 3.

    But **C2 eliminates this risk**.

- **If C2 is chosen**: (A0,A0) is the **only Nash equilibrium** → both players will play A0 → you get 3 with certainty.

So **C2 gives you guaranteed 3**.

C1 gives you expected payoff **at most 3**, but possibly less.

Therefore, **you prefer C2 over C1**.

Now, what about **approval**?

- You want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

- You don't know which contract will win, but **you control your votes**.

- The winning contract is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum approvals**.

So **your approval decision affects which contracts are likely to win**.

Let’s suppose:

- Player 2 is rational → they will approve **C2** (since it’s better for their coordination) and likely **C1** as well.

So if you **approve both**, then both get 2 approvals.

Then **both are tied for max approvals** → so uniform random choice → 50% each.

Then your **expected payoff**:
- 0.5 × (3 under C1) + 0.5 × (3 under C2) = 3

Wait — but under C1, **you might not get 3** — you might get 1 if they play (A1,A1).

But if **both players are rational**, they should coordinate on (A0,A0) under C1.

But is there an **equilibrium selection problem**?

In game theory, without **focal points** or **precautions**, multiple equilibria are problematic.

But here, **(A0,A0)** is **Pareto dominant** — so it's the likely candidate.

But **(A1,A1)** gives 1, and is a NE — so players might fall into it.

To be conservative, assume that under C1, there is a **50% chance** of coordination failure → you get 1, 50% chance you get 3 → expected = (3+1)/2 = 2.

But under C2, you are guaranteed 3.

So **under C1, your expected payoff is 2**, under C2, it's 3.

But if you **only approve C1**, and Player 2 approves both, then:
- C1: 2 approvals (you + P2)
- C2: 1 approval (just P2)
→ So C1 wins with 100% probability → you get expected payoff = 2

If you approve **C2**, and Player 2 approves both:
- C1: 1 (only P2)
- C2: 2 (you + P2)
→ C2 wins → you get 3

If you approve **neither**, then C1: 1 (P2), C2: 1 (P2) → both have 1 approval → random pick → 50% chance C1 (you get 2 expected), 50% C2 (you get 3) → expected = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

But if you **approve C2**, you ensure that **C2 wins** (assuming P2 approves it), so you get 3.

But **do you trust P2 to approve C2**?

Yes — because C2 is better for P2 too: under C2, P2 gets 3 if coordinated, 0 if not — but under C1, P2 gets 3 or 1.

So C2 is better for coordination — P2 should approve it.

Now, **C2 is better for you** than C1 → so you should **approve C2**.

What about C1?

**Should you approve C1?**

- If you approve C1, and C2 also gets 2 approvals → both win with same chance → you get expected payoff = 0.5×(payoff under C1) + 0.5×(3)

- But if C1 is selected, and (A0,A0) is not guaranteed, you might get only **2 expected** (e.g., 50% 3, 50% 1)

→ So expected payoff under C1 ≈ 2

→ So total expected payoff = 0.5×2 + 0.5×3 = 1 + 1.5 = 2.5

But if you **only approve C2**, and P2 approves C2 → C2 wins → you get 3 → **better than 2.5**

So **you should not approve C1**.

Even though you proposed C1, **C2 is better for you**.

Approving both reduces your expected payoff from 3 to 2.5, because it might lead to C1 — which is worse.

Therefore, **you should only approve C2**.

Now, is there any reason to approve C1?

Only if you think **C2 is risky** — but it's not.

C2 is **better** for coordination, **eliminates the bad equilibrium**, and gives you **higher payoff certainty**.

So yes, **approve C2, disapprove C1**.

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

- Approve C1: **No** → because it’s riskier and gives lower expected payoff
- Approve C2: **Yes** → because it guarantees (A0,A0), gives you 3 points, and eliminates the bad equilibrium

Even though C1 was proposed by you, **C2 is superior**.

So you should **not approve C1**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without the Contract)**

This is a two-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

This is a variant of the **"Battle of the Sexes"** or **"Chicken"** game type, but not exactly standard.

Let’s analyze the incentives.

- If you choose A0:
  - If opponent plays A0 → you get 2
  - If opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- If you choose A1:
  - If opponent plays A0 → you get 3
  - If opponent plays A1 → you get 1

So:
- A1 dominates A0 **if** you think the other player is likely to play A0 (since 3 > 2 and 1 > 0).
- But if you think the other player will play A1, then A0 gives you 0, A1 gives you 1 → so A1 still better.
- A0 is only good if the other player plays A0.

But now: **the contract changes things.**

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

This means:
- **Every time you choose A0**, you get **+2 points** (from the other player).
- **Every time you choose A1**, no extra payment.

But "drawn equally from the other players" — since there are two players, and the total 2 points comes from the other player, that would mean:
- The other player loses 2 points if *you* choose A0.

This is **critical**.

So, **your actual total payoff** when choosing an action includes:
- The base payoff from the game matrix
- **+2** if you played A0
- **-2** from the other player if you played A0 (but this is equivalent to you gaining +2 while they lose 2, netting you +2)

**Therefore, when you choose A0**, your total payoff becomes:
> **Base payoff + 2**

When you choose A1:
> **Base payoff + 0**

So the **contract effectively adds +2 to your payoff if you play A0**, and subtracts 2 from the other player’s payoff.

Thus, we can now **adjust the payoff matrix for Player 1** (yourself) **based on your action**, and the other player's action.

Let’s recast the full payoff matrix **including the contract effect**.

---

### **Step 3: Adjust Payoffs with Contract**

We now compute your **true payoff** as Player 1.

Let’s go through each cell.

#### 1. You: A0, Other: A0
- Base: (2, 2)
- You played A0 → gain +2 → your total: 2 + 2 = **4**
- Other played A0 → they gain +2 → their payoff: 2 + 2 = 4
- ✅ Your payoff: **4**

#### 2. You: A0, Other: A1
- Base: (0, 3)
- You played A0 → gain +2 → your total: 0 + 2 = **2**
- Other played A1 → no payment → their payoff: 3 (unchanged)
- ✅ Your payoff: **2**

#### 3. You: A1, Other: A0
- Base: (3, 0)
- You played A1 → no bonus → your payoff: 3
- Other played A0 → they get +2 → their payoff: 0 + 2 = 2
- ✅ Your payoff: **3**

#### 4. You: A1, Other: A1
- Base: (1, 1)
- You played A1 → no bonus → your payoff: 1
- Other played A1 → no bonus → their payoff: 1
- ✅ Your payoff: **1**

So the **adjusted payoff matrix for Player 1** (you) is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | 4      | 2      |
| **You: A1**   | 3      | 1      |

Now, the other player's payoffs are changed too, but since you are only optimizing **your own** points, we focus on your payoffs.

But — **your strategy choice depends on what you think the other player will do**, and **the other player’s incentives are also changed by the contract**.

Wait — we must now consider: **How does the contract affect the other player’s incentives?**

Because **they are rational too**, and will choose their own strategy to maximize their own payoff.

So we need to analyze **the full strategic environment**, including both players' incentives.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the Other Player’s Incentives (Player 2)**

Similarly, the contract gives a **+2 bonus to any player who chooses A0**.

So for **Player 2 (the other player)**, the payoff matrix (in terms of their own points) is:

|               | You: A0 | You: A1 |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **P2: A0**    | (2+2, 2+2) = (4,4) → P2 gets **4** | (0+2, 3) → wait, no:
- When P2 plays A0, they get +2, regardless of what you do.

Let’s recompute **Player 2’s payoff matrix** based on their action.

#### 1. P1: A0, P2: A0
- Base: (2, 2)
- P2 chooses A0 → gets +2 → total = 4

#### 2. P1: A0, P2: A1
- Base: (0, 3)
- P2 chooses A1 → no bonus → payoff = 3

#### 3. P1: A1, P2: A0
- Base: (3, 0)
- P2 chooses A0 → gets +2 → total = 0 + 2 = 2

#### 4. P1: A1, P2: A1
- Base: (1, 1)
- P2 chooses A1 → no bonus → payoff = 1

So **Player 2’s payoff matrix** is:

|               | You: A0 | You: A1 |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **P2: A0**    | 4       | 2       |
| **P2: A1**    | 3       | 1       |

Wait — this is **identical in structure** to your matrix!

Indeed, because the contract treats both players symmetrically: **any A0 choice gives +2 to that player**.

So both players have the **same adjusted payoff matrix**.

This is now a **symmetric game**.

So both players have the same incentives.

Your payoff when:
- You play A0: 4 vs A0, 2 vs A1
- You play A1: 3 vs A0, 1 vs A1

And same for the other player.

So both players face:

|            | Opp: A0 | Opp: A1 |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **You: A0** | 4       | 2       |
| **You: A1** | 3       | 1       |

So for you, **A0 is strictly better than A1** in both cases:
- vs A0: 4 > 3
- vs A1: 2 > 1

Therefore, **A0 dominates A1** for you.

But we must be careful: **this assumes that the other player chooses their action independently**, but they are rational too — and they see the same incentives.

So **both players have a strict incentive to play A0**, because it dominates.

Therefore, **in Nash equilibrium**, both players will choose **A0**.

Why? Because regardless of what the other person does, A0 gives you higher payoff than A1.

Let’s verify:

For **you**, given that other player plays A0: you get 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → A0 better  
Given other plays A1: you get 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → A0 better  

So **A0 is strictly dominant strategy for you**.

Same for the other player.

Therefore, **(A0, A0)** is the **unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium**.

And since the game is symmetric and both players can reason this way, it's the stable outcome.

Thus, if both players are rational, they will both play A0.

But — the game allows **mixed strategies**, but since A0 dominates A1, **no rational player would ever play A1** — even probabilistically.

So **best response** is **A0 with probability 100%**.

But wait — let's test for **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p).

Then your expected payoff from:
- Playing A0: 4*p + 2*(1-p) = 4p + 2 - 2p = 2p + 2
- Playing A1: 3*p + 1*(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1

Now compare:
- A0 gives: 2p + 2
- A1 gives: 2p + 1

So **A0 always gives 1 more than A1**, regardless of p.

Therefore, **you should always choose A0**.

No matter what the other player does, A0 gives you strictly more.

So **your best strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability**.

Same for the other player.

Hence, the **unique Nash equilibrium** is both playing A0.

Moreover, since the game is symmetric and A0 dominates A1 for both, **no player can profitably deviate**.

---

### **Step 5: Final Decision**

You are Player 1. You want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Given that:
- A0 dominates A1
- Both players are rational and will respond optimally
- Even if you play mixed, A0 gives higher payoff in all cases

So your **optimal strategy** is to play **A0 with 100% probability**.

Thus:

- A0: 100
- A1: 0

Sum = 100 → valid.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
The goal is to decide whether to sign the contract, with the objective of maximizing my total points. Let's analyze the payoff structure both with and without the contract.

### Without the Contract
The original payoffs given are as follows:
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 point, the other player gets 1 point.

### With the Contract
Let's add the contract modifiers to the payoffs:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Therefore, the new payoffs considering the contract additions are:
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:
  - Your payoff: 2 + 1 = 3 points
  - Other player's payoff: 2 + 1 = 3 points
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - Your payoff: 0 + 1 = 1 point
  - Other player's payoff: 3 - 1 = 2 points
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - Your payoff: 3 - 1 = 2 points
  - Other player's payoff: 0 + 1 = 1 point
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:
  - Your payoff: 1 - 1 = 0 points
  - Other player's payoff: 1 - 1 = 0 points

### Analysis
- Without the contract:
  - A0-A0: 2 points each
  - A0-A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points
  - A1-A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points
  - A1-A1: 1 point each

- With the contract:
  - A0-A0: 3 points each
  - A0-A1: You get 1 point, the other player gets 2 points
  - A1-A0: You get 2 points, the other player gets 1 point
  - A1-A1: 0 points each

### Decision
To determine whether or not to sign the contract, we should compare the payoffs from different probable strategies:

- In a scenario where mutual cooperation (A0-A0) is expected, the contract improves both players' scores to 3.
- If there is a mix of choices (one player choosing A0, the other choosing A1), the contract reduces the negative impact for the player who chooses A0 and reduces the reward for the player who chooses A1.
- In competitive scenarios (A1-A0), the net benefit would be slightly reduced with the contract.
- Both choosing A1 results in 0 points with the contract, compared to 1 point without it.

Given that the contract overall reduces the risk associated with choosing A0 but also dampens the high reward of A1 and only benefits mutual cooperation, signing the contract could be beneficial for promoting cooperation.

Therefore, considering the balanced nature of the strategies and the potential gains and losses, I would choose to sign the contract.

Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

This is a simultaneous-move game with two players, each choosing between **A0** and **A1**. The payoffs are:

| You \ Other | A0       | A1       |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**      | 2, 2     | 0, 3     |
| **A1**      | 3, 0     | 1, 1     |

You are **Player 2** (i.e., the row player, the one who chooses A0 or A1, and you get the first payoff in each cell).

Let’s find the Nash equilibria in the base game (without contracts).

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria:
- (A0, A0): You get 2. If you deviate to A1, you get 3 → better → not NE.
- (A0, A1): You get 0. If you deviate to A1, you get 1 → better → not NE.
- (A1, A0): You get 3. If you deviate to A0, you get 2 → worse. Other player: currently gets 0; if they deviate to A1, they get 1 → better → not NE.
- (A1, A1): You get 1. If you deviate to A0, you get 0 → worse. Other gets 1; if they deviate to A0, they get 0 → worse. So **(A1, A1)** is a pure NE.

But note: (A0, A0) is not a NE because you can profitably deviate to A1.

#### Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium:
Let’s find the mixed strategy where both players are indifferent.

Let **p** = your probability of choosing A0.  
Let **q** = other player's probability of choosing A0.

Your expected payoff from A0:  
= q × 2 + (1 - q) × 0 = 2q

Your expected payoff from A1:  
= q × 3 + (1 - q) × 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1

Set equal for indifference:  
2q = 2q + 1 → 0 = 1 → impossible.

Wait — that suggests you **never** play A0 in a mixed equilibrium? That can’t be.

Wait, confusion: in mixed equilibrium, **you** select p to make the other player indifferent.

So let’s properly compute the mixed strategy where the **other player** is indifferent.

Let **p** = your probability of choosing A0.  
So probability you choose A1 is (1 - p).

Other player’s payoff from A0:
= p × 2 + (1 - p) × 0 = 2p

Other player’s payoff from A1:
= p × 3 + (1 - p) × 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1

Set equal:  
2p = 2p + 1 → 0 = 1 → again impossible.

So there is **no** mixed strategy where the other player is indifferent.

Wait — that can’t be right. Let's reframe.

Actually, both players have the same payoff matrix (symmetric), but **you** are Player 2, and you’re analyzing from your perspective.

Wait, the matrix is **not symmetric**:
- When you choose A0, other chooses A0: (2,2)
- You A0, other A1: (0,3)
- You A1, other A0: (3,0)
- You A1, other A1: (1,1)

So it is symmetric in payoffs, but player roles matter.

Let me write it again clearly:

| Your choice \ Other’s choice | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| A0                            | 2, 2     | 0, 3     |
| A1                            | 3, 0     | 1, 1     |

So it’s a **coordination game with a twist**: (A0, A0) gives both 2, but (A1, A1) gives both 1. But if you unilaterally defect to A1 when the other chooses A0, you gain (3 > 2), but the other loses (0 < 2).

This is similar to a **Hawk-Dove game** or **Battle of the Sexes with asymmetric payoffs**.

Let’s find best responses.

**Your best response to other's A0:**
- If other plays A0:
  - You play A0 → 2
  - A1 → 3 → so you prefer A1

**Your best response to other's A1:**
- If other plays A1:
  - You play A0 → 0
  - A1 → 1 → so you prefer A1

So **A1 is dominant strategy for you**!

Wait: for **you**, regardless of what other does, A1 gives higher payoff:
- If other A0: A1 gives 3 > 2 (A0)
- If other A1: A1 gives 1 > 0 (A0)

So yes: **A1 dominates A0 for you**.

Therefore, **your best response is always A1**, regardless of what the other player does.

Similarly, for the other player:
- If you play A0: they get 2 (A0) or 3 (A1) → prefer A1
- If you play A1: they get 0 (A0) or 1 (A1) → prefer A1

So A1 is also dominant for them.

Therefore, **(A1, A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium.

And in that outcome, each gets 1 point.

But (A0, A0) gives both 2, which is better, but it’s not stable — both have incentive to deviate.

So without contracts, the result will be (A1, A1) → you get 1 point.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

Now, we’re introducing contract payments via approval voting.

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of **1 point**, drawn equally from the other player(s).

So since there are 2 players, if you choose A0, you get +1 → but that 1 point comes from the **other player**: i.e., the other player loses 1 point for *your* choice of A0.

So **payoff adjustment**:
- If you play A0: you gain +1 (default payoff +1), other player loses 1
- If you play A1: no change

Note: "drawn equally from the other players" — if there's only one other, then it’s fully from them.

So for **you**, your total payoff becomes:

- If you play A0, other plays A0:
  - Base: 2, but you get +1, other loses 1 → you: 3, other: 1

- You A0, other A1:
  - Base: 0, you get +1 → you: 1, other: 3 - 1 = 2

- You A1, other A0:
  - Base: 3, no change → you: 3, other: 0

- You A1, other A1:
  - Base: 1, no change → you: 1, other: 1

Let’s write the **new payoff matrix** under C1:

| You \ Other | A0        | A1        |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| A0          | 3, 1      | 1, 2      |
| A1          | 3, 0      | 1, 1      |

Now, observe: **A0 is strictly better for you when other plays A0** (3 vs 3? Wait: same), but look:

- If other plays A0: you get 3 (A0) or 3 (A1) → indifferent
- If other plays A1: you get 1 (A0) or 1 (A1) → indifferent

So your payoff is always 3 or 1, regardless — so indifference.

But **your choice doesn’t affect your payoff**? Wait:

- If you play A0 and other plays A0: 3
- You play A0 and other A1: 1
- You play A1 and other A0: 3
- You play A1 and other A1: 1

So your final payoff is:
- 3 if other plays A0
- 1 if other plays A1

So **you have no incentive to change your action** — your payoff depends only on **other's action**.

But the key is: **if other plays A0**, then:
- You get 3 whether you choose A0 or A1 → indifferent

But if other plays A1, you get 1 regardless → so still indifferent.

So no incentive to do anything.

But what does **other player** see?

Let’s look at **other player's payoff** under C1:

- You A0, other A0: other gets 1 (from 2 -1)
- You A0, other A1: other gets 2 (from 3 -1)
- You A1, other A0: other gets 0 (no change)
- You A1, other A1: other gets 1 (no change)

So other player's payoff matrix from their view:

| Other \ You | A0        | A1        |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| A0          | 1         | 0         |
| A1          | 2         | 1         |

So best responses:
- If you (Player 2) play A0: other prefers A1 (2 vs 1)
- If you play A1: other prefers A1 (1 vs 0)

So **A1 is best response for other player no matter what you do**.

Therefore, **other player will play A1**.

Then, **you**, knowing that other plays A1, are indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give you 1).

So your expected payoff = 1.

But in the original game, you also got 1.

So **no gain** — and you might be punished **if** you play A0, because other gets more, but that doesn’t hurt you.

But **can you influence the outcome**?

Suppose you **play A0** when other plays A1: you get 1, same as before.

But **other player is incentivized to play A1** — and in fact, dominated strategy.

So outcome: **(A0, A1) or (A1, A1)** — both give you 1.

So **you are neutral**, and the outcome is same.

But wait — could you **benefit** if both play A0?

But **other player has no incentive to play A0** — they get 1 if you play A0, but 2 if you play A1.

So **they prefer you to play A1**, so **they will never play A0**.

So the only possible outcomes are when other plays A1.

Then your payoff is always 1.

So **under C1**, your expected payoff is **1** — same as base game.

But **you risk being exploited** if other plays A1 and you play A0: you still get 1, but other gains more. But you don't lose.

So **you are not worse off**, but no gain.

But the **contract could only help if it induces better outcomes**.

So **C1 does not help you**.

But you might still approve it if it helps you **in a coordinated way**, but here it doesn’t.

Now, **C2** (Proposed by Player 2):

- If a player chooses A0: **no additional payments**
- If a player chooses A1: they **pay an additional payment of 1 point**, distributed equally among the other players

So: if you (Player 2) choose A1, you lose 1 point, and the **other player gains 1 point** (since there is only one other).

If you choose A0: no cost.

So your payoff changes as follows:

- You A0, other A0: base 2 → no change → you: 2
- You A0, other A1: base 0 → no change → you: 0
- You A1, other A0: base 3 → but you pay 1 → you: 2, other: 0 + 1 = 1
- You A1, other A1: base 1 → you pay 1 → you: 0, other: 1 + 1 = 2

So new payoff matrix:

| You \ Other | A0       | A1       |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| A0          | 2, 2     | 0, 3     |
| A1          | 2, 1     | 0, 2     |

Now, analyze your incentives.

Your payoffs:
- If other plays A0:
  - A0: 2
  - A1: 2 → indifferent
- If other plays A1:
  - A0: 0
  - A1: 0 → indifferent

So again, **your payoff depends only on what the other player does**, not on your action.

Specifically:
- If other plays A0 → you get 2 regardless
- If other plays A1 → you get 0 regardless

So you are indifferent between A0 and A1 in both cases.

But now, let’s look at **other player’s incentives**.

Other player's payoffs:
- You A0, other A0: 2
- You A0, other A1: 3
- You A1, other A0: 1 (old 0 + 1 from your cost)
- You A1, other A1: 2 (old 1 + 1)

So other’s payoff matrix:

| Other \ You | A0      | A1      |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| A0          | 2       | 1       |
| A1          | 3       | 2       |

Now, best responses:
- If you play A0: other prefers A1 (3 > 2)
- If you play A1: other prefers A1 (2 > 1)

So **A1 is dominant for other player**.

Thus, other player will play A1.

Then, **you**, knowing other plays A1, get 0 regardless of your action.

So **your expected payoff = 0**

But wait: that is **worse than base equilibrium (1 point)**.

And you didn’t even have a chance to get 2.

So **C2 is bad for you**.

In fact, under C2, your payoff is **0**, because other plays A1, and you get 0.

Therefore, **you should not approve C2**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare C1 vs C2**

- **C1 (from P1)**: you get **1 point**, same as base game ★
- **C2 (from P2)**: you get **0 points** — **worse**

But wait — could C1 **ever** give you more?

Only if other player is induced to play A0.

But under C1, other player **has no incentive to play A0** — because:
- If you play A0: other gets 1 (if A0) or 2 (if A1) → prefers A1
- If you play A1: other gets 0 (if A0) or 1 (if A1) → prefers A1

So other always best response is A1.

So outcome: other plays A1.

Then your payoff: 1 if you play A0 or A1 — same.

So you get 1.

No better.

But **C2 forces you to pay 1 if you play A1**, and other gets +1.

So if you play A1, you get 0 instead of 1.

So **C2 is bad**.

Now — could **C2** be useful if you could coordinate?

For example, if both play A0:
- You: base 2
- Other: base 2
- Now: you play A0 → no cost → 2
- Other plays A0 → no cost → 2

So both get 2.

But under C2, **other player has no incentive to play A0** — they prefer A1, because it gives them 3 (if you play A0), or 2 (if you play A1), both better than 2 or 1.

So **they never play A0** — even if you play A0.

So **C2 cannot induce A0**.

Therefore, **C2 leads to worse outcome**.

---

### **Step 4: But What If We Could Coordinate?**

The key is: **contracts are voted on by approval voting**, and the **winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So **you want to approve contracts that you benefit from**, and **that others are likely to approve**, so that the contract has a chance.

But you only care about **your own payoff**.

So your goal: **maximize your expected payoff under the final contract**.

Now, think: **what contracts could lead to better outcomes?**

But the only two proposed are C1 and C2.

So only options.

Now, **C1**:
- You get at least 1 point (in fact, exactly 1 in equilibrium, since other plays A1)
- You don’t get more than that
- But you’re not worse off

**C2**:
- You get 0
- So you lose

So **C1 is better for you**.

But **should you approve C1?**

Yes, because:
- You **don’t lose** → you get at least as much as base game
- And you don’t risk worse outcome
- The other player may **benefit** from C1, so they might approve it, but even if not, you’re not hurt.

But **if C1 is approved by enough players**, it can be selected.

Now, **C2**: you get **0**, which is worse than base (1), so **you should not approve it**.

Even if you approve it, **you lose**.

So **approval of C2 is bad for you**.

---

### **Final Decision**

- **C1**: you get 1 point (no worse than base), so **approve**
- **C2**: you get 0 point (worse), so **disapprove**

So:
```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}
```

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}
```

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let’s analyze this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

This is a symmetric game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

Note: Since you are **Player 2**, the payoffs are in the order (Your points, Opponent’s points).

This is a classic coordination/anti-coordination game with a mixed equilibrium.

---

### **Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium of the Base Game**

Let:
- $ p $ = probability you (Player 2) play A0
- $ q $ = probability Player 1 plays A0

Your expected payoff as Player 2:

$$
EU_2 = p \cdot [q \cdot 2 + (1 - q) \cdot 3] + (1 - p) \cdot [q \cdot 0 + (1 - q) \cdot 1]
$$
$$
= p \cdot [2q + 3(1 - q)] + (1 - p) \cdot [0 + (1 - q)]
= p \cdot (2q + 3 - 3q) + (1 - p)(1 - q)
= p \cdot (3 - q) + (1 - p)(1 - q)
$$

To find best response, take derivative w.r.t. $ p $:

$$
\frac{dEU_2}{dp} = (3 - q) - (1 - q) = 2
$$

Wait — this derivative is **positive** regardless of $ q $. That would suggest you should always play $ p = 1 $, i.e., always A0?

But that **can't** be right — that would mean you never want to play A1, but A1 gives you 3 points when the opponent plays A0, which is tempting.

Let’s double-check the expected payoff.

Better: Compute expected payoff **as a function of strategy**.

Let’s fix Player 1’s strategy: $ q = P(\text{Player 1 chooses A0}) $

Then your expected payoff for choosing A0:
- If you choose A0:
  - With probability $ q $: opponent chooses A0 → you get 2
  - With probability $ 1 - q $: opponent chooses A1 → you get 0
  → $ EU_2(A0) = 2q $

- If you choose A1:
  - With probability $ q $: opponent chooses A0 → you get 3
  - With probability $ 1 - q $: opponent chooses A1 → you get 1
  → $ EU_2(A1) = 3q + 1(1 - q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1 $

So you prefer A1 over A0 if:
$$
2q + 1 > 2q \Rightarrow 1 > 0 \quad \text{(always true)}
$$

So **A1 is always better than A0**, regardless of $ q $?

Wait — that can't be — let's go back.

Wait — in the case where **you choose A0**, and **opponent chooses A1**, you get **0**.

When **you choose A1**, and **opponent chooses A1**, you get **1**.

Yes — so:
- A0: $ 2q + 0(1 - q) = 2q $
- A1: $ 3q + 1(1 - q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1 $

So **A1 gives you 1 more than A0**, **no matter what $ q $ is**.

So **your best response is always to play A1**, regardless of what Player 1 does.

Similarly, let’s look at Player 1's incentives.

Player 1’s payoff:
- A0: $ 2q + 3(1 - q) = 2q + 3 - 3q = 3 - q $
- A1: $ 3q + 1(1 - q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1 $

Player 1 chooses A0 if $ 3 - q > 2q + 1 $ → $ 3 - 1 > 3q $ → $ 2 > 3q $ → $ q < 2/3 $

So Player 1 plays A0 only if $ q < 2/3 $

But you’re always playing A1 (since A1 is always better than A0 for you), so $ q = 0 $ from your perspective.

But if you **always** play A1, then Player 1 knows that.

So let's find the Nash Equilibrium.

---

### **Best Response Analysis**

You (Player 2) always prefer A1 over A0 → so your best response is to play A1 with probability 1.

So $ p = 1 $

Now, if you play A1 with probability 1, then Player 1’s expected payoff:

- A0: gets 2 if you play A0 (but you never do) → so with probability 1, you play A1 → Player 1 gets 3 if they play A0, 1 if they play A1
  → So Player 1 gets 3 for A0, 1 for A1 → so they prefer A0.

So Player 1 best response to you playing A1 is to play A0.

But if Player 1 plays A0, then you (Player 2) get:
- A0: 2 (if you play A0)
- A1: 3 (if you play A1)

So you prefer A1.

So we have:
- You play A1
- Player 1 plays A0

Is this a Nash equilibrium?

Yes:
- You: given Player 1 plays A0 → best response is A1 (3 > 2)
- Player 1: given you play A1 → best response is A0 (3 > 1)

So (A1 for you, A0 for Player 1) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

Are there others?

Check if (A0, A1) possible?

You play A0, Player 1 plays A1.

Your payoff: if you play A0 and they play A1 → you get 0

But if you switch to A1, you get 1 → better → so not equilibrium.

(A0, A0): you get 2, but if you switch to A1, you get 3 → so not best response.

(A1, A1): you get 1; if you switch to A0, you get 0 → not better.

But Player 1 gets 1 if both play A1.

If Player 1 switches to A0, gets 0 → no, so Player 1 prefers to stay.

But you prefer to play A1 → so you would stay.

But is (A1, A1) a Nash equilibrium?

You: if you play A1, and they play A1 → you get 1.
If you switch to A0 → you get 0 → so yes, you prefer A1.

Player 1: if they play A1, you play A1 → they get 1.
If they switch to A0 → they get 0 → so they prefer A1.

So (A1, A1) is **also** a pure Nash equilibrium!

So there are **two pure Nash equilibria**:
1. (A1, A0) → you get 3, they get 0
2. (A1, A1) → you get 1, they get 1

And possibly a mixed one.

So you have a conflict: you prefer (A1, A0) to (A1, A1), but both are equilibria.

But without coordination, the outcome is uncertain.

---

### **Step 3: Introduce the Contracts**

Now, contracts can be introduced that **add payments** based on the action chosen.

Contracts are designed to **modify the effective payoffs**.

Recall: You are **Player 2**, and you want to **maximize your total expected points**.

The contracts are:
- **C1 (Player 1’s proposal):** If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional **2 points**, split **equally among the other players**.
- **C2 (Player 2’s proposal):** If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional **1 point**, split **equally among the other players**.

Note: This payment is **in addition** to the base payoff.

Also, since the game has **only two players**, "other players" means the **single opponent**.

So for a player who chooses A1, they **pay a penalty** of X points (which is removed from their own balance), and the **opponent receives X points**.

Let’s clarify:

- If you choose A1 → you pay 2 points (C1) → you lose 2, opponent gains 2.
- If opponent chooses A1 → they pay 2 → they lose 2, you gain 2.

So it’s a **transfer**: a cost to the player who chooses A1, transferred to the other player.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the Effect of Each Contract**

We will compute the **effective payoffs under each contract**, and then determine the **Nash equilibrium of the modified game**, and your **expected payoff**.

Then decide: do you approve of the contract?

You approve a contract if, **under the modified game**, the equilibrium outcome (or expected outcome) **gives you higher expected payoff than under the base game** (especially compared to other contracts), assuming that the contract will be implemented if approved.

But the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum approvals**.

So **you want to maximize your chances of getting a contract that leads to a high payoff for you**.

But since you control your own approvals, and the final contract is the one with the **most approvals**, you should only approve contracts that **you consider beneficial to you**, given that **if enough others approve**, it will be adopted.

But **only you are deciding** whether to approve — the other player’s decision is not under your control.

So to maximize your **expected total points**, you must consider:

- If you approve C1, does it lead to a better outcome for you than the base game?
- If you approve C2, same?

But note: **You are Player 2**, and **you care only about your own payoff**.

Also: if **you approve both**, and **Player 1 approves only one**, then whichever has more approvals wins.

But you don't know what Player 1 will do — but you can only control your own actions.

But the question says: you are to **review each contract and decide** which you approve, so that **the winning contract is selected**.

We must choose approvals such that the **contract that ends up being selected** leads to **the highest expected payoff for you**.

But only one contract is selected — so you want to **support only contract(s) that, if adopted, give you a high payoff**, and also **maximize the chance that such a contract wins**.

But since you don't know the other player’s actions, and the contract is chosen randomly from those with the **maximum number of approvals**, you need to:

- Choose a subset of contracts to approve.
- The **winning contract** is a random one among those approved by **both** players (only if both approve).
- But wait: the description says: "winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if you approve C1, and Player 1 approves C2, then:
- C1 has 1 approval (yours)
- C2 has 1 approval (Player 1's)
- Both have max approvals (1), so **one is chosen at random** between them.

But if **you approve both**, and Player 1 approves only C1, then:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 1 approval
→ C1 wins.

So your **strategy** is to choose which contracts to approve to maximize your **expected payoff**, considering that:
- The final contract is chosen randomly from the set with the **highest number of approvals**
- The highest number depends on your approval and Player 1’s approval (which you don’t control)

But since we are to **decide what you approve**, and **Player 1’s actions are unknown to us**, we must **consider best response to plausible Player 1 behavior**, or assume **rational self-interest**, since Player 1 is also trying to maximize their **own payoff**.

So we model **Player 1** as also trying to maximize **their** payoff, and thus will approve only contracts that are beneficial to **them**.

But we have to **predict** or **reason about** Player 1’s approval.

Since we are to make a **decision**, and we don't know Player 1’s move, we can assume they **will** approve contracts that help them **if they are beneficial to them**.

So we must compute, for each contract, how it affects your payoff and how it affects **Player 1’s payoff**, and then determine if **Player 1 would approve**.

Then, based on that, and your choices, we can compute your **expected utility**.

But the safest approach is to **evaluate each contract from your perspective**, and see **if it is beneficial for Player 1** to approve it — then **predict** that they will only approve if it helps them.

But let’s go step by step.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Contract C1 (Player 1’s Proposal)**

C1: If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points, distributed equally among other players → since only one other player, opponent gets 2 points.

So:
- If you choose A1 → you lose 2 points (from base), opponent gains 2
- If Player 1 chooses A1 → they lose 2, you gain 2

So the **effective payoff matrix under C1**:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | (2 - 0, 2 - 0) → (2, 2) | (0 + 2, 3 - 2) → (2, 1) |
| **You: A1**   | (3 - 2, 0 + 2) → (1, 2) | (1 - 2, 1 - 2) → (-1, -1) |

Wait — careful:

When you choose A1, you pay 2 → you lose 2
When the other player chooses A1, they pay 2 → you gain 2 (as transfer)

So:
- (A0, A0): no A1 → no payment → (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): you choose A0, opponent chooses A1 → you get 0 + 2 (from transfer) = 2 → opponent gets 3 - 2 = 1
- (A1, A0): you choose A1, opponent chooses A0 → you get 3 - 2 = 1 → opponent gets 0 + 2 = 2
- (A1, A1): both choose A1 → you get 1 - 2 = -1 → opponent gets 1 - 2 = -1

So effective payoff matrix:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | (2, 2) | (2, 1) |
| **You: A1**   | (1, 2) | (-1, -1) |

Now, what is your best response?

- If P1 plays A0:
  - You choose A0: get 2
  - You choose A1: get 1 → so prefer A0

- If P1 plays A1:
  - You choose A0: get 2
  - You choose A1: get -1 → so prefer A0

So **your best response is always A0**, regardless of what P1 does.

Now, what does this mean for P1?

P1’s payoffs:
- A0: if you play A0 → 2; if you play A1 → 2
- A1: if you play A0 → 1; if you play A1 → -1

Wait:

- (A0, A0): P1 gets 2
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 2
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 1
- (A1, A1): P1 gets -1

So P1’s payoff:
- If P1 plays A0: gets 2 regardless of your action
- If P1 plays A1: gets 1 if you play A0, -1 if you play A1

So best response: **always play A0**, because if you play A0, P1 gets 2 vs 1 or -1.

So **NE**: P1 plays A0, you play A0 → outcome: (A0, A0) → payoff (2, 2)

So under C1:
- You get **2** points
- Player 1 gets **2** points

But under the **base game**, you could have gotten 3 (via A1, A0), but only if you had coordinated.

But without coordination, multiple equilibria.

But under C1, the **only** equilibrium is (A0, A0) → both get 2.

Is that true?

Let’s check:

- You: best response is always A0 → so you play A0
- P1: best response: A0 → so plays A0

Yes, this is the only NE.

So **outcome is forced to (A0, A0)** → you get 2.

Compare to base game:

In base game, you could get 3 (if P1 plays A0 and you play A1), or 1 (if both play A1).

But without coordination, it’s uncertain.

But in the **best case**, you can get 3.

But if both players are rational and play equilibrium, **(A1, A0)** is an equilibrium → you could get 3.

But (A1, A1) is also an equilibrium.

So **your expected payoff** in base game depends on which equilibrium they reach.

But **in C1**, you are **guaranteed** 2.

So **you prefer C1 if 2 > expected base payoff**.

But in base game, you can get **3**, so **2 is worse**.

So **you would not want C1** unless 2 > expected base payoff.

But base game has two pure equilibria: (A1, A0) → you get 3; (A1, A1) → you get 1.

If players coordinate on (A1, A0), you get 3.

But if they coordinate on (A1, A1), you get 1.

Without coordination, it’s uncertain.

But if both players play best responses, **(A1, A0)** is a Nash equilibrium.

But (A1, A1) is also.

Now, is there **incentive to deviate**?

Suppose both play A1 → you are getting 1, but if you switch to A0, you get 0 → worse.

But if you **could** coordinate, you might prefer to play A1, A0 to get 3.

But without communication, (A1, A1) is safer — it’s symmetric.

But (A1, A0) gives you 3, which is better than 1.

But **you are rational** — and you know that **if P1 plays A0, you want to play A1**.

But if P1 plays A1, you want to play A1 (1 > 0) — so you play A1 regardless.

Similarly, P1, if you play A0, wants to play A0 (2 > 0), but if you play A1, wants to play A0 (3 > 1).

So both players have dominant strategies to play A1 and A0 respectively?

No: you always prefer A1 → you play A1.

P1: if you play A1, P1 prefers A0 (3 > 1) — so plays A0.

So **(A1, A0) is the unique self-enforcing equilibrium**.

So in base game, **you are likely** to get **3**.

Yes — because:
- You: if they play A0, A1 → 3; if A1, A1 → 1 → so always want A1
- P1: if you play A1, they get 3 for A0, 1 for A1 → so prefer A0
- So P1 plays A0 → you play A1 → outcome: (A1, A0) → you get 3

So **your expected payoff in base game is 3**, assuming rational play.

So under C1, you get **2**, which is **less than 3**.

So **you lose** by implementing C1.

Therefore, **you do not want C1**.

Now, what would Player 1 want?

Under C1, P1 gets **2**, as outcome is (A0, A0).

But in base game, P1 gets **0** when (A1, A0) happens — because you play A1, they play A0 → they get 0.

Wait! That’s right.

In base game:
- You play A1 (because it’s best response)
- P1 plays A0 (because best response)
→ P1 gets 0

So P1 gets **0** in base game.

Under C1, P1 gets **2**.

So **Player 1 benefits greatly from C1** — they go from 0 to 2.

So **Player 1 will want to approve C1**.

But you — you go from 3 to 2 → worse.

So **you do not want C1**.

So you should not approve C1.

---

### **Step 6: Analyze Contract C2 (Player 2’s Proposal)**

C2: If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point, transferred to the other player.

So:
- You choose A1: you lose 1, opponent gains 1
- P1 chooses A1: they lose 1, you gain 1

So effective payoff matrix:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | (2, 2) | (0+1, 3-1) → (1, 2) |
| **You: A1**   | (3-1, 0+1) → (2, 1) | (1-1, 1-1) → (0, 0) |

So:

- (A0, A0): (2, 2)
- (A0, A1): you get 1, P1 gets 2
- (A1, A0): you get 2, P1 gets 1
- (A1, A1): (0, 0)

Now, your best response:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - A0: 2
  - A1: 2 → indifferent
- If P1 plays A1:
  - A0: 1
  - A1: 0 → prefer A0

So your best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → indifferent between A0 and A1
- If P1 plays A1 → prefer A0

So **if P1 plays A1, you play A0**

But what does P1 do?

P1’s payoffs:
- A0: if you play A0 → 2; if you play A1 → 1
- A1: if you play A0 → 2; if you play A1 → 0

So P1’s payoff:
- A0: 2 if you play A0, 1 if you play A1
- A1: 2 if you play A0, 0 if you play A1

So P1 prefers A0 **regardless** of your action → because 2 > 1 and 2 > 0.

So P1 **always** plays A0.

Therefore, you face P1 playing A0.

Your best response: you get 2 for A0, 2 for A1 → so you are indifferent.

So you can play A0 or A1.

But is there a pure equilibrium?

Yes:
- (A0, A0): you play A0 → get 2; P1 plays A0 → get 2 → both are best responses → yes.
- (A1, A0): you get 2 (same as A0), P1 gets 1 → but P1 gets 1 instead of 2 → so P1 wants to switch to A0 → better. But they are already playing A0. If you play A1, P1 gets 1 → if they switch to A1, they get 0 → worse. So P1 prefers to stay on A0.

But you are indifferent.

So **two pure Nash equilibria**:
1. (A0, A0): you get 2
2. (A1, A0): you get 2

Both give you **2 points**.

So in both cases, you get **2**.

Wait — is that right?

- In (A1, A0): you choose A1, P1 chooses A0 → you get (3 - 1) = 2 → yes
- In (A0, A0): you get 2

So **you always get 2**, regardless of your choice.

But P1 gets:
- In (A0, A0): 2
- In (A1, A0): 1 (since you chose A1 → they get 1 from transfer)

So P1 prefers (A0, A0), since they get 2 > 1.

So **P1 will play A0**, and will prefer you to play A0.

But you are indifferent.

So if you play A1, P1 gets 1 → worse than 2 → so P1 prefers that you play A0.

But you don't care.

So in equilibrium, the outcome is either (A0, A0) or (A1, A0) — both give you 2.

But **since P1 prefers (A0, A0)**, and **you are indifferent**, we can assume they coordinate on (A0, A0) to avoid conflict.

But in any case, **your payoff is 2**.

So under C2, you **get 2**.

But in base game, you get **3**.

So you **lose** from C2 as well — from 3 to 2.

So **you do not want C2**.

But wait — is there a way you can get more than 2?

No — maximum you can get in C2 is 2.

But in base game, you get 3.

So both contracts **reduce your payoff**.

But let’s check **Player 1’s interest in C2**.

Under C2:
- In base game, P1 gets 0 (in (A1, A0))
- Under C2, P1 gets either 2 (if (A0, A0)) or 1 (if (A1, A0)) → so at least 1

So P1 **improves** from 0 to at least 1.

So **P1 wants C2**.

But you lose from 3 to 2.

So **you do not want either contract**?

But wait — the question is: **do you approve**?

But both reduce your payoff.

But is there a possibility that by approving a contract, you can force a better outcome?

No — the contracts are **enacted only if approved**, and then they change the game.

But in both cases, your payoff drops.

So you should **reject both**?

But let’s **double-check the base game payoff**.

Is (A1, A0) really the outcome?

Let’s simulate:

- You: if they play A0 → A1 gives 3 > 2 → best
- If they play A1 → A1 gives 1 > 0 → best
- So you play A1

- P1: if you play A1 → A0 gives 3 > 1 → best
- So P1 plays A0

Then (A1, A0) → you get 3 → yes.

So base payoff: 3.

Under C1: you get 2

Under C2: you get 2

So both reduce your payoff.

Moreover, **both are beneficial to Player 1** → so Player 1 will approve **both** C1 and C2.

But you do not want either.

So if you reject both, then:
- C1: approved by P1 only → 1 approval
- C2: approved by P1 only → 1 approval
→ max approvals = 1 → winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from {C1, C2} → you get 2 point in either case → **expected payoff: 2**

If you **approve C1**: then C1 has 2 approvals (yours + P1), C2 has 1 → C1 wins → you get 2 → same as above.

If you approve C2: C2 wins → you get 2.

If you approve both: C1 and C2 both have 2 approvals (if P1 approves both) → then one is chosen at random → you get 2 either way → still 2.

So **no matter what you do**, if P1 approves both (which they likely will, since they benefit), and you approve one or both, you end up with **expected payoff 2**.

But in the **base game**, if no contract is adopted, you get **3**.

But the problem is: **a contract must be selected**.

But if **no contract is approved by both**, then what happens?

The problem says: "the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

But if **no contract is approved by anyone**, then all have 0 approval → max is 0 → random from all → but unlikely.

But if you reject both, and P1 approves both, then both have 1 approval → max is 1 → one is chosen at random → you get 2.

But if **no contract** is approved by more than zero, then the contract with max approval is the one with 0 — multiple with 0.

But probably, the mechanism is: only contracts with **at least one approval** can be selected.

But the problem doesn't specify.

To be safe, assume that if **no contract is approved**, then **no contract** is adopted, and the base game is played.

But the problem says: "the winning contract will be selected...", implying **a contract is selected**.

So probably, **even if no contract is approved**, there is a default.

But the contract is **only selected if there is approval**.

But the problem says: "a payment contract can be put in place if players agree to it via an approval voting process."

So **only if agreement**.

But the selection mechanism is given.

So likely, if **no contract has approval**, then **no contract** is adopted.

So **base game**.

But if you **do not approve any contract**, but P1 approves both, then contracts with 1 approval (C1 and C2) are candidates, and one is chosen at random → contract is adopted.

So you only avoid the contract if **you disapprove all**, and **no contract gets approval**.

But if you disapprove both, and P1 approves both, then both C1 and C2 have 1 approval → so **one is selected at random** → contract is adopted.

The **only way** to avoid a contract is if **you and P1 approve no contract**, or if all approvals are zero.

But since P1 will likely approve C1 and C2 (because they benefit), then as long as **you approve at least one**, you have at least one contract with 2 approvals (if P1 approves it), or if you disapprove both, then C1 and C2 each have 1 approval → contract still adopted.

So **a contract will be adopted** unless **no one approves any contract**.

But since P1 is rational and will approve contracts that help them, they will approve **C1 and C2**.

Therefore, **unless you approve none**, but P1 approves both, then at least one contract is adopted — either C1 or C2, chosen at random.

So **in all scenarios**, a contract is adopted, and you get **2 points**.

But in the **base game**, you get **3**.

But the contract **must be adopted** if at least one player approves.

But if **you approve no contract**, and P1 approves both, then the contracts are still adopted — just randomly chosen.

So **you cannot avoid contracts** unless you **disapprove all and P1 disapproves all**.

But P1 will approve both C1 and C2, because they benefit.

So **you cannot avoid the contract**.

So **in all cases**, a contract is adopted → your payoff is **2**.

But if there were no contracts, you could get 3.

So **you lose**.

So **should you approve any contract?**

But you have no choice — the contract will be adopted anyway.

But the game is structured so that **either a contract is adopted or not**.

But since P1 will approve both, then **even if you approve none**, C1 and C2 will each have 1 approval → so one is selected at random → contract adopted → you get 2.

If you approve C1, then C1 has 2 approvals → wins → you get 2.

So in all cases, you get 2.

But in the **base game**, you would get 3.

So by not approving anything, you **still get 2**.

But you **cannot avoid the contract**.

But is there a way to get 3?

Only if **no contract is adopted**, but if P1 approves both, then contracts are adopted.

And P1 will approve both.

So you **cannot avoid the contract**.

Therefore, your payoff is always 2.

So it doesn't matter which contracts you approve — you end up with 2.

But the question is: **do you approve**?

But if you approve a contract, it might **increase** its chance of winning — but since you get the same payoff regardless, it doesn't matter.

But to **be consistent**, and since you **don't benefit**, and **both contracts reduce your payoff**, you should **not approve any contract**.

But you **cannot prevent** the contract from being adopted.

But your approval only affects the distribution of approvals.

But since you get 2 in any case, and there's no benefit, you might as well approve none.

But is it possible that one contract gives you **more than 2**?

No — both give you 2.

So it's neutral.

But to **maximize your expected points**, since you get at most 2, and you can't get 3, you might as well approve none.

But you might want to approve the contract that gives you **more** if there were a difference, but there isn't.

But there is a subtle point.

In C1, you get 2 (in (A0, A0))

In C2, you get 2 (in (A0, A0) or (A1, A0))

So same.

But in C1, if you play A1 and P1 plays A0, you get 1, but in C2 you get 2.

But in equilibrium, you play A0.

But still, you get 2.

So same.

Therefore, **you should not approve any contract**, because both reduce your payoff compared to base game, but since you cannot avoid the contract, you are indifferent.

But the safest is to **not approve** any.

But let's see: if you approve C2, and P1 approves C2, then C2 has 2 approvals → wins → you get 2.

Same as if you approved nothing and P1 approves C2.

So no difference.

But to be safe, we can approve neither.

But the problem is: the contract is selected from those with **maximum approval**.

If you approve C2, and P1 approves C2, then C2 has 2 approvals.

If you approve neither, C2 has 1 approval.

Then both C1 and C2 have 1 approval → winner is chosen at random.

So you have 50% chance to get C2 (your preferred), 50% chance to get C1.

But under both, you get 2.

So expected payoff: 2 in both cases.

So no difference.

Therefore, it doesn't matter.

But since both contracts reduce your payoff, and you cannot get 3, you should not approve any.

But the only way to get 3 is to **not adopt a contract**, but you can't prevent it.

So you are stuck with 2.

But for the purpose of approval, since you gain nothing and lose something compared to base game, and the base game is not offered explicitly, but we must choose.

In conclusion, **neither contract is beneficial to you**.

Therefore, you should **not approve both**.

But to not approve any might be best.

But let’s final answer.

Final decision:

- C1: you get 2 < 3 → not good → **disapprove**
- C2: you get 2 < 3 → not good → **disapprove**

Even though C2 might be slightly better if Player 1 approves it, but no, you still get 2.

But in C2, if you choose A1 and P1 chooses A0, you get 2, same as A0.

But in C1, you get 1, which is worse.

But in equilibrium, you play A0.

So same.

So approve neither.

But the output must have entries for both.

**Final Answer:**

{"C1": false, "C2": false}

response:
Based on the rules of the game and the added contract, here is the step-by-step breakdown of the decision-making process for Player 2:

1.  **Analyze the Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
    *   (A0, A0): Both get 2 points.
    *   (A0, A1): Player 2 (you) chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0. From the description: "If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3, the other player gets 0." Thus: (0, 3).
    *   (A1, A0): Player 2 (you) chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1. From the description: "If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0, the other player gets 3." Thus: (3, 0).
    *   (A1, A1): Both get 1 point.

2.  **Factor in the Contract:**
    The contract adds 2 points to any player who chooses A0, which is taken from the other player.
    *   **(A0, A0):** Player 1 chooses A0 (+2, -2 from P2), Player 2 chooses A0 (+2, -2 from P1). Final: (2 + 2 - 2, 2 + 2 - 2) = **(2, 2)**.
    *   **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 (+2, -2 from P2), Player 2 chooses A1 (no change). Final: (0 + 2, 3 - 2) = **(2, 1)**.
    *   **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1 (no change), Player 2 chooses A0 (+2, -2 from P1). Final: (3 - 2, 0 + 2) = **(1, 2)**.
    *   **(A1, A1):** Neither chooses A0. Final: **(1, 1)**.

3.  **Determine the Dominant Strategy for Player 2:**
    *   If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 2 points with A0 versus 1 point with A1.
    *   If Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 2 points with A0 versus 1 point with A1.
    In both scenarios, A0 provides a higher payoff for Player 2, making it a strictly dominant strategy.

4.  **Determine the Dominant Strategy for Player 1:**
    *   If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 2 points with A0 versus 1 point with A1.
    *   If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 2 points with A0 versus 1 point with A1.
    A0 is also the dominant strategy for Player 1.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    The contract shifts the Nash Equilibrium from (A1, A1) in the original game to (A0, A0), raising the payout for both players from 1 to 2. Since A0 is the strictly dominant strategy for maximizing points, the optimal decision is to select A0 with 100% probability.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether you should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without the contract)

This is a 2-player, simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)**   | (2,2)   | (0,3)   |
| **A1 (P1)**   | (3,0)   | (1,1)   |

This is a classic coordination game with a twist: there is a dominant strategy for each player in terms of best responses.

Let's analyze best responses:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 2 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A1
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 0 for A0, 1 for A1 → prefers A1

So **A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 1**.

Now for Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 2 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 0 for A0, 1 for A1 → prefers A1

So **A1 is also a dominant strategy for Player 2**.

Thus, without any contract, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), yielding (1,1) for both players.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract says:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 2 points**.
- This additional 2 points are **drawn equally from the other player**.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get +2 points (from Player 2).
- If Player 2 plays A0 → they get +2 points (from you).
- If you play A1 → no extra points for either.

This is **a transfer of 2 points from the other player to you if you play A0**.

So the payoff structure **with the contract** would be:

Let’s recompute all payoffs **with the contract**, considering the transfer.

Note: The contract is only active if **both players sign**. You’re asking whether to sign, so we assume the contract is active *only if you sign it* and the other player already signed (as per the setup — "selected via approval voting" — so we assume Player 2 signed).

Therefore, we assume the contract is active (i.e., both signed), and we must decide whether to sign.

---

### Step 3: Recompute payoffs with the contract

Let’s define the total payoff for Player 1 (you) in each outcome, under the contract.

Each outcome has:
- Base payoff from original game
- Plus bonus of +2 if you played A0
- Minus 2 if the other player played A0 (since you pay them 2)

Wait — clarification: “they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.”

So:
- If **you** play A0 → you get +2 points, taken from the other player → so the other player loses 2.
- If **they** play A0 → they get +2, you lose 2.

Therefore, yes — **the transfer is: every time someone plays A0, they gain 2, the other loses 2.**

So the total payoff for each player is:
> Base payoff + (2 if you played A0) - (2 if they played A0)

Let’s compute this for all four outcomes.

---

#### Case 1: You play A0, Player 2 plays A0
- Base: (2,2)
- You: +2 (because you played A0) → 2 + 2 = **4**
- Player 2: +2 (because they played A0) → 2 + 2 = **4**
- But: you pay them 2? Wait — no.

Wait, let's parse the contract again:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you** play A0 → you get +2, and **Player 2 loses 2**.
If **Player 2** plays A0 → they get +2, and **you lose 2**.

So **both effects happen simultaneously** if both play A0.

So:
- You play A0 → you gain +2
- Player 2 plays A0 → you lose 2 (because you pay 2 to Player 2 for their bonus)

So total for you: base +2 (from your action) -2 (from their action) = base +0

Similarly for Player 2:
- Base +2 (from their A0) +2 (from your A0 payment) = base +4? Wait — no.

Actually, the transfer is **from the other player**, not an extra. The contract says "drawn equally from the other players".

So:
- If you choose A0, you get +2, and **Player 2 pays 2** to you.
- If Player 2 chooses A0, they get +2, and **you pay 2** to them.

So the net effect is:
- If both play A0:
  - You get +2 (from A0), but lose 2 (to Player 2’s bonus) → net 0 change from contract.
- If you play A0, they play A1:
  - You get +2 (from your A0), they get nothing → you gain +2.
- If you play A1, they play A0:
  - You lose 2 (pay to them), they get +2 → net -2 from contract for you.
- If both play A1:
  - No one gets bonus → no effect.

So general formula:
- Your total payoff = base payoff + [2 if you played A0] - [2 if Player 2 played A0]

Let’s compute all four cases with this in mind.

---

### Revised Payoff Matrix with Contract

|               | A0 (P2)         | A1 (P2)         |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **A0 (P1)**   | Base: (2,2)     | Base: (0,3)     |
|               | You: 2 + 2 - 2 = 2 | You: 0 + 2 - 0 = 2 |
|               | P2: 2 + 2 - 2 = 2 | P2: 3 + 0 - 0 = 3 |
| **A1 (P1)**   | Base: (3,0)     | Base: (1,1)     |
|               | You: 3 + 0 - 2 = 1 | You: 1 + 0 - 0 = 1 |
|               | P2: 0 + 2 - 0 = 2 | P2: 1 + 0 - 0 = 1 |

So the **new payoff matrix** is:

|               | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)**   | (2,2)   | (2,3)   |
| **A1 (P1)**   | (1,2)   | (1,1)   |

Now, analyze your best responses.

You are Player 1.

- If P2 plays A0:
  - You get 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - You get 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is now a dominant strategy for you**.

Wait — that’s a big change.

Previously, you had dominant strategy A1. Now, with the contract, **A0 dominates**.

Similarly, check Player 2's incentives:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0

So P2 has **no dominant strategy** — depends on your action.

But for **you (Player 1)**, A0 is **strictly better** than A1 in both cases.

So your best response is always A0.

Thus, if you sign the contract, your optimal action is A0 (regardless of what Player 2 does).

---

### Step 4: What happens if you sign vs not sign?

We need to compare your **expected total points** in the two scenarios.

But — the contract only becomes active if **both** sign.

You are being asked: **should you sign?**

So we need to consider:
- If you sign: contract is active, and you can play optimally (A0), and you expect Player 2 to respond optimally as well.

- If you do **not** sign: the contract is off, and the game reverts to original (no contract), where both will play A1 (dominant strategy), giving (1,1).

So:
- If you **do not sign** → game is classical: (A1, A1) → you get **1 point**

- If you **sign** → contract active → you can play A0, and since A0 is dominant, you will play A0.

But what will Player 2 do?

Player 2 is rational and knows this.

Let’s analyze Player 2’s best response to your A0.

From the new matrix:
- If you play A0:
  - P2 gets 2 (if they play A0) vs 3 (if they play A1) → so they will choose A1

So: if you sign and play A0, P2 will play A1.

So outcome: (A0, A1)

Your payoff: from matrix → 2 points

Player 2 gets 3.

So if you **sign**, you get 2 points.

If you **do not sign**, you get 1 point.

So **2 > 1**, so signing gives you more.

Wait — but is the contract **binding** in your favor?

Yes — the contract gives you a benefit when you play A0.

But we must be careful: the contract only applies if **both players sign**.

But you are considering signing, and assuming the other player already signed (since it passed approval voting).

So yes, contract is in effect.

So your strategy becomes:
- You play A0 (dominant)
- Player 2 responds optimally: A1 (since they get 3 > 2 when you play A0)
- You end up with 2 points

So your payoff: **2**

If you don’t sign: you get **1** point

So clearly, you are better off signing.

---

### Step 5: Could Player 2 be bluffing? Do you trust their signing?

The contract was selected via approval voting — implying **Player 2 signed**.

So it’s safe to assume they signed.

Therefore, the contract is active.

So with contract active, you can achieve 2 points by playing A0.

Without contract, you get only 1.

Therefore, signing is beneficial.

---

### Step 6: Is there a downside?

What if Player 2 also changes strategy? But we already assumed they are rational.

They want to maximize their own points.

In (A0, A1): P2 gets 3 — which is better than 2 (if they played A0) → so they prefer it.

No incentive to play A0.

So (A0, A1) is the outcome.

You get 2.

Perfect.

Even if they misplay, you get at least 2 (since A0 is better than A1 regardless).

So **no downside**.

---

### Conclusion:

- Not signing: you get 1 point (equilibrium outcome)
- Signing: you get 2 points (in your strategy — optimal play leads to outcome with 2 points)

Yes, you benefit from the contract.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without contract)

The game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

This is a modified version of a coordination game with a payoff structure similar to the "Chicken" game or a "Coordination with temptation" game.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria of the original game.

- (A0, A0): both get 2 — stable if neither wants to deviate.
  - If P1 deviates to A1, gets 3 > 2 → so P1 wants to deviate.
  - So (A0, A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium.

- (A1, A1): both get 1.
  - If P1 deviates to A0, gets 0 < 1 → won’t deviate.
  - If P2 deviates to A0, gets 0 < 1 → won’t deviate.
  - So (A1, A1) **is** a Nash equilibrium.

- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3.
  - P1 would prefer to switch to A1 → gets 1 > 0 → deviation profitable.
  - Not a Nash equilibrium.

- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0.
  - P2 would prefer to switch to A1 → gets 1 > 0 → deviation profitable.
  - Not a Nash equilibrium.

So the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) → both play A1, getting 1 point each.

Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:

Let P1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p).  
Let P2 play A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q).

To find mixed strategy equilibrium:

Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 when:
- EU(A0) = 2*q + 0*(1−q) = 2q
- EU(A1) = 3*q + 1*(1−q) = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1

Set equal:  
2q = 2q + 1 → 0 = 1 → contradiction.

So no q makes player 1 indifferent — this suggests that **there is no mixed strategy equilibrium in which Player 1 is indifferent**? Wait — let’s double-check.

Wait: EU for P1:
- If P1 plays A0: gets 2 with prob q, 0 with (1−q) → expected payoff = 2q
- If P1 plays A1: gets 3 with prob q, 1 with (1−q) → expected payoff = 3q + 1(1−q) = 2q + 1

Set equal:  
2q = 2q + 1 → 0 = 1 → impossible.

So there is **no value of q** that makes P1 indifferent. Since 2q + 1 > 2q for all q, P1 **always prefers A1** regardless of P2's strategy.

Similarly, check for P2:

- If P2 plays A0: payoff = 2p + 0(1−p) = 2p
- If P2 plays A1: payoff = 3p + 1(1−p) = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1

Again, 2p + 1 > 2p → P2 **always prefers A1**.

So in the original game:
- Regardless of what the opponent does, **both players strictly prefer A1**.
- Therefore, (A1, A1) is the **only** Nash equilibrium, and it's a dominant strategy equilibrium.

Thus, without the contract, **both players will play A1**, and each gets 1 point.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract proposal

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 1 point, **drawn equally from the other players**.
>
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So, if **you play A0**, you get +1 point (from a "tax" on the other player).  
But the contract says "drawn equally from the other players" — so since there are two players, and you are getting +1, that means the other player loses 1 point (because it's "drawn from" them).

So the **net effect** of the contract is:

- If *you* choose A0 → you gain +1, opponent loses 1.
- If *you* choose A1 → nothing changes.

But crucially: **this only applies if the contract is signed by both players**, because the contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

So if you sign, and the other player signs, then the above rules apply.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the game **with** the contract, assuming both sign it.

Now the payoffs change!

We can compute the new payoff matrix *for you (Player 1)* and the other player (Player 2), **when both have signed the contract**.

Recall:
- A0 gives +1 to the player who plays it, -1 to the opponent.
- A1 gives no extra.

So the **adjusted payoffs** become:

|               | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (2+1, 2−1) = (3,1) | (0+1, 3−1) = (1,2) |
| **P1: A1**    | (3−1, 0+1) = (2,1) | (1,1)         |

Let me explain:

- (A0, A0): you get 2 (original) +1 (contract) = 3; opponent gets 2 (original) −1 = 1 → (3,1)
- (A0, A1): you get 0 +1 = 1; opponent gets 3 −1 = 2 → (1,2)
- (A1, A0): you get 3 −1 = 2; opponent gets 0 +1 = 1 → (2,1)
- (A1, A1): both get no extra → (1,1)

So the new payoff matrix (with contract) is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (3,1)  | (1,2)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (2,1)  | (1,1)  |

Now analyze this game.

Look at **your** payoffs (Player 1):

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets: 3 (if A0), 2 (if A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets: 1 (if A0), 1 (if A1) → indifferent

So P1 prefers A0 if P2 plays A0, and is indifferent otherwise.

Now P2’s payoffs:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets: 1 (if A0), 2 (if A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets: 1 (if A0), 1 (if A1) → indifferent

So P2 prefers A1 if P1 plays A0, indifferent otherwise.

Now check for Nash equilibria.

Try (A0, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 2
- P1: if switches to A1, gets 1 → no change → indifferent
- P2: if switches to A0, gets 1 < 2 → won’t switch
→ P1 might be willing to stay, P2 won’t deviate → **Nash equilibrium?**

But P1 is indifferent — so (A0, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

Try (A1, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 1
- P1: switch to A0, gets 1 → indifferent → might stay
- P2: switch to A0, gets 1 → no benefit → stays
→ also a Nash equilibrium

Try (A0, A0): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 1
- P1: if switches to A1, gets 2 < 3 → won't deviate
- P2: if switches to A1, gets 2 > 1 → wants to deviate
→ not a Nash equilibrium

Try (A1, A0): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 1
- P1: switch to A0 → gets 3 > 2 → wants to deviate
→ not a Nash equilibrium

So only two Nash equilibria: (A0, A1) and (A1, A1)

But note: in (A0, A1), **you (P1)** get 1 point.

In (A1, A1), **you** get 1 point.

Same payoff.

But is there a way to do better?

Wait: P1 gets 1 in both equilibria.

But in (A0, A1), P2 gets 2 — so P2 might prefer that.

But since P2 is rational, they’d prefer to play A1 if P1 plays A0.

Similarly, P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 when P2 plays A1.

So P1 has a strict incentive to play A0 **only if** P2 plays A0.

But if P1 plays A0, P2 will switch to A1 (since 2 > 1).

So if P1 plays A0 → P2 best response is A1 → outcome is (A0, A1) → P1 gets 1.

Alternatively, if P1 plays A1 → P2 is indifferent, but can play either.

But if P2 plays A1, outcome is (A1, A1), P1 gets 1.

So no matter what, P1 gets only 1.

Wait — in (A0, A1), P1 gets 1.

But what if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1? That gives **1** for you.

But in the **original game** (without contract), you also get 1.

So under contract, your **expected payoff is still 1** in the equilibria.

But wait: is there any outcome where you get more?

Only (A0, A0) gives you 3 — but that’s not sustainable, because P2 will deviate.

So in the **best-case coordinated outcome**, you can get 3 — but only if both play A0 — but P2 has no incentive to play A0, since they get only 1 vs 2 if they play A1.

So rational players will not play (A0, A0).

Therefore, **your expected payoff under the contract, assuming both sign**, will be **at most 1**, and likely 1 in equilibrium.

But what if you can **commit** to play A0?

But no — it’s simultaneous.

So the best you can expect is 1 in equilibrium.

But in the **original game**, you also get 1.

So why would you want to sign?

Wait — **only** if you can get more than 1.

But you can't.

But here’s a crucial point: in the **contracted game**, **if you play A0**, you get +1 from the contract.

But you need the other player to also sign the contract to get that benefit.

But the key point is: **you have to decide whether to sign the contract.**

If you don't sign, and the other player signs, then the contract is **not active**, because it requires **all** players to sign.

So the contract only applies **if both sign**.

Therefore, if you sign, you must assume the other player may or may not.

But the question is: **Should you sign the contract, knowing that it only takes effect if both sign?**

But the contract was "proposed by Player 1" and "selected via approval voting" — but we are **Player 1**, and we are being asked whether to sign.

So: we are deciding whether to **sign** the contract.

But the contract becomes active **only if all players sign**.

Therefore:
- If **you sign**, and the **other player does not**, then the contract is **not active**, and nothing changes.
- If **both sign**, then the contract becomes active, and the modified payoffs apply.

But you don't know whether the other player will sign — but the game is about your strategy.

We are to decide **whether to sign** — based on expected payoff.

But the decision tree:

1. You choose to sign or not.
2. The other player chooses to sign or not.
3. Then both choose actions simultaneously.

So you must consider the outcome based on all possibilities.

But we don't have information about the other player’s preferences.

But we can assume rationality.

Let’s assume both players are rational and try to maximize their own points.

So we can model this as a **signing game**.

But we need to ask: what is your best response?

Let’s suppose you are considering whether to sign.

Case 1: **You don’t sign the contract.**

Then the contract does **not** activate **regardless of what the other player does**.

So the game returns to the **original** payoff structure.

As we saw earlier: in the original game, **playing A1 is a dominant strategy** for both players.

So both will play A1.

You get **1 point**.

Case 2: **You sign the contract.**

Then the outcome depends on whether the other player signs.

Subcase 2a: Other player **does not sign**.

Then the contract is **not active** → we are back to original game.

You still play A1 (dominant), get 1 point.

Subcase 2b: Other player **signs**.

Then contract is active → we play under **contracted payoffs**.

In that case, as analyzed, the best outcomes yield **1 point for you** (in equilibria).

So in **both subcases**, if you sign, you still get **1 point**, assuming rational opponents.

But in Case 2b, could you get more?

Only if both play A0 → you get 3.

But for that to happen: you must play A0, and P2 must play A0.

But P2 will play A0 only if they think it's beneficial.

In the contracted game, P2's payoffs are:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 1 (if A0), 2 (if A1) → so P2 strictly prefers A1
- So P2 will **never** play A0 if P1 plays A0.

So P2 will only play A0 if P1 plays A1? But even then, P2 is indifferent.

But no incentive to play A0.

So (A0, A0) is unstable.

So it’s impossible for both to play A0.

Therefore, **no outcome with payoff >1 for you** is stable.

Thus, under the contract, your expected payoff is still **1 point**, same as in the original.

So signing the contract **gives no benefit** — you get the same 1 point either way.

But wait — is there a risk?

In fact, **signing the contract doesn't hurt you**, because if the other player doesn't sign, the contract is inactive, and you’re back to original game — still get 1.

If the other player signs, you get 1 again.

So signing doesn’t reduce your payoff.

But does it increase it?

No — still 1.

But is there a possibility of coordination on A0?

Not under rational play.

So **zero net gain**.

But here’s a critical twist: **you are Player 1**, and **you proposed the contract**.

And the question is: do you sign?

But since signing doesn’t hurt you, and doesn't help you, is there any reason not to sign?

Wait — what if the other player is uncertain?

But we must assume rationality.

Alternatively, could the contract **induce** coordination?

In the contracted game, your payoffs are:
- If you play A0, you get 3 or 1 → depends on opponent
- If you play A1, you get 2 or 1

So compared to original:
- Original: A0 → 2 or 0
- Contracted: A0 → 3 or 1 (better in both cases!)
- A1 → original: 3 or 1 → contracted: 2 or 1 → **worse** when opponent plays A0

Wait a second — this is important.

In contracted game:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - You get 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - You get 1 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → indifferent

So **playing A0 is weakly better**, and strictly better when P2 plays A0.

So **in the contracted game**, A0 is **weakly better** than A1.

But earlier we said P2 will never play A0? Actually, P2’s incentives:

P2’s payoffs in contracted game:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 1 (A0) or 2 (A1) → so P2 prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) or 1 (A1) → indifferent

So P2 will play A1 unless forced.

So if you play A1, P2 is indifferent — could play A0 or A1.

But if you play A0, P2 definitely plays A1.

So your best is still to play A1 and hope P2 plays A1 → get 1.

But wait — is there any way to get more than 1?

No.

But now notice: **by signing the contract, you make A0 a better option for you in all cases**, especially if you believe P2 might play A0.

But P2 won’t play A0 unless they’re indifferent — but they’re not.

So still, no gain.

But could the contract allow **coordination on A0**? Only if both are willing.

But P2 has no incentive to play A0 — they always get 2 (in A1) when you play A0, but only 1 in A0.

So no.

Thus, **the contract does not improve your expected payoff**.

But is there any downside?

Only if the other player signs, and you don’t, then the contract doesn’t apply — but if you both sign, you play under new rules.

But you get 1 either way.

But here’s a **key observation**: in the **original game**, A1 is dominant, so both play A1 → you get 1.

In the **contracted game**, A0 is weakly dominant — because it gives you better payoff than A1 in at least one case, and same in another.

Let’s check:

In contracted game:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - A0 gives you 3, A1 gives 2 → A0 better
- If P2 plays A1:
  - A0 gives 1, A1 gives 1 → same

So A0 is **weakly dominant** for you.

Similarly for P2? No.

P2:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 1, A1 gives 2 → A1 better
- If P1 plays A1: both give 1 → indifferent

So P2 will always play A1 if P1 plays A0, and indifferent if not.

So if you play A0 → P2 plays A1 → you get 1

If you play A1 → P2 is indifferent → could play A1 or A0

But P2 will play A1 (since it’s better if you play A0, and same if not) → so best to play A1

Thus, P2 will play A1 regardless.

So if you play A0: P2 responds with A1 → you get 1

If you play A1: P2 plays A1 → you get 1

So outcome is always (A0,A1) or (A1,A1) → you get 1 in both cases.

So **no gain**.

Therefore, **signing the contract provides no benefit to you** — your expected payoff remains 1.

But you don’t lose either.

So should you sign?

But here’s a **crucial point**: if you **do not sign**, and the other player **does sign**, then the contract is **not activated**, so you get 1 (original game: A1 vs A1).

If you **do sign**, and the other player **does sign**, then the contract is active, and you still get 1.

So **same outcome**.

But is there any incentive for the other player to sign?

Let’s suppose you sign. Then the other player faces:

- If they sign: contract active → they play under contracted payoffs.
- If they don’t: contract not active → they play original game.

In the original game, they get 1 by playing A1.

In the contracted game, if they sign, and you sign, then P2's payoffs:

- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 1 (if A0), 2 (if A1) → so prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: gets 1 (A0), 1 (A1) → indifferent

So they will play A1 no matter what.

So they get 2 (if P1 plays A0) or 1 (if P1 plays A1)

But if you play A0, they get 2 → better than 1

But you are not playing A0 yet.

But in the equilibrium, you both play A1 → they get 1.

But if you play A0, they get 2.

But they won’t know what you play — it’s simultaneous.

But from their view: if they sign, they can **potentially** get more.

But only if you play A0.

But if they don’t sign, the game is original — they get 1.

So if they sign, they might get more (if you play A0), but if you play A1, they get the same.

So **if they believe you might play A0, they might prefer to sign** to get the chance to get 2.

But in the **contracted game**, you are **indifferent** between A0 and A1 if P2 plays A1.

But in the original game, you prefer A1.

But if you sign the contract, you have **no incentive** to play A0 — you get same payoff.

But now for P2: if they sign, and you sign, and if you play A1, they get 1, same as original.

If you play A0, they get 2, better.

So they might prefer to sign to have a chance to get 2.

But the risk is that if you play A1, they still get 1.

So from P2’s perspective: signing the contract gives them a **chance** to get more, but no downside.

So they will **want to sign**.

But you don’t know.

But the point is: **you are Player 1**, and you are deciding whether to sign.

If you sign, it increases the chance that the contract activates, and you might get **same** payoff.

But you also **get no additional benefit**.

But since **signing doesn't hurt you**, and might help others (P2) to sign, but you don’t care about P2.

So from your point of view: **your payoff is 1 in all cases**.

But there’s one more consideration: **could you do better?**

In the original game, you get 1.

In the contracted game, you get 1.

But suppose in the contracted game, P2 signs, and you sign — and you both play A0? But P2 won’t, because they get 1 if they play A0, 2 if A1 when you play A0.

So no.

So no gain.

But here's a key insight: **without the contract, you get 1. With the contract, you still get 1. So no change.**

But is there a possibility that the contract allows **coordinating on A0**?

Only if both prefer it.

But in the contracted game, P2 does **not** prefer A0, since they get 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) when you play A0.

So no.

Therefore, **the contract does not improve your payoff**.

But could it hurt?

Only if you are forced to play differently.

But no — you can still play A1.

So no.

Thus, **signing the contract has no negative effect**, and no positive effect.

But the question is: should you sign?

Since it doesn't hurt, and might help if P2 signs and you can coordinate — but you can’t — and you get same payoff.

But there's one more point: **you are the proposer**, and the contract was selected via approval voting.

But you are still deciding to sign.

But perhaps you should sign **to encourage cooperation**.

But the goal is to **maximize your points**, not to promote cooperation.

And since **you don't gain**, and don't lose, but there's no benefit, you might as well not sign.

But if you don't sign, and the other player does sign, then contract is inactive → you get 1.

If you do sign, and they do sign, you get 1.

Same.

But if you sign, you might be able to **commit** to A0, but you can't — it's simultaneous.

No difference.

But there’s a **subtle point**: in the contracted game, **playing A0 is weakly better than A1** for you.

So if you believe P2 might coordinate on A0, you might want to play A0.

But P2 won't, because they don't benefit.

So no.

Therefore, **no strategic advantage**.

But since signing doesn't hurt you, and doesn't prevent you from getting 1, it’s **at least as good**.

But is there any case where signing **helps**?

Suppose the other player is **not rational** and might play A0.

But we assume rationality.

Under rational play, **you get 1 regardless**.

So **signing has no effect on your payoff**.

But since it doesn’t hurt, you might as well sign.

But the question is: **should you sign?**

And since the **contract gives no benefit** and no risk, and you are the proposer, perhaps you should sign to make it active.

But from your point of view: **no gain**.

But let’s think from the **contract perspective**.

The contract says: if you choose A0, you get +1 from the other player.

But in the **original game**, if you play A0 and P2 plays A0, you get 2.

In the **contracted game**, you get 3.

So in that case, you gain 1.

But you can only achieve that if both play A0.

But P2 won’t play A0.

So you never get it.

Therefore, the contract **does not help you** in practice.

So **you should not sign**, because signing means you are locked into a system that gives you no benefit, and you could have just played the original game.

But technically, signing doesn't hurt.

However, since there is **no benefit**, and you are trying to **maximize payoff**, and the payoff is the same whether you sign or not, but you could avoid the complexity, you might as well **not sign**.

But wait — there is a **potential psychological effect**, but we assume rationality.

Final analysis: **signing the contract does not increase your expected payoff under rational play**, and you can achieve 1 either way.

But in the contracted game, **you have a weak incentive to play A0**, but it doesn’t lead to higher payoff.

So no reason to sign.

But actually, in both cases, you get 1.

So it’s indifferent.

But is there any scenario where signing could hurt?

For example, if you sign, and the other player signs, and then you are forced to play differently — but no, you can still play A1.

So no.

Therefore, **signing is weakly better off** — it doesn’t hurt.

But since there's no gain, and the act of signing is costless, and might encourage the other player to sign (if they see you signed), which could be beneficial.

But in this setup, the other player doesn't care about you — they want to maximize their own points.

And if they sign, they don't get more — in fact, they might get less if you play A0.

But they get at least 1.

But in the original game, they get 1.

So their incentive to sign is low.

But if they believe you might play A0, they might prefer to sign to get 2.

But you won’t play A0.

So no.

Therefore, the other player has **no incentive to sign**, because signing gives them a chance to get 2 (if you play A0) but only if you play A0, which you won't.

So they won't sign.

Therefore, if you sign, the other player likely won't, so contract not active.

So you get 1.

If you don’t sign, contract not active, you get 1.

Same.

So no difference.

But since there is **no downside**, and the contract might be a way to signal willingness to cooperate, but you don’t care, and your objective is to maximize points.

And points are the same.

But if the other player signs, the contract is active, and you can’t get more.

So you get the same.

Therefore, **you are indifferent**.

But in such cases, since signing has no cost and no benefit, and you are the proposer, you might choose to sign to make it active.

But the question is: **should you sign to maximize your points?**

And since your points are the same regardless, you can **choose either**.

But the problem asks you to decide.

But let’s think: if you **don't sign**, the contract is inactive.

If you **sign**, and the other player doesn't, still inactive.

If you sign, and they sign, then active.

But since they have no incentive to sign, they won’t.

So the contract will not be active.

Therefore, **signing is essentially pointless**.

Because the other player has no reason to sign.

So the contract will not be active.

Therefore, signing has **no effect**.

So you get 1.

Nonetheless, you may as well not sign, to avoid any commitment.

But it's not commitment.

Final decision: since you gain nothing, and there's no reason to expect the other player to sign (because they get no benefit), and you can't achieve better, you should **not sign** — because it doesn't help.

But actually, signing doesn't hurt, but it also doesn't help.

But the safest answer is to **not sign**, because the other player will not sign, so it's wasted.

But the problem doesn't say you know what the other player will do.

But under rational play, **if you sign, the other player will not sign**, because they get no benefit.

So contract not active.

You get 1.

If you don't sign, you get 1.

So same.

But you have already decided not to sign.

Wait — no decision.

In the end, **your payoff is unaffected by signing**.

But the contract might be designed to induce A0 play, but it doesn't work.

Therefore, **you should not sign** — because it provides no benefit.

Alternatively, you could sign.

But since the only way to benefit is if the other player signs, and they won't, because the contract is not better for them (in fact, when you play A0, they get only 1 from A0, 2 from A1, so they are worse off if they play A0), so they will not want to sign.

Therefore, the probability that the contract becomes active is zero.

So signing has no effect.

Thus, **you should not sign** — because it doesn't help.

But is there a small chance they sign?

No — rational player will not sign if it doesn't benefit them.

So they won't.

Therefore, signing is a waste.

So final answer: **do not sign**.

But let’s double-check: if the other player signs, do they get any advantage?

- If you don't sign, contract not active.
- If you sign, and they sign, contract active.

In active contract:
- If you play A1, they get 1.
- If you play A0, they get 2.

But they are not playing A0.

In equilibrium, they play A1, so they get 1.

In the original game, they also get 1.

So no gain.

And they might get worse if they play A0.

So they have no incentive to sign.

Therefore, **they will not sign**.

So contract will not be active.

Therefore, signing your signature is pointless.

So you should not sign.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

This is a two-player simultaneous move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1’s payoff first, Player 2’s second):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (2, 2)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

This is a classic coordination game with a conflict between cooperation (both A0) and exploitation (A1 when opponent plays A0), but with a penalty for mutual A1.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract states:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **2 points**, **drawn equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is **no additional payment**.

Important clarifications:

- "Drawn equally from the other players" — since there are only two players, "the other players" means **the other player**.
- So, if **you** choose A0, you get +2 points, and your opponent **loses 2 points** (because the 2 points are taken from them).
- If **you** choose A1, no transfer occurs.

This means:
- Choosing A0 gives you +2 (from the contract) **regardless** of what the other player does — but it **costs the other player 2 points**.
- So the contract **penalizes the opponent** when **you** play A0.

---

### **Step 3: Adjust the payoff matrix to include the contract**

Let’s compute the **total final payoff** for Player 1 (you), under the contract.

**Let’s denote the base payoff (from the original game) as P_base. Then, total payoff = P_base + (contract bonus if you chose A0)**

Important: The contract bonus is **2 points to you** if you choose A0, but **this is not a bonus in addition to the base game** — rather, it comes **at the expense of the other player**. So the base game payoff already includes how the points are allocated — the contract modifies it by transferring points.

So we need to **redefine the full payoff matrix**, including the contract.

Let’s build a new matrix where the payoffs are:

- Payoff for Player 1: (base payoff from original game) + (2 if you played A0, else 0)
- Payoff for Player 2: (base payoff from original game) - (2 if you played A0, else 0), because the 2 points were taken from them.

Note: The contract is symmetric — but since it only applies when **a player chooses A0**, and it’s applied **per player**, we must remember:

- If both choose A0: each gets +2 from the contract? But wait — does the contract say "from the other players", so if you choose A0, you take 2 from the other player.

So: **Each player independently gains 2 if they play A0, at the expense of the other**.

So if both play A0:
- Player 1 gets +2 (from contract), Player 2 gets +2 (from contract)
- But the contract says: “drawn equally from the other players” — so **if two players both play A0**, then:
  - Player 1 gets 2 from Player 2
  - Player 2 gets 2 from Player 1
- So it’s **mutual transfer**: each gets +2 from the other, netting +2 for each.

Wait — but if Player 1 takes 2 from Player 2, and Player 2 takes 2 from Player 1, then:
- Net: Player 1 gets +2 from contract, Player 2 also gets +2 from contract.
- So **both get +2**.

But is that consistent with the wording?

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."

"Equally" — the other players are only one (Player 2). So "drawn equally" = directly from that one other player.

So yes — each player who plays A0 takes 2 from the other.

So if both play A0, each takes 2 from the other → net +2 for each.

Similarly:
- If only Player 1 plays A0, Player 1 gets +2, Player 2 loses 2.
- If only Player 2 plays A0, Player 2 gets +2, Player 1 loses 2.
- If no one plays A0: nothing changes.

So we now revise the payoff matrix **after including the contract effect**.

Let’s compute full payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2.

---

### **Revised Payoff Matrix (with contract)**

#### Case 1: You (P1) A0, Opponent (P2) A0

- Base: (2, 2)
- Contract:
  - P1 gets +2 (because P1 played A0)
  - P2 gets +2 (because P2 played A0)
- But this creates a net transfer: P1 gains 2 from P2, P2 gains 2 from P1 → so both get +2
- So final:
  - P1: 2 + 2 = 4
  - P2: 2 + 2 = 4

Wait — but is the "additional payment" **in addition to** the base, or **replaces** the base?

No: the contract says "receive an additional payment of 2 points", so it’s **in addition to** the base payoff.

But since it’s "drawn from the other players", it must come from their pool.

So the total sum of points across both players may change.

Let’s think carefully.

Suppose in base game, total points = 4 for (A0,A0).

Now contract: P1 takes 2 from P2 → so P1 gets 2 + 2 = 4, P2 gets 2 - 2 = 0.

But P2 also played A0 → so P2 gets 2 from the contract, but only if they **receive** it from P1.

So the **net effect**:
- P1 gets 2 (from contract) from P2
- P2 gets 2 (from contract) from P1

So total:
- P1: base 2 + +2 (from contract) = 4
- P2: base 2 + +2 (from contract) = 4
- But money was transferred: 2 from P1 to P2 (from P1's side), and 2 from P2 to P1 (from P2's side) → so **net zero transfer**.

This implies: both players gain 2 in the contract, **regardless of what the other does** — because each gets their own +2 **from the other**.

Wait — but the wording: “drawn equally from the other players.”

If there are two players, and you play A0, you get 2 points drawn **equally from the other players**.

Since there’s only one other player, you get 2 points from them.

So yes: if you play A0, you **gain 2** from the opponent.

If opponent plays A0, they gain 2 from you.

So in (A0,A0):
- You gain 2 from opponent
- Opponent gains 2 from you
- So net: both get +2 in contract

Thus, **total points** in the game increase by 4 (2 for each), but they're just transferred back and forth.

So final payoffs:
- P1: base + 2 (contract) = 2 + 2 = 4
- P2: base + 2 (contract) = 2 + 2 = 4

But this feels odd — the contract is not a net transfer, but rather a mutual gain?

Wait: if each gets 2 **from** the other, then yes — net zero change in total, but both are richer.

But let's verify:

- P1: gets 2 from P2 (because P1 played A0)
- P2: gets 2 from P1 (because P2 played A0)
- So P1 ends up with: base 2 + 2 (from P2) = 4
- P2 ends up with: base 2 + 2 (from P1) = 4

So total: 8 points, whereas base was 4 → **point creation**?

But that breaks the idea of transfer. It can't be that both gain 2 from each other unless it's magic.

Ah — here's the mistake.

The contract says: **you receive 2 points, drawn from the other players.**

So if you play A0, you **get 2**, and that money comes **from the other player**.

So if **both** play A0, then:
- P1 gets 2, which comes from P2
- P2 gets 2, which comes from P1
- So each **gains 2**, but each also **loses 2** → net change: 0?

Wait no: the contract is **applied per player**.

Let’s suppose the contract is designed as:

- Each time a player plays A0, they receive a 2-point bonus from the other player.

So:
- If P1 plays A0: receives 2 from P2
- If P2 plays A0: receives 2 from P1

So in (A0, A0):
- P1 gains 2 (from P2), and P2 gains 2 (from P1) → so both get +2
- So P1’s total: base 2 + 2 = 4
- P2’s total: base 2 + 2 = 4

But where did the 2 come from? The points are just created? Or is it a transfer?

Actually, if both get +2 from the other, it’s like a **reciprocal transfer**: each gives 2 to the other → so **net change for each is zero**.

But they **still each receive 2** — so their total is base + 2.

Thus, the contract **adds 2 to your payoff if you play A0**, regardless of what the other does.

So the key point is: **your payoff is increased by 2 if you choose A0, and it is taken directly from the other player.**

But if the other player also chooses A0, they **also get +2** from you, so they **lose 2 to you**, but **gain 2 from you** → net zero?

Wait, no.

Let’s formalize:

Let B be the base payoff.

Let C be the contract adjustment.

- If you play A0 → you gain +2
- That +2 comes from the other player → so the other player loses 2

But — if the other player plays A0 → they also gain +2 from *you* → so you lose 2 to them.

So if both play A0:
- You gain 2 (from P2) but lose 2 (to P2) → net 0
- Similarly for P2

So no net change?

Wait — that’s only if both are doing it.

Let’s define:

For Player 1:
- If you play A0: you gain 2 (from P2) — so +2
- But if P2 plays A0: P2 gains 2 from you — so you **lose 2** to P2

So net effect of contract on P1:
- +2 (if P1 plays A0)
- -2 (if P2 plays A0)

So P1’s contract bonus = 2 if P1 plays A0, minus 2 if P2 plays A0.

Similarly for P2.

Thus, net contract bonus for P1:
- +2 if P1 plays A0
- -2 if P2 plays A0

So total contract effect = 2 × (I_P1_A0 - I_P2_A0)

Similarly, P2’s contract effect = 2 × (I_P2_A0 - I_P1_A0)

Thus, total contract effect: 0 → total points unchanged.

But each player’s **individual** payoff changes.

Therefore, the **final payoff for Player 1** is:

> Base payoff (from game) + 2 × I_(P1 plays A0) - 2 × I_(P2 plays A0)

Similarly for Player 2.

That’s the correct interpretation.

Because:
- You get +2 if you play A0 (from opponent)
- But you lose 2 if opponent plays A0 (because they get +2 from you)

So the net contract effect depends on **both **(your action and opponent’s)

---

### **Step 4: Compute full payoff matrix with contract**

Let’s build a matrix for Player 1’s total payoff (you).

| P1 \ P2 | A0              | A1              |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **A0** | (2 + 2 - 2) = 2 | (0 + 2 - 0) = 2 |
| **A1** | (3 + 0 - 2) = 1 | (1 + 0 - 0) = 1 |

Explanation:

- (A0, A0): base = 2; you played A0 → +2; opponent played A0 → -2 → total = 2 + 2 - 2 = **2**
- (A0, A1): base = 0; you played A0 → +2; opponent played A1 → 0 → total = 0 + 2 = **2**
- (A1, A0): base = 3; you played A1 → 0; opponent played A0 → -2 → total = 3 - 2 = **1**
- (A1, A1): base = 1; you played A1 → 0; opponent played A1 → 0 → total = 1

So the updated payoff matrix for Player 1 is:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | 2  | 2  |
| **A1** | 1  | 1  |

And similarly, we can compute for Player 2 (but we care only about Player 1).

Wait — this is interesting.

Player 1’s payoff is **2** if choosing A0 (regardless of opponent),
and **1** if choosing A1 (regardless of opponent).

So **A0 is always better** for Player 1 in terms of payoff.

That is: no matter what the other player does, you get 2 if you play A0, and 1 if you play A1.

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1, **after including the contract**.

---

### **Step 5: What’s the optimal strategy?**

Since A0 gives 2 regardless of the other player’s choice,
and A1 gives 1 regardless of the other player’s choice,

**A0 is strictly dominant**.

So the best response for Player 1 is to always play A0.

Even if the other player plays A1, you get 2 from A0, vs 1 from A1.

Even if the other player plays A0, you get 2 from A0 (after contract correction), vs 1 from A1.

Thus, **maximum expected payoff is 2**, achieved by playing A0 always.

So the optimal strategy is: **play A0 with probability 100%**

---

### **Step 6: Output the required JSON**

We must output a JSON with:
- Keys: "A0", "A1"
- Values: integers in percentage points summing to 100
- Since we recommend always playing A0: 100% A0, 0% A1

---

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game without the contract

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): I get 2, opponent gets 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 1, opponent gets 1

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma. A1 is the dominant strategy for both players, leading to the Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) with payoffs (1, 1).

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds a transfer: if a player chooses A0, they receive +1 point from the other player.

New payoffs (Player 2, Player 1):
- **(A0, A0)**: Base (2, 2) + I get 1 from opponent - I pay 1 to opponent = **(2, 2)**
- **(A0, A1)**: Base (0, 3) + I get 1 from opponent = **(1, 2)**
- **(A1, A0)**: Base (3, 0) - I pay 1 to opponent = **(2, 1)**
- **(A1, A1)**: Base (1, 1) = **(1, 1)**

## Step 3: Analyze the strategic situation with the contract

From my perspective:
- If opponent plays A0: I get 2 with A0, or 2 with A1 → **indifferent**
- If opponent plays A1: I get 1 with A0, or 1 with A1 → **indifferent**

The contract makes me completely indifferent between A0 and A1 regardless of what the opponent does! The same is true for Player 1 by symmetry.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

**Without contract**: 
- Dominant strategy equilibrium (A1, A1) → I get **1 point**

**With contract**:
- All strategy combinations are Nash equilibria
- (A0, A0) gives (2, 2) - **2 points for me**
- (A1, A1) gives (1, 1) - 1 point for me
- Even with random mixing 50/50: Expected payoff = 0.25(2+1+2+1) = **1.5 points**

## Step 5: Decision

The contract:
- Creates indifference that removes the incentive to defect
- Enables (A0, A0) as a focal equilibrium with payoff 2 > 1
- Cannot make me worse off (worst case is still 1)
- Likely improves my payoff through coordination on the Pareto-superior outcome

**I should sign the contract.**

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

The game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0        | A1        |
|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**                             | (2, 2)    | (0, 3)    |
| **A1**                             | (3, 0)    | (1, 1)    |

This is a variant of the "Battle of the Sexes" or coordination game with asymmetric payoffs. But importantly, it's **not symmetric** in payoffs.

But note: we are Player 2 — that means in the payoff matrix above, **you** are the second player.

So, if we write the payoffs from **your** perspective as Player 2:

- (A0, A0): you get 2  
- (A0, A1): you get 3  
- (A1, A0): you get 0  
- (A1, A1): you get 1  

Wait — need to recheck:  
In the description:
- You choose A0, other chooses A0 → you get 2 → correct  
- You choose A0, other chooses A1 → you get 0 → correct  
- You choose A1, other chooses A0 → you get 3 → correct  
- You choose A1, other chooses A1 → you get 1 → correct  

So the payoff matrix from **your** perspective is:

| Your Action \ Opponent | A0 | A1 |
|------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                 | 2  | 0  |
| **A1**                 | 3  | 1  |

From the opponent’s perspective:
| Opponent \ Your Action | A0 | A1 |
|------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                 | 2  | 3  |
| **A1**                 | 0  | 1  |

So both players have an incentive to coordinate on A0, but if you go A1, you get a higher payoff *only if the opponent plays A0*. But if the opponent plays A1, you get only 1, which is better than 0 if you played A0.

But the key is: **you are Player 2**, and you are trying to maximize **your** total points.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Contract**

The contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0 → **no additional payment**
- If a player chooses A1 → they pay **2 points**, distributed **equally among the other players**

Important: **The contract is only active if both players sign it.**

Since you are Player 2, and the contract was proposed by Player 1, you have to decide whether to sign.

- If **you sign**, then when you play A1, you lose 2 points (and the other player gains 1 point).
- If **you don’t sign**, the contract does nothing.

But also: **if you sign, you must assume Player 1 will sign too**, otherwise contract is inactive.

So the contract only applies **if both players sign**, and in that case:
- Whenever a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points → 1 point goes to the other player.
→ So the effect is:
  - For **you**, if you play A1 and the other plays A0 → you originally get 3, but now you pay 2 → you get 1, and opponent gets 1 extra (they gain 1)
  - But wait — the payment is **from** you to the other player. So your net payoff is reduced by 2 when you play A1.

Let’s formalize.

---

### **Step 3: Effect of the Contract on Payoffs**

Assume **both players sign the contract**.

Then, when a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points, distributed to the other player (1 point each? But only 1 other player — so 2 points to other player).

> "distributed equally among the other players" — only one other player.

So: **if you play A1, you pay 2 points to the other player**.

Thus:

Your total payoff = original payoff + **-2** if you play A1 (because you pay 2 to the other player)

Note: The penalty is **only when you play A1**. If you play A0, no cost.

So the **contract changes your payoffs** as follows:

| Your Action \ Opponent | A0              | A1              |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **A0**                 | 2               | 0               |
| **A1**                 | 3 - 2 = 1       | 1 - 2 = -1      |

Why? Because when you play A1, you lose 2 points (payment), regardless of the other player's action.

So your new payoff table under contract:

- (A0, A0): 2
- (A0, A1): 0
- (A1, A0): 1
- (A1, A1): -1

Now, compare this to the original.

---

### **Step 4: What would you do under the contract?**

You are choosing the best response to the opponent’s strategy — but since both players act simultaneously, you consider Nash equilibrium or optimal mixed strategy.

But more simply: **Will signing this contract help you achieve a better expected payoff?**

Let’s compare:

- **Without contract**: You can play pure A1 if you believe opponent plays A0, or A0 if you believe opponent plays A1.
But we need to find the best strategy given uncertainty.

Wait — perhaps we should compute the **expected payoff** under optimal play **with and without the contract**, and see whether signing gives you more.

But the contract is **only binding if both sign**, so we have to assume that **if you sign, the other player may or may not sign** — but the contract only takes effect if both sign.

So the critical point is: **Player 1 (the proposer)** will only sign if they think it benefits them.

But you cannot control that — you are deciding only whether to sign, based on whether you expect the contract to be active and beneficial.

But the twist says: "the contract was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1)" — so it may be that **Player 1 has already decided to sign**, and now you are deciding.

But the problem says: **"you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract"** — and **"the contract becomes active only if all players sign it"**.

So, to make the contract active, **both must sign**.

So your decision depends on whether you think **signing will improve your expected payoff IF the other player also signs**.

But you don't know if they will sign — but **Player 1 proposed it**, so probably they want it to pass — so likely they will sign if you do.

But you can assume that **if you sign, and Player 1 is rational, they will also sign** — but we need to check if the contract benefits them too.

Alternatively, we can take a more direct approach: **should you sign the contract, assuming it will become active (i.e., both sign)?**

So, we assume: **contract is active** if you sign → we analyze whether you benefit.

So, under contract, your payoffs are:

- (A0, A0): 2
- (A0, A1): 0
- (A1, A0): 1
- (A1, A1): -1

Now, what is your optimal play under this new payoff structure?

Let’s find the best response.

Let p = probability you play A0, so 1-p plays A1.

Let q = probability the opponent plays A0.

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 2q + 0(1-q) = 2q
- If you play A1: 1q + (-1)(1-q) = q - 1 + q = 2q - 1

You prefer A0 if 2q > 2q - 1 → always true?  
2q > 2q - 1 ⇒ 0 > -1 ⇒ always true.

So **A0 is strictly better than A1 for any q**.

Thus, in the contract setting, no matter what the opponent does, **you always prefer A0**.

So your best strategy under contract is to play A0 with probability 1.

Now, what is your expected payoff? Dependent on opponent’s action.

But since you are maximizing **your** payoff, and under contract, you’ll play A0 for sure.

Then your payoff:
- If opponent plays A0 → you get 2
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 0

So your expected payoff is 2q, where q is opponent's probability of A0.

But now: what does the opponent do under the contract?

We must consider the **opponent’s incentives**.

---

### **Step 5: Opponent’s Incentives under the Contract**

Player 1 (the opponent) also faces the same contract rules.

So for them:
- If they play A1 → they pay 2 points to you (you get +2)
- If they play A0 → no payment

So their payoff matrix (from their perspective):

| Their Action \ Your Action | A0         | A1          |
|----------------------------|------------|-------------|
| **A0**                     | 2          | 3           |
| **A1**                     | 0 + 2 = 2  | 1 + 2 = 3   |

Wait — let’s be precise.

Their original payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 2
- (A0, A1): 3
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A1, A1): 1

Now, under the contract, if they play A1, they **pay 2 points to you**, so:
- (A1, A0): 0 - 2 = -2 (they lose 2)
- (A1, A1): 1 - 2 = -1

So their new payoff matrix:

| Opponent \ Your Action | A0           | A1           |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**                 | 2            | 3            |
| **A1**                 | -2           | -1           |

Now, what is their best response?

Let p = probability you play A0.

Their expected payoff:
- A0: 2p + 3(1-p) = 2p + 3 - 3p = 3 - p
- A1: (-2)p + (-1)(1-p) = -2p -1 + p = -p -1

Compare:
- A0 better if 3 - p > -p - 1 ⇒ 3 > -1 → always true.

So **A0 is strictly better than A1** for the opponent for any p.

Thus, the opponent will also play A0 with probability 1.

So under the contract, both players will play A0 → outcome is (A0, A0) → payoffs:

- You get 2 (original) + (you didn’t play A1 → no cost) = 2
- Opponent gets 2

So **your final payoff is 2** under the contract, assuming both sign.

---

### **Step 6: What happens without the contract?**

Now, consider the case where **you do not sign the contract**.

Then the contract is inactive — so the original payoffs apply.

Your payoff matrix (you are Player 2):

| Your Action \ Opponent | A0 | A1 |
|------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                 | 2  | 0  |
| **A1**                 | 3  | 1  |

Now, find best response.

Let q = opponent's probability of A0.

Your expected payoff:
- A0: 2q + 0(1-q) = 2q
- A1: 3q + 1(1-q) = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1

Now compare:
- A1 better if 2q + 1 > 2q → 1 > 0 → always true!

So **A1 strictly dominates A0** for you in the original game.

Thus, you will always play A1.

Now, what does the opponent do?

Their payoff matrix (Player 1):

| Their Action \ Your Action | A0  | A1  |
|----------------------------|-----|-----|
| **A0**                     | 2   | 3   |
| **A1**                     | 0   | 1   |

Let p = your probability of A0 (we just said p = 0, since you play A1 for sure).

So q = probability opponent plays A0.

Their payoff:
- A0: 2(0) + 3(1) = 3
- A1: 0(0) + 1(1) = 1

So A0 is better.

So opponent plays A0 for sure.

Thus, outcome: you play A1, opponent plays A0.

Your payoff: 3 (from original payoff)

**So without contract → you get 3 points**

With contract → you get 2 points

So **you are worse off under the contract**.

Even though the contract forces both to play A0 (you get 2), without it you can play A1 and get 3 (by inducing opponent to play A0 — which they do, since it's better for them).

So your expected payoff without contract is 3.

With contract, it's 2.

Thus, **you should not sign**.

---

### **Step 7: Final Answer**

Even though the contract makes you play A0 and avoids the worst outcomes, it prevents you from playing A1 and getting 3 points when the opponent plays A0 — which is their best response.

And since the contract is only active if both sign, and if you sign, the opponent will also sign (as it makes *them* prefer A0 too), then the outcome is (A0, A0), giving you only 2.

But without the contract, you can get 3.

So signing **reduces your payoff**.

Therefore, you should **not sign**.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Understand the base game without contract

The payoff matrix for me (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 2
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 1

Without the contract, this is a Prisoner's Dilemma:
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A1 (3 > 2)
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A1 (1 > 0)

**Result:** Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), giving both players 1 point each.

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds: "If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points to the other player."

New payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 2 + 0 = **2** (no payments)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 = **2** (I receive 2 from opponent's A1 penalty)
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 = **1** (I pay 2 for choosing A1)
- (A1, A1): 1 - 2 + 2 = **1** (I pay 2, but receive 2 from opponent)

New payoff matrix with contract:
```
              Opponent A0    Opponent A1
My A0              2              2
My A1              1              1
```

## Step 3: Analyze the contract's effect

With the contract:
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A0 (2 > 1)
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A0 (2 > 1)

**A0 now strictly dominates A1!**

The Nash equilibrium becomes (A0, A0), giving both players 2 points each.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** Expected payoff = 1 point (from A1, A1 equilibrium)
- **With contract:** Expected payoff = 2 points (from A0, A0 equilibrium)

The contract transforms the game from a Prisoner's Dilemma into one where cooperation is the dominant strategy!

## Step 5: Decision

Since the opponent faces identical incentives, they should also sign. By signing, I:
- Get 2 points if opponent signs (contract active)
- Get 1 point if opponent doesn't sign (contract inactive, same as not signing)

Signing weakly dominates not signing.

response:
Let's analyze this problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the game structure (without the contract)

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two players, and each chooses between two actions: A0 or A1.

Payoffs (as given, for **Player 2**, since you are Player 2):

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Points | Opponent's Points |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 2           | 2                 |
| A0          | A1                | 0           | 3                 |
| A1          | A0                | 3           | 0                 |
| A1          | A1                | 1           | 1                 |

So, from **Player 2's perspective**, the payoff matrix is:

|          | A0 (Opponent) | A1 (Opponent) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **A0**   | 2              | 0              |
| **A1**   | 3              | 1              |

This is a classic **coordination game with asymmetry**, but let's check for Nash equilibria.

---

### Step 2: Compute best responses

Let’s suppose Player 1 chooses A0 with probability `p`, and A1 with probability `(1 - p)`.

We want to find Player 2’s best response.

Player 2’s expected payoff:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Expected payoff = `p * 2 + (1 - p) * 0 = 2p`

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Expected payoff = `p * 3 + (1 - p) * 1 = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1`

Now compare:
- A0: `2p`
- A1: `2p + 1`

Since `2p + 1 > 2p` for all `p`, **A1 always gives a higher payoff than A0**, regardless of `p`.

So **Player 2's best response is to always play A1**, no matter what Player 1 does.

Wait—let’s double-check this.

Yes:
- Difference = `(2p + 1) - 2p = 1`
- So A1 is always **1 point better** than A0, regardless of opponent’s mix.

Therefore, **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2**.

So, **in the game without any contract adjustments**, Player 2 should play A1 with 100% probability.

---

### Step 3: Consider the contract — but it's rejected

The twist is that a contract was proposed (by Player 1), and **Player 2 rejected it**.

The contract says:
- If you play A1, you pay 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

But since **Player 2 rejected it**, **the contract is NOT active**.

Therefore, the original payoffs apply.

So even though the contract would have penalized A1 plays by 2 points (to be distributed to others), **we don't have to worry about it**, because it’s off.

So the original payoff matrix stands.

---

### Step 4: Conclusion

Since:
- A1 strictly dominates A0
- No contract penalty applies
- You are Player 2

The optimal strategy for you is to play **A1 with 100% probability**.

This maximizes your expected payoff regardless of what Player 1 does.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

This is a 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1. Payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Payoff | Other Player's Payoff |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 2           | 2                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 1           | 1                      |

This is a variant of a coordination game with an incentive to mismatch (since choosing A1 when the other chooses A0 gives you 3, which is better than 2).

We can analyze the Nash equilibria.

#### Best Responses:
- If you think the other player plays A0:
  - You get 2 for choosing A0, 3 for choosing A1 → so you prefer A1.
- If you think the other player plays A1:
  - You get 0 for choosing A0, 1 for choosing A1 → so you prefer A1.

So **A1 is a dominant strategy** for you in the base game — regardless of what the other player does, you get more by choosing A1.

Similarly, for the other player:
- If you play A0 → they get 2 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefer A0
- If you play A1 → they get 3 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0

Wait — so **for the other player, A0 is dominant**.

So the base game has a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium: **You play A1, Other plays A0** → you get 3, they get 0.

But wait: this is asymmetric in incentives. You prefer A1, they prefer A0.

So in the equilibrium, you choose A1, they choose A0 → you get 3, they get 0.

But we need to consider if they might deviate, or if this is stable.

But in equilibrium, no one wants to deviate:
- You are already doing best response: A1 vs A0 → payoff 3
- They are doing best response: A0 vs A1 → payoff 2? Wait, no: they get 0 if you play A1.

Wait — let's clarify:

If **you** play A1, and they play A0, then:
- You get 3
- They get 0

Now, if they deviate to A1, they get 1. So they prefer to stay with A0.

If they play A1, you get 0, but you prefer A1 → you get 1 (if they play A1), which is better than 0, so you'd stick with A1.

So yes, (A1, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

But is there another?

What about (A0, A0)? You get 2, they get 2. You want to deviate to A1 (get 3), so not equilibrium.

What about (A1, A1)? You get 1, they get 1. But if you deviate to A0, and they stay on A1, you get 0 — worse. So you wouldn’t deviate. But they — if they deviate to A0, and you stay on A1, they get 0 — but they get 1 in A1? Wait: no:

If both play A1 → you get 1, they get 1.

If they deviate to A0 (you still on A1), they get 0 — worse. So they wouldn’t deviate.

But you — if you deviate to A0, you get 0 (since other plays A1) → worse than 1. So you wouldn’t deviate.

So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium? Wait:

- You at A1, other at A1 → you get 1
- If you deviate to A0: you get 0 → worse → so stay
- Other at A1, you at A1 → they get 1
- If they deviate to A0: they get 0 → worse → so stay

Yes, so (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

Now (A0, A0): you get 2, other gets 2
- You deviate to A1 → get 3 → better → so not equilibrium
- Other deviates to A1 → get 3 → better → so not equilibrium

(A0, A1): you get 0, other gets 3
- You deviate to A1 → get 1 → better → not equilibrium
- Other: if they deviate to A0, they get 2 → worse than 3 → so they don’t want to deviate, but you do → not equilibrium

So **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**:
1. (A1, A0) → you get 3, other gets 0
2. (A1, A1) → you get 1, other gets 1

Also mixed strategy equilibria possible, but let’s see: the players have conflicting interests — this is a "battle of the sexes" style game with asymmetry.

But note: in (A1, A0), you get 3 (best for you), other gets 0 (worst for them). In (A1, A1), you get 1, they get 1 (both get moderate).

So you prefer (A1, A0); they prefer (A0, A0) or (A1, A1)? Let’s see.

If you play A1, they prefer A0 → get 0, but if they play A1, they get 1 → so they prefer A1 if you play A1.

So they prefer (A1, A1) over (A1, A0): 1 > 0.

You prefer (A1, A0) over (A1, A1): 3 > 1.

So conflict in preferences.

### **Step 2: Introduce the Contract**

The contract says:

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+1** point, **drawn equally from the other players**
- If a player chooses A1, they **pay an additional -1** point, **distributed equally to the other players**

Important: "drawn equally from the other players" — this means that if there are 2 players, then:
- If you choose A0 → you get +1, and the other player loses 1
- If you choose A1 → you pay -1 (i.e., lose 1), and the other player gains 1

So the **net effect** on payoffs is:
- For choosing A0:
  - You gain 1
  - Other player loses 1
- For choosing A1:
  - You lose 1
  - Other player gains 1

This is a **transfer**: playing A0 subsidizes you and penalizes the other; playing A1 penalizes you and benefits the other.

So the **contract changes the payoffs**.

Let’s write the **new payoff matrix** (Player 1 = you, Player 2 = other).

We must add the **contract terms** to the base payoffs.

#### New Payoffs (with contract):

| P1 A | P2 A | Base P1 | Base P2 | Contract: P1 A0 → P1+1, P2-1 | Contract: P2 A0 → P2+1, P1-1 | Total P1 | Total P2 |
|------|------|---------|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| A0   | A0   | 2       | 2       | +1 (P1 A0)                    | +1 (P2 A0)                    | 2+1-1=2  | 2+1-1=2  |
| A0   | A1   | 0       | 3       | +1 (P1 A0)                    | -1 (P2 A1)                    | 0+1+1=2  | 3-1-1=1  |
| A1   | A0   | 3       | 0       | -1 (P1 A1)                    | +1 (P2 A0)                    | 3-1-1=1  | 0+1+1=2  |
| A1   | A1   | 1       | 1       | -1 (P1 A1)                    | -1 (P2 A1)                    | 1-1-1=-1 | 1-1-1=-1 |

Wait — let’s go step by step.

The contract terms:
- **If a player chooses A0**, they get +1 (from the contract)
- **If a player chooses A1**, they pay -1 (so lose 1)

And the **+1 or -1 is taken from or paid to the other player**, equally — but since only two players, the entire amount goes to/from the other player.

So **each player** gets:
- +1 if they choose A0
- -1 if they choose A1
- **No matter what the other player does**

So the contract adds a term that depends only on **your own** action.

Therefore, the **total payoff** for each player is:
> Base payoff + [1 if you play A0, -1 if you play A1]

Let’s recompute the total payoffs.

### **New Total Payoffs (contract active)**

| P1 A | P2 A | Base P1 | Base P2 | Contract P1 | Contract P2 | Total P1 | Total P2 |
|------|------|---------|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| A0   | A0   | 2       | 2       | +1          | +1          | 3        | 3        |
| A0   | A1   | 0       | 3       | +1          | -1          | 1        | 2        |
| A1   | A0   | 3       | 0       | -1          | +1          | 2        | 1        |
| A1   | A1   | 1       | 1       | -1          | -1          | 0        | 0        |

Now let's analyze this new game.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the New Game (with Contract)**

Payoff matrix (Player 1 = you):

|        | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| P1 A0  | 3     | 1     |
| P1 A1  | 2     | 0     |

Now, let's find best responses.

For Player 1 (you):
- If P2 plays A0: you get 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1: you get 1 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is a dominant strategy for you**.

For Player 2 (other):
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 3 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is dominant for Player 2 too**.

Thus, **(A0, A0) is the unique Nash equilibrium** under the contract, and it is **strongly dominant for both players**.

Final payoffs: both get 3.

---

### **Step 4: Compare Payoffs — With vs Without Contract**

#### Without contract:
- You can achieve **3** in the (A1, A0) equilibrium, but only if the other player cooperates by playing A0.
- But the other player has no incentive to play A0 — because if you play A1, they get 0, but if they play A1, they get 1 → so they prefer A1.
- So the equilibrium is either:
  - (A1, A1): both get 1 → your payoff: 1
  - Or (A1, A0): your payoff: 3, but they don’t want to play it — so unless you can commit, it's not credible.

But in a simultaneous-move game without communication, players are more likely to play (A1, A1), or perhaps use mixed strategies.

Let’s compute **expected payoff under mixed strategies**, but even better: what is the **best you can guarantee**?

But let’s suppose that players are rational and try to maximize their payoffs.

In the base game, if you play A1, you get 3 if the other plays A0, 1 if they play A1.

So your expected payoff depends on their strategy.

But if the other player is rational, they will not play A0 if you play A1 — because A1 gives them 1 > 0.

So the only equilibrium you can reasonably expect is (A1, A1) → you get 1.

Alternative: mixed strategies.

Let’s compute the mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let p = probability P2 plays A0. You choose between A0 and A1.

You want to make P2 indifferent.

Your payoff:
- A0: 2p + 0(1-p) = 2p
- A1: 3p + 1(1-p) = 3p + 1 - p = 2p + 1

Set equal: 2p = 2p + 1 → 0 = 1 → impossible.

So you always prefer A1 — your payoff from A1 is always higher: 2p + 1 > 2p.

So **A1 is strictly dominant for you**.

Similarly, for P2:
- A0: 2q + 3(1-q) = 2q + 3 - 3q = 3 - q
- A1: 0q + 1(1-q) = 1 - q

Set equal: 3 - q = 1 - q → 3 = 1 → impossible.

So A0 is always better for P2: 3 - q > 1 - q.

So dominant strategy equilibrium: (A1, A0) → you get 3, they get 0.

But this is only if **P2 plays A0** — but P2 won’t play A0 if you play A1 — because they get 0, but if they play A1, they get 1.

So P2’s best response to your A1 is A1.

So **rational play leads to (A1, A1)** → both get 1.

But wait — P2’s best response to your A1 is A1 → gets 1
- If they played A0 → gets 0 → worse
- So they prefer A1

And you, best response to their A1: A1 gives you 1, A0 gives you 0 → so you prefer A1

So (A1, A1) is the **only Nash equilibrium** that survives iterative elimination of dominated strategies.

(A1, A0) is not stable because P2 wants to deviate.

So in the base game, the only stable outcome is (A1, A1) → you get **1 point**.

Even though (A1, A0) gives you 3, it’s not rational for P2 to play A0 if you play A1.

So **without contract**, your guaranteed payoff (in equilibrium) is **1**.

---

### **With Contract**

As shown, contract leads to **(A0, A0)** as the unique dominant strategy equilibrium.

Both players play A0.

You get **3 points**.

That’s significantly better than 1.

---

### **But Wait: The Contract Requires Agreement**

The contract only becomes active if **both players agree to sign**.

So you must decide: **Should you sign?**

If you sign:

- The contract applies only if **both** sign → so if you sign but they don’t, the contract is **not active**
- If you don’t sign, contract is inactive regardless

But the contract was **proposed by Player 2**, and approved via voting — so it’s likely that **Player 2 wants to sign**, and possibly will.

But we don’t know for sure.

But you must decide: should you sign?

Key point: if you sign, and the other signs, then you both get **3**.

If you sign but the other doesn’t, the contract is inactive → game is base game → you get **1** (in equilibrium)

So if you sign, you get:
- 3 if they sign (expected if they are rational and want to improve)
- 1 if they don’t sign

But if you **don’t sign**, then contract is inactive regardless → you get 1 (base game equilibrium)

So your **expected payoff depends on whether you believe the other player will sign**.

But the contract was **proposed by Player 2**, and approved via voting — so if Player 2 approved it, then **they are willing to sign**, and likely to sign if you do.

Moreover, **if you sign**, and they sign, you get 3.

If you don’t sign, you get only 1.

So unless you expect them to **not sign**, it’s better to sign.

Now: will they sign?

Player 2’s payoff:

In base game, if they play A0, they get 2 if you play A0, and 0 if you play A1.

But they prefer A0 — but in equilibrium, they play A1 and you play A1 → they get 1.

But under contract, if the contract is active, and both play A0 → they get 3.

And since A0 is dominant for them under contract, they will play A0.

So **they prefer the contract** — they get 3 instead of 1.

So it’s in **their interest to sign**.

Thus, **if you sign, they will sign** — otherwise they miss out.

So **signing leads to (A0, A0), payoff 3**.

Not signing leads to (A1, A1), payoff 1.

Thus, signing is **strictly better**.

### **Final Decision**

You should sign the contract.

✅ Sign.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
In this game, the objective is to maximize the total points received by considering both the basic game rules and the additional payment contract.

Let's analyze the payoff matrix first:

Without Considering the Contract:
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 2 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 1 point.

Adding the Contract Effects:
- If Player 2 chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point.
- If Player 2 chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point.

This modifies the payoffs as follows:
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2's payoff becomes 2 + 1 (contract) = 3 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2's payoff becomes 0 + 1 (contract) = 1 point.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2's payoff becomes 3 - 1 (contract) = 2 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2's payoff becomes 1 - 1 (contract) = 0 points.

From Player 2's perspective considering the modified payoffs:
- The highest payoff occurs when Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 also chooses A0, resulting in 3 points.
- The second highest payoff occurs when Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0, resulting in 2 points.
- The third highest payoff occurs when Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1, resulting in 1 point.
- The lowest payoff occurs when Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1, resulting in 0 points.

Given these insights, Player 2 should adjust their probability distribution to maximize their expected payoff. Player 2's best strategy appears to heavily favor choosing A0 due to the consistently higher payoffs.

Therefore, the optimal choice for Player 2 that maximizes total points is to allocate a higher probability to A0 and some probability to A1 to cover potential mixed responses from Player 1:

```json
{"A0": 80, "A1": 20}
```

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game without the contract

The game is a symmetric two-player game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|            | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (2,2)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1** | (3,0)  | (1,1)  |

This is a classic coordination game with a mixed Nash equilibrium. Let's analyze the incentives.

---

### Step 2: Find the Nash equilibrium of the base game

We are Player 1. Let’s suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability q, and A1 with probability (1−q).

Player 1’s expected payoff for choosing A0:
- E[A0] = q×2 + (1−q)×0 = 2q

Player 1’s expected payoff for choosing A1:
- E[A1] = q×3 + (1−q)×1 = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1

Set E[A0] = E[A1] to find the indifference point:
2q = 2q + 1 → 0 = 1 → contradiction.

So no q makes Player 1 indifferent — this suggests that **Player 1 always prefers A1** unless something is wrong.

Wait: 2q vs 2q + 1 → E[A1] > E[A0] for *all* q.

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 1**?

Wait — check:

If q = 0 (P2 always plays A1):
- A0 gives 0, A1 gives 1 → A1 better
If q = 1 (P2 always plays A0):
- A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 → A1 still better

So **A1 dominates A0 for Player 1**, regardless of Player 2's choice.

Now check for Player 2:

If P1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)

P2’s E[A0] = p×2 + (1−p)×0 = 2p  
P2’s E[A1] = p×3 + (1−p)×1 = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1

Again, E[A1] > E[A0] for all p.

So **A1 dominates A0 for Player 2 too**.

Therefore, the only pure Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoffs (1,1).

But wait — is that the only equilibrium?

Yes — since A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players, the only undominated strategy profile is (A1,A1).

Thus, in the base game, both players would choose A1, and both get 1 point.

---

### Step 3: Now consider the contract

The contract says:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 1 point**, drawn equally from the other player(s).
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

Note: since there are two players, "drawn equally from the other players" means: the 1 additional point to the player choosing A0 is taken from the other player (i.e., the other player loses 1 point).

So the **contract modifies the payoffs** as follows:

When a player chooses A0 → they gain +1, the other player loses 1.

When a player chooses A1 → no change.

So the **new payoff matrix** becomes:

|            | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0** | (2+1, 2−1) = (3,1) | (0+1, 3−1) = (1,2) |
| **P1: A1** | (3−1, 0+1) = (2,1) | (1,1)          |

Wait — clarify the contract: "received an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- If Player 1 chooses A0, they get +1, and Player 2 loses 1.
- If Player 2 chooses A0, they get +1, and Player 1 loses 1.

So for any action A0 by a player, the player gains 1, the other loses 1.

Thus, new payoffs:

**Case: P1:A0, P2:A0**
- P1 gets: 2 (base) + 1 (contract) = 3
- P2 gets: 2 (base) - 1 (contract) = 1

**Case: P1:A0, P2:A1**
- P1 gets: 0 (base) + 1 = 1
- P2 gets: 3 (base) - 1 = 2

**Case: P1:A1, P2:A0**
- P1 gets: 3 (base) - 1 = 2
- P2 gets: 0 (base) + 1 = 1

**Case: P1:A1, P2:A1**
- P1 gets: 1 (base) + 0 = 1
- P2 gets: 1 (base) + 0 = 1

So the new payoff matrix (P1, P2):

|            | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (3,1)  | (1,2)  |
| **P1: A1** | (2,1)  | (1,1)  |

---

### Step 4: Analyze the game under the contract

Now, we compute Nash equilibria under the contract.

Let’s find best responses.

**Player 1's best responses:**

- If P2 plays A0 (q=1):
  - P1: A0 → 3, A1 → 2 → better to play A0

- If P2 plays A1 (q=0):
  - P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent

So for P2 playing A1, P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now, suppose P2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q)

E[A0] = q×3 + (1−q)×1 = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1  
E[A1] = q×2 + (1−q)×1 = 2q + 1 − q = q + 1

Compare:  
2q + 1 vs q + 1 → 2q + 1 > q + 1 → q > 0

So:
- If q > 0 → A0 better
- If q = 0 → both give 1 → indifferent

So P1’s best response:
- Play A0 if q > 0
- Indifferent if q = 0

Now Player 2’s best responses:

If P1 plays A0 with p, A1 with (1−p)

E[A0] for P2 = p×1 + (1−p)×1 = 1  
E[A1] for P2 = p×2 + (1−p)×1 = 2p + 1 − p = p + 1

Compare:
- p + 1 vs 1 → p + 1 > 1 → p > 0

So:
- If p > 0 → A1 better
- If p = 0 → both give 1 → indifferent

So P2’s best response:
- Play A1 if p > 0
- Indifferent if p = 0

Now find Nash equilibria.

Try (A0, A0): q=1, p=1
- P1: A0 gives 3, A1 gives 2 → A0 best
- P2: A0 gives 1, A1 gives 2 → A1 better → not best response
→ not NE

Try (A0, A1): p=1, q=0
- P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent → A0 OK
- P2: A1 → 2, A0 → 1 → A1 best → OK
→ (A0, A1) is NE

Try (A1, A0): p=0, q=1
- P1: A0 → 3, A1 → 2 → A0 better → not best
→ not NE

Try (A1, A1): p=0, q=0
- P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent → A1 OK
- P2: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent → A1 OK
→ (A1, A1) is NE

Also, when p=0, q=0: both are indifferent → (A1, A1) is NE.

Now, are there other mixed equilibria?

We can look for a mixed equilibrium where both mix.

But note: the only way for P1 to be indifferent is if q = 0 (from earlier: E[A0] = 2q + 1, E[A1] = q + 1 → equal when 2q+1 = q+1 → q=0)

Similarly, for P2 to be indifferent: p + 1 = 1 → p = 0

So the only way both are indifferent is when p=0 and q=0 — which gives (A1,A1)

So the only Nash equilibria are:
1. (A0, A1) — P1: A0, P2: A1
2. (A1, A1) — both choose A1

Now examine the payoffs:
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 2
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 1

So in both cases, P1 gets 1 point.

But wait — in (A0, A1), P1 gets 1.

But is (A0, A1) stable? Yes, because:
- P1: if P2 plays A1, then P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1, so A0 is acceptable.
- P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A1 (2 > 1)

So it’s a NE.

But now — could P1 get more?

Suppose P1’s goal is to **maximize their own payoff**, and we’re in a one-shot game.

But we must consider: **If the contract is signed, it becomes active only if both players sign it.**

So we are deciding whether to **sign** the contract.

Currently, **Player 1 proposed the contract**, and it requires **approval voting** — meaning both players must agree for it to be active.

So if **I (Player 1)** don’t sign, the contract doesn’t activate.

If I sign, but the other player doesn’t, the contract doesn’t activate.

So my decision to sign is meaningless unless **both** sign.

But the question is: **should I sign the contract?**

We must decide: does signing help me get a higher expected payoff?

But **we don’t know what the other player will do**.

We must assume rational play.

Let’s consider both scenarios:

---

### Scenario 1: Contract is **not** signed (default game)

As established, A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players → (A1, A1) is the unique NE → both choose A1, get 1 point each.

So my payoff: **1**

---

### Scenario 2: Contract **is** signed

Now the game becomes the modified one:
- Payoffs as above
- Nash equilibria: (A0, A1) and (A1, A1)

In both, **P1 gets 1 point**.

So **my payoff is 1 regardless**.

But wait — could I get more? Could there be a way to force an outcome where I get more?

In (A0, A1), I get 1.

In (A1, A1), I get 1.

But could I get higher than 1?

Let’s see: is there a possibility that both players are willing to coordinate on something else?

But no — (A0,A0) is not a NE: if P2 plays A0, P1 wants to play A0, but P2 does not want to play A0 (since A1 gives 2 > 1), so P2 will deviate.

Similarly, (A0,A0) is not stable.

So the only equilibria give P1 a payoff of 1.

Same as in the base game.

So **my payoff is 1 in both cases**.

But wait — is there a **risk** of getting less?

No — in both games, the worst I can get is 1.

But in the contract game, **is there a possibility that I could get more than 1?**

Let’s see:

- If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0 → I get 3 → better.
- But P2 has no incentive to play A0 — because if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 1 from A0, but 2 from A1 → so P2 will play A1.

So (A0,A0) is not stable.

Similarly, if I play A0, P2 will play A1 → I get 1.

If I play A1, P2 might play A1 or A0 → but if P2 plays A0, I get 2; if P2 plays A1, I get 1.

But P2’s incentive: if I play A1, P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1? No:

- If P1 plays A1, then P2 gets:
  - A0: 1
  - A1: 1
→ so P2 is indifferent.

So if P1 plays A1, P2 could play A0 or A1.

So if P2 plays A0 with some probability, then P1 gets more than 1 sometimes.

But can I exploit that?

Only if I can **induce** P2 to play A0.

But P2 will only play A0 if it gives same or better payoff.

But if P1 plays A1:
- P2 gets 1 for A0, 1 for A1 → indifferent.

So P2 might play A0.

But if P2 plays A0, then P1 gets 2 (from A1,A0 → (2,1))

But P2 might not play A0.

But now consider: **if the contract is signed, and I play A1**, then I get:
- If P2 plays A0: 2
- If P2 plays A1: 1

But P2 is indifferent — so P2 could choose A0.

So **if** P2 plays A0, I get 2.

But **if** P2 plays A1, I get 1.

So my expected payoff depends on P2’s behavior.

Similarly, if I play A0:
- If P2 plays A1: I get 1 (since (A0,A1) → (1,2))
- If P2 plays A0: I get 3 → but P2 won’t play A0 because P2 prefers A1.

So P2 will play A1 if I play A0 → I get 1.

So:
- If I play A0 → I get 1 (since P2 will respond with A1)
- If I play A1 → I could get 2 (if P2 plays A0) or 1 (if P2 plays A1)

But in equilibrium, we assume rational play.

Let’s reconsider the equilibria.

We have:
1. (A0, A1) → P1 gets 1
2. (A1, A1) → P1 gets 1
3. Is (A1, A0) an equilibrium? No: P1 would prefer A0 (3 > 2), so no.
4. Is (A0, A0)? No: P2 prefers A1 (2 > 1)

So the only equilibria are (A0,A1) and (A1,A1)

Now, **if I play A1**, and P2 is rational, they don't have a strict preference — they are indifferent.

So P2 could play A0, but only if they expect that I will play A1.

But if P2 believes P1 will play A1, then P2 is indifferent and could mix.

But then we need a mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let’s suppose P1 plays A1 with probability 1.

Then P2 gets 1 for A0, 1 for A1 → indifferent.

So P2 can play any mix.

Similarly, if P2 plays A0 with probability r, and A1 with 1−r.

Now, P1’s expected payoff from playing A0: r×3 + (1−r)×1 = 3r + 1 − r = 2r + 1  
From playing A1: r×2 + (1−r)×1 = 2r + 1 − r = r + 1

So P1 prefers A0 if 2r + 1 > r + 1 → r > 0

So if r > 0 (P2 plays A0 with positive probability), P1 wants to play A0.

But if P1 plays A0, then P2 should play A1 (since if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 2 from A1, 1 from A0)

So only if P2 plays A1, it’s consistent with P1 playing A1.

Thus, the only stable outcome is when P2 plays A1 → then P1 is indifferent (A0 gives 1, A1 gives 1) → so P1 can play A1.

So (A1, A1) is an equilibrium.

If P1 plays A0, then P2 plays A1 → (A0, A1) is an equilibrium.

But if P1 plays A1 and P2 is uncertain, P1 has incentive to deviate to A0 if P2 plays A0 with positive probability.

Therefore, the **only robust equilibrium** is (A1, A1), or possibly (A0, A1).

But in both, I get 1.

So no way to get more than 1 under the contract.

But **critical point**: in the *base game*, I also get 1.

So expected payoff under contract is still **1**.

But wait — **what if I sign the contract and then the other player signs?**

In that case, would

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game without the contract

The game is a symmetric two-player game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|            | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (2,2)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1** | (3,0)  | (1,1)  |

This is a classic coordination game with a mixed Nash equilibrium. Let's analyze the incentives.

---

### Step 2: Find the Nash equilibrium of the base game

We are Player 1. Let’s suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability q, and A1 with probability (1−q).

Player 1’s expected payoff for choosing A0:
- E[A0] = q×2 + (1−q)×0 = 2q

Player 1’s expected payoff for choosing A1:
- E[A1] = q×3 + (1−q)×1 = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1

Set E[A0] = E[A1] to find the indifference point:
2q = 2q + 1 → 0 = 1 → contradiction.

So no q makes Player 1 indifferent — this suggests that **Player 1 always prefers A1** unless something is wrong.

Wait: 2q vs 2q + 1 → E[A1] > E[A0] for *all* q.

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 1**?

Wait — check:

If q = 0 (P2 always plays A1):
- A0 gives 0, A1 gives 1 → A1 better
If q = 1 (P2 always plays A0):
- A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 → A1 still better

So **A1 dominates A0 for Player 1**, regardless of Player 2's choice.

Now check for Player 2:

If P1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)

P2’s E[A0] = p×2 + (1−p)×0 = 2p  
P2’s E[A1] = p×3 + (1−p)×1 = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1

Again, E[A1] > E[A0] for all p.

So **A1 dominates A0 for Player 2 too**.

Therefore, the only pure Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoffs (1,1).

But wait — is that the only equilibrium?

Yes — since A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players, the only undominated strategy profile is (A1,A1).

Thus, in the base game, both players would choose A1, and both get 1 point.

---

### Step 3: Now consider the contract

The contract says:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 1 point**, drawn equally from the other player(s).
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

Note: since there are two players, "drawn equally from the other players" means: the 1 additional point to the player choosing A0 is taken from the other player (i.e., the other player loses 1 point).

So the **contract modifies the payoffs** as follows:

When a player chooses A0 → they gain +1, the other player loses 1.

When a player chooses A1 → no change.

So the **new payoff matrix** becomes:

|            | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0** | (2+1, 2−1) = (3,1) | (0+1, 3−1) = (1,2) |
| **P1: A1** | (3−1, 0+1) = (2,1) | (1,1)          |

Wait — clarify the contract: "received an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- If Player 1 chooses A0, they get +1, and Player 2 loses 1.
- If Player 2 chooses A0, they get +1, and Player 1 loses 1.

So for any action A0 by a player, the player gains 1, the other loses 1.

Thus, new payoffs:

**Case: P1:A0, P2:A0**
- P1 gets: 2 (base) + 1 (contract) = 3
- P2 gets: 2 (base) - 1 (contract) = 1

**Case: P1:A0, P2:A1**
- P1 gets: 0 (base) + 1 = 1
- P2 gets: 3 (base) - 1 = 2

**Case: P1:A1, P2:A0**
- P1 gets: 3 (base) - 1 = 2
- P2 gets: 0 (base) + 1 = 1

**Case: P1:A1, P2:A1**
- P1 gets: 1 (base) + 0 = 1
- P2 gets: 1 (base) + 0 = 1

So the new payoff matrix (P1, P2):

|            | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (3,1)  | (1,2)  |
| **P1: A1** | (2,1)  | (1,1)  |

---

### Step 4: Analyze the game under the contract

Now, we compute Nash equilibria under the contract.

Let’s find best responses.

**Player 1's best responses:**

- If P2 plays A0 (q=1):
  - P1: A0 → 3, A1 → 2 → better to play A0

- If P2 plays A1 (q=0):
  - P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent

So for P2 playing A1, P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now, suppose P2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q)

E[A0] = q×3 + (1−q)×1 = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1  
E[A1] = q×2 + (1−q)×1 = 2q + 1 − q = q + 1

Compare:  
2q + 1 vs q + 1 → 2q + 1 > q + 1 → q > 0

So:
- If q > 0 → A0 better
- If q = 0 → both give 1 → indifferent

So P1’s best response:
- Play A0 if q > 0
- Indifferent if q = 0

Now Player 2’s best responses:

If P1 plays A0 with p, A1 with (1−p)

E[A0] for P2 = p×1 + (1−p)×1 = 1  
E[A1] for P2 = p×2 + (1−p)×1 = 2p + 1 − p = p + 1

Compare:
- p + 1 vs 1 → p + 1 > 1 → p > 0

So:
- If p > 0 → A1 better
- If p = 0 → both give 1 → indifferent

So P2’s best response:
- Play A1 if p > 0
- Indifferent if p = 0

Now find Nash equilibria.

Try (A0, A0): q=1, p=1
- P1: A0 gives 3, A1 gives 2 → A0 best
- P2: A0 gives 1, A1 gives 2 → A1 better → not best response
→ not NE

Try (A0, A1): p=1, q=0
- P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent → A0 OK
- P2: A1 → 2, A0 → 1 → A1 best → OK
→ (A0, A1) is NE

Try (A1, A0): p=0, q=1
- P1: A0 → 3, A1 → 2 → A0 better → not best
→ not NE

Try (A1, A1): p=0, q=0
- P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent → A1 OK
- P2: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent → A1 OK
→ (A1, A1) is NE

Also, when p=0, q=0: both are indifferent → (A1, A1) is NE.

Now, are there other mixed equilibria?

We can look for a mixed equilibrium where both mix.

But note: the only way for P1 to be indifferent is if q = 0 (from earlier: E[A0] = 2q + 1, E[A1] = q + 1 → equal when 2q+1 = q+1 → q=0)

Similarly, for P2 to be indifferent: p + 1 = 1 → p = 0

So the only way both are indifferent is when p=0 and q=0 — which gives (A1,A1)

So the only Nash equilibria are:
1. (A0, A1) — P1: A0, P2: A1
2. (A1, A1) — both choose A1

Now examine the payoffs:
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 2
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 1

So in both cases, P1 gets 1 point.

But wait — in (A0, A1), P1 gets 1.

But is (A0, A1) stable? Yes, because:
- P1: if P2 plays A1, then P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1, so A0 is acceptable.
- P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A1 (2 > 1)

So it’s a NE.

But now — could P1 get more?

Suppose P1’s goal is to **maximize their own payoff**, and we’re in a one-shot game.

But we must consider: **If the contract is signed, it becomes active only if both players sign it.**

So we are deciding whether to **sign** the contract.

Currently, **Player 1 proposed the contract**, and it requires **approval voting** — meaning both players must agree for it to be active.

So if **I (Player 1)** don’t sign, the contract doesn’t activate.

If I sign, but the other player doesn’t, the contract doesn’t activate.

So my decision to sign is meaningless unless **both** sign.

But the question is: **should I sign the contract?**

We must decide: does signing help me get a higher expected payoff?

But **we don’t know what the other player will do**.

We must assume rational play.

Let’s consider both scenarios:

---

### Scenario 1: Contract is **not** signed (default game)

As established, A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players → (A1, A1) is the unique NE → both choose A1, get 1 point each.

So my payoff: **1**

---

### Scenario 2: Contract **is** signed

Now the game becomes the modified one:
- Payoffs as above
- Nash equilibria: (A0, A1) and (A1, A1)

In both, **P1 gets 1 point**.

So **my payoff is 1 regardless**.

But wait — could I get more? Could there be a way to force an outcome where I get more?

In (A0, A1), I get 1.

In (A1, A1), I get 1.

But could I get higher than 1?

Let’s see: is there a possibility that both players are willing to coordinate on something else?

But no — (A0,A0) is not a NE: if P2 plays A0, P1 wants to play A0, but P2 does not want to play A0 (since A1 gives 2 > 1), so P2 will deviate.

Similarly, (A0,A0) is not stable.

So the only equilibria give P1 a payoff of 1.

Same as in the base game.

So **my payoff is 1 in both cases**.

But wait — is there a **risk** of getting less?

No — in both games, the worst I can get is 1.

But in the contract game, **is there a possibility that I could get more than 1?**

Let’s see:

- If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0 → I get 3 → better.
- But P2 has no incentive to play A0 — because if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 1 from A0, but 2 from A1 → so P2 will play A1.

So (A0,A0) is not stable.

Similarly, if I play A0, P2 will play A1 → I get 1.

If I play A1, P2 might play A1 or A0 → but if P2 plays A0, I get 2; if P2 plays A1, I get 1.

But P2’s incentive: if I play A1, P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1? No:

- If P1 plays A1, then P2 gets:
  - A0: 1
  - A1: 1
→ so P2 is indifferent.

So if P1 plays A1, P2 could play A0 or A1.

So if P2 plays A0 with some probability, then P1 gets more than 1 sometimes.

But can I exploit that?

Only if I can **induce** P2 to play A0.

But P2 will only play A0 if it gives same or better payoff.

But if P1 plays A1:
- P2 gets 1 for A0, 1 for A1 → indifferent.

So P2 might play A0.

But if P2 plays A0, then P1 gets 2 (from A1,A0 → (2,1))

But P2 might not play A0.

But now consider: **if the contract is signed, and I play A1**, then I get:
- If P2 plays A0: 2
- If P2 plays A1: 1

But P2 is indifferent — so P2 could choose A0.

So **if** P2 plays A0, I get 2.

But **if** P2 plays A1, I get 1.

So my expected payoff depends on P2’s behavior.

Similarly, if I play A0:
- If P2 plays A1: I get 1 (since (A0,A1) → (1,2))
- If P2 plays A0: I get 3 → but P2 won’t play A0 because P2 prefers A1.

So P2 will play A1 if I play A0 → I get 1.

So:
- If I play A0 → I get 1 (since P2 will respond with A1)
- If I play A1 → I could get 2 (if P2 plays A0) or 1 (if P2 plays A1)

But in equilibrium, we assume rational play.

Let’s reconsider the equilibria.

We have:
1. (A0, A1) → P1 gets 1
2. (A1, A1) → P1 gets 1
3. Is (A1, A0) an equilibrium? No: P1 would prefer A0 (3 > 2), so no.
4. Is (A0, A0)? No: P2 prefers A1 (2 > 1)

So the only equilibria are (A0,A1) and (A1,A1)

Now, **if I play A1**, and P2 is rational, they don't have a strict preference — they are indifferent.

So P2 could play A0, but only if they expect that I will play A1.

But if P2 believes P1 will play A1, then P2 is indifferent and could mix.

But then we need a mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let’s suppose P1 plays A1 with probability 1.

Then P2 gets 1 for A0, 1 for A1 → indifferent.

So P2 can play any mix.

Similarly, if P2 plays A0 with probability r, and A1 with 1−r.

Now, P1’s expected payoff from playing A0: r×3 + (1−r)×1 = 3r + 1 − r = 2r + 1  
From playing A1: r×2 + (1−r)×1 = 2r + 1 − r = r + 1

So P1 prefers A0 if 2r + 1 > r + 1 → r > 0

So if r > 0 (P2 plays A0 with positive probability), P1 wants to play A0.

But if P1 plays A0, then P2 should play A1 (since if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 2 from A1, 1 from A0)

So only if P2 plays A1, it’s consistent with P1 playing A1.

Thus, the only stable outcome is when P2 plays A1 → then P1 is indifferent (A0 gives 1, A1 gives 1) → so P1 can play A1.

So (A1, A1) is an equilibrium.

If P1 plays A0, then P2 plays A1 → (A0, A1) is an equilibrium.

But if P1 plays A1 and P2 is uncertain, P1 has incentive to deviate to A0 if P2 plays A0 with positive probability.

Therefore, the **only robust equilibrium** is (A1, A1), or possibly (A0, A1).

But in both, I get 1.

So no way to get more than 1 under the contract.

But **critical point**: in the *base game*, I also get 1.

So expected payoff under contract is still **1**.

But wait — **what if I sign the contract and then the other player signs?**

In that case, would

Let’s suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability q, and A1 with probability (1−q).\n\nPlayer 1’s expected payoff for choosing A0:\n- E[A0] = q×2 + (1−q)×0 = 2q\n\nPlayer 1’s expected payoff for choosing A1:\n- E[A1] = q×3 + (1−q)×1 = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1\n\nSet E[A0] = E[A1] to find the indifference point:\n2q = 2q + 1 → 0 = 1 → contradiction.\n\nSo no q makes Player 1 indifferent — this suggests that **Player 1 always prefers A1** unless something is wrong.\n\nWait: 2q vs 2q + 1 → E[A1] > E[A0] for *all* q.\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 1**?\n\nWait — check:\n\nIf q = 0 (P2 always plays A1):\n- A0 gives 0, A1 gives 1 → A1 better\nIf q = 1 (P2 always plays A0):\n- A0 gives 2, A1 gives 3 → A1 still better\n\nSo **A1 dominates A0 for Player 1**, regardless of Player 2\'s choice.\n\nNow check for Player 2:\n\nIf P1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)\n\nP2’s E[A0] = p×2 + (1−p)×0 = 2p  \nP2’s E[A1] = p×3 + (1−p)×1 = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1\n\nAgain, E[A1] > E[A0] for all p.\n\nSo **A1 dominates A0 for Player 2 too**.\n\nTherefore, the only pure Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoffs (1,1).\n\nBut wait — is that the only equilibrium?\n\nYes — since A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players, the only undominated strategy profile is (A1,A1).\n\nThus, in the base game, both players would choose A1, and both get 1 point.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Now consider the contract\n\nThe contract says:\n- If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 1 point**, drawn equally from the other player(s).\n- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.\n\nNote: since there are two players, "drawn equally from the other players" means: the 1 additional point to the player choosing A0 is taken from the other player (i.e., the other player loses 1 point).\n\nSo the **contract modifies the payoffs** as follows:\n\nWhen a player chooses A0 → they gain +1, the other player loses 1.\n\nWhen a player chooses A1 → no change.\n\nSo the **new payoff matrix** becomes:\n\n|            | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |\n|------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **P1: A0** | (2+1, 2−1) = (3,1) | (0+1, 3−1) = (1,2) |\n| **P1: A1** | (3−1, 0+1) = (2,1) | (1,1)          |\n\nWait — clarify the contract: "received an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."\n\nSo:\n- If Player 1 chooses A0, they get +1, and Player 2 loses 1.\n- If Player 2 chooses A0, they get +1, and Player 1 loses 1.\n\nSo for any action A0 by a player, the player gains 1, the other loses 1.\n\nThus, new payoffs:\n\n**Case: P1:A0, P2:A0**\n- P1 gets: 2 (base) + 1 (contract) = 3\n- P2 gets: 2 (base) - 1 (contract) = 1\n\n**Case: P1:A0, P2:A1**\n- P1 gets: 0 (base) + 1 = 1\n- P2 gets: 3 (base) - 1 = 2\n\n**Case: P1:A1, P2:A0**\n- P1 gets: 3 (base) - 1 = 2\n- P2 gets: 0 (base) + 1 = 1\n\n**Case: P1:A1, P2:A1**\n- P1 gets: 1 (base) + 0 = 1\n- P2 gets: 1 (base) + 0 = 1\n\nSo the new payoff matrix (P1, P2):\n\n|            | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |\n|------------|--------|--------|\n| **P1: A0** | (3,1)  | (1,2)  |\n| **P1: A1** | (2,1)  | (1,1)  |\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the game under the contract\n\nNow, we compute Nash equilibria under the contract.\n\nLet’s find best responses.\n\n**Player 1\'s best responses:**\n\n- If P2 plays A0 (q=1):\n  - P1: A0 → 3, A1 → 2 → better to play A0\n\n- If P2 plays A1 (q=0):\n  - P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent\n\nSo for P2 playing A1, P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.\n\nNow, suppose P2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q)\n\nE[A0] = q×3 + (1−q)×1 = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1  \nE[A1] = q×2 + (1−q)×1 = 2q + 1 − q = q + 1\n\nCompare:  \n2q + 1 vs q + 1 → 2q + 1 > q + 1 → q > 0\n\nSo:\n- If q > 0 → A0 better\n- If q = 0 → both give 1 → indifferent\n\nSo P1’s best response:\n- Play A0 if q > 0\n- Indifferent if q = 0\n\nNow Player 2’s best responses:\n\nIf P1 plays A0 with p, A1 with (1−p)\n\nE[A0] for P2 = p×1 + (1−p)×1 = 1  \nE[A1] for P2 = p×2 + (1−p)×1 = 2p + 1 − p = p + 1\n\nCompare:\n- p + 1 vs 1 → p + 1 > 1 → p > 0\n\nSo:\n- If p > 0 → A1 better\n- If p = 0 → both give 1 → indifferent\n\nSo P2’s best response:\n- Play A1 if p > 0\n- Indifferent if p = 0\n\nNow find Nash equilibria.\n\nTry (A0, A0): q=1, p=1\n- P1: A0 gives 3, A1 gives 2 → A0 best\n- P2: A0 gives 1, A1 gives 2 → A1 better → not best response\n→ not NE\n\nTry (A0, A1): p=1, q=0\n- P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent → A0 OK\n- P2: A1 → 2, A0 → 1 → A1 best → OK\n→ (A0, A1) is NE\n\nTry (A1, A0): p=0, q=1\n- P1: A0 → 3, A1 → 2 → A0 better → not best\n→ not NE\n\nTry (A1, A1): p=0, q=0\n- P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent → A1 OK\n- P2: A0 → 1, A1 → 1 → indifferent → A1 OK\n→ (A1, A1) is NE\n\nAlso, when p=0, q=0: both are indifferent → (A1, A1) is NE.\n\nNow, are there other mixed equilibria?\n\nWe can look for a mixed equilibrium where both mix.\n\nBut note: the only way for P1 to be indifferent is if q = 0 (from earlier: E[A0] = 2q + 1, E[A1] = q + 1 → equal when 2q+1 = q+1 → q=0)\n\nSimilarly, for P2 to be indifferent: p + 1 = 1 → p = 0\n\nSo the only way both are indifferent is when p=0 and q=0 — which gives (A1,A1)\n\nSo the only Nash equilibria are:\n1. (A0, A1) — P1: A0, P2: A1\n2. (A1, A1) — both choose A1\n\nNow examine the payoffs:\n- (A0, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 2\n- (A1, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 1\n\nSo in both cases, P1 gets 1 point.\n\nBut wait — in (A0, A1), P1 gets 1.\n\nBut is (A0, A1) stable? Yes, because:\n- P1: if P2 plays A1, then P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1, so A0 is acceptable.\n- P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A1 (2 > 1)\n\nSo it’s a NE.\n\nBut now — could P1 get more?\n\nSuppose P1’s goal is to **maximize their own payoff**, and we’re in a one-shot game.\n\nBut we must consider: **If the contract is signed, it becomes active only if both players sign it.**\n\nSo we are deciding whether to **sign** the contract.\n\nCurrently, **Player 1 proposed the contract**, and it requires **approval voting** — meaning both players must agree for it to be active.\n\nSo if **I (Player 1)** don’t sign, the contract doesn’t activate.\n\nIf I sign, but the other player doesn’t, the contract doesn’t activate.\n\nSo my decision to sign is meaningless unless **both** sign.\n\nBut the question is: **should I sign the contract?**\n\nWe must decide: does signing help me get a higher expected payoff?\n\nBut **we don’t know what the other player will do**.\n\nWe must assume rational play.\n\nLet’s consider both scenarios:\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 1: Contract is **not** signed (default game)\n\nAs established, A1 strictly dominates A0 for both players → (A1, A1) is the unique NE → both choose A1, get 1 point each.\n\nSo my payoff: **1**\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 2: Contract **is** signed\n\nNow the game becomes the modified one:\n- Payoffs as above\n- Nash equilibria: (A0, A1) and (A1, A1)\n\nIn both, **P1 gets 1 point**.\n\nSo **my payoff is 1 regardless**.\n\nBut wait — could I get more? Could there be a way to force an outcome where I get more?\n\nIn (A0, A1), I get 1.\n\nIn (A1, A1), I get 1.\n\nBut could I get higher than 1?\n\nLet’s see: is there a possibility that both players are willing to coordinate on something else?\n\nBut no — (A0,A0) is not a NE: if P2 plays A0, P1 wants to play A0, but P2 does not want to play A0 (since A1 gives 2 > 1), so P2 will deviate.\n\nSimilarly, (A0,A0) is not stable.\n\nSo the only equilibria give P1 a payoff of 1.\n\nSame as in the base game.\n\nSo **my payoff is 1 in both cases**.\n\nBut wait — is there a **risk** of getting less?\n\nNo — in both games, the worst I can get is 1.\n\nBut in the contract game, **is there a possibility that I could get more than 1?**\n\nLet’s see:\n\n- If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0 → I get 3 → better.\n- But P2 has no incentive to play A0 — because if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 1 from A0, but 2 from A1 → so P2 will play A1.\n\nSo (A0,A0) is not stable.\n\nSimilarly, if I play A0, P2 will play A1 → I get 1.\n\nIf I play A1, P2 might play A1 or A0 → but if P2 plays A0, I get 2; if P2 plays A1, I get 1.\n\nBut P2’s incentive: if I play A1, P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1? No:\n\n- If P1 plays A1, then P2 gets:\n  - A0: 1\n  - A1: 1\n→ so P2 is indifferent.\n\nSo if P1 plays A1, P2 could play A0 or A1.\n\nSo if P2 plays A0 with some probability, then P1 gets more than 1 sometimes.\n\nBut can I exploit that?\n\nOnly if I can **induce** P2 to play A0.\n\nBut P2 will only play A0 if it gives same or better payoff.\n\nBut if P1 plays A1:\n- P2 gets 1 for A0, 1 for A1 → indifferent.\n\nSo P2 might play A0.\n\nBut if P2 plays A0, then P1 gets 2 (from A1,A0 → (2,1))\n\nBut P2 might not play A0.\n\nBut now consider: **if the contract is signed, and I play A1**, then I get:\n- If P2 plays A0: 2\n- If P2 plays A1: 1\n\nBut P2 is indifferent — so P2 could choose A0.\n\nSo **if** P2 plays A0, I get 2.\n\nBut **if** P2 plays A1, I get 1.\n\nSo my expected payoff depends on P2’s behavior.\n\nSimilarly, if I play A0:\n- If P2 plays A1: I get 1 (since (A0,A1) → (1,2))\n- If P2 plays A0: I get 3 → but P2 won’t play A0 because P2 prefers A1.\n\nSo P2 will play A1 if I play A0 → I get 1.\n\nSo:\n- If I play A0 → I get 1 (since P2 will respond with A1)\n- If I play A1 → I could get 2 (if P2 plays A0) or 1 (if P2 plays A1)\n\nBut in equilibrium, we assume rational play.\n\nLet’s reconsider the equilibria.\n\nWe have:\n1. (A0, A1) → P1 gets 1\n2. (A1, A1) → P1 gets 1\n3. Is (A1, A0) an equilibrium? No: P1 would prefer A0 (3 > 2), so no.\n4. Is (A0, A0)? No: P2 prefers A1 (2 > 1)\n\nSo the only equilibria are (A0,A1) and (A1,A1)\n\nNow, **if I play A1**, and P2 is rational, they don\'t have a strict preference — they are indifferent.\n\nSo P2 could play A0, but only if they expect that I will play A1.\n\nBut if P2 believes P1 will play A1, then P2 is indifferent and could mix.\n\nBut then we need a mixed strategy equilibrium.\n\nLet’s suppose P1 plays A1 with probability 1.\n\nThen P2 gets 1 for A0, 1 for A1 → indifferent.\n\nSo P2 can play any mix.\n\nSimilarly, if P2 plays A0 with probability r, and A1 with 1−r.\n\nNow, P1’s expected payoff from playing A0: r×3 + (1−r)×1 = 3r + 1 − r = 2r + 1  \nFrom playing A1: r×2 + (1−r)×1 = 2r + 1 − r = r + 1\n\nSo P1 prefers A0 if 2r + 1 > r + 1 → r > 0\n\nSo if r > 0 (P2 plays A0 with positive probability), P1 wants to play A0.\n\nBut if P1 plays A0, then P2 should play A1 (since if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 2 from A1, 1 from A0)\n\nSo only if P2 plays A1, it’s consistent with P1 playing A1.\n\nThus, the only stable outcome is when P2 plays A1 → then P1 is indifferent (A0 gives 1, A1 gives 1) → so P1 can play A1.\n\nSo (A1, A1) is an equilibrium.\n\nIf P1 plays A0, then P2 plays A1 → (A0, A1) is an equilibrium.\n\nBut if P1 plays A1 and P2 is uncertain, P1 has incentive to deviate to A0 if P2 plays A0 with positive probability.\n\nTherefore, the **only robust equilibrium** is (A1, A1), or possibly (A0, A1).\n\nBut in both, I get 1.\n\nSo no way to get more than 1 under the contract.\n\nBut **critical point**: in the *base game*, I also get 1.\n\nSo expected payoff under contract is still **1**.\n\nBut wait — **what if I sign the contract and then the other player signs?**\n\nIn that case, would'

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 2 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 1 points, the other player gets 1 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

This is a two-player simultaneous choice game with the following base payoffs:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | (2, 2)     | (0, 3)     |
| **A1**                        | (3, 0)     | (1, 1)     |

This is a variant of a coordination game with an asymmetry: playing A1 against A0 gives you 3 (better), but if both play A1, you only get 1. If you play A0 when opponent plays A1, you get 0.

In the base game, neither player has a dominant strategy, and this resembles a **battle of the sexes** or **coordination with conflict**, where there is a tension between mutual cooperation and individual gain.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract (Which Modifies Payoffs)**

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+1 point**, drawn **equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional **-1 point**, distributed **equally among the other players**.

Since there are only **two players**, "the other player" means the **opponent**.

So, this contract introduces a **transfer between players based on their action**:

- If **you choose A0**, you **gain +1**, and the **other player loses 1**.
- If **you choose A1**, you **lose -1**, and the **other player gains +1**.

This is a **pure transfer mechanism** that depends only on your own action — not on the opponent's.

So, effectively, the **final payoff** to each player is the **base payoff** **plus** this **contract adjustment**.

---

### **Step 3: Compute Total Payoffs (Base + Contract Adjustments)**

Let’s define:

- Let your action be X (A0 or A1)
- Let opponent’s action be Y (A0 or A1)

Then your **total payoff** is:
> Base payoff (from the table) + contract adjustment

Similarly for opponent.

So let's recompute the full payoff matrix under the contract.

---

#### **Case 1: You A0, Opponent A0**

- Base: (2, 2)
- You: A0 → +1 → total: 3
- Opponent: A0 → +1 → total: 3
- → (3, 3)

#### **Case 2: You A0, Opponent A1**

- Base: (0, 3)
- You: A0 → +1 → total: 1
- Opponent: A1 → -1 → total: 2
- → (1, 2)

#### **Case 3: You A1, Opponent A0**

- Base: (3, 0)
- You: A1 → -1 → total: 2
- Opponent: A0 → +1 → total: 1
- → (2, 1)

#### **Case 4: You A1, Opponent A1**

- Base: (1, 1)
- You: A1 → -1 → total: 0
- Opponent: A1 → -1 → total: 0
- → (0, 0)

---

### **Updated Payoff Matrix (With Contract)**

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | (3, 3)     | (1, 2)     |
| **A1**                        | (2, 1)     | (0, 0)     |

This is now the **new game** you face.

You are Player 1.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the New Game**

Let’s analyze for rational play.

#### Is there a dominant strategy?

Check your best response:

- If opponent plays A0:
  - You get: A0 → 3, A1 → 2 → **A0 is better**
- If opponent plays A1:
  - You get: A0 → 1, A1 → 0 → **A0 is better**

**So, A0 is strictly better than A1 in both cases.**

✅ Therefore, **A0 is a dominant strategy** for you.

Similarly, look at the opponent’s payoffs:
- If you play A0:
  - Opponent: A0 → 3, A1 → 2 → prefers A0
- If you play A1:
  - Opponent: A0 → 1, A1 → 0 → prefers A0

So A0 is also a **dominant strategy for the opponent**.

---

### **Step 5: Nash Equilibrium and Expected Outcome**

Since both players have **A0** as a dominant strategy, the unique Nash equilibrium is:
> **(A0, A0)**

Given that both players rationally choose their dominant strategy, the outcome will be (A0, A0) with probability 1.

And in this case, **you get 3 points**.

---

### **Step 6: What Should You Do?**

You are to choose a **probability distribution over A0 and A1**.

Since A0 is **dominant**, you should **always play A0**.

Any deviation to A1 would reduce your payoff regardless of what the other player does.

- Playing A1 when opponent plays A0: you get 2 < 3
- Playing A1 when opponent plays A1: you get 0 < 1

Even if the opponent might not be rational, **A0 is still the safe, dominant choice**.

Moreover, since the contract rewards A0 (you gain 1), and penalizes A1 (you lose 1), it **strengthens** the incentive to choose A0.

Therefore, **your optimal strategy is to choose A0 with 100% probability**.

---

### **Step 7: Final Output Format**

- Must be a JSON object
- Keys: "A0", "A1"
- Values: integers (percentage points)
- Sum to 100

→ {"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)

This is a classic 2-player simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1's payoffs in bold):

|                | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0**      | 2,2   | 0,3   |
| **P1 A1**      | 3,0   | 1,1   |

This is a **non-zero-sum game** with asymmetric payoffs.

We are to choose a **mixed strategy** (probability distribution over A0 and A1) that maximizes **our expected payoff**, assuming the other player is also rational and will also try to maximize their own payoff.

But note: **The contract was rejected by Player 1 (you)**. So, even though the contract was proposed and selected via approval voting, since **you rejected it**, it is **not active**.

Thus, we play the **original game** with no contract modifications.

---

### Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the base game

We are Player 1. We need to find the optimal mixed strategy for us, assuming the other player is rational and will respond rationally as well.

Let’s denote:
- Let **p** = probability that you (Player 1) play A0 → then A1 is (1–p)
- Let **q** = probability that the other player (Player 2) plays A0 → then A1 is (1–q)

#### Expected payoff for Player 1:

- If you play A0: payoff = 2q + 0(1–q) = 2q
- If you play A1: payoff = 3q + 1(1–q) = 3q + 1 – q = 2q + 1

To make the other player indifferent (in equilibrium), the expected payoff from A0 and A1 should be equal **from their perspective**.

Wait — we are trying to find our own optimal mix. We should find the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

So in a mixed strategy NE:
- The other player (P2) must be indifferent between A0 and A1.
- We (P1) must be indifferent between A0 and A1 given P2’s strategy.

But actually: in a Nash equilibrium, each player chooses best response to the other.

Let’s find the mixed strategy NE.

---

#### Player 2’s indifference condition (to make Player 1 indifferent):

Wait — reverse: Player 2 will mix only if they are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Let’s find Player 2’s best response.

Player 2’s payoffs:
- If they play A0: payoff = 2p + 0(1–p) = 2p
- If they play A1: payoff = 3p + 1(1–p) = 3p + 1 – p = 2p + 1

So Player 2 prefers A1 if 2p + 1 > 2p → always true? Wait: 2p + 1 > 2p → yes, always.

So for **any p > 0**, Player 2’s expected payoff for A1 (2p + 1) > A0 (2p), so A1 gives strictly better payoff.

Only if p = 0 (P1 always plays A1), then:
- A0: 2(0) = 0
- A1: 2(0) + 1 = 1 → still better

So **Player 2 always prefers A1**, no matter what p is.

That suggests Player 2 will **play A1 with probability 1** in equilibrium.

Now, knowing that, what should Player 1 do?

If P2 plays A1, then:
- If P1 plays A0: gets 0
- If P1 plays A1: gets 1

So P1 prefers A1.

Thus, both players play A1 in pure strategy.

So **(A1, A1)** is a Nash equilibrium: (1,1)

Is there another equilibrium?

Let’s check if Player 1 can make Player 2 indifferent.

Set P2’s payoff from A0 = payoff from A1:

2p = 2p + 1 → 0 = 1 → impossible.

So **no p makes P2 indifferent** — A1 is strictly dominant for P2.

Similarly, check if A0 is dominant for P1?

P1’s payoffs:
- A0: 2q
- A1: 2q + 1

So A1 always gives 1 more than A0, regardless of q.

Therefore, **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 1**.

So both players have A1 as **strictly dominant strategy**.

Wait — let's double-check:

- For P1:
  - If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 2 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A1
  - If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 (A0), 1 (A1) → prefers A1
  → A1 is strictly better in both cases

- For P2:
  - If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 2 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A1
  - If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0 (A0), 1 (A1) → prefers A1
  → A1 strictly dominates A0

So both players have **strictly dominant strategies**: **A1**

Therefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, yielding (1,1)

---

### Step 3: Implications for strategy choice

Since both players have a strictly dominant strategy of A1, we should play A1 with probability 100%, because:

- It’s a best response regardless of what the other player does.
- Playing A0 is strictly worse in all cases.
- Therefore, no rational player would ever play A0.

Even in a mixed strategy, no point in randomizing — A1 is strictly better.

---

### Step 4: Consider the contract? But it's rejected.

The contract was:
- If you play A0 → get +1 point, paid by the other player.
- If you play A1 → no extra payments.

But **you rejected it**, so even if it were active, you wouldn’t get to use it.

So **ignore it entirely**.

No additional incentives.

---

### Step 5: Conclusion

Your optimal strategy is to play A1 with 100% probability.

This maximizes your expected payoff no matter what the other player does.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

Let me organize my payoffs (as Player 1):
- If Player 2 plays A0: I get 2 from A0, or 3 from A1
- If Player 2 plays A1: I get 0 from A0, or 1 from A1

## Step 2: Check for Dominant Strategy

Comparing my options:
- Against Player 2's A0: A1 gives me 3 > A0 gives me 2
- Against Player 2's A1: A1 gives me 1 > A0 gives me 0

**A1 strictly dominates A0** - regardless of what Player 2 does, I'm always better off choosing A1.

## Step 3: Consider Mixed Strategies

Let's verify there's no beneficial mixed strategy. If I play A0 with probability p and Player 2 plays A0 with probability q:

Expected payoff = 2pq + 0·p(1-q) + 3(1-p)q + 1(1-p)(1-q)
                = 2pq + 3q - 3pq + 1 - p - q + pq
                = 2q + 1 - p

To maximize this, I should minimize p, meaning p = 0 (play A1 with certainty).

## Step 4: Context from Contract Rejection

While Player 2 rejected the contract (which would have led to better outcomes for both), this doesn't change the game theory analysis. In the original game:
- Even if Player 2 plays A0 with some probability, A1 is still my best response
- If Player 2 is rational, they'll also play A1 (since this is a Prisoner's Dilemma)
- My payoff from A1 is always 1 point higher than A0, regardless of Player 2's probability distribution

## Conclusion

The rational strategy is to play A1 with 100% probability, as it strictly dominates A0.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

Since I'm Player 2, my payoffs are:
- If I play A0 and Player 1 plays A0: I get **2**
- If I play A0 and Player 1 plays A1: I get **0**  
- If I play A1 and Player 1 plays A0: I get **3**
- If I play A1 and Player 1 plays A1: I get **1**

## Step 2: Identify the Game Structure

This is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma game. The contract that was proposed (but rejected) would have helped encourage cooperation, but we're playing without it.

## Step 3: Analyze My Best Responses

Let me check what's best for me given each possible choice by Player 1:

**If Player 1 plays A0:**
- I get 2 from playing A0
- I get 3 from playing A1
- **A1 is better** (3 > 2)

**If Player 1 plays A1:**
- I get 0 from playing A0
- I get 1 from playing A1  
- **A1 is better** (1 > 0)

## Step 4: Check for Dominance

A1 strictly dominates A0 for me. No matter what Player 1 does, I always get more points by playing A1.

## Step 5: Verify with Expected Values

Even if Player 1 uses a mixed strategy (probability p for A0, probability 1-p for A1):
- Expected payoff from A0: 2p + 0(1-p) = 2p
- Expected payoff from A1: 3p + 1(1-p) = 2p + 1

Since the expected payoff from A1 is always 1 point higher than A0 regardless of p, A1 is the optimal choice.

## Conclusion

My dominant strategy is to play A1 with 100% probability to maximize my expected points.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to decide whether to sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

This is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns; you are Player 2):

|           | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (2, 2)        | (0, 3)        |
| **Player 2: A1** | (3, 0)        | (1, 1)        |

This is a variant of a coordination game with a twist: there’s an incentive to mismatch when the other player plays A0 (since choosing A1 gives you 3 instead of 2), but matching on A1 gives 1 each, which is worse than A0-A0.

We look for Nash equilibria in the base game.

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria:
- (A0, A0): If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 2 (if A0) vs 0 (if A1) → prefers A0. If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 2 vs 3 → prefers A1. So not equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 plays A1 → Player 2 gets 0, Player 1 gets 3. But if Player 2 switches to A1, they get 1 > 0 → not stable.
- (A1, A0): Player 2 A1, Player 1 A0 → Player 2 gets 3, Player 1 gets 0. But Player 1 would prefer to switch to A1 and get 1 > 0 → not stable.
- (A1, A1): Both get 1. If Player 1 deviates to A0, they get 0 < 1 → no incentive. Same for Player 2. So (A1, A1) is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.

#### Mixed Strategy Equilibrium?

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p).  
You (Player 2) want to find best response.

Your expected payoff for choosing A0:
- If Player 1 plays A0 (prob p): you get 2
- If Player 1 plays A1 (prob 1−p): you get 0  
→ E[A0] = 2p + 0(1−p) = 2p

Your expected payoff for choosing A1:
- If Player 1 plays A0: you get 3
- If Player 1 plays A1: you get 1  
→ E[A1] = 3p + 1(1−p) = 3p + 1 − p = 2p + 1

Compare E[A1] − E[A0] = (2p + 1) − 2p = 1 > 0 → A1 always gives 1 more than A0, **regardless of p**.

So you **always prefer A1** over A0, no matter what Player 1 does.

That means in the base game, **your best response is always A1**.

Similarly, from Player 1's perspective:
If you (Player 2) play A1, Player 1 gets:
- A0: 0
- A1: 1 → so prefers A1

If you play A0, Player 1 gets:
- A0: 2
- A1: 3 → so prefers A1

So Player 1 also always prefers A1.

Therefore, the **only Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1), where both get 1 point.

But wait — earlier we saw that (A1, A1) is stable, and indeed, no player has incentive to deviate.

So, **without contract**, if both players act rationally, the outcome will be (A1, A1) → both get 1 point.

But is that the only outcome? Could you get more?

Well, if both could coordinate on (A0, A0), both get 2 — better than 1. But why would Player 1 prefer A0 if you're playing A0? They’d get 2 vs 3 by switching to A1. So no incentive to play A0.

Thus, **(A0, A0)** is not stable.

Therefore, in the base game, **(A1, A1)** is the only reasonable equilibrium — you get 1 point.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

The contract is:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So:
- If you play A0, you get +1 point (paid by the other player).
- If you play A1, nothing changes.

But crucially: **the payment is drawn equally from the other players**.

So if **you** play A0, you get +1 point, and the **other player** must pay 1 point (since "drawn equally from the other players" — only one other player, so the entire 1 point comes from them).

So the contract effectively **subsidizes playing A0 by 1 point**, but at the cost of **1 point to the other player**.

So now the payoff changes.

---

### Step 3: Modify Payoffs with Contract

Assume the contract is signed (so both players are bound by it).

Let’s define the **new** payoff matrix (you are Player 2):

|           | P1: A0        | P1: A1        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **P2: A0** | (2 + 1, 2 − 1) = (3, 1) | (0 + 1, 3 − 1) = (1, 2) |
| **P2: A1** | (3 − 1, 0 + 1) = (2, 1) | (1, 1)        |

Wait — careful!

When you play A0, you get +1, and the other player pays 1 → that is, **your payoff increases by 1**, the opponent’s decreases by 1.

When you play A1, nothing changes — no additional payment.

So for **each player**, playing A0 gives them +1, and the other player loses 1.

So:
- If both play A0: you get 2 + 1 = 3, opponent gets 2 − 1 = 1
- If you play A0, opponent A1: you get 0 + 1 = 1, opponent gets 3 − 1 = 2
- If you play A1, opponent A0: you get 3 − 1 = 2, opponent gets 0 + 1 = 1
- If both play A1: both get 1, no change

So updated payoff matrix (Player 1 row, Player 2 column):

|           | P1: A0        | P1: A1        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **P2: A0** | (3, 1)        | (1, 2)        |
| **P2: A1** | (2, 1)        | (1, 1)        |

Now, let’s analyze this new game from your perspective (Player 2).

We want to see if, **under the contract**, you would get more expected points than without.

#### Analyze your strategy:

For each of P1's actions, what is your best response?

- If P1 plays A0:
  - You play A0 → get 1
  - You play A1 → get 2 → prefer A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - You play A0 → get 2
  - You play A1 → get 1 → prefer A0

So you **switch depending on what P1 does**.

Now, what is P1’s best response?

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 A0 → get 3
  - P1 A1 → get 1 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 A0 → get 2
  - P1 A1 → get 1 → prefers A0

So **P1 always prefers A0**, regardless of what you do.

That means P1 will play A0 with probability 1.

Then your best response: since P1 plays A0, you get:
- A0: 1
- A1: 2 → so you pick A1

So the only Nash equilibrium in this game is:
- P1 plays A0 (always)
- You play A1

Then payoff: (2, 1)

Wait — let’s check:

- P1 plays A0
- You play A1
- Payoff: you get 3 − 1 = 2 (since you chose A1, no +1, but P1 chose A0 so they gain +1, you lose 1 from their choice)
- P1 gets 0 + 1 = 1? No!

Wait — error here.

Let’s re-express **who gets the +1 and who loses 1.**

The contract says:
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.

So:
- The **player who plays A0** gets +1
- The **other player(s)** lose 1 (since payment is drawn from them)

So in case:
- P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +1
- P2 (you) lose 1 (because you're the only other player)

- P2 plays A0 → you get +1
- P1 loses 1

So now, the **payoffs depend on who plays A0**.

Let’s recompute the full matrix carefully:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (you get +1) | A1 (you get no bonus) |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| **A0 (P1 gets +1)** | P1: 2 + 1 = 3, P2: 2 − 1 = 1 | P1: 0 + 1 = 1, P2: 3 − 1 = 2 |
| **A1 (P1 gets no bonus)** | P1: 3 − 1 = 2, P2: 0 + 1 = 1 | P1: 1, P2: 1 |

Wait — this is wrong.

Actually, the **bonus is paid to the player who chooses A0**, and **comes from the other player**.

So:

- When P1 chooses A0: P1 gets +1, P2 loses 1 (from the contract)
- When P1 chooses A1: no bonus for P1, so no change
- When P2 chooses A0: P2 gets +1, P1 loses 1
- When P2 chooses A1: no bonus, no change

But the **payoff is the base payoff plus the contract adjustment**.

So combine:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | base: (2,2), but P1 played A0 (+1), P2 played A0 (+1) → both get +1, but P1’s +1 comes from P2, P2’s +1 comes from P1 → net: (2+1−1, 2+1−1) = (2, 2) | P1 plays A0 (+1), P2 plays A1 → so P1 gets +1, P2 gets nothing → P1: 0+1=1, P2: 3 → but P1 is getting +1, so P2 loses 1? Wait.

Let’s clarify: **“drawn equally from the other players”**

So if you play A0, you get +1, and **the payment is shared equally among the other players**.

There is only one other player → so you get +1 from them.

So:
- If you (P2) play A0 → you get +1, P1 loses 1
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +1, P2 loses 1

So it’s a **direct transfer**: whoever plays A0 gets +1, the other loses 1.

So the total effect: **the player who plays A0 gains 1, the other loses 1**, **in addition to the base payoff**.

So now, let’s recompute.

#### Full payoff matrix with contract:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (you get +1) | A1 (you get 0) |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **A0 (P1 gets +1)** | P1: 2 + 1 = 3, P2: 2 − 1 = 1 | P1: 0 + 1 = 1, P2: 3 |
| **A1 (no change)** | P1: 3 − 1 = 2, P2: 0 + 1 = 1 | P1: 1, P2: 1 |

Wait: when P1 plays A1 (no bonus), and P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +1, P1 loses 1 → so:
- P1 gets base 3 (from P2 playing A0) minus 1 (because P2 played A0) = 2
- P2 gets base 0 (from P1 playing A1) plus 1 (because P2 played A0) = 1

Yes.

Similarly:
- P1 A1, P2 A1: both get base (1,1), no bonus → (1,1)
- P1 A0, P2 A0: base (2,2), but both played A0 → P1 gets +1, loses 1 (from P2), so net 2; P2 gets +1, loses 1 (from P1), so net 2 → (2,2)
- P1 A1, P2 A0: P1 gets base 3 (since P2 plays A0), and since P2 played A0, P1 loses 1 → P1: 3 − 1 = 2; P2 gets base 0, and because P2 played A0, gets +1 → 0+1=1 → (2,1)

Wait — this contradicts earlier thought.

Let’s fix this rigorously.

---

### Corrected Payoff Matrix with Contract

Let’s define:

- Base payoff from game
- Then add: **+1 to each player who played A0**, **−1 to each player who played A1**? No.

No: **the bonus for playing A0 is paid by the other player(s)**.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get +1
- This +1 comes from the other player(s)

So for **each player**:
- If you played A0 → +1
- If you played A1 → 0 additional

But the **source** of the +1 is the other player(s): **each opponent loses 1 if you play A0**.

So total change:
- Player who plays A0: +1
- Each opponent who plays A1: −1
- Each opponent who plays A0: loses 1 (because they are also playing A0, so their +1 is paid by you)

Wait — this is more subtle.

Suppose **both play A0**:
- P1 played A0 → gets +1
- P2 played A0 → gets +1
- But the source: the +1 for P1 must come from P2 → P2 loses 1
- The +1 for P2 must come from P1 → P1 loses 1
- So net: P1: +1 −1 = 0 change → so P1 keeps base payoff
- P2: +1 −1 = 0 → keeps base

So outcome: (2,2)

Now, if **P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1**:
- P1 played A0 → gets +1
- P2 played A1 → gains nothing
- The +1 for P1 must come from P2 → P2 loses 1
- P2 played A1 → no bonus, no cost
- So P1: base 0 + 1 = 1, but loses 1 → net 0
- Wait — no: P1 gets +1 (from contract), but since P2 played A1, P2 doesn’t get +1, but P2 **pays** 1 to P1 for P1’s A0 → so P2 loses 1
- So P1: base 0 +1 (bonus) = 1, but **paid by P2**, so net: 1
- P2: base 3 (from P1 playing A0) minus 1 (because P1 played A0) = 2

Wait — P1 playing A0 means P1 gets +1, and P2 pays 1 to P1.

P2 playing A1 → P2 gets no +1, and doesn’t pay anything for others.

So yes:
- P1: base 0 + 1 = 1
- P2: base 3 − 1 = 2

Similarly:
- P1 A1, P2 A0:
- P1 plays A1 → no bonus, no cost
- P2 plays A0 → gets +1
- The +1 must come from P1 → P1 loses 1
- So P1: base 3 − 1 = 2
- P2: base 0 + 1 = 1

- P1 A1, P2 A1:
- No one plays A0 → no bonus, no cost → (1,1)

- P1 A0, P2 A0:
- Both play A0 → each gets +1, but each must pay 1 to the other
- So net: +1 −1 = 0 for each
- Base payoff: 2,2 → final: (2,2)

So final matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **A0** | (2,2)    | (1,2)    |
| **A1** | (2,1)    | (1,1)    |

Wait — this is inconsistent with earlier.

Let’s tabulate:

1. P1 A0, P2 A0:
   - P1: base 2, +1 (A0), −1 (paid to P2) → 2
   - P2: base 2, +1 (A0), −1 (paid to P1) → 2 → (2,2)

2. P1 A0, P2 A1:
   - P1: base 0, +1 (A0), −1 (P2 plays A1, so no +1 to P2 to pay) → but P1 gets +1, so P2 must pay 1
   - So P1: 0 + 1 = 1
   - P2: base 3, no bonus, but pays 1 to P1 → 3 − 1 = 2 → (1,2)

3. P1 A1, P2 A0:
   - P1: base 3, no bonus (A1), but since P2 played A0, P1 must pay 1 → 3 − 1 = 2
   - P2: base 0, +1 (A0) → 0 + 1 = 1 → (2,1)

4. P1 A1, P2 A1:
   - Neither plays A0 → no bonuses → base (1,1) → (1,1)

So yes, final matrix:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0    | (2,2) | (1,2) |
| P1: A1    | (2,1) | (1,1) |

Now, you are Player 2.

Let’s compute your best response.

If P1 plays A0:
- You play A0 → get 2
- You play A1 → get 2 → indifferent

If P1 plays A1:
- You play A0 → get 1
- You play A1 → get 1 → indifferent

So **you are indifferent between A0 and A1 regardless of what P1 does**.

Now, what about P1?

If you play A0:
- P1 plays A0 → gets 2
- P1 plays A1 → gets 2 → indifferent

If you play A1:
- P1 plays A0 → gets 1
- P1 plays A1 → gets 1 → indifferent

So **both players are indifferent between actions**, regardless of the other's choice.

So **any strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium**.

But what’s the **expected payoff**?

You want to maximize your expected payoff.

Since you are indifferent, but you might prefer outcomes where you get more.

Look at the payoffs:
- In (A0,A0): you get 2
- In (A0,A1): you get 2
- In (A1,A0): you get 1
- In (A1,A1): you get 1

So **you get 2 in two cases, 1 in two cases**.

So if both players play A0, you get 2; if you play A0 and P1 plays A1, you get 1; if P1 plays A0 and you play A1, you get 2; etc.

So **the maximum you can get is 2**, minimum 1.

But to get high payoff, you want to **play A0**, because:
- If you play A0, you get 2 if P1 plays A0, 1 if P1 plays A1 → average depends on P1
- If you play A1, you get 2 if P1 plays A0, 1 if P1 plays A1 → same?

Wait:

- If you play A0: you get 2 when P1=A0, 1 when P1=A1 → E = 2p + 1(1−p) = p + 1
- If you play A1: you get 2 when P1=A0, 1 when P1=A1 → same: 2p + 1(1−p) = p + 1

So **expected payoff is the same regardless of your action**, as long as P1’s mix is fixed.

But since P1 is indifferent, P1 might play any mixture.

However, **you can’t be sure**.

But here's the key: in the **base game**, the equilibrium was (A1,A1) → you get 1.

In the **contracted game**, **any profile where someone plays A0 gives you at least 1, and up to 2**.

But can you guarantee a better outcome?

If you **sign the contract**, then both you and P1 are bound by it.

Now, P1 is the proposer (contract proposed by P1, and we vote).

But you now decide whether to sign.

If **both sign**, contract applies.

If you don’t sign, **contract inactive** → game reverts to base game → (A1,A1) → you get 1.

If you **sign**, then contract applies, and the new game begins.

In the new game, **your best strategy is to play A0**, because:
- It gives you at least 1
- If P1 plays A0, you get 2
- If P1 plays A1, you get 1
- But P1, from their perspective, gets:
  - If you play A0:
    - P1 A0: gets 2
    - P1 A1: gets 2 → indifferent
  - If you play A1:
    - P1 A0: gets 1
    - P1 A1: gets 1 → indifferent

So P1 is indifferent.

But P1 wants to **not cooperate** in the sense that they might avoid giving you benefits.

But since P1 is indifferent, we assume they might choose randomly or play A1 to avoid risk.

But crucially, **you can coordinate**: if you both play A0, you get 2 → better than 1.

But can you expect that?

However, in this game, **P1 has no incentive to play A0 unless you play it**, but since P1 is indifferent, they might play A0.

But let’s suppose that **after signing**, both players choose optimally.

Since you get the same expected payoff from A0 and A1 (given P1’s strategy), but **A0 has higher maximum payoff**, and since you can choose, you might want to play A0.

But is there a focal point?

Note: **P1 proposed the contract**.

P1 proposed a contract that benefits A0 players.

So P1 likely wants to play A0.

Moreover, since P1 is indifferent, but **if you play A0, P1 is not worse off**, and might as well play A0.

But can we assume that?

Suppose you sign and play A0.

Then P1’s choices:
- Play A0: gets 2
- Play A1: gets 2 → same

So P1 might play A1.

Then you play A0, P1 plays A1 → you get 1

But if you both play A0 → you get 2

So **better for you to coordinate on (A0,A0)**

But can you ensure that?

In the absence of communication, it’s hard.

But since the contract is signed, and both are rational, **maybe (A0,A0) is a natural equilibrium**.

Because if both play A0, you get 2, which is better than 1.

And there’s no incentive to deviate:
- If you deviate to A1, you get 2 (P1 A0, your A1 → you get 2) → same
- If P1 deviates to A1, P1 gets 1 vs 2 → worse → so P1 won’t deviate

Wait: if you play A0, P1 playing A0 gets 2, playing A1 gets 2 → so indifferent → so **P1 might deviate**.

But if P1 deviates to A1, and you play A0, then P1 gets 2 (from base 3 − 1 = 2) → same as 2

So still indifferent.

So (A0,A0) is an equilibrium.

But also (A1,A1): both get 1 → if you deviate to A0, you get 1 (P1 A1, your A0 → you get 1) → same → so no incentive

But (A0,A0) gives you **2**, which is better than 1.

So **you would prefer (A0,A0)**.

But can you get it?

Only if P1 also plays A0.

But P1 might play A1.

However, P1 will only play A1 if they get same or better payoff.

But since P1 is indifferent, they might play A0.

But to be safe, suppose P1 plays A0 with probability 1.

Then you get:
- If you play A0: 2
- If you play A1: 2 → same

But if you play A0 and P1 plays A0, you get 2.

So you might as well play A0.

But if P1 plays A1, you get 1 either way.

So **your expected payoff depends on P1’s behavior**.

But in the base game, you get 1.

In the contract game, **your expected payoff is at least 1**, and can be 2 if P1 plays A0.

But is P1 likely to play A0?

P1 proposed the contract, which benefits A0 players.

So P1 has a **clear incentive to play A0**.

Moreover, P1 might **expect that both will play A0**.

So likely, if contract is signed, both play A0 → you get 2.

If contract is not signed, you get 1.

Therefore, **signing the contract increases your expected payoff from 1 to at least 1, possibly 2**.

And since you are indifferent in the contract game, but have a **better chance** of getting 2, it is **strictly better to sign**.

Moreover, the contract is **only active if all sign**, so if you don’t sign, it doesn’t apply → you go back to base game → 1 point.

So by signing, you **increase your chance of getting more**.

Even if P1 doesn’t always play A0, your **expected payoff in contract game is at least 1**, and **could be higher if P1 plays A0**.

But in base game, you **always get 1**.

So **signing the contract makes you at least as well off, and possibly better off**.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing your points in the game.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Payoff Matrix

We are playing a simultaneous move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

From the payoff description:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 2           | 2                     |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3                     |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0                     |
| A1          | A1                     | 1           | 1                     |

This is a classic coordination game with some incentive to defect, but also a strong mutual reward for cooperation (A0, A0), and an asymmetric risk-reward structure.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Rationality and Nash Equilibrium

We are Player 1. We want to maximize our own expected payoff, assuming the other player is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s denote:
- Your probability of choosing A0: p
- The other player's probability of choosing A0: q

Your expected payoff:
- If you choose A0:  
  E_A0 = q × 2 + (1−q) × 0 = 2q
- If you choose A1:  
  E_A1 = q × 3 + (1−q) × 1 = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1

You will prefer A0 only if E_A0 ≥ E_A1  
→ 2q ≥ 2q + 1 → 0 ≥ 1 → False

So E_A0 < E_A1 **for all q**.

That means no matter what q is, choosing A1 gives you a strictly higher expected payoff than A0.

Wait — let's double-check:

E_A0 = 2q  
E_A1 = 3q + (1−q)(1) = 3q + 1 − q = 2q + 1

So indeed:  
E_A1 − E_A0 = (2q + 1) − 2q = 1 > 0

Hence, **A1 always gives you 1 point more than A0**, regardless of q.

Therefore, **your best response is always to play A1 (with probability 1)**, no matter what the other player does.

But wait — is that really true?

Let’s test with a few values:

- If q = 0 (other player never plays A0):
  - E_A0 = 0
  - E_A1 = 1 → better
- If q = 1 (other player always plays A0):
  - E_A0 = 2
  - E_A1 = 3 → still better
- If q = 0.5:
  - E_A0 = 1
  - E_A1 = 2q + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 → still better

Indeed, **A1 dominates A0** for you. You always get 1 point more from A1 than A0.

Therefore, **the dominant strategy for Player 1 is to play A1 with probability 1.**

---

### Step 3: Consider the Contract (but remember it's rejected)

The proposed contract said:
- If you choose A0, you get +1 point (from the other player).
- If you choose A1, no additional payments.

But **Player 1 rejected the contract**, so it is **not active**. Therefore, we ignore any extra payment — even though choosing A0 would have given you +1 if the contract were active, it isn't.

So we **cannot rely on the contract at all** — it's dead.

Thus, the original payoffs stand.

---

### Step 4: Conclusion – Optimal Strategy

Since A1 strictly dominates A0 for you (you always get 1 point more), regardless of the other player’s behavior, your rational choice is to **always choose A1**.

So the optimal probability distribution is:
- A0: 0%
- A1: 100%

We don’t need to consider mixed strategies because A1 is unambiguously better.

Even if the other player plays A0 with high probability, A1 still gives you 3 points vs. 2, and when they play A1, you get 1 vs. 0 — so in both cases, A1 wins.

Only possible downside: if you expect the other player to be irrational or not optimizing, but since we assume both players are rational and aim to maximize their own points, the dominant strategy holds.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P2
response:
Let's analyze the game step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Payoff Matrix**

We are Player 2. The payoff matrix is defined as follows, with rows representing your choice (Player 2), and columns representing the other player’s choice (Player 1):

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **You: A0**   | (2, 2)        | (0, 3)        |
| **You: A1**   | (3, 0)        | (1, 1)        |

So:
- If both choose A0 → (2, 2)
- You A0, other A1 → (0, 3)
- You A1, other A0 → (3, 0)
- Both A1 → (1, 1)

This is a **symmetric** game in structure, but we are in the role of Player 2.

---

### **Step 2: The Contract Proposal (Irrelevant Now)**

The contract was:
- If you choose A0 → +1 point from the other player.
- If you choose A1 → no extra payment.

But **Player 1 rejected** the contract, so it is **not active**.

Therefore, we play the **original game only**, with no contract effects. So we can ignore the +1 bonus for A0.

---

### **Step 3: Should we consider the contract in our strategy?**

Even though the contract was not passed, we must consider **what we would have done if it were active**, or if the other player’s perception of it affects their behavior?

But the instruction says:
> You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

So all contract effects are **off**. The only payoff is the original 4 outcomes.

Moreover, the other player (Player 1) **rejected the contract**, which implies they may be **aware** of it but chose not to participate.

Important: **Do they know we’re playing without it?** The game says "You will now play the original game without any contract modifications."

So we must assume that **the contract is inactive**, and **both players know it**.

Thus, the game is just the 2×2 game above, with payoffs as defined.

---

### **Step 4: Find the Nash Equilibrium (Best Response Analysis)**

We are to choose a mixed strategy to maximize our expected payoff, assuming the other player is also rational.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that **Player 1 (other player)** chooses A0.
- $ q $ = probability that **you (Player 2)** choose A0. So you choose A1 with probability $ 1 - q $.

We want to find the optimal $ q $, given that Player 1 will also be trying to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s compute your expected payoff as a function of $ p $ and $ q $:

$$
E_{\text{you}} = q \cdot [p \cdot 2 + (1 - p) \cdot 0] + (1 - q) \cdot [p \cdot 3 + (1 - p) \cdot 1]
$$

Simplify:

$$
E_{\text{you}} = q(2p) + (1 - q)(3p + 1 - p) = 2pq + (1 - q)(2p + 1)
$$

$$
= 2pq + 2p(1 - q) + (1 - q) = 2pq + 2p - 2pq + 1 - q = 2p + 1 - q
$$

So your expected payoff is:
> $ E_{\text{you}} = 2p + 1 - q $

Now, to find the best $ q $, given that Player 1 is choosing $ p $.

But Player 1 is trying to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s compute their expected payoff:

They get:
- If they pick A0: $ q \cdot 2 + (1 - q) \cdot 0 = 2q $
- If they pick A1: $ q \cdot 3 + (1 - q) \cdot 1 = 3q + 1 - q = 2q + 1 $

So:
- Expected payoff for A0: $ 2q $
- Expected payoff for A1: $ 2q + 1 $

We see that **for any $ q $**, $ 2q + 1 > 2q $, so Player 1 **always** prefers A1 over A0, regardless of what you do.

Thus, **Player 1 will always choose A1** in equilibrium, because it strictly dominates A0.

Wait — is that true?

Compare:
- A1 yields $ 2q + 1 $
- A0 yields $ 2q $

So yes: **A1 dominates A0** for Player 1, since $ 2q + 1 > 2q $ for all $ q $.

Therefore, **Player 1 will play A1 with probability 1**.

### **Step 5: Best Response Given That Player 1 Plays A1 Always**

If Player 1 plays A1 with probability 1, then:

- Your choice:
  - If you play A0: get 0 (from the payoff — you A0, other A1 → 0 points)
  - If you play A1: get 1 (both A1 → 1 point)

So:
- A0 → 0
- A1 → 1

So you should play A1 with probability 1.

Wait — but is this stable?

Wait a second — let's double-check.

But earlier we said Player 1 always prefers A1 because it gives them $ 2q + 1 $ vs $ 2q $, so yes, **strictly dominant**.

Therefore, in equilibrium, Player 1 will play A1 with probability 1.

Then, you respond: A1 gives 1, A0 gives 0 → so you should play A1 with probability 1.

So **(A1, A1)** is a Nash equilibrium?

Check:
- If you play A1, and Player 1 plays A1 → you get 1, they get 1.
- Can you profit by deviating? If you play A0, you get 0 < 1 → no.
- Can they profit by deviating? If they play A0, and you play A1 → they get 0 < 1 → no.

So **(A1, A1)** is a Nash equilibrium.

But is it the only one?

Wait — is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?

Suppose Player 1 is mixing with probability $ p $. Then player 2’s best response depends on $ p $.

We had: $ E_{\text{you}} = 2p + 1 - q $

To maximize this, since it's linear in $ q $, we choose $ q = 1 $ if $ -1 < 0 $, which it is, so we **always want to minimize $ q $** (i.e., play A1 more), so **only if the coefficient of $ q $ is negative**.

From $ E_{\text{you}} = 2p + 1 - q $, the derivative w.r.t. $ q $ is -1, so it's decreasing in $ q $ — meaning you want to set $ q = 0 $ (play A1 always), regardless of $ p $.

That means: **No matter what Player 1 does, you should always play A1**.

Because:
- Playing A1 gives you at least 1 (vs 0 if you play A0 when they play A1)
- If they play A0, and you play A1 → you get 3
- If they play A1, you get 1
- So A1 is **weakly better than A0** in all cases.

Let’s verify:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You A0 → 2
  - You A1 → 3 → so A1 better

- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You A0 → 0
  - You A1 → 1 → so A1 better

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for you** as well.

Wait! This is critical.

Looking at your own payoffs:

- When you play A0:
  - You get 2 if they play A0
  - You get 0 if they play A1

- When you play A1:
  - You get 3 if they play A0
  - You get 1 if they play A1

So compare:
- A1 vs A0:
  - If they play A0: A1 gives 3 > 2 → better
  - If they play A1: A1 gives 1 > 0 → better

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2** (you).

Therefore, **you should play A1 with probability 1**.

Similarly, for Player 1:
- If they play A0: get 2 if you play A0, 0 if you play A1
- If they play A1: get 3 if you play A0, 1 if you play A1

So:
- If you play A0: they get 2 vs 3 → A1 better
- If you play A1: they get 0 vs 1 → A1 better

So again, **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 1 too**.

Thus, **both players have A1 as strictly dominant strategy**.

Therefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is **both play A1**.

Thus, the only rational play is to play A1 with probability 100%.

Even if the other player played something else, you're still better off playing A1.

And they will too.

### **Step 6: Conclude the Strategy**

Since A1 is strictly dominant for you, regardless of what the other player does, **you should play A1 with 100% probability**.

Therefore, the optimal probability distribution is:
- A0: 0
- A1: 100

And the sum is 100.

### **Final Answer**

{"A0": 0, "A1": 100}
