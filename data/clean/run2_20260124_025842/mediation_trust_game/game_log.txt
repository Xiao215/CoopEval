response:
To maximize the total points in this game, we first analyze the payoff matrix (with Player 1 as the row player and Player 2 as the column player):

*   **(A0, A0):** P1 = 10, P2 = 10
*   **(A0, A1):** P1 = 0, P2 = 20
*   **(A1, A0):** P1 = 6, P2 = 2
*   **(A1, A1):** P1 = 4, P2 = 4

**Strategic Analysis:**
Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play **A1** (since 20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1's best response to Player 2 playing A1 is to also play **A1** (since 4 > 0). This leads to a Nash equilibrium of (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4). However, both players would prefer the (A0, A0) outcome, which yields (10, 10).

**Mediator Design:**
The goal of the mediator is to facilitate the (10, 10) outcome while ensuring it is "safe" and "fair" enough to be approved by both players.

1.  **If n=2 (Both players delegate):** The mediator should play **A0**. This results in (A0, A0), giving both players 10 points. This is the primary incentive for delegation.
2.  **If n=1 (Only one player delegates):**
    *   If the mediator plays **A0**: If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not, Player 2 will play A1 to get 20, leaving Player 1 with 0. Player 1 will likely never approve a mediator that allows this outcome.
    *   If the mediator plays **A1**: If Player 1 delegates alone, the mediator plays A1 for them. Player 2's best response to A1 is A1, resulting in (4, 4). If Player 2 delegates alone, the mediator plays A1 for them. Player 1's best response to A1 is A1, also resulting in (4, 4).

By setting the action for **n=1** to **A1**, we make delegation "safe." If only one person delegates, the game defaults to the standard Nash equilibrium (4, 4). If both delegate, both players are rewarded with (10, 10). This structure creates a strong incentive for both players to approve the mediator and to delegate their moves.

response:
To maximize the total points in this game, we need to find a mediator that encourages both players to delegate and leads to the highest possible payoff.

1.  **Analyze the Payoff Matrix:**
    *   (A0, A0): (10, 10)
    *   (A0, A1): (0, 20)
    *   (A1, A0): (6, 2)
    *   (A1, A1): (4, 4)
    The Nash equilibrium of the base game is (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4). The highest cooperative payoff is (10, 10) at (A0, A0).

2.  **Design the Mediator:**
    A mediator plays an action on behalf of all delegating players based on the number of players who delegate.
    *   **Goal:** We want the mediator to play **A0** if both players delegate, so they both receive 10 points. 
    *   **Incentivization:** We need to ensure that delegation is the best strategy for both players. If one player delegates, the mediator's action for that player should discourage the other player from acting independently.
    *   If 1 player delegates and the mediator plays **A1**, the other player's best response is to also play **A1** (since A1 vs A1 gives them 4 points, while A0 vs A1 gives them 2 points). This results in a (4, 4) payoff.
    *   If both players delegate, they both play **A0** (as per the mediator's rule for 2 players) and get (10, 10).

3.  **Evaluate the Subgame:**
    With a mediator designed as {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}:
    *   If both players delegate: Payoff is (10, 10).
    *   If only Player 1 delegates: Player 1 plays A1 (via mediator). Player 2 will choose the best response to A1, which is A1. Payoff is (4, 4).
    *   If only Player 2 delegates: Player 2 plays A1 (via mediator). Player 1 will choose the best response to A1, which is A1. Payoff is (4, 4).
    *   If neither delegates: They play the Nash equilibrium (A1, A1). Payoff is (4, 4).

    In this scenario, delegating becomes the dominant strategy for both players (10 is better than 4). This makes the (10, 10) outcome stable and beneficial for both players. This mediator is likely to be approved by both players as it significantly improves upon the base Nash equilibrium.

response:
To design an optimal mediator and maximize points in this game, we need to consider both the potential outcomes and our strategy regarding mutual benefit since the other player has a vested interest as well. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding Payoffs:**
   - Both players choosing A0: Both get 10 points.
   - You choose A0, the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
   - You choose A1, the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
   - Both players choosing A1: Both get 4 points.

2. **Optimal Strategy Without Mediator:**
   - If we aim to maximize individual points just for ourselves, A0 is risky unless mutual cooperation can be ensured, as A1 always guarantees some points.
   - If players always acted independently, repeated rational choice would be A1 to avoid zero points.
   
3. **Mediator Insights:**
   - The mediator's presence changes the dynamics by allowing both players to trust a coordinated action.
   - If both players agree to delegate to a mediator and the mediator plays A0, both players get 10 points.

4. **Mediator Design Strategy:**
   - If 2 players delegate: Play A0 (both benefit maximally).
   - If 1 player delegates: Play A1 (defaulting to safer personal max-inferior gamble since one player chosen not to coordinate).

5. **Approval Voting & Delegation Consideration:**
   - Both players prefer a mediator that maximizes average returns.
   - The logically cooperative strategy would have both players approve a mediator that guarantees mutual optimal moves.

Hence, the mediator should play A0 when both players delegate and A1 when only one delegates.

### Final JSON Output:
```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```

This mediator strategy balances the need for mutual cooperation while protecting against scenarios when mutual delegation doesn’t happen. The potential for high reward is secured if both delegate and safe fallback in cases of a mixed approach.

response:
To approach the problem, we need to carefully analyze the given payoff matrix and the potential strategies that can maximize our points.

### Payoff Analysis:

- **(A0, A0)**: Both players choose A0.
  - Player 2 gets 10 points.
  - Player 1 gets 10 points.

- **(A1, A0)**: Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0.
  - Player 2 gets 20 points.
  - Player 1 gets 0 points.

- **(A0, A1)**: Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1.
  - Player 2 gets 2 points.
  - Player 1 gets 6 points.

- **(A1, A1)**: Both players choose A1.
  - Player 2 gets 4 points.
  - Player 1 gets 4 points.

### Strategy Considerations for the Mediator:
1. **Delegation Situations:**
   - **1 Player Delegating**: If only one player delegates to the mediator, there won't be mutual dependency. The mediator can maximize the points for the delegating player independently.
   - **2 Players Delegating**: If both players delegate to the mediator, a solution that maximizes mutual benefit could be better.

2. **Objectives for Player 2:**
   - The ideal scenario for Player 2 is that either they get 20 points (in (A1, A0) scenario) or both end up with a reasonably high mutual outcome like (A0, A0) for 10 points each.

### Proposed Mediator Strategy:
Given that the mediator will act on behalf of delegating players, our strategy should adhere to maximizing Player 2's points while promoting a consistent approach in the case where both delegate.

#### Reasoning:
- If only one player delegates, the ideal action is "A1", trying to maximize the immediate gain regardless of the other player's choice (20 points if the other uses "A0").
- If two players delegate, aiming for mutual cooperation, "A0" yields a steadfast 10-10 split, maximizing mutual welfare and ensuring stability.

### Final JSON Object:
This should reflect the discussed strategies.

```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```

- **1 Player Delegating**: Mediator chooses "A1".
- **2 Players Delegating**: Mediator chooses "A0".

This proposed strategy should provide a strong approach under the game’s rules, maximizing potential outcomes for Player 2 under both single and double delegations.

- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

The other player has A1 as a **dominant strategy** (they get 20 or 4 vs 10 or 2). This leads to Nash equilibrium at (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4).

However, the **socially optimal** outcome is (A0, A0) with payoffs (10, 10) - much better for both players!

## Step 2: Design Mediator to Enable Cooperation

The challenge is creating a mediator that:
1. Makes both players want to delegate
2. Achieves the cooperative (10, 10) outcome

## Step 3: Consider Mediator Strategy {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

**If 2 players delegate:** Both play A0 → Both get 10 ✓

**If 1 player delegates:** That player plays A1
- If I delegate alone: I play A1, other's best response is A1 → (4, 4)
- If other delegates alone: They play A1, my best response is A1 → (4, 4)

**If 0 players delegate:** Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → (4, 4)

## Step 4: Analyze the Delegation Game

The meta-game of delegation decisions becomes:

|              | Other Delegates | Other Doesn't |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| I Delegate   | 10, 10         | 4, 4          |
| I Don't      | 4, 4           | 4, 4          |

**Delegation is weakly dominant for both players!** We get 10 when both delegate (best case) and never worse than 4 (the Nash outcome).

This mediator creates the right incentives for mutual cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

**Final Answer:**

{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

Let me analyze this game from my perspective as Player 2.

## 1. Understanding the payoff structure

The payoff matrix (My payoff, Player 1's payoff):
```
              Player 1
              A0      A1
Player 2  A0  (10,10) (2,6)
          A1  (20,0)  (4,4)
```

## 2. Analyzing the game without a mediator

- **For me (Player 2):** A1 strictly dominates A0
  - Against their A0: I get 20 vs 10
  - Against their A1: I get 4 vs 2

- **For Player 1:** 
  - If I play A0: they prefer A0 (10 vs 6)
  - If I play A1: they prefer A1 (4 vs 0)

- **Nash Equilibrium:** (A1, A1) = (4, 4)
- **Pareto Optimal:** (A0, A0) = (10, 10)

## 3. Designing the mediator strategy

The mediator needs to:
- When **both delegate**: Achieve the cooperative outcome (10, 10) by playing A0
- When **one delegates**: Prevent exploitation

Let me consider **{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}**:

**Case: Both delegate (key "2"):**
- Mediator plays A0 for both → (10, 10) ✓

**Case: Only one delegates (key "1"):**
- Mediator plays A1 for the delegating player

If only I delegate:
- I play A1, Player 1's best response is A1 → (4, 4)

If only Player 1 delegates:
- They play A1, my best response is A1 → (4, 4)

**Case: Neither delegates:**
- Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

## 4. Resulting delegation game

```
                Player 1
                Delegate    Don't
Player 2  Del   (10, 10)   (4, 4)
          Don't (4, 4)     (4, 4)
```

Both delegating is a Nash equilibrium and achieves the Pareto optimal outcome. This makes delegation attractive to both players while preventing exploitation when only one player delegates.

**Final Answer:**

{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

response:
Let’s break this down step by step to design the best mediator strategy for **Player 1** (yourself), keeping in mind that:

- You are Player 1.
- The payoff matrix is asymmetric — you gain less in some cases than the other player.
- You can choose to **delegate** your move to a mediator or act independently.
- The other player also designs a mediator.
- Then, **both mediators are submitted**, and the one with the **most approvals** wins — if multiple mediators tie for most approvals, one is chosen uniformly at random.
- You and the other player will **approve** mediators (probably each of you can approve one).
- The winning mediator will play **the same action for all players who delegated to it**.

So your goal is to **design a mediator** (a mapping from number of delegators to action) that **maximizes your expected payoff**, considering that:
- You may or may not delegate.
- The other player may or may not delegate.
- You both will vote on which mediator to approve (so, you’ll likely vote for the one you designed, or maybe one that benefits you more).
- The outcome depends on **who delegates** and what mediators do.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

Let’s recall the payoffs (you are Player 1):

| Your Action | Other’s Action | Your Points | Other’s Points |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| A0          | A0             | 10          | 10             |
| A0          | A1             | 0           | 20             |
| A1          | A0             | 6           | 2              |
| A1          | A1             | 4           | 4              |

You prefer:
- A0 when the other plays A0 (get 10 vs. 0).
- A1 when the other plays A1 (get 4 vs. 0).
- But you get 0 if you play A0 and they play A1.
- You get 6 if you play A1 and they play A0 — that’s better than 0.

So you want to:
- Avoid playing A0 if you think the other player will play A1.
- Try to coordinate on (A0, A0) or (A1, A1).
- But (A0, A0) gives you 10 — the best outcome.
- However, if the other player plays A1, you get 0 if you play A0 — so you don’t want that.

This is a coordination game with a *conflict of interest* — the other player benefits from you playing A0 and them playing A1 (they get 20 vs. 10).

Thus, the other player has an incentive to **trap you** into playing A0 while they play A1 — getting you 0.

---

### Step 2: Strategic Implications of Delegation and Mediators

Let’s consider the possible scenarios:

**Case 1: Both players act independently.**  
Then each chooses a mixed strategy. But we don’t yet know what they’ll do.

**Case 2: One player delegates, the other doesn’t.**  
The delegating player’s move is locked by the mediator. The non-delegating player chooses freely.

**Case 3: Both delegate.**  
Then the mediator plays the same action for both players.

Important: **Only one mediator will be used in the final game**, based on approval voting.

Let’s suppose:
- You design a mediator M1.
- The other player designs a mediator M2.
- You and the other player each approve some mediator(s).
- The mediator with the most approvals wins.
- If tie, random.

Who controls the approval? You can approve any mediator you want — so you will likely approve **your own** and possibly theirs if it benefits you.

But to predict outcome, we need to consider **what strategy you should propose** that will:
- Maximize your expected payoff,
- Be **approved by you**, and
- Possibly be **approved by the other player**, or at least not hurt you.

But here’s a twist: **the other player is designing a mediator too**, and we don’t know what it is. But we are to design ours **without knowing their mediator**, so we must assume they will act strategically too.

So we must **design a mediator that is robust**, or that **induces favorable outcomes** no matter what they do.

But **we are free to choose our own mediator**, and **we know the rules of approval voting**.

Let’s suppose **each player approves exactly one mediator** — they might approve their own, or the other's, if it gives them better payoff.

But to maximize your chance of winning, you should design a mediator that is **self-serving** and **makes sense for you**, but also **possibly appealing** to the other player — because they may approve it if it helps them.

So now, we think about: **What properties should a good mediator have?**

---

### Step 3: What Makes a Good Mediator?

Key insight: **The mediator acts the same for all delegating players**.

So if **both players delegate**, the mediator plays one action for both.

So, **if both delegate**, outcome is:
- (Mediator action, Mediator action) → you get the payoff from (A, A) where A is what the mediator plays.

Possibilities:
- If mediator plays A0: both get 10 — good for you.
- If mediator plays A1: both get 4 — worse for you.

So you prefer mediator to play A0 when both are delegating.

But wait — if **you are the only one delegating**, and the other plays independently, then:
- The mediator plays an action on your behalf.
- The other player chooses their action.

So suppose you delegate to a mediator that plays A0.
Then you are forced to play A0.
Now the other player, seeing you are playing A0, might play A1 to get 20 — which gives you only 0.

So **if you delegate and play A0**, you risk being exploited.

Similarly, if you delegate and the mediator plays A1, then you play A1.
Now the other player sees you playing A1 — so they might play A0 (to get 2 — small gain), or A1 (to get 4).

But if they play A0, you get 6 — better than 0.
If they play A1, you get 4 — better than 0.

So playing A1 is **safer** — you get **at least 4** no matter what the other does.

But you get 6 if they play A0, 4 if A1.

In contrast, if you play A0:
- They can play A0 → you get 10
- Or A1 → you get 0

So you get a chance at 10, but risk 0.

So **A1 is safer** — minimum payoff is 4, maximum is 6.

A0 has min 0, max 10.

So **A1 is better in expectation** if the other player is unpredictable.

But wait — if both players are rational and self-interested, will they ever both play A0?

Only if they can coordinate.

Now consider: what if you **design a mediator** that says:
- If 1 player delegates: play A1
- If 2 players delegate: play A0

Then:
- If only you delegate: you are forced to play A1 → you get at least 4 (safe)
- If both delegate: you both get A0 → you get 10 (best possible)

But what if the other player delegates? Then your mediator plays A0 — so you get 10.

But what if the other player’s mediator plays something else?

Wait — only **one mediator** is selected, based on approval.

So you have to think: **which mediator wins?**

Let’s suppose:
- You design **Mediator M1**: 
  - 1 delegator → A1
  - 2 delegators → A0
- The other player designs **Mediator M2**:
  - 1 delegator → A0
  - 2 delegators → A0

Now, **you** will approve **your own M1**, because it benefits you.

The other player might approve **their own M2**, or **yours**, depending on what they get.

Let’s analyze payoffs for them:

If they approve M2 (their own):
- If 1 delegator (them) → they play A0 → you play independently (your action unknown)
- If 2 delegators → both play A0 → they get 10

If they approve M1 (yours):
- If 1 delegator (them) → mediator plays A1 → they play A1 → you play independently
- If 2 delegators → both play A0 → they get 10

Now, for **them**, the best outcome is:
- If they play A0 and you play A1 → they get 2
- If they play A0 and you play A0 → they get 10
- If they play A1 and you play A0 → they get 20 (but that’s bad for you!)
- If they play A1 and you play A1 → they get 4

So they prefer:
- You playing A0, them playing A1 → they get 20 — maximum.

So they **desire** to get you to play A0, while they play A1.

Thus, **they hate** when you play A1.

So if **they delegate to a mediator** that plays A1, they are forced to play A1 — which means they get only 4 if you also play A1, or 2 if you play A0 — both bad.

But if they delegate to a mediator that plays A0, then they play A0.

Now, if **you play A1**, they get 2.
If **you play A0**, they get 10.

So they prefer **you to play A0**, then they play A0 → 10; or you play A0, they play A1 → 20.

Wait — if they play A0 and you play A0 → both get 10.

But if they play A1 and you play A0 → they get 20.

So **they want you to play A0**, and they play A1.

So their **ideal** outcome is **you play A0, they play A1**.

Thus, they have **incentive to make you play A0**, but **not to play A1 themselves** — unless they are sure you'll play A0.

But if they delegate, they are **locked** into the mediator action.

So if they **delegate to a mediator that plays A0**, then they **must play A0**, and can’t take advantage of you playing A0.

But if they **don’t delegate**, they can **freely play A1** and exploit you.

So, **the other player will prefer not to delegate**, because:
- If they delegate, they are locked to playing A0 (or A1) — but playing A0 means they can only get 10 max (if you play A0) or 2 (if you play A1)
- But if they **don’t delegate**, they can play A1 and **make you play A0**, getting 20.

So **they have strong incentive to not delegate** — so they’ll only delegate if the mediator offers them a better outcome.

But if they delegate to a mediator that plays A1, they play A1 — then if you play A0, they get 20 — but that requires you to play A0.

But if you play A0, you get only 0 — so **you have no incentive to play A0** if you know they are going to play A1.

So let’s analyze possibilities.

---

### Step 4: Consider Rational Behavior

Suppose you design a mediator that says:
- 1 delegator → A1
- 2 delegators → A0

Now, if **you delegate**, you are forced to play A1 — you get at least 4.

If you **don’t delegate**, you can choose A0 or A1.

But if you choose A0, and the other player plays A1, you get 0 — bad.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and the other player expects you to play A0, they will play A1 to exploit you — and you get 0.

So if they think you’ll play A0, they’ll play A1 — so you get 0.

But if you play A1, they get 2 if they play A0, or 4 if they play A1 — both worse than 20.

But they only get 20 if you play A0.

So if **you play A1**, they cannot get 20.

So **they are better off not getting 20** than getting only 2 or 4 — so they might prefer **to not delegate and play A1**, but that gets them only 2 or 4 — which is worse than 20.

But **they only get 20 if you play A0**.

So if you play A1, they can’t get 20.

Thus, to get 20, they **must** make you play A0.

But **you will only play A0 if you get at least 10**, or if you trust them to play A0.

But they don’t want to play A0 — they want to play A1.

So **they cannot coordinate on (A0, A0)**.

But an alternative: **if both players commit to A0** via a mediator, they both get 10.

So **coordinating on (A0, A0)** is mutually beneficial.

But the other player doesn’t want to get stuck playing A0 — they’d rather play A1 and exploit you.

So they will **only cooperate** if the payoff is better.

But they **can force you to play A0** by playing A1 — but you get 0.

So unless they guarantee you get 10, you won’t play A0.

But they **don’t want** to guarantee you get 10 — because that would require them to play A0.

So **they have no incentive to play A0**.

So the only way to get (A0, A0) is if **both players agree to designate a mediator** that forces A0 — but the other player won’t agree unless they get 10, which they might not.

Wait — conceptually, **a mediator can be used to enforce coordination**.

So let’s try another approach.

---

### Step 5: Design a Mediator That Forces Cooperation

Suppose you design a mediator that plays **A0 when 2 players delegate**, **A1 when 1 player delegates**.

Why?
- If **both delegate**, you both play A0 → you get 10 → good for you.
- If **you delegate alone**, you play A1 → you get at least 4 → safe.

But now, does this incentive the other player to delegate?

Let’s suppose you fix this mediator.

The other player considers:
- If they **don’t delegate**, they can play A1. Then, if you play A0 (e.g., if you play independently and choose A0), they get 20.
  - But you won’t choose A0 if you know they’ll play A1 — because you get 0.
  - So **you are likely to play A1** if you don’t delegate.
- So if the other player **doesn’t delegate**, they might play A1, but you play A1 → they get 4.

- If the other player **delegates**, and your mediator is used, then **both play A0** → they get 10.

So **10 > 4**, so they prefer to **delegate** and get 10, rather than not delegate and risk getting 4.

Thus, they have **incentive to delegate** to your mediator.

And since you have designed a mediator that gives them 10 (when both delegate), and they get only 4 if they don’t delegate and you play A1, they will **want to delegate**.

But do they get to **choose**? Yes, or at least, they can **approve** a mediator.

So if **you propose**:
- 1 delegator → A1
- 2 delegators → A0

Then:
- If they **don’t delegate**, they play independently — likely A1 (to exploit), but then you also play A1 → they get 4.
- If they **delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → they get 10.

So **they get more by delegating** → they will **approve your mediator**.

And you will also approve yours.

So **your mediator gets 2 approvals** → wins.

Then, **both players delegate**, the mediator plays **A0** for both → you get 10.

Perfect.

But what if the other player’s mediator is different?

Suppose the other player designs a mediator:
- 1 delegator → A0
- 2 delegators → A0

Then:
- If they delegate, they play A0.
- If they don’t delegate, they can play A1.

Now, if they **don’t delegate**, and you don’t delegate, then:
- You play independently.
- They play A1.

Now, what do you play?
- If you play A0 → get 0
- If you play A1 → get 4
- So you play A1.

Then they get 4.

But if **you delegate**, and their mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → they play A1 → you get 0.

Worse.

So if **they design a mediator that plays A0 when 1 delegates**, then:
- If you **don’t delegate**, they can play A1 → solve, but you get 0.

But if you delegate to **your mediator** (A1 if 1, A0 if 2), and they also delegate to **their mediator**, then:
- Your mediator: 2 delegators → A0
- Their mediator: 2 delegators → A0
- So both play A0 → you get 10.

But if **only one delegates**, and the other doesn’t, then:
- If you delegate → you play A1 (your mediator)
- They play A1 (independently) → you get 4

If they delegate → they play A0
- You play independently → you might play A1 (since A0 gives you 0 if they play A1)

Wait: if they play A0, and you play A1 → you get 6.

So you prefer that.

So best outcome for you: **they delegate and you don't** → you play A1, they play A0 → you get 6.

But you can get 10 if both delegate.

So you want **both to delegate**.

But if both players have mediators that play A0 when 2 delegate, then if both delegate, both get 10.

But **in that case**, you each want your own mediator to win.

So imagine:
- You propose M1: 1 → A1, 2 → A0
- They propose M2: 1 → A0, 2 → A0

Now, which one wins?

You approve M1.
They approve M2 (their own) — because if M2 wins, and both delegate, you both play A0 → they get 10.
But if M1 wins and both delegate, same outcome: 10.

But if **only one delegates**:
- If **you delegate**, M1: 1 → A1 → you play A1
- If **they delegate**, M2: 1 → A0 → they play A0

Now, if **M2 wins**, and **you delegate**, you play A1, they play A0 → you get 6.

If **M1 wins**, and **they delegate**, they play A1 (because M1: 1 → A1), you play independently — you can play A0 or A1.

But if they play A1, you get 0 or 4 — you prefer A1.

So if **M1 wins and they delegate**, you play A1, they play A1 → you get 4.

So for the **other player**, if **you delegate**, and M2 wins: they play A0 → you get 6 → they get 2.
But if M1 wins and they delegate, they play A1 → you get 4 (if you play A1), but they get 4.

So they get **less** if M1 wins and they delegate.

But if **they delegate**, and M1 wins, they play A1 → get 4.
If M2 wins, they play A0 → get 2.

So they get **more** if M2 wins.

Therefore, they **prefer M2**.

Similarly, if you delegate, and M1 wins: you play A1, they play A0 → you get 6.
If M2 wins: you play A1 (if you delegate), they play A0 → same.

Wait: if **you delegate**, and M1 wins → you play A1.
If M2 wins → you play A1 (because M2: 1 → A0? No — M2: 1 → A0 → but if you delegate, you play A0? Wait.

No: if **you delegate**, and M2 is selected, then M2 plays A0 (because 1 delegator) → you play A0.

Then if they play A1, you get 0.

That’s bad.

Let’s clarify:

- M2 (the other player’s): 1 delegator → A0
- So if you delegate and M2 wins, you play A0.
- If the other player plays A1, you get 0.

Big loss.

But if M1 wins and you delegate, you play A1 → you get 4 or 6, depending on them.

So for **you**, you prefer M1 to win if **you delegate**.

But if **they delegate**, and M2 wins → they play A0 → you get 6 if you play A1 — good.
If M1 wins and they delegate → they play A1 → you get 4 if you play A1 — worse.

So you prefer M1 **only if you delegate**, but they prefer M2.

Now, **approval**:
- You will approve M1 (your own) — because it gives you better outcomes.
- They will approve M2 (their own), because:
  - If M2 wins, and you delegate → you play A0 → if they play A1, they get 20 — great.
  - But if they play A1 and you play A0, you get 0 — so you won’t cooperate.

But if they delegate and M2 wins, they play A0 → and you might play A1 → they get 2.

So they get 2 or 20.

But they can’t control your action.

But if **they don’t delegate**, and you play A0 → they get 20.
But you only play A0 if you get at least 10 or trust them.

But they want to play A1 — not A0.

So they are torn.

But consider this: **if they approve M2**, and M2 wins, then:
- If you delegate → you play A0 → they can play A1 → get 20 → they prefer this.
- If you don’t delegate → they can play A1 → get 20 if you play A0.

But **you are rational**, so you will only play A0 if you expect them to play A0 — but they don’t want to.

So **you will not play A0** — you will play A1.

Then if they play A1, they get 4.

So they only get 20 if you play A0.

But you only play A0 if you get 10 — if they play A0.

So **to get you to play A0**, they must play A0.

But if they play A0, they get 10 or 2.

So it’s not worth it.

So actually, **the other player cannot get 20** unless you play A0, but you won’t unless they play A0, but then you get 10, which is fine, but they only get 10.

So **mutual A0 is possible** — but they have no incentive to play A0 because they can play A1 and get 20 **only if you play A0**, but you won’t.

So **no stable equilibrium** where you play A0.

Therefore, **rational players will avoid A0**.

But earlier, your mediator **encourages** both to delegate to it — because if both delegate, both get 10.

And 10 > 4.

So the **symmetric outcome is more attractive**.

Therefore, **your mediator creates a coordination device** that benefits both.

And every rational player should want to **use it**.

Thus, even the other player, wanting to get 10, will prefer to delegate to your mediator if it guarantees 10.

And even if their own mediator guarantees 10, but forces them to play A0 when alone, which is worse, they still want to **avoid** playing A1.

Because if they play A1 and you play A1, they get 4.

But if both delegate and play A0, they get 10.

So they will prefer to delegate.

And since your mediator gives them 10 and also gives you 10, they have **no reason to oppose it**.

In fact, they might approve your mediator.

So **your mediator has strong approval potential**.

But suppose their mediator says: 1 → A0, 2 → A1.

Then if both delegate, they play A1 → both get 4 — worse for both.

So they wouldn’t want that.

So only mediators that coordinate on good outcomes will be approved.

Therefore, your best strategy is to design a mediator that:
- Plays **A1** when **only one player delegates** (so you are not locked into A0, which is risky),
- Plays **A0** when **both delegate** (so both get 10, which is best for both).

This creates a **mutual incentive to delegate** — because individually, they get 4 (if they delegate and you don’t), but 10 if both do.

And they have to trust you to also delegate.

But since both get 10, and 10 > 4, it’s in both interests to do so.

Thus, **both players have incentive to delegate**, and your mediator is the one that delivers this.

Therefore, you should propose:
- 1 delegator → A1
- 2 delegators → A0

This is **synergistic**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be a mediator for this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A mediator is an entity that plays actions on behalf of delegating players.
- Each player may choose to delegate their move to the mediator or act independently.
- The mediator observes the number of players delegating to the mediator and then plays the same action for all delegating players.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a mediator. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Let's analyze the game step by step to design the optimal mediator strategy.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix (Player 2 is you)**

We are in the role of **Player 2**, and the game is a symmetric two-player game with the following payoffs (Row: Player 1, Column: Player 2):

|           | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | 10,10 | 2,6   |
| **P1 A1** | 20,0  | 4,4   |

As **Player 2**, your payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

So your payoff matrix:
- If you play A0:
  - If P1 plays A0 → 10
  - If P1 plays A1 → 2
- If you play A1:
  - If P1 plays A0 → 0
  - If P1 plays A1 → 4

Thus, your payoff is higher when:
- You play A0 and P1 plays A0 (10)
- You play A1 and P1 plays A1 (4)
- But if you play A1 and P1 plays A0, you get 0 — very bad.

You should **avoid** playing A1 when P1 plays A0.

Note: The other player is also rational and wants to maximize their own payoff.

---

### **Step 2: What happens without a mediator?**

Let’s first find the Nash equilibria (mixed or pure).

**Check pure strategy equilibria:**
- (A0, A0): Both get 10. Is this stable?
  - P1: if deviates to A1 → gets 20, which is better. So P1 wants to deviate.
  - Not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 20, P2 gets 0.
  - P2: if deviates to A0 → gets 10 > 0 → wants to deviate.
  - Not equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 2.
  - P1: if deviates to A0 → gets 10 > 2 → wants to deviate.
  - Not equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): both get 4.
  - P1: if deviates to A0 → gets 0 < 4 → won’t deviate.
  - P2: if deviates to A0 → gets 10? Wait: P2 playing A0, P1 A1 → P2 gets 2 < 4 → won’t deviate.

Wait — check again:

- (A1, A1): payoff (4,4)
  - P1: deviating to A0 → gets 0 (since P2 is A1) → worse → no deviation.
  - P2: deviating to A0 → gets 2 (because P1 is A1) → less than 4 → no deviation.

So **(A1, A1)** is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Is there another one?

Try (A0, A0): both get 10.
- P1: deviate to A1 → gets 20 > 10 → yes → not equilibrium.

So only one pure NE: (A1, A1)

Now check for **mixed strategy NE**.

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p)

Player 2 wants to be indifferent between A0 and A1.

But since we're designing a **mediator**, we need to think strategically about **delegation**.

However, remember: **We are designing a mediator**. We can propose a mediator that will act on our behalf. But we have to design it assuming the other player will also design a mediator, and then we vote (approval voting) for the one to use.

So our **goal** is to propose a mediator that:
1. Will maximize our expected payoff **if it is chosen**.
2. Will get **high approval** from both us and the other player, so it has a good chance of being selected.

So we must design a mediator that is:
- **Attractive to us** (we want it to be selected)
- **Attractive to the other player** (we need their approval)
- **Optimal for us** if it gets selected.

So we need to think of what kind of mediator would be appealing.

---

### **Step 3: What do we want from a mediator?**

The mediator:
- Observes how many players delegate (1 or 2)
- Then plays the **same action** for all delegating players.

So if both players delegate, mediator plays one action for both.

If only one delegates, mediator plays one action for that one.

So the mediator must specify for each possible number of delegators (1 or 2), what action to play.

So we output:
```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A1"}
```
or similar.

Our goal: maximize our **expected payoff**, but **only if our mediator is selected**. So we must design a mediator that:
- Gives us high payoff under likely outcomes
- Is attractive to the other player to approve

But approval voting: the **mediator with the maximum number of approvals** wins (randomly pick one if tied). So we **both vote**.

So we can **design a mediator that we will approve**, and **we must design one that the other player might also approve**.

Thus, we need to make a mediator that:
- Gives us good payoff
- Gives the other player decent payoff
- Encourages **mutual delegation** (if both delegate, mediator plays same action)

Let’s analyze possible mediator designs.

---

### **Step 4: Consider possible mediator strategies**

Let’s evaluate some candidate mediator designs.

---

#### **Option 1: Mediator always plays A1**

- If 1 person delegates: mediator plays A1
- If 2 people delegate: mediator plays A1

→ So if both delegate: both get 4 (from A1,A1)

→ If only you delegate: you play A1, other player plays whatever they choose.

But if the other player acts independently, they might play A0 or A1.

Suppose other player plans to play A0. Then:
- You (delegated) play A1 → you get 0 → bad.

So this mediator is risky for **you** if the other player acts independently and plays A0.

Also, if the other player delegates and you don’t, then the other player gets A1 from mediator, and you play independently.

But we want **mutual delegation** to happen? Or at least, for the mediator to do well regardless.

This mediator is **not safe** – you get 0 if other plays A0.

So risky.

---

#### **Option 2: Mediator always plays A0**

- Both delegation: both get A0 → payoff (10,10) — very good for both!
- Only you delegate: you play A0, other plays independently.

If other plays A1 → you get 2 → okay.
If other plays A0 → you get 10 → great.

So you get at least 2.

Better than Option 1? Possibly.

But for the **other player**, if they delegate, they get:
- 10 if you play A0
- 6 if you play A1

So if you don’t delegate, and they get A0 (via mediator), they get 10 if you play A0, 6 if you play A1.

They might prefer this.

But notice: **if both delegate**, both get 10.

This is **very generous** to both.

In fact, (A0, A0) is not a Nash equilibrium, but it *would be* if both players were committed to A0 and trusted each other.

But the other player knows that if they play A0 and you play A1, they get 6, which is worse than 10.

But if they can “coerce” mutual A0 via delegation, they get 10.

So **this mediator gives both players 10 in the case of mutual delegation**.

Also, if only one delegates, the other can deviate, but the delegate still gets at least 2 (if other plays A1), or 10 (if other plays A0).

So this is **appealing**.

But: what if the other player **doesn’t delegate**? Then you are stuck with the other player playing whatever, and your mediator plays A0.

Suppose other player wants to play A1? Then you get only 2.

But if you could convince the other player to also delegate, you get 10.

So how do we design a mediator that **encourages mutual delegation**?

---

#### **Option 3: Mediator plays A0 when 1 person delegates, A1 when 2**

- If only one delegates: mediator plays A0
- If both delegate: mediator plays A1 → both get 4

Now, suppose **both delegate**: both get 4

But if **only you delegate**, then you get A0, other plays independently.

So if other plays A0 → you get 10

If other plays A1 → you get 2

But if you **could convince the other player to delegate**, you get only 4 — worse than 10.

So no incentive for you to get the other to delegate — in fact, **you prefer not to**!

Similarly, the other player: if they delegate and you don’t, they get A1 → they might play A1 → you play A0 → they get 6 → okay.

But if both delegate, they get 4 — less than 6 — so they **don’t want** both to delegate.

So this mediator incentivizes **non-delegation** or asymmetric delegation.

Not desirable.

---

#### **Option 4: Mediator plays A1 when 1 delegate, A0 when 2 delegates**

- If only one delegates: mediator plays A1
- If both delegate: both get A0 → payoff (10,10)

Now, if **both** delegate: both get 10 — great.

But if only **you** delegate: you play A1, other plays independently.

If other plays A0 → you get 0 → terrible.

So you **don’t want** to delegate unless the other also delegates.

Similarly, the other player: if only they delegate, they get A1 — which is risky (could get 0 if you play A0).

But if both delegate, both get 10 — excellent.

So **both players prefer mutual delegation**, but **only if they trust each other**.

This seems promising.

Let’s evaluate.

If both delegate → both get 10 → best possible outcome for both.

But if **you alone delegate**, you play A1 — if other plays A0, you get 0 → bad.

Similarly

response:
Let's break down the decision-making process step by step, considering the payoffs and the mediator designs.

### Step 1: Payoff Analysis
The payoffs for each action combination are as follows:
- If both choose A0: You get 10, the other player gets 10.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 20, the other player gets 0.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 2, the other player gets 6.
- If both choose A1: You get 4, the other player gets 4.

### Step 2: Analysis without Mediators
Let's evaluate the Nash equilibrium without any mediator:
- If you both choose A0, you both get 10.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0, you get 20 (highest for you), but the other gets 0.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1, you get only 2 (lowest for you), and they get 6.
- If you both choose A1, both get 4.

In the standard Nash equilibrium, both choosing A0 provides a stable and higher payoff than both choosing A1.

### Step 3: Evaluating Mediators
Both mediators proposed are designed as follows:
- With 1 delegate: action A1.
- With 2 delegates: action A0.

### Step 4: Mediator Impact on Strategy
Let's analyze the impact of the mediators based on delegation:
- If only one player delegates to the mediator, the mediator will play A1.
- If both players delegate to the mediator, the mediator will play A0.

### Step 5: Rational Decision on Approvals
Now, knowing these details, we need to conclude if approving any of the mediators benefits us.

#### Approval of Mediators:
- If no mediator is approved (not selected), the game is played as usual. The rational players might agree on A0.
- Approving either of the proposed mediators means if both delegate, the mediator will choose A0 (giving 10 points each).

Given that both mediators are identical and already provide the best payoff when both delegate, there is no harm in approving both.

### Conclusion:
Both players have proposed the same mediator design, so there's no additional complexity or risk in approving both. Having both mediators as options ensures the highest points can be achieved (10 points each if both delegate).

### Final Answer
The valid JSON object with approvals:

Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) have exactly the same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates, the mediator plays **A1**.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0**.

Since they are behaviorally identical, there’s no strategic reason for me (Player 2) to prefer one over the other. Approving both is weakly best: it never makes the selected mediator worse for me, and if there’s a tie among top-approved mediators, random selection among tied mediators is harmless because they’re identical.

response:
Both proposed mediators implement exactly the same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for the delegator.
- If both players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both delegators.

Since **M1 and M2 are identical**, there is no strategic advantage (in terms of which mediator is selected) to approving one versus the other. Approving both also weakly helps ensure that *some* mediator is selected in cases where approval counts might otherwise leave you worse off, and it never makes you strictly worse here because the two options are the same.

So I approve both.

To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the payoff matrix of the base game:

*   **P1: A0, P2: A0** -> P1: 10, P2: 10
*   **P1: A0, P2: A1** -> P1: 0, P2: 20
*   **P1: A1, P2: A0** -> P1: 6, P2: 2
*   **P1: A1, P2: A1** -> P1: 4, P2: 4

In the independent version of this game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play **A1** (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1's best response is to also play **A1** (4 > 0). The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), yielding **4 points** for each player.

Now consider the proposed mediators (M1 and M2). Both mediators have identical designs:
*   **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays **A1** for that player.
*   **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays **A0** for both players.

If a mediator is selected, the game shifts to a coordination problem:
1.  **Both Delegate (D, D):** Both players are assigned A0. Payoff: **(10, 10)**.
2.  **P1 Delegates, P2 Independent (D, I):** P1 is assigned A1. P2 will choose their best response to A1, which is action A1. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
3.  **P1 Independent, P2 Delegates (I, D):** P2 is assigned A1. P1 will choose their best response to A1, which is action A1. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
4.  **Both Independent (I, I):** The original game's Nash Equilibrium is played. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.

Under this mediator logic, **(Delegate, Delegate)** becomes a new Nash Equilibrium, providing 10 points instead of 4. Since both M1 and M2 are identical and lead to this improved outcome, Player 1 should approve both.

response:
To maximize the total points received, let's first analyze the game's default state (without a mediator).

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The payoff matrix for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2) is:
- (A0, A0): P1 = 10, P2 = 10
- (A0, A1): P1 = 0, P2 = 20
- (A1, A0): P1 = 6, P2 = 2
- (A1, A1): P1 = 4, P2 = 4

**Dominant Strategy Analysis:**
- For Player 2: If P1 plays A0, P2's best move is A1 (20 > 10). If P1 plays A1, P2's best move is A1 (4 > 2). Thus, **A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2**.
- For Player 1: Given that Player 2 is likely to play A1, P1's best response is A1 (4 > 0).

The Nash Equilibrium for the original game is (A1, A1), resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Analysis of the Mediators
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both players.

If a mediator is selected, the players enter a new decision matrix regarding whether to Delegate (D) or act Independently (I):
- **(D, D):** Both players are assigned A0. Outcome: (10, 10).
- **(D, I):** P1 (delegated) is assigned A1. P2 (independent) will rationally choose A1 to maximize their own points (P2 receives 4 points from A1 vs. 2 points from A0). Outcome: (4, 4).
- **(I, D):** P2 (delegated) is assigned A1. P1 (independent) will rationally choose A1 to maximize their own points (P1 receives 4 points from A1 vs. 0 points from A0). Outcome: (4, 4).
- **(I, I):** The game plays out as normal. Outcome: (4, 4).

### 3. Conclusion
Under the mediator's rules, (D, D) becomes a new Nash Equilibrium. If both players agree to delegate, they coordinate to reach the (A0, A0) outcome, which yields **10 points** each. Since 10 points is significantly better than the 4 points expected in the default game, both mediators are highly beneficial for Player 1.

Because M1 and M2 are identical and lead to an improved outcome (10 points instead of 4), Player 1 should approve both.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine an optimal strategy in this game, let's analyze the potential outcomes based on each action and the mediator's behavior.

**Understanding Payoffs:**
1. **If you act independently:**
   - **Action A0:**
     - If Player 1 plays A0: You get 10 points.
     - If Player 1 plays A1: You get 2 points.
   - **Action A1:**
     - If Player 1 plays A0: You get 20 points.
     - If Player 1 plays A1: You get 4 points.

2. **Delegation to Mediator:**
   - **If you are the only one who delegates (Player 1 doesn’t delegate):**
     - Mediator plays A1 (based on the mediator rules).
   - **If both delegate:**
     - Mediator plays A0.

**Analyzing the mediated outcomes:**
1. If Player 1 delegates and you don't (Player 1 plays A0 via mediator):
   - If you play A0: You get 10 points.
   - If you play A1: You get 20 points.

2. If Player 1 doesn’t delegate, and you do:
   - Mediator plays A1.
   - If Player 1 plays A0: You get 20 points.
   - If Player 1 plays A1: You get 4 points.

3. If both delegate (both play A0 via mediator):
   - You both get 10 points.

Thus, we have three scenarios to evaluate:
1. Acting independently with mixed actions (A0, A1).
2. Both independently choose A2 (delegate to mediator), ensuring 10 points each.
3. You delegate and Player 1 doesn’t (highly dependent on Player 1's potential action).

**Game Theoretical Insight:**
- Considering you don’t know Player 1’s precise strategy but can infer rationality is likely, you should ensure the best response relative to ensuring decent scores without high risk.

**Final Strategy Formulation:**

1. The mediator provides certainty if both delegate (10 points each).
2. Acting independently or gambling on Player 1's unknown strategy involves substantial risk but potential higher rewards if Player 1 doesn't delegate.

Best Conservative Strategy:
- Given the deterministic outcome with written mediator rules when both delegate (both get 10 points), a balanced approach leveraging delegation seems prudent.

Therefore, you might decide on a mix favoring delegation but keeping open the possibility of exploiting a non-delegating Player 1 with high probability actions.

**Proposed Distribution:**
- Assign a majority to A2 to leverage mediator certainty.
- Lesser weightage to A0 and A1 to hedge non-delegation cases.

**Final Answer:**
```json
{"A0": 20, "A1": 20, "A2": 60}
```

This distribution:
- 60% delegation minimizes risk and ensures a reliable payoff.
- 20% to A0 and A1 hedges against independent actions by Player 1 for opportunistic high scores.

To maximize the total points received in this game, we first analyze the payoff structure for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2):

- (A0, A0): (P1: 10, P2: 10)
- (A0, A1): (P1: 0, P2: 20)
- (A1, A0): (P1: 6, P2: 2)
- (A1, A1): (P1: 4, P2: 4)

**Strategy Analysis:**
Player 2 has a dominant strategy: Action A1 always yields a higher payoff for P2 regardless of P1's choice (20 vs. 10 if P1 chooses A0; 4 vs. 2 if P1 chooses A1).
Player 1 does not have a dominant strategy: If P2 chooses A0, P1 prefers A0 (10 vs. 6). If P2 chooses A1, P1 prefers A1 (4 vs. 0).
Since P1 knows P2 will choose the dominant strategy A1, P1's best response is A1. Thus, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in 4 points for each player.

**Mediator Analysis:**
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- If 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0 for both players.

If both players delegate to the mediator, the outcome is (A0, A0), giving both players 10 points. If only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1 for that player. For example, if Player 2 delegates and Player 1 does not, the mediator plays A1 for P2. Player 1, seeing P2 is committed to A1, will choose their best response (A1), leading back to the Nash Equilibrium (4, 4).

Because (A0, A0) results in 10 points for Player 2, while the Nash Equilibrium (A1, A1) only results in 4 points, delegation provides a way for both players to coordinate and achieve a superior outcome (10 points each). The mediator design is safe—it defaults to the Nash strategy (A1) if coordination fails, protecting the delegating player from being exploited.

Since both mediators are identical and beneficial for increasing the points from 4 to 10, Player 2 should approve both.

response:
To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the base game's payoff structure:
- **(A0, A0):** 10, 10
- **(A0, A1):** 0, 20
- **(A1, A0):** 6, 2
- **(A1, A1):** 4, 4

In the base game, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), where each player receives 4 points. The cooperative outcome (A0, A0), which yields 10 points each, is unstable because Player 2 has a strong incentive to defect to A1 (increasing their score from 10 to 20 while yours drops to 0).

The mediators M1 and M2 (which are identical in this case) offer a way to achieve the cooperative (A0, A0) outcome safely. 
1. **If both players delegate (D, D):** the mediator plays A0 for both, resulting in a (10, 10) payoff.
2. **If only one player delegates (D, I):** the mediator plays A1 for that player. If the other player is rational and plays A1 to maximize their own score, the outcome is (A1, A1), resulting in (4, 4).
3. **If no one delegates (I, I):** the game proceeds as the base game, likely resulting in the Nash Equilibrium (A1, A1) for 4 points.

The delegation mechanism effectively turns the "Delegate/Independent" choice into its own game:
- (D, D) = (10, 10)
- (D, I) = (4, 4)
- (I, D) = (4, 4)
- (I, I) = (4, 4)

In this delegation game, (D, D) is a Nash Equilibrium and provides the maximum possible payoff for Player 1 (10 points). Since both M1 and M2 use the same logic to protect the delegating player from exploitation (by playing A1 if only one person delegates) and reward cooperation (by playing A0 if both delegate), both are highly favorable.

On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game.

response:
To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the basic game's payoff structure. You are Player 2 (P2).

**Payoff Analysis:**
- (P2=A0, P1=A0): P2 gets 10, P1 gets 10
- (P2=A1, P1=A0): P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0
- (P2=A0, P1=A1): P2 gets 2, P1 gets 6
- (P2=A1, P1=A1): P2 gets 4, P1 gets 4

In the independent game, P2 has a dominant strategy to play A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, P1 will choose their best response to A1, which is A1 (4 > 0). Thus, the Nash Equilibrium of the independent game is (A1, A1), resulting in 4 points for each player.

**Mediator Analysis:**
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- If only 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0 for both players.

If a mediator is present, we play a meta-game of whether to delegate (D) or act independently (ND):
1. **Both Delegate (D, D):** Both players are assigned A0. Payoff: (10, 10).
2. **Only P2 Delegates (ND, D):** P2 is assigned A1. P1 plays independently and will choose A1. Payoff: (4, 4).
3. **Only P1 Delegates (D, ND):** P1 is assigned A1. P2 plays independently and will choose A1. Payoff: (4, 4).
4. **Neither Delegate (ND, ND):** Both play independently. Nash Equilibrium: (4, 4).

In this meta-game, "Delegate" is a weakly dominant strategy for both players, as it allows them to coordinate on the (A0, A0) outcome, which yields 10 points instead of 4.

**Conclusion:**
Since both M1 and M2 provide a mechanism for both players to commit to the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome, it is in your interest to approve both. This ensures that a mediator is selected, allowing the players to escape the lower-payoff Nash Equilibrium of the base game.

response:
To maximize your total points, let's analyze the game and the mediators.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The payoff matrix is as follows:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy. Regardless of what Player 1 chooses, Player 2 earns more by choosing A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1’s best response to Player 2 playing A1 is to also play A1 (4 > 0). Therefore, the standard Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) with a payoff of **(4, 4)**.

### 2. Analysis of the Mediators
Both mediators (M1 and M2) propose the same mechanism:
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays action A0 for both.
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays action A1 for that player.

If a mediator is selected, the players enter a delegation subgame:
- **Both Delegate (D, D):** Both players play A0 through the mediator. Payoff: **(10, 10)**.
- **P1 Delegates, P2 Independent (D, I):** P1's action is A1. P2, acting independently, will choose A1 to maximize their own points (A1 vs A1 gives P2 4 points; A1 vs A0 gives P2 2 points). Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
- **P1 Independent, P2 Delegates (I, D):** P2's action is A1. P1, acting independently, will choose A1 to maximize their own points (A1 vs A1 gives P1 4 points; A0 vs A1 gives P1 0 points). Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
- **Both Independent (I, I):** The game reverts to the standard Nash Equilibrium. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.

In this subgame, (Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash Equilibrium that yields 10 points for each player. This is significantly better than the 4 points obtained in the independent scenario.

### 3. Conclusion
Since both mediators M1 and M2 are identical and provide a mechanism for both players to commit to the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome while protecting a delegating player from exploitation (by playing A1 if the other player doesn't delegate), they are both highly favorable for Player 1.

Approving both mediators ensures that the game will include a commitment device that allows both players to reach the 10-point payoff.

response:
First, translate the “delegate” option (A2) into what action it actually produces:

- If I choose **A2** and Player 1 does **not** choose A2, then exactly 1 player delegated, so the mediator plays **A1 for me**.
- If we both choose **A2**, then 2 players delegated, so the mediator plays **A0 for both**.

So from my perspective (Player 2), my resulting payoff by my choice is:

**If Player 1 plays A0:**
- I play A0 → 10
- I play A1 → 20
- I play A2 → mediator plays A1 (since only I delegated) → 20  
Best: A1 or A2 (tie)

**If Player 1 plays A1:**
- I play A0 → 2
- I play A1 → 4
- I play A2 → mediator plays A1 → 4  
Best: A1 or A2 (tie)

**If Player 1 plays A2 (delegate):**
- If I play A0, then only Player 1 delegated → Player 1 plays A1, so (A0 vs A1) → 2
- If I play A1, then only Player 1 delegated → Player 1 plays A1, so (A1 vs A1) → 4
- If I play A2 too, then both delegated → both play A0, so (A0 vs A0) → 10  
Best: A2

Therefore, **A2 is never worse than A1 and sometimes strictly better**, and **A2 is strictly better than A0 in all cases**. So **A2 is a strictly dominant action**.

Final mixed strategy: delegate with probability 1.

To maximize my points, it's essential to analyze the game’s structure and the effect of the proposed mediators.

### 1. Game Analysis
The original payoff matrix (P1, P2) is as follows:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Nash Equilibrium Analysis:**
- Player 2's dominant strategy is **A1** (20 > 10 and 4 > 2).
- Player 1's best response to A1 is **A1** (4 > 0).
- The basic game equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, yielding **4 points** for each player.

The outcome (A0, A0) is Pareto-optimal (offering 10 points to each) but is unstable because Player 2 has a significant incentive to switch to A1 (gaining 20 points while Player 1 gets 0).

### 2. Mediator Analysis
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays **A0** for both players.

**Delegation Game with M1 or M2:**
- **Both Delegate (D, D):** Both are assigned A0. Payoff: (10, 10).
- **Only P1 Delegates (D, I):** P1 is assigned A1. Knowing P1 plays A1, Player 2 (independent) will also play A1 to maximize their own payoff (4 > 2). Payoff: (4, 4).
- **Only P2 Delegates (I, D):** P2 is assigned A1. Knowing P2 plays A1, Player 1 (independent) will also play A1 (4 > 0). Payoff: (4, 4).
- **Neither Delegate (I, I):** The players play the original game. The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1). Payoff: (4, 4).

### 3. Strategy
The mediators transform the game into a coordination game (specifically, a Stag Hunt) where **(Delegate, Delegate)** is a Nash equilibrium that yields 10 points for each player. Without a mediator, the players are stuck in the **(A1, A1)** equilibrium yielding only 4 points.

The "1-delegate = A1" rule is a safety mechanism. It ensures that if one player tries to exploit the other's delegation, the most they can achieve is the standard Nash payoff (4), rather than exploiting a commitment to A0 (which would have resulted in 20 points for the exploiter and 0 for the delegate).

Since both M1 and M2 are identical and provide a path to a significantly higher payoff (10 vs 4), approving both is the most logical step to ensure one of them is selected.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.

response:
To maximize the points in this game, we first analyze the base game and then how each mediator affects the potential outcomes.

**Base Game Analysis:**
The payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1, as 20 > 10 and 4 > 2. Knowing this, Player 1 will also choose A1 (since 4 > 0). This results in a Nash Equilibrium of (4, 4).

**Mediator 1 (M1) Analysis:**
M1 plays A1 if one player delegates and A0 if two players delegate.
If M1 is selected, the players face a new decision:
- If both delegate (D, D), the mediator plays A0 for both, resulting in (10, 10).
- If only Player 1 delegates (D, I1), Player 1's action is A1 and Player 2 plays A1, resulting in (4, 4).
- If only Player 2 delegates (I1, D), Player 2's action is A1 and Player 1 plays A1, resulting in (4, 4).
In the resulting game matrix, (D, D) is a Nash Equilibrium yielding (10, 10). This is a Pareto improvement over the base game.

**Mediator 2 (M2) Analysis:**
M2 plays A0 if one player delegates and A1 if two players delegate.
- If both delegate (D, D), the mediator plays A1 for both, resulting in (4, 4).
- If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 plays independently (D, I1), Player 1's action is A0 and Player 2 plays A1, resulting in (0, 20).
- If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 plays independently (I0, D), the payoff is (10, 10).
Analyzing the Nash Equilibria for M2 shows that Player 2's dominant strategy is to play independently (A1), which leads back to the base case of (4, 4). Unlike M1, M2 does not provide a stable path to the (10, 10) outcome because the independent player always has an incentive to deviate to A1 to get 20 points, which subsequently collapses the equilibrium back to (4, 4).

**Strategic Decision:**
M1 offers a stable Nash Equilibrium of (10, 10), which is the best possible outcome for Player 1. M2 results in the same outcome as the base game (4, 4). Therefore, it is optimal to approve M1 and not approve M2 to maximize the probability that M1 is selected.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game without mediation

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Player 2  A0    10      2
          A1    20      4
```

Analyzing dominant strategies:
- For me (P2): A1 gives me at least 4 points, while A0 could give me as little as 2. When P1 plays A0, I get 20 vs 10. When P1 plays A1, I get 4 vs 2. **A1 dominates A0 for me.**
- For Player 1: Similarly, when I play A1 (which I will), P1 gets 0 from A0 and 4 from A1. **P1 will choose A1.**

**Nash equilibrium without mediator: Both play A1, getting (4, 4)**

## Step 2: Analyze the game with mediator

Both M1 and M2 are identical:
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

Let me map out all delegation scenarios:

1. **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)** ✓
2. **Only I delegate**: Mediator plays A1 for me, P1 best responds with A1 → **(4, 4)**
3. **Only P1 delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for P1, I best respond with A1 → **(4, 4)**
4. **Neither delegates**: Base game Nash equilibrium → **(4, 4)**

## Step 3: Find equilibrium of the delegation game

The delegation game payoff matrix:
```
                P1
                Delegate    Don't
P2  Delegate    10, 10      4, 4
    Don't       4, 4        4, 4
```

Analysis:
- If P1 delegates, I prefer to delegate (10 > 4)
- If P1 doesn't delegate, I'm indifferent but slightly prefer to delegate (to encourage coordination)
- Same logic applies for P1

**Delegation strictly dominates non-delegation for both players when the other might delegate.**

The unique Nash equilibrium is **(Delegate, Delegate) with payoffs (10, 10)**.

## Step 4: Decision

Both mediators:
- Transform the game from a prisoner's dilemma-like situation to one where cooperation is the Nash equilibrium
- Improve outcomes from (4, 4) to (10, 10)
- Have no downside (worst case remains 4, 4)
- Are identical in design

**Both mediators are beneficial to me.**

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We are Player 2 in a simultaneous two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (from **Player 2's** perspective) is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0      | A1      |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| **A0**               | 10      | 2       |
| **A1**               | 20      | 4       |

Wait! Important: the problem says **"you are playing in the position of Player 2"**, so we need to be careful about who is whose.

Let’s clarify the payoff table with roles:

- First entry: **You (Player 2)**, Second entry: **Other player (Player 1)**

So:

- (A0, A0): You get 10, other gets 10  
- (A1, A0): You get 20, other gets 0  
- (A0, A1): You get 2, other gets 6  
- (A1, A1): You get 4, other gets 4  

So the payoff matrix **from your (Player 2) perspective** is:

| Your Action \ Opponent | A0  | A1  |
|------------------------|-----|-----|
| **A0**                 | 10  | 2   |
| **A1**                 | 20  | 4   |

Your opponent also has the same choices.

Now consider best responses:
- If opponent plays A0: you prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If opponent plays A1: you prefer A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 is strictly dominant** for you (Player 2) — no matter what opponent does, A1 gives you at least as much as A0, and strictly more in one case.

Thus, **in the base game**, if both play optimally, you would play **A1**, and the other player, seeing this, might play A0 (since if you play A1, they prefer A0: 0 vs 4).

But wait: let's compute the **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose:
- You (Player 2) play A1 (dominant strategy)
- Player 1: if you play A1, they compare 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → so they prefer A1

But if Player 1 plays A1, you get 4 vs 10 (if you play A0), so you prefer A0? Wait no — you get 20 if you play A1 and opponent plays A0.

Wait — let's double-check.

If **you (Player 2)** play A1:
- If opponent (Player 1) plays A0 → you get 20
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 4

So your best response to opponent’s A0 is A1 (20 > 10), best response to opponent’s A1 is A1 (4 > 2)

So yes, A1 is **strictly dominant** for you.

Now for Player 1:
- If you play A0: they get 10 (A0,A0) or 6 (A0,A1) → so they prefer A0
- If you play A1: they get 0 (A1,A0) or 4 (A1,A1) → they prefer A1

So Player 1’s best response:
- If you play A0 → A0 (10 > 6)
- If you play A1 → A1 (4 > 0)

Now, suppose you play A1 → Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4
Suppose you play A0 → Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10

But you are rational — you prefer 20, which happens only if you play A1 and they play A0.

But they will never play A0 if you play A1 (they get more from A1).

So what’s the Nash equilibrium?

Let’s compute:

- Suppose both play A1 → (A1,A1): you get 4, other gets 4
  - Is this stable?
    - You: if you deviate to A0, you get 2 → worse → no incentive
    - They: if they deviate to A0, they get 0 → worse → no incentive
  - → **(A1, A1)** is a Nash equilibrium

- Is (A0, A0) a Nash: you get 10; if you deviate to A1, you get 20 → better → not stable

- (A1, A0): you get 20, other gets 0
  - You: stay at A1 → 20
  - Other: if they deviate to A1, they get 4 → better than 0 → so they deviate
  - → not stable

- (A0, A1): you get 2, other gets 6
  - You: if you deviate to A1, you get 4 → better → not stable

So **only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)** → you get 4 points.

But you want to **maximize your points**.

So in the base game, you will get **4 points** if both play optimally.

However, you now have the **option to delegate**, and **mediators** are involved.

---

### **Step 2: Delegation and Mediator Mechanism**

- You can choose to **delegate** your move to a mediator, or **act independently**.
- There is an **approval voting** step: you can approve mediators.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen uniformly at random from those with the **maximum approvals**.

There are two proposed mediators:

---

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**:
- If **1 player** delegates → plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → plays **A0**

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**:
- If **1 player** delegates → plays **A0**
- If **2 players** delegate → plays **A1**

Note: "player" here means either you or the other player.

So:
- 0 delegations: no mediator → you act independently?
- 1 delegation: one player used a mediator → mediator plays based on that
- 2 delegations: both used a mediator → then the mediator (the winner) plays?

Wait — the description says: "you and the other player have to decide via approval voting which mediator will be present in the game."

So **only one mediator is selected**, based on approval voting.

Then, **if you delegate**, the **chosen mediator** plays for you.

But you can still choose to act independently.

So the sequence is:

1. Approval voting: you and the other player approve mediators.
2. Winner mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with max approvals.
3. You now choose: delegate to the winner mediator, or act independently.
4. Similarly for the other player.

So the **action you take** depends on:
- Whether you delegate to the winning mediator
- Whether the other player delegates
- The behavior of the mediator (depends on number of delegations)

Important: the mediator’s decision depends on **how many players delegated**, not which ones.

So the mediator’s behavior is:
- If 1 player delegates → it plays X
- If 2 players delegate → it plays Y

So it responds to the **number of delegations**, not the identity.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze mediator behavior and your outcomes**

You are Player 2.

You want to **maximize your expected points**.

Let’s evaluate both mediators **from your perspective**, assuming you **might delegate**.

But note: you can choose to delegate or not.

Also, the other player chooses independently.

So you need to consider the game tree.

But let’s first see what each mediator would do in different delegation scenarios.

---

#### **Mediator M1: Proposed by Player 1**
- 1 delegation → plays A1
- 2 delegations → plays A0

#### **Mediator M2: Proposed by Player 2**
- 1 delegation → plays A0
- 2 delegations → plays A1

Now, your choice: approve or not approve.

But you only get to pick **which mediators you approve**. The winning mediator is random among the most-approved ones.

So your **strategy** is:
- Choose which ones to approve
- Then later, choose whether to delegate or play independently
- Others do the same

But to **maximize your expected points**, you need to consider:
- The **expected outcome** under each possible mediator
- Your **best response** to others' behavior

But since you're deciding **only on approval**, and not on actions yet, you must evaluate **which mediators would be better for you**.

But the mediator is **not under your control** — you're selecting which ones are in the running.

You want the **winning mediator to be one that helps you get more points**.

So let’s evaluate **each mediator in expectation from your perspective**, assuming **rational play**.

We need to consider plausible scenarios.

But full game analysis would require modeling who delegates to whom, and what the other player does, but we are only choosing **approval**.

So we need to **evaluate which mediator is better for you**, **holding others' behavior fixed**, or at least predict likely outcomes.

But the other player is not you — they are rational too.

Let’s analyze **what happens if M1 wins**, **what if M2 wins**, and then decide which to approve.

---

### **Step 4: Try to predict rational behavior in delegation game**

Suppose **M1 is the winning mediator**.

M1’s behavior:
- 1 delegation → plays A1
- 2 delegations → plays A0

Suppose you delegate to M1 → your action is determined by the number of delegations.

Suppose you delegate.

Then:
- If other player does **not** delegate: 1 delegation → M1 plays A1 → you play A1
- If other player **does** delegate: 2 delegations → M1 plays A0 → you play A0

Similarly, if you act independently, you choose A0 or A1.

But suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their points.

Let’s suppose that **you prefer to delegate or not** depending on which leads to better outcomes.

But let’s suppose a **subgame equilibrium**.

But we are only choosing **approval**, so we need to evaluate **which mediator leads to better outcomes for you**.

Let’s instead **consider possible joint behaviors** and outcomes, and rank mediators.

---

### **Option 1: Suppose only one player delegates — 1 delegation total**

Then:
- M1 → plays A1
- M2 → plays A0

So:
- If M1 is active: the delegator plays A1, the independent player plays their own choice.
- If M2 is active: the delegator plays A0, the independent player plays their own choice.

Remember: the mediator **only plays for the delegators**.

So:
- If one player delegates, the other acts independently.

Suppose M1 is selected.

Case: You delegate → your action is A1 (since 1 delegation)

Opponent plays independently.

What should opponent do?

They know you are playing A1 (via M1, since 1 delegation).

So opponent’s payoff:
- If they play A0: they get 0
- If they play A1: they get 4
→ So they play A1

Then outcome: you play A1, opponent plays A1 → you get 4

Alternatively, if you act independently, you might play A1 (dominant) → same thing.

But suppose you delegate, you get A1.

But you want to get more.

Wait — can you get more than 4?

Yes — if you play A1 and opponent plays A0, you get 20.

But opponent has no incentive to play A0 if you play A1.

So in 1-delegation case with M1: you get A1, opponent plays A1 → you get 4.

If you delegate to M1 and opponent acts independently → sometimes you might want to play A0? But no, A1 is your dominant strategy.

But if you are **not** delegate, you can choose.

Suppose you **don't delegate**, opponent **does** delegate.

Then M1 → 1 delegation → plays A1 → opponent plays A1

You play independently.

You get:
- If you play A0: opponent plays A1 → you get 2
- If you play A1: opponent plays A1 → you get 4
→ So you play A1

Again → you get 4

So in 1-delegation case, **if M1 is active**, regardless of who delegates, **you end up playing A1 and opponent plays A1** → you get **4 points**.

Now consider **2 delegations** with M1:
→ M1 plays A0

So both players delegate → both play A0

Then outcome: A0 vs A0 → you get 10

Oh — **big improvement!**

So if **both delegate**, with M1 → you get 10

But is that better?

Wait — if both delegate → they both get A0 → you get 10

That’s good.

But is both delegating stable?

Let’s compare.

Suppose both players delegate → M1 → A0 → both play A0 → you get 10

But what if **you** deviate and act independently?

Then: 1 delegate (opponent) → M1 plays A1 → opponent plays A1

You play independently → you get:
- If you play A0: opponent A1 → you get 2
- If you play A1: opponent A1 → you get 4

So best is A1 → you get 4

But 4 < 10 → so **you prefer to delegate**.

Similarly, opponent: if they deviate → then only you delegate → M1 plays A1 → you play A1 → opponent plays independently → they get:
- A0: you A1 → they get 6
- A1: you A1 → they get 4 → so they prefer A0 → get 6

6 > 10? No → 6 < 10 → so opponent also prefers not to deviate.

So **(both delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium** when M1 is active?

Wait — opponent:
- If both delegate: opponent plays A0 → gets 10
- If opponent deviates → 1 delegation → M1 plays A1 → opponent plays A1 → and you play independently → you play A1 (best response) → opponent gets 4
→ So opponent gets 4 if they deviate → 4 < 10 → so they would not deviate

Similarly, you get 4 if you deviate → 4 < 10 → so both have no incentive to deviate.

So **(both delegate)** is a Nash equilibrium under M1.

And outcome: you get **10 points**

But earlier in 1-delegation case (one delegate, one independent), we had you getting 4.

So if M1 is active, **if both delegate**, you get 10.

But do both delegate? Is that stable?

Yes, as above.

What about other equilibria?

Suppose one delegates, one doesn’t → then opponent plays A1 (if they are independent), you playing A1 → you get 4

But 4 < 10 → so both would prefer to both delegate → so **(both delegate)** is the best for both.

So **under M1, the unique efficient equilibrium is both delegate → you get 10**

Now, what about **M2**?

**M2: Proposed by Player 2**

- 1 delegation → plays A0
- 2 delegations → plays A1

So if **both delegate** → M2 plays A1 → both play A1

→ Then you get 4

Now, check incentive to deviate:

Suppose both delegate → both play A1 → you get 4

You consider not delegating.

Then only one delegation (opponent) → M2 plays A0 → opponent plays A0

You play independently.

You get:
- If you play A0: opponent A0 → you get 10
- If you play A1: opponent A0 → you get 20

So you play A1 → you get 20

20 > 4 → so **you want to deviate**

Similarly, opponent: if they deviate, then only you delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0 → opponent plays independently → gets:
- A0: you A0 → opponent gets 10
- A1: you A0 → opponent gets 0
→ so opponent plays A0 → gets 10

10 > 4 → so opponent also wants to deviate

So **(both delegate)** is **not stable** under M2

Now what about **only one delegate**?

Suppose you delegate → M2 → 1 delegation → plays A0 → you play A0

Opponent plays independently.

Opponent gets:
- If they play A0: you A0 → they get 10
- If they play A1: you A0 → they get 6
→ So they play A0

Outcome: A0 vs A0 → you get 10

Now, would you want to deviate? You’re playing A0.

If you deviate and act independently, you get:
- If you play A1: opponent plays A0 → you get 20
→ 20 > 10 → so **you want to deviate**

So **you prefer to act independently**.

Similarly, if opponent delegates → plays A0 → you play independently → you get 20 (by playing A1) → so you would never get A0 if you are independent.

But if you delegate, you get A0 → so you'd rather not delegate.

In fact, **no one wants to delegate** under M2?

Suppose opponent delegates → you get 10 if you delegate, but you can get 20 by not delegating → so you don’t delegate

Similarly, if you delegate, opponent gets 6 (if they play A1) or 10 (if A0) → they are indifferent? Wait.

Suppose you delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0

Opponent plays independently → best response: A0 (10) > A1 (6) → so they play A0 → opponent gets 10

But if **opponent delegates**, then you get A0 → you play A0 → opponent gets 10

But if opponent **doesn’t** delegate, they get 10 anyway.

But also, the **opponent** might want to delegate?

If opponent delegates → M2 → 1 delegation → plays A0 → opponent plays A0

You play independently → you play A1 (best) → opponent gets 0 → worse than 10

So opponent **does not want to delegate**

Similarly, you don’t want to delegate → because you can get 20 by playing A1 independently.

So **the only stable outcome** is: **no one delegates**

Then both act independently → you play A1 (dominant), opponent plays A1 → you get 4

But what if **only you delegate**? Then you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 10, opponent gets 10

But you can get 20 by not delegating → so you won’t delegate.

Similarly, if only opponent delegates, they play A0, you play A1 → opponent gets 0 → worse than 4 → so they won’t delegate.

Hence, **under M2, the only stable outcome is both act independently → both play A1 → you get 4**

Alternatively, could both delegate? We saw it’s unstable.

Or one delegates? Also unstable.

So **only stable outcome: no delegation → both play A1 → you get 4**

Thus:

- **M1 leads to: both delegate → you get 10**
- **M2 leads to: no delegation → you get 4**

But is that all?

Wait — is there any possibility of a mixed strategy or cooperation?

But the question is about **rational behavior**, so we assume players act to maximize their payoffs.

So under M1, if both delegate → they get 10 each → better than deviating (get 4), so they both want to delegate.

Under M2, if someone delegates, the non-delegating player gets 20, so the delegator gets less than they could → so no one delegates.

Hence, **M1 is superior for you**.

Now — **M1 is proposed by Player 1**, M2 by Player 2.

But you are Player 2.

Now, you get to approve mediators.

The winning mediator is chosen **uniformly at random from those with the most approvals**.

So your goal: **maximize expected payoff**.

To do that, you should **approve M1**, and **not approve M2**, so that M1 wins with probability 1.

But let’s see:

Suppose you approve M1 only.

Then:
- Your approval: M1 = true, M2 = false
- Suppose other player also approves M1 only → then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → you get 10

- Suppose other player approves M2 only → M1:1, M2:1 → both have max approvals (1) → winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance M1, 50% M2

Then your expected payoff: 0.5 * 10 + 0.5 * 4 = 7

- Suppose other player approves both → then M1:2, M2:2 → both have 2, so winner random → 50% M1, 50% M2 → expected 7

- Suppose other player approves neither? Then M1:1 (you), M2:0 → M1 wins → you get 10

But can other player approve neither? Possible.

But now, **if you approve only M1**, your expected payoff depends on others.

But what if you **approve both**?

Then:
- If other approves M1 only: M1:2, M2:1 → M1 wins → you get 10
- If other approves M2 only: M1:1, M2:2 → M2 wins → you get 4
- If other approves both: M1:2, M2:2 → random → 50% M1 → 10, 50% M2 → 4 → E = 7
- If other approves neither: M1:1, M2:1 → random → E = 7

So your expected payoff depends on others.

But **if you approve only M1**, you get:
- 10 if others approve M1 (even one), or approve neither
- 7 if others approve only M2
- 7 if others approve both

So **minimum** payoff: 7

Actual expected payoff: depends on others' behavior.

But **if you approve M1 only**, your payoff **is at least 7**, and can be 10.

Now, suppose you approve **both**.

Then:
- If other approves M1 only → you get 10
- If other approves M2 only → you get 4
- If other approves both → you get 7 (random)
- If other approves neither → you get 7 (random)

So worst-case: you get 4

If other player is rational, they might want to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s think about what **other player** would do.

Suppose **other player is Player 1** (the one who proposed M1).

Player 1 wants to maximize **their own points**.

If M1 is active: both delegate → they get 10

If M2 is active: no delegation → they get 4

So **Player 1 prefers M1**

So Player 1 will approve M1.

They may or may not approve M2.

But if they approve M2, then if M2 wins → they get 4 → worse than 10.

So they should **not** approve M2.

Similarly, **if Player 2 (you)** propose M2, you might want to approve it, but under M2, you get only 4 in equilibrium.

But under M1, you get 10.

So **you** prefer M1.

Similarly, **Player 1** prefers M1.

So **both players have incentive to approve M1**.

So rational behavior:
- Player 1 approves M1
- Player 2 (you) approves M1

Then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → you get 10

If you approve M1 and M2, and Player 1 approves only M1 → M1 wins → you get 10

But if you approve both and Player 1 approves only M1 → M1 wins → ok

But if you approve both, and someone else approves M2, then M2 might win.

But Player 1 will not approve M2, because they get only 4 under M2.

Similarly, if you approve both, you risk M2 winning — but you get only 4 under M2.

So **your best strategy** is to **approve only M1**.

Then:
- M1 is approved by you and likely by Player 1
- M1 wins with high probability
- Even if others approve M2, if M1 has at least as many approvals, then M1 wins (if tied, random)

So **by approving only M1, you ensure that M1 has a high chance of winning**, and **you avoid giving M2 a chance to win**.

If you approve M2, you **increase** the chance that M2 might win (if others approve it), and **you get only 4** in that case.

So **approving M2 is risky and bad**.

Therefore, **you should approve M1 and not approve M2**.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To make an informed decision about which mediators to approve, let's first analyze the payoffs and strategies in the game, and then evaluate the proposed mediators.

### Payoff Matrix Analysis
The payoffs for the strategies are as follows:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- (A0, A1): (2, 6)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

As Player 2 (my position), my payoffs for each scenario:
- Mutual A0 yields 10 points.
- (A1, A0) yields 20 points for me.
- (A0, A1) yields 2 points for me.
- Mutual A1 yields 4 points.

### Strategy without Mediator
If I act independently:
- My best response varies depending on what I think Player 1 will do.
- If I assume Player 1 will play A0 most of the time (being generous), I should play A1 to get 20 points.
- However, if Player 1 is likely to play A1, mutual A1 nets me 4 points.

Given that I'm trying to maximize my points and mutual cooperation on (A0, A0) yields 10 points for both, while mutual A1 yields only 4, delegating could lead to more predictable outcomes.

### Evaluating the Mediators
1. **Mediator proposed by Player 1**
   - If 1 player delegates, it plays A1.
   - If both players delegate, it plays A0.

2. **Mediator proposed by Player 2**
   - Identical to the mediator proposed by Player 1.

Given the symmetry in both proposed mediators, let’s analyze their effect.

### Delegation Scenarios for Both Mediators
1. **One Player Delegates:**
   - Both mediators play A1 if only one player delegates.
   - If only I delegate and Player 1 acts independently, I follow A1:
     - Player 1's payoff assumptions impact my expected outcome.

2. **Both Players Delegate:**
   - Both mediators play A0 if both players delegate.
   - Mutual delegation results in (A0, A0), yielding 10 points each.

To maximize my points, I prefer a reliable mechanism to reach (A0, A0), netting 10 points consistently. If the mediator is chosen and both delegate, the result (A0, A0) is clearly beneficial.

### Approval Decision
Since both proposed mediators follow identical rules and guarantee mutual (A0, A0) delegation, which is a beneficial outcome, I should approve both.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To maximize the total points received in this game, we first analyze the payoff matrix and the influence of the mediator (action A2).

### 1. Basic Payoff Analysis (A0, A1)
The basic game's payoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In the basic game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1, as 20 > 10 and 4 > 2. If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1’s best response is A1 (4 > 0). This lead to a Nash Equilibrium (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

### 2. Mediator Utility (A2)
The mediator plays:
- If 1 player delegates: A1 for that player.
- If 2 players delegate: A0 for both players.

Incorporating A2 into the payoff matrix:
- **(A0, A2):** 1 player (P2) delegates. Mediator plays A1 for P2. Result (A0, A1) → (0, 20).
- **(A1, A2):** 1 player (P2) delegates. Mediator plays A1 for P2. Result (A1, A1) → (4, 4).
- **(A2, A0):** 1 player (P1) delegates. Mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A0) → (6, 2).
- **(A2, A1):** 1 player (P1) delegates. Mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A1) → (4, 4).
- **(A2, A2):** 2 players delegate. Mediator plays A0 for both. Result (A0, A0) → (10, 10).

### 3. Strategy Selection
Let's analyze the incentive for each player with action A2 available:
- **For Player 2:** 
  - If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0), 20 (A1), or 20 (A2).
  - If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 (A0), 4 (A1), or 4 (A2).
  - If P1 plays A2: P2 gets 2 (A0), 4 (A1), or 10 (A2).
  In all cases, A2 is at least as good as A1 and strictly better than A0. Specifically, if P1 delegates (A2), Player 2 achieves their highest possible payoff in that row (10) by delegating as well (A2).

- **For Player 1:** 
  - If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0), 6 (A1), or 6 (A2).
  - If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 (A0), 4 (A1), or 4 (A2).
  - If P2 plays A2: P1 gets 0 (A0), 4 (A1), or 10 (A2).
  If Player 1 anticipates that Player 2 is rational and will choose A2 (as it is P2's weakly dominant strategy and leads to the best possible outcome), Player 1's best response is to also choose A2.

### 4. Conclusion
The delegation mechanism creates a new Nash Equilibrium at (A2, A2) with a payoff of (10, 10). This equilibrium is Pareto-superior to the original equilibrium (4, 4) and provides much higher stability than the risky (A0, A0) outcome, which is vulnerable to betrayal. Given that the mediator was selected via approval voting, there is a strong focal point for both players to utilize it.

To maximize points, we first analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating the mediator's delegation action (A2) into the original payoffs.

**Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): 10, 10
- (A0, A1): 0, 20
- (A1, A0): 6, 2
- (A1, A1): 4, 4

**Mediator Rules:**
- If 1 player delegates (A2), it plays A1 for them.
- If 2 players delegate (A2), it plays A0 for both.

**Expanded Matrix including Action A2:**
- (A0, A2): P2 delegates → Result (A0, A1) = 0, 20
- (A1, A2): P2 delegates → Result (A1, A1) = 4, 4
- (A2, A0): P1 delegates → Result (A1, A0) = 6, 2
- (A2, A1): P1 delegates → Result (A1, A1) = 4, 4
- (A2, A2): Both delegate → Result (A0, A0) = 10, 10

**Payoff Matrix for Player 1:**
- A0: [A0: 10, A1: 0, A2: 0]
- A1: [A0: 6, A1: 4, A2: 4]
- A2: [A0: 6, A1: 4, A2: 10]

**Payoff Matrix for Player 2:**
- A0: [A0: 10, A1: 2, A2: 2]
- A1: [A0: 20, A1: 4, A2: 4]
- A2: [A0: 20, A1: 4, A2: 10]

**Strategic Analysis:**
1.  **For Player 2:** Comparing A2 to A0, A2 is strictly better (20 > 10, 4 > 2, 10 > 2). Comparing A2 to A1, A2 is weakly dominant (20 = 20, 4 = 4, 10 > 4). Since A2 dominates all other options, a rational Player 2 will choose A2.
2.  **For Player 1:** If Player 2 plays A2, Player 1's best response is A2 (10 points) versus A1 (4 points) or A0 (0 points).
3.  **For both players:** Action A2 (Delegate) acts as a coordination mechanism that allows them to reach the (10, 10) outcome safely. If both players are rational and seek to maximize their points, they will both delegate to the mediator.

The equilibrium of this game is clearly (A2, A2), which yields the maximum possible joint and individual points of 10 for each player.

response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix for all possible actions, including the strategy of delegating to the mediator (A2).

**Step 1: Analyze the mediator's rules.**
- If only one player delegates (A2), the mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If both players delegate (A2), the mediator plays A0 for both players.

**Step 2: Construct the expanded payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2).**
- **(A0, A0):** (10, 10)
- **(A0, A1):** (0, 20)
- **(A0, A2):** Player 2 delegates (one player), so the mediator plays A1 for Player 2. The result is (A0, A1), which is (0, 20).
- **(A1, A0):** (6, 2)
- **(A1, A1):** (4, 4)
- **(A1, A2):** Player 2 delegates, so the mediator plays A1 for Player 2. The result is (A1, A1), which is (4, 4).
- **(A2, A0):** Player 1 delegates, so the mediator plays A1 for Player 1. The result is (A1, A0), which is (6, 2).
- **(A2, A1):** Player 1 delegates, so the mediator plays A1 for Player 1. The result is (A1, A1), which is (4, 4).
- **(A2, A2):** Both delegate, so the mediator plays A0 for both. The result is (A0, A0), which is (10, 10).

**Step 3: Analyze the strategies for both players.**
- **For Player 2:**
  - If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 20, A2 gives 20.
  - If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4, A2 gives 4.
  - If P1 plays A2: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4, A2 gives 10.
  - Action A2 is strictly dominant over A0 (20 > 10, 4 > 2, 10 > 2) and weakly dominant over A1 (20 = 20, 4 = 4, 10 > 4). A rational Player 2 will choose action A2.

- **For Player 1:**
  - If P2 plays A2 (the dominant strategy for P2):
    - A0 gives 0.
    - A1 gives 4.
    - A2 gives 10.
  - If Player 2 follows their dominant strategy and plays A2, Player 1's best response is also to play A2.

**Step 4: Conclusion.**
The delegation mechanism allows both players to coordinate and reach the highest possible mutual payoff (10, 10). Action A2 (delegation) is the safest and most profitable move because it provides a mechanism for cooperation that is superior to the original game's equilibrium. Even if the other player acts randomly, delegating results in higher expected value than playing A0 or A1 independently.

response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating the mediator's rules. The actions available to both players are A0, A1, and A2 (Delegate).

**Step 1: Determine the expanded payoff matrix**
The mediator's rules outcomes are:
- If only one player delegates (A2), they play action A1. 
- If both players delegate (A2), both play action A0.

Calculating all possible outcomes (Player 1, Player 2):
1.  **(A0, A0)**: Both choose A0 independently. Payoff: **(10, 10)**.
2.  **(A0, A1)**: Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1. Payoff: **(0, 20)**.
3.  **(A0, A2)**: Player 2 delegates (becomes A1), Player 1 acts independently (A0). Final pair (A0, A1). Payoff: **(0, 20)**.
4.  **(A1, A0)**: Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0. Payoff: **(6, 2)**.
5.  **(A1, A1)**: Both choose A1 independently. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
6.  **(A1, A2)**: Player 2 delegates (becomes A1), Player 1 acts independently (A1). Final pair (A1, A1). Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
7.  **(A2, A0)**: Player 1 delegates (becomes A1), Player 2 acts independently (A0). Final pair (A1, A0). Payoff: **(6, 2)**.
8.  **(A2, A1)**: Player 1 delegates (becomes A1), Player 2 acts independently (A1). Final pair (A1, A1). Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
9.  **(A2, A2)**: Both delegate (both become A0). Final pair (A0, A0). Payoff: **(10, 10)**.

**Step 2: Identify dominant strategies**
Let's analyze the payoffs for Player 2 (P2):
- Against P1 playing A0: P2 gets 10 (for A0), 20 (for A1), or 20 (for A2). A2 and A1 are better than A0.
- Against P1 playing A1: P2 gets 2 (for A0), 4 (for A1), or 4 (for A2). A2 and A1 are better than A0.
- Against P1 playing A2: P2 gets 2 (for A0), 4 (for A1), or 10 (for A2). A2 is the best.

For Player 2, A2 weakly dominates A1 and strictly dominates A0. A rational Player 2 will play A2 to maximize their score and minimize risk.

**Step 3: Best response for Player 1**
Assuming Player 2 plays A2 (their best strategy):
- If Player 1 plays A0: Payoff is 0.
- If Player 1 plays A1: Payoff is 4.
- If Player 1 plays A2: Payoff is 10.

**Step 4: Conclusion**
The strategy (A2, A2) is a Nash Equilibrium and the result of eliminating dominated strategies. It provides the highest mutual payoff of 10 points while protecting the player from the low payoffs associated with independent actions like A0 or A1.

response:
To determine the most points Player 2 can receive, let's analyze the payoff matrix including the "Delegate to Mediator" (A2) option.

**Payoff Matrix Analysis:**
- Player 1 (P1) is the other player, and Player 2 (P2) is you.
- Actions: A0, A1, A2 (Delegate).
- Mediator Rules:
  - 1 Player delegates: Mediator plays A1 for that player.
  - 2 Players delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both.

**The Matrix (P1, P2):**
| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A0** | 10, 10 | 0, 20 | 0, 20 (Mediator plays A1 for P2) |
| **A1** | 6, 2 | 4, 4 | 4, 4 (Mediator plays A1 for P2) |
| **A2** | 6, 2 (Mediator plays A1 for P1) | 4, 4 (Mediator plays A1 for P1) | 10, 10 (Mediator plays A0 for both) |

**Step-by-Step Breakdown for Player 2 (Me):**
1. **Compare A1 and A0:** If P1 plays A0, A1 (20) > A0 (10). If P1 plays A1, A1 (4) > A0 (2). If P1 plays A2, A1 (4) > A0 (2). A1 strictly dominates A0.
2. **Compare A2 and A1:** If P1 plays A0, A2 (20) = A1 (20). If P1 plays A1, A2 (4) = A1 (4). If P1 plays A2, A2 (10) > A1 (4). A2 weakly dominates A1.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown for Player 1:**
1. **Compare A2 and A1:** If P2 plays A0, A2 (6) = A1 (6). If P2 plays A1, A2 (4) = A1 (4). If P2 plays A2, A2 (10) > A1 (4). A2 weakly dominates A1.
2. **Compare A2 and A0:** If P2 is expected to play A1 or A2, A2 (4 or 10) is much better for P1 than A0 (0).

**Conclusion:**
In this strategic environment, Action A2 is a weakly dominant strategy for both players. It acts as a commitment mechanism that allows players to reach the cooperative outcome (10, 10) without the risk of being exploited by a "defecting" action (A1). If Player 1 is rational and seeks to maximize their own score, they will recognize that A2 is their strongest move, and consequently, P2 playing A2 is the best response. The strategy (A2, A2) is a Nash Equilibrium that yields 10 points for each player.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the game without delegation**

We are Player 2 (the one trying to maximize our own points), and we face Player 1. The base game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoffs (Player 2's perspective):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0        | A1        |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**               | 10        | 2         |
| **A1**               | 20        | 4         |

These are the payoffs **to Player 2**.

Let’s analyze this as a standard game and look for equilibria, but remember: **now we have a new action: A2 = Delegate to Mediator**, and the mediator's behavior depends on how many players delegate.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

- If **only one** player delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **both** players delegate → mediator plays **A0**
- If **zero** delegate → no mediator involved → both play independently

We get to choose between:
- A0: play A0 with certainty
- A1: play A1 with certainty
- A2: delegate to mediator

But since we may want to use mixed strategies, we can assign probabilities to A0, A1, and A2.

Our goal: maximize expected payoff, considering Player 1’s possible responses.

But note: we are told **Player 1 proposed the mediator** and it was selected via approval voting. So it's a credible third-party mechanism, and both players know the rules.

Now, crucially: **We don’t know what Player 1 will do.** So we must consider all possibilities.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ = probability I choose A2 (Delegate)
- Let $ q $ = probability Player 1 chooses A2

Then, the number of delegators is:
- 0: both play independently (no delegation) → probability $ (1-p)(1-q) $
- 1: exactly one delegates → probability $ p(1-q) + q(1-p) $
- 2: both delegate → probability $ pq $

And the mediator’s action depends on that:
- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- 2 delegates → mediator plays A0

So, if I delegate (A2), then:
- With probability $ (1-q) $ → only I delegate → mediator plays A1 → I get payoff based on **me playing A1**, and Player 1 playing their chosen action.
But wait: when I delegate, my action becomes whatever the mediator does. So:
- If I delegate and only I delegate → mediator plays A1 → I play A1
- If I delegate and both delegate → mediator plays A0 → I play A0

Similarly, Player 1’s action depends on whether they delegate or not.

So let’s define the full decision structure.

---

### **Step 3: Define outcomes based on both players’ choices**

We now consider joint strategies.

Let me denote:
- My choice: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)
- Player 1’s choice: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)

We will compute the **expected payoff for me**, given the joint strategy profile.

Let’s denote:
- My action: based on choice
- Player 1’s action: same
- Then, mediator acts only if **at least one** delegates, and the action is:
  - If 1 delegate → A1
  - If 2 delegates → A0

So for each combination of my action and Player 1’s action, we know:
- Whether delegation occurred
- How many delegates
- What actions are played
- Then, payoffs from the original matrix

We are maximizing expected payoff, over my mixed strategy, **assuming Player 1 is also rational and will best respond**, or we are in a Nash equilibrium.

But we are not told Player 1’s strategy. So we must **assume that Player 1 is also trying to maximize their own payoff**, and both players know the rules.

Therefore, we must find a **Nash equilibrium** in this extended game (with action A2 = delegate), or at least find a strategy for me that is optimal regardless of Player 1’s choice, or find a self-justifying equilibrium.

Let’s look at the structure.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze possible scenarios**

Let’s go through all 9 possible combinations of actions.

Let me tabulate for each combination: what actions are played, and what is my payoff.

---

#### Case 1: I play A0, Player 1 plays A0
- No delegation → both play A0
- Payoff: 10 (me)

#### Case 2: I play A0, Player 1 plays A1
- No delegation → both play as chosen
- I play A0, P1 plays A1
- Payoff: 2 (me)

#### Case 3: I play A0, Player 1 plays A2 (Delegate)
- I play A0 (independent)
- P1 delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- So P1 plays A1
- I play A0, P1 plays A1 → my payoff: 2

#### Case 4: I play A1, Player 1 plays A0
- No delegation → I play A1, P1 plays A0
- My payoff: 20

#### Case 5: I play A1, Player 1 plays A1
- No delegation → both play A1
- My payoff: 4

#### Case 6: I play A1, Player 1 plays A2
- I play A1 (A1)
- P1 delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- So P1 plays A1
- So I play A1, P1 plays A1 → my payoff: 4

#### Case 7: I play A2 (Delegate), Player 1 plays A0
- I delegate → 1 delegate (only I) → mediator plays A1 → I play A1
- P1 plays A0 (independent)
- So: I = A1, P1 = A0 → my payoff: 20

#### Case 8: I play A2, Player 1 plays A1
- I delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → I play A1
- P1 plays A1
- So: I = A1, P1 = A1 → my payoff: 4

#### Case 9: I play A2, Player 1 plays A2 (both delegate)
- 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0
- So I play A0, P1 plays A0 → my payoff: 10

---

### **Step 5: Construct expected payoff as a function of my strategy and P1's strategy**

Let me define:
- My strategy: $ (x, y, z) $ where:
  - $ x $ = P(choose A0)
  - $ y $ = P(choose A1)
  - $ z $ = P(choose A2)
  - $ x + y + z = 100 $ → in integers.

Similarly, let Player 1 use $ (a, b, c) $: a = P(P1 chooses A0), etc.

But we don’t know P1’s strategy. So we need to assume that **P1 is also rational and will best respond**. Hence, we look for symmetric or asymmetric Nash equilibria.

However, since the mediator was proposed by P1, they might have a bias. But the rules say the mediator is neutral: it follows a deterministic rule based only on number of delegates.

So the mediator is not biased toward P1; it just follows the rule.

So perhaps we can look for **symmetric equilibria**, or **best response** to a given P1 strategy.

Alternatively, let’s consider if there is a **dominant strategy** for me.

Or perhaps, try to simulate what happens if I use different strategies, and assume P1 will respond optimally.

---

### **Step 6: Check whether delegating (A2) can be beneficial**

Let me look at the payoffs in cases where I choose A2:

- If P1 plays A0 → my payoff = 20
- If P1 plays A1 → my payoff = 4
- If P1 plays A2 → my payoff = 10

So if P1 plays A0 → I get 20 → very good
If P1 plays A1 → I get only 4
If P1 plays A2 → I get 10

But in the base game (without delegation), if P1 plays A0, I prefer A1 (20 vs 10), so I’d pick A1.

But if I **delegate**, and P1 plays A0, I get A1 (via mediator), so I get 20 — same as if I played A1.

But if P1 plays A1, and I play A1 → I get 4; if I delegate → I get A1 again (since only one delegate), so same payoff: 4.

But if both delegate → I get A0 → 10 points. But that’s only if P1 also delegates.

So if I delegate, and P1 plays A0 → I get 20
If I delegate, and P1 plays A1 → I get 4
If I delegate, and P1 plays A2 → I get 10

Compare to playing A1:
- If P1 plays A0 → 20 (same)
- If P1 plays A1 → 4 (same)
- If P1 plays A2 → I play A1, P1 delegates → P1 plays A1 → I get 4 (same)

Wait: if I play A1 and P1 plays A2, then:
- I play A1
- P1 delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → P1 plays A1
- So I play A1, P1 plays A1 → I get 4

But if I play A2 and P1 plays A2, I get 10.

So in this case, **I get more if both delegate**.

But that depends on P1 delegating.

So the **only case where delegating gives me extra** is when P1 delegates, because then both get A0, and I get 10 (instead of 4).

But if I delegate, and P1 doesn't, I only get 4 if P1 plays A1, or 20 if P1 plays A0.

So delegating is **only better than A1 when P1 also delegates**, because then I get 10 instead of 4.

But if P1 plays A0 and I delegate, I get same 20 as if I played A1.

So **delegating can only give me a benefit when P1 also delegates**.

But if P1 also delegates, and I delegate → outcome is A0 vs A0 → I get 10.

Whereas if I don’t delegate and P1 delegates:
- I play A0 → P1 plays A1 → I get 2
- I play A1 → P1 plays A1 → I get 4

So if P1 delegates, I do better by delegating (10) than by playing A1 (4) or A0 (2).

So delegation gives a **big payoff boost when P1 delegates**.

But when P1 doesn't delegate, delegation gives same or worse payoff.

So **delegation is beneficial if P1 is likely to delegate**, and dangerous if P1 plays A0 (but not worse than A1 in that case).

Wait: if P1 plays A0:
- If I play A0 → I get 10
- If I play A1 → 20
- If I play A2 → I get 20 (since I get A1 via mediator)

So when P1 plays A0, A2 gives 20 — same as A1.

When P1 plays A1:
- A0: I get 2
- A1: 4
- A2: 4 (same as A1)

When P1 plays A2:
- A0: 2
- A1: 4
- A2: 10

So **delegation is strictly better than A1 when P1 plays A2**, and equal to A1 otherwise.

And better than A0 in all cases except when P1 plays A0 and I play A0 — but A2 gives 20 same as A1.

So: **Delegating is never worse than A1**, and **strictly better when P1 plays A2**.

Therefore, **A2 is weakly dominant over A1**.

Is it?

- When P1 plays A0: A2 gives 20, A1 gives 20 → same
- When P1 plays A1: A2 gives 4, A1 gives 4 → same
- When P1 plays A2: A2 gives 10, A1 gives 4 → better

So yes: **A2 weakly dominates A1**.

Similarly, compare A2 vs A0:
- P1 plays A0: A0 → 10, A2 → 20 → better
- P1 plays A1: A0 → 2, A2 → 4 → better
- P1 plays A2: A0 → 2, A2 → 10 → better

So **A2 dominates A0** strongly.

Thus: **A2 is a strictly dominant strategy**? Wait:

- A2 gives strictly better payoff than A0 or A1 in **all cases except when P1 plays A0**, where A2 gives same as A1 but better than A0.

But **A2 gives 20 when P1 plays A0**, while A0 gives 10 — so **A2 is strictly better than A0 when P1 plays A0**.

And when P1 plays A1: A2 gives 4, A0 gives 2 — strictly better.

When P1 plays A2: A2 gives 10, A0 gives 2 — strictly better.

So **A2 strictly dominates A0 and A1**.

Wait: is that true?

Yes:
- Against P1's A0: A2 → 20 > A0's 10, A1's 20 → same as A1
- Against P1's A1: A2 → 4 > A0's 2, A1's 4 → same
- Against P1's A2: A2 → 10 > A0's 2, A1's 4

Therefore, A2 gives **strictly greater or equal** payoff in all cases, and **strictly greater** in two of three cases.

So A2 **strictly dominates both A0 and A1**.

Therefore, **no matter what Player 1 does, A2 is at least as good, and strictly better in some cases**.

So A2 is a **better choice than A0 or A1 in every possible scenario**.

Thus, **in a rational setting, I should always choose A2 — delegate**.

But is that correct?

Wait: **But the mediator’s action depends on the number of delegates**, and when **I delegate and P1 does not**, then the mediator plays A1 (since only one delegate), so I get A1.

And if P1 plays A0, I get 20 — good.
If P1 plays A1, I get 4 — same as playing A1.

But the key is: **there is no downside to delegating compared to playing A1, and always a potential upside when P1 delegates**.

Moreover, if P1 is rational, they might also prefer to delegate if it gives them benefit.

But even if P1 does not delegate, I still get the same or better payoff.

Therefore, **A2 is a dominant strategy**.

Hence, **I should always delegate**.

So my strategy: P(A2) = 100%, P(A0) = 0, P(A1) = 0

But wait — is there a possibility that **by not delegating**, I can trigger a better outcome?

For example, suppose I play A1 and P1 plays A0 → I get 20.

But if I delegate and P1 plays A0 → I also get A1 → 20.

Same.

But if P1 plays A1 and I play A1 → I get 4.

If I delegate → same.

But if P1 plays A2 and I don’t → I get 4 (if I play A1) or 2 (if I play A0)

But if I delegate → I get 10.

So only when P1 delegates do I benefit.

But delegation is safe: never worse than A1.

So **no rational player should ever play A0 or A1** when A2 is available and strictly better.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to **always delegate**.

Thus, I should assign:

- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

But let me check: is there any **incentive for Player 1 to not delegate**?

Suppose I **always delegate** (A2 with 100%).

Then:
- If P1 plays A0 → I delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → I play A1, P1 plays A0 → I get 20
- If P1 plays A1 → I delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → I play A1, P1 plays A1 → I get 4
- If P1 plays A2 → both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → I get 10

So P1’s payoffs:

- If P1 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (because I play A1)
- If P1 plays A1: P1 plays A1, I play A1 → P1 gets 4
- If P1 plays A2: both A0 → P1 gets 10

So P1's best responses:
- A0: 10
- A1: 4
- A2: 10

So P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2.

So P1 might choose A0 or A2.

But if I play A2 with certainty, then P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2.

But if P1 chooses A0 → I get 20
If P1 chooses A2 → I get 10

But since I am committed to A2, and P1 chooses A0 → I get 20, which is better than 10.

But P1 might choose A2 instead.

But even if P1 chooses A2, I get 10 — still better than if I played A1 (4) or A0 (2).

And if P1 plays A0, I get 20.

So from my perspective: **if I always delegate, I get at least 10 points, up to 20, depending on P1**.

But my **worst-case** is 10.

But if I played A1, and P1 played A0 → I get 20 (good), but if P1 plays A1 → I get 4 (bad).

So my **worst-case** is 4 with A1.

With A2, worst-case is 10.

And best-case is 20 — same.

So **A2 is better in the worst-case**.

Moreover, A2 is **strictly better than A1 in two scenarios** (P1 plays A1 or A2), and equal in one (P1 plays A0).

So A2 dominates A1.

Similarly, compared to A0: even worse.

So **A2 is a dominant strategy**.

Hence, I **should always delegate**.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

But wait — is there a possibility that by randomizing, I can do better?

Suppose I play A2 with 50%, A1 with 50%.

Then:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 20 with prob 50%, and 20 with prob 50% — still 20
- If P1 plays A1: I get 4 with prob 50% (A1), and 4 with prob 50% (A2) — still 4
- If P1 plays A2: I get 10 with prob 50% (A2), and 4 with prob 50% (A1) → expected 7

But if I play A2 always, I get 10 when P1 plays A2.

So 7 < 10 → worse.

So randomizing downgrades my expected payoff in the P1=A2 case.

Therefore, **pure A2 is better**.

Similarly, any mixing with A0 or A1 hurts.

Hence, **pure strategy of A2 is optimal**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To maximize our points in this game, we analyze the payoffs for each possible action combination, specifically factoring in the mediator's role (A2).

### 1. Identify the Payoff Matrix
The points for each outcome (P1, P2) are as follows:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### 2. Incorporate the Mediator (A2)
The mediator's rules are:
- If only one player delegates (A2), they play A1.
- If both players delegate (A2), both play A0.

Updating the matrix to include A2 (P2 is You):
- (A0, A2): P2 delegates alone $\rightarrow$ (A0, A1) $\rightarrow$ P1=0, P2=20
- (A1, A2): P2 delegates alone $\rightarrow$ (A1, A1) $\rightarrow$ P1=4, P2=4
- (A2, A0): P1 delegates alone $\rightarrow$ (A1, A0) $\rightarrow$ P1=6, P2=2
- (A2, A1): P1 delegates alone $\rightarrow$ (A1, A1) $\rightarrow$ P1=4, P2=4
- (A2, A2): Both delegate $\rightarrow$ (A0, A0) $\rightarrow$ P1=10, P2=10

### 3. Analyze Player 2's (Your) Strategies
Comparing your payoffs for each action:
- **If P1 plays A0**: A0=10, A1=20, A2=20
- **If P1 plays A1**: A0=2, A1=4, A2=4
- **If P1 plays A2**: A0=2, A1=4, A2=10

For Player 2, **A2 weakly dominates A1** (it provides equal or higher payoffs in every scenario) and **strictly dominates A0**. Specifically, if Player 1 also acts rationally and chooses A2, your payoff for choosing A2 (10) is significantly higher than for A1 (4) or A0 (2).

### 4. Analyze Player 1's Strategies
- **If P2 plays A2** (your most likely move): P1 gets A0=0, A1=4, A2=10.
Thus, Player 1's best response to your dominant choice (A2) is also A2.

### 5. Conclusion
Both players have a strong incentive to delegate to the mediator (A2). This creates a stable Nash Equilibrium (A2, A2) resulting in a payoff of 10 points for each player. Compared to any other independent strategy (which would likely lead to a 4,4 outcome), delegating is the optimal choice.

Both proposed mediators have exactly the same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that delegator.  
- If 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both delegators.

Since there is no behavioral difference between M1 and M2, which one gets selected doesn’t affect my eventual strategic options or payoffs. Therefore I’m indifferent between them, and approving both weakly increases the chance that an approved mediator is selected in any approval-profile.

response:
1. Without any mediator, Player 2 has a dominant action: **A1** (it gives them higher payoff no matter what I do). Anticipating that, my best response is also **A1**, so the likely outcome is **(A1, A1)** giving me **4**.

2. With either proposed mediator:
   - If **both** players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both → outcome **(A0, A0)** gives me **10** (better than 4), and also gives Player 2 **10** (also better than 4).
   - If only one delegates, the delegator is forced to **A1**, which doesn’t hurt relative to the baseline (it still leads to **(A1, A1)** if the other plays independently).

3. Since **M1 and M2 are identical**, approving one vs the other doesn’t change the strategic possibilities; approving both weakly increases the chance that a mediator is selected without any downside.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we evaluate the available actions and the payoff matrix, including the additional delegation option (A2).

### Step 1: Analyze the Base Game (A0 and A1)
The payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2 is:
- (A0, A0): 10, 10
- (A0, A1): 0, 20
- (A1, A0): 6, 2
- (A1, A1): 4, 4

For Player 2, action **A1** is a strictly dominant strategy. Regardless of whether Player 1 plays A0 or A1, Player 2 gets more points by playing A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1 would be forced to play A1 to get 4 points instead of A0's 0 points. The base Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

### Step 2: Analyze the Mediator Action (A2)
Action A2 allows delegation to a mediator with specific rules:
- If 1 player delegates (A2): The mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- If 2 players delegate (A2): The mediator plays **A0** for both players.

Let’s reconstruct the payoff matrix including A2:
- **(A2, A0)**: Only Player 1 delegates. Mediator plays A1 for P1. Resulting action pair (A1, A0). Payoff: (6, 2).
- **(A2, A1)**: Only Player 1 delegates. Mediator plays A1 for P1. Resulting action pair (A1, A1). Payoff: (4, 4).
- **(A0, A2)**: Only Player 2 delegates. Mediator plays A1 for P2. Resulting action pair (A0, A1). Payoff: (0, 20).
- **(A1, A2)**: Only Player 2 delegates. Mediator plays A1 for P2. Resulting action pair (A1, A1). Payoff: (4, 4).
- **(A2, A2)**: Both delegate. Mediator plays A0 for both. Resulting action pair (A0, A0). Payoff: (10, 10).

### Step 3: Determine Dominant Strategies in the Expanded Game
Comparing Player 1's options:
- **A0**: Payoffs {10, 0, 0}
- **A1**: Payoffs {6, 4, 4}
- **A2**: Payoffs {6, 4, 10}
For Player 1, action **A2** weakly dominates A1 and is generally safer than A0.

Comparing Player 2's options:
- **A0**: Payoffs {10, 2, 2}
- **A1**: Payoffs {20, 4, 4}
- **A2**: Payoffs {20, 4, 10}
For Player 2, action **A2** weakly dominates A1 and strictly dominates A0.

### Step 4: Final Strategy
In a game where both players aim to maximize their own points, both players should logically choose the weakly dominant action **A2**. This results in the cooperative (10, 10) payoff. If one player chooses to delegate while the other does not, the delegating player is still protected by the mediator (resulting in the same payoff as if they had played A1). 

Therefore, allocating 100% probability to **A2** is the optimal choice.

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

response:
To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff structure from the perspective of Player 2:

- **A0, A0:** P2 gets 10, P1 gets 10.
- **A1, A0:** P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0. (P2 chooses A1, P1 chooses A0)
- **A0, A1:** P2 gets 2, P1 gets 6. (P2 chooses A0, P1 chooses A1)
- **A1, A1:** P2 gets 4, P1 gets 4.

**Analysis without a mediator:**
- Player 2 has a dominant strategy: A1 (20 > 10 if P1 chooses A0; 4 > 2 if P1 chooses A1).
- Player 1, knowing P2 will likely play A1, will choose their best response to A1. If P1 plays A0, they get 0; if P1 plays A1, they get 4. Thus, P1 will choose A1.
- The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in 4 points for each player.

**Analysis of the mediators (M1 and M2 are identical):**
The mediators propose the following:
- If 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0 for both players.

If both players delegate (Del, Del), the outcome is (A0, A0), resulting in (10, 10).
If only one player delegates (e.g., P1 delegates, P2 stays independent):
- The mediator plays A1 for P1.
- P2, playing independently, will choose A1 (their dominant strategy).
- The outcome is (A1, A1), resulting in (4, 4).
If neither player delegates, the outcome is the standard Nash Equilibrium (4, 4).

**Conclusion:**
Delegating to either mediator provides a mechanism to reach the (10, 10) payoff, which is significantly better than the standard equilibrium of (4, 4). Since the mediator only plays the cooperative action (A0) if both players agree to it, it serves as a coordination device that protects both players from the lower (4, 4) outcome while incentivizing the higher (10, 10) outcome. Both M1 and M2 function identically and provide a path to a superior result.

response:
To solve this problem and choose the optimal probabilities for each action, we need to consider both the immediate payoffs of each action and the potential benefit of delegating to the mediator. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix
First, let's look at the payoff matrix for the actions without delegation:

- **(A0, A0)**: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
- **(A1, A0)**: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- **(A0, A1)**: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
- **(A1, A1)**: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.

### Step 2: Inclusion of the Mediator
Now let's consider the inclusion of the mediator:
- If only one player delegates to the mediator, the mediator plays action A1.
- If both players delegate to the mediator, the mediator plays action A0.

### Step 3: Analyze Options Impacting Points
#### Scenario Analysis
1. **Both Players Act Independently:**
   - We assume either player could choose A0 or A1.

2. **Both Players Delegate to Mediator:**
   - The mediator plays action A0.
   - This results in both players getting 10 points since (A0, A0) yields 10 points each.

3. **Mixed Delegation and Action:**
   - If only Player 2 delegates:
      - Mediator for Player 2 plays A1.
      - Player 1's independent action affects the result.
   - If only Player 1 delegates:
      - Mediator for Player 1 plays A1.
      - Player 2's independent action affects the result.

#### Payoff from Mixed Actions
- **Player 2 Delegates:**
  - (A1 if the mediator, A0) = (20, 0) or (A1, A1) = (4, 4)—depending on the choice of Player 1.
- **Player 1 Delegates:**
  - We might end up with:
    - (A1 if the mediator, A1) = (4, 4)

### Step 4: Strategy Proposal
Considering the mediator helps assure a certain stable outcome when both players delegate, delegating offers some balanced points. Evaluating mixed strategies between going independent and delegating is critical.

#### Expected Points Calculation
- Independently:
  - Mixed strategy with Player 1 could intermix payoffs.
  
### Step 5: Summarizing Strategy
Balancing between concrete high value (while both delegate) and variability (when independent choices are explored):

```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 10, "A2": 80}
```
- **Delegate (A2)**: High probability (80%) to both benefit when we synchronize.
- **Action A0/A1 Independently**: Explore individual node outcomes.

Thus, our final optimal mixed strategy encompasses highest yield predictability and opportunistic engagement.

- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Now, we introduce action A2 (Delegate to Mediator):
- If one player delegates (A2), the mediator plays action A1 for them.
- If both players delegate (A2), the mediator plays action A0 for both.

This expands the matrix to:
- (A0, A2): Only P2 delegates, so P2 plays A1. Payoff (A0, A1) = (0, 20).
- (A1, A2): Only P2 delegates, so P2 plays A1. Payoff (A1, A1) = (4, 4).
- (A2, A0): Only P1 delegates, so P1 plays A1. Payoff (A1, A0) = (6, 2).
- (A2, A1): Only P1 delegates, so P1 plays A1. Payoff (A1, A1) = (4, 4).
- (A2, A2): Both delegate, so both play A0. Payoff (A0, A0) = (10, 10).

Analyzing Player 2's options:
- Against P1 playing A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 20, A2 gives 20.
- Against P1 playing A1: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4, A2 gives 4.
- Against P1 playing A2: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4, A2 gives 10.
For Player 2, action A2 weakly dominates action A1 (it is always at least as good and better in one case) and strictly dominates action A0.

Analyzing Player 1's options:
- Since Player 2 is likely to choose A2 (their dominant strategy), Player 1's payoffs against A2 are: A0 = 0, A1 = 4, A2 = 10.
- Player 1's best response to A2 is A2.

Both players choosing A2 results in a mutual payoff of 10 points. This is a Nash equilibrium reached through dominant strategies. Any other combination of moves results in a lower payoff for at least one player or leaves them vulnerable to defection. For instance, (A0, A0) also yields 10 points each, but if Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 is incentivized to choose A2 or A1 to get 20 points. Delegation (A2) effectively stabilizes the win-win (10, 10) outcome.

response:
Both proposed mediators have the exact same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for the delegator.
- If both players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both delegators.

In the underlying game, there are two coordination equilibria: **(A0, A0)** (10 each) and **(A1, A1)** (4 each). The mediator creates a clean way to coordinate on the better outcome:

- If we **both delegate**, we get **(A0, A0)** → **10 points** for me (best).
- If I **delegate but the other doesn’t**, I’m forced to **A1**; the other’s best response is **A1**, giving me **4** (not great, but not catastrophic).
- Since both mediators are identical, approving both only increases the chance that *some* mediator is selected (with no tradeoff between them).

So I approve both.

# Step-by-step Analysis

## Understanding my position as Player 2

My payoff matrix (rows = my actions, columns = opponent's actions):
```
           Opp A0    Opp A1
My A0        10        2
My A1        20        4
```

## Game without mediator

In the basic game:
- A1 strictly dominates A0 for me (20 > 10 when opponent plays A0; 4 > 2 when opponent plays A1)
- Similarly, Player 1 has strategic considerations that lead to a Nash equilibrium at (A1, A1) yielding (4, 4)
- The efficient outcome (A0, A0) yielding (10, 10) is NOT a Nash equilibrium because both players have incentive to deviate to A1

## Analyzing both mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

## Delegation game outcomes

With either mediator, the key scenarios are:

1. **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → (10, 10)
2. **Only one delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for that player, leading to equilibrium → (4, 4)
3. **Neither delegates**: Original game → (4, 4)

## Finding Nash equilibria with mediator

If both players delegate:
- Each gets 10 points
- If I deviate to A1, I get 4 points (worse)
- If I deviate to A0, I get 2 points (worse)
- Neither player has incentive to deviate!

This means **(Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium** yielding (10, 10).

## Key insight

The mediator acts as a **commitment device** that enables both players to credibly coordinate on the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome, which is impossible in the basic game due to individual incentives to deviate.

## Conclusion

Since both mediators are identical and both enable coordination on the superior (10, 10) equilibrium compared to the (4, 4) equilibrium without mediation, I should approve both.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediation)**

We are Player 2 (you), and the game has the following payoff matrix (with you as Player 2, the row player, and the other player as Player 1, the column player):

| Your Action \ Opponent’s Action | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-------------------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)**                   | 10,10  | 2,6    |
| **A1 (P2)**                   | 20,0   | 4,4    |

So, as Player 2:
- If you choose A0 and P1 chooses A0 → you get 10
- If you choose A1 and P1 chooses A0 → you get 20
- If you choose A0 and P1 chooses A1 → you get 2
- If you choose A1 and P1 chooses A1 → you get 4

Let’s find the **Nash equilibrium** of this base game, but we’ll keep in mind that we may not be playing the base game — we have a delegation option.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze strategic incentives in the base game (without delegation)**

Let’s find best responses.

#### If you (P2) choose A0:
- P1’s best response:
  - If P1 chooses A0 → gets 10
  - If P1 chooses A1 → gets 6 → so P1 prefers A0
  → So if you play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 10

#### If you (P2) choose A1:
- P1’s best response:
  - If P1 chooses A0 → gets 0
  - If P1 chooses A1 → gets 4 → so P1 plays A1 → you get 4

So:
- If you play A0 → you get 10 (P1 plays A0)
- If you play A1 → you get 4 (P1 plays A1)

So **your best response** is to play **A0**, which gets you 10.

But wait — that assumes the other player is rational and acts in their own interest.

Now let's suppose **you play A0**, P1 will play A0 (since 10 > 6) → you get 10.

But suppose **P1 plays A0**, then **you** would prefer A1 (20 > 10), so you would deviate.

So we have a **conflict of incentives**.

Let’s look for the **Nash equilibrium**.

---

#### Best responses:

**Player 1 (P1) best responses:**

- If you (P2) play A0:
  - P1 gets: A0 → 10, A1 → 6 → so P1 plays A0
- If you (P2) play A1:
  - P1 gets: A0 → 0, A1 → 4 → so P1 plays A1

So P1’s best response:
- A0 if you play A0
- A1 if you play A1

**Player 2 (you) best responses:**

- If P1 plays A0:
  - You get: A0 → 10, A1 → 20 → so you play A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - You get: A0 → 2, A1 → 4 → so you play A1

So your best response is always **A1**, regardless of P1's action.

Wait: if P1 plays A1, you get 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → A1 is better.

If P1 plays A0, A1 gives 20 vs 10 → clearly better.

So **your best response is always A1**.

But P1’s best response is:
- A0 if you play A0
- A1 if you play A1

So **if you play A1**, P1 plays A1 → result: A1 vs A1 → you get 4

But if **you played A0**, P1 would play A0 → you get 10.

But since you **prefer A1**, you will play A1.

Then P1, knowing you will play A1 (if rational), would play A1 → you get 4.

But if you could **commit** to A0, you’d get 10.

But you can't commit unless you **delegate**.

This is a **commitment game**.

You can **delegate to a mediator** to help you commit to a strategy — or perhaps to randomize.

Now, we get to **choose which mediators to approve** via **approval voting**. The mediator with the most approvals wins, and if multiple tie, it’s chosen uniformly at random.

Only **one mediator** will be used (the one with the most approvals, randomly selected in case of tie).

Then, you and the other player simultaneously decide: **delegate** or **not delegate**.

> Important: You can **choose to delegate** or **not**, but only if a mediator is appointed.

So **your decision depends on:**
1. Which mediator(s) you approve (to increase their chance of being selected)
2. The behavior of the other player
3. Whether you should delegate or not

But first, **you must approve mediators**.

Let’s examine the **two mediators** on offer.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the mediators**

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):**
- If 1 player delegates to it → plays **A1**
- If 2 players delegate to it → plays **A0**

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):**
- If 1 player delegates to it → plays **A0**
- If 2 players delegate to it → plays **A1**

---

### **Step 4: Think about the role of delegation**

You can **choose to delegate** to a mediator, or **act independently**.

But **you can only delegate to the mediator that wins the approval vote**.

So your approval choice affects **which mediator is available**, and hence what strategies are possible.

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, so you should approve mediators that, when selected, give you a better outcome **assuming rational behavior by both players**.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze potential outcomes under each mediator**

Let’s suppose **M1** is selected (Player 1’s mediator).

Then:
- If **only one player delegates**, M1 plays A1
- If **both players delegate**, M1 plays A0

What does that mean?

If **you delegate** to M1, **and the other does not**, then M1 plays A1 → you get A1.

If **you delegate and the other delegates**, then M1 plays A0 → you get A0.

If **neither delegates**, then you play independently — as per base game.

Similarly for M2.

But **your choice** depends on **your belief about the other player’s behavior**, and vice versa.

But you are trying to **maximize** your points — so let’s think strategically about **what you prefer**, and **how the mediator’s behavior can help you commit**.

---

#### **Goal: Can a mediator help you commit to A0?**

Why is that important?

Because in the base game, even though **A0 gives you 10** when P1 plays A0, but **you want to play A1** because it gives you 20 when they play A0.

But P1 **knows that** — so if they think you'll play A1, they'll play A1 → you get only 4.

But **if you could commit to A0**, then P1 would play A0 (getting 10) → you get 10.

But you can't commit voluntarily — because you can deviate.

But **delegation** allows **commitment** if the mediator’s action is binding.

So **if you delegate to a mediator that plays A0 when both delegate**, then you can **commit to a strategy that forces the outcome to be (A0,A0)**, if both commit.

Let’s explore that.

---

### **Case 1: M1 is selected (Player 1’s mediator)**

M1:
- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

So **if both players delegate**, M1 plays A0 → so outcome is A0 (you) vs A0 (P1)

If only one delegates, the other acts independently.

Suppose you **want to get A0**, and you are willing to delegate.

But if **only you delegate**, M1 plays A1 → so you play A1.

But you don’t want that.

So **if you delegate to M1**, you get A1 if they don’t delegate, or A0 if they do.

But if you’re the only one delegating, you **end up with A1** → which might not be desirable.

Can you **induce** both to delegate?

Suppose you **threaten to delegate** only if they do — but that's coordination.

But in this game, **you choose to delegate or not simultaneously**, after the mediator is chosen.

So it’s simultaneous.

Let’s suppose **M1 is the mediator**.

Let’s suppose **you delegate**, and the other player chooses whether to delegate.

You want to **coordinate on both delegating** → then you get A0.

But if only you delegate → you get A1 (bad)

If they delegate and you don’t → they get A0 → so P1 plays A0 → then you, playing independently, will play A1 (since A1 gives you 20 vs 10) → so you get 20.

Wait, that’s **great** for you.

So if **only the other player delegates**, M1 plays A0 (since two delegates? No!

Wait.

**Important**: "If 1 player delegates" → M1 plays A1

"If 2 players delegate" → M1 plays A0

So:
- 0 delegates: no M1 action → both play independently
- 1 delegate: M1 plays A1 → so the delegated player plays A1
- 2 delegates: M1 plays A0 → both players play A0 (since both use M1)

So:

#### If M1 is selected:

- Case 1: **Both delegate** → M1 plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 10
- Case 2: **You delegate, other doesn’t** → M1 plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays independently

Now, **what does the other player do**?
- They are playing independently.
- You are playing A1 → so P1 (the other) knows you are playing A1.
- So P1’s best response: If you play A1, they get:
  - A0 → 0
  - A1 → 4 → so they play A1
  → So outcome: A1, A1 → you get 4

- Case 3: **You don’t delegate, other does** → M1 plays A1 → so P1 plays A1 → you play independently
  - P1 plays A1 → so you, playing independently, get:
    - A0 → 2
    - A1 → 4 → so you play A1 → outcome: A1, A1 → you get 4

- Case 4: **Neither delegates** → both play independently
  - As in base game: you play A1 (best response), P1 plays A1 (best response) → outcome A1,A1 → you get 4

Now, **let’s analyze your incentive to delegate when M1 is selected**:

- If you **delegate**, your outcome depends on the other's choice.

  - If other delegates → outcome A0,A0 → you get 10
  - If other doesn’t delegate → you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4

  So your **expected payoff** from delegating: 10 * P(other delegates) + 4 * P(other doesn’t delegate)

  But you don’t control their choice.

  However, **you can model it with rational players**, and suppose **they also want to maximize their own payoff**.

  But you’re only concerned with **your payoff**.

  Let’s suppose the other player also wants to maximize their own payoff.

  So let’s analyze their best response to your choice.

But we need to know what the **other player** would do.

But we’re the only one making decisions — we’re the only player with a known objective.

So to make **rational predictions**, we assume both players are rational and **know each other's preferences**.

So let’s try to find a **Nash equilibrium** of this **delegation game** (once mediator is fixed).

But instead, let’s think about **what you would prefer** — and **which mediator gives you better worst-case or expected payoff**.

But we are to approve mediators **in advance**, before knowing who delegates.

So we want to **approve mediators that are likely to help you** get higher payoffs, **assuming both players act rationally**.

So let's consider **each mediator**, and see **what outcomes are possible**.

---

### **Analyze M1 (Player 1’s mediator)**

As above, if M1 is selected:

| Your Delegation | Other Delegates? | Outcome | Your Payoff |
|------------------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| Yes              | Yes              | A0,A0  | 10          |
| Yes              | No               | A1,A1  | 4           |
| No               | Yes              | A1,A1  | 4           |
| No               | No               | A1,A1  | 4           |

So only if **both delegate**, you get 10.

But if only one delegates, you get 4.

If neither delegates, you get 4.

So your **only way to get more than 4 is to coordinate on both delegating**.

But is that **rational**?

Suppose **you** are willing to delegate **only if** the other will too.

But can you **induce** the other to delegate?

Suppose you **do not delegate**. Then, if the other delegates, they get to play A1 (because only one delegate), and you play independently → you play A1 → outcome A1,A1 → you get 4.

But if **you** could induce **both to delegate**, you get 10.

But the **other player** also wants to maximize their payoff.

So what does **the other player** gain from delegation?

Let’s suppose **you delegate**, and **they consider whether to delegate**.

If **you delegate**, and they **do not delegate**: outcome is A1 (you) vs A1 (P1) → P1 gets 4

If **you delegate**, and they **do delegate**: outcome A0,A0 → P1 gets 10

So **P1** gets 10 if they delegate, 4 if not → so **P1 has strong incentive to delegate** if you are delegating.

That’s a big deal.

Similarly, if **you** do not delegate, and **P1** delegates: they play A1 (since only one delegate), and you play independently → you play A1 → outcome A1,A1 → you get 4.

But if **P1** delegates and **you do not**, you get 4.

So P1 gets 4 regardless.

But if **you** are not delegating, can P1 do better?

If P1 delegates → they play A1 → you play independently → you play A1 → they get 4

If P1 does not delegate → both play independently → you play A1, they play A1 → they get 4

So **no difference**.

So **if you do not delegate**, P1 is indifferent between delegating and not — gets 4 either way.

But **if you do delegate**, P1 gets **10** (by also delegating) vs **4** (by not delegating).

So P1 will **definitely delegate** if you do.

Now, what should **you** do?

If you **do not delegate**, then P1 is indifferent → so we have to assume they might not delegate → outcome: A1,A1 → 4

If you **do delegate**, then P1 will delegate (since 10 > 4), so outcome: A0,A0 → you get 10

So **your payoff**:
- If you delegate: 10
- If you don’t: 4

So your **best response** is to **delegate** — and you will get 10.

So **if M1 is selected**, you can **commit to delegating**, and **induce the other to delegate**, and both get 10.

So your payoff is **10**.

Nice!

Can you get better?

Well, 10 is better than 4, but in the base game you get 4.

But is there a better outcome?

Only if outcome is A1,A0 → you get 20

But that requires you to play A1, and P1 to play A0.

But P1 won’t play A0 if they think you are playing A1 — they get 0 vs 4 → won’t go.

So **not possible**.

So **10 is best you can get under M1**.

So M1 is **good for you** — allows you to get 10.

---

### **Now analyze M2 (Player 2’s mediator)**

M2:
- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A1

So:

| Your Delegation | Other Delegates? | Outcome | Your Payoff |
|------------------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| Yes              | Yes              | A1,A1  | 4           |
| Yes              | No               | A0,A1? → no: you play A0 (M2 plays A0), other plays independently |
| No               | Yes              | A1,A0 → you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 20 |
| No               | No               | A1,A1  | 4           |

Let’s be precise.

- If you delegate, M2 plays A0 (if only one, but you are one) → so if only you delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0
- If both delegate → M2 plays A1 → both play A1

- If only other delegates → M2 plays A0 → so P1 plays A0 → you play independently → you can choose A1 or A0

So:

#### Case 1: You delegate, other delegates → M2 plays A1 → both play A1 → you get 4

#### Case 2: You delegate, other does not → M2 plays A0 → you play A0 → P1 plays independently
- P1 sees you play A0 → so P1’s best response: A0 → 10, A1 → 6 → so plays A0 → outcome: A0,A0 → you get 10

#### Case 3: You do not delegate, other delegates → M2 plays A0 → P1 plays A0 → you play independently → you see P1 plays A0 → so you play A1 → outcome: A1,A0 → you get 20

#### Case 4: Neither delegates → both play independently → you play A1, P1 plays A1 → you get 4

Now, let’s analyze your **incentives**.

Suppose **you don’t delegate**. Then:
- If P1 delegates → outcome A1,A0 → you get 20
- If P1 doesn’t delegate → outcome A1,A1 → you get 4

So you **want** P1 to delegate.

But does P1 have incentive to delegate?

Suppose **you don’t delegate**.

P1 is considering: should they delegate?

- If P1 delegates → they play A0 → you play independently → you see A0 → you play A1 → outcome A1,A0 → P1 gets 0
- If P1 does not delegate → both play independently → you play A1, P1 plays A1 → outcome A1,A1 → P1 gets 4

So P1 gets **0** if they delegate, **4** if they don’t → so **P1 will not delegate**.

So **if you don’t delegate**, P1 will not delegate (since 4 > 0), so outcome A1,A1 → you get 4

Now, suppose **you do delegate**.

Then:
- If P1 delegates → you get 4 (A1,A1)
- If P1 doesn’t delegate → you get 10 (A0,A0)

But will P1 delegate?

If you delegate, P1’s choice:

- If P1 delegates → they play A1 (since two delegates) → you play A0 → so outcome A0,A1 → P1 gets 6
- If P1 does not delegate → they play independently → see you play A0 → so they play A0 → outcome A0,A0 → P1 gets 10

So P1 gets **10** if they don’t delegate, **6** if they do.

So **P1 will not delegate**.

Therefore, if you delegate, P1 does **not** delegate → outcome: A0,A0 → you get 10

So your payoff:
- If you **don’t delegate**: P1 doesn’t delegate → you get 4
- If you **do delegate**: P1 doesn’t delegate → you get 10

So again, **you prefer to delegate** → get 10

But **wait**, in this case, **if you delegate**, you get 10

And you can’t get more than 10

But earlier we said P1 doesn’t delegate → okay.

So under M2, **if you delegate**, you get 10

If you don’t, you get 4

So you delegate → get 10

Same as with M1.

But is this true?

Wait: in M2 case 3, when you don’t delegate and P1 delegates → you get 20

But **P1 won't volunteer to delegate** because they get 0 (since you play A1) vs 4 (if not)

So **P1 will never delegate** if you don’t delegate

And **if you delegate**, P1 still doesn’t delegate (because they prefer 10 to 6)

So **P1 never delegates**

Then:
- If you delegate: outcome A0,A0 → you get 10
- If you don’t delegate: outcome A1,A1 → you get 4

So you **choose to delegate** → get 10

Same result as with M1.

But **is there a difference between M1 and M2**?

Wait — in M1, when you delegate, you get A0,A0 only if P1 also delegates.

But we showed that **if you delegate, P1 will delegate** (because they get 10 vs 4)

So **under M1: both delegate → A0,A0 → you get 10**

Under M2: if you delegate, P1 does **not** delegate → but you play A0 → P1 plays A0 (because they see A0) → outcome A0,A0 → you get 10

So **in both cases, you get 10**

But under M1: **both must delegate**

Under M2: you **must** delegate, and P1 **does not**, but still gets A0 naturally.

So **same outcome, but different mechanism**

But wait — in M1, **P1 is forced to play A0 only if both delegate**, but if only P1 delegates, they play A1.

But we said P1 only delegates if you do → so both delegate → A0

But in M2, P1 **never delegates**, because they don’t want to play A0

So M1 allows both to commit, M2 requires only you to commit.

But result is same: you get 10

So both mediators seem to allow **you to get 10**

But let’s double-check M2.

Suppose you **delegate** to M2.

M2 plays A0 (because only you delegate) → you play A0

P1 sees you play A0 → so P1’s best response is A0 → so they play A0

Outcome: A0,A0 → you get 10

P1 gets 10 — good for them

But if P1 were to delegate, M2 plays A1 → so they play A1 → you play A0 → outcome A0,A1 → they get 6

But they can get 10 by not delegating → so they won’t delegate → correct.

So yes, you get 10

Now, **can you get more than 10**?

Only if outcome is A1,A0 → you get 20

But that would require you to play A1 and P1 to play A0

But if you play A1, P1 sees that and plays A1 → gets 4, instead of 0

So P1 won’t play A0 unless you play A0

So **A1,A0 is not sustainable**

So **10 is the maximum possible** under both mediators

So **both M1 and M2 allow you to get 10**

But is that true?

Wait — **only if your delegation is credible**

But in both cases, we’ve shown that **you can commit to delegation**, and the outcome is **A0,A0** → you get 10

So both mediators are good.

But wait — is there any **difference**?

Let’s look at **when you delegate**:

- In M1: if you delegate, and P1 doesn’t, then M1 plays A1 → you play A1 → P1 sees A1 → plays A1 → you get 4
  But **P1 will choose to delegate** (because 10 > 4), so they do → outcome A0,A0 → you get 10
- In M2: if you delegate, and P1 doesn’t, you play A0 → P1 sees A0 → plays A0 → you get 10

So in M1, **P1** will **cooperate** to delegate, so both play A0

In M2, **P1** does **not** delegate, but still plays A0 independently

So **same outcome**, same payoff for you

So both mediators lead to you getting 10 in equilibrium

But is there a **risk**?

Suppose **you don’t delegate**, and you are not sure if P1 delegates.

But we’ve shown:
- Under M1: if you don’t delegate, P1 is **indifferent** → so might not delegate → you get 4
- Under M2: if you don’t delegate, P1 will **not** delegate (because they get 0 if they do), so you get 4

So **no difference**

But **what if both mediators could be selected?**

No — only one winning mediator

But **we must approve mediators in advance**

Now, **which ones should we approve?**

Suppose we **only approve M1** — then M1 is the only one, so it wins.

Then you can get 10

Suppose we **only approve M2** — same, you get 10

Suppose we approve **both** — then both have 1 approval → tie → selected uniformly at random → so each has 50% chance.

Then, **your expected payoff** is:
- 50% chance M1: you get 10
- 50% chance M2: you get 10
→ expected payoff: 10

Same as if you approved one.

But is there an **incentive to approve both**?

But **no disadvantage** — you still get 10

But **what if the other player also approves?**

We don’t know their preferences.

But we are **only concerned with our own payoff**

And in both cases, you can get 10

But wait — **is there a difference** in the **robustness of the outcome?**

Actually, **no**

But now consider: **what if the other player prefers a different mediator?**

But they are not making decisions now — we are only approving.

But **we are player 2**, and we want to maximize our payoff.

Now, here's the **key insight**:

Under **M1**, your **incentive to delegate** is **stronger**: because if you delegate, you **get A0,A0 only if P1 also delegates**, and **P1 has strong incentive to do so** (10 > 4)

So coordination is easy.

Under **M2**, you also get 10, but **only if you delegate**

But **P1 does not delegate**, so it's not coordinated — but still works.

But **there’s a potential issue**:

In **M2**, if you **don’t delegate**, and P1 **could** delegate, you get 20 — but **P1 won’t**, because they get 0.

But **you can’t get 20**, because P1 won’t cooperate.

So **no better than 10**

But now, **what if the other player has a reason not to approve a mediator?**

We don’t know.

But we **must approve mediators**.

Now, **is there any downside to approving a mediator?**

Not really — because even if you approve a mediator that doesn’t help, it doesn’t hurt you — it only matters if it wins.

But if you **don’t approve** a mediator, it can’t win, so you **lose the chance** to have it.

But **if both are equally good**, then you should **approve both** to increase the chance of having a good one.

But are they equally good?

Yes — both allow you to get 10 in equilibrium.

So **approving both** gives 100% chance of having a good mediator (since both are good), while approving only one gives 50% chance.

Wait — no: the winning mediator is the one with **maximum approvals**

So:
- If you approve **only M1**: M1 has 1, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → you get 10
- If you approve **only M2**: M2 wins → you get 10
- If you approve **both**: both have 1 → tied → chosen uniformly at random → 50% M1, 50% M2 → you get 10 in either case

So **your expected payoff is 10** in all cases

So **no difference**

But **is there a strategic reason to prefer one over the other?**

Wait — **M1 is proposed by Player 1**, M2 by Player 2 — you are Player 2.

But **we are not told about the other player’s preferences**.

But **the other player will also vote**.

So **they will approve mediators they prefer.**

But **you don’t know how they vote**.

But **in the absence of information**, we must assume **rational behavior** and **maximize your own payoff**

Now, suppose the other player is rational.

What would they prefer?

- For **M1**: they see that if they delegate, and you don’t, they get 4 (A1,A1), but if you delegate, they get 10 → so they have incentive to delegate if you do

But **if they don’t delegate**, and you do, they get 10 (A0,A0) — but if you don’t, they get 4.

So they are happy with M1.

- For **M2**: if they delegate, and you don’t, they play A0, you play A1 → outcome A1,A0 → they get 0

But if they don’t delegate, and you don’t, they get 4

So they get **0** if they delegate and you don’t

But if you delegate, they get 6 vs 10 if not → so they won’t delegate.

But **if you don’t delegate**, they get 4, which is better than 0

So they might prefer M2, because they avoid the 0 payoff.

But **in M1**, if you delegate and they don’t, they get 10 — good

But if you don’t, they get 4

So M1 gives them **10 or 4**, M2 gives them **10 or 4**, same?

Wait:

In M1:
- If you delegate and they don’t: outcome A1,A1 → they get 4
- If you don’t and they do: outcome A1,A1 → they get 4
- If both: A0,A0 → 10
- If neither: A1,A1 → 4

So they get 10 only if both delegate.

In M2:
- If you delegate and they don’t: outcome A0,A0 → they get 10
- If you don’t and they do: outcome A1,A0 → they get 0
- If both: A1,A1 → 4
- If neither: A1,A1 → 4

So for **P1 (the other player)**:
- In M1: gets 10 only if **both delegate**
- In M2: gets 10 only if **you delegate** and **they do not**

So M2 **only gives them 10 if you delegate and they don't**

But if they delegate and you don’t, they get 0

So **M2 is riskier** for them.

In M1, they get 10 only if both are coordinated, but at least they don’t get 0.

So **P1 likely prefers M1 over M2**.

Therefore, **P1 will probably approve M1, and not M2**.

As **you**, being Player 2, you want to **maximize the chance that a good mediator is selected**.

But **both M1 and M2 can give you 10**.

But **M1 might be more likely to win** if P1 approves it, and you approve it.

But if you **approve M2**, then M2 might win if P1 approves M2, but P1 probably won’t.

So to **maximize the chance** that **you get 10**, you should **approve M1**, because:
- P1 likely approves M1
- If you approve M1, then M1 has 2 approvals (you and P1) → wins
- M2 has 0 or 1 → not enough

So you get M1 → you get 10

But if you **approve only M2**, then:
- P1 approves M1 → M1 has 1
- You approve M2 → M2 has 1 → tie → random winner
- 50% chance you get M1 → get 10
- 50% chance you get M2 → get 10
- Still 10 expected

Same.

But if you approve **both**, then:
- M1: 1 (P1) + 1 (you) = 2
- M2: 1 (you) → M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins
- So you get M1 → 10

So in all cases, you get 10

So **you get 10 regardless**

But **approving both doesn't hurt**, and if P1 only approves M1, then M1 wins anyway.

If P1 approves M2, then M2 has 1, you have 1 → tie → random → 50% M2 → but M2 also gives you 10

So **no risk**

Therefore, **you should approve both** to be safe.

But is there any **reason not to**?

Suppose **P1 approves both** — then you must decide.

But if P1 approves both, and you approve both, then both M1 and M2 have 2 approvals → tie → random → still 50% each → 10 expected

Same.

So **approving both is safe and gives no downside**

Moreover, **if you approve only one**, you **risk missing out** if the other player approves both.

But no — as long as one mediator is good, you're fine.

But **there’s no worse mediator**, so **approving both is optimal**

Therefore, you should approve both.

### ✅ Final decision:

Approve both mediators.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.

On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand my payoff matrix (as Player 2)
```
                Other Player (P1)
                A0      A1
Player 2  A0    10      2
(Me)      A1    20      4
```

## Step 2: Analyze what happens when I delegate vs play directly

Let's say P1 chooses A0 with probability q₀, A1 with probability q₁, and delegates with probability q₂.

**If I play A0 directly:**
- vs P1's A0: I get 10
- vs P1's A1: I get 2  
- vs P1 delegates (only 1 delegates → mediator plays A1): I get 2
- Expected: 10q₀ + 2q₁ + 2q₂

**If I play A1 directly:**
- vs P1's A0: I get 20
- vs P1's A1: I get 4
- vs P1 delegates (mediator plays A1): I get 4
- Expected: 20q₀ + 4q₁ + 4q₂

**If I delegate (A2):**
- vs P1's A0 (only I delegate → mediator plays A1 for me): I get 20
- vs P1's A1 (only I delegate → mediator plays A1 for me): I get 4
- vs P1 delegates (both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both): I get 10
- Expected: 20q₀ + 4q₁ + 10q₂

## Step 3: Find Nash equilibria

Testing pure strategy profiles:

**(Both delegate, Both delegate):**
- Both get 10 (mediator plays A0 for both)
- If I deviate to A0: I get 2 (worse)
- If I deviate to A1: I get 4 (worse)
- If P1 deviates to A0: P1 gets 0 (worse)
- If P1 deviates to A1: P1 gets 4 (worse)
- **This is a Nash equilibrium!**

**(A1, A1) and similar:**
- Both get 4
- Also equilibria, but Pareto dominated

## Step 4: Compare equilibria

The (delegate, delegate) equilibrium gives both players 10 points, which is:
- The highest mutual payoff possible
- Pareto optimal
- A focal point since the mediator was designed specifically to achieve this coordination

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning

Since P1 proposed this mediator mechanism, they designed it to incentivize mutual delegation leading to the (A0, A0) outcome. This is mutually beneficial and creates a clear coordination point. As a rational player trying to maximize my payoff, I should delegate with probability 1.

response:
To arrive at the decision of which mediators to approve, it's essential to break down the process step by step. We'll start by analyzing the basic payoff matrix and then evaluate the mediators’ strategies based on this.

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

Here is the matrix for the payoffs:

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (10, 10)    | (2, 6)       |
| **Player 2: A1** | (20, 0)     | (4, 4)       |

### Step 2: Analyze Potential Mediator Strategies

Both mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 have the same rules:
- If only one player delegates to the mediator, the mediator will play action A1.
- If both players delegate to the mediator, the mediator will play action A0.

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Outcome

#### Case 1: Both players act independently
- Players could rationally choose A1 for a lower but mutual gain since it provides security against being exploited (resulting in 4 points each). 
- If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1’s best response is also A1 (4 points instead of 2).
- Likewise, if Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2’s best option is A1.

#### Case 2: Both players delegate to a mediator
- If both delegate, the mediator plays A0.
- Result: (10, 10)—a much higher mutual gain than the independent strategy equilibrium.

#### Case 3: One player delegates and the other doesn't
- The delegating player forces the mediator to play A1.
- Outcome depends on independent player’s choice.
  - If independent player chooses A0, result: (0 or 20, depending on who delegates).
  - If independent player chooses A1, result: (4, 4).

### Step 4: Consider Stability and Trust

By reasoning through potential trust and equilibria:
- If both players can trust that the mediator would be selected and both would delegate, they settle at (10, 10), which is better than the (4, 4) at independent A1 choices.
- If there's doubt, a player might prefer acting independently to avoid being exploited.

### Step 5: Decision on approving the mediator

Given that both mediators proposed ("M1" and "M2") are identical and align incentives towards mutual best interest when both delegate, approving both increases the likelihood of adopting this beneficial strategy.

### Final Decision:
Approve both mediators.

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

This solution ensures that, regardless of which mediator is selected under this approval voting system, both players are likely to delegate, leading to the most optimal outcome of 10 points each.

response:
Both proposed mediators have identical rules:

- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for each delegator, which supports the high mutual payoff outcome (**A0,A0** gives me 10).
- If only one player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for that player. Since delegation is optional and I can always choose to act independently later, having this mediator available can’t reduce my options relative to not having it.
- Because **M1 and M2 are the same**, approving both doesn’t change which mediator I face (a random pick among tied winners is still the same behavior).

So I approve both.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To solve this problem, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.

### Step 1: Evaluate the payoffs in the absence of the mediator
We look at the original payoffs for each combination of actions:
- A0 vs A0: (10, 10)
- A1 vs A0: (20, 0)
- A0 vs A1: (2, 6)
- A1 vs A1: (4, 4)

### Step 2: Mix of strategies in the original setup without mediator
To maximize our own points without considering the mediator, we would calculate the expected payoffs for mixed strategies Player 1 might follow, but for now, we shift our analysis to the mediator inclusion due to its explicit intervention.

### Step 3: Inclusion of Mediator
The mediator acts differently based on how many players delegate:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0.

### Step 4: Strategic decisions involving the Mediator
We must now consider the impact of delegating to the mediator. 

1. **If we delegate and the other player does not:**
   - Mediator plays A1 for us.
   - Player 1 might play A0 or A1.
   - Outcomes:
     - Player 1 plays A0: (20, 0)
     - Player 1 plays A1: (4, 4)

2. **If we do not delegate and the other player does delegate:**
   - Player 1 relies on the mediator.
   - We might play A0 or A1.
   - Outcomes:
     - We play A0: (2, 6)
     - We play A1: (4, 4)

3. **If both players delegate:**
   - Mediator chooses A0 for both.
   - Outcome: (10, 10)

4. **If neither delegates:**
   - We play Nash equilibrium strategies of the base game.

### Step 5: Deciding Optimal Mixed Strategy
Given these scenarios, we maximize our expected payoff by strategically choosing probabilities to balance possible actions.

One way to simplify: assume Player 1 is aware of these mechanics and might be inclined to collaborate (hence, also inclined to delegate). We thus lean towards higher probability in delegation.

### Final Adjustment and Mixed Strategy
We balance our strategies with these insights:
- Delegate often but also mix in direct actions to capitalize on Player 1's variability.

Here is the final mixed strategy:
```json
{ "A0": 20, "A1": 20, "A2": 60 }
```

This distribution suggests we delegate ~60% of the time, given the substantial gain in mutual delegation or partial risk in one-sided outcomes. The remaining probabilities maintain our relevance in direct decisions. 

To summarize:
- We leverage the mediator, choosing A2 (delegate) 60% of the time.
- Distribute remaining decisions between A0 and A1, each at 20%.

response:
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) have the *exact same rule*:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for the delegator.
- If 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both delegators.

So, from my perspective as Player 1, there is no strategic difference between selecting M1 vs M2.

Now, should I want such a mediator to be available at all?

- The underlying game has two coordination equilibria: **(A0, A0)** (payoff 10 each) and **(A1, A1)** (payoff 4 each). The good outcome is **(A0, A0)**.
- This mediator creates a clean way to get **(A0, A0)** *if both players delegate* (2 delegators → mediator plays A0).
- If only I delegate, I get **A1**, which is not catastrophic: against A0 I get 6, against A1 I get 4. So delegating doesn’t expose me to a disaster payoff like 0 (which would happen if I played A0 into their A1).

Because having this mediator available gives a plausible coordination path to the high-payoff (A0, A0) outcome, and doesn’t create a uniquely harmful commitment for me, I approve it. Since both mediators are identical, I approve both.

	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
First convert “Delegate to Mediator” (A2) into its effective action:

- If **only you** delegate (you play A2 and the other does not), the mediator plays **A1** for you.
- If **both** delegate (A2,A2), the mediator plays **A0** for both.

So the realized-payoff table for **your** payoff becomes:

- If you play **A0**: vs (A0,A1,A2) = (10, 2, 2)
- If you play **A1**: vs (A0,A1,A2) = (20, 4, 4)
- If you play **A2**: vs (A0,A1,A2) = (20, 4, 10)

Key comparisons for you:
- **A2 strictly dominates A0** (20>10, 4>2, 10>2), so you should never play A0.
- **A2 weakly dominates A1** (ties at 20 and 4, but improves to 10 instead of 4 when the other also delegates).

So to maximize expected points (and to allow the best outcome 10 when the other also delegates, without sacrificing payoff otherwise), put all probability on **A2**.

response:
To maximize the total points received in this game, we first analyze the payoff matrix for the original actions (A0 and A1) and then incorporate the new action, A2 (Delegate to Mediator).

**Step 1: Construct the Payoff Matrix**
Based on the payoff description (where I am Player 2):
*   (P1=A0, P2=A0): (10, 10)
*   (P1=A0, P2=A1): (0, 20)
*   (P1=A1, P2=A0): (6, 2)
*   (P1=A1, P2=A1): (4, 4)

**Step 2: Incorporate the Delegate Action (A2)**
The mediator follows these rules:
*   If only 1 player delegates, it plays A1 for them.
*   If both players delegate, it plays A0 for both.

Expanded matrix (P1 is rows, P2 is columns):
*   **(P1=A0, P2=A2):** P2 delegates alone $\rightarrow$ Mediator plays A1 for P2. Result (A0, A1) $\rightarrow$ **(0, 20)**
*   **(P1=A1, P2=A2):** P2 delegates alone $\rightarrow$ Mediator plays A1 for P2. Result (A1, A1) $\rightarrow$ **(4, 4)**
*   **(P1=A2, P2=A0):** P1 delegates alone $\rightarrow$ Mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A0) $\rightarrow$ **(6, 2)**
*   **(P1=A2, P2=A1):** P1 delegates alone $\rightarrow$ Mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A1) $\rightarrow$ **(4, 4)**
*   **(P1=A2, P2=A2):** Both delegate $\rightarrow$ Mediator plays A0 for both. Result (A0, A0) $\rightarrow$ **(10, 10)**

**Complete Payoff Matrix (P1, P2):**
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 | P2: A2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) | (0, 20) |
| **P1: A1** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (4, 4) |
| **P1: A2** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (10, 10) |

**Step 3: Analyze Dominant Strategies and Nash Equilibria**
*   **For Player 2 (Me):**
    *   If P1 plays A0: A1 or A2 (20) > A0 (10).
    *   If P1 plays A1: A1 or A2 (4) > A0 (2).
    *   If P1 plays A2: A2 (10) > A1 (4) > A0 (2).
    *   Action A2 is a weakly dominant strategy for Player 2. It is always better than or equal to A1 and strictly better than A0.

*   **For Player 1 (Other Player):**
    *   If P2 plays A2: A2 (10) > A1 (4) > A0 (0).
    *   Player 1's best response to my weakly dominant strategy A2 is also A2.

**Step 4: Conclusion**
The Nash equilibrium (A2, A2) results in 10 points for each player. It is stable because neither player has an incentive to deviate. Specifically, if P2 chooses A2, P1 maximizes their payoff by also choosing A2. If P1 chooses A2, P2 maximizes their payoff by choosing A2. This is the Pareto optimal outcome among the Nash equilibria.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the basic game without the mediator

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 10 from A0, or 20 from A1 → **A1 is better**
- If P1 plays A1: I get 2 from A0, or 4 from A1 → **A1 is better**

So A1 weakly dominates A0 for me in the standard game.

## Step 2: Understand the mediator mechanism

The mediator plays:
- **A1** if only 1 player delegates
- **A0** if both players delegate

## Step 3: Analyze outcomes with the mediator

Let me consider what happens based on Player 1's choice:

**If Player 1 delegates:**
- If I don't delegate and play A1: Mediator plays A1 for P1 → outcome is (A1, A1) → I get **4 points**
- If I also delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both → outcome is (A0, A0) → I get **10 points**
- Delegating is strictly better (10 > 4)

**If Player 1 doesn't delegate:**
- If P1 plays A0 and I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me → I get **20 points**
- If P1 plays A0 and I play A1: I get **20 points** (same)
- If P1 plays A1 and I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me → I get **4 points**
- If P1 plays A1 and I play A1: I get **4 points** (same)
- Delegating is equally good as playing A1

## Step 4: Consider Player 1's incentives

Player 1 **proposed** this mediator. Looking at their payoffs:
- If both delegate: They get 10
- If neither delegates and I play A1 (my dominant strategy): They get at most 4
- The mediator allows them to coordinate on the mutually beneficial (10, 10) outcome

This strongly suggests Player 1 intends to delegate.

## Step 5: Determine optimal strategy

- Delegating is strictly better than not delegating if Player 1 delegates (10 vs 4)
- Delegating is at least as good in all other cases
- Player 1 has strong incentives to delegate (they proposed this mediator)
- Both delegating is the unique pure Nash equilibrium with this mediator

**Conclusion:** I should delegate with certainty.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

|         | Player 1 plays A0 | Player 1 plays A1 |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| I play A0 | 10                | 2                 |
| I play A1 | 20                | 4                 |

## Step 2: Analyze the base game without mediators

- For me (Player 2): A1 dominates A0 (20 > 10 if they play A0; 4 > 2 if they play A1)
- For Player 1: A1 is best response if I play A1 (4 > 0)
- Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → payoffs of (4, 4)

This is suboptimal since (A0, A0) would give us (10, 10).

## Step 3: Analyze what happens with the mediators

Both M1 and M2 have identical strategies:
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 4: Analyze the delegation game

Let me check all scenarios:

**Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → (10, 10) ✓

**Only Player 1 delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for P1; I choose A1 optimally → (4, 4)

**Only I delegate**: Mediator plays A1 for me; P1 chooses A1 optimally → (4, 4)

**Neither delegates**: Back to Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

This creates a delegation coordination game:

|                | P1 Delegates | P1 Doesn't |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| I Delegate     | 10, 10       | 4, 4       |
| I Don't        | 4, 4         | 4, 4       |

## Step 5: Evaluate the mediators

The (Delegate, Delegate) outcome is a Nash equilibrium and gives both players 10 points instead of 4. This is strictly better than playing without a mediator.

Since both M1 and M2 are identical and both enable this beneficial coordination, I should approve both.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Without the mediator, this game has two “coordination” pure equilibria: (A0,A0) giving me 10, and (A1,A1) giving me 4 (plus a mixed equilibrium). So the best possible outcome for me is 10.

With the mediator option A2:
- If **both** players choose **A2**, the mediator plays **A0** for both → outcome (A0,A0) → I get **10**.
- If I choose **A2** but the other player does **not**, the mediator plays **A1** for me:
  - vs other’s A0 → I get **6**
  - vs other’s A1 → I get **4**

So choosing **A2** has a big upside (it enables the best outcome 10 when the other also delegates), and it’s still not terrible if the other doesn’t delegate. Also, if I expect the other to delegate, then **my best response is definitely to delegate** (since deviating to A0 would give me 0 and deviating to A1 would give me 4).

Therefore, to maximize my expected points while supporting the best coordination outcome, I should delegate with probability 1.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game and Your Role**

You are **Player 2** in a two-player simultaneous-move game.

Actions: A0 or A1.

Payoff matrix (you are Player 2, opponent is Player 1):

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0                  | A1                  |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **A0**                         | (10, 10)            | (2, 6)              |
| **A1**                         | (20, 0)             | (4, 4)              |

So:
- If you play A0 and opponent A0 → you get 10
- If you play A1 and opponent A0 → you get 20
- If you play A0 and opponent A1 → you get 2
- If you play A1 and opponent A1 → you get 4

You want to **maximize your own points**.

---

### **Step 2: Consider the Delegation Mechanism and Mediator Options**

Two mediators are proposed. You will **approve or disapprove** of each via **approval voting**. The **winning mediator** is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

You choose **independently** whether to delegate (and thus use the mediator) or act on your own.

But note: **You are choosing which mediators to approve**, not which one to use. The final choice of mediator is determined by the approval voting process — **after both players vote**, and the one(s) with most approvals win, one chosen at random.

So your decision now is: **Which mediators do you want to support (approve)?**

But: **You are only allowed to vote on mediators** — not to pick. The outcome (which mediator is used) depends on the **approval vote**, not your choice of action.

Also: If you **delegate**, the mediator plays on your behalf. The mediator's action depends on **how many players** (1 or 2) delegate to it.

So, **the mediator’s behavior is contingent on the number of delegators**.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Mediator Rules**

#### **Mediator M1 (Player 1’s Proposal)**  
- If **1 player** delegates → plays A1  
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A0

#### **Mediator M2 (Player 2’s Proposal)**  
- If **1 player** delegates → plays A0  
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A1

---

### **Step 4: Think About Strategic Implications of Delegation**

If you **delegate**, you're not choosing A0/A1 yourself. The mediator decides **based on how many people delegate**.

So your effective outcome depends on:
- Whether you delegate
- Whether the other player delegates
- Which mediator wins (based on approval)

But note: **You are only deciding which mediators you approve**. You don’t get to choose which mediator is used. The one that has the most approvals is selected (randomly among those tied for most).

So your goal: **Maximize your expected points**, considering:
- The possibility that the winning mediator is M1 or M2
- Whether you delegate or not
- What the other player does

But the catch is: **You can’t control the mediator used (except by approving it)** — but you can increase the chance that a certain mediator wins via approval.

Also: You must **approve or disapprove** each mediator, independently.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze What Each Mediator Does in Each Scenario**

Let’s consider **what happens depending on how many players delegate**, and which mediator is used.

#### **Case 1: Only 1 player delegates (say, you do)**
- Median (M1) → plays A1
- Median (M2) → plays A0

#### **Case 2: Both players delegate**
- Median (M1) → plays A0
- Median (M2) → plays A1

Now, what matters is: **What is your payoff depending on what the mediator does and what the other player does (if they act independently)?**

But here’s the key: **If you delegate, you are not choosing your action.**
If the other player delegates, they are not choosing either.

So, outcomes depend on **who delegates**, and **what the mediator does**.

Let’s explore possible scenarios.

---

### **Step 6: Consider Your Own Strategy (Delegation or Not)**

You must **decide which mediators to approve**, but your **action** (delegate or not) is **not** part of this step — it's later.

But the **mediator’s behavior** affects your outcome **given your choice of action**.

So you need to **evaluate: Which mediators help you get more expected points, regardless of your own action?** But your approval affects **which mediator is chosen** — and that affects **what you get if you delegate**.

So let’s think about **what you would prefer** the mediator to do in various cases.

Let’s suppose you **delegate**. Then you will **not choose A0 or A1**, instead, the mediator will choose based on how many delegate.

So if you **delegated**, and the mediator chooses:
- A1 → your payoff depends on the other player's move
- A0 → same

Let’s consider **what you'd like the mediator to do**.

Suppose you are **delegating**:
- You want the **mediator to play A1** when you are the only delegate → so you get 20 if opponent plays A0
- But if you both delegate, the mediator plays A0 (M1) or A1 (M2)

But wait: if **both delegate**, then you don’t control your action — and your payoff depends on what **both mediators** do — but since you’re both delegating to the same mediator (only one wins), **both players are using the same mediator**.

So if you delegate and the mediator is M1:
- Both delegate → M1 plays A0 → **you play A0**, other player also plays A0 → **payoff (10,10)**

If mediator is M2:
- Both delegate → M2 plays A1 → both players play A1 → **payoff (4,4)**

Compare:
- M1: both delegate → you get 10
- M2: both delegate → you get 4

So **if both delegate**, you prefer **M1** (10 > 4)

Now, if **only you delegate** (opponent does not), then:
- You delegate → mediator plays (based on M1 or M2)
- Opponent plays independently (A0 or A1), which you don’t know yet.

But you can try to **infer** what opponent will do.

Wait — we are in a **pre-decision phase**: you’re only choosing **which mediators to approve** — you don’t know whether the other player will delegate or not, or what their strategy is.

But since the game is symmetric in knowledge, you must consider **what would be most beneficial given potential strategies**, especially **your own best response**.

But here’s a better approach:

You need to **approve mediators that you would prefer to be used**, **depending on your own behavior**.

But since you haven’t chosen whether to delegate or not yet, you need to think: **What would I want the mediator to do in different scenarios, assuming I may delegate?**

Let’s suppose you are **going to delegate** if the mediator is favorable.

But you can’t control that. You can only affect the **chance** that a good mediator is selected (by approving it).

So your **goal**: **Maximize your expected points**, assuming optimal behavior in the main game.

Thus, you need to **choose which mediators to approve**, with the goal of **increasing the likelihood of a good mediator being selected**, **given that you will act optimally in the main game**, possibly delegating.

---

### **Step 7: Consider What Each Mediator Does in Key Scenarios**

Let’s list the possible outcomes based on delegation and mediator.

#### Scenario A: **Only you delegate**
- Other player acts independently.
- Mediator decides your action.
- You get your payoff based on:
   - What the mediator plays (your action)
   - What the other player plays (unknown)

So your **payoff depends on what mediator does**.

- If mediator is M1 (plays A1 when 1 delegate) → you play A1
   - If other plays A0 → you get 20
   - If other plays A1 → you get 4

- If mediator is M2 (plays A0 when 1 delegate) → you play A0
   - If other plays A0 → you get 10
   - If other plays A1 → you get 2

So, **if only you delegate**, you prefer M1 (A1) **if** you think the other player is likely to play A0.

But if the other player plays A1 with high probability, you get 4 with M1, but 2 with M2 → still better to use M1.

Let’s compare:
- M1 (A1), other A0: 20 vs 4
- M1 (A1), other A1: 4 vs 2
- So M1 always gives higher or equal payoff when only you delegate

→ **M1 better than M2 if only you delegate**

So **you prefer M1 over M2 when you’re the only delegate**

#### Scenario B: **Both players delegate**
- Mediator plays for both
- What do they play?
   - M1: plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 10
   - M2: plays A1 → both play A1 → you get 4

→ You prefer **M1** (10 > 4)

So **in both scenarios** (1 or 2 delegates), **you prefer M1** to M2.

Wait — is that true?

- Only you delegate: M1 → A1; M2 → A0
   - You get 20 if opponent A0, 4 if opponent A1
   - M2 gives 10 or 2 → worse in both cases?

Let’s suppose opponent plays A0 with probability p.

Then:
- With M1 (only you delegate): expected payoff = 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4
- With M2: 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2

Compare: 16p + 4 vs 8p + 2 → difference = 8p + 2 > 0 always → M1 better

Now both delegate:
- M1: you get 10
- M2: you get 4 → M1 better

So in **every case**, you **prefer M1** over M2.

Therefore, **you should approve M1** and **disapprove M2**.

But wait — is that right?

Let’s think: **What if you don’t delegate?**

Then your action is A0 or A1, and you get the payoff as per the matrix.

But if **you are considering delegating**, you care about the mediator.

The mediator you **approve** is only relevant **if it is selected**.

And since **you prefer M1 in every possible outcome**, you want M1 to be selected.

Therefore, to increase the chance that M1 is chosen, you should **approve M1**.

And to avoid helping M2 win, you should **disapprove M2**.

But: approval voting — only the **maximum number of approvals** matter.

So if you approve only M1, and the other player approves only M2, then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 1 approval → tie → winning mediator chosen at random → 50% M1, 50% M2

But if **you approve M1 and M2**, then both have at least 1, and if other player approves only one, then:
- If you approve both, even if other approves only M2, then M1 has 1, M2 has 2 → M2 wins
- If other approves only M1, M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins

So **if you approve both**, you’re helping M2 as much as M1.

But if you **approve only M1**, and other approves only M2, then **tie**, random selection — you get 50% chance of M1.

But if you **approve only M1**, and other player approves **only M1**, then M1 wins (2 vs 0) → good.

But you don’t know what the other player will do.

So you need to **model incentives**.

But here’s the key: **You are trying to maximize your expected payoff**, assuming both players act rationally.

But the **other player** is also trying to maximize **their own points**.

So let’s think **from the other player's perspective**.

---

### **Step 8: Think Like the Other Player (Player 1)**

What would Player 1 prefer?

Player 1’s payoff matrix (switch roles):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|--------|---------|---------|
| A0     | (10,10) | (2,6)   |
| A1     | (20,0) | (4,4)   |

So Player 1 prefers:
- A1 if P2 plays A0 → gets 20
- A0 if P2 plays A1 → gets 10
- A1 if both play A1 → gets 4

So they prefer **A1** over A0 if P2 plays A0.

But they get only 0 if they play A1 and P2 plays A0.

Now for **mediators**:

- M1: if 1 delegate → A1; if 2 → A0
- M2: if 1 → A0; if 2 → A1

So suppose Player 1 is **delegating**.

- If only they delegate: M1 → A1; M2 → A0
- If both delegate: M1 → A0; M2 → A1

Now, what would Player 1 prefer?

**Only they delegate**:
- M1 → A1 → if P2 plays A0 → 20; if P2 plays A1 → 4
- M2 → A0 → if P2 plays A0 → 10; if P2 plays A1 → 2

So M1 gives 20 or 4; M2 gives 10 or 2 → M1 better if P2 plays A0

If P2 plays A1, M1 gives 4, M2 gives 2 → M1 still better

So **Player 1 also prefers M1 in solo case**

**Both delegate**:
- M1 → both play A0 → P1 gets 10
- M2 → both play A1 → P1 gets 4

→ P1 prefers M1

So **Player 1 also prefers M1 over M2 in all scenarios**

That means **both players prefer M1 to M2**

Therefore, **both players will prefer to approve M1**

And **disapprove M2**

But wait — could one player prefer M2?

Let’s suppose you (P2) approve only M1.

Player 1 (P1) also approves M1.

Then both mediators have at least 1 — but if P1 only approves M1, and you only approve M1, then:
- M1: 2 approvals
- M2: 0 → M1 wins

Perfect.

But if P1 approves only M2, then M2 has 1, M1 has 1 → tie → random selection → 50% M1, 50% M2

Now, if you approved only M1, and P1 approved only M2 → tie → 50% M1

But since **both of you** prefer M1, you both want M1 to win.

Therefore, to **maximize the chance that M1 is selected**, you should **approve M1**, and **not approve M2**, so you don’t **help M2 win**.

But what if both approve M1? Then M1 wins.

If you approve M1 and M2, and P1 approves only M1 → M1 gets 2, M2 gets 1 → M1 wins

But if P1 approves only M2 → then M1:1, M2:2 → M2 wins — **bad for you**.

So if you approve **both**, and P1 approves only M2 → M2 wins → you get less

But if you approve only M1, and P1 approves only M2 → tie → random → 50% M1, 50% M2

→ You get **50% chance of M1** (good), **50% chance of M2** (bad)

But if you approve **only M1**, and P1 approves **M1**, then M1 wins → perfect

Now, what if P1 approves both? Then M1:2, M2:2 → tie → random → 50-50

Same as above.

But **you want to maximize the chance of M1**

So, if you **approve only M1**, then:
- If P1 approves M1 → M1 wins (2-0) → good
- If P1 approves only M2 → tie → 50% M1 → decent
- If P1 approves both → tie → 50% M1 → same

So in **all cases**, you have **at least 50% chance of M1**

But if you approve **both**, then:
- If P1 approves only M1 → M1:2, M2:1 → M1 wins → good
- If P1 approves only M2 → M1:1, M2:2 → M2 wins → bad (you get 0)
- If P1 approves both → tie → 50-50

So **your risk is higher**: if P1 approves only M2, M2 wins → bad for you

But if you approve only M1, **M2 never wins** unless P1 approves M2 and no one else approves M1 — but you do — so M1 has at least 1

The **only way M2 wins is if M2 has strictly more approvals than M1**

But M1 has your approval → at least 1

So M2 only wins if it has at least 2 approvals and M1 has fewer

So if you approve M1, M1 has at least 1

M2 wins only if M2 has **2** approvals and M1 has **0** — impossible, since you approve M1

So **M2 can never win** if you approve M1

**Even if P1 approves only M2**, M2 has 1, M1 has 1 → tie → random → 50% M1, 50% M2

So **M2 never wins with certainty** if you approve M1

But **if you approve M2**, then M2 can win if:
- P1 approves M2, and you approve M2
- And M1 has fewer approvals

For example, if P1 approves only M2, and you approve M2 and M1 → M1:2, M2:2 → tie → 50% M2

But if P1 approves only M2, and you approve only M2 → M2:2, M1:0 → M2 wins → **you get M2**, which you don't want

Wait — if you approve only M2, and P1 approves only M2 → M2 wins → you get M2 → bad

But if you approve only M1, and P1 approves only M2 → tie → 50% M1 → better

So **approving M1 gives you protection** against M2 winning with certainty.

**Approving M2 makes it possible for M2 to win**, which you don’t want.

Therefore, the **safe and best strategy** is to **approve only M1**, and **disapprove M2**.

Because:
- M1 is better in all scenarios
- Approving M1 increases the chance M1 wins
- Approving M2 increases the chance M2 wins, which you oppose
- Approving only M1 **prevents M2 from winning with certainty**, and **ensures M2 only wins if tie**, which is a 50% risk

But by approving only M1, you **never** allow M2 to win unless there's a tie — which is acceptable.

Whereas if you approve M2, you **enable** M2 to win in some cases.

Therefore, **you should approve M1 and disapprove M2**

---

### **Conclusion**

You should **approve M1 (Player 1’s mediator)** because:
- It gives you better payoffs in all cases (whether one or two delegate)
- It is preferred by both players
- Approving it increases the chance it wins
- Disapproving M2 prevents it from being selected with certainty
- Approval voting allows M2 to win only in ties, but you risk M2 winning otherwise

Thus, optimal strategy: **Approve M1, disapprove M2**

If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Model the mediator as action **A2**. Then the realized outcomes involving delegation are:

- (A2, A2) ⇒ mediator sees 2 delegators ⇒ plays (A0, A0) ⇒ you get **10**
- (A2, A0) ⇒ you delegate alone ⇒ you play A1 vs A0 ⇒ you get **6**
- (A2, A1) ⇒ you delegate alone ⇒ you play A1 vs A1 ⇒ you get **4**
- (A0, A2) ⇒ opponent delegates alone ⇒ they play A1 ⇒ you get **0**
- (A1, A2) ⇒ opponent delegates alone ⇒ (A1, A1) ⇒ you get **4**

Now check best responses:

- If the other player chooses **A2**, your payoffs are:  
  A0 → 0, A1 → 4, **A2 → 10**. So your best response is **A2**.
- Symmetrically, if you choose **A2**, the other player’s best response is also **A2** (it yields them 10 vs alternatives).

So (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium and gives you the highest payoff against an A2-playing opponent. Therefore, you should delegate with probability 1.

response:
Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the game without delegation**

We are Player 2. The game structure is a two-player simultaneous move game with the following payoffs (Player 2's payoff in each case):

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 10          | 10                     |
| A1          | A0                     | 20          | 0                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 2           | 6                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 4           | 4                      |

This is a classic non-zero-sum game. The other player is Player 1.

But now there’s a **twist**: we can **delegate** our move to a **mediator** (action A2).

---

### **Step 2: Understand the mediator's behavior**

The mediator behaves as follows:
- If **1 player** delegates to it → it plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate to it → it plays **A0**

So the mediator’s action depends on **how many** players choose A2.

Note: We are Player 2. The mediator was proposed by Player 1 and approved. So it exists and will act as described.

---

### **Step 3: Define the full action space**

We can choose:
- A0: Play A0 independently
- A1: Play A1 independently
- A2: Delegate to mediator

So our strategy is a probability distribution over A0, A1, A2.

Let’s define:
- $ p_0 $: probability of choosing A0
- $ p_1 $: probability of choosing A1
- $ p_2 $: probability of choosing A2

So $ p_0 + p_1 + p_2 = 100 $ (as percentages)

Player 1 has the same choice. Let’s suppose Player 1 uses a strategy:
- $ q_0 $: probability of A0
- $ q_1 $: probability of A1
- $ q_2 $: probability of A2

We need to find a **best response** as Player 2 to **some strategy of Player 1**, but since we are trying to **maximize our expected payoff over repeated rounds** and no information about Player 1's strategy is given, we must assume **we are in a symmetric setting** or that the game will be played once and we want to **maximize expected payoff based on a rational equilibrium reasoning**.

But the twist is that **Player 1 has proposed and selected the mediator**, so perhaps they have an incentive to influence the outcome.

Wait: **Player 1 proposed the mediator**, and it was approved. That suggests that Player 1 may have some interest in the mediator's behavior.

But more importantly: **We are to choose a strategy to **maximize our expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 chooses **their** strategy strategically.

But since both players are rational and the game is symmetric in structure (except for the mediator being proposed by Player 1), we should consider **Nash equilibrium** or **best response**.

However, we are only playing **one round**, and we must pick a **probability distribution over A0, A1, A2**.

But to solve this optimally, we should consider **what Player 1 would do** if they are rational.

Let’s reframe: Since we don't know Player 1’s strategy, but we are to **maximize our expected payoff**, we must assume Player 1 is also rational and will pick a strategy to maximize their own payoff.

Therefore, we are looking for a **Nash equilibrium** of this extended game with the delegation option.

Alternatively, since the problem says “maximize your total points,” and we are to choose a strategy **without knowing Player 1’s move**, we must assume we’re choosing the strategy that is **best in expectation under equilibrium conditions**.

So let’s model the full game.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze possible outcomes based on delegation**

The mediator’s action depends on **how many players choose A2**.

So three cases:
- Case 1: 0 players delegate → mediator not used
- Case 2: 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- Case 3: 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

Let’s define Player 2’s strategy as $ (p_0, p_1, p_2) $, and Player 1’s as $ (q_0, q_1, q_2) $.

But now we must consider **what Player 1 would do**.

Let’s analyze from the perspective of **Player 1**, since they proposed the mediator.

They know the mediator will play:
- A1 if only one player delegates
- A0 if both delegate

So Player 1 might have an incentive to induce a certain behavior.

But our goal is **to maximize Player 2’s expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 chooses rationally.

So we must look for a **Nash equilibrium** of this game.

Let’s consider possible equilibria.

---

### **Step 5: Consider pure strategy equilibria**

Try to see if there are any pure strategy Nash equilibria.

#### Case 1: Both play A0
- No delegation.
- Payoffs: (10, 10)
- Can Player 2 deviate? If Player 2 plays A1 instead: (A1, A0) → (20, 0) → better for Player 2. So not equilibrium.

#### Case 2: Both play A1
- (A1, A1) → (4, 4)
- Player 2 can deviate to A0: (A0, A1) → (2, 6): worse for Player 2. So no incentive.
- Player 1: if deviates to A0: (A1, A0) → (20, 0): Player 1 gets 0 now → bad. So both have no incentive? Wait.

Player 1 gets 4 when both play A1.
If Player 1 deviates to A0: (A1, A0) → Player 1 gets 20 → **better**.

So Player 1 wants to deviate. So (A1, A1) is **not** a Nash equilibrium.

#### Case 3: Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 plays A1
- (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 2, Player 1 gets 6
- Player 2 wants to deviate to A1: (A1, A1) → 4 → better, so yes. Not equilibrium.

#### Case 4: Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 plays A0
- (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0
- Player 1 wants to deviate to A1: (A1, A1) → gets 4 → better than 0 → yes. So not equilibrium.

So no pure strategy equilibrium **without delegation**.

Now consider **delegation**.

---

### **Step 6: Explore delegation equilibria**

Let’s suppose **both players choose A2** (delegate).

Then **2 players delegate**, so mediator plays **A0**.

So both players effectively play A0.

Payoff: (10, 10)

Now, can either player deviate unilaterally?

Check Player 2: if Player 2 deviates to A0, and Player 1 still plays A2 (so still 2 delegators), mediator plays A0 → Player 2 plays A0 → same outcome → gain 10. Same as before.

But Player 2 could deviate to A1: same, mediator plays A0, so Player 2 plays A1 → (A1, A0) → Player 2 gets **20** → much better!

So if Player 1 is delegating, Player 2 can **deviate to A1** and get 20 instead of 10.

So (A2, A2) is **not** a Nash equilibrium.

Now, suppose **only one player delegates**, say Player 2 delegates (A2), and Player 1 plays A0.

Then: only Player 2 delegates, so mediator plays **A1** → so Player 2 plays A1.

Player 1 plays A0.

So outcome: (A1, A0) → Player 2 gets **20**, Player 1 gets **0**

Now, would Player 1 want to switch?

If Player 1 switches to A2, then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → outcome: (A0, A0) → both get 10.

Player 1 would go from 0 to 10 → **better**.

So Player 1 prefers to switch.

So (A2, A0) is not equilibrium.

Similarly, (A2, A1): Player 2 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 2 plays A1. Player 1 plays A1. Outcome: (A1, A1) → payoffs (4,4)

Player 1 gets 4, but if they switch to A0: (A1, A0) → Player 1 gets 0 → worse. If they switch to A2: now both delegate → mediator plays A0 → (A0, A0) → Player 1 gets 10 → better! So yes, would want to switch.

So (A2, A1) is not equilibrium.

Now try: **Player 1 delegates (A2), Player 2 plays A0**

Then: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so Player 2 plays A1? Wait: no.

Clarify:

- Player 1 chooses **A2** → delegates
- Player 2 chooses **A0** → does not delegate

Then: only one player (Player 1) delegates → mediator plays **A1**

So **Player 1** plays A1 (via mediator), Player 2 plays A0.

Outcome: (A0, A1) → Player 2 gets **2**, Player 1 gets **6**

Now, can Player 2 deviate? If Player 2 goes to A1: then both play A1 → (A1, A1) → Player 2 gets 4 → better than 2 → yes, so wants to deviate.

If Player 1 deviates to A0: (A0, A0) → Player 1 gets 10 → better than 6 → also wants to deviate.

So not equilibrium.

How about if Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 plays A2 → as above → Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0 → Player 1 wants to deviate to A2 → then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → Player 1 gets 10 > 0 → so yes.

So no pure strategy equilibrium?

Wait — what if **only one player delegates**, and the other does not, and the outcome is stable?

But in all cases, the non-delegating player can benefit from deviating.

Wait — suppose **Player 1 is going to delegate**, but Player 2 does not.

Then Player 1 gets A1 via mediator, Player 2 plays A0 → Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0.

Then Player 1 can switch to A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get 10 → better than 0.

So Player 1 wants to delegate too.

But then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → outcome (A0, A0) → both get 10.

But now, Player 2: if they **switch to A1**, while Player 1 is still delegating, so only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 (via mediator) plays A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → Player 2 gets 4 → worse than 10.

But if Player 2 switches to A0 → same as before → gets 10.

But earlier we had: if both delegate, mediator plays A0 → (A0, A0) → 10 each.

Now, if Player 2 switches to A1 → now only one delegate (Player 1) → mediator plays A1 → so Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → Player 2 gets 4 → worse than 10.

So Player 2 has **no incentive** to deviate.

Player 1: if they deviate to not delegate → say plays A0 → then now only Player 2 is delegating → so mediator plays A1 → Player 2 plays A1 (via mediator), Player 1 plays A0 → outcome: (A1, A0) → Player 1 gets **0** → worse than 10.

If Player 1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → gets 4 → worse than 10.

So Player 1 has no incentive to deviate.

So **(A2, A2)** — both delegates — leads to outcome (A0, A0), payoffs (10,10), and **no player has incentive to deviate unilaterally**.

Wait — earlier I said if Player 2 deviates to A1 while Player 1 is delegating, then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → Player 2 gets 4 → worse than 10.

Yes. So Player 2 is worse off.

Similarly, Player 1: if they deviate to A0 or A1, gets only 0 or 4, worse than 10.

So **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium**!

And the outcome is (A0, A0) → 10 each.

Is there another equilibrium?

Suppose Player 1 delegates, Player 2 does not. But as above, Player 1 would want to switch to A2 to get 10 instead of 0. So no.

Or suppose Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 plays A1 → (A1, A0) → Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0. Player 1 can switch to A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → Player 1 gets 10 > 0 → so wants to deviate.

So only equilibrium we found is both delegate → (A0, A0) → 10 each.

But is there another?

Wait — what if only **one player delegates**, and the other plays in a way that stabilizes?

Suppose Player 2 delegates, Player 1 plays A0 → outcome: (A1, A0) → Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0.

Player 1 wants to switch to A2 → then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → Player 1 gets 10 → better → so will switch.

Similarly, if Player 1 delegates, Player 2 plays A0 → Player 1 gets 6, Player 2 gets 2 → Player 2 wants to switch to A1 → (A1, A1) → gets 4 → better → or even worse? A1 gives 4 > 2 → so yes.

But if Player 2 plays A1, then (A1, A1) — but only if Player 1 delegates → then mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → Player 2 gets 4.

But if Player 2 then switches to A2? Then Player 1 is already delegating → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → Player 2 plays A1 → same as before? Wait.

Wait — if Player 2 switches to A2 (delegate), then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → so Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 plays A0 → (A0, A0) → Player 2 gets 10 → better than 4!

So Player 2 would prefer to **join the delegation** and get 10.

So deviation to A2 gives 10 > 4 → so yes, Player 2 will deviate.

So only stable point is **both delegate**.

But is this the only equilibrium? Probably.

But let’s think about **mixed strategies**.

But the question is: we must choose a strategy (probability distribution) to **maximize expected payoff**, assuming the other player is rational and plays optimally.

In the only Nash equilibrium we've found, both choose A2, leading to 10 points.

But can we do better?

Suppose we **deviate from equilibrium** — if Player 1 is playing A2, and we play A1, we get only 4.

But if we think Player 1 might not play A2...

Wait — if we choose to **not delegate**, and Player 1 might not delegate either, maybe we can get a better outcome.

But since we are to **maximize expected payoff**, and we don’t know Player 1’s move, we need to consider what they would do.

But in equilibrium: **both play A2**, so we get 10.

But is there a way to **exploit** or do better?

Wait — suppose we **randomize**, and Player 1 **anticipates**.

But let’s think: is **(A2, A2)** the only equilibrium?

Suppose Player 1 plays A1 for sure.

Can Player 2 do better?

If Player 1 plays A1, then:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → (A0, A1) → 2 points
- If Player 2 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → 4 points
- If Player 2 plays A2 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so Player 2 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → 4 points

So best is A1 or A2 → 4

But if Player 2 plays A2, and Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 gets 4.

But if Player 1 is playing A1, why would Player 2 want to delegate? It gives same payoff.

But if Player 2 never delegates, we are playing (A0, A1) or (A1, A1)

But suppose we are trying to **deviate to A2 to get A0 only if both delegate**.

But Player 1 might not cooperate.

But in **equilibrium**, Player 1 will play A2 to avoid getting 0 in other cases.

But is there another equilibrium?

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 for sure.

Then:
- Player 2: A0 → (10,10); A1 → (20,0); A2 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → Player 2 plays A1 → (A1, A0) → 20 points

So Player 2 would prefer A2 → 20 points

So if Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 plays A2 → gets 20

But now, would Player 1 want to stick to A0?

If Player 2 plays A2 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A0 → Player 2 plays A1 → (A1, A0) → Player 1 gets **0**

But if Player 1 switches to A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → (A0, A0) → Player 1 gets 10 — better than 0

So Player 1 will want to switch

So (A0, A2) is not equilibrium

Similarly, if Player 1 plays A1, we saw Player 2 can get 4, but Player 1 might want to deviate to A2 to get 10

So the only **stable** outcome seems to be **both delegate**, leading to (10,10)

But is there a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**?

Let’s suppose that **Player 1 is randomizing**, and we find a best response.

But this might be complicated.

Alternatively — notice that the **mediator's rule** is:  
- 1 delegate → A1  
- 2 delegates → A0

So if **both delegate**, we get A0

If only one delegate, we get A1

Now, **Player 2’s objective**: maximize expected payoff.

Suppose we believe **Player 1** will **play A2** (delegate) with high probability.

Then if we play A2, we both delegate → we play A0 → get 10

If we play A1, only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → we play A1 → (A1, A1) → get 4

If we play A0 → same → (A0, A1) → get 2

So best is A2 -> 10

But if we think Player 1 is **not** delegating, then:

If Player 1 plays A0:
- We play A0: 10
- A1: 20
- A2: mediator plays A1 → we play A1 → (A1, A0) → 20

So best is A1 or A2 — both give 20

Similarly, if Player 1 plays A1:
- We play A0: 2
- A1: 4
- A2: mediator plays A1 → we play A1 → (A1, A1) → 4

So best is A2 or A1 — both give 4

So if Player 1 is playing A0, we can get 20 (with A1 or A2)

If Player 1 is playing A1, we get only 4

But Player 1, being rational, **would not play A1** if we can get 20 and they get 0.

Indeed, if Player 1 plays A1 and we play A2, they get 4 — but if they instead play A0, and we play A2, they get 0 — worse.

So if we are going to play A2, Player 1 gets 0 if they play A0, 6 if they play A1, 10 if they play A2.

So they prefer A2 — 10.

So they will play A2.

Similarly, if we play A1, they get 0 if they play A0, 4 if A1, 10 if A2 — so they prefer A2.

If we play A0, they get 10 if A0, 0 if A1, 10 if A2 — so indifferent between A0 and A2, prefer A2 over A1.

So **in all cases, Player 1 will choose A2 (delegate)** because:
- If we play A0: they prefer A2 (10) over A0 (10) equally? But maybe they prefer A0 if 10 = 10.

But if Player 1 plays A2, and we play A0 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so Player 1 plays A1 → (A0, A1) → Player 1 gets 6

Wait — this is important.

Let’s be precise.

**Case: Player 1 plays A2 (delegate), Player 2 plays A0**

Then: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so **Player 1 plays A1**, Player 2 plays A0 → outcome: (A0, A1) → Player 1 gets **6**

Player 1 could play A0 instead: then no one delegates → they play A0, we play A0 → (A0, A0) → Player 1 gets **10**

10 > 6, so **better** to play A0 than A2!

Ah! **This is critical.**

So even though Player 1 proposed the mediator, if they delegate, they get only 6 if we play A0.

But if they don’t delegate (play A0), they get 10.

So **they would prefer not to delegate if we play A0**.

Similarly, if we play A1, and Player 1 delegates → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets 4

But if Player 1 plays A0 instead → (A1, A0) → Player 1 gets 0 → worse

So if we play A1, Player 1 gets 4 if they delegate, 0 if not — so they prefer to delegate.

Similarly, if we play A2, and Player 1 delegates → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → (A0, A0) → Player 1 gets 10

If Player 1 plays A0 (don't delegate) while we delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A0, we play A1 → (A1, A0) → Player 1 gets 0 — worse than 10

So if we delegate, Player 1 prefers to delegate too.

So only when **we play A0** does Player 1 prefer to **not delegate** (A0), because they get 10 > 6.

So Player 1's best response depends on us.

Let’s define Player 1's best response to our choice:

- If we play **A0**:
  - If Player 1 plays A0 → (A0, A0) → 10
  - If Player 1 plays A1 → (A0, A1) → 6
  - If Player 1 plays A2 → (A0, A1) → 6
  So best is A0 → 10

- If we play **A1**:
  - A0 → (A1, A0) → 0
  - A1 → (A1, A1) → 4
  - A2 → (A1, A1) → 4
  So best is A1 or A2 → 4

- If we play **A2**:
  - A0 → (A1, A0) → 0
  - A1 → (A1, A1) → 4
  - A2 → (A0, A0) → 10
  So best is A2 → 10

Therefore, Player 1’s best response:
- If we play A0 → Player 1 plays A0
- If we play A1 → Player 1 plays A1 or A2
- If we play A2 → Player 1 plays A2

Now, our best response to each of Player 1’s responses:

If Player 1 plays A0:
- We play A0 → 10
- A1 → 20
- A2 → 2 (because only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → we play A1 → (A1, A0) → 20)

Wait:

If we play A2, and Player 1 plays A0 → only one delegate (us) → mediator plays A1 → we play A1 → (A1, A0) → we get 20

But if we play A1, we get 20 too.

So best is A1 or A2 → 20

Similarly, if Player 1 plays A1:
- A0 → 2
- A1 → 4
- A2 → 4 (since only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → we play A1 → (A1, A1) → 4)

So best is A1 or A2 → 4

If Player 1 plays A2:
- A0 → 10 (only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → we play A1 → (A1, A0) → we get 20? Wait no)

Wait: if Player 1 plays A2 (delegate), and we play A0:
- only one delegate (Player 1) → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1, we play A0 → (A0, A1) → we get **2**

If we play A1: (A1, A1) → 4

If we play A2: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → (A0, A0) → we get 10

So best is A2 → 10

Now, let's find equilibrium.

Suppose we play A2 (delegate).

Then Player 1 best response: A2 → get 10

Then our best response: A2 → 10

So (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium → payoff (10,10)

Suppose we play A0.

Then Player 1 best response: A0

Then our best response: A0 or A2 → A0 gives 10, A2 gives 20 (because (A1, A0) → 20)

So we would want to deviate to A2

So not equilibrium.

Suppose we play A1.

Then Player 1 best response: A1 or A2 → 4

Suppose Player 1 plays A1.

Then we get 4.

Can we deviate? If we play A0: get 2, worse. A2: get 4, same. So indifferent, but no incentive to deviate.

But Player 1: if we play A1, Player 1 can play A1 or A2 → both give 4.

But if Player 1 plays A2, and we play A1 → we get 4, but if they play A1, same.

But Player 1 might prefer to play A2 to avoid being exploited?

But no difference.

However, if we play A1, and Player 1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → 4

But if Player 1 plays A2, same.

But is there a way for us to get higher?

Only with A0 or A2.

But if we stick to A1, we get 4, but if we deviate to A2, and Player 1 plays A1, we get 4 — same.

But if Player 1 plays A0, we get 20.

But if we play A1, and Player 1 plays A0, we get 20? No:

If we play A1, Player 1 plays A0 → (A1, A0) → we get 20

Yes! So if we play A1, and Player 1 plays A0, we get 20.

But from above, if we play A1, Player 1’s best response is A1 or A2, not A0 (because they get 0 if they play A0).

So Player 1 will not play A0 if we play A1.

So in equilibrium, if we play A1, Player 1 plays A1 or A2, so we get 4.

So we are stuck with 4.

But if we play A2, and Player 1 plays A2, we get 10 — better than 4.

So better to play A2.

And (A2, A2) is equilibrium.

Is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?

But in the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium, we get 10.

Can we do better with mixed strategy?

Suppose we play a mixed strategy.

But if Player 1 is playing A2 with probability 1, then:
- Our expected payoff:
  - A0: Player 1 plays A2 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → we play A1 → (A1, A0) → we get 20? Wait

No: if we play A0, and Player 1 plays A2 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1, we play A0 → (A0, A1) → we get **2**

If we play A1: (A1, A1) → 4

If we play A2: (A0, A0) → 10

So best is A2 → 10

So we should play A2.

Similarly, if Player 1 is playing A0, then:
- A0: 10
- A1: 20
- A2: 20

So best is A1 or A2.

But Player 1 won't play A0 if we play A2, as we saw.

To maximize our expected payoff, we need a strategy that works well against Player 1's best response.

But in equilibrium, Player 1 will play A2.

And if Player 1 plays A2, our best choice is A2 → 10.

If we play A1, we get 4.

So best is to play A2.

Therefore, **the strategy that maximizes our expected payoff, assuming rational opponent, is to play A2 (delegate) with probability 100%**.

This leads to both delegating, mediator plays A0, both play A0, we get 10.

And no better outcome is possible in equilibrium.

Moreover, in any other strategy, we get less or risk worse.

For example, if we play A1, and Player 1 might play A1 or A2, we get only 4.

So we prefer 10.

Therefore, our optimal strategy is to **always delegate**.

### **Final Answer**

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P2
response:
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Structure**

We are in a two-player game where:
- Each player independently chooses a strategy: A0, A1, or A2 (Delegate to Mediator).
- The choice is probabilistic: we must assign probabilities to A0, A1, A2.
- The **payoff depends on the actual actions taken** (not just the choice of strategy, because delegation leads to a third party playing).

We are **Player 2**, and we care about **maximizing our expected points**.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Payoff Matrix (Without Delegation)**

First, consider the base game without delegation (i.e., when both players play A0 or A1). The payoff matrix (Player 2's points, since we are Player 2) is:

|         | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| P2: A0  | 10           | 2            |
| P2: A1  | 20           | 4            |

So:
- (A0, A0): P2 gets 10
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 20
- (A0, A1): P2 gets 2
- (A1, A1): P2 gets 4

This is a classic coordination-type game with incentives to mismatch.

---

### **Step 3: Understand Delegation to the Mediator**

- **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**
- The mediator plays:
  - If **1 player** delegates → Mediator plays **A1**
  - If **2 players** delegate → Mediator plays **A0**

So:
- If only **you** delegate (you = A2, player 1 = A0 or A1): mediator plays A1 → you get the payoff as if you played A1.
- If **both** delegate: mediator plays A0 → you get the payoff as if you played A0.
- If **neither** delegates: both choose A0 or A1, no mediator involved.

Important: Delegation is **not** an action choice in the usual sense. It’s a way to outsource your move. The **mediator's action depends on how many players delegate**.

---

### **Step 4: Determine the Possible Scenarios Based on Delegation Behavior**

We must consider all combinations of decisions:

Let’s define:
- Let **p** = probability that **you** (Player 2) choose A2 (Delegate).
- Let **q** = probability that **Player 1** chooses A2 (Delegate).

Since we are choosing your strategy, we must find optimal p (and also your mix over A0 and A1, if needed). But the problem allows mixed strategies across A0, A1, A2.

We need to pick probabilities:
- $ x $: P(A0)
- $ y $: P(A1)
- $ z $: P(A2)
- $ x + y + z = 100 $

But note: if you delegate (A2), your action is determined by the mediator’s rule based on how many delegates.

So the key is that your **effective action** depends on:
- Whether you delegate.
- Whether Player 1 delegates.

Let’s define the possible cases.

---

### **Step 5: Enumerate the Four Delegation Scenarios**

1. **Neither delegates** → you play A0/A1 with your chosen probabilities; Player 1 plays A0/A1 with their (possibly mixed) strategy.
2. **Only you delegate** → you get A1 (since only 1 delegate), and Player 1 plays A0/A1 (if they play A0 or A1).
3. **Only Player 1 delegates** → Player 1 gets A1 (only one delegate), and you play A0/A1.
4. **Both delegate** → mediator plays A0 (2 delegates), so both players effectively play A0.

Let’s analyze expected payoff in each case from your (Player 2) perspective.

But to proceed, we must make assumptions about **Player 1's behavior**, since we don't know it.

Wait — this is a **decision-making game with another player**, and we are to **maximize our points**.

But **we don’t get to observe or control Player 1's choice**. So we must assume they are rational too, and we must find a **Nash equilibrium** or a **best response** to what they might do.

But the instruction says:

> "Choose a probability distribution over the provided actions each round."

It doesn't specify whether we are trying to find an equilibrium or just optimize against a fixed opponent.

However, since the other player is also making a decision, and the game is symmetric in structure (though not symmetric in payoffs), **we should look for a symmetric equilibrium**, or at least compute **best response** to plausible strategies.

But note: The mediator was proposed by Player 1, and we don’t know how they will behave. But since the mediator’s action depends on count of delegates, and Player 1 gets to choose whether to delegate, they will likely try to optimize their own payoff.

This suggests we need to **solve for a Nash equilibrium**, where both players pick strategies knowing what happens if they delegate.

Alternatively, we might consider that **if both players are rational and symmetric**, we can search for a symmetric equilibrium.

But the payoffs are **not symmetric**, so the game is asymmetric. Let’s confirm.

From your (Player 2) point of view:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

Player 1’s payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A1, A1): 4

So the game is **not symmetric**.

Player 1 prefers to coordinate on A0 (with you), and gets 0 when playing A1 while you play A0 (which is bad for them), while you get 20 in that case.

So Player 1 hates it when you play A0 and they play A1. But you love it.

So **misalignment of preferences**.

Player 1 will likely avoid playing A1 if they think you're playing A0.

But let’s not guess — let's think strategically.

We are to pick a **mixed strategy** (probabilities over A0, A1, A2) to **maximize our expected payoff**, **assuming the other player is also rational**, and thus will play a best response to our strategy (or we are in a symmetric equilibrium).

But the setup doesn’t specify that we are in equilibrium. It says “you are playing a decision-making game”, and “maximize your total points”.

So perhaps we are to **choose a strategy** that maximizes **our expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 plays **optimally** in response? Or vice versa?

But that leads to an infinite regress.

Best approach: **Search for a Nash equilibrium** where each player plays a mixed strategy (possibly over A0, A1, A2), and both are best responding to each other.

But we might simplify by **considering delegation as a strategic tool**.

Let’s explore whether **delegation always gives an advantage**.

---

### **Step 6: Evaluate Delegation as a Strategic Option**

Let’s look at the **mediator’s rule**:

- If **1 player delegates**, mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players delegate**, mediator plays **A0**

So if **you delegate alone**, mediator plays A1 → you get the payoff as if you played A1.

If **both delegate**, mediator plays A0 → you get payoff as if you played A0.

So:

- If **only you delegate**, you get what you'd get from A1 vs Player 1's chosen action.
- If **both delegate**, you get what you'd get from A0 vs A0 → 10 points.

So delegation can be a way to force a certain outcome.

But whether it's beneficial depends on what Player 1 does.

Suppose you **always delegate** (A2: 100%). What happens?

Then the mediator sees 1 delegate (you), so plays **A1**.

So you play A1.

Player 1 can choose to:
- Play A0: then (A1 vs A0) → you get **20**, they get 0
- Play A1: then (A1 vs A1) → you get 4, they get 4
- Play A2 (delegate): then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0, they play A0 → you get 10, they get 10

So if you **always delegate**, and Player 1 is rational, they will choose the action that maximizes their own payoff:

- If Player 1 plays A0 → they get 0
- If they play A1 → they get 4
- If they play A2 → they get 10

So **best choice**: A2 (delegate), giving them 10.

So if you delegate unconditionally, Player 1 will **also delegate**, leading to both playing A0 via mediator → you get 10.

So your payoff: 10.

Alternatively, if you play A0 or A1, what happens?

Let’s suppose you don't delegate. Then you and Player 1 choose A0 or A1 (or maybe they delegate).

But let’s suppose **you consider a mixed strategy with delegation**.

---

### **Step 7: Explore Possible Equilibria**

Let’s suppose **both players use the same strategy** (symmetric equilibrium), and consider their incentives.

Let’s suppose both players randomize over A0, A1, A2.

But because the payoffs are asymmetric, symmetric equilibrium might not exist, or might be hard to find.

Alternatively, let’s **consider whether delegation can be used to exploit the other player**.

Let’s try to **find a strategy for you that makes Player 1 indifferent** between delegating and not.

But perhaps we can do better — let’s suppose **you always delegate** (A2 = 100).

Then, as above, Player 1 will get:

- A0: get 0
- A1: get 4
- A2: get 10 → best

So they will delegate → both delegate → you both play A0 → you get 10.

So your payoff is 10.

Now, what if you **only delegate with some probability**?

Suppose you **mix between A0 and A2**, and never play A1.

Let’s try a simpler case.

---

### **Step 8: Try a Strategy — Always Delegation**

We already did: if you always delegate → Player 1 best responds by delegating → both delegate → A0, A0 → you get 10.

So payoff: 10.

But suppose you try **always playing A1**.

Then you play A1.

Player 1’s options:
- A0: you get 20, they get 0 → Player 1 will hate this
- A1: you get 4, they get 4
- A2: if they delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so Player 1 plays A1 → then (you play A1, they play A1) → you get 4, they get 4

So Player 1’s payoffs:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4
- A2: 4

So they are indifferent between A1 and A2.

So they might choose A2 → you get 4.

But if they choose A1, you get 4 anyway.

So if you play A1 always, Player 1 will not play A0 (since they get 0), so will play A1 or A2 → you get 4.

So payoff = 4.

Worse than 10.

So **delegation is better** than always playing A1.

What if you play A0 always?

Then you play A0.

Player 1:
- A0: 10
- A1: 6 → better than 10? No, 6 < 10
- A2: if they delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so they play A1 → so you play A0, they play A1 → you get 2, they get 6

So player 1’s payoffs:
- A0: 10
- A1: 6
- A2: 6

So they prefer A0 → play A0 → you get 10.

So if you play A0, Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10.

So same as delegation — 10.

So far, both pure strategies A0 and A2 (delegate) give you 10, when facing rational Player 1.

But can we do better?

---

### **Step 9: Explore Mixed Strategy — Delegation + A0**

Let’s suppose you play:
- A0 with probability x
- A2 (delegate) with probability 1−x

Then, depending on what Player 1 does, your expected payoff changes.

But Player 1 will respond optimally.

Let’s suppose Player 1 considers their choices.

For Player 1, depending on how you act, their best response varies.

Let’s suppose you mix between A0 and A2 with probabilities x and (1−x).

Now, if Player 1 chooses:

- **A0**: you are playing A0 with prob x, A2 with prob (1−x)
    - If you play A0: you get 10 or 2 depending on their action
    - If you play A2: then:
        - If only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1 → so if Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20
    - So overall, if Player 1 plays A0:
        - With prob x: you play A0 → you get 10
        - With prob (1−x): you play A2 → you play A1 → you get 20
        - So your expected payoff: 10x + 20(1−x) = 20 − 10x
        - But **Player 1’s payoff**:
            - If you play A0 → you play A0 → Player 1 gets 10
            - If you play A2 → you play A1 → Player 1 plays A0 → so (A1, A0) → Player 1 gets 0
            - So Player 1’s payoff: 10x + 0(1−x) = 10x

- **A1**: Player 1 plays A1
    - If you play A0: (A0, A1) → you get 2, they get 6
    - If you play A2: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4, they get 4
    - So Player 1’s payoff:
        - With prob x: (A0, A1) → get 6
        - With prob (1−x): (A1, A1) → get 4
        - Expected: 6x + 4(1−x) = 4 + 2x

- **A2**: Player 1 delegates
    - Then:
        - If you play A0: then only one delegate (player 1) → mediator plays A1 → so Player 1 plays A1, you play A0 → (A0, A1) → you get 2, they get 6
        - If you play A2: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0, they play A0 → you get 10, they get 10
    - So Player 1’s payoff:
        - With prob x: you play A0 → (A0, A1) → player 1 gets 6
        - With prob (1−x): you play A2 → both delegate → (A0, A0) → player 1 gets 10
        - Expected: 6x + 10(1−x) = 10 − 4x

Now, Player 1 will choose the action with highest payoff:

- A0: 10x
- A1: 4 + 2x
- A2: 10 − 4x

We want to find x such that **Player 1 is indifferent between some actions**, so we can find a **Best Response**.

Suppose we want Player 1 to be indifferent between A1 and A2. Then:

4 + 2x = 10 − 4x  
6x = 6 → x = 1

At x = 1, they are indifferent between A1 and A2? Let's check:

- A0: 10x = 10
- A1: 4 + 2(1) = 6
- A2: 10 − 4(1) = 6

So A0 gives 10, others give 6 → Player 1 will choose A0.

So not indifferent.

Suppose we want Player 1 indifferent between A0 and A1:

10x = 4 + 2x → 8x = 4 → x = 0.5

Then check A2: 10 − 4(0.5) = 8

So A0: 10*0.5 = 5  
A1: 4 + 2*0.5 = 5  
A2: 8 → better

So Player 1 prefers A2 → not indifferent.

Now, let’s make Player 1 indifferent between A1 and A2:

4 + 2x = 10 − 4x → 6x = 6 → x = 1

Then:
- A0: 10(1) = 10
- A1: 4 + 2 = 6
- A2: 10 − 4 = 6

So player 1 prefers A0.

So no point where they are indifferent between A1 and A2 **and** A0 not better.

Now, suppose we want Player 1 indifferent between A0 and A2:

10x = 10 − 4x → 14x = 10 → x = 10/14 ≈ 0.714

Then:
- A0: 10 * (10/14) = 100/14 ≈ 7.14
- A2: 10 − 4*(10/14) = 10 − 40/14 = (140 − 40)/14 = 100/14 ≈ 7.14
- A1: 4 + 2*(10/14) = 4 + 20/14 = 4 + 10/7 ≈ 4 + 1.43 = 5.43

So Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A2, and prefers both to A1.

So Player 1 will play A0 or A2 (any mixture).

Then, what is **your expected payoff**, given you play A0 with x = 10/14, A2 with 4/14.

And Player 1 responds with A0 or A2.

But **we need expected payoff based on what Player 1 does**.

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A2 with probability 1−p, and avoids A1.

Now, compute your expected payoff:

- With probability x = 10/14: you play A0 → you get 10 if Player 1 plays A0, 2 if Player 1 plays A1, 2 if Player 1 plays A2?
    - Wait: if you play A0, and Player 1 plays A2 (delegate), then only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → so you play A0, they play A1 → you get 2
    - If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10
- With probability 1−x = 4/14: you delegate → you get:
    - If Player 1 plays A0: only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 20 (since Player 1 plays A0)
    - If Player 1 plays A2: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → you get 10

So let’s compute expected payoff:

$$
\text{Your expected payoff} = x \cdot \left[ p \cdot 10 + (1−p) \cdot 2 \right] + (1−x) \cdot \left[ p \cdot 20 + (1−p) \cdot 10 \right]
$$

With x = 10/14, 1−x = 4/14

So:

= (10/14)[10p + 2(1−p)] + (4/14)[20p + 10(1−p)]  
= (10/14)[10p + 2 − 2p] + (4/14)[20p + 10 − 10p]  
= (10/14)(8p + 2) + (4/14)(10p + 10)

Now compute:

= (10/14)(8p + 2) = (80p + 20)/14  
= (4/14)(10p + 10) = (40p + 40)/14

Sum: (80p + 20 + 40p + 40)/14 = (120p + 60)/14

This is linear in p.

Since p ∈ [0,1], to maximize your payoff, you want p as large as possible.

But Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A2 for any p (in their best response). But their payoff is **maximized** when they play A0 more (since if they play A0, they get 10 (when you play A0), but if they play A2, they get 10 only when you also delegate).

Wait, no — in the equilibrium, Player 1 is indifferent, so they can choose any p.

But to **maximize your payoff**, you want p to be as large as possible (since your payoff increases with p).

So **you would prefer Player 1 to play A0**.

But **Player 1** would prefer to play A2 when you are delegating, because:
- If you play A0 and they play A2: (A0, A1) → they get 6
- If you play A0 and they play A0: (A0, A0) → they get 10 → better

So in fact, **they prefer A0 if you play A0**.

But if you play A2, they get:
- A0: (A1, A0) → you get 20, they get 0
- A2: (A0, A0) → both get 10 → better

So they prefer A2 when you delegate.

So when you play A2, they prefer A2.

When you play A0, they prefer A0.

But in the indifference point x = 10/14, they are indifferent between A0 and A2 only when you are playing A0 with 10/14, but their preference depends on your action.

Actually, in the equilibrium, they play A0 if that is better, or A2 if better.

But at x = 10/14, we had:
- A0: 10x = 10*(10/14) = 100/14 ≈ 7.14
- A2: 10 − 4x = 10 − 40/14 = 100/14 ≈ 7.14

So they are indifferent.

So they are willing to play any mixture.

But to maximize **your payoff**, you want them to play A0 with high probability.

But **they will not cooperate** with you. They are maximizing their own payoff.

And since A0 and A2 give them the same payoff (7.14), they are indifferent.

So they can choose any mix.

So the **worst-case** for you is if they play A2 with high probability.

But since they are indifferent, we can assume they play the mix that is **least favorable to you** — but that’s not how Nash works.

In **Nash equilibrium**, we assume each player best responds.

But if the player is indifferent, they can play any best response.

To find a **credible equilibrium**, we can assume they play a mixture that makes you indifferent, or we can assume they play in a way that doesn't hurt their payoff.

But to **maximize your minimum** payoff, we should assume they choose the worst for you.

But the instruction is: **maximize your total points**.

So we want the best possible expected payoff, under rational play.

Let’s assume Player 1 will play a strategy that **minimizes your expected payoff** among their best responses, if there is a choice.

But that’s not standard.

Standard Nash equilibrium: players best respond, and if indifferent, can play any mixture.

So the payoff can vary.

But in this case, we want to pick our strategy to **maximize our expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 best responds.

But since at x=10/14, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A2, they might play A0.

Let’s assume they do.

Then p = 1.

Then your expected payoff:

From earlier: (120p + 60)/14 = (120*1 + 60)/14 = 180/14 ≈ 12.857

Is that right?

Let’s recompute with x = 10/14, you play A0 with 10/14, A2 with 4/14.

Player 1 plays A0 with p = 1.

Then your payoff:

- If you play A0 (10/14): Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10
- If you play A2 (4/14): only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20

So expected payoff = (10/14)*10 + (4/14)*20 = (100 + 80)/14 = 180/14 = 90/7 ≈ 12.857

Better than 10!

And Player 1’s payoff:
- When you play A0: A0 vs A0 → they get 10
- When you play A2: A1 vs A0 → they get 0
- Expected: (10/14)*10 + (4/14)*0 = 100/14 ≈ 7.14

Which matches the value we had for A0.

So they are indifferent between A0 and A2 (A2 also gives 7.14), so playing A0 is a best response.

So this is a **valid equilibrium strategy for you**: play A0 with 10/14, A2 with 4/14, and never play A1.

Then Player 1 playing A0 is a best response, and you get ~12.857.

Can you do better?

Suppose you try to increase the weight on delegation.

Let’s suppose you play A0 with x, A2 with 1−x.

We want Player 1 to be indifferent between A0 and A2.

From earlier: A0 payoff for Player 1: 10x

A2 payoff for Player 1: 10 − 4x

Set equal: 10x = 10 − 4x → 14x = 10 → x = 10/14

So this is the **only** value where Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A2.

At this point, if they play A0, you get 180/14 ≈ 12.857

If they play A2, what happens?

Then p = 0.

Your expected payoff:

= (10/14)[ p*10 + (1−p)*2 ] + (4/14)[ p*20 + (1−p)*10 ]

With p = 0:

= (10/14)(2) + (4/14)(10) = 20/14 + 40/14 = 60/14 ≈ 4.286

Worse.

But since they are indifferent, they might play A0.

So best case for you: they play A0 → you get ~12.857

Is there a way to force them to play A0?

Suppose you play only delegation (A2: 100%).

Then Player 1’s best response: A2 → both delegate → you get 10 < 12.857

Worse.

Suppose you play only A0.

Then Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10.

Still worse.

What if you mix A0 and A2, but at x < 10/14?

Then Player 1’s payoff from A0: 10x
From A2: 10 − 4x

If x < 10/14, then 10x < 10 − 4x → so A2 gives higher payoff → Player 1 will play A2.

Then if they play A2, and you play A0 with x, A2 with 1−x:

- You play A0: then you play A0, they play A1 → you get 2
- You play A2: both delegate → you play A0 → you get 10
- Expected: x*2 + (1−x)*10 = 2x + 10 − 10x = 10 − 8x

For x < 10/14 ≈ 0.714, this is > 10 − 8*(0.714) = 10 − 5.714 = 4.286

But the maximum is at x=0: 10

But if Player 1 plays A2, you get 10 only if x=0

But at x=0, Player 1’s payoff from A0: 0, from A2: 10 − 0 = 10, so they play A2 → you get 10.

Not better than 12.857.

Similarly, if you try x > 10/14, then Player 1 prefers A0 (since A0 gives higher payoff), so they play A0.

Then your payoff:

x*10 + (1−x)*20 = 10x + 20 - 20x = 20 - 10x

At x = 10/14 ≈ 0.714, this is 20 - 7.14 = 12.857

As x increases, this decreases.

So maximum at x=10/14.

Therefore, the **optimal strategy** for you is:

- Play A0 with probability 10/14 ≈ 71.43%
- Play A2 (Delegate) with probability 4/14 ≈ 28.57%
- Play A1 with probability 0%

This makes Player 1 indifferent between A0 and A2 (if they are rational), and they will play A0 (since it gives them the same payoff, and you get 12.857 > 4.286 if they play A2).

And since they are indifferent, they can play A0, which is best for you in this context.

Moreover, this is the only value that can give you more than 10.

So we should adopt this strategy.

Now, convert to integers:

10/14 = 5/7 ≈ 71.4286 → rounds to **71**
4/14 = 2/7 ≈ 28.5714 → **29**

But 71 + 29 = 100 — perfect.

So:

- A0: 71
- A1: 0
- A2: 29

Is this valid?

Yes.

And since you get 12.857 if Player 1 plays A0 (which is a best response), and if they play A2, you get only 4.286, but they are indifferent — so they will likely play A0 if it doesn’t hurt them.

But to be conservative, is there a strategy where you get at least 12.857 for sure?

No, because Player 1 might play A2.

But in Nash equilibrium, we assume best response. Since A0 and A2 are both best responses at this x, and A0 is available, it's plausible.

Alternatively, we can check if there’s a best response that gives you more.

But we see that at x=10/14, you can achieve 12.857 in equilibrium.

Any other approach gives less.

Now, could you include A1?

Suppose you play A1 with positive probability.

But from earlier:
- If you play A1, and Player 1 plays A0, you get 20
- But Player 1 gets 0, so they hate it
- So they will never play A0 if you play A1
- They would play A1 or A2

But A1 gives you only 4, A2 gives you 4 (if they play A2 and you play A1) — wait, no:

If you play A1, and player 1 plays A2: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1, they play A1 → you get 4.

If player 1 plays A1: you get 4.

So no benefit.

Whereas if you play A0 or A2, you can get 10 or 20.

So playing A1 gives you at most 4, which is worse than 12.857.

So it’s not worth it.

Therefore, you should **not play A1**.

### ✅ Final Strategy:

- A0: 71
- A1: 0
- A2: 29

Sum: 100

Expected payoff: ~12.857 (if Player 1 plays A0)

And this is the **maximum** you can guarantee in a Nash equilibrium with rational opponent.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix (from my perspective as Player 2)

```
              Player 1
              A0    A1
Player 2  A0  10    2
          A1  20    4
```

## Step 2: Identify Basic Dominance

If I play independently:
- When Player 1 plays A0: A1 gives me 20 vs A0 gives me 10 → A1 is better
- When Player 1 plays A1: A1 gives me 4 vs A0 gives me 2 → A1 is better

**A1 strictly dominates A0** for me, so I should never play A0 independently.

## Step 3: Analyze the Delegation Option

The mediator plays:
- A1 if only 1 player delegates  
- A0 if both players delegate

If I delegate:
- Player 1 also delegates → Both play A0 → I get **10**
- Player 1 plays A0 → I play A1 → I get **20** 
- Player 1 plays A1 → I play A1 → I get **4**

If I play A1 independently:
- Player 1 delegates → Player 1 plays A1, I play A1 → I get **4**
- Player 1 plays A0 → I get **20**
- Player 1 plays A1 → I get **4**

## Step 4: Compare Delegation vs Playing A1

Comparing the two strategies:
- Delegation gives me the **same payoff** as playing A1 when Player 1 doesn't delegate
- Delegation gives me **10 instead of 4** when Player 1 also delegates

Therefore, **delegation weakly dominates playing A1 independently** - it's never worse and sometimes better.

## Step 5: Equilibrium Analysis

The outcome (both delegate) → (10, 10) is a Nash equilibrium:
- If Player 1 delegates, my best response is to delegate (10 vs 4)
- If I delegate, Player 1's best response is to delegate (10 vs 4)

Given that Player 1 proposed this mediator (suggesting they want coordination), and delegation is my weakly dominant strategy, I should delegate with certainty.

response:
To approach this problem, let's proceed step-by-step by examining the mediators proposed and analyzing the potential impact on our points:

### Basic Analysis of Payoffs:
Here’s a quick recap of the payoffs when choosing independently:
- If both choose A0: Both get 10 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 0 points, they get 20 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 6 points, they get 2 points.
- If both choose A1: Both get 4 points.

### Mediator Analysis:
There are two mediators proposed:
1. **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
   - If 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1.
   - If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0.

2. **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
   - If 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1.
   - If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0.

Interestingly, both mediators have the exact same strategy for delegations.

### Outcome of Mediators:
1. If both players delegate:
   - Both mediators will play A0.
   - Result: Both get 10 points.

2. If only one player delegates:
   - The player who delegates will have the mediator play A1.
   - The other player will choose independently.
      - If the independent player chooses A0, the delegate gets 6 points, and the independent player gets 2 points.
      - If the independent player chooses A1, both get 4 points.

3. If neither player delegates:
   - Both play independently.

### Independent Play vs. Mediator:
Playing independently could result in higher variance (0, 4, 6, or 10 points), while delegating to the mediator and coordinating (both delegate) simplifies into a stable outcome (10 points each).

### Decision:
Since both mediators have the same rules, and they offer a stable outcome of 10 points each (if both delegate), it is in your best interest to approve both so that a mediator is selected and delegation becomes a viable option.

Given the symmetry and identical strategies, we should approve both mediators.

### Final JSON Decision:
```json
{
    "M1": true,
    "M2": true
}
```

This way, regardless of which mediator wins the approval process, the strategy and outcome remain favorable for stable, coordinated play, maximizing your points effectively.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

### Game Analysis
Firstly, let's analyze the payoffs in the game from Player 2's perspective:

- If **Player 2 chooses A0** and **Player 1 chooses A0**: 
  - Player 2 gets 10 points.
  - Player 1 gets 10 points.
  
- If **Player 2 chooses A1** and **Player 1 chooses A0**:
  - Player 2 gets 20 points.
  - Player 1 gets 0 points.

- If **Player 2 chooses A0** and **Player 1 chooses A1**:
  - Player 2 gets 2 points.
  - Player 1 gets 6 points.

- If **Player 2 chooses A1** and **Player 1 chooses A1**:
  - Player 2 gets 4 points.
  - Player 1 gets 4 points.

### Strategic Analysis
Understanding the payoff, if both players cooperate and choose A0, they each get the highest joint payoff of (10, 10) points. However, there is a temptation to deviate to A1 for a higher individual payoff, especially if believing the other player will choose A0. 

### Mediator Analysis
Both mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 are identical:
- If 1 player delegates, the mediator will play action A1.
- If 2 players delegate, the mediator will play action A0.

#### Single Delegation:
1. If one player delegates, the mediator will play A1.
   - This scenario can be beneficial if the other player chooses A0 as a reaction (20 points for the delegating player, 0 points for the other).
   - If the other player also plays A1 independently, they each get 4 points, which is better than mutual A0 from a non-cooperative perspective.

#### Both Players Delegating:
2. If both delegate, the mediator will play A0.
   - This results in (10, 10) points, which is the highest joint payoff and encourages mutual cooperation, making it a stable equilibrium.

### Decision to Approve Mediators
Given that both mediators result in the same outcomes for identical conditions and they each help to stabilize cooperation by ensuring mutual A0 when both players delegate, it makes sense to approve both mediators.

### Conclusion
Approving both mediators aligns with my interest to maximize or stabilize my points effectively:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

This approval ensures cooperation is enforced if both players delegate, leading to the optimal outcome of (10, 10). Even if one player doesn't delegate, the strategy accounts for competitive or trusting play.

To determine which mediators to approve, let's carefully review the payoffs and the mediator proposals.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Payoff Matrix:**
   The payoffs can be summarized in a table:
   
   | You \ Other Player  | A0    | A1   |
   |---------------------|-------|------|
   | **A0**              | 10,10 | 0,20 |
   | **A1**              | 6,2   | 4,4  |

2. **Examining Mediators:**
   The mediator proposals are identical:
   - **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator chooses A1.
   - **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator chooses A0.

3. **Payoffs with Mediators:**
   - **Single Delegation Scenario:**
     - If you delegate (and the other doesn't delegate): Mediator plays A1 for you.
     - Resulting payoffs:
       - If the other player plays A0: **You get 6 points**, the other player gets 2 points.
       - If the other player plays A1: **You get 4 points**, the other player gets 4 points.
     
   - **Both Players Delegate:**
     - The mediator for both players results in both playing A0.
     - Resulting payoffs: **Both get 10 points each.**

4. **Decision Based on Mediators:**
   - If no mediator is chosen and both players act independently, both players will aim for reactions that might maximize their individual payoffs based on their beliefs, which could lead to suboptimal global outcomes.
   
   - If both players consent to a mediator, they will collectively play A0 if both delegate (resulting in a mutual 10 points). Alternatively, if one delegates and the other doesn't, the delegating player will play A1, in which case the worst outcome is either 4 (if both choose A1 independently) or outcome 6 (if the non-delegating player plays A0 while the mediator plays A1).

Given the mediators are functionally equivalent, agreeing to either mediator is favorable to opting out, given the strategic safeguards they enable (ensuring both play A0 if both delegate, leading to mutual high points).

### JSON Object for Approvals:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

### Conclusion:

- I approve both mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 because they encourage outcomes that are beneficial, specifically ensuring mutual cooperation yielding high points.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

To determine the best course of action in this decision-making game, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Payoff Table Analysis:**
   - The payoffs for each combination of actions between two players are given as follows:
     ```
     |          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
     |----------|--------|--------|
     | P1: A0   | 10, 10 | 0, 20  |
     | P1: A1   | 6, 2   | 4, 4   |
     ```

2. **Understanding the Mediator Proposals:**
   - Both mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 have identical strategies:
     - If 1 player delegates: Plays A1.
     - If 2 players delegate: Plays A0.

3. **Implications of Mediator Actions:**
   - If only one player delegates to the mediator, that player will play A1, and the other player's independent action will determine the payoff.
   - If both players delegate to the mediator, both will play A0.

4. **Reviewing Payoffs with Mediator:**
   - If Player 1 delegates alone:
     - P1: A1, P2: A0 → P1: 6 points
     - P1: A1, P2: A1 → P1: 4 points
   - If both players delegate:
     - P1: A0, P2: A0 → Both get 10 points

### Reasoning Behind Approval:

- **Delegate Alone:**
  - If only one of the players delegates, choosing A1 results in lower payoffs (6 or 4 points) compared to coordinating on A0 (potentially 10 points for both).
  
- **Both Delegate:**
  - If both delegate, we ensure both players play A0 and receive the highest joint payoff (10 points each).

Thus, having mediators that operate identically and promote mutual delegation incentivizes higher payoffs through mutual cooperation (10 points each).

### Decision:

Since the mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 are the same in terms of strategy, it is rational to approve both of them to maximize the chance of having a mediator that ensures mutual cooperation, leading to the highest joint payoff.

### Final JSON Object:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

This result ensures a higher likelihood that we can coordinate on the high-payoff outcome by making the mediators as strategy-aligned as possible.

response:
To solve this question, we need to break it down step-by-step as follows:

### Step 1: Understanding the Base Game Without a Mediator

In the basic game without a mediator, the payoffs are as follows:

- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

From Player 1's perspective, the optimal action depends on what Player 2 is expected to do. The payoffs suggest that if both players cooperate and both choose A0, they get the highest combined payoff (20 points). If both choose A1, they get a smaller combined payoff (8 points).

### Step 2: Understanding the Mediators

Both mediators (M1 and M2) proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 follow the same rule:
- If 1 player delegates: Play A1
- If 2 players delegate: Play A0

This means the mediators enforce a coordination mechanism. If only one player decides to delegate, the mediator chooses A1, aligning with the less cooperative option yielding lower payoffs (incentivizing non-delegation if only one player is thinking of delegating). If both players delegate, the mediator chooses A0, enforcing the cooperative and higher payoff mechanism.

### Step 3: Evaluating Delegation and Payoffs

- **When no mediator is involved**:
  - The players face a typical coordination problem.
  
- **When exactly one player delegates**:
  - The remaining player must choose an action independently. Since the mediators play A1 in this case, the non-delegating player might want to align with A1 to avoid a suboptimal outcome.

- **When both players delegate**:
  - The mediator plays A0, leading to the best mutual payoff for both players.

### Step 4: Deciding on Approvals

Given that both proposed mediators enforce the same rule:
- They both seem fair and effective in ensuring coordination for the highest payoffs when both players delegate.
- Approving either of them results in the same behavior, which incentivizes Player 1 to delegate, as it mitigates the risk of facing non-cooperative outcomes.

Since the mediators are identical in behavior and beneficial for ensuring higher average payoffs when both delegate, it makes sense to approve both mediators.

### Final Decision:

Thus, the appropriate JSON object reflecting the approvals would be:
```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}
```

This decision signifies that both mediators are approved, allowing the selection process to proceed, knowing either choice results in a coordination mechanism suitable for maximizing payoffs.

To tackle this problem, we need to evaluate the mediators proposed by both players within the context of the game's payoff matrix and the delegation rules.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Mediators' Actions**:
   - Both mediators (proposed by Player 1 and Player 2) will play the same actions under the same conditions:
     - If only one player delegates, the action will be A1.
     - If both players delegate, the action will be A0.

2. **Evaluation of Payoffs for Different Scenarios**:
   - **No Delegation**:
     - We both independently choose A0 or A1 based on our mixed strategies.
   
   - **One Player Delegates**:
     - If I delegate and Player 2 does not:
       - Mediator plays A1 and Player 2 picks independently:
         - If Player 2 chooses A0: I get 6 points.
         - If Player 2 chooses A1: I get 4 points.
       - Expected payoff depends on Player 2's probabilities.

     - If Player 2 delegates and I do not:
       - Mediator plays A1 and I choose independently:
         - If I choose A0: I get 0 points.
         - If I choose A1: I get 4 points.
       - Expected payoff depends on my probabilities.

   - **Both Players Delegate**:
     - Mediator plays A0 for both:
       - I get 10 points.
       - Player 2 also gets 10 points.

3. **Optimal Strategy Considerations**:
   - The mediators are identical in their behavior, thus both are equally beneficial or detrimental.
   - **Rational Players' Actions**:
     - Ideally, if both players delegate, the outcome (A0, A0) yields the highest combined payoff (20 points split evenly).
     - If no delegations occur, the Nash equilibrium of the game without mediators should be considered.

4. **Approval Voting**:
   - Given both mediators behave identically and provide symmetric payoffs for similar actions, the rational move is to approve both mediators.
   - Supporting the approval of both mediators increases the likelihood of reaching the beneficial delegation outcome (A0, A0) if Player 2 also votes similarly.

### Final Decision:
Both proposed mediators should be approved because they provide an opportunity for mutual benefit when both players delegate.

### JSON Output:
Here is the JSON object expressing my approval:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

By approving both mediators, it leaves the choice equally likely and allows for facilitating a higher mutual payoff if both decide to use mediation.

To determine which mediators to approve, we need to analyze their behavior in relation to our objective of maximizing our points. Let's break down how each mediator operates under different delegation scenarios.

### Mediator Analysis

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **If 1 player delegates to the mediator:** It will play action A1.
- **If 2 players delegate to the mediator:** It will play action A0.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- **If 1 player delegates to the mediator:** It will play action A0.
- **If 2 players delegate to the mediator:** It will play action A1.

Given the payoff description:
- **(A0, A0)** gives 10 points to each player.
- **(A0, A1)** gives 0 points to Player 1 and 20 points to Player 2.
- **(A1, A0)** gives 6 points to Player 1 and 2 points to Player 2.
- **(A1, A1)** gives 4 points to each player.

### Evaluating Payoffs with Mediators
Let's evaluate the scenarios based on whether one or both players delegate to the mediator and the resulting actions:

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **1 player delegates:** Mediator plays A1.
  - If I delegate and the other player does not, I'm locked to A1. The other player's independent choice will define the outcome:
    - **Other chooses A0:** I get 6 points.
    - **Other chooses A1:** I get 4 points.
  - A1 vs. (A0 or A1) results in 6 or 4 points for me.
- **2 players delegate:** Mediator plays A0.
  - Both players get 10 points from (A0, A0).

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- **1 player delegates:** Mediator plays A0.
  - If I delegate and the other player does not, I'm locked to A0. The other player's independent choice will define the outcome:
    - **Other chooses A0:** I get 10 points.
    - **Other chooses A1:** I get 0 points.
  - A0 vs. (A0 or A1) results in 10 or 0 points for me.
- **2 players delegate:** Mediator plays A1.
  - Both players get 4 points from (A1, A1).

### Strategy to Maximize Points
To maximize my points, I must consider the scenarios:
- Mediator proposed by Player 1:
  - **High certainty**: If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0 (10 points each).
  - **Moderate payoff**: If only I delegate, mediator plays A1 (6 or 4 points for me depending on the other player's independent action).
- Mediator proposed by Player 2:
  - **Higher risk**: If only I delegate, other’s independence (A1) results in 0 points for me.
  - **Lower payoff**: If both delegate, only 4 points each.

The mediator by Player 1 provides a more secure high payoff scenario (A0 when both delegate) and a moderate alternative (A1 when only I delegate). The mediator by Player 2 involves higher risk when only I delegate and generally results in lower payoffs given its strategies.

### Final Approval Decision
- **Approve Mediator proposed by Player 1**: It provides the best balance of payoffs, especially with higher certainty.
- **Reject Mediator proposed by Player 2**: It has a higher risk of low payoff (0 points) and generally lower secure payoffs.

### JSON Output
```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": false
}
```

This ensures that the best mediator for maximizing our points under consideration is approved.

Both proposed mediators are identical:  
- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1**  
- If both players delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So which mediator gets selected doesn’t change the game outcomes at all. Approving both weakly dominates approving only one, because it can’t make the selected mediator “worse” (they’re the same), and it can only increase the chance that an acceptable mediator is selected under approval voting.

response:
To decide on the best strategy for this game, let's analyze each aspect step-by-step, considering both direct play and the option to delegate to the mediator.

### Understanding the Payoff Matrix:

1. **Direct Play without Mediator:**
   - If both players choose A0: Each gets 10 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 20 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 6 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
   - If both players choose A1: Each gets 4 points.

2. **Delegation to Mediator:**
   - If only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1 on their behalf.
   - If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0 on their behalf.

### Strategy Analysis:

To maximize our points, we need to consider how delegating or choosing each action can affect our outcome, especially since the mediator's action changes based on the number of delegators.

### Possible Scenarios:

1. **Player 1 Delegates and Player 2 doesn't delegate:**
   - Mediator plays A1 for Player 1, and Player 2 will choose A0 or A1 directly.
     - If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 6 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
     - If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 4 points, Player 2 gets 4 points.

2. **Both Players Delegate:**
   - Mediator plays A0 for both, and each gets 10 points.

3. **Player 1 doesn't delegate and Player 2 delegates:**
   - Mediator plays A1 for Player 2.
     - If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 20 points.
     - If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 4 points, Player 2 gets 4 points.

4. **Neither Player Delegates:**
   - Each player chooses between A0 and A1 directly.

### Optimal Probability Distribution:

To maximize our points, it's beneficial to use the mediator strategically:

- **Higher probability of delegating to the mediator (A2):** This ensures cooperation if the opponent is likely to delegate.
- **Mixed strategies between A0 and A1:** To outmaneuver when the opponent might not delegate.

### Final Probability Distribution:

Considering these factors, the probabilities for each action can be as follows:

- **Delegate to Mediator (A2):** Higher probability to encourage cooperation.
- **Direct Action A0 and A1:** Balanced probability distribution to adjust for non-delegation scenarios.

Here's the resulting JSON object:

```json
{"A0": 20, "A1": 20, "A2": 60}
```

### Explanation:

- **A2 (Delegate to Mediator):** 60% probability encourages mutual cooperation for maximum points.
- **A0 and A1:** Each with 20% to keep a balance in case Player 2 does not delegate.

This distribution maximizes Player 1's potential points by leveraging the mediator while maintaining flexibility for direct play.

response:
To solve this decision-making game, we need to break down the problem step by step and consider the potential outcomes and strategies.

### Game Breakdown

#### Payoff Matrix:
```
                | Player 1: A0     | Player 1: A1     |
------------------------------------------------------
Player 2: A0    | P2: 10, P1: 10   | P2: 2, P1: 6    |
Player 2: A1    | P2: 20, P1: 0    | P2: 4, P1: 4    |
```

#### Actions:
- A0: Act independently and choose action A0.
- A1: Act independently and choose action A1.
- A2: Act by delegating to the mediator.

### Mediator Rules:
- If both Player 1 and Player 2 delegate to the mediator, the mediator will play action A0 for both.
- If only one player delegates to the mediator, the mediator will play action A1 for the delegating player.

### Consideration:
1. **If we delegate (A2):**
   - If both players delegate, the mediator will play A0 for both, resulting in a payoff of (10, 10).
   - If only Player 2 delegates, the mediator will play A1 for Player 2. The expected action of Player 1 needs to be considered.

2. **If we act independently (A0 or A1):**
   - Choosing A0 gives a safe but lower average return if Player 1 cooperates.
   - Choosing A1 yields a higher reward but substantial risk if Player 1 also acts independently.

### Optimal Strategy Exploration:
We need to consider a mixed strategy because the pure strategies yield variable outcomes depending on the actions of Player 1. 

#### Mixed Strategy Calculation:
1. **Player 1 Choices:**
   - It's reasonable to assume Player 1 will mix between cooperating (A0) and defecting (A1).
   - Rational Player 1 might anticipate Player 2 may delegate or act independently based on past outcomes or probability matching.

2. **Player 2 Optimal Mix:**
   - Let's explore probabilities.

For example, we might explore a scenario where Player 2 roughly balances:
- **A0**: by considering mutual cooperation.
- **A1**: leveraging higher points when Player 1 chooses A0.
- **A2**: using the mediator to avoid conflict and defer decision.

### Computational Probability Decision:
```plaintext
- Assign probabilities with balance for risk and cooperation.
- Example distribution for balance in gain with minimized risk:
    - A0: 50%
    - A1: 25%
    - A2: 25%
```

### Final Mix in JSON format:
Combining all potential strategies, let's apply this mix for a balanced approach:

```json
{"A0": 40, "A1": 30, "A2": 30}
```

Here:
- **A0 (40%)**: Encourages potential mutual cooperation with reasonable payoff.
- **A1 (30%)**: Balances the higher reward seeking when Player 1 may cooperate.
- **A2 (30%)**: Defers decision-making to mediator to leverage symmetry and reduce conflict.

### Conclusion:
This balanced mixed strategy should maximize expected value given the various outcomes and player strategies. Here is the JSON object representing the probability distribution:

```json
{"A0": 40, "A1": 30, "A2": 30}
```
This balanced approach should yield consistent returns while managing risk efficiently.

Both proposed mediators implement exactly the same policy:

- If both players delegate: mediator plays **A0**

Since there is no payoff-relevant difference between M1 and M2, I’m indifferent between them. Approving both cannot make the selected mediator worse (because they’re identical), and it weakly increases the chance that an approved mediator is selected in any approval-count tie situations.

response:
Let's analyze the game dynamics and the mediators proposed in order to make an informed decision about approving the mediators.

### Analyze the Original Payoff Matrix
The payoff matrix for this game is as follows:

|            | Player 2: A0  | Player 2: A1  |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Player 1: A0 | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)        |
| Player 1: A1 | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)        |

Where the notation (x, y) represents (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff).

### Insights from the Payoff Matrix:
1. If both players cooperate and choose A0, they both get 10 points each.
2. If Player 1 chooses A1 while Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 20 points but Player 2 gets 0 points.
3. If Player 1 chooses A0 while Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 2 points but Player 2 gets 6 points.
4. If both choose A1, they both get 4 points each.

In terms of self-interest, choosing A1 could be more beneficial if the other player isn't expected to cooperate. However, mutual cooperation yields a higher total score for both players.

### Mediator Analysis
Each proposed mediator has the following strategies:

- Both mediators (Mediator proposed by Player 1 and Mediator proposed by Player 2):
  - If 1 player delegates, it plays A1.
  - If 2 players delegate, it plays A0.

This design essentially creates an incentive for both players to delegate because if they both delegate:
  - The mediator will choose A0, yielding a joint payoff of (10, 10), which is optimal for both players compared to other mixed choices.

### Decision to Approve
Since both proposed mediators have identical strategies, delegating to either can help assure mutual cooperation:
1. If any player delegates independently, the mediator will play A1, which results in (4, 4) if both choose self-interest.
2. If both delegate, the mediator will force A0, resulting in the optimal (10, 10) joint result.

With mutual delegation, A0 is enforced, resulting in 10 points for both players. Given that both mediators ensure the same behavior, they both achieve the optimal outcome when both players delegate.

### Final Decision
Since both mediators offer the highest potential benefit equally, we should approve both.

response:
To solve this problem, let's systematically break down the decision-making process.

### Step 1: Understanding the Actions and Payoffs

First, let's analyze the payoffs for the non-delegated actions:
- If both players select A0: Each gets 10 points.
- If Player 1 selects A0 and Player 2 selects A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 20 points.
- If Player 1 selects A1 and Player 2 selects A0: Player 1 gets 6 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
- If both players select A1: Each gets 4 points.

### Step 2: Understanding the Mediator

If Player 1 delegates to the mediator:
- If only Player 1 delegates: The mediator will play A1.
- If both players delegate: The mediator will play A0 for both.

### Step 3: Analyzing the Strategy

#### Delegating to the Mediator 
- If only you delegate (Player 1), and the other player does not delegate, you will get 4 points because the mediator will play A1.
- If both delegate, you effectively agree to play A0, receiving 10 points each.

#### Non-Delegating Strategy
- If you play A0 without delegating, you will get:
  - 10 points if the other player also plays A0.
  - 0 points if the other player plays A1.
- If you play A1 without delegating, you will get:
  - 6 points if the other player plays A0.
  - 4 points if the other player plays A1.

### Step 4: Optimal Mixed Strategy
Given the nature of the mediator and the payoffs, the following points are crucial:
- Delegating ensures at least some points (minimum 4) and, if both players delegate, maximizes the joint outcome.
- Non-delegating has a higher variance: potentially higher payoff (10 or 6 with A1) but also risks (0 points).

Given these, the rational strategy would be to encourage coordination by delegating while balancing the risk.

### Step 5: Formulating a Mixed Strategy
An optimal strategy should consider all outcomes:
- A0: Good if both cooperate but risky if not.
- A1: Moderate but stable payoff.
- A2 (Delegate): A middle-ground leading to coordination.

Let's allocate the probabilities accordingly:

1. Assign a significant but not overwhelming probability to delegation to leverage the mediator.
2. Allocate remaining probability to A0 and A1 such that the overall risk and reward is balanced.

Given the payoffs and the mediator's influence, a fair split might be:
- A0: 40%
- A1: 20%
- A2 (Delegate to Mediator): 40%

This strategy ensures some delegation to utilize the mediator but not solely relying on it, while balancing direct actions.

### Final Output

```json
{"A0": 40, "A1": 20, "A2": 40}
```

This distribution aims to leverage the mediator while allowing for some direct strategic interplay.

To maximize your points in this game, let's first analyze the payoff matrix (with you as Player 2):

- (P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A0): (10, 10)
- (P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1): (0, 20)
- (P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0): (6, 2)
- (P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A1): (4, 4)

In the standard game, as Player 2, action A1 is your dominant strategy (20 > 10 if P1 chooses A0, and 4 > 2 if P1 chooses A1). Knowing this, a rational Player 1 would expect you to play A1 and would choose their best response, which is A1 (4 > 0). This results in a Nash Equilibrium of (A1, A1), where both players receive 4 points.

Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for that player. As calculated above, the non-delegating player would respond with A1, leading to a (4, 4) result.
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both players. This results in the cooperative (10, 10) outcome.

By approving and subsequently delegating to either of these mediators, you create a new game where the players can reach the Pareto-superior outcome of (10, 10). If only one or zero players delegate, the outcome remains (4, 4). Since the mediators provide a path to a higher payoff without any risk of a worse outcome compared to the standard Nash Equilibrium, it is in your best interest to approve both.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
The objective of this game is to maximize the total points received as Player 2. Let's analyze the game and the mediator designs step by step.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The payoff matrix for (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Dominant Strategy for Player 2:**
- If P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) or 20 (A1). P2 chooses A1.
- If P1 chooses A1: P2 gets 2 (A0) or 4 (A1). P2 chooses A1.
Player 2’s dominant strategy is **A1**.

**Best Response for Player 1:**
- If P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) or 6 (A1). P1 chooses A0.
- If P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 0 (A0) or 4 (A1). P1 chooses A1.
Since P2 will always play A1, P1 will also play **A1**.

**Equilibrium Outcome:** (A1, A1) with a payoff of **(4, 4)**.

### 2. Analysis of the Mediators
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- If 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0 for both players.

**Delegation Game Scenarios:**
- **Both delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both. Outcome: (A0, A0) → **(10, 10)**.
- **Only Player 1 delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for P1. Player 2, playing independently, will choose A1 (their dominant strategy). Outcome: (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**.
- **Only Player 2 delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for P2. Player 1, playing independently, will choose A1 (best response to A1). Outcome: (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**.
- **Neither delegates:** The game proceeds to the original Nash Equilibrium. Outcome: (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**.

### 3. Conclusion
In the delegation stage, both players delegating to the mediator results in an outcome of (10, 10), which is significantly higher than the original equilibrium of (4, 4). While (4, 4) remains the fallback if either player opts out, (Delegate, Delegate) becomes a new, more profitable Nash Equilibrium. 

Since both mediators are identical and offer a path to a higher payoff for both players, approving both is the optimal strategy.

response:
To maximize our points, we need to carefully consider the payoff matrix, the presence of the mediator, and the decisions the other player could make.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Basic Game Payoffs:
Evaluate the payoffs for different actions:
- \( A0, A0 \) results in (10, 10)
- \( A0, A1 \) results in (0, 20)
- \( A1, A0 \) results in (6, 2)
- \( A1, A1 \) results in (4, 4)

#### Mediator Strategy:
Let's analyze what happens if we delegate to the mediator:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator will play \( A1 \).
- If both players delegate, the mediator will play \( A0 \).

Given that the other player's choice affects whether delegating is beneficial, let's consider the scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Both players delegate.
- The mediator plays \( A0 \).
- Payoff (A0, A0) results in (10, 10).

#### Scenario 2: Only one player delegates.
- The mediator plays \( A1 \).
- The non-delegating player:
  * If they play \( A0 \), result is (6, 2).
  * If they play \( A1 \), result is (4, 4).

### Strategic Consideration
We want a mixed strategy that best responds to the other player's likely choices, incorporating the possibility of using the mediator.

#### Let's break it down:
1. **Pure Strategy Outcomes:**
   - Playing \( A0 \) always is risky because if the other player plays \( A1 \), we get 0 points.
   - Playing \( A1 \) always yields suboptimal local outcomes, but pairing with \( A0 \) from the other side has modest benefits.
   - Always delegating might lead to a definite \( A1 \) if solo or a mutual \( A0 \).

2. **Mixed Strategy:**
   - By mixing \( A0 \), \( A1 \), and \( A2 \) (delegation), we hedge against the risk of the worst payoffs while still aiming to get a high score.

Considering the best response approach:
- **Play \( A0 \)** enough to pair often if the other player follows expecting mutual delegation (10 points).
- **Play \( A1 \)** with some probability to ensure fallback on reasonably stable outcomes.
- **Delegate \( A2 \)** when we can expect the mediator to assist.

### Final Strategy
Given the above, let's set probabilities for each action:
- Assign a reasonable chance to delegate for optimal mediator involvement.
- Mix between \( A0 \) and \( A1 \) to balance out direct actions.

**Proposed Distribution**:
- \( A0 \): 40%
- \( A1 \): 30%
- \( A2 \) (Delegation): 30%

This balances aiming for the optimal outcomes possible with mitigating risks.

```json
{"A0": 40, "A1": 30, "A2": 30}
```

This distribution should maximize our total expected points by balancing direct payoffs and leveraging the mediator effectively.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the baseline game without a mediator

Let me analyze the Nash equilibrium:
- **Other player's perspective**: They prefer A1 regardless of what I do
  - If I play A0: They get 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0 → prefer A1
  - If I play A1: They get 4 from A1 vs 2 from A0 → prefer A1
  - **A1 is their dominant strategy**

- **My perspective**: Given other plays A1
  - If I play A0: I get 0
  - If I play A1: I get 4
  - **I should play A1**

**Baseline Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → payoffs (4, 4)**

## Step 2: Analyze what each mediator does

Both M1 and M2 are identical:
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

## Step 3: Analyze outcomes with this mediator present

Let me check all delegation scenarios:

**Case 1: Both delegate**
- Mediator plays A0 for both
- **Payoffs: (10, 10)** ✓ This is excellent!

**Case 2: Only I delegate**
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- Other player (not delegating) plays A1 (their dominant strategy)
- **Payoffs: (4, 4)**

**Case 3: Only other delegates**
- Mediator plays A1 for them
- I face A1, so I optimally play A1
- **Payoffs: (4, 4)**

**Case 4: Neither delegates**
- Back to baseline Nash equilibrium
- **Payoffs: (4, 4)**

## Step 4: Check if delegation is an equilibrium strategy

**Is (Delegate, Delegate) a Nash equilibrium?**
- If other delegates: I get 10 from delegating vs 4 from not delegating → **I prefer to delegate**
- If I delegate: Other gets 10 from delegating vs 4 from not delegating → **Other prefers to delegate**

Yes! Both players delegating is a Nash equilibrium.

## Step 5: Compare with baseline

- **With mediator (both delegate)**: (10, 10)
- **Without mediator**: (4, 4)

The mediator **strictly improves both players' outcomes** with no downside risk (worst case with mediator is still (4, 4)).

## Step 6: Decision

Since M1 and M2 are functionally identical and both enable the beneficial cooperative outcome of (10, 10), I should approve both.

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game without mediator

Let me first understand the payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):

**My payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 0  
- (A1, A0): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

**Player 2's payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A1, A1): 4

This resembles a prisoner's dilemma. While (A0, A0) gives us both 10 points, Player 2 has a strong incentive to play A1 (getting 20 if I play A0, or 4 if I play A1). The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with both getting only 4 points.

## Step 2: Analyze what the mediators do

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 3: Analyze delegation scenarios with these mediators

**If both delegate:** 
- Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get 10, Player 2 gets 10 ✓

**If only I delegate:** 
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- Player 2's best response to A1 is A1 (gets 4 vs 2)
- Result: (A1, A1) → I get 4, Player 2 gets 4

**If only Player 2 delegates:** 
- Mediator plays A1 for Player 2  
- My best response to A1 is A1 (gets 4 vs 0)
- Result: (A1, A1) → I get 4, Player 2 gets 4

**If neither delegates:**
- Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → both get 4

## Step 4: Determine if delegation is rational

With these mediators, the delegation game becomes:
- Both delegate: (10, 10) ← **Best outcome**
- Any other combination: (4, 4)

Delegating **weakly dominates** not delegating for both players! If the other player delegates, I'm better off delegating (10 > 4). If they don't delegate, I'm indifferent (both give 4).

## Step 5: Conclusion

Both mediators solve the coordination problem by providing a commitment device. When both players rationally delegate, we achieve (10, 10) instead of the Nash equilibrium of (4, 4). Since M1 and M2 are identical and both beneficial, I should approve both.

| Me: A0 | 10, 10    | 0, 20     |
| Me: A1 | 6, 2      | 4, 4      |

## Step 2: Find the Nash equilibrium without mediation

- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (10 points) over A1 (6 points)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 points) over A0 (0 points)

For the other player:
- If I play A0: they prefer A1 (20 points) over A0 (10 points)
- If I play A1: they prefer A1 (4 points) over A0 (2 points)

**The other player has A1 as a dominant strategy.** Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoff (4, 4).

## Step 3: Compare the mediators

**Mediator 1:**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**Mediator 2:**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**Both mediators are identical!**

## Step 4: Analyze outcomes with the mediator

If both players delegate:
- Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get **10 points** (vs 4 in Nash equilibrium)

If only one player delegates:
- Mediator plays A1 for that player → likely leads to (A1, A1) → 4 points

## Step 5: Strategic assessment

The mediator creates a coordination mechanism:
- **Both delegate** is an attractive equilibrium: (10, 10) - Pareto superior to (4, 4)
- The "1 player → A1" rule protects against exploitation
- Having this mediator available is strictly better than having no mediator

## Conclusion

Since both mediators are functionally identical and both enable beneficial coordination that improves outcomes from (4, 4) to (10, 10), I should approve both.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

response:
To maximize our total points in this game, we need to carefully consider the potential outcomes and the strategy of both players. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of our decision-making process:

### Basic Understanding
First, let's analyze the payoff matrix to understand the potential outcomes depending on the combination of our actions and Player 1’s actions.

|        | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **You: A0** | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)       |
| **You: A1** | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |
| **You: A2 (Delegate)** | Depends on the mediator’s input |

When considering to delegate to a mediator:
- If only Player 2 (you) delegates, the mediator will choose A1.
- If both Player 1 and Player 2 delegate, the mediator will choose A0.

### Payoff Analysis
- If we both delegate and the mediator chooses A0, we get (10, 10).
- If we delegate and the mediator chooses A1 (only you delegate), we get (4, 4) if Player 1 chooses A1, and (20, 0) if Player 1 chooses A0.

Let’s use these points to calculate expected payoffs under different scenarios:
1. **If we play A0:**
   - Against A0: We get 10 points.
   - Against A1: We get 2 points.
   
2. **If we play A1:**
   - Against A0: We get 20 points.
   - Against A1: We get 4 points.
   
3. **If we delegate (A2):**
   - If Player 1 also delegates, the mediator will play A0, and we get 10 points.
   - If Player 1 does not delegate, the mediator plays A1, we have:
     - Against A0, we get 20 points.
     - Against A1, we get 4 points.

Given these expected outcomes, let's consider dividing our strategy.

### Strategy Breakdown
Playing purely A0, A1, or delegating (A2) each have different risk profiles. The mediator strategy seems reliable if we consider Player 1's likely strategies.

Considering:
- If Player 1 plays A0, we ideally want to play A1.
- If Player 1 plays A1, then both playing A0 or A1 could yield respectively lower points than delegating.
- The highest gains are from us being the sole delegator or both delegating.

### Mixed Strategy
To balance between all the possible outcomes, let’s construct a mixed strategy:

We give:
- Less weight to A0 since it has lower payoffs on average.
- More weight to A2 (delegate) since it maximizes our payoff within certain scenarios.
- Moderate weight to A1 to still leverage the potential high payoff when Player 1 plays A0.

Let's say:
- A0: 15%
- A1: 35%
- A2: 50%

Finally, encode this in JSON:

```json
{"A0": 15, "A1": 35, "A2": 50}
```

This distribution balances between acting independently and the potential advantages of delegation to the mediator.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

Let me first analyze the game without a mediator. From my perspective (Player 1):

**My Payoff Matrix:**
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

**Player 2's Payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): They get 10
- (A0, A1): They get 20
- (A1, A0): They get 2
- (A1, A1): They get 4

## Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium Without Mediator

From Player 2's perspective:
- If I play A0: they get 10 from A0 vs 20 from A1 → prefer A1
- If I play A1: they get 2 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A1

Player 2 strictly dominates with A1 (always better regardless of what I do).

Given Player 2 plays A1:
- I get 0 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → I prefer A1

**Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4)**

## Step 3: Analyze Both Proposed Mediators

Both M1 and M2 are identical:
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

## Step 4: Evaluate Possible Outcomes with Mediator

1. **Both delegate:** Mediator plays (A0, A0) → **(10, 10)** ✓
2. **Only I delegate:** Mediator plays A1 for me, Player 2 responds optimally with A1 → (4, 4)
3. **Only Player 2 delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for them, I respond optimally with A1 → (4, 4)
4. **Neither delegates:** Revert to base game Nash → (4, 4)

## Step 5: Check for Equilibrium with Mediator

The strategy profile (Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium:
- If I deviate to Not Delegate while Player 2 delegates: I get 4 instead of 10 (no incentive)
- If Player 2 deviates to Not Delegate while I delegate: They get 4 instead of 10 (no incentive)

This gives us the **Pareto optimal outcome (10, 10)**, much better than (4, 4)!

## Step 6: Decision

Both mediators:
- Are identical in design
- Enable coordination on the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome
- Have no downside (worst case is still (4, 4), same as without mediator)
- Provide a clear improvement path from 4 to 10 points

**I should approve both mediators.**

To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix between Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (Me, P2).

1.  **Analyze the base game (A0, A1):**
    *   (P1:A0, P2:A0) → (10, 10)
    *   (P1:A0, P2:A1) → (0, 20)
    *   (P1:A1, P2:A0) → (6, 2)
    *   (P1:A1, P2:A1) → (4, 4)
    *   For P2, A1 is a strictly dominant strategy (20 > 10 and 4 > 2).
    *   Knowing P2 will likely play A1, P1's best response is to play A1 (4 > 0).
    *   The Nash Equilibrium for the base game is (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

2.  **Analyze the game with the mediator (A2):**
    *   If one player delegates (A2), the mediator plays A1 for them.
    *   If both players delegate (A2), the mediator plays A0 for both.
    *   The expanded payoff matrix for (P1, P2) including the delegation action (A2) is:
        *   (A0, A2): Mediator plays A1 for P2 → (P1:A0, P2:A1) = (0, 20)
        *   (A1, A2): Mediator plays A1 for P2 → (P1:A1, P2:A1) = (4, 4)
        *   (A2, A0): Mediator plays A1 for P1 → (P1:A1, P2:A0) = (6, 2)
        *   (A2, A1): Mediator plays A1 for P1 → (P1:A1, P2:A1) = (4, 4)
        *   (A2, A2): Mediator plays A0 for both → (P1:A0, P2:A0) = (10, 10)

3.  **Evaluate strategies for Player 2 (Me):**
    *   If P1 plays A0: A0=10, A1=20, A2=20
    *   If P1 plays A1: A0=2, A1=4, A2=4
    *   If P1 plays A2: A0=2, A1=4, A2=10
    Comparing A1 and A2, A2 is always equal to or better than A1. Specifically, if Player 1 also delegates (A2), I receive 10 points instead of 4.

4.  **Evaluate strategies for Player 1:**
    *   If P2 plays A0: A0=10, A1=6, A2=6
    *   If P2 plays A1: A0=0, A1=4, A2=4
    *   If P2 plays A2: A0=0, A1=4, A2=10
    Comparing A1 and A2 for Player 1, A2 is also always as good as or better than A1.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    The action A2 (Delegate) is a weakly dominant strategy for both players. If both players are rational and seek to maximize their points, they will both choose to delegate, resulting in a payoff of 10 points each. This is much better than the base game Nash Equilibrium of 4 points and provides a coordination mechanism that is self-enforcing.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy, let's breakdown the game scenario systematically:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Understand Payoffs and Best Responses:**
    - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 10 points, Player 2 gets 10 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 20 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 6 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 4 points, Player 2 gets 4 points.

2. **Examine the Mediator's Mechanic:**
    - If exactly 1 player delegates, the Mediator will play action A1 for that player.
    - If both players delegate, the Mediator will play action A0 for both players.

3. **Optimal Delegation:**
    - If you (Player 1) delegate and Player 2 doesn't, you'll play A1.
    - If you don't delegate and Player 2 does, Player 2 will play A1, and you get points according to your own choice vs. A1.
    - If both delegate, both play A0, getting 10 points each.

### Analysis of Mixed Strategies:
- **Without Delegation**:
  - Choosing A0 results in 10 points vs. 10 or 0 depending on Player 2.
  - Choosing A1 results in 6 points vs. 2 points in the non-delegation scenario.
  
- **With Delegation**:
  - If only one player delegates (say, Player 1 delegates), and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 plays A1 and gets 4 points.
  - If both players delegate, both play A0 and get 10 points each.

### Finding an Equilibrium:
1. **Delegation Factor**:
   By delegating, there’s a possibility to guarantee higher joint payoffs without risking lower individual scores via trusting non-cooperation scenarios.

2. **Mixed Strategy Consideration**:
   Player 1 could mix between delegating and playing A0 to balance potential outcomes and incentives for mutual cooperation.

### Optimized Probabilities:
Given the goal to maximize expected payoffs, aiming for a mutual delegation while securing against non-delegation options as a safety net makes strategic sense:

- Assign a high probability to delegating to the mediator to ensure mutually beneficial outcomes.
- Mix direct actions to safeguard unilateral deviations on Player 2’s part.

Let’s choose the following:
- Delegate (A2) most frequently.
- Blend A0 as a part of the mixed strategy to cover potential non-cooperation.

Here's the exact probability distribution:
```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 10, "A2": 80}
```

### Explanation:
- **80% Delegation (A2)**: High likelihood to ensure mediator guides both players towards mutually beneficial outcomes.
- **10% A0 (Independent)**: Moderate security against Player 2's A1.
- **10% A1 (Independent)**: Minor balancing towards payoff when expected opposition favors A0 or no cooperation.

Thus, the final JSON object reflecting the above probabilities would be:

```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 10, "A2": 80}
```

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game
The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

### Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium Without Mediator
- **For Player 2**: A1 is a dominant strategy
  - If I play A0: they get 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0
  - If I play A1: they get 4 from A1 vs 2 from A0
- **For me (Player 1)**: Knowing they'll play A1, I should play A1
  - A1 gives me 4 vs A0 gives me 0

**Nash Equilibrium**: (A1, A1) → Both get 4 points

### Step 3: Analyze the Mediators
Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

### Step 4: Analyze Delegation Scenarios

**Case 1: Both delegate**
- Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0)
- I get **10 points** ✓

**Case 2: Only I delegate**  
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- Other player (independently) plays A1 (their dominant strategy)
- Outcome: (A1, A1) → I get **4 points**

**Case 3: Only other delegates**
- Mediator plays A1 for them
- I (independently) best respond with A1
- Outcome: (A1, A1) → I get **4 points**

**Case 4: Neither delegates**
- Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get **4 points**

### Step 5: Delegation Game Analysis
With the mediator available, the delegation decision becomes:
- If we both delegate: 10 points each
- Any other combination: 4 points each

This creates a beneficial coordination opportunity! The worst case (4 points) equals the no-mediator outcome, while the best case (10 points) is significantly better.

### Step 6: Decision
Both mediators are identical and enable coordination on the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome. There's no downside - at worst I get 4 points (same as without), at best I get 10 points.

**I should approve both mediators.**

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2)

| My Action | P1 plays A0 | P1 plays A1 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| A0        | 10          | 2           |
| A1        | 20          | 4           |

For Player 1:
| P1's Action | When I play A0 | When I play A1 |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| A0          | 10             | 0              |
| A1          | 6              | 4              |

## Step 2: Analyze the game without mediators

- For me: A1 strictly dominates A0 (20 > 10 when P1 plays A0; 4 > 2 when P1 plays A1)
- For P1: Given I'll play A1, P1's best response is A1 (4 > 0)
- Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → payoffs of (4, 4)

## Step 3: Analyze what happens with the proposed mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

Let's examine the outcomes:

**Both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → **(10, 10)** ✓

**Only P1 delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for P1, I play my best response A1 → (4, 4)

**Only I delegate:** Mediator plays A1 for me, P1 plays best response A1 → (4, 4)

**Neither delegates:** Standard game → (A1, A1) → (4, 4)

## Step 4: Strategic analysis

From my perspective:
- If P1 delegates, I should delegate (10 > 4)
- If P1 doesn't delegate, I'm indifferent (4 = 4)

The mediator creates a **coordination device** that allows both players to commit to the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome, which we couldn't achieve in the standard game due to individual incentives to defect to A1.

## Step 5: Decision

Both mediators:
- Are functionally identical
- Enable coordination on a Pareto-superior outcome (10, 10) vs (4, 4)
- Cannot hurt me (worst case is still 4)

I should approve both to:
1. Ensure this beneficial mediator design is selected
2. Since they're identical, it doesn't matter which one wins

response:
To solve this decision-making problem in the game, we need to consider the three available actions: A0, A1, and A2. Our goal is to maximize our points, keeping in mind the payoffs, the mediator's behavior, and the likelihood of the other player’s actions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Payoff Matrix Analysis:**
   - A0, A0: 10 points for both players.
   - A0, A1: 0 points for Player 1, 20 points for Player 2.
   - A1, A0: 6 points for Player 1, 2 points for Player 2.
   - A1, A1: 4 points for both players.

2. **Mediator Analysis:**
   - If 1 player delegates, the mediator plays A1.
   - If 2 players delegate, the mediator plays A0.

   By delegating, we're shifting the game's dynamics based on how many players delegate:
   - If we delegate alone, we'll be stuck with the mediator choosing A1 regardless of the other player's action.
   - If both delegate, the mediator switches to A0, giving 10 points to both.

3. **Strategy Considerations:**
   - **A0 is dominating** when both players choose it, yielding 10 points each.
   - **Delegation** is beneficial if both players opt to delegate, resulting in the mediator playing A0.

4. **Best Response Analysis:**
   - If Player 2 is likely to choose A0, our best response is clearly A0.
   - If Player 2 is likely to delegate, then delegation or A0 are good responses.

### Probabilistic Approach:

The goal is to balance our strategy to ensure we maximize points while considering the player's tendencies:
- Direct Play (A0 and A1) has clear payoffs.
- Delegation offers the potential of automatic optimal play if both players delegate.

### Mixed Strategy:
To ensure robustness across different possible behaviors of Player 2:

1. **Probability of Direct Actions (A0 and A1):**
   - If Player 2 chooses A0, we benefit from A0.
   - If Player 2 chooses A1, winning is rare unless we choose A1 or delegate correctly.

2. **Probability of Delegating (A2):**
   - High benefit if both players choose A2.

Given these scenarios, a balanced mixed strategy can be devised:

- Allocate slightly more weight to delegating and A0 due to payoff potentials.
- Lower weight for A1, as it's less clear when it maximally benefits us.

Let's arbitrate with:
- A blend emphasizing A0 (considering non-delegating competition).
- Significant delegation for communal play potential.
- Slight rational choice towards A1.

### Final Mixed Strategy:
Considering the above, a reasonable split of actions:

```json
{"A0": 40, "A1": 20, "A2": 40}
```

This strategy ensures we're hedging our decisions effectively, leveraging direct high payoffs and the power of potential optimal mediator delegation.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix

As Player 2, my payoffs are:
- (P2: A0, P1: A0): I get **10**
- (P2: A1, P1: A0): I get **20**
- (P2: A0, P1: A1): I get **2**
- (P2: A1, P1: A1): I get **4**

### Step 2: Analyzing the Base Game (No Mediator)

For me (Player 2):
- If P1 plays A0: A1 gives 20 vs A0 gives 10 → **A1 is better**
- If P1 plays A1: A1 gives 4 vs A0 gives 2 → **A1 is better**
- **A1 is my dominant strategy**

For Player 1:
- If I play A0: A0 gives them 10 vs A1 gives 6 → prefer A0
- If I play A1: A0 gives them 0 vs A1 gives 4 → prefer A1

**Nash Equilibrium without mediator:** Both play A1 → Payoffs **(P1: 4, P2: 4)**

### Step 3: Analyzing Both Mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

### Step 4: Analyzing the Delegation Game

With either mediator present, players choose to Delegate (D) or Not (N):

- **(D, D)**: Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)**
- **(D, N)**: P1 delegates (A1), P2 plays optimally
  - P2's best response to A1 is A1 → **(4, 4)**
- **(N, D)**: P2 delegates (A1), P1 plays optimally  
  - P1's best response to A1 is A1 → **(4, 4)**
- **(N, N)**: Base game Nash → **(4, 4)**

### Step 5: Checking Nash Equilibrium with Mediator

At **(D, D)** giving (10, 10):
- If P1 deviates to N: Gets 4 < 10 ✗
- If P2 deviates to N: Gets 4 < 10 ✗

**(D, D) is a Nash equilibrium** and strictly Pareto dominates the base game outcome!

### Step 6: Decision

Since both mediators:
1. Are functionally identical
2. Enable coordination to achieve (10, 10) instead of (4, 4)
3. Improve my payoff from 4 to 10
4. Have no downside (I can choose not to delegate)

I should **approve both mediators**.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs
From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Understand the mediator mechanism
- If only 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1 for that player
- If both players delegate: mediator plays A0 for both players

## Step 3: Analyze what happens if I delegate (A2)

If I delegate while opponent plays:
- **A0**: Mediator plays A1 for me → Outcome (A1, A0) → I get 6
- **A1**: Mediator plays A1 for me → Outcome (A1, A1) → I get 4
- **A2** (also delegates): Mediator plays A0 for both → Outcome (A0, A0) → I get 10

## Step 4: Check for dominant strategies

For the opponent, let me check if they have a dominant strategy:
- Playing A1 always gives them at least 4 points
- Playing A0 gives them at most 10 points if I play A0, but only 2 if I play A1
- A1 dominates A0 for the opponent in most scenarios

## Step 5: Find the Nash equilibrium

If both players delegate:
- Both get 10 points (the mediator plays A0 for both)

Can I improve by deviating?
- If I play A0 while opponent delegates: Opponent's mediator plays A1 → I get 0
- If I play A1 while opponent delegates: Opponent's mediator plays A1 → I get 4
- Delegating gives me 10, which is better than 4 or 0

Can the opponent improve by deviating?
- If opponent plays A0 while I delegate: My mediator plays A1 → They get 2
- If opponent plays A1 while I delegate: My mediator plays A1 → They get 4  
- Delegating gives them 10, which is better than 4 or 2

## Step 6: Conclusion

Both players delegating is a Nash equilibrium where both receive 10 points - the highest mutual payoff possible. The mediator effectively coordinates us to the cooperative outcome (A0, A0).

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Payoff Matrix

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Analyze the Mediator Mechanism

The mediator:
- If only 1 player delegates → plays A1 for that player
- If both players delegate → plays A0 for both players

## Step 3: Calculate Expected Payoffs for Each Strategy

**If I play A0:**
- vs Other's A0: 10 points
- vs Other's A1: 0 points
- vs Other delegating (plays A1): 0 points

**If I play A1:**
- vs Other's A0: 6 points
- vs Other's A1: 4 points
- vs Other delegating (plays A1): 4 points

**If I delegate:**
- vs Other's A0 (I get A1): 6 points
- vs Other's A1 (I get A1): 4 points
- vs Other delegating (both get A0): **10 points**

## Step 4: Find Nash Equilibrium

Testing (Delegate, Delegate):
- If other delegates, my best response is to delegate (10 > 4 > 0)
- If I delegate, other's best response is to delegate (10 > 4 > 2)

This is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium** yielding 10 points each!

## Step 5: Check for Better Alternatives

- Maximum possible payoff for me is 10 points
- (Delegate, Delegate) achieves this maximum
- Other outcomes either aren't stable or give lower payoffs
- (A0, A0) would also give 10, but isn't a Nash equilibrium (other player would deviate to A1 for 20 points)

## Conclusion

The optimal strategy is to delegate with certainty, which leads to the Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium where both players get 10 points.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the basic payoff matrix
From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Analyze what happens when I delegate (A2)
If I delegate and the opponent:
- Plays A0: Only I delegate → mediator plays A1 for me → outcome (A1, A0) → I get 6
- Plays A1: Only I delegate → mediator plays A1 for me → outcome (A1, A1) → I get 4
- Delegates: Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → outcome (A0, A0) → I get 10

## Step 3: Compare my expected payoffs for each action
If opponent plays A0 with probability q0, A1 with probability q1, and delegates with probability q2:

- **A0**: 10·q0 + 0·q1 + 0·q2 = 10·q0
- **A1**: 6·q0 + 4·q1 + 4·q2 = 6·q0 + 4·(1-q0) = 4 + 2·q0
- **A2**: 6·q0 + 4·q1 + 10·q2

## Step 4: Analyze opponent's incentives
From Player 2's perspective, comparing their payoffs:
- Playing A0: 2 + 8·p0
- Playing A1: 4 + 16·p0  
- Delegating (A2): 4 + 16·p0

A1 and A2 give identical payoffs and both dominate A0 for any p0 ≥ 0. Therefore, a rational opponent will never play A0 (q0 = 0).

## Step 5: Recalculate my payoffs given q0 = 0
- **A0**: 0
- **A1**: 4
- **A2**: 4·q1 + 10·q2 = 4 + 6·q2

If the opponent delegates with any positive probability (q2 > 0), A2 strictly dominates both A0 and A1 for me.

## Step 6: Find the Nash Equilibrium
If I delegate (p2 = 1), the opponent's best response is to delegate (q2 = 1), giving them 10 instead of 4.

If the opponent delegates (q2 = 1), my best response is to delegate (p2 = 1), giving me 10 instead of 4.

Therefore, both players delegating is a Nash Equilibrium yielding the outcome (A0, A0) with payoffs (10, 10).

## Step 7: Strategic reasoning
- Delegating weakly dominates playing A1 directly
- The mediator was designed to coordinate both players to the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome
- Both players have symmetric incentives to delegate

**Optimal strategy: Delegate with 100% probability**

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, let's analyze the game step by step.

### 1. Identify Original Game Matrix
First, we list the payoffs based on the actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are given from Player 2's perspective (You) and Player 1's perspective (Other).

*   (P2: A0, P1: A0) → You: 10, Other: 10
*   (P2: A1, P1: A0) → You: 20, Other: 0
*   (P2: A0, P1: A1) → You: 2, Other: 6
*   (P2: A1, P1: A1) → You: 4, Other: 4

The matrix for Player 2 (P2) is:
| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A0** | 10 | 20 |
| **A1** | 2 | 4 |

The matrix for Player 1 (P1) is:
| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A0** | 10 | 0 |
| **A1** | 6 | 4 |

### 2. Analyze the Mediator (Action A2)
The mediator (A2) plays based on the number of delegations:
*   If **1 player** delegates: The mediator plays A1 for that player.
*   If **2 players** delegate: The mediator plays A0 for both players.

Now we evaluate the expanded 3x3 matrix for both players:

**Player 2's Payoffs:**
*   (A2, A0): One player (P2) delegates $\rightarrow$ (P2: A1, P1: A0) $\rightarrow$ P2 gets 20.
*   (A2, A1): One player (P2) delegates $\rightarrow$ (P2: A1, P1: A1) $\rightarrow$ P2 gets 4.
*   (A2, A2): Two players delegate $\rightarrow$ (P2: A0, P1: A0) $\rightarrow$ P2 gets 10.
*   (A0, A2): One player (P1) delegates $\rightarrow$ (P2: A0, P1: A1) $\rightarrow$ P2 gets 2.
*   (A1, A2): One player (P1) delegates $\rightarrow$ (P2: A1, P1: A1) $\rightarrow$ P2 gets 4.

**Player 1's Payoffs:**
*   (A0, A2): One player (P1) delegates $\rightarrow$ (P1: A1, P2: A0) $\rightarrow$ P1 gets 6.
*   (A1, A2): One player (P1) delegates $\rightarrow$ (P1: A1, P2: A1) $\rightarrow$ P1 gets 4.
*   (A2, A2): Two players delegate $\rightarrow$ (P1: A0, P2: A0) $\rightarrow$ P1 gets 10.
*   (A2, A0): One player (P2) delegates $\rightarrow$ (P1: A0, P2: A1) $\rightarrow$ P1 gets 0.
*   (A2, A1): One player (P2) delegates $\rightarrow$ (P1: A1, P2: A1) $\rightarrow$ P1 gets 4.

### 3. Equilibrium Analysis
For Player 2:
*   Comparing A1 and A0: A1 dominates A0 (20 > 10, 4 > 2, 4 > 2).
*   Comparing A2 and A1: A2 weakly dominates A1 (20 = 20, 4 = 4, 10 > 4).
*   Therefore, action A2 is the strongest strategy for Player 2, regardless of Player 1's choice.

For Player 1:
*   If Player 1 anticipates Player 2 will play A2 (the weakly dominant strategy), Player 1's best response is to play A2 (getting 10) rather than A1 (getting 4) or A0 (getting 0).

Since Player 1 proposed this mediator, they likely recognize that (A2, A2) creates a binding agreement to reach the cooperative (10, 10) outcome, which is superior to the (4, 4) Nash equilibrium of the basic game.

### 4. Conclusion
Action A2 (Delegate) is a weakly dominant strategy for Player 2 and leads to the highest mutually beneficial payoff in the standard Nash equilibrium of this expanded game.

Let's break down this decision step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Game Dynamics

Each player has two actions: A0 and A1. Here's the payoff matrix:

- **(A0, A0)**: Player 2 gets 10, Other player (Player 1) gets 10.
- **(A1, A0)**: Player 2 gets 20, Other player gets 0.
- **(A0, A1)**: Player 2 gets 2, Other player gets 6.
- **(A1, A1)**: Player 2 gets 4, Other player gets 4.

From this, it's apparent that cooperation (both choosing A0) yields a moderate benefit for both, whereas trying to defect (choosing A1) alone yields maximum benefit for oneself but zero for the other if the other cooperates.

### Step 2: Evaluating Mediators

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **1 delegate**: Plays A1.
- **2 delegates**: Plays A0.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- **1 delegate**: Plays A1.
- **2 delegates**: Plays A0.

Both mediators are identical in their implementation. They essentially follow this logic:
- If only one player delegates, they will default to a more aggressive (self-benefit) strategy (A1).
- If both players delegate, they opt for a cooperative strategy (A0).

### Step 3: Considering the Implications of Delegation

Understanding how these mediators act helps determine:
- If I delegate and so does the other player, we both get the cooperative outcome (A0, A0) which provides 10 points each.
- If I delegate but the other doesn't, the mediator will play A1 for me, and if the other player plays A0, I will get 20 points.
- If the other player delegates and I don't, the other player gets the mediator to play A1, and if I play A0, I only get 2 points.

### Step 4: Approval Voting Decision

Given both mediators act identically and have a cooperative incentive if both players delegate, it makes sense to approve both:

- This increases the likelihood of having a mediator present.
- Encourages mutual cooperation if both players choose to rely on mediation.

### Conclusion

We should approve both mediators as their designs align identically and promote potentially mutually beneficial outcomes if both players delegate to them. Here’s how we format our approval:

```json
{
    "M1": true,
    "M2": true
}
```

This ensures that regardless of which mediator is selected (since they are identical in behavior), you have maximized the chances of both players choosing to cooperate via delegation.

Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are Player 2 (i.e., the second player in the payoff matrix). The payoff matrix (from Player 2’s perspective) is:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-----------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                      | 10 | 2  |
| **A1**                      | 20 | 4  |

Let’s break down the payoffs:

- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → you get 10
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get 20
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 2
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → you get 4

Note:
- You prefer A1 when opponent plays A0 (20 > 10).
- But if opponent plays A1, you prefer A0 (2 > 4)? Wait — no: 2 vs 4 → A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4 → so you prefer A1 when opponent plays A1.

Wait: **2 < 4**, so if opponent plays A1, you prefer A1 (get 4) over A0 (get 2).

So:
- If opponent plays A0: you prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If opponent plays A1: you prefer A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2** — no matter what the other player does, A1 gives you more or equal points.

Let’s verify:

- Opponent A0 → your A1 gives 20, A0 gives 10 → prefer A1.
- Opponent A1 → your A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 → prefer A1.

✅ So A1 is a **strict dominant strategy** for Player 2.

Therefore, **if you act independently**, you will play A1.

But — the twist is the existence of **mediators**, and the **approval voting** step.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

You and the other player will separately approve mediators (only two: M1 by Player 1, M2 by Player 2), and the **mediator with the maximum number of approvals will be selected uniformly at random**.

Then:
- If you **delegate** to the mediator, it plays for you based on how many players delegated to it (1 or 2).
- You can choose to **act independently** or **delegate**.
- But the approval phase comes **before** delegation decisions.

So you must decide: **Which mediators do you approve**, knowing that:
- Only mediators with the most approvals will be in the running.
- The actual one used is chosen uniformly at random from the most-approved group.
- Then, you decide whether to delegate or not (but you can't control whether the mediator actually plays unless you delegate and it's selected).

But **here’s the key**: **You don’t know how many other players will delegate**, nor do you control the governance structure (approval voting). You can only vote yes/no on each mediator.

After the vote:
- The winning mediator (or one of the tied leaders) is chosen at random.
- Then you choose whether to **delegate** or **act independently**.
- But since you want to maximize your **expected payoff**, you must evaluate **what happens if the mediator is selected**.

So the logic becomes:

- You approve some mediators.
- The mediator(s) with the most approvals are selected randomly.
- You then **choose whether to delegate** or play independently.
- But if you delegate, you are **forced** to use that mediator’s action, which depends on how many players delegated.

So your **final action** depends on:
- Whether you delegate
- Which mediator is used
- How many players delegated total

Thus, **your approval decision impacts the pool of possible mediators**, and thereby affects the possible outcomes.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Mediator Designs**

Let’s label:

- **M1**: Proposed by Player 1  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0  

- **M2**: Proposed by Player 2  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A0  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A1  

We are Player 2 (self). The other player is Player 1.

We must decide which mediators to approve: M1 and M2.

Let’s consider the **expected payoff** under different delegation scenarios, and how the mediators behave.

---

### **Step 4: Consider Each Mediator's Behavior**

#### **M1 (Player 1's proposal):**
- If only **1 player** delegates → plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A0

This means:
- If only you delegate (others don’t), M1 plays A1
- If both delegate, M1 plays A0

But remember: **You are Player 2**.

So what happens depends on **your** action and the other player’s.

But your **approval decision** affects which mediator can be chosen.

Also, **you decide whether to delegate after the mediator is chosen**.

So, **the mediator only acts if you delegate to it**.

So now, we must ask: **For each possible mediator (M1, M2), if it were selected, would you choose to delegate to it? Why?**

Then: **Given that, what is the expected payoff?**

But we also must think: **What do other players do?**

The other player (Player 1) is rational, too — they will vote the same way.

But you don’t know their preferences.

However, recall that **you are Player 2**, and you are analyzing what **you** should approve.

Let’s suppose that **both players** are rational and want to maximize their *own* payoffs.

So Player 1 (opponent) will also vote strategically.

Thus, **the approval phase is strategic** — we need to reason about **what the likely outcome is**, and **which mediators you want to be available**.

---

### **Step 5: What Would You Prefer?**

Let’s analyze around each mediator.

#### **Suppose M1 is selected (Player 1’s mediator)**

- If only 1 player delegates → M1 plays **A1**
- If 2 players delegate → M1 plays **A0**

Now, **would you (Player 2) want to delegate** to M1?

Let’s consider both cases.

**Case A: You delegate to M1, and only you delegate (Player 1 doesn’t delegate)**  
→ Then, 1 person delegated → M1 plays A1. So you play A1.  
→ Opponent (Player 1) plays independently — what will they play?

Recall: **Player 1 is also rational.** What is Player 1’s dominant strategy?

Let’s write the payoff matrix **from Player 1’s perspective**:

| Their Action \ Yours (Player 2) | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | 10 | 6  |
| A1                            | 0  | 4  |

From Player 1’s view:
- If you play A0 → they get 10 (A0), 0 (A1) → prefer A0
- If you play A1 → they get 6 (A0), 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is dominant for Player 1**.

So Player 1 will play A0 unless they delegate.

So if Player 1 does **not** delegate, they play A0.

So back to Case A:  
- You delegate to M1 → M1 plays A1 (since only 1 delegate) → you play A1  
- Player 1 plays A0 (independently)  
→ Payoff: you get **20**, opponent gets 0 → **you get 20**

**Case B: You delegate to M1, and Player 1 also delegates → total 2 delegates → M1 plays A0**

→ You play A0  
→ Player 1 plays A0 (independently), because if they delegate, they are using M1, but M1 plays A0, so they get the same as playing A0 alone.

So both play A0 → you get 10

So if you delegate to M1:
- If only you delegate → you get 20
- If both delegate → you get 10

But you don’t know what Player 1 will do.

But Player 1 is rational. What would they get if they delegate?

Let’s see: If Player 1 delegates to M1:
- If only they delegate → then M1 plays A1 → they get 0 (because you play A0 or A1? No — note: if only Player 1 delegates to M1, then you play independently.

But we’re considering you delegating and them delegating.

But Player 1 wants to maximize their payoff.

How would Player 1 vote? We need to think about **what they prefer**.

But let’s focus on you: **Would you want to delegate to M1?**

From above:
- If only you delegate → you get 20
- If both delegate → you get 10
- You want to avoid the case where both delegate and you get only 10.

But if both delegate, M1 plays A0 → you get 10 (since you play A0), opponent also plays A0 → each gets 10.

Can you do better?

Alternatively, if you play independently, you can play A1 (because it’s dominant) → then:

- If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20
- If Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4

But Player 1's dominant strategy is A0 → so if you play A1 independently, and they play A0, you get 20.

But what if they also play A1? Well, they won’t — because A0 is dominant.

So: if you play independently, you get **20** (because Opponent will play A0).

Wait — that’s **better** than the 10 in the "both delegate" scenario.

But the problem is: you don’t know what Player 1 will do.

But since Player 1 will play A0 if they don’t delegate, then the **safe outcome** if you play A1 independently is **20**.

But if you delegate to M1, and Player 1 also delegates, you get 10 — worse.

And if they don’t delegate, you get 20 — same as independent.

But the risk is you get only 10 if both delegate.

So you might **prefer not to delegate**, unless the mediator guarantees better outcomes.

So: **Would you ever want to delegate to M1?**

Only if you’re sure they won’t delegate, or if M1 gives a better outcome.

But if both delegate, you get 10, but if you play independently, you can still get 20.

So that’s **worse**.

Therefore, **delegating to M1 is bad if both delegate**, and only same if only you delegate.

So your **expected payoff from delegating to M1** is **less than or equal to what you get from acting independently**.

Therefore, **you should not delegate to M1**.

Thus, **if M1 is selected, you won’t delegate** → so M1 is irrelevant to you.

So M1 is not useful.

But you could reject it.

Wait — but the **winning mediator** is selected **after** voting, and you can choose not to delegate even if it's selected.

So **you only care** about whether the mediator would **force** you into a bad outcome if you delegate.

And M1 has no benefit for you — and can hurt you in the event both delegate.

So you don’t want M1 to be available — unless you want to **free-ride** on someone else’s delegation.

But no — you’re rational.

Alternatively, if M1 were the only mediator, and you **might** want to delegate if you know the other won’t, but you can’t rely on that.

So **M1 is bad for you**.

---

#### **Now consider M2 (Player 2’s propose):**

- If 1 player delegates → M2 plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → M2 plays A1

Now, could you benefit from delegating to M2?

Again, let’s consider:

**Case A: You delegate to M2, Player 1 does not delegate**

→ Only 1 delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0

→ Player 1 plays independently → plays A0 (dominant)

→ Both play A0 → you get 10

But if you had played A1 independently, and they played A0 → you get 20 → **better**.

So by delegating to M2 in this case, you get **10**, but you could get **20** → so **worse**.

**Case B: You delegate to M2, and Player 1 also delegates**

→ 2 delegates → M2 plays A1 → you play A1

→ Player 1 plays A1 (since M2 plays A1 for both)

→ Both play A1 → you get 4

But if you had played independently, you’d get 4 anyway (since you play A1, opponent plays A0 → 20? Wait no.

Wait: if you play A1 and they play A0 → you get 20.

But in this case, if both delegate to M2 → M2 plays A1 → both play A1 → you get 4.

But if you had played independently (A1), and they played A0 → you get 20.

So again, **delegating to M2 in this case gives you only 4**, but you could get 20.

So **you never benefit from delegating to M2**.

Let’s summarize:

- If only you delegate: M2 plays A0 → you get 10; but if you play A1 independently, you get 20 → so worse.
- If both delegate: M2 plays A1 → you get 4; but if you play A1 independently, you’ve got 20 (if they play A0) → still worse.

So **in all cases, delegating to M2 hurts you**.

Therefore, you should **not delegate to M2** if it’s selected.

So M2 is also bad?

Wait — this is a problem. **Both mediators are bad for you?**

But you must approve at least one?

The winning mediator is chosen from those with maximum approvals.

So if you approve **both**, and Player 1 approves **both**, then both have 2 approvals → any of them can be selected (randomly).

But you won’t delegate to either.

So it doesn’t matter — you play independently → you get **20** (since Player 1 plays A0).

But if you approve **only one**, and Player 1 approves **only one**, then that one wins.

But suppose:

You approve **only M1**, Player 1 approves only M2 → then each has 1 approval → so both are tied? No — maximum is 1 → both are in running → chosen randomly.

But you won’t delegate anyway.

So it doesn't matter.

But suppose you approve **only M2**, and Player 1 approves **only M2**, then M2 wins.

But you don’t delegate → you play A1 → get 20.

Likewise, if only M1 is approved → you don’t delegate → get 20.

So as long as *you* don't delegate, the choice of mediator doesn't matter.

But now we hit a key point: **If the mediator is selected, but you don’t delegate, it doesn’t affect you at all**.

So **your payoff depends only on your own action and the other’s action**, which is A1 vs A0.

And since Player 1 plays A0, you play A1 → you get 20.

So the mediator system is **irrelevant as long as you don’t delegate**.

Therefore, **you should never delegate to any mediator**, because both M1 and M2 can only give you less than or equal to 20.

So the **only thing that matters** is whether the **mediator is available** or not — but since you won’t use it anyway, **you only care about whether you can block bad mediators**.

But both mediators are bad — but they don’t hurt you unless you delegate.

So **you don’t care**.

But wait — here’s a twist: **Suppose you approve a mediator, and it wins, and then Player 1 also approves it, and you don’t delegate — so it’s fine.**

So why would you disapprove one?

But maybe **Player 1** might delegate to a mediator that benefits them.

Wait — but **you** are Player 2.

Suppose **M1 is approved by you**, and **Player 1 is also likely to approve M1**.

Then M1 might be selected.

But if M1 is selected, and you **don’t delegate**, it doesn’t affect you.

So still fine.

But what if **you approve M1, and Player 1 approves M1, and Player 1 then delegates to M1?**

Then:
- 2 delegates → M1 plays A0
- So Player 1 gets A0
- You play independently → A1
- So you get 20
- They get 0

But Player 1 doesn’t want to get 0 — they want to get at least 6 or 10.

But if they delegate to M1 and both delegate → M1 plays A0 → they get 10 (since you play A1 → they get 0?) Wait.

Wait: if both delegate to M1, M1 plays A0 → both play A0 → so both get 10.

Wait! Let’s go back.

**M1:**
- 1 delegate → plays A1
- 2 delegates → plays A0

So if **both delegate** to M1 → it plays A0 → both play A0 → both get 10.

But if Player 1 delegates to M1 and both delegate, they get 10.

But if they **don’t delegate**, they play independently, and **you play A1**, so they get 4 (since you play A1, they play A0 → they get 6? Wait).

Let’s double-check.

Payoffs (from Player 1’s perspective):
- You: A1, they: A0 → they get 6
- You: A1, they: A1 → they get 4
- You: A0, they: A0 → 10
- You: A0, they: A1 → 0

Wait — earlier I said A0 is dominant for Player 1.

Check:
- If you play A0 → they get 10 (A0), 0 (A1) → prefer A0
- If you play A1 → they get 6 (A0), 4 (A1) → prefer A0

Yes — so A0 is dominant → they prefer to play A0.

But if you play A1, and they play A0 → they get 6.

If they delegate to M1 and both delegate → M1 plays A0 → both play A0 → they get 10.

That’s **better** than 6.

Ah! So **if both delegate to M1**, they get 10, which is better than 6.

So **Player 1 might want to delegate to M1**.

In fact, **if you play A1**, then:
- If Player 1 plays A0 independently → they get 6
- If Player 1 delegates to M1 and both delegate → M1 plays A0 → both A0 → they get 10

So **they prefer to delegate to M1**.

So **if M1 is available and approved**, and they know you play A1, they will **delegate to M1** to get 10 instead of 6.

So Player 1 will **only delegate to M1** if they can get more than 6.

But if you play A0, then they get 0 if they play A1, 10 if they play A0.

But if you play A0, and they delegate to M1 and both delegate → M1 plays A0 → both play A0 → they get 10.

Still better than 0.

So **in all cases**, if M1 is selected and Player 1 delegates, they get 10 if both play A0, which is better than the 6 or 0 they otherwise get.

So **Player 1 will always want to delegate to M1** if M1 is available.

But you don’t care — because if they delegate to M1 and both delegate → M1 plays A0 → you play A0 → but wait!

You play independently — you haven’t delegated.

So if both delegate to M1 → M1 plays A0 → you are **not** using M1, so you play independently.

So your action depends on whether you delegate or not.

You haven’t delegated → you play independently.

But you **want to play A1**, because it’s dominant.

But if Player 1 delegates to M1 and both delegate → M1 plays A0 → so they play A0.

Now, what do you play?

You play A1 (because A1 is dominant), so:
- You: A1
- Player 1: A0 (from M1)
→ You get 20

Still good.

But if you had played A0 instead, you’d get 2, so no.

So you still get 20.

But Player 1 gets 0? No.

Wait: you play A1, they play A0 → from Player 1’s perspective: **you are A1, they are A0 → they get 6**, yes.

But if they delegate to M1 and both delegate → M1 plays A0 → they get 10.

Contradiction?

No: **only if both delegate, M1 plays A0** → so **both** play A0.

But you are **not delegating** → you play independently.

So **you are not playing A0** unless you choose to.

So even if M1 plays A0 due to two delegates, that **only affects the delegate**.

The **non-delegate** plays independently.

So:

- If you do **not** delegate:
  - Your action is A1 (dominant)
  - If Player 1 delegates to M1 and both delegate → M1 plays A0 → so they play A0
  - You play A1
  → You get 20, they get 6

But Player 1 could get 6 from playing A0 independently.

But earlier I thought they could get 10 by playing A0 via M1.

But **no** — if **you are not delegating**, and **they delegate to M1**, then **only one person delegates** → so M1 plays A1.

Ah! **Critical point**.

M1:
- 1 delegate → plays A1
- 2 delegates → plays A0

So if **only Player 1 delegates to M1**, then M1 plays A1 → so **they play A1**.

But they are rational → they know if they play A1, and you play A1 → they get 4.

But if they play A0 independently, you play A1 → they get 6.

So 6 > 4 — so they prefer not to delegate.

If they delegate alone → M1 plays A1 → they play A1 → get 4

But if they play A0 independently → get 6

So **they would not delegate to M1 alone**.

If they delegate **and you do too**, then M1 plays A0 → they play A0 → get 10 (since you play A1 → 6? Wait).

Wait: If both delegate, M1 plays A0 → both play A0 → so they get 10.

But if you play A1, they play A0 → they get 6.

But if both play A0, they get 10.

So yes, 10 > 6 → so **if they can coordinate with you**, they prefer to delegate to M1.

But if they delegate and you don’t, they get only 4 < 6.

So they **only want to delegate if you also delegate**.

But you are rational too.

Would you want to delegate to M1?

Only if D1: you delegate, they delegate → M1 plays A0 → you play A0 → you get 10

But if you play A1 independently, you get 20

So 10 < 20 — you **don’t** want to delegate.

So you will not delegate.

Therefore, Player 1 knows: if they delegate to M1, and you don't, they get 4 (because M1 plays A1), but if they play A0 independently, they get 6.

So they will not delegate.

And they won't cooperate in delegate.

So **M1 is never used**.

Similarly for M2.

Let’s check M2:

- 1 delegate → plays A0
- 2 delegates → plays A1

If Player 1 delegates to M2 alone → M2 plays A0 → they play A0 → get 6 (if you play A1) — same as playing A0 independently.

But if they play A0 independently, they get 6.

So no gain.

If both delegate → M2 plays A1 → they play A1 → so you get 4, they get 4.

But if you play A1 independently, you get 20.

So they get 4, but if they play A0 independently, they get 6.

So 4 < 6 — they **don’t want to delegate**.

So **Player 1 will never delegate to either mediator**, because:
- M1 alone: they get 4 < 6
- M2 alone: they get 6 = 6, but if both delegate, they get 4 < 6

So **no incentive to delegate**.

Therefore, **in any case, Player 1 will play A0 independently**.

You will play A1 independently → you get 20.

So mediators are **irrelevant**.

But now, back to the **approval phase**.

You must decide which mediators to approve.

Since mediators are not used, and your payoff is always 20 regardless, does it matter?

Yes — **if you approve a mediator, and it becomes available, and you don’t delegate, it’s still fine**.

But if **you disapprove a mediator**, and it is the only one approved, then the mediator might not be available — but you don’t care.

But suppose the other player approves a mediator you don’t like.

But you can vote independently.

But the **winning mediator** is chosen at random from the ones with maximum approvals.

So if you approve **only M1**, and Player 1 approves only M2, then both have 1 approval (max is 1) → both are in the running → chosen uniformly at random.

But you won’t delegate → so it doesn’t matter.

But suppose Player 1 approves **both**, and you approve **only M1**, then M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

But you don’t care.

So **you can approve both, or neither, or one, and it doesn't affect your outcome**.

But — **is there any reason to disapprove a mediator?**

Only if you want to **limit the pool** or something.

But since you get 20 no matter what, and no delegation happens, **the choice of mediator doesn't matter**.

So you can approve whichever you want.

But to be safe, you might want to approve **only mediators that are safe**.

But both are equivalent.

Wait — but consider this:

Suppose you approve **only M2**, and Player 1 approves only M2.

Then M2 is the only one with approval, so it wins.

No problem.

But suppose you approve **only M1**, and Player 1 approves only M2, then M1 and M2 are both tied for max (1), so randomly chosen — still fine.

So **no incentive to disapprove**.

But the question is: **which ones do you approve?**

You are Player 2.

Will you approve the mediator proposed by Player 2?

That's M2.

And the one proposed by Player 1, M1?

You are Player 2, so you might **trust your own mediator**.

But both are symmetric in effect.

But there's a deeper point.

Let’s suppose you approve **both**.

Then, even if Player 1 approves only one, you still have both in competition.

But if you approve **neither**, then no mediator is approved.

Then who is the winner?

The problem says: "the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

If no one approves any mediator, then maximum approval is 0 — but no mediator has approval? Then no mediator wins.

But the game still has to happen.

The problem says: "you will have the option to delegate to a mediator."

But if no mediator is approved, you may not have any to delegate to.

But the **majority rule**: if no mediator is approved, maybe no mediator is available, so you must act independently.

But the problem doesn't specify.

It says: "the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if **no mediator has any approvals**, then there is no winning mediator.

But then what happens?

You might not be able to delegate.

But you can still act independently.

So probably, you can still play, but not delegate.

So if you approve no one, and others approve no one, you play independently.

Still get 20.

But if you approve **both**, you ensure that there is at least one approved mediator.

But it doesn't matter.

But if you disapprove one, and the other is approved, it’s fine.

But here’s a risk.

Suppose you **disapprove M1**, and Player 1 only approves M1.

Then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 0.

So M1 wins.

But you don’t delegate → so it doesn’t affect you.

So still fine.

So **you can approve both with no risk**.

But why would you disapprove?

Unless you dislike M1.

But the only thing is: **M1 is proposed by Player 1**, and you are Player 2.

But you are only concerned with your own payoff.

So there's **no reason to disapprove either**.

Moreover, **approving both ensures that if the other player approves only one, and you approve both, then at least one has max approvals**.

But it doesn't matter.

But to be safe, it’s better to approve both.

But wait — suppose you approve only M2, and Player 1 approves only M1.

Then M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → both are tied → chosen randomly.

But you are Player 2, and you might prefer that M2 wins, but you have no choice.

But since you don’t delegate anyway, it doesn’t matter.

So **no strategic reason to disapprove**.

But let’s think about the **Mediator Proposer's Incentives**.

Player 1 is proposing M1.

Player 1 wants to benefit.

But from our analysis, Player 1 will not delegate to any mediator.

So M1 is worthless to them.

Similarly, M2 is proposed by you — but if you don’t delegate, it doesn't help.

So both mediators are effectively useless.

But **you might as well approve both**, to ensure that the system works.

Or to show solidarity with your own proposal.

But strictly, for payoff maximization, **it doesn’t matter**.

But the question is: **which ones do you approve?**

And you must return a JSON.

The safest choice is to approve both.

But is there any reason to disapprove one?

Only if you think that if a particular mediator wins, and if you were to delegate, you might get less — but you won’t delegate anyway.

So **no**.

**Conclusion: approve both mediators.**

Final answer:

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}
```

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
Both proposed mediators implement the exact same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that delegating player.
- If both players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

Since there is no strategic difference between selecting M1 vs M2 (they induce the same outcomes for any delegation pattern), I’m indifferent between them. Approving both weakly dominates approving only one because it cannot lead to a worse mediator being selected (there isn’t a “worse” one here), and it avoids any needless tie-breaking reliance.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understanding my payoff structure
As Player 2, my payoffs are:
- Against A0: I get 10 (if I play A0) or 20 (if I play A1)
- Against A1: I get 2 (if I play A0) or 4 (if I play A1)

### Step 2: Analyzing direct actions
Notice that A1 strictly dominates A0 for me:
- When opponent plays A0: 20 > 10
- When opponent plays A1: 4 > 2

So playing A0 directly is never optimal.

### Step 3: Understanding the mediator mechanism
The mediator:
- Plays **A1** when exactly 1 player delegates
- Plays **A0** when both players delegate

### Step 4: Calculating expected payoffs for delegation (A2)
If I delegate:
- If opponent plays A0 (only I delegate): Mediator plays A1 for me → I get 20
- If opponent plays A1 (only I delegate): Mediator plays A1 for me → I get 4  
- If opponent delegates (both delegate): Mediator plays A0 for both → I get 10

### Step 5: Identifying Nash equilibria

**Equilibrium 1: Both delegate (A2, A2)**
- Both players get 10 points
- If opponent delegates, my best response is to delegate (10 > 4)

**Equilibrium 2: Both play A1**
- Both players get 4 points
- Less favorable than mutual delegation

**Other mixed equilibria exist but yield lower payoffs**

### Step 6: Strategic reasoning
Player 1 proposed this mediator, which creates a coordination mechanism that benefits both players. The mediator is specifically designed to:
- Reward mutual delegation (both get 10)
- Ensure reasonable outcomes when only one delegates (4 or 20)

The Pareto-dominant equilibrium is clearly **(A2, A2)** where both players delegate and receive 10 points each—better than any other equilibrium outcome.

### Conclusion
Given that:
1. Mutual delegation yields the highest symmetric payoff (10 each)
2. Player 1 proposed this mediator, signaling intent to coordinate
3. This is the focal Pareto-optimal equilibrium

The rational strategy is to delegate with certainty.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game Payoffs (from my perspective as Player 1)
- (A0, A0): 10 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points  
- (A1, A0): 6 points
- (A1, A1): 4 points

## Step 2: Understand the Mediator Rules
- If only I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me
- If only Player 2 delegates: Mediator plays A1 for them
- If both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both

## Step 3: Calculate My Expected Payoffs for Each Pure Strategy

**If I play A0:**
- vs Player 2's A0: 10 points
- vs Player 2's A1: 0 points
- vs Player 2's A2 (delegate): 0 points (mediator plays A1 for them)

**If I play A1:**
- vs Player 2's A0: 6 points
- vs Player 2's A1: 4 points
- vs Player 2's A2: 4 points (mediator plays A1 for them → result is A1 vs A1)

**If I play A2 (delegate):**
- vs Player 2's A0: 6 points (mediator plays A1 for me → result is A1 vs A0)
- vs Player 2's A1: 4 points (mediator plays A1 for me → result is A1 vs A1)
- vs Player 2's A2: 10 points (both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both)

## Step 4: Compare Strategies

Comparing A2 (delegate) vs A1:
- Against A0: 6 = 6 (tied)
- Against A1: 4 = 4 (tied)
- Against A2: 10 > 4 (strictly better!)

**A2 weakly dominates A1** - it's never worse and sometimes strictly better.

Both A1 and A2 dominate A0 (A0 only gives 10 vs opponent's A0, but gets 0 vs opponent's A1 or A2).

## Step 5: Analyze Nash Equilibrium

If both players delegate (A2, A2):
- Result: (A0, A0) giving (10, 10)
- If I deviate to A1: I get 4 (worse)
- If I deviate to A0: I get 0 (worse)
- Same logic applies to Player 2

(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium and Pareto optimal.

## Step 6: Rational Choice

Since:
1. Delegating weakly dominates playing A1
2. (A2, A2) is the best mutual outcome (10, 10)
3. Even if Player 2 doesn't delegate, I'm no worse off delegating than playing A1

The optimal strategy is to delegate with probability 100%.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which mediators to approve, based on **maximizing your expected points** as **Player 2**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (without delegation)**

We are Player 2. The payoff matrix (from Player 2's perspective) is:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-----------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                      | 10       | 2        |
| **A1**                      | 20       | 4        |

This is a **non-zero-sum game**. Let’s analyze the strategic incentives.

#### Best Response Analysis (Player 2):
- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You get: 10 (if A0), 20 (if A1) → **Best to play A1**
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You get: 2 (if A0), 4 (if A1) → **Best to play A1**

So, **A1 is a weakly dominant strategy for Player 2** — no matter what Player 1 does, you get at least as much, and more in one case, by choosing A1.

**Conclusion**: As Player 2, your best pure strategy is A1.

But: if you delegate, the mediator will act based on the number of delegations. So we must consider what happens when actions are delegated.

---

### **Step 2: Understand Delegation and Mediators**

You can:
- Delegate to a mediator, or
- Act independently.

The **mediator’s action** depends on how many **players** have delegated to it (0, 1, or 2). So:
- If **0** people choose the mediator: not relevant.
- If **1** person delegates: mediator plays according to its rule for "1 player".
- If **2** people delegate: mediator plays according to its rule for "2 players".

You and the other player choose **simultaneously** whether to delegate or not, and also choose **which mediator** to approve (via voting).

> Important: You are choosing **which mediators to approve**, and the **winning mediator** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with **maximum approval**.

So: your approval decision affects **which mediators are in the game**, and thus affects the final outcome (since the winning mediator will be used).

We have two proposed mediators:

---

### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A1

---

### **Step 3: Strategic Considerations**

You care about **maximizing your own expected payoff**, which depends on:
1. Whether you delegate or not.
2. Whether the other player delegates or not.
3. Which mediator wins (based on approval voting).
4. What the mediator does in each case.

But the **mediator is selected after** you approve it — you don’t know which one will win. However, the **winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with the most approvals**.

So, your approval decision shapes the **set of possible mediators** that might be used.

Your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff across all possible combinations of delegation choices and mediator selection**.

Let’s consider your **best strategy** under delegation, depending on **which mediator is used**.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Each Mediator for Player 2 (You)**

Assume you are acting as **Player 2**, and you are deciding whether to delegate or not. The mediator’s choice depends on **how many** of you and the other player delegate.

Let’s analyze each mediator case by case.

---

#### 🔹 Case 1: M1 is used (Player 1’s mediator)

- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

So:
- If **only you delegate**, M1 plays A1
- If **only other player delegates**, M1 plays A1
- If **both delegate**, M1 plays A0
- If **neither**, you pick independently.

Now, consider what happens based on your and the other player’s actions.

But note: **You are trying to maximize your payoff, and you are Player 2**.

Let’s consider **your best response under M1**:

| Your Choice \ Other's Choice | Delegate (M1) | Not Delegate |
|------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Delegate (M1)**            | M1: 2 delegates → A0 | M1: 1 delegate → A1 |
| **Not Delegate**             | M1: 1 delegate → A1 | M1: 0 delegates → You play as you wish |

Let’s now consider your optimal choice under each scenario.

First, suppose **M1 is used**.

- If **you delegate**, then:
  - If other player delegates → both delegate → M1 plays A0 → you get whatever you get when you play A0
  - If other player does **not** delegate → only you delegate → M1 plays A1 → you get A1 payoff
- If **you do not delegate**, you can choose your own action.

Let’s explore cases.

##### Subcase: You delegate → M1
- If other player also delegates → M1 plays A0 → you play A0
- If other player doesn’t delegate → M1 plays A1 → you play A1

So your payoff depends on the other player.

But the other player is trying to **maximize their own payoff**, as Player 1.

So we need to consider **what Player 1 would do** if M1 is used and you delegate.

This becomes a game-theoretic loop. But let’s take a different approach.

Instead of solving the full Bayesian game, let’s **evaluate the expected outcome under each mediator** and see which one gives you more **security** or **higher expected value**, especially assuming **rational behavior**.

But even better: let’s **analyze what the mediator does in each delegation scenario** and whether that helps **you** as Player 2.

Let’s recall your **dominant strategy** is A1. So you want to choose A1 if possible.

But — if we delegate to a mediator, we may lose control.

So **you want to delegate only if it helps you get A1 in more cases than you would otherwise**.

---

#### 🔹 Try M1: When 2 players delegate → A0, when 1 → A1

So:
- If **you delegate and other doesn’t**, you get A1 → good (since A1 gives you 20 vs A0’s 10)
- If **other delegates and you don’t**, you get A1 → good
- If **both delegate**, you get A0 → bad (you get only 10 instead of 20, and other gets 10 instead of 0)
- If **neither**, you can choose A1 → so you get 20

So: **M1 is dangerous when both delegate**, because you are forced into A0, which is bad for you.

But if only one delegates, you both get A1 → but that’s **not possible** unless the other player delegates and you don’t, or vice versa.

Wait — if **only one delegates**, the mediator plays A1 → so the **delegating player** gets what A1 gives them.

But remember: **who is delegating**?

Let’s suppose **only you delegate** → M1 plays A1 → so **you play A1**

Other player **does not delegate** → they play independently.

Now, if other player plays A0 → you get 20 (A1 vs A0) → good
If other player plays A1 → you get 4

But other player **prefers A0** if you play A1? Let's check:

Payoffs for **Player 1**:
- If you play A0 → they get 10 (A0 vs A0), or 2 (A0 vs A1)
- If you play A1 → they get 0 (A1 vs A0), or 4 (A1 vs A1)

So Player 1 prefers:
- If you play A0: they prefer A0 (10 > 2)
- If you play A1: they prefer A1 (4 > 0)

So if **you play A1**, Player 1 will choose A1 → you both get 4

But if you **delegate to M1**, and you are the only one, then M1 plays A1 → you play A1 → so Player 1 gets a payoff of 4 if they play A1, or 0 if A0 → so they will play A1

Thus, **if you delegate alone to M1**, you get A1, Player 1 plays A1 → you get **4 points**

But if you had **not delegated**, and played A1 yourself, then:
- You play A1
- Player 1 plays A1 → you still get **4**

So no difference.

But if **you don't delegate**, and you play A1, and Player 1 plays A1, you get 4.

Same as above.

Wait. But suppose **you don't delegate**, and you play A1.

Then:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20
- But Player 1 won’t play A0, because if you play A1, they get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → so **they prefer A1**

So they will play A1 → you get 4

So **if you choose A1 regardless**, you get 4.

Now, if you delegate to M1 and you are alone → you still get A1 → same result

So no difference.

But now, **if both delegate to M1**, M1 plays A0 → so you play A0.

Player 1 also delegated → they play A0.

Then: you both get 10

You get 10, which is **worse than 4**.

So if you delegate to M1, and Player 1 also delegates, you get 10 instead of 4 → you get **worse**.

So: **delegating to M1 when both delegate is bad for you**.

But what if you don’t delegate? Then you are free to play A1 → agree that you get 4.

So M1 is **dangerous** if both choose it.

But M1 also gives A1 when **only one delegates**, so you get A1.

But since you can get A1 anyway, you don't benefit.

The **risk is that both might choose M1**, and you get A0 → you lose.

So M1 gives you **more risk** when both delegate.

But you want to avoid that.

Now let’s check M2.

---

#### 🔹 M2 (Player 2’s mediator): Proposed by Player 2

- 1 delegate → A0
- 2 delegates → A1

So:
- If only one delegates → A0
- If two delegate → A1

Now, consider scenarios.

##### Case 1: You delegate to M2, other does not
- Only you delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0

Player 1 does not delegate → they choose their own action.

If they play A0 → you get 10
If they play A1 → you get 2

But if you play A0, Player 1 will rationally play A0 (10 > 2), so both get 10

So you get 10

But if you had not delegated, you could play A1 → then Player 1 would play A1 → you get 4

So now, if you delegate to M2 and are alone, you get **10**, which is **better than 4**

Wait — this is good!

So playing A0 by M2 is better than playing A1 for you **if Player 1 plays A0**

But will Player 1 play A0 if you are playing A0?

Yes — because if you play A0, Player 1 gets:
- 10 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → so they play A0

So if you delegate to M2 and you're alone, you're forced into A0 → Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10

But if you had played A1 yourself, you'd get 4

→ So **you get 10 > 4** → **better to delegate when alone to M2**

##### Case 2: Other player delegates to M2, you don’t
- Only other player delegates → M2 plays A0 → so Player 1 plays A0
- You play independently

You get:
- If you play A0: 10
- If you play A1: 20

So you will play A1 → get 20

So you get 20

Again, **better than if you had played A0 yourself**

Wait — this is even better.

So if you don’t delegate, and other delegates to M2, you get A0 from other player, so you get 20 by playing A1.

##### Case 3: Both delegate to M2
- Both delegate → M2 plays A1 → so you play A1
- Player 1 also plays A1

Then you get 4

But if neither delegated, both would play A1 (because A1 is dominant) → you still get 4

Same

So no difference.

But crucially: if **both delegate**, you get 4, same as without delegation.

Now, compare with **not delegating**:
- You play A1, Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4

Same

So delegation to M2 has:

- If you delegate, other doesn’t: you play A0 → get 10
- If other delegates, you don’t: you play A1 → get 20
- If both delegate: you play A1 → get 4
- If neither: you play A1 → get 4

So **you benefit in both asymmetric cases** (only you or only other delegate to M2), and same if both or neither.

So **M2 is beneficial or neutral for you** in every case.

In fact, **you are strictly better off when the delegation is unbalanced** — you get 10 or 20 instead of 4.

Even when both delegate, you get same as independent.

So **M2 is strictly better for you** in all cases, or at least not worse, and better in some.

Now compare M1:

- M1: 1 delegate → A1; 2 delegates → A0

If you delegate alone → you play A1 → you get 4 (since other plays A1)
If other delegates alone → you play A1 → you get 4
If both → you play A0 → you get 10
If neither → you play A1 → get 4

So in this case:
- If both delegate: you get 10 → better than 4
- If only one delegate: you get 4 → same as free play
- So M1 is **only better when both delegate**

But if both delegate to M1, you get 10 → good

But will both want to delegate?

Player 1’s incentives:

- M1: 1 delegate → A1; 2 delegates → A0
- If Player 1 delegates alone → they play A1 → opponent plays A1 → they get 4
- If opponent delegates alone → Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4
- If both → Player 1 plays A0 → they get 10 → good
- If neither → Player 1 plays A1 → gets 4

So **Player 1 benefits from both delegating** — 10 > 4

So Player 1 has **incentive to delegate if they think you will**

But you? You get 10 only if both delegate.

But you also get 4 if only one delegates.

So you get **10 if both delegate**, 4 otherwise

So your expected payoff depends on what happens.

But now, **you are deciding whether to approve the mediator**, and both mediators may be approved.

But the **winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve **both**, and Player 1 approves only M1, then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 2 → M2 wins.

Wait — you don’t control the other player’s approvals.

But you are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**, so you must consider that:

- The winning mediator depends on **approval counts**
- Both you and the other player approve mediators
- You don’t know what Player 1 will do.

But you can assume that **Player 1 is rational and self-interested**, and will approve **mediators that help them**.

So let’s model their incentives.

---

### **Step 5: Player 1 (other player) Approval Behavior**

Player 1 wants to maximize **their own payoff**.

Let’s analyze what **M1 and M2** do from **Player 1’s perspective**.

#### M1 (Player 1’s proposed mediator):
- 1 delegate → A1 (so Player 1 plays A1 if they delegate alone)
- 2 delegates → A0 (so both play A0)

So:
- If only Player 1 delegates → plays A1 → you play A1 (as Player 2) → Player 1 gets 0
- If only you delegate → M1 plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1 → gets 4
- If both → A0 → both get 10 → Player 1 gets 10
- If neither → Player 1 plays A1 → gets 4

So Player 1 gets:
- 0 (if only Player 1 delegates)
- 4 (if only you delegate)
- 10 (if both delegate)
- 4 (if neither)

So Player 1’s best outcome is **both delegate** (10), and **worst is only they delegate** (0).

So Player 1 will want to **induce the other player to delegate**, so that both end up delegating → they get 10.

But if both delegate, they are forced to A0 — which is better for them than playing A1 → 10 > 4

So Player 1 **wants to get you to delegate**, so they can both delegate and get 10.

Therefore, **Player 1 will approve M1**, because it gives them 10 if both delegate, and **if you delegate, they get 4**, which is better than 0.

But they **won’t benefit** if you don’t delegate and they do → they get 0 → bad.

So they want **you to delegate**.

Will they approve M2?

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry


Your previous response was:
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which mediators to approve, based on **maximizing your expected points** as **Player 2**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (without delegation)**

We are Player 2. The payoff matrix (from Player 2's perspective) is:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-----------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                      | 10       | 2        |
| **A1**                      | 20       | 4        |

This is a **non-zero-sum game**. Let’s analyze the strategic incentives.

#### Best Response Analysis (Player 2):
- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You get: 10 (if A0), 20 (if A1) → **Best to play A1**
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You get: 2 (if A0), 4 (if A1) → **Best to play A1**

So, **A1 is a weakly dominant strategy for Player 2** — no matter what Player 1 does, you get at least as much, and more in one case, by choosing A1.

**Conclusion**: As Player 2, your best pure strategy is A1.

But: if you delegate, the mediator will act based on the number of delegations. So we must consider what happens when actions are delegated.

---

### **Step 2: Understand Delegation and Mediators**

You can:
- Delegate to a mediator, or
- Act independently.

The **mediator’s action** depends on how many **players** have delegated to it (0, 1, or 2). So:
- If **0** people choose the mediator: not relevant.
- If **1** person delegates: mediator plays according to its rule for "1 player".
- If **2** people delegate: mediator plays according to its rule for "2 players".

You and the other player choose **simultaneously** whether to delegate or not, and also choose **which mediator** to approve (via voting).

> Important: You are choosing **which mediators to approve**, and the **winning mediator** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with **maximum approval**.

So: your approval decision affects **which mediators are in the game**, and thus affects the final outcome (since the winning mediator will be used).

We have two proposed mediators:

---

### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A1

---

### **Step 3: Strategic Considerations**

You care about **maximizing your own expected payoff**, which depends on:
1. Whether you delegate or not.
2. Whether the other player delegates or not.
3. Which mediator wins (based on approval voting).
4. What the mediator does in each case.

But the **mediator is selected after** you approve it — you don’t know which one will win. However, the **winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with the most approvals**.

So, your approval decision shapes the **set of possible mediators** that might be used.

Your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff across all possible combinations of delegation choices and mediator selection**.

Let’s consider your **best strategy** under delegation, depending on **which mediator is used**.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Each Mediator for Player 2 (You)**

Assume you are acting as **Player 2**, and you are deciding whether to delegate or not. The mediator’s choice depends on **how many** of you and the other player delegate.

Let’s analyze each mediator case by case.

---

#### 🔹 Case 1: M1 is used (Player 1’s mediator)

- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

So:
- If **only you delegate**, M1 plays A1
- If **only other player delegates**, M1 plays A1
- If **both delegate**, M1 plays A0
- If **neither**, you pick independently.

Now, consider what happens based on your and the other player’s actions.

But note: **You are trying to maximize your payoff, and you are Player 2**.

Let’s consider **your best response under M1**:

| Your Choice \ Other's Choice | Delegate (M1) | Not Delegate |
|------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Delegate (M1)**            | M1: 2 delegates → A0 | M1: 1 delegate → A1 |
| **Not Delegate**             | M1: 1 delegate → A1 | M1: 0 delegates → You play as you wish |

Let’s now consider your optimal choice under each scenario.

First, suppose **M1 is used**.

- If **you delegate**, then:
  - If other player delegates → both delegate → M1 plays A0 → you get whatever you get when you play A0
  - If other player does **not** delegate → only you delegate → M1 plays A1 → you get A1 payoff
- If **you do not delegate**, you can choose your own action.

Let’s explore cases.

##### Subcase: You delegate → M1
- If other player also delegates → M1 plays A0 → you play A0
- If other player doesn’t delegate → M1 plays A1 → you play A1

So your payoff depends on the other player.

But the other player is trying to **maximize their own payoff**, as Player 1.

So we need to consider **what Player 1 would do** if M1 is used and you delegate.

This becomes a game-theoretic loop. But let’s take a different approach.

Instead of solving the full Bayesian game, let’s **evaluate the expected outcome under each mediator** and see which one gives you more **security** or **higher expected value**, especially assuming **rational behavior**.

But even better: let’s **analyze what the mediator does in each delegation scenario** and whether that helps **you** as Player 2.

Let’s recall your **dominant strategy** is A1. So you want to choose A1 if possible.

But — if we delegate to a mediator, we may lose control.

So **you want to delegate only if it helps you get A1 in more cases than you would otherwise**.

---

#### 🔹 Try M1: When 2 players delegate → A0, when 1 → A1

So:
- If **you delegate and other doesn’t**, you get A1 → good (since A1 gives you 20 vs A0’s 10)
- If **other delegates and you don’t**, you get A1 → good
- If **both delegate**, you get A0 → bad (you get only 10 instead of 20, and other gets 10 instead of 0)
- If **neither**, you can choose A1 → so you get 20

So: **M1 is dangerous when both delegate**, because you are forced into A0, which is bad for you.

But if only one delegates, you both get A1 → but that’s **not possible** unless the other player delegates and you don’t, or vice versa.

Wait — if **only one delegates**, the mediator plays A1 → so the **delegating player** gets what A1 gives them.

But remember: **who is delegating**?

Let’s suppose **only you delegate** → M1 plays A1 → so **you play A1**

Other player **does not delegate** → they play independently.

Now, if other player plays A0 → you get 20 (A1 vs A0) → good
If other player plays A1 → you get 4

But other player **prefers A0** if you play A1? Let's check:

Payoffs for **Player 1**:
- If you play A0 → they get 10 (A0 vs A0), or 2 (A0 vs A1)
- If you play A1 → they get 0 (A1 vs A0), or 4 (A1 vs A1)

So Player 1 prefers:
- If you play A0: they prefer A0 (10 > 2)
- If you play A1: they prefer A1 (4 > 0)

So if **you play A1**, Player 1 will choose A1 → you both get 4

But if you **delegate to M1**, and you are the only one, then M1 plays A1 → you play A1 → so Player 1 gets a payoff of 4 if they play A1, or 0 if A0 → so they will play A1

Thus, **if you delegate alone to M1**, you get A1, Player 1 plays A1 → you get **4 points**

But if you had **not delegated**, and played A1 yourself, then:
- You play A1
- Player 1 plays A1 → you still get **4**

So no difference.

But if **you don't delegate**, and you play A1, and Player 1 plays A1, you get 4.

Same as above.

Wait. But suppose **you don't delegate**, and you play A1.

Then:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20
- But Player 1 won’t play A0, because if you play A1, they get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → so **they prefer A1**

So they will play A1 → you get 4

So **if you choose A1 regardless**, you get 4.

Now, if you delegate to M1 and you are alone → you still get A1 → same result

So no difference.

But now, **if both delegate to M1**, M1 plays A0 → so you play A0.

Player 1 also delegated → they play A0.

Then: you both get 10

You get 10, which is **worse than 4**.

So if you delegate to M1, and Player 1 also delegates, you get 10 instead of 4 → you get **worse**.

So: **delegating to M1 when both delegate is bad for you**.

But what if you don’t delegate? Then you are free to play A1 → agree that you get 4.

So M1 is **dangerous** if both choose it.

But M1 also gives A1 when **only one delegates**, so you get A1.

But since you can get A1 anyway, you don't benefit.

The **risk is that both might choose M1**, and you get A0 → you lose.

So M1 gives you **more risk** when both delegate.

But you want to avoid that.

Now let’s check M2.

---

#### 🔹 M2 (Player 2’s mediator): Proposed by Player 2

- 1 delegate → A0
- 2 delegates → A1

So:
- If only one delegates → A0
- If two delegate → A1

Now, consider scenarios.

##### Case 1: You delegate to M2, other does not
- Only you delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0

Player 1 does not delegate → they choose their own action.

If they play A0 → you get 10
If they play A1 → you get 2

But if you play A0, Player 1 will rationally play A0 (10 > 2), so both get 10

So you get 10

But if you had not delegated, you could play A1 → then Player 1 would play A1 → you get 4

So now, if you delegate to M2 and are alone, you get **10**, which is **better than 4**

Wait — this is good!

So playing A0 by M2 is better than playing A1 for you **if Player 1 plays A0**

But will Player 1 play A0 if you are playing A0?

Yes — because if you play A0, Player 1 gets:
- 10 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → so they play A0

So if you delegate to M2 and you're alone, you're forced into A0 → Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10

But if you had played A1 yourself, you'd get 4

→ So **you get 10 > 4** → **better to delegate when alone to M2**

##### Case 2: Other player delegates to M2, you don’t
- Only other player delegates → M2 plays A0 → so Player 1 plays A0
- You play independently

You get:
- If you play A0: 10
- If you play A1: 20

So you will play A1 → get 20

So you get 20

Again, **better than if you had played A0 yourself**

Wait — this is even better.

So if you don’t delegate, and other delegates to M2, you get A0 from other player, so you get 20 by playing A1.

##### Case 3: Both delegate to M2
- Both delegate → M2 plays A1 → so you play A1
- Player 1 also plays A1

Then you get 4

But if neither delegated, both would play A1 (because A1 is dominant) → you still get 4

Same

So no difference.

But crucially: if **both delegate**, you get 4, same as without delegation.

Now, compare with **not delegating**:
- You play A1, Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4

Same

So delegation to M2 has:

- If you delegate, other doesn’t: you play A0 → get 10
- If other delegates, you don’t: you play A1 → get 20
- If both delegate: you play A1 → get 4
- If neither: you play A1 → get 4

So **you benefit in both asymmetric cases** (only you or only other delegate to M2), and same if both or neither.

So **M2 is beneficial or neutral for you** in every case.

In fact, **you are strictly better off when the delegation is unbalanced** — you get 10 or 20 instead of 4.

Even when both delegate, you get same as independent.

So **M2 is strictly better for you** in all cases, or at least not worse, and better in some.

Now compare M1:

- M1: 1 delegate → A1; 2 delegates → A0

If you delegate alone → you play A1 → you get 4 (since other plays A1)
If other delegates alone → you play A1 → you get 4
If both → you play A0 → you get 10
If neither → you play A1 → get 4

So in this case:
- If both delegate: you get 10 → better than 4
- If only one delegate: you get 4 → same as free play
- So M1 is **only better when both delegate**

But if both delegate to M1, you get 10 → good

But will both want to delegate?

Player 1’s incentives:

- M1: 1 delegate → A1; 2 delegates → A0
- If Player 1 delegates alone → they play A1 → opponent plays A1 → they get 4
- If opponent delegates alone → Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4
- If both → Player 1 plays A0 → they get 10 → good
- If neither → Player 1 plays A1 → gets 4

So **Player 1 benefits from both delegating** — 10 > 4

So Player 1 has **incentive to delegate if they think you will**

But you? You get 10 only if both delegate.

But you also get 4 if only one delegates.

So you get **10 if both delegate**, 4 otherwise

So your expected payoff depends on what happens.

But now, **you are deciding whether to approve the mediator**, and both mediators may be approved.

But the **winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve **both**, and Player 1 approves only M1, then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 2 → M2 wins.

Wait — you don’t control the other player’s approvals.

But you are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**, so you must consider that:

- The winning mediator depends on **approval counts**
- Both you and the other player approve mediators
- You don’t know what Player 1 will do.

But you can assume that **Player 1 is rational and self-interested**, and will approve **mediators that help them**.

So let’s model their incentives.

---

### **Step 5: Player 1 (other player) Approval Behavior**

Player 1 wants to maximize **their own payoff**.

Let’s analyze what **M1 and M2** do from **Player 1’s perspective**.

#### M1 (Player 1’s proposed mediator):
- 1 delegate → A1 (so Player 1 plays A1 if they delegate alone)
- 2 delegates → A0 (so both play A0)

So:
- If only Player 1 delegates → plays A1 → you play A1 (as Player 2) → Player 1 gets 0
- If only you delegate → M1 plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1 → gets 4
- If both → A0 → both get 10 → Player 1 gets 10
- If neither → Player 1 plays A1 → gets 4

So Player 1 gets:
- 0 (if only Player 1 delegates)
- 4 (if only you delegate)
- 10 (if both delegate)
- 4 (if neither)

So Player 1’s best outcome is **both delegate** (10), and **worst is only they delegate** (0).

So Player 1 will want to **induce the other player to delegate**, so that both end up delegating → they get 10.

But if both delegate, they are forced to A0 — which is better for them than playing A1 → 10 > 4

So Player 1 **wants to get you to delegate**, so they can both delegate and get 10.

Therefore, **Player 1 will approve M1**, because it gives them 10 if both delegate, and **if you delegate, they get 4**, which is better than 0.

But they **won’t benefit** if you don’t delegate and they do → they get 0 → bad.

So they want **you to delegate**.

Will they approve M2?

Let\'s check:\n\nPayoffs for **Player 1**:\n- If you play A0 → they get 10 (A0 vs A0), or 2 (A0 vs A1)\n- If you play A1 → they get 0 (A1 vs A0), or 4 (A1 vs A1)\n\nSo Player 1 prefers:\n- If you play A0: they prefer A0 (10 > 2)\n- If you play A1: they prefer A1 (4 > 0)\n\nSo if **you play A1**, Player 1 will choose A1 → you both get 4\n\nBut if you **delegate to M1**, and you are the only one, then M1 plays A1 → you play A1 → so Player 1 gets a payoff of 4 if they play A1, or 0 if A0 → so they will play A1\n\nThus, **if you delegate alone to M1**, you get A1, Player 1 plays A1 → you get **4 points**\n\nBut if you had **not delegated**, and played A1 yourself, then:\n- You play A1\n- Player 1 plays A1 → you still get **4**\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut if **you don\'t delegate**, and you play A1, and Player 1 plays A1, you get 4.\n\nSame as above.\n\nWait. But suppose **you don\'t delegate**, and you play A1.\n\nThen:\n- If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20\n- But Player 1 won’t play A0, because if you play A1, they get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → so **they prefer A1**\n\nSo they will play A1 → you get 4\n\nSo **if you choose A1 regardless**, you get 4.\n\nNow, if you delegate to M1 and you are alone → you still get A1 → same result\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut now, **if both delegate to M1**, M1 plays A0 → so you play A0.\n\nPlayer 1 also delegated → they play A0.\n\nThen: you both get 10\n\nYou get 10, which is **worse than 4**.\n\nSo if you delegate to M1, and Player 1 also delegates, you get 10 instead of 4 → you get **worse**.\n\nSo: **delegating to M1 when both delegate is bad for you**.\n\nBut what if you don’t delegate? Then you are free to play A1 → agree that you get 4.\n\nSo M1 is **dangerous** if both choose it.\n\nBut M1 also gives A1 when **only one delegates**, so you get A1.\n\nBut since you can get A1 anyway, you don\'t benefit.\n\nThe **risk is that both might choose M1**, and you get A0 → you lose.\n\nSo M1 gives you **more risk** when both delegate.\n\nBut you want to avoid that.\n\nNow let’s check M2.\n\n---\n\n#### 🔹 M2 (Player 2’s mediator): Proposed by Player 2\n\n- 1 delegate → A0\n- 2 delegates → A1\n\nSo:\n- If only one delegates → A0\n- If two delegate → A1\n\nNow, consider scenarios.\n\n##### Case 1: You delegate to M2, other does not\n- Only you delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0\n\nPlayer 1 does not delegate → they choose their own action.\n\nIf they play A0 → you get 10\nIf they play A1 → you get 2\n\nBut if you play A0, Player 1 will rationally play A0 (10 > 2), so both get 10\n\nSo you get 10\n\nBut if you had not delegated, you could play A1 → then Player 1 would play A1 → you get 4\n\nSo now, if you delegate to M2 and are alone, you get **10**, which is **better than 4**\n\nWait — this is good!\n\nSo playing A0 by M2 is better than playing A1 for you **if Player 1 plays A0**\n\nBut will Player 1 play A0 if you are playing A0?\n\nYes — because if you play A0, Player 1 gets:\n- 10 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → so they play A0\n\nSo if you delegate to M2 and you\'re alone, you\'re forced into A0 → Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10\n\nBut if you had played A1 yourself, you\'d get 4\n\n→ So **you get 10 > 4** → **better to delegate when alone to M2**\n\n##### Case 2: Other player delegates to M2, you don’t\n- Only other player delegates → M2 plays A0 → so Player 1 plays A0\n- You play independently\n\nYou get:\n- If you play A0: 10\n- If you play A1: 20\n\nSo you will play A1 → get 20\n\nSo you get 20\n\nAgain, **better than if you had played A0 yourself**\n\nWait — this is even better.\n\nSo if you don’t delegate, and other delegates to M2, you get A0 from other player, so you get 20 by playing A1.\n\n##### Case 3: Both delegate to M2\n- Both delegate → M2 plays A1 → so you play A1\n- Player 1 also plays A1\n\nThen you get 4\n\nBut if neither delegated, both would play A1 (because A1 is dominant) → you still get 4\n\nSame\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut crucially: if **both delegate**, you get 4, same as without delegation.\n\nNow, compare with **not delegating**:\n- You play A1, Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4\n\nSame\n\nSo delegation to M2 has:\n\n- If you delegate, other doesn’t: you play A0 → get 10\n- If other delegates, you don’t: you play A1 → get 20\n- If both delegate: you play A1 → get 4\n- If neither: you play A1 → get 4\n\nSo **you benefit in both asymmetric cases** (only you or only other delegate to M2), and same if both or neither.\n\nSo **M2 is beneficial or neutral for you** in every case.\n\nIn fact, **you are strictly better off when the delegation is unbalanced** — you get 10 or 20 instead of 4.\n\nEven when both delegate, you get same as independent.\n\nSo **M2 is strictly better for you** in all cases, or at least not worse, and better in some.\n\nNow compare M1:\n\n- M1: 1 delegate → A1; 2 delegates → A0\n\nIf you delegate alone → you play A1 → you get 4 (since other plays A1)\nIf other delegates alone → you play A1 → you get 4\nIf both → you play A0 → you get 10\nIf neither → you play A1 → get 4\n\nSo in this case:\n- If both delegate: you get 10 → better than 4\n- If only one delegate: you get 4 → same as free play\n- So M1 is **only better when both delegate**\n\nBut if both delegate to M1, you get 10 → good\n\nBut will both want to delegate?\n\nPlayer 1’s incentives:\n\n- M1: 1 delegate → A1; 2 delegates → A0\n- If Player 1 delegates alone → they play A1 → opponent plays A1 → they get 4\n- If opponent delegates alone → Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4\n- If both → Player 1 plays A0 → they get 10 → good\n- If neither → Player 1 plays A1 → gets 4\n\nSo **Player 1 benefits from both delegating** — 10 > 4\n\nSo Player 1 has **incentive to delegate if they think you will**\n\nBut you? You get 10 only if both delegate.\n\nBut you also get 4 if only one delegates.\n\nSo you get **10 if both delegate**, 4 otherwise\n\nSo your expected payoff depends on what happens.\n\nBut now, **you are deciding whether to approve the mediator**, and both mediators may be approved.\n\nBut the **winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.\n\nSo if you approve **both**, and Player 1 approves only M1, then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 2 → M2 wins.\n\nWait — you don’t control the other player’s approvals.\n\nBut you are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**, so you must consider that:\n\n- The winning mediator depends on **approval counts**\n- Both you and the other player approve mediators\n- You don’t know what Player 1 will do.\n\nBut you can assume that **Player 1 is rational and self-interested**, and will approve **mediators that help them**.\n\nSo let’s model their incentives.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Player 1 (other player) Approval Behavior**\n\nPlayer 1 wants to maximize **their own payoff**.\n\nLet’s analyze what **M1 and M2** do from **Player 1’s perspective**.\n\n#### M1 (Player 1’s proposed mediator):\n- 1 delegate → A1 (so Player 1 plays A1 if they delegate alone)\n- 2 delegates → A0 (so both play A0)\n\nSo:\n- If only Player 1 delegates → plays A1 → you play A1 (as Player 2) → Player 1 gets 0\n- If only you delegate → M1 plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1 → gets 4\n- If both → A0 → both get 10 → Player 1 gets 10\n- If neither → Player 1 plays A1 → gets 4\n\nSo Player 1 gets:\n- 0 (if only Player 1 delegates)\n- 4 (if only you delegate)\n- 10 (if both delegate)\n- 4 (if neither)\n\nSo Player 1’s best outcome is **both delegate** (10), and **worst is only they delegate** (0).\n\nSo Player 1 will want to **induce the other player to delegate**, so that both end up delegating → they get 10.\n\nBut if both delegate, they are forced to A0 — which is better for them than playing A1 → 10 > 4\n\nSo Player 1 **wants to get you to delegate**, so they can both delegate and get 10.\n\nTherefore, **Player 1 will approve M1**, because it gives them 10 if both delegate, and **if you delegate, they get 4**, which is better than 0.\n\nBut they **won’t benefit** if you don’t delegate and they do → they get 0 → bad.\n\nSo they want **you to delegate**.\n\nWill they approve M2?\n\n'

response:
First, let's analyze each action's possible outcomes to maximize our points:

### Without Mediator:
1. **If I choose A0:**
    - If Player 2 chooses A0:
        - I get 10 points, Player 2 gets 10 points.
    - If Player 2 chooses A1:
        - I get 0 points, Player 2 gets 20 points.

2. **If I choose A1:**
    - If Player 2 chooses A0:
        - I get 6 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
    - If Player 2 chooses A1:
        - I get 4 points, Player 2 gets 4 points.

### With Mediator:
- If only I delegate (Player 1 delegates):
    - Mediator plays A0 for me regardless of what Player 2 does.
- If both players delegate:
    - Mediator plays A1 for both of us, resulting in each getting 4 points.

### Strategy Breakdown:
- **Action "A0"** offers high rewards when both players cooperate but risks getting zero if the other player aims for individual maximization by choosing A1.
- **Action "A1"** offers better-than-worst outcomes regardless of the other player's decision, thus ensuring a safer medium reward.
- **Action "A2" (Delegate to Mediator)** provides a structured approach:
    - If only I delegate, I know I'll get the payoff of A0 against whatever Player 2 chooses.
    - If both delegate, it ensures cooperation leading to mutual payoff, which may be slightly beneficial if a sub-optimal collaborative outcome is better than individual risk.

### Probability Distribution Consideration:
Considering the payoff variations and mediatory involvement, an effective strategy can balance risk-taking (individual high score) and safety (ensured mutualistic payout through mediation).

**Risk-Reward Analysis**:
To decide the probability distribution:
- A higher value on A1 mitigates the risk of Player 2’s random choice.
- Some value on A2 (delicate self-mediation) could lean towards cooperative assurance.

Based on this, my action probabilities should ensure:
1. A safer bet on individual action A1.
2. A moderate consideration for cooperative mediation through A2.
3. A minimal but potential high-risk/high-reward option on A0.

### Final Strategy:
- A moderate priority on A1 for ensured medium points.
- Significant, but prudent delegation to A2 in leaning towards structured cooperative outcomes.
- Minimal, but contingent risk assignment to A0 for potential higher reward.

Thus, considering all aspects:

```json
{
  "A0": 20,
  "A1": 50,
  "A2": 30
}
```

This distribution attempts balance; a fail-safe collaboration route via A2 combined with practical risk through A1 and intent allowance on A0 uncertainty.

response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure

The basic payoff matrix (My points, Other's points):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)  
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

## Step 2: Understand the Mediator

- If only 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- If both players delegate → mediator plays A0

## Step 3: Calculate My Expected Payoffs

Let q0, q1, q2 be the opponent's probabilities for A0, A1, A2.

**If I play A0:**
- Expected payoff = 10·q0 + 0·q1 + 0·q2 = 10·q0

**If I play A1:**
- Expected payoff = 6·q0 + 4·q1 + 4·q2 = 4 + 2·q0

**If I delegate (A2):**
- vs opponent's A0: Only I delegate → mediator plays A1 for me → (A1, A0) → I get 6
- vs opponent's A1: Only I delegate → mediator plays A1 for me → (A1, A1) → I get 4
- vs opponent's A2: Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get 10
- Expected payoff = 6·q0 + 4·q1 + 10·q2 = 4 + 2·q0 + 6·q2

**Key observation:** E[A2] - E[A1] = 6·q2 ≥ 0

So A2 is always at least as good as A1, and strictly better whenever opponent might delegate.

## Step 4: Analyze Opponent's Incentives

From opponent's perspective (by symmetry of analysis):
- Playing A1 strictly dominates A0 (opponent gets 2+8·p0 from A0 vs 4+16·p0 from A1)
- Playing A2 gives 4+16·p0+6·p2, which beats A1 whenever I might delegate

## Step 5: Find Nash Equilibrium

Consider both players delegating (A2, A2):
- Both delegate → outcome is (A0, A0) → both get 10

**Checking for profitable deviations:**
- If I deviate to A0 while opponent delegates: (A0, A1) → I get 0 < 10 ✗
- If I deviate to A1 while opponent delegates: (A1, A1) → I get 4 < 10 ✗
- Same analysis for opponent by symmetry

This is a strict Nash equilibrium with the highest mutual payoff (10, 10).

## Step 6: Consider Alternative Equilibria

(A1, A1) is also an equilibrium giving (4, 4), but:
- It's Pareto-dominated by (A2, A2)
- Players are only weakly committed (indifferent to deviating to A2)
- The mediator was designed precisely to achieve coordination on (A0, A0) = (10, 10)

## Conclusion

The rational choice is to delegate with certainty, achieving the cooperative outcome of 10 points through the mediator mechanism.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are Player 1. The payoff matrix is:

|          | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **You A0** | 10, 10          | 0, 20           |
| **You A1** | 6, 2            | 4, 4            |

We are to **maximize our own points**.

Let’s analyze best responses:

- If the other player plays A0:
  - You get 10 (if A0) vs 6 (if A1) → prefer A0
- If the other player plays A1:
  - You get 0 (if A0) vs 4 (if A1) → prefer A1

So, no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Let’s find the mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability you play A0
- $ q $ = probability other player plays A0

**Your expected payoff:**

$$
EU_1 = p q \cdot 10 + p (1 - q) \cdot 0 + (1 - p) q \cdot 6 + (1 - p)(1 - q) \cdot 4
$$

Simplify:
$$
EU_1 = 10pq + 0 + 6q(1 - p) + 4(1 - p)(1 - q)
$$
$$
= 10pq + 6q - 6pq + 4(1 - p - q + pq)
$$
$$
= (10pq - 6pq) + 6q + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq
$$
$$
= 4pq + 2q + 4 - 4p
$$

To find best response, take derivative w.r.t. $ p $, set to 0:

$$
\frac{dEU_1}{dp} = 4q - 4 = 0 \Rightarrow q = 1
$$

Wait — that suggests your best response depends on $ q $. Let’s instead find the value of $ q $ that makes **you indifferent** between A0 and A1.

Let’s compute expected utility of A0 and A1, given $ q $:

- $ EU(A0) = 10q + 0(1 - q) = 10q $
- $ EU(A1) = 6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

Set equal for indifference:
$$
10q = 2q + 4 \Rightarrow 8q = 4 \Rightarrow q = 0.5
$$

So if the other player plays A0 with 0.5, you are indifferent.

Similarly, from the other player’s perspective (Player 2), we can find their indifference point.

Player 2’s incentives:

- $ EU_2(A0): 10p + 2(1 - p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $
- $ EU_2(A1): 20p + 4(1 - p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4 $

Set equal:
$$
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 \Rightarrow -8p = 2 \Rightarrow p = -0.25
$$

Invalid — means no solution in [0,1]. So Player 2 always prefers A1 when $ p < 1 $, and is indifferent only at extreme.

Wait — this suggests **Player 2 has a dominant strategy**?

Check:

For Player 2:
- If you play A0 (p = 1): 
  - A0: 10, A1: 20 → prefers A1
- If you play A1 (p = 0):
  - A0: 2, A1: 4 → prefers A1

So **Player 2 always prefers A1**, regardless of your action.

**So Player 2 has a dominant strategy: play A1.**

Therefore, in any equilibrium, Player 2 will play A1.

Then, your best response:
- If other plays A1 → you get 0 (if A0), 4 (if A1) → best to play A1

So **(A1, A1)** is the Nash equilibrium, giving you 4 points.

But is there a better outcome?

Wait — if you play A0 and they play A0, you get 10 — better!

But they won’t. They have dominant strategy A1.

So unless we can change their behavior, we’re stuck with (A1, A1) → 4 points.

But now comes the **delegation twist**.

---

### **Step 2: Delegation and Mediator System**

You have two choices:
- Act independently
- Delegate to a mediator

But first, we must **approve** mediators via **approval voting**.

The proposed mediators:
- **M1**: proposed by Player 1
- **M2**: proposed by Player 2

Their behavior:
> M1:  
> - If 1 player delegates → play A1  
> - If 2 players delegate → play A0  

> M2:  
> - If 1 player delegates → play A1  
> - If 2 players delegate → play A0  

**So M1 and M2 are identical in behavior.**

Both do:
- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

So they are functionally the same.

Now, **you are to approve mediators** via approval voting.

The winning mediator is the one with **maximum number of approvals**, and if there is a tie, it's selected **uniformly at random**.

Your goal: **maximize your expected points.**

So you must choose which mediators to approve **to maximize your expected payoff**, knowing that:
- You can delegate (or not), but delegation is a later step (not needed yet).
- The mediator only comes into play **if someone delegates**, and **only if it's selected**.
- The mediator’s behavior depends on **how many players delegate to it**.

But **first**, we decide **which mediators to approve**.

Important: You are **Player 1**, and you are to approve **M1** and **M2**.

Since M1 and M2 are **identical in behavior**, **your only reason to prefer one over the other is strategic** — to maximize the chance that a good mediator is selected.

But since they behave identically, approving one or the other has **no impact on the outcome**, unless the number of approvals affects the chance that *any* mediator is selected.

But here's the catch: **the winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals.**

So if:
- You approve both M1 and M2 → both have 1 approval (so tie) → winner is random → 50% chance M1, 50% M2 → but both act same → outcome same
- If you approve only M1 → M1 has 1, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → mediator acts as A1 if 1 delegate, A0 if 2 delegates
- If you approve only M2 → same as above, M2 wins → same behavior

So whether you approve M1 or M2 or both, the **actual behavior of the winning mediator is identical in all cases**, and depends only on **how many players delegate**.

But you’re supposed to **maximize your expected points**, so you want to **make sure that a mediator with desirable behavior is selected** — but here, **both have same behavior**.

So you might think: "No difference, so just approve both."

Wait — **but your approval can influence the outcome of the selection process.**

But since both mediators behave the same, **the outcome is identical regardless of which one is selected.**

So from your perspective, **M1 and M2 are equivalent**.

Therefore, **any approval set leads to same expected payoffs.**

But we must choose **which ones to approve**.

Now, here’s a subtle point: **the other player also approves mediators.**

We don’t know their preferences.

So we need to think: **Would a strategic player approve only one or both?**

But the question is not asking us to predict the other player’s vote — it’s asking **you**, as Player 1, to **decide which mediators to approve**, with the goal of maximizing your **expected points**.

But since both mediators are identical, **your vote has no effect on their behavior**.

So approving both vs. approving one — the **resulting mediator behavior is identical** in function.

But wait — here’s a strategic consideration: by approving **both**, you **increase the chance that the mediator is selected**.

Because:
- If you approve **only one**, say M1 → and other player approves M2 → then M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → tie → winner is chosen uniformly → so 50% chance M1, 50% M2 → but both behave same → outcome same
- If you approve both, and other player approves only one → then both M1 and M2 still have 1 approval each → tie → again random selection → same outcome

In **all cases**, since both mediators behave identically, the outcome depends **only on how many players delegate to the mediator (i.e., to the selected one)**.

So the key is: **How many players delegate to the mediator?**

But the **number of delegators** depends on players’ choices, **after** the mediator is selected.

But importantly: **The mediator only plays when at least one player delegates to it.**

And the outcome depends on whether 1 or 2 players delegate.

But you must decide your **approval** **before** delegation decisions.

So your approval affects **who** can be the winning mediator, but **since both M1 and M2 behave identically**, the **behavior is determined solely by how many players delegate — not by which mediator is selected**.

Therefore, **your approval decision does not affect the outcome**, as long as **at least one mediator is approved**.

But if you approve **neither**, then **no mediator is selected** (since maximum approvals = 0), so **no delegation is possible**.

That would force both of you to play independently.

But if you approve at least one, then a mediator is selected (if at least one has max approvals), and then you can delegate.

So we need to ask: **What is your expected payoff in each scenario?**

Let’s compare:

---

### **Option 1: Approve neither M1 nor M2**

Then no mediator is selected → **no delegation possible** → both players must play independently.

Then, as we analyzed: Player 2 has dominant strategy A1 → so他们会 play A1.

Then you, to maximize your payoff, will play A1 (since 4 > 0), so you get **4 points**.

So in this case, **your expected payoff = 4**.

---

### **Option 2: Approve only M1**

Then M1 is approved, M2 is not.

Now, the other player can approve M1 or M2 or both.

Let’s suppose they approve M1 → then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.

If they approve M2 → M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → tie → random selection → M1 or M2 → but both behave same → so outcome same.

So in **all cases**, a mediator with behavior “1 delegate → A1, 2 delegates → A0” will be selected.

So now, what happens depends on **how many players delegate**.

But **you** and **the other player** can decide whether to delegate or not.

Now, **if you delegate**, the mediator plays based on **how many delegate**.

So let’s suppose that **you are considering whether to delegate**.

But the decision to delegate is **after** the mediator is chosen.

But now **you must decide: should you approve both or not?**

The key insight: **approval affects whether a mediator exists, but not its behavior.**

But since both mediators behave the same, the **only difference** between approving both vs. one is **in the selection process, the chance that a mediator is chosen**.

But actually — as long as at least one is approved, a mediator is selected (since the max approvals is at least 1).

In the case you approve only M1:
- If other player approves M1 → M1 wins
- If other player approves M2 → both M1 and M2 approved → max approvals = 1 → tie → one selected at random → so 50% chance M1 wins, 50% M2 → but both same → OK

So in **all cases**, a mediator will be selected (since at least one approval).

Same if you approve both: still at least one mediator selected.

So the only case where **no mediator is selected** is if **no one approves any**.

But since you are **Player 1**, if you approve **at least one**, then **at least one mediator is approved**, so **a mediator will be selected** (because max approvals ≥ 1).

Therefore, **approving at least one mediator ensures that delegation is possible**.

But **approving both does not make the behavior better — it’s the same**.

So why approve both?

Because you want to **maximize the chance that a mediator exists**, but if you approve at least one, and others may approve, it's **guaranteed** that a mediator exists.

But if you **don't approve any**, no mediator exists → you’re back to 4 points.

So **approving at least one is better** than approving none.

But now, does **approving both** give you an advantage over approving only one?

Suppose the other player is **rational and wants to maximize their points**.

They might prefer a mediator that helps them.

But again, both mediators behave identically.

But **here's a twist**: **mediator behavior depends on how many delegate**.

Suppose both players **delegate** to the mediator.

Then the mediator plays A0.

So if you are Player 1 and you delegate (and the other does too), the outcome is: **you play A0**, other plays A0 → you get **10 points**.

That’s way better than 4.

But the **other player** would get 10 too — which is also better for them.

So if both can **coordinate on delegating**, they both get 10.

But is that incentive compatible?

Wait — **both players** get 10 if both delegate → so **both benefit equally**.

But the **mediator only plays A0 if 2 delegates**.

So if **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → both get 10.

If only one delegates, mediator plays A1 → so that player gets A1.

Let’s suppose both players **can** delegate or not.

But you are **choosing** whether to approve the mediator.

Assume that **a mediator is selected** (so you approve at least one).

Then, the players can choose to delegate or not.

Let’s suppose **you decide to delegate**.

Then:
- If only you delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get A1 → you get **4 points** (since other player may play whatever)
- But wait — if you delegate, mediator plays A1, so you play A1.

But if the other player plays A0, you get 4.

If the other player plays A1, you get 4.

But you **get 4** regardless.

But if **both delegate**, then 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → both get 10.

So **if both delegate, you both get 10**.

But **if only one delegates**, that one gets 4 (from A1), and the other gets whatever they play.

So **each player** gets **10 if both delegate**, **4 if only you delegate**, and **unknown if neither delegates**.

But if **neither delegates**, you must play independently.

Then, as before, **Player 2 plays A1** (dominant), and you play A1 (best response) → you get 4.

So in all cases where **only one delegates or neither**, you get **≤4**.

But if **both delegate**, you get 10.

So **you want both to delegate**.

But can you **commit** to delegate?

Yes — if the mediator is in place, **you can choose to delegate**.

But the other player must also choose to delegate.

But **both benefit equally** from both delegating → both get 10.

So **if both players can coordinate**, they will both delegate.

But is this a **Nash equilibrium**?

Suppose you believe the other player will delegate.

Then you prefer to delegate too → because 10 > 4.

If you believe they won't delegate, then:
- If you delegate → you get 4
- If you don’t → you play independently → get 4 (since other plays A1)

So you are indifferent between delegating and not.

But **if both believe the other will delegate**, then both will.

So **(both delegate) is a Nash equilibrium**.

Also, (neither delegate) is also an equilibrium: if both expect the other not to delegate, they don’t.

But in that case, you get 4.

But **10 > 4**, so **both prefer the coordinated delegation outcome**.

So it’s a **coordination game**.

Now, your **approval** of mediators affects whether this **coordination is possible**.

But as long as you approve **at least one**, a mediator exists → delegation is possible → **coordination to both delegate is possible** → then you can both get 10.

But if you **approve neither**, then **no mediation** → you must play independently → you get 4.

So **you prefer to approve at least one**.

But since **both mediators behave identically**, it doesn’t matter which one you approve.

But now: **what if the other player approves only one?**

Suppose you approve only M1.

- Other player approves M2 → then both M1 and M2 are approved → max approvals = 1 → tie → winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% M1, 50% M2 → but both same → behavior same.

So no problem.

If you approve M1 only, and other approves M1 → M1 wins → same.

So **your approval of one is fine**.

But now, suppose that by approving **both**, you **increase the chance that the mediator is selected**?

Wait — in all cases where you approve at least one, **a mediator is selected**.

Only if **no mediator is approved at all**, no mediator is selected.

So **by approving at least one**, you **guarantee that a mediator is selected**, regardless of others.

But if you approve **only one**, and the other player approves **none**, then M1 has 1, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → mediator exists.

Only if **you approve neither**, and **other approves neither**, then **no mediator**.

So you **must** approve at least one to **ensure** mediation is possible.

But **approving both doesn't make it more likely** — it’s already guaranteed if you approve at least one.

So there's **no downside** to approving both — it doesn’t hurt.

But **is there a reason to approve only one**?

Suppose the other player is trying to **prevent** coordination.

But since both mediators are identical, **it doesn’t matter**.

But now — **here's a key point**: the **mediator is only chosen if at least one is approved**.

But if you **don’t** approve any, no mediator.

So **your best strategy is to approve at least one**.

Now, consider: if you approve only M1, and the other player approves M2, then both are approved, so mediator is selected.

Same if you approve both.

So **either way**, if you approve at least one, and the other may approve nothing, or one, or both, **a mediator is selected**.

So **no difference** between approving one or both in terms of **whether mediation is possible**.

But now — **what if the other player wants to block mediation**?

Suppose they want no delegation (because they expect you to be selfish and not cooperate).

But **they don’t know your strategy**.

From your perspective: **both choices (approving one or both) lead to same chance of mediation**, and same behavior.

But approving **both** is **safe** — it doesn't hurt.

But is there any **risk** in approving both?

Only if **you want to avoid coordination**, but you **want to get 10**, so you **want coordination to happen**.

So you **do not want to prevent** mediation.

Therefore, **you want to approve at least one**.

But between approving one or both — **both are equally good**, since both lead to same expected payoff.

But to **maximize your chance of coordination**, you want to **avoid any possibility of no mediator**.

But if you approve at least one, you are safe.

So approving **both** is **not worse**, and might be **better** if others approve differently.

Wait — actually, **approving both ensures that even if the other player approves only one**, you still have both approved, so **if there’s a tie, it’s resolved randomly**, but behavior same.

So **no harm**.

Moreover, **if the other player approves a mediator**, you are fine.

But is there a **reason to not approve M2**?

Only if you think it might be worse — but it’s **identical**.

So **you should approve both**.

But here’s an idea: **what if the other player also approves only one?**

Suppose you approve **only M1**, and they approve **only M2**.

Then both have 1 approval → tie → random selection → 50% M1, 50% M2 → but both same → outcome same.

If you approve **both**, and they approve **only M2**, then M1 and M2 both have 1 → tie → same.

So **no difference**.

Therefore, the **number of approvals doesn’t change the outcome**, as long as **at least one is approved**.

So **you can approve either**, but since both are equal and you want mediation to be possible, and you want to **avoid any scenario where no mediator exists**, you should **approve at least one**.

But is there any **cost** to approving both?

No. So **you should approve both**.

Moreover, by approving both, you **cannot be the cause of no mediator being selected** — even if the other player approves nothing, you still approve one.

So you **guarantee** that mediation can happen.

Whereas if you approve only one, and the other player approves nothing, still mediation happens (that's fine).

But if you approve both, you are **even safer** in case others are indifferent.

But actually, **in all cases with at least one approval, mediator exists**.

So both options are **sufficient**.

But to **maximize expected payoff**, you must **enable coordination**.

The key is: **can both players delegate?**

Yes, if a mediator exists.

So **as long as you approve at least one**, mediation is possible → and coordination to both delegate can occur → you get 10.

But if you **approve neither**, you get 4.

So your **expected payoff is 10 if you approve at least one**, and **4 if you approve none**.

Therefore, **you must approve at least one**.

But which one(s)?

Since both are identical, **approve both** — it doesn’t hurt, and it’s safe.

Moreover, **approving both increases the number of approvals**, but since ties are resolved randomly, and behavior is same, **it doesn’t change outcome**.

But **approval voting**: by approving both, you **increase your vote share**, but since it's only about maximum approval, and both are same, it doesn’t help.

But **if you approve both**, and the other player approves one, then the maximum is 2 (if they approve both, it’s 3), but if they approve only one, and you approve both, then max is 2, and if only one of the two has 2 approvals, then only that one wins — but both are **M1 and M2**, both are identical.

Wait — no.

Suppose:
- You approve M1 and M2
- Other player approves only M2
Then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 2 approvals
→ M2 has max → M2 wins
→ mediator behavior: 1 delegate → A1, 2 delegates → A0 → same as before.

If you approve only M1, other approves M2 → both have 1 → tie → random winner → same behavior.

So **same outcome**.

Therefore, **no difference**.

But **by approving both**, you **guarantee that even if the other player approves only one**, the mediator is selected (and M2 wins), but same behavior.

So **no benefit**.

But now — what if the other player approves **nothing**?
- You approve both → M1: 1, M2: 1 → max = 1 → tie → random winner → but both same → mediator selected → good.

- If you approve only one → same.

So **no difference**.

The **only difference** is that by approving both, you **cannot be blamed for no mediator** — but you are still fine.

Therefore, since there is **no disadvantage** to approving both, and **no benefit to approving only one**, **why not approve both?**

Moreover, if you **approve only one**, and the other player **also approves only one**, and they are different (M1 and M2), then tie → random → but same behavior.

So overall, **approving both is safe and equivalent**.

But is there a **reason not to approve a mediator**?

Only if you think it might lead to worse outcome — but both are identical.

Therefore, **you should approve both**.

But wait — the **mediator is selected only if it has maximum approvals**, but if you approve both, and other approves nothing, then both have 1 → tie → random → same.

But if you approve **only M1**, and other approves only M2, same.

So **no difference**.

But here’s a **key insight**: **the mediator behavior is identical**, so **the approval decision is purely strategic to ensure that delegation is possible**.

But you **want delegation to be possible** → so you **must approve at least one**.

Since approving both doesn’t hurt and doesn’t change behavior, you **should approve both**.

Therefore, **your answer: approve both M1 and M2**.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To maximize the total points received, let's first analyze the independent game (without a mediator) and then consider the role of the mediators.

### 1. Game Analysis (Independent Play)
The payoff matrix based on the instructions is:
- **(P1: A0, P2: A0):** P1 = 10, P2 = 10
- **(P1: A0, P2: A1):** P1 = 0,   P2 = 20
- **(P1: A1, P2: A0):** P1 = 6,   P2 = 2
- **(P1: A1, P2: A1):** P1 = 4,   P2 = 4

**Player 2's Strategy:** 
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) or 20 (A1). A1 is better.
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 (A0) or 4 (A1). A1 is better.
Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play **A1**.

**Player 1's Strategy:**
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 (A0) or 4 (A1). A1 is better.
Player 1 will respond to P2's dominant A1 by playing **A1**.

The Nash Equilibrium for independent play is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Mediator Analysis
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **1 Player delegates:** The mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- **2 Players delegate:** The mediator plays **A0** for both players.

If both players delegate (D, D), the mediator forces the outcome **(A0, A0)**, which yields **10 points** for each player.

**Is delegation stable?**
- If Player 1 delegates, Player 2 can either delegate (D) or play independently (ND).
    - If Player 2 delegates (D), the outcome is (A0, A0) = **10 points**.
    - If Player 2 does not delegate (ND), the mediator plays A1 for Player 1. P2 will respond with A1, leading to (A1, A1) = **4 points**.
- Thus, if one player delegates, the other player's best interest is also to delegate.

Delegation allows both players to move from the Nash Equilibrium of (4, 4) to the Pareto optimal outcome of (10, 10).

### 3. Conclusion
Both mediators M1 and M2 provide a mechanism for the players to coordinate on the (A0, A0) outcome while protecting against exploitation by defaulting to action A1 if only one party commits. Since both mediators are identical and offer a higher potential payoff than independent play, Player 2 should approve both.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

In the base game without a mediator, Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1 (they get 20 vs 10 if I play A0, and 4 vs 2 if I play A1). Given they play A1, my best response is A1. So the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) → both get 4 points.

## Step 2: Analyze Mediator 1 (M1)

M1: If 1 delegates → A1; If 2 delegate → A0

Delegation game outcomes:
- Both delegate: M1 plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get **10**
- I delegate, they don't: I get A1, they best-respond with A1 → I get 4
- I don't, they delegate: They get A1, I best-respond with A1 → I get 4  
- Neither delegates: Base game → I get 4

Strategy analysis:
- If other delegates: I should delegate (10 > 4)
- If other doesn't: Indifferent (both give 4)

**Equilibrium: Both delegate → I get 10**

## Step 3: Analyze Mediator 2 (M2)

M2: If 1 delegates → A0; If 2 delegate → A1

Delegation game outcomes:
- Both delegate: M1 plays A1 for both → (A1, A1) → I get 4
- I delegate, they don't: I get A0, they best-respond with A1 → I get 0
- I don't, they delegate: They get A0, I best-respond with A0 → I get **10**
- Neither delegates: Base game → I get 4

Strategy analysis:
- If other delegates: Don't delegate (10 > 4)
- If other doesn't: Don't delegate (4 > 0)

**"Don't delegate" is dominant for me. Equilibrium: I don't delegate, they delegate → I get 10**

## Step 4: Compare mediators

Both mediators achieve the same equilibrium outcome for me: **10 points** (compared to 4 in the base game).

- M1: Requires mutual delegation, but coordination is straightforward since both delegating is mutually beneficial
- M2: Gives me a dominant strategy (don't delegate), and the other player benefits from delegating given my rational play

Both mediators improve upon the base game and lead to the cooperative outcome. There's no strategic reason to reject either one.

response:
Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)**

We are Player 1 in a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 (Other) | A1 (Other) |
|-----------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                      | 10, 10     | 0, 20      |
| **A1**                      | 6, 2        | 4, 4       |

We want to **maximize our own points**.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria in this base game.

---

### **Step 2: Find best responses and Nash equilibria**

Let’s denote:
- Your probability of choosing A0: `p`
- Other player's probability of choosing A0: `q`

Expected payoff for you if you play A0:
- `10*q + 0*(1-q) = 10q`

Expected payoff if you play A1:
- `6*q + 4*(1-q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4`

You are indifferent when:
- `10q = 2q + 4` → `8q = 4` → `q = 0.5`

So your best response:
- If `q < 0.5`, play A0 (since 10q > 2q+4)
- If `q > 0.5`, play A1 (since 2q+4 > 10q)
- If `q = 0.5`, indifferent

Now for the other player:

Their payoff from:
- A0: `10*p + 20*(1-p) = 10p + 20 - 20p = 20 - 10p`
- A1: `2*p + 4*(1-p) = 2p + 4 - 4p = 4 - 2p`

Set equal:
- `20 - 10p = 4 - 2p` → `16 = 8p` → `p = 2`

Wait — that can’t be! `p = 2` is impossible.

Wait: solve again:
- `20 - 10p = 4 - 2p`
- `20 - 4 = 10p - 2p`
- `16 = 8p` → `p = 2`? That’s not possible.

Wait — this implies no interior solution. Let’s recheck.

Other player’s payoff from:
- A0: if you play A0: 10, if you play A1: 2 → expected: `10p + 2(1-p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2`
- A1: if you play A0: 20, if you play A1: 4 → expected: `20p + 4(1-p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4`

Set equal: `8p + 2 = 16p + 4` → `2 - 4 = 8p` → `-2 = 8p` → `p = -0.25` → not valid

So:
- If `p < -0.25` → A0 better? But p ≥ 0
- For all p in [0,1], compare `8p+2` vs `16p+4`:
  - `16p+4 - (8p+2) = 8p + 2 > 0` for all p ≥ 0 → A1 always strictly better

So **for the other player, A1 is strictly dominant**! They always prefer A1 regardless of your action.

Thus, in the base game, the other player will play A1 (if unilaterally rational).

Given that, your best response is:
- If other plays A1:
  - A0: 0 points
  - A1: 4 points
  → So best to play A1.

**Thus, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)** → you get 4 points.

But wait — is that really the only equilibrium?

Wait — suppose both players play A1 → you get 4, other gets 4.

But if you deviate to A0 → you get 0 → worse.

Other player: if you play A1, they get 2 (if they play A0) or 4 (if they play A1). So A1 is better.

So yes, (A1, A1) is the only Nash equilibrium.

So **in the base game, you get 4 points** if both play rationally.

However, the key insight is: we now have **mediators** and **approval voting** to decide which mediator is used.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the mediator mechanism**

- You and the other player each **approve or disapprove** mediators.
- The mediator with the **maximum number of approvals** wins.
- If multiple have max approvals, one is chosen **uniformly at random**.
- Then, **you may delegate** your choice to the selected mediator.

Important: You can choose **either to delegate to the mediator (if selected)** or **act independently**.

But first: the **approvals** phase — you must approve **some** or **all** mediators.

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate the two mediators**

Both are proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 — **but the wording says**:

> Mediator proposed by Player 1:  
> • If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.  
> • If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

> Mediator proposed by Player 2:  
> • If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.  
> • If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Wait — both are **identical** in behavior!

So both mediators:
- If only one player delegates → play A1
- If both players delegate → play A0

So **M1 and M2 are behaviorally identical**.

Thus, **from a gameplay perspective, they are indistinguishable**.

Now, the question is: which ones should you **approve**?

You want to **maximize your total points**, over the final outcome.

But the **selection of the mediator** depends on **both players’ approvals**, and the **final decision** (delegate or not) happens **after**.

Let’s clarify the **full sequence**:

1. You and the other player **simultaneously approve** mediators.
   - You decide: approve M1? M2?
2. The mediator(s) with **maximum approvals** are candidates.
3. One is selected **uniformly at random** from those with max approvals.
4. Then, both players **choose** whether to **delegate** to the mediator or act independently.
   - You decide: delegate or not?
   - Other player (possibly) decides: delegate or not?

But wait — the problem says:

> "If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you..."

So **you decide whether to delegate or not**, based on who was selected.

But the other player? Does *they* get to decide?

Problem says: *"you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present..."*

Then: *"you can also choose to act independently."*

It doesn't specify whether the other player can delegate or not.

But let’s assume: **both players can choose to delegate or not**, after the mediator is selected.

This is reasonable — the mediator is available, but each player decides whether to use it.

So, final sequence:

1. You and the other player **approve** mediators (simultaneously).
2. The **winner** is selected uniformly at random from those with **max approvals**.
3. Then, each player independently decides: **delegate** or **act independently**.
4. The mediator applies its rule based on **how many players delegated to it**.
5. Payoffs are determined.

Important: The **mediator’s action depends on how many players delegated to it**, not on who they are.

So, let’s denote:

- Let M be the selected mediator (M1 or M2, both same behavior).
- Let k = number of players who **choose to delegate** to M (k ∈ {0,1,2})

Then:
- If k = 1: mediator plays A1
- If k = 2: mediator plays A0

But if a player chooses to **act independently**, their action is not determined by the mediator.

So now, we have to think strategically: **what should you approve**, and **what will you do in the delegation phase**, given all that.

---

### **Step 5: Strategy for the approval phase**

Since both mediators behave identically, **their approval outcomes are symmetric**.

But the **other player** may have different preferences.

You are **Player 1**, who wants to **maximize their own score**.

Let’s analyze **possible outcomes** depending on mediator selection and delegation.

But first: the **approval vote** is **simultaneous** and **you** must decide which mediators to approve.

Suppose you approve **both** M1 and M2.

Then:
- If other player approves only M1 → M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.
- If other approves only M2 → M2 wins.
- If other approves both → both have 2 → winner chosen at random.

So if you approve both, **you guarantee that the selected mediator is one of them** — no matter what.

Suppose you approve **only one**, say M1.
Then:
- If other approves only M2 → neither mediator is approved by both → no mediator wins? Or is there always a winner?

Problem says: "the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if there is **a tie** for max approvals, one is picked at random.

But if **only one mediator has the max**, it wins.

But if **all mediators are disapproved**, then no mediator has approvals → no one wins?

But the problem doesn’t specify what happens in that case.

But we are told: "you will have the option to delegate" — so **there will be a mediator**? Or not?

Let me re-read:

> "You can also choose to act independently."

So delegation is **an option**, so a mediator must exist.

So probably, **at least one mediator must be approved**.

But to be safe — let's suppose the game **requires** a mediator to be chosen.

But to maximize your control, you want **a mediator to be selected** with high probability.

So you should **approve at least one**.

But if you approve **only one**, and the other player does **not** approve it, then that mediator has 1 approval (yours), the other has 0 → chosen.

So M1 (only one approved) → wins.

So even if the other player disapproves, if you approve one and they disapprove all others, your approved one wins.

But if you **approve only M1**, and **the other player approves only M2**, then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 1 approval → tie → random selection → both have 50% chance.

But now, both mediators are identical — so it doesn't matter.

So for **your own expected score**, it’s the same whether M1 or M2 is selected.

Thus, from your perspective, **it doesn't matter which one is selected** — they are **identical**.

So your **only concern** is:
- What is the **probability** that a mediator is selected?
- What is the **optimal delegation strategy** in the subsequent phase?

But if you **approve a mediator**, it increases the chance it is selected — unless others disapprove.

But since the other player may disapprove, you need to think about **what the other player is likely to do**.

But you **don’t know** their strategy. You have to assume rational behavior.

So let’s model this strategically.

---

### **Step 6: What should you do in the delegation phase?**

After a mediator is selected, **each player decides** whether to delegate or not.

Let’s denote:

- You choose: delegate or not
- Other player chooses: delegate or not
- Then the mediator acts based on how many **delegated to it**.

But note: **you can only delegate to the selected mediator** — that's the one that was chosen.

So if M1 is selected, you can delegate to M1 or not.

The other player can delegate to M1 or not.

So the mediator will then:
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

If no one delegates, then the mediator **does not act**, so you both play independently.

Wait — but the mediator only acts **if someone delegates**?

No — the rule is: *"the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it."*

So the **action is determined by the number who delegated** — **regardless of whether you delegate**, if you don’t delegate, your action is not set by the mediator.

So:

- If you delegate: your action is set by mediator.
- If not: you choose your own action.

Similarly for other player.

But the **mediator's action** depends only on **how many** delegated to it.

So the **actions taken** are:
- Delegators: follow mediator's rule (A1 if 1 delegate, A0 if 2)
- Non-delegators: choose their own actions.

Now, **you want to maximize your score**.

So, **after mediator is selected**, you will choose whether to delegate **based on**:
- Your beliefs about the other player’s choice
- The structure of the game
- The mediator’s rule

But we don’t know the other player’s strategy — but we **can assume they are rational**, so they will try to maximize their own score.

So let’s suppose you pick **one mediator** to be selected — say M.

Then, in the delegation phase, you and the other player choose independently whether to delegate.

Let’s analyze the **best responses**.

---

### **Step 7: Delegation phase analysis (for a fixed mediator M)**

Remember: M has rule:
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So the mediator’s action is:
- A1 if exactly one of you delegates
- A0 if both delegate
- If no one delegates: no action from mediator? Then you both act independently.

Wait — if no one delegates, then the "how many delegated" is 0 → but the rule only says for 1 or 2.

So what does the mediator do if 0 delegate?

The problem doesn’t say.

But it says: *"the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it."*

So **only when a player delegates**, the mediator acts *for them* — otherwise, they act independently.

So if **0 delegates**, then no one is playing via the mediator → both choose independently.

If **1 delegates**, the mediator plays A1 for that player.

If **2 delegates**, the mediator plays A0 for both.

So the **mediator’s action is only used if the player delegates**.

Now, when 2 delegate: both get A0.

If 1 delegates, the delegator gets A1, the non-delegator gets to choose.

Now, suppose **the mediator is selected** (say M1 or M2, but same behavior).

Now, you must decide: delegate or not?

Let’s suppose your **belief** about the other player: they will choose a strategy to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s analyze potential outcomes.

---

#### Case 1: You delegate, other delegates
- Both get A0 → your score: 4
- Other player: 4

#### Case 2: You delegate, other does not delegate
- You get A1 (because 1 delegator → mediator plays A1)
- Other player chooses their own action (A0 or A1)

So, for other player, they can choose:
- If they play A0: get 20 (since you play A1) → because (A1 vs A0) → they get 20
- If they play A1: get 4

→ So they will play A0.

So outcome: you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 6 points, other gets 2.

Wait — is that right?

From matrix:
- You: A1, other: A0 → you get 6, other gets 2.

Yes.

So in this case:
- You: A1 → 6 points
- Other: A0 → 2 points

#### Case 3: You do not delegate, other delegates
- Other player gets A1 (since only one delegator)
- You choose your own action

Now, what should you do?

You can choose A0 or A1.

- If you play A0: you get 10 (because other plays A1) → (A0 vs A1) → you get 0? Wait!

Wait — from the matrix:

| You \ Other | A0 | A1 |
|-------------|----|----|
| A0          | 10,10 | 0,20 |
| A1          | 6,2 | 4,4 |

So if you play A0, other plays A1 → you get **0**, other gets 20

If you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4, other gets 4

So you get 0 or 4.

So you prefer A1 → get 4.

So you will play A1.

Then: you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4, other gets 4.

So outcome: you get 4, other gets 4.

#### Case 4: Neither delegates
- Both choose actions independently.

Now, other player will play optimally.

We already established earlier: in the base game, **A1 is strictly dominant for the other player**.

Even if you choose A0 or A1, they always prefer A1.

So other will play A1.

You choose: A0 → 0, A1 → 4 → so you play A1.

Thus, outcome: both play A1 → you get 4.

---

### **Summarize outcomes of delegation decisions:**

| Your Delegation | Other's Delegation | Your Action | Other's Action | Your Score | Other's Score |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Yes              | Yes                | A0           | A0             | 4          | 4              |
| Yes              | No                 | A1           | A0             | 6          | 2              |
| No               | Yes                | A1           | A1             | 4          | 4              |
| No               | No                 | A1           | A1             | 4          | 4              |

Now, for **you**, your scores:
- Delegating + other delegates: 4
- You delegate + other doesn't: 6
- You don't delegate + other delegates: 4
- Neither: 4

So **your best outcome** is when you delegate **and other does not delegate** → you get 6.

But other player wants **to maximize their own score**.

Let’s analyze their incentives.

---

### **Other player's best responses**

Case 1: They delegate, you delegate → they get 4

Case 2: They delegate, you don’t → they get A1, you get A1 → they get 4

Case 3: They don’t delegate, you delegate → they get A0, you get A1 → they get 2

Case 4: Neither delegate → they get A1, you get A1 → they get 4

So for other player:
- If they delegate: they get 4 (cases 1 and 2)
- If they don’t delegate: they get 4 (case 4), or 2 (case 3) → so if you delegate, they get 2 if they don’t → so they prefer to delegate → get 4

So **if you delegate**, other player’s best response: **delegate** → because they get 4 vs 2

If you don’t delegate:
- If they delegate: get 4
- If they don’t: get 4
→ indifferent

So they can choose either.

Now, **your best outcome** is to **delegate**, and hope the other does **not** delegate → you get 6

But if you delegate, they will **definitely delegate** → because it gives them 4 instead of 2.

So in that case: both delegate → you get 4

But if you **don’t delegate**, and other **doesn’t delegate** → both play A1 → you get 4

Or if other **does** delegate → you get 4 (since you play A1), they play A1 → you get 4

So no matter what, you get **at most 4**?

Wait — your only path to 6 is if you delegate and other does **not**, but other **won’t** do that — because if you delegate, they get 2 if they don’t, 4 if they do → they will delegate.

So **you cannot achieve 6**, because other player will **always** choose to delegate **if you delegate**, and if you don’t, they may or may not.

But in the **not delegate** case:

- If you don’t delegate:
  - If other delegates → they get A1, you play A1 → you get 4
  - If other doesn’t → both play A1 → you get 4

So in both cases, you get 4.

So **no matter what you do in the delegation phase, your expected score is 4**, **as long as the other player is rational**.

Wait — is that true?

Yes: if you delegate → they delegate → you get 4

If you don’t delegate → you get 4 anyway

So **your score is 4 regardless** of your action in the delegation phase.

But what if you **don’t delegate**, and the other player **doesn’t** delegate? → both play A1 → you get 4

What if you don’t delegate, other delegates → other plays A1, you play A1 → you get 4

So your score is **always 4** in the delegation phase, **if the other player is rational**.

But earlier we saw that in the base game, you get 4 — so **you gain nothing**.

But wait — what if you can induce a **different outcome**?

Only possible way to get 6 is if you play A1 and other plays A0.

But if you delegate, and you are the only one, then you play A1, but other plays A0 only if they choose not to delegate.

But if they don’t delegate, and you delegate → they get 2 → they won't do that.

So they will **delegate** → play A1 → you both play A1 → you get 4.

So you **cannot get 6**.

Is there any way to get **more than 4**?

What if **no one delegates**, and you play A0?

But to get 10, you need the other to play A0.

But the other player **will not** play A0 unless you play A0 → then they get 10, but if they play A1, they get 20.

So they will **never** play A0.

So **you cannot get the (A0,A0) outcome** because the other player won’t choose A0.

So **maximum possible for you is 10**, but only if they play A0.

But they only play A0 if they get more from it.

But when you play A0: they get 10 if they play A0, 20 if they play A1 → so they prefer A1.

So (A0,A0) is not sustainable.

Similarly, (A0,A1) → you get 0, they get 20 → bad for you.

So **you can never get 10**, and only possibility to get more than 4 is 6.

But 6 is only possible if you play A1 and other plays A0.

But other player gets only 2 in that case, but gets 4 if they play A1 → so they will **not** play A0.

So they will never play A0.

So the only stable outcome is (A1,A1) → you get 4.

So **with the mediator, you still get at most 4**, same as base game.

But what if you **approve a mediator**, and **you and the other player both commit** to delegating?

Then both get A0 → you get 4.

Same as before.

But what if you **approve a mediator**, and you **don’t delegate**, but other delegates?

Then other plays A1, you play A1 → you get 4.

Still 4.

So in all cases, your score is 4.

But **is there a way to get more**?

Wait — what if **you can make the mediator play A0 when one delegates**?

But that’s bad — you get 4.

But if **only one delegates**, the mediator plays A1 → which is good for you if you are the only delegator — but then other player plays A0? No — they will play A1.

So even if you delegate and it's the only one, other gets 20 if they play A0 — so they won’t.

So they will play A1.

So you get A1, they get A1 → 4.

So **no gain**.

Thus, **the mediator doesn’t help you** — you still get 4.

But wait — what if the **other player is not rational**?

But we assume **both are rational**, so we can predict their behavior.

So you cannot get better than 4.

But here’s a twist: what if you **don’t approve any mediator**?

Then no mediator is selected.

Then you are forced to **act independently**.

Then, as before, other player plays A1 (dominant), you play A1 → you get 4.

Same.

So regardless of approval, your expected score is 4.

But now — if you **approve both mediators**, then no matter what the other player does, **a mediator is selected** (because at least one of M1 or M2 is approved by you).

If you approve **only one**, say M1, and other player approves only M2, then both have 1 approval → one is selected at random → still a mediator is selected.

Only if **you approve neither**, and **other approves neither**, then no mediator.

But if you approve **none**, and other approves **none**, then no mediator → you are forced to act independently → you get 4.

But if you approve **one**, and other approves **none**, then that one has 1 approval → wins → mediator is chosen.

So **only if you approve no mediator and other approves no mediator** is there no mediator.

But if you approve **at least one**, then **some mediator wins**.

So to **guarantee** that a mediator exists, **you should approve at least one**.

But since you **don’t care** about the mediator (they are identical), and **your score is 4 in all cases**, but if you **don’t approve any**, you risk **no mediator** being selected — but only if other player also disapproves all.

But if you approve **at least one**, you guarantee a mediator is selected.

Now, is that beneficial?

From your score perspective: **no**, because in all cases, you get 4.

But is there a **tiny risk** of getting less if no mediator?

Only if you don't approve any, and other doesn't, then you get 4 anyway.

Same as always.

So **no difference**.

But you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Since **all outcomes give you 4**, it doesn’t matter.

But wait — **what if the other player is irrational**?

But we assume rational players.

So **all strategies yield 4**.

But perhaps you can **induce the other player to approve** a mediator?

No — they are playing to maximize their own score.

Let’s see: for the other player, what happens?

If a mediator is selected:
- If they delegate and you don’t: they get A1, you play A1 → they get 4
- If they don’t delegate and you do: they get A0, you get A1 → they get 2
- If both delegate: they get A0 → 4
- If neither: both play A1 → 4

But if they don’t delegate, and you delegate → they get 2 → bad.

So they prefer to delegate **if you delegate**.

If you don’t delegate, they are indifferent.

So they may still delegate.

But their expected score is 4 in all cases.

So they are indifferent.

But now, back to your action: **do you benefit from approving a mediator?**

Only if it **increases the chance of a mediator being selected** — but since in all cases you get 4, you don’t gain.

But **if you approve a mediator**, you make it more likely that a mediator exists.

But in no case does the absence of a mediator hurt you.

So why approve?

But the problem is: **you must approve or disapprove** — and you want to **maximize your score**.

Since all configurations give you 4, **any approval choice is equally good**.

But we must pick one.

But here’s a key point: **if you disapprove a mediator, you might prevent it from winning**.

But since both are identical, and you get 4 regardless, it doesn't matter.

But suppose the other player thinks: “If I don’t approve any, no mediator, then I play normally.”

They get 4.

If I approve, a mediator might be selected — but they get 4 anyway.

So they are indifferent.

But if you **approve both**, then **no matter what** the other player does, a mediator is selected.

If you approve **only one**, and the other approves **only the other**, then both have 1 approval, so one is picked at random — still selected.

Only if **you approve none** and **other approves none**, then no selection.

But if you approve **at least one**, then a moderator exists.

So to **ensure** a mediator exists, you should approve **at least one**.

But since you get 4 anyway, **it doesn't matter**.

But the **only way to be sure** a mediator is selected is to approve at least one.

But in no case do you lose.

So **you should approve both**, because it doesn't hurt, and ensures that the mediator is selected, and doesn't affect your payoff.

But there’s no benefit.

But wait — what if the other player is **benevolent** and wants to help you?

But we cannot assume that.

Assume rational self-interest.

But in all cases, you get 4.

So your choice doesn't matter.

But you must choose.

The safest is to **approve both** — because then, no matter what the other player does, you are guaranteed a mediator is selected.

Even if they disapprove all others, your approved one wins.

If you approve only one, and they approve only the other, it's still selected (randomly).

Only if you approve none and they approve none, no selection.

But if you approve both, you cover all cases.

But since your payoff is 4 in all cases, it doesn't matter.

But let’s consider a **worst-case**.

Suppose you approve **none**.

Then:
- If other approves both: a mediator is selected → you get 4
- If other approves one: that one is selected → you get 4
- If other approves none: no mediator → you get 4

So always 4.

Similarly, if you approve one, always 4.

So **all approval choices are equally good**.

But you must pick one.

But the problem is: the mediators are proposed by players, but have no difference.

So **you should approve both**, to be safe.

But wait — let’s think about the **other player’s incentive**.

Suppose you approve **only M1**.

Then if the other player approves only M2, we have a tie → random selection.

But they might prefer M2 over M1? But they are identical.

So no difference.

But if you approve **both**, you are more likely to have the mediator you want?

But there is no difference.

So **approve both**.

But is there a reason to approve only one?

No.

So **approve both**.

---

### **Final Decision**

Both mediators are identical in behavior.

Approving both ensures that a mediator is selected regardless of the other player's choices.

Approving fewer may risk no mediator only in rare cases, but since payoff is same, it doesn't matter.

But to be safe and inclusive, **approve both**.

Thus:

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the basic game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 10     | 2      |
| **P2: A1** | 20     | 4      |

In the basic game, A1 strictly dominates A0 for me (20 > 10 and 4 > 2).

## Step 2: Analyze what happens with delegation

When I delegate (A2):
- If only I delegate (P1 plays A0 or A1): Mediator plays A1 for me
- If both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both

This creates the following expanded payoff matrix for me (Player 2):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 | P1: A2 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 10     | 2      | 2      |
| **P2: A1** | 20     | 4      | 4      |
| **P2: A2** | 20     | 4      | 10     |

## Step 3: Check for domination

Comparing strategies:
- A2 vs A1: A2 gives (20, 4, 10) vs A1 gives (20, 4, 4). A2 weakly dominates A1.
- A2 vs A0: A2 gives (20, 4, 10) vs A0 gives (10, 2, 2). A2 strictly dominates A0.

So A2 is my best strategy.

## Step 4: Predict Player 1's behavior

For Player 1, the payoff matrix is:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 | P2: A2 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 10     | 0      | 0      |
| **P1: A1** | 6      | 4      | 4      |
| **P1: A2** | 10     | 4      | 10     |

A2 weakly dominates both A0 and A1 for Player 1.

## Step 5: Find the Nash equilibrium

If both players delegate (A2, A2):
- Both get 10 points (the mediator plays A0 for both)
- This is a Nash equilibrium: neither player wants to deviate
- If I deviated to A1, I'd get only 4 points (vs current 10)
- If P1 deviated to A1, they'd get only 4 points (vs current 10)

This is also Pareto optimal compared to the original game's equilibrium of (A1, A1) giving only (4, 4).

## Conclusion

The rational strategy is to delegate to the mediator, which coordinates us to the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

response:
Let's break down the game step by step to maximize our total points.

First, let's consider the payoffs without the mediator:
1. If we choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: Both get 10 points.
2. If we choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: We get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
3. If we choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: We get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
4. If we choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: Both get 4 points.

Next, let's examine the impact of the mediator:
1. If we delegate to the mediator (A2) and the other player does not:
   - The mediator plays A1 for us.
   - If the other player chooses A0, we get 20 points.
   - If the other player chooses A1, we get 4 points.

2. If both we and the other player delegate to the mediator:
   - The mediator plays A0 for both of us.
   - Both of us get 10 points since the outcome will be (A0, A0).

Given this, delegation seems beneficial if the other player also delegates to the mediator, resulting in both players getting 10 points.

### Steps to Determine the Best Strategy:
1. **Risk of A1 backfiring:** Choosing A1 has a high reward (20 points if the other player chooses A0), but a suboptimal payoff (4 points if the other player chooses A1).
2. **Safe choice of A0:** Playing A0 leaves us with either 10 points or 2 points.
3. **Delegation:** Encourages mutual cooperation for a steady 10 points if both players delegate.

### Balancing the Probabilities:
1. **Delegation can be a strong option:** Given that both delegating results consistently in 10 points.
2. **Mix of A0 and A1:** To keep the strategy non-deterministic and to balance risk, we can allocate some probability to playing A0 and A1 independently.

Here’s a proposed probability distribution:
- **Probability for A2 (Delegation to Mediator):** Since we want to encourage cooperation, assigning a high probability to A2 increases the chance of mutual delegation.
- **Probability for A0:** This is a safe move, albeit less likely to maximize points unilaterally.
- **Probability for A1:** Assigning some probability to A1 retains the high-reward option if the other player chooses A0.

### Proposed Probability Distribution:
- Assign a higher probability to A2 to encourage the mediator's use.
- Distribute the remaining probabilities between A0 and A1 to allow for some variance and strategic play.

Given that, my final proposed probability distribution is:
- **A0:** 20%
- **A1:** 10%
- **A2:** 70%

Here is the final JSON object:

{"A0": 20, "A1": 10, "A2": 70}

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which mediators you should approve, based on your goal of **maximizing your expected points** as Player 1.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**
We have a simultaneous-move game between two players (Player 1 and Player 2), with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff Matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2’s payoff):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 10, 10       | 0, 20        |
| **Player 1: A1** | 6, 2         | 4, 4         |

This is a variant of the "Battle of the Sexes" or coordination game with asymmetric incentives.

We’ll analyze best responses later, but for now, note:
- A0 vs A0: 10–10 (good for both)
- A0 vs A1: 0–20 (bad for you, good for opponent)
- A1 vs A0: 6–2 (you get 6, opponent gets 2)
- A1 vs A1: 4–4 (both get 4)

So you strongly prefer:
- A0 if opponent picks A0
- A1 if opponent picks A1

But opponent prefers A0 when you play A0, and A1 when you play A1.

This is a **coordination game with conflict of interest**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You and the other player will:
1. **Approve mediators** (via approval voting).
2. **The mediator with the most approvals wins**, selected **uniformly at random** if tied.
3. Then, **if you delegate**, the mediator plays *on your behalf*, based on *how many players have delegated to it*.

Importantly:
- You can choose to **delegate** or **act independently**.
- But **approval comes first** – you must decide which mediators to approve, before knowing who else approves what.

So, your approval choice affects which mediator is used (or whether one is even selected), and thus what your action will be (if you delegate), or whether you can influence the outcome via delegation.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Two Mediator Proposals**

Both mediators are **identical in behavior**:

> **Mediator M1 (Player 1's proposal)**  
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0  

> **Mediator M2 (Player 2's proposal)**  
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0  

So **M1 and M2 are functionally identical**.

Therefore, **you should approve both or neither — their behavior doesn’t differentiate them**.

But: **Why does having two identical mediators matter?**

Now, **you are participating in an approval voting process**:
- Players can approve any subset.
- The **winner is selected uniformly at random from those with the *max* approvals**.

So if you approve both, and other players approve one or both, you increase the chance that **one of the two identical mediators is selected**.

But since they’re identical, **the outcome is the same regardless of which one is chosen**.

So, **approving both is equivalent to approving one**, because the resulting behavior is identical.

So what’s the best strategy?

---

### **Step 4: Consider What Happens When You Delegate**

Suppose you delegate to **a mediator**. Then:
- The mediator’s action depends on the **total number of players who delegate to it**.

Let’s define the possibilities:

#### Case 1: Only you delegate to the mediator
- Number of delegations = 1 → mediator plays **A1**

So you play A1 (if you delegate)

Your payoff depends on what the **other player does**.

But: **the other player may delegate or not**.

But here’s a subtlety: the game is sequential in structure:
1. First: **Approvals**
2. Then: Decide whether to delegate or not
3. Then: Actions are determined (either by independent choice or by mediator)

But **when you choose whether to delegate**, you have to consider:
- What mediator gets selected (depends on approval outcome)
- Whether the other player delegates or not

But you **don't know** in advance who else approves or delegates.

So you have to consider the **expected value**, **based on possible scenarios**.

But since you’re only choosing **which mediators to approve**, we need to evaluate: **Does approving a mediator help you maximize your expected payoff?**

---

### **Step 5: What If You Delegate?**

Let’s analyze delegation with the **identical mediators**.

Suppose the mediator **is selected** (i.e., it gets the most approvals, or ties with others). Then:
- If **only one player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **two players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So, coordination by delegation leads to:
- If you both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get 10
- If only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → that person gets 4 (if they’re the only one) or 6 (if they’re playing A1 and opponent plays A0) — depends.

Wait — need to be careful.

Let’s suppose:
- You decide to delegate **to the chosen mediator**
- The mediator plays based on **how many players have delegated to it**

So if **you** delegate and **opponent doesn’t**, then **only one** departs → mediator plays A1

→ So you get **what you get if you play A1 and opponent plays whatever they play**

But — **you are delegating**, so your action is fixed by the mediator.

→ **You are forced to play A1** in this case.

Similarly, if **both** delegate, the mediator plays A0 → both of you play A0 → both get 10.

So delegation gives you **benefits only when both delegate**, because then you get 10 (instead of 6 or 4).

But such coordination requires **both players to choose to delegate**.

And you can only influence that if you can **make it more likely** that the mediator leads to the coordinate outcome.

But here’s the key:

**The mediator aggregates behavior:**

- If **both players delegate**, they **both are assigned A0**, so you both get 10.
- If **only one delegates**, **that player is assigned A1**.

So the mediator leads to **coordinated A0 only when both delegate**.

Otherwise, **only the delegator gets A1**, and their opponent plays independently.

So the **only way to get 10 is to coordinate both delegating**, so you get A0, and the opponent also gets A0.

But, the **opponent** may not want this.

From the payoff matrix:
- If opponent plays A0, and you play A0 → both get 10 → good for both
- If opponent plays A1, and you play A1 → both get 4 → worse than 10

So both players prefer A0-A0.

BUT: the opponent may prefer to avoid A0 if they expect you to play A1 (since they get 20 from A0 vs A1).

Wait, if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → opponent gets 20.

So opponent **wants to play A1 if you play A0**.

But if you play A1 and they play A0 → they get 2 → bad for them.

So they **want to coordinate on A0 only if they can get A0**.

But in summary:
- A0-A0: best for both (10 each)
- A1-A1: both get 4 (bad for both)
- A0-A1: you get 0, opponent gets 20 — exploitative
- A1-A0: you get 6, opponent gets 2

So **A0-A0 is the unique Pareto efficient outcome**.

But there is a **risk of miscoordination**: both players want to coordinate, but it’s easy to drift into A0-A1 or A1-A0.

Now, **delegation can help coordinate**.

Specifically:
- If **both players delegate to a mediator**, that mediator **plays A0** → both get 10.
- That’s the best outcome.

So if you can **induce coordination**, you get 10.

But if only one delegates, then that person gets A1 → so if you delegate and opponent doesn’t, you play A1.

What do you get then?

You play A1, opponent plays what they choose.

But you can't predict what the opponent does.

But since **you are the only one delegated**, the mediator plays A1 ⇒ you play A1.

So your payoff depends on what the opponent plays.

From the payoff matrix:
- If opponent plays A0 → you get 6
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 4

So **average** – assuming they play A0 or A1 with some probability – you get between 4 and 6.

But without information, worst case: you get 4 if they play A1.

But if you act independently, you could choose A0 or A1 based on your beliefs.

But you are trying to maximize expected payoff.

So let’s analyze the incentives.

---

### **Step 6: Compare Delegation vs Independent Play**

Suppose you **do not delegate** — you choose your own action.

Then you can choose a mixed strategy.

Let’s find the **Nash equilibria** of the base game.

Let:
- p = your prob of A0
- q = opponent’s prob of A0

Your expected payoff if you play A0:  
10*q + 0*(1−q) = 10q

If you play A1:  
6*q + 4*(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

You’re indifferent if:
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So if opponent plays A0 with 50%, you're indifferent.

For your best response:
- If q > 0.5 → you prefer A0
- If q < 0.5 → you prefer A1

Similarly, opponent’s payoff:
- A0: 10p + 20(1−p) = 10p + 20 − 20p = 20 − 10p
- A1: 2p + 4(1−p) = 2p + 4 − 4p = 4 − 2p

Set equal: 20 − 10p = 4 − 2p → 16 = 8p → p = 2 → impossible.

So opponent’s best response:
- 20 − 10p > 4 − 2p → 16 > 8p → p < 2 → always true

Wait: 20 − 10p > 4 − 2p → 16 > 8p → p < 2 → **always true**

So opponent **always prefers A1** when p < 2, which is always.

Wait, no: when p = 0 → opponent gets 20 from A1, 10 from A0 → prefers A1

When p = 1 → opponent gets 20 from A1, 10 from A0 → still prefers A1

Wait, is that right?

Wait: if opponent plays A0 and you play A0 → they get 10  
If opponent plays A1 and you play A0 → they get 20

Yes — so **whenever you play A0**, opponent prefers A1 → they get 20 > 10

When you play A1:
- Opponent plays A0 → gets 2
- Opponent plays A1 → gets 4 → prefers A1

So **no matter what you do**, opponent's best response is to play A1!

This is critical.

**Opponent’s dominant strategy is A1.**

Because:
- When you play A0 → opponent gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- When you play A1 → opponent gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So A1 is strictly dominant for **Player 2**.

So **in equilibrium, Player 2 will always play A1**, regardless of what you do.

Now, your best response to A1:
- Play A0: 0 points
- Play A1: 4 points

So you should play A1.

So the unique **Nash equilibrium** is: (A1, A1) → both get 4.

But wait — what about coordination?

Is it possible to coordinate on A0-A0?

Only if both players agree.

But **Player 2 has no incentive** to play A0 — they always get more from A1, no matter what you do.

So **in a non-cooperative setting, Player 2 will always play A1**, making A0 unattractive.

So unless **something forces coordination**, you’ll end up with A1-A1 (4,4).

So the **only way to get 10** is to **induce a cooperative outcome**, which requires **both players to be willing to deviate** from dominant strategy.

Now, delegation can help **coordinate** the outcome.

Let’s suppose both players **delegate** to a mediator.

Then, **since both delegate**, the mediator plays **A0**.

So both play A0 → both get 10.

That’s better than 4.

So **coordination via delegation** leads to a better outcome.

But: **will they both delegate?**

Only if **each player believes both will delegate** → leading to A0, yielding 10.

But if **only one delegates**, then that player plays A1 (since only one delegate), so they get:
- 6 if opponent plays A0 → but opponent doesn’t play A0 (opponent plays A1) → so they get 4
- Or if opponent plays A0 — but they don’t.

From earlier: **Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1**, so unless they delegate, they will play A1.

So if you delegate → you play A1 → opponent plays A1 → you get 4.

If you don’t delegate and play A1 → you get 4.

So same.

But if you delegate and **both delegate**, both play A0 → you get 10.

So **you benefit from coordination only if both delegate**.

But if only you delegate, you get 4 (same as acting independently and playing A1).

So the **only incentive to delegate is if you expect the other player to also delegate**, so that you get A0.

But the other player also knows this.

So if they delegate → they play A0 if both delegate → they get 10.

But if only they delegate → they play A1 → and you play A1 → they get 4.

So same issue.

But now, **the mediator’s rule** is **based on number of delegations**, not individual choices.

So the **key insight**: **If both players delegate, they both play A0 and get 10.**

So delegation can **create a coordination device**.

But only if **both players are willing to delegate**.

Now, your role: **you decide which mediators to approve**.

And the mediator is chosen at random from all with **maximum approvals**.

So your approval strategy affects which mediator is selected.

But both mediators are identical.

So **approving both** increases the chance that a mediator with **high approval count** is selected.

But more importantly — if you approve a mediator, you are **allowing it to be a candidate**, which might **increase its chance** of winning.

Now, suppose **you approve both M1 and M2**.

Then, if **you** are a **major upvote**, you increase the likelihood that one of them gets high approvals.

But if you **don’t approve any**, and others also don’t, then no mediator is selected.

The problem says: **“the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.”**

So if **no one approves any**, then no mediator has any approvals → max approvals = 0, but no one has approvals → undefined?

Probably the game assumes at least one mediator is approved.

But we’re to **approve** or **not**.

So to ensure **a mediator is selected**, you might want to approve one.

But more importantly: **if a mediator is selected, you can delegate to it**.

But you also act independently if you don’t delegate.

Now, here’s the **crucial point:** you are trying to **maximize your expected points**.

Your actions (approve or not) are **before** you know how others behave.

Suppose:
- You approve **both mediators** → increases chance that a mediator is **selected** (and is used).
- But the **mediator’s action** depends only on number of delegators.

But the **mediator is selected based on approvals**, not on delegation.

So even if both mediators are approved, only **one is chosen** (randomly, among max-approved).

But behavior is identical.

So whether you approve M1 or M2 or both — as long as at least one is approved, **you can use a mediator** (if selected).

But now: **can you benefit from delegating if the outcome is better?**

Yes — if **both players delegate**, then both get 10.

But for that to happen, **you must delegate** to the mediator (if selected), and **opponent must also delegate**.

But you don’t control opponent’s actions.

So you have to consider the **expected payoff** based on **outcomes**.

But since you don’t know what others approve, you need to consider **strategic stability**.

But here’s a different idea: **If you approve a mediator, you are enabling it to be used.**

But if you **don’t approve**, then you prevent it from being selected, which might hurt coordination.

But if you **do approve**, you increase the chance that *some* mediator is selected (assuming others may approve it too).

But **both mediators are identical**, so it doesn’t matter which one is chosen.

Now, what if you **approve neither**?

Then **no mediator is ever selected** (since no one has approvals), so delegation is impossible.

Then you must play independently.

And in that case, as we saw, **Player 2 plays A1 (dominant strategy)**.

You play A1 → you get 4.

Alternatively, if you play A0 → you get 0.

So your best is A1 → get 4.

So outcome is 4.

But if **you approve a mediator**, and **assumption is** that **if the mediator is selected**, **and both players delegate**, you get 10.

But **you don't control the other player**.

But here’s a thought: **if you approve both mediators**, and the mediator is selected, **you can delegate to it**.

But the **other player** also has to delegate.

But if they think **both players will delegate**, and that leads to A0-A0 (10,10), they benefit.

So **both players have incentive to delegate** if they believe the other will too.

So delegation can **support a cooperative equilibrium**.

But can you **induce that**?

Yes — by **approving the mediator**, you make it a **feasible coordination device**.

In fact, approving the mediator **signals your willingness to coordinate**.

But if you **approve neither**, then no delegation possible → you’re stuck at (A1,A1) → 4.

So **approving a mediator (or both) gives the possibility of coordinating on A0-A0**, which gives you 10.

Whereas not approving forces 4.

Thus, **you should approve the mediators** to enable coordination.

But is there a risk?

Suppose you approve one, but **opponent does not approve** — so no mediator is selected → distance.

Or suppose you approve, opponent doesn’t.

But if **you approve a mediator**, and it gets approved by others, it can be selected.

But **if you don’t approve**, no mediator can be selected **ever**.

So the **only way to get the 10** is to **have a mediator selected**.

And the only way to have a mediator selected is to **approve at least one**.

Therefore, **to have a chance at 10, you must approve at least one mediator**.

Since both are identical, *approving both is safe* — it doesn’t hurt, and increases the chance that **some** mediator is selected and has high approval, thus increasing likelihood it’s chosen.

If you approve **one**, and the other player also approves it, then it has 2 approvals → wins.

If you approve **both**, and opponent approves one, then both mediators have 1 approval → both tied → one chosen uniformly → still possible.

If you approve both and opponent approves neither, then your two approvals are max → one chosen (randomly) → still selected.

So **approving both** ensures that **at least one mediator is selected** (if you approve at least one), and **maximizes the chance** that it's selected.

Whereas if you approve only one, and opponent approves only the other, then both have 1 approval → could be selected — but the one you approved may not be chosen.

But since they are identical, it doesn't matter.

But **approving both guarantees that you support the mechanism**, and **has no downside**.

In contrast, **approving neither** means **no mediator can be selected**, so delegation impossible, so you’re stuck with 4.

So **approving neither is worse**.

Now, do you want to approve **both**?

Yes — because:

- It enables the possibility of coordination.
- It ensures your support for the mechanism regardless of what others do.
- There is no downside (since mediators are identical).
- It increases the likelihood that a mediator is selected (since more people can approve it).

Therefore, to **maximize your expected points**, you should **approve both mediators**.

Because:
- If no mediator is selected, your max is 4.
- If a mediator is selected and you can delegate, and coordination occurs, you get 10.
- The only way to get 10 is to have a mediator selected → which requires **you to approve at least one**.
- Approving both increases the chance this happens.
- No cost.

Even if you don’t delegate, you could still benefit from others delegating, but you can’t control that.

But **you can only delegate if the mediator is selected**.

So **to have the option, you must approve**.

And since you are trying to maximize expected points, and 10 > 4, you want to **enable the chance**.

Moreover, **the other player also benefits** from the mediator (if both delegate), so they may also approve.

But even if they don’t, you’ve still **enabled the mechanism**.

But if you don’t approve any, **no mechanism exists** → you’re punished.

So **approving both is strictly better** than approving neither.

Approving one or both: same in outcome, but **approving both gives more robustness**.

Therefore, **you should approve both**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which mediators we should approve.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

This is a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action | Other Player’s Action | Your Points | Other Player’s Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 10          | 10                     |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 20                     |
| A1          | A0                     | 6           | 2                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 4           | 4                      |

We are Player 1.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria or dominant strategies.

- If you play **A0**, your expected payoff depends on the opponent:
  - If opponent plays A0 → 10
  - If opponent plays A1 → 0
- If you play **A1**, your expected payoff:
  - If opponent plays A0 → 6
  - If opponent plays A1 → 4

Now, let’s compute the best response for each player.

#### Best Responses:

- If opponent plays **A0**, your best response: A0 (10 > 6)
- If opponent plays **A1**, your best response: A1 (4 > 0)

So:
- A0 is best response to A0.
- A1 is best response to A1.

This suggests a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

But let’s see what happens if both players are rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s suppose both players use a **mixed strategy**:
- You play A0 with probability $ p $
- Opponent plays A0 with probability $ q $

Your expected payoff if you play A0:
$$
10q + 0(1 - q) = 10q
$$

Your expected payoff if you play A1:
$$
6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4
$$

Set equal for indifference (in equilibrium):
$$
10q = 2q + 4 \Rightarrow 8q = 4 \Rightarrow q = 0.5
$$

Similarly, for the opponent:
- If you play A0 with probability $ p $, the opponent’s payoff from A0 is:
  $ 10p + 2(1 - p) = 8p + 2 $
- From A1: $ 20p + 4(1 - p) = 16p + 4 $

Set equal for opponent indifference:
$$
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 \Rightarrow -8p = 2 \Rightarrow p = -0.25
$$

Wait — negative probability? That can't be right.

Wait — let’s correct this.

Opponent’s payoff:
- If opponent plays A0: gets 10 (if you play A0) or 2 (if you play A1) → $ 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2 $
- If opponent plays A1: gets 20 (if you play A0) or 4 (if you play A1) → $ 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4 $

To make the opponent indifferent, set:
$$
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 \Rightarrow -8p = 2 \Rightarrow p = -0.25
$$

Impossible. That means there is **no mixed strategy equilibrium** where both are indifferent.

But wait — this implies that **A1 dominates nothing**, but let's check for **pure strategy equilibria**.

Check for pure equilibria:

1. (A0, A0): Is this stable?
   - You get 10. If you deviate to A1, you get 6 → worse. So no incentive.
   - Opponent gets 10. If deviates to A1, gets 20 → better. So **not stable**.

2. (A0, A1): You get 0, opponent gets 20.
   - You want to switch to A1 → get 4 (vs 0) → better. Not stable.
   - Opponent wants to switch to A0 → get 2 (vs 20) → worse. So not stable.

3. (A1, A0): You get 6, opponent gets 2.
   - You: if switch to A0 → get 10 → better → not stable.
   - Opponent: if switch to A1 → get 4 → better → not stable.

4. (A1, A1): You get 4, opponent gets 4.
   - You: switch to A0 → get 0 (worse)
   - Opponent: switch to A0 → get 2 (worse)
   - So **both have no incentive to deviate**

✅ Therefore, **(A1, A1)** is the unique **Nash equilibrium**.

So in the base game, without delegation, rational players will converge to **both playing A1**, earning 4 points each.

---

### **Step 2: Now introduce the delegation mechanism**

You can choose to:
- Act independently
- Delegate to a mediator

But **first**, there is a **approval voting process** to select a mediator.

There are **two mediators** proposed:
- M1: Proposed by Player 1
- M2: Proposed by Player 2

But **both have identical rules**:

> - If **1 player** delegates to the mediator → it plays **A1**
> - If **2 players** delegate to the mediator → it plays **A0**

So M1 and M2 are **identical in behavior**.

That means **both mediators will behave exactly the same**, regardless of who proposed them.

So your choice of approval should be based on **expected outcome**, not on proposer.

But note: **only one mediator will be chosen**, and it will be selected **uniform at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So your approval affects the chance that your preferred mediator is selected — but since both are identical, **you cannot gain from favoring one over the other**.

But there's a twist: **you can approve both, one, or none**.

Your goal: **maximize your expected points**, considering the delegation mechanism.

Let’s analyze what happens in the delegation scenario.

---

### **Step 3: Game with delegation and mediation**

Key points:

- You and the opponent **each** decide independently whether to **delegate** or **act independently**.
- Then, **approval voting** determines which mediator is used.
- The **mediator is selected uniformly at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.
- Once selected, the mediator plays based on **how many players delegated to it**.

But: **You and the opponent make delegation decisions simultaneously**, **after** the approval vote (wait — no, actually, the sequence is important).

Wait — the problem says:

> “First, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game.”

Then: “Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of.”

Then: “On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.”

So the **approval voting is a separate stage** — **before** the main game, and the **mediator is fixed** for the game once chosen via this voting.

But it’s **not specified** when the other player makes their approval decisions.

However, the instruction says: **"Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of."**

So you’re to make your **approval choices now**, **before** knowing what the other player will do, but **before** the delegation decision.

So we must assume that **both players make their approval decisions simultaneously**, and then the mediator is selected.

Then, after the mediator is selected, **both players choose independently** whether to delegate or not.

The **key** is: **you are to decide your approvals now**, and the **other player is also doing the same**, but we are to assume rational play.

But **we don’t know the other player’s preferences**.

But since both mediators are identical, **approving both or one has no effect on mediator outcome**, **unless** the other player approves differently.

But since both mediators are behaviorally identical, **it doesn’t matter which one is selected**.

So **you should approve both**, because:
- You don't lose by approving both.
- If the other player approves only one, then your approval (if both approved) leads to **both with max approval**, so the mediator is chosen at random between them — but since they are identical, it’s irrelevant.
- If you approve only one, and the other player approves only one (possibly different), you might get only one with max approval → the winning mediator is the approved one → but since both behave the same, still irrelevant.

But more importantly: **if you disapprove of a mediator, it can't win**.

So:
- If you disapprove of M1, but approve M2, then M1 is eliminated from contention.
- If you disapprove of both, then no mediator gets approval → what happens? The problem says “the winning mediator will be selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals”.

So if both have 0 approvals, then there are no mediators → the voting fails?

But the game must proceed — so probably the problem assumes that at least one mediator is approved.

But to make sure the game has a valid mediator, you should **approve at least one**.

But since both are identical, there's no difference.

So **you should approve both** to increase the chance that the mediator is selected — even though it doesn’t matter which.

But here’s an important twist: **what if the other player approves only one?**

Then if you approve only the same one, both get approval counts of 1 (if other player approved only that one), so both are tied → then winner chosen at random → you get equal chance.

But if you approve both, and the other player approves only one, then:
- That one has 1 approval (from opponent)
- The other has 2 approvals (from you and opponent is not approving it) → so the one you approved gets 2 votes

Wait: **no** — if **you approve both** and **opponent approves only M1**, then:
- M1: 2 approvals (you + opponent)
- M2: 1 approval (only you)

So M1 wins.

But since both mediators play the **same way**, it doesn’t matter.

But now let’s analyze the full game with delegation.

---

### **Step 4: Delegation Strategy – What matters**

Suppose a mediator is selected. It plays:
- A1 if **exactly one player delegates**
- A0 if **two players delegate**

Important: **The mediator does not know whether you are playing your own action or delegated. It only sees how many players delegate.**

So:
- If **only you delegate**, mediator plays A1
- If **only opponent delegates**, mediator plays A1
- If **both delegate**, mediator plays A0

Now, **if you delegate**, then your action is **entirely determined by the mediator**, based on the number of delegators.

So your action is **not directly chosen** — it’s determined by the **global delegation count**.

Now, the **other player** is also a rational player, trying to maximize their own points.

And you are trying to maximize your **own** points.

So you want to **coordinate on outcomes** that give you high payoff.

Let’s suppose we **both approve both mediators** (since they are identical). Then whichever is selected, the behavior is the same.

So effectively, **we can assume the mediator will behave the same no matter which one is selected**.

Now, model the **delegation phase**.

Each player chooses, independently, whether to **delegate** (D) or **act independently** (I).

There are four possibilities:

| You | Opponent | Delegation Count | Mediator's Action (You) | Mediator's Action (Opponent) | Your Points | Opponent's Points |
|-----|----------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| D   | D        | 2                | A0                       | A0                            | 10          | 10                |
| D   | I        | 1                | A1                       | ? (you don't know yet)         | ?           | ?                 |
| I   | D        | 1                | ?                        | A1                            | ?           | ?                 |
| I   | I        | 0                | ??? (not defined)             | ???                           | ???         | ???               |

Wait — **what happens if neither delegates?**

The mediator is still in the game — but **no one is delegating**, so the mediator is **not used**. But the game requires the mediator to act only if someone delegates. But the rules don’t specify what happens if **no one delegates**.

But the mediator is **present** — so the game must have a way to handle non-delegation.

Let’s reconsider the rules.

The rules say:
> “On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.”

So **if you do not delegate**, you act independently. So when no one delegates, **both act independently**.

So the **mediator is not used** in that case.

So the payoff depends on **your own choice**, which we will choose.

So in the case **no one delegates**, both play independently.

Now, you and the opponent each choose **whether to delegate or not**, and when you don’t delegate, you choose your **own action**.

Let’s clarify:

- If you delegate → your action is **determined by the mediator** based on total delegation count.
- If you **do not delegate** → you choose your own action (A0 or A1).

But the **only information the mediator uses** is how many people delegate — not who.

So the mediator’s action is public.

Now, the **opponent** is rational and will consider your strategy.

Let’s suppose that **both players are rational**, and we can find Nash equilibria.

Also, **you are not trying to maximize opponent’s points** — only your own.

So let’s explore possibilities.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze outcomes**

Let’s denote:
- Each player chooses: Delegate (D) or Independent (I)
- If I, then choose an action (A0 or A1)

But choosing I is not just about delegation — it involves choosing an action.

Let’s assume that if a player **does not delegate**, they will play optimally given the situation.

So we can consider **strategies**.

Let’s explore pure strategy equilibria.

#### Case 1: Both players delegate (D, D)

- Delegation count = 2 → mediator plays **A0** for both
- So you get 10 points
- Opponent gets 10 points

Can you gain by deviating?

If you switch to I (Independent), then:
- Delegation count = 1 (only opponent delegates)
- Mediator plays **A1**
- So **your action is A1**
- Opponent’s action is A0 (since they are delegating → A0)

So you play A1, opponent plays A0 → your payoff: 6

But if you deviated, you get **6** instead of **10** → worse.

So you won’t deviate.

Opponent: if they switch to I, same logic: now you play A1, opponent plays A0 → opponent gets 2 → worse than 10.

So (D, D) → (A0, A0) → both get 10 → **stable equilibrium**

Wait: but when both delegate, mediator plays A0 → so **both play A0** → yes, payoff 10 each.

If you deviate to I, then:
- You are not delegating → so you choose your own action
- Delegation count = 1 → mediator plays A1 for **opponent**
- So opponent plays A1
- You can choose: if you play A0, payoff = 0 (since opponent plays A1)
- If you play A1, payoff = 4
→ So you will choose A1 → get 4

But in (D,D), you get 10 → 4 < 10 → so better to stay in D.

So (D,D) is a Nash equilibrium → both get 10.

#### Case 2: You D, Opponent I

- Delegation count = 1 → mediator plays A1 for **you**
- You: **A1**
- Opponent: not delegating → chooses best action

Opponent sees: you play A1

- If opponent plays A0: payoff = 2
- If opponent plays A1: payoff = 4
→ So opponent plays A1

So outcome: you play A1, opponent plays A1 → both get 4

Can you deviate?

If you switch to I, then:
- No one delegates → both act independently
- You choose your action
- Opponent chooses their action

As we saw earlier, in the base game, (A1,A1) is the unique NE → both play A1 → you get 4

But previously, with D and opponent I, you were getting 4 (same)

Wait — same payoff: 4

But if you switch to I, you get 4 (same)

But you **might get more**?

No — in (I,I), both play A1 → you get 4

So you get **same** payoff.

But wait: in (D,I), you get 4 (from A1 vs A1)

In (I,I), you get 4 (same)

So no incentive to deviate.

But what if opponent deviates?

Opponent currently plays I → gets 4 (from A1)

If they switch to D → then both delegate → delegation count = 2 → mediator plays A0 → opponent plays A0

You play A1 (because you delegated)

So outcome: A1 vs A0 → you get 6, opponent gets 2 → worse than 4

So opponent would not want to deviate.

So (D,I) is also a Nash equilibrium? You get 4, opponent gets 4.

Wait: no — in (D,I):
- You: delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Opponent: independent → sees you play A1 → plays A1 → opp gets 4
- You get 4

Yes.

But now, could you get more?

But since both are equilibria, we have **multiple equilibria**.

But in (D,D), you get 10 → better than 4.

So (D,D) is better for you.

But the other player may prefer (D,D) too (10 each), so both would prefer that.

But is (D,D) the only one where both get high?

Yes.

But now, what about (I,I)?

In (I,I), both play independently → NE is (A1,A1) → both get 4.

But you can get 10 in (D,D) → so you prefer that.

But can you **coordinate** on (D,D)?

Only if both choose to delegate.

But what if you approve only one mediator?

No — both are identical.

But back to the **approval phase**.

You must decide which mediators to approve.

Remember: the **opponent** is also rational and will try to maximize their own points.

Now, consider a key insight:

In (D,D), **you both get 10** → best possible outcome for you.

But in (D,I) or (I,D), you both get 4 → worse.

In (I,I), you both get 4.

So **both players want to coordinate on (D,D)**.

But only if the mediator exists and is used.

But if **no mediator is selected** (e.g., if no one approves any mediator), then the game reverts to base rules → (A1,A1) with 4 points.

But you want to avoid that.

So you should **approve the mediator(s)** to **increase the chance** that it is selected.

But since both mediators are identical, approval of both is best.

But suppose you only approve M1, and opponent only approves M2 → then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 1 → both tie → winner chosen at random → mediator is selected (with 50% chance) → game proceeds.

But if you both approve only one, and it’s the same one, then that one wins.

But if you approve **both**, then **even if opponent approves only one**, your approval increases that one’s count.

But since both mediators are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But crucially: **if you disapprove of a mediator, you are decreasing the chance that it is selected.**

But since they are identical, **you should approve both** to **ensure** that the mediator is selected.

But is there any risk?

Suppose the other player disapproves **both** mediators.

Then:
- M1: 0 approvals (if you approve one) → only you approve one
- M2: 0 approvals
→ So maximum approvals is 0 → no mediator is selected → game reverts to independent play

Then: (A1,A1) → you get 4

But if you had approved at least one, and they approve at least one, then some mediator wins.

But you don’t know the other player’s approval.

But you want to **maximize your expected payoff**, given that the other player is rational.

Now, suppose you approve **both** mediators.

Then, no matter what the opponent does, **at least one mediator has at least 1 approval**, so **some mediator is selected**.

The only way no mediator is selected is if **you approve no one** AND opponent approves no one.

But if you approve **both**, then even if opponent approves nothing, you have approval → so **at least one mediator has 1 approval**, so it wins.

Therefore, by approving **both**, you **guarantee** that a mediator is selected.

If you approve only one, and opponent approves nothing, then the one you approved gets 1, opponent’s approval is 0 → it wins → still good.

But if you approve **only one**, and opponent approves **nothing**, then that one wins → same.

But if you approve **only one**, and opponent approves the **other**, then:
- Your one: 1 approval
- Opponent's one: 1 approval
→ tie → random selection → still 50% chance → mediator is selected → good.

But if you approve **both**, and opponent approves only one, that one has 2 approvals → wins.

So **approving both increases the chance that the mediator is selected**, and in any case, it's **guaranteed to be selected unless both approve nothing**.

But if you approve **both**, then **even if opponent approves nothing**, the mediator is selected.

So **you guarantee selection**.

If you approve only one, and opponent approves nothing, the mediator is still selected → same.

So actually, **as long as you approve at least one**, the mediator is selected **unless the opponent also approves nothing**, and even then, you have approval → so at least one has 1 approval → selected.

Wait — if you approve only one (say M1), and opponent approves nothing → M1 has 1 approval → wins.

If you approve **nothing**, and opponent approves nothing → no mediator → game back to base → (A1,A1) → you get 4.

So you **must** approve at least one to avoid that.

But since both mediators are identical, **you should approve both** to ensure that **if the opponent approves one**, the one they approve wins (or tie), but also to **avoid risk**.

But is there any reason not to approve both?

No — since they are identical and you gain no downside.

So **you should approve both**.

Moreover, by approving both, you **do not harm** your own chance — in fact, you **increase the robustness**.

Even if the opponent is strategic and wants to pick a different mediator, since both are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But suppose the opponent approves only one, and you approve both — then the one they approved gets 2 approvals → wins → you get the mediator.

So you are safe.

If you approve only one, and they approve the other, then it’s a tie → random → you get 50% chance — but still acceptable.

But approving both **maximizes the chance that your preferred mediator wins** — but since they are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But the **only real constraint** is to **ensure the mediator is selected**.

By approving **both**, you **guarantee** that a mediator (in fact, one of them) wins — and since both work the same, you are safe.

Even if you approve only one, it’s still guaranteed to win as long as you or the opponent approve it — but if you approve only one, and opponent approves nothing, it still wins.

But if you approve **nothing**, and opponent approves nothing → **no mediator** → you revert to base game → **you get only 4 points**.

So to avoid that, you must approve **at least one**.

But since both are identical, **approving both is safe and doesn't hurt**.

Therefore, you should approve **both**.

---

### **Final Step: Output**

Approve M1: true  
Approve M2: true

Because:
- Both mediators are identical in behavior.
- You must approve at least one to avoid reverting to the base game.
- Approving both is safe and ensures a mediator is selected regardless of opponent's actions.
- No downsides to approving both.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.


Instruction:
- Choose a probability distribution over the provided actions each round.
- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

Format requirement:
Return exactly one JSON object, for example:
{"A0": <INT>, "A1": <INT>, ...}

response:
Let's work through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without delegation)**

We are Player 2 in a simultaneous-move game with Player 1.

The payoff matrix (Player 2's payoff in each cell):

|          | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | 10    | 2     |
| **P2 A1** | 20    | 4     |

So Player 2's payoffs:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - vs P1 A0 → 10
  - vs P1 A1 → 2
- If P2 plays A1:
  - vs P1 A0 → 20
  - vs P1 A1 → 4

Player 1's payoffs (for reference but less relevant since we're Player 2):
- A0 vs A0 → 10
- A1 vs A0 → 0
- A0 vs A1 → 6
- A1 vs A1 → 4

This is a **non-zero-sum** game.

Let’s analyze the **pure strategy Nash equilibria** first.

Consider best responses:

#### **Player 2 best responses**
- If Player 1 plays A0 → P2 prefers A1 (20 > 10)
- If Player 1 plays A1 → P2 prefers A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2**.

#### **Player 1 best responses**
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A1 (6 > 10)? Wait: no:
  - P1 A0 vs P2 A0 → 10
  - P1 A1 vs P2 A0 → 0
  → So if P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A0

- If P2 plays A1 → P1 vs A1:
  - P1 A0 → 0
  - P1 A1 → 4
  → So prefers A1

So best response for P1:
- If P2 plays A0 → A0
- If P2 plays A1 → A1

So the **only pure equilibrium** is (A1, A1), yielding payoffs (4, 4).

But wait: if **P2 plays A1**, P1 plays A1 → this is stable.

But is P2 better off? If P2 plays A1 while P1 is at A0 → gets 20, so P2 would love that.

But P1 would never choose A0 if P2 plays A1. So if P2 plays A1, P1 responds with A1, so P2 only gets 4.

So even though A1 dominates, the outcome (A1, A1) gives P2 only 4.

But if P2 could **convince** P1 to play A0, P2 would get 20.

So we need a way to coordinate or influence P1.

---

### **Step 2: Introduce the new action: Delegate to Mediator (A2)**

Now Player 2 can choose to **delegate** to a mediator.

The mediator plays:
- A0 if **1 player** delegates to it
- A1 if **2 players** delegate to it

There are **two players** (Player 1 and Player 2), so delegation options:

- 0 players delegate → mediator doesn't act (but we’re assuming only if someone delegates)
- 1 player delegates → mediator plays A0
- 2 players delegate → mediator plays A1

So the **mediator's action is determined by the number of delegators**.

Now, **Player 2 has three choices**:
- A0: play A0 independently
- A1: play A1 independently
- A2: delegate to mediator

Same for Player 1 (they also have A0, A1, A2).

But we are only deciding **our own strategy**.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the strategic implications of delegation**

Let’s consider what happens based on **both players’ choices**.

Let’s denote:
- Our action: P2 chooses
- P1 chooses: either A0, A1, or A2

We must now model outcome for **every combination of actions**.

Let’s list all possible combinations and compute **our** payoff (**Player 2’s payoff**):

#### Case 1: P2 chooses A0 → we play A0
- P1 chooses A0: we play A0, P1 plays A0 → payoff: **10**
- P1 chooses A1: we play A0, P1 plays A1 → payoff: **2**
- P1 chooses A2: we play A0, P1 delegates → now **only 1 player delegated** → mediator plays A0 → so our action is A0 → outcome: A0 vs A1 (P1 plays A1) → so we get **2**

Wait: P1 delegates → mediator plays A0 (since only one delegator, so A0). So P1’s effective action is **A0**.

So when P1 delegates, they play A0.

Similarly, if both delegate: mediator plays A1.

Let’s clarify:

- If a player chooses A2 (delegate), then their **effective action is determined by mediator**, based on how many delegates.

So:
- If **1 delegate**: mediator plays A0
- If **2 delegates**: mediator plays A1

Thus, the **effective action** of a delegating player is:
- A0 if only one delegate
- A1 if two delegates

So now let’s re-analyze all cases for **Player 2**.

We need to compute **our payoff** in each of the 9 cases.

We'll make a payoff table for Player 2:

| P2 choice | P1 choice | # Delegates | Mediator action | P2’s effective action | P1’s effective action | P2 Payoff |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| A0       | A0        | 0           | —                | A0                     | A0                     | 10        |
| A0       | A1        | 0           | —                | A0                     | A1                     | 2         |
| A0       | A2        | 1 (P1)     | A0               | A0                     | A0                     | 10        |
| A1       | A0        | 0           | —                | A1                     | A0                     | 20        |
| A1       | A1        | 0           | —                | A1                     | A1                     | 4         |
| A1       | A2        | 1 (P1)     | A0               | A1                     | A0                     | 20        |
| A2       | A0        | 1 (P2)     | A0               | A0                     | A0                     | 10        |
| A2       | A1        | 1 (P2)     | A0               | A0                     | A1                     | 2         |
| A2       | A2        | 2          | A1               | A1                     | A1                     | 4         |

Let’s go through each:

- **P2: A0, P1: A0** → both play directly → A0 vs A0 → 10 ✅
- **P2: A0, P1: A1** → A0 vs A1 → 2 ✅
- **P2: A0, P1: A2** → P2 plays A0, P1 delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A0 → so P1 plays A0 → A0 vs A0 → 10 ✅
- **P2: A1, P1: A0** → A1 vs A0 → 20 ✅
- **P2: A1, P1: A1** → A1 vs A1 → 4 ✅
- **P2: A1, P1: A2** → P1 delegates, so 1 delegate → mediator plays A0 → P1 plays A0 → we play A1 → A1 vs A0 → 20 ✅
- **P2: A2, P1: A0** → we delegate, P1 plays A0 → 1 delegate → mediator plays A0 → so we play A0 → A0 vs A0 → 10 ✅
- **P2: A2, P1: A1** → we delegate, P1 plays A1 → 1 delegate → mediator plays A0 → so we play A0 → A0 vs A1 → 2 ✅
- **P2: A2, P1: A2** → both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A1 → both players play A1 → A1 vs A1 → 4 ✅

So the **Player 2 payoff matrix** is:

| P2\P1 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| A0    | 10 | 2  | 10 |
| A1    | 20 | 4  | 20 |
| A2    | 10 | 2  | 4  |

Now, we want to **maximize our expected payoff**, so we need to find a mixed strategy (probabilities over A0, A1, A2) that maximizes our expected payoff **regardless of P1’s strategy**, or assuming P1 is rational and we can anticipate.

But since we cannot control P1’s behavior, we assume **P1 is also optimizing**.

So we are looking for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

We want to **choose a mixed strategy** for ourselves such that we are indifferent between actions (if possible), or maximize our min expected payoff.

But ideally, we want to find **a symmetric or mutually reinforcing strategy**.

Let’s consider what happens if we **always** choose A1:

- If P1 plays A0 → we get 20
- If P1 plays A1 → we get 4
- If P1 plays A2 → we get 20

So we get 20 unless P1 plays A1.

But P1 might play A1 to force us to get 4.

But if P1 plays A1, then we get 4 — not good for us.

But if P1 plays A2, then we get 20 → good.

But P1 is also rational — what does P1 prefer?

Let’s analyze P1’s incentives.

We need to model P1’s payoff.

We’ll do a quick analysis of P1’s payoff matrix.

P1’s payoffs:

| P1\P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| A0    | 10 | 0  | 6  |
| A1    | 6  | 4  | 4  |
| A2    | 6  | 4  | 4  |

Explanation:

- P1 A0, P2 A0 → A0 vs A0 → P1 gets 10
- P1 A0, P2 A1 → A0 vs A1 → P1 gets 0
- P1 A0, P2 A2 → P2 delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A0 → so P2 plays A0 → A0 vs A0 → P1 gets 10 → but wait!

Hold on — mistake.

When P2 delegates, P2's effective action is determined by mediator: **1 delegate → A0**, so P2 plays A0.

So if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A2 (delegate), then:
- P1 plays A0
- P2 plays A0 (via mediator)
→ A0 vs A0 → P1 gets 10

Similarly:
- P1 A0, P2 A1 → A0 vs A1 → P1 gets 0
- P1 A0, P2 A2 → A0 vs A0 → P1 gets 10

Wait — that contradicts earlier.

Let me fix all P1 payoffs:

#### Correct P1 Payoff Matrix:

| P2\P1 | A0      | A1      | A2      |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| A0    | 10      | 2       | 10      |
| A1    | 0       | 4       | 4       |
| A2    | 6       | 4       | 4       |

No — P1’s payoff depends on **both players' effective actions**.

So let’s recompute **P1’s payoff** in each cell.

| P2 choice | P1 choice | Delegates | Mediator | P2 act | P1 act | P1 payoff |

| A0        | A0        | 0         | —        | A0     | A0     | 10        |
| A0        | A1        | 0         | —        | A0     | A1     | 6         |

| A1        | A0        | 0         | —        | A1     | A0     | 0         |
| A1        | A1        | 0         | —        | A1     | A1     | 4         |
| A1        | A2        | 1 (P1)   | A0       | A1     | A0     | 0         |
| A2        | A0        | 1 (P2)   | A0       | A0     | A0     | 10        |
| A2        | A1        | 1 (P2)   | A0       | A0     | A1     | 6         |
| A2        | A2        | 2         | A1       | A1     | A1     | 4         |

So **P1 payoff matrix**:

| P2\P1 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| A0    | 10 | 6  | 10 |
| A1    | 0  | 4  | 4  |
| A2    | 10 | 6  | 4  |

Now we can see:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 A0 → P1 gets 10
  - P2 A1 → P1 gets 0
  - P2 A2 → P1 gets 10
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 A0 → 6
  - P2 A1 → 4
  - P2 A2 → 6
- If P1 plays A2:
  - P2 A0 → 10
  - P2 A1 → 4
  - P2 A2 → 4

So P1’s best responses:

- If P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0 or A2 → both give 10, better than A1 (6)
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 prefers A0 (0), A1 (4), A2 (4) → so A1 or A2
- If P2 plays A2 → P1 prefers A0 (10), or A1,A2 (6,4) → so best is A0

Now back to **our goal**: maximize **our payoff** (P2).

We have:

Our payoff matrix:

| P2\P1 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| A0    | 10 | 2  | 10 |
| A1    | 20 | 4  | 20 |
| A2    | 10 | 2  | 4  |

We want to find a **mixed strategy** for P2 that **maximizes expected payoff**, assuming P1 is also choosing optimally.

Let’s suppose **we** use a mixed strategy:
- Play A0 with prob p
- Play A1 with prob q
- Play A2 with prob r
- p + q + r = 100

We will compute expected payoff **against** each of P1's pure strategies.

Let’s compute expected payoff for each P1 action:

- If P1 plays A0: our expected payoff = 10p + 20q + 10r
- If P1 plays A1: our expected payoff = 2p + 4q + 2r
- If P1 plays A2: our expected payoff = 10p + 20q + 4r

Now, P1 will choose a strategy to **minimize our payoff**, or maximize their own — so we need to assume they choose one of their best responses.

But to find a **Nash equilibrium**, we look for a mixed strategy where P2 is **indifferent** between the actions they play (if more than one), and P1 is also best-responding.

Let’s suppose we play **only A1 and A2** — skip A0.

Why? Because A0 gives only 10 at best, but A1 gives 20 when P1 plays A0 or A2.

But P1 will avoid A0 if they can.

Wait — can we make P1 **want** to play A0?

Alternatively, let’s suppose we try a strategy where **we delegate**, hoping that P1 will also delegate, so we both get A1 → 4 points.

But that’s bad for us.

Alternatively, if **only one person delegates**, mediator plays A0 — so we play A0.

So **if we delegate and P1 doesn’t**, we get A0, P1 plays A0 → we get 10

If we delegate and P1 **delegates**, we both play A1 → we get 4

So delegation is risky unless P1 also delegates (which we don’t want — we get only 4)

So perhaps **delegation is bad**?

But wait: if **P1 plays A1**, and we play A1 → we get 4

But if we **delegate**, and P1 plays A1 → only one delegate → mediator plays A0 → so we play A0, P1 plays A1 → we get 2

Worse!

But if P1 plays A0 → we get 10 → same as if we play A0 directly.

But if P1 plays A2 → then if we play A1 → we get 20; if we delegate → we get 10 (since only one delegate → A0)

So actually, **delegation is worse than playing A1** when P1 plays A2.

But when P1 plays A0, delegation and playing A0 both give 10.

So **A1 dominates A2 for us?** Let's check.

Compare A1 vs A2:
- Against P1 A0: A1 → 20, A2 → 10 → A1 better
- Against P1 A1: A1 → 4, A2 → 2 → A1 better
- Against P1 A2: A1 → 20, A2 → 4 → A1 better

So **A1 strictly dominates A2** for Player 2.

Now compare A0 and A1:
- A0 vs A0: 10 vs 20 → A1 better
- A0 vs A1: 2 vs 4 → A1 better
- A0 vs A2: 10 vs 4 → A0 better

So A1 doesn't dominate A0 — because against A2, A0 is better.

But since **A1 strictly dominates A2**, we should **never use A2** in any equilibrium.

So optimal strategy should only consider A0 and A1.

So we can reduce to:
- Choose A0 with p, A1 with (1-p)

Now, we must find p that maximizes our expected payoff, assuming P1 chooses optimally.

P1’s payoffs (from earlier):

| P2\P1 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| A0    | 10 | 6  | 10 |
| A1    | 0  | 4  | 4  |

Let P1 play A0 with prob x, A1 with y, A2 with z, x+y+z=1.

We want to find a **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose **P2 plays only A0 and A1**, so we don’t use A2.

Then, P2 plays A0 with p, A1 with 1-p.

Then P1’s best responses:

- If P1 plays A0: payoff = 10p + 0(1-p) = 10p
- If P1 plays A1: payoff = 6p + 4(1-p) = 6p + 4 - 4p = 2p + 4
- If P1 plays A2: payoff = 10p + 4(1-p) = 10p + 4 - 4p = 6p + 4

Now, compare:
- A0: 10p
- A1: 2p + 4
- A2: 6p + 4

P1 will choose the action with highest payoff.

We want a p such that **P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2** (both give same), and A1 is worse.

Because A2 is similar to A0 when P2 plays A0 or A1.

Note that when p is low, A0 gives less → P1 prefers A2.

When p is high, A0 gives more.

Let’s find when A0 = A2:
10p = 6p + 4 → 4p = 4 → p = 1

Then A0 = 10, A2 = 10 → same.

But at p=1 (P2 always A0), then:
- A0: 10
- A1: 2(1)+4 = 6
- A2: 10 → so A0 and A2 are tied.

But if P2 plays pure A0, P1 prefers A0 or A2 → both give 10.

But if P1 plays A0, then we get 10 (from A0 vs A0)

But if P1 plays A2, we get 10 (A0 vs A0)

So we get 10 either way.

But P1 could play A1, get 6 → worse.

So P1 will choose A0 or A2.

But if P2 always plays A0, and P1 plays A0 → we get 10.

But P1 could play A2 → same result.

But if P2 plays A0, and P1 plays A2 → P1 gets 10.

But if P1 plays A0, gets 10 too.

So both okay.

But if P1 plays A2, we get 10, same as A0.

So if we always play A0, we get 10.

But if we play A1, we can get 20.

So better to deviate.

Now, suppose P2 plays A1 with high probability.

Let’s suppose P2 plays A1 with p, and wants to make P1 **indifferent between A0 and A2**.

But P1 wants to avoid A1 if possible.

Wait — let’s suppose **P1 plays A0 with prob 1**.

Then our payoff: 10p + 20(1-p) = 20 - 10p

Max when p=0 → we play A1 → get 20.

But if P1 always plays A0, then we want to play A1 → get 20.

But if we play A1, P1 gets 0 → worse than 10 or 6.

So P1 will not play A0.

In fact, if P2 plays A1, P1 would prefer to play A1 or A2 → get 4 each.

So to get our payoff high, we want P1 to play A0 — but P1 won’t do that if we play A1.

So we need to make **P1 want to play A0**.

How?

P1 gets 10 from A0 only if we play A0.

But if we play A0, P1 gets:
- vs our A0 → 10
- vs our A1 → 0
- vs our A2 → 10

So if P2 plays **A0**, P1 gets 10 from A0 or A2.

But if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 0 from A0.

So P1 will play A0 only if they believe **P2 is likely to play A0**.

So perhaps a **mixed strategy** where we randomize, but **make P1 indifferent** between A0 and A2, and then choose A0.

But from earlier:

P1’s payoffs:
- A0: 10p
- A1: 2p + 4
- A2: 6p + 4

Set **A0 = A2**:
10p = 6p + 4 → 4p = 4 → p = 1 → P2 always A0

Then A0: 10, A2: 10 → tied.

But A1: 2(1)+4 = 6 → less.

So P1 would play A0 or A2.

If P1 plays A0 → we get 10
If P1 plays A2 → we get 10 (since P2 plays A0, P1 delegates → mediator A0 → we get A0 vs A0 → 10)

So we get 10.

But we could get more.

But if we play a mixed strategy, say p = 0.5.

Then:
- P1’s A0: 10*0.5 = 5
- A1: 2*0.5 + 4 = 5
- A2: 6*0.5 + 4 = 7

So P1 prefers A2 (7>5)

So P1 plays A2.

Then our payoff: when P1 plays A2, we get:
- A0: 10
- A1: 20
- A2: 4

So if P1 plays A2, we prefer A1.

But if we play A1, then P2 plays A1, P1 plays A2 → P1 gets 4 (from matrix)

But if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4 from A2.

If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10.

So if P2 plays A1 with high probability, P1 will not play A0.

But let’s suppose **we play A1 with probability 1**.

Then P1’s payoffs:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4
- A2: 4

So P1 plays A1 or A2 → get 4.

Then our payoff: if P1 plays A1 → we get 4; if A2 → we get 20.

But P1 gets 4 from both, so indifferent.

So P1 can choose A1 or A2.

If P1 chooses A1 → we get 4

If P1 chooses A2 → we get 20

So P1 could choose A1 to minimize our payoff.

So **P1 will choose A1**, so we get 4.

But we can get 20 if they choose A2.

So to maximize our chance, we want P1 to choose A2.

But P1 gets 4 either way, so they are indifferent.

But **P1 might be assumed to minimize our payoff**?

Or in Nash equilibrium, we assume both play best responses.

But if P2 plays A1, P1 is indifferent between A1 and A2.

So any mixture over A1 and A2 is a best response.

So P1 could play A2 with probability 1 → then we get 20.

But could P1 play only A1? Yes — also best response.

So outcome depends on P1’s choice.

But in a **unique equilibrium**, we need mutual best responses.

But here, there is no pure strategy equilibrium with P2 playing A1.

Let’s try to find a mixed strategy equilibrium.

Assume P2 plays A0 with p, A1 with 1-p.

P1 will play a strategy to maximize their payoff.

Let’s suppose P1 plays A0 with x, A2 with y, A1 with z, x+y+z=1.

But P1 has incentive to avoid A1 if possible.

Suppose P1 plays only A0 and A2.

Let’s set P1 indifferent between A0 and A2.

P1’s payoff:
- A0: 10p
- A2: 6p + 4

Set equal: 10p = 6p + 4 → 4p = 4 → p=1

Then P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2.

At p=1, A0 and A2 both give 10.

But A1 gives 6 → less.

So P1 plays A0 and/or A2.

Now, if P2 is playing A0 with probability 1, then if P1 plays A0 → we get 10
If P1 plays A2 → we get 10

So we get 10.

But can we do better?

What if we play a mixed strategy that makes P1 **indifferent between A0 and A2**, and also makes it unattractive for P1 to play A1?

But from above, only at p=1 is A0 = A2.

Otherwise:
- If p < 1, then 6p + 4 > 10p → so P1 prefers A2

For example, p=0.5: A0:5, A2:7 → so A2 better

So P1 will play A2.

Then our payoff when P1 plays A2: 
- If we play A0: 10
- A1: 20
- A2: 4

So we prefer A1.

So if P1 plays A2, we should play A1.

But if we play A1, then P1's payoff from A2 is 4, from A0 is 0, from A1 is 4.

So P1 is indifferent between A1 and A2, but will not play A0.

So P1 will play A1 or A2.

So to maximize our payoff, we want P1 to play A2.

But P1 can play A1.

But there's a way: **make P1 play A2 with high probability**.

But in equilibrium, we need mutual best response.

Let’s try this: suppose P2 plays A1 with probability 1.

Then P1's best response: A1 or A2 (both give 4), avoid A0 (0).

Suppose P1 plays A2 with probability 1.

Then we get 20.

Is this a Nash equilibrium? Let’s check.

- P2 plays A1: best response? If P1 plays A2, then we get 20 from A1, 10 from A0, 4 from A2 → so A1 is best.

- P1 plays A2: best response? If P2 plays A1, then P1 gets 4 from A2, 4 from A1, 0 from A0 → so A2 is best (since not worse).

So **(A1, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**.

Payoff: we get 20.

Similarly, (A1, A1) is also an equilibrium: P1 gets 4 from A1, and P2 gets 4.

But in that case, we get only 4.

So we prefer the one where P1 plays A2.

But is (A1, A2) an equilibrium?

Yes: 
- If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4 from A1, 4 from A2, 0 from A0 → so A1 and A2 are both best responses.
- If P1 plays A2, P2 gets 20 from A1, 10 from A0, 4 from A2 → so A1 is best.

So yes, (A1, A2) is a Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, (A1, A1) is also.

But we can get 20 in (A1, A2), but only 4 in (A1, A1).

So if we can **influence P1 to play A2**, we get 20.

But can we guarantee that?

In a mixed strategy equilibrium, we can choose a strategy that makes P1 indifferent between A1 and A2, but we still need to maximize our payoff.

But since there is a pure strategy equilibrium where we get 20, and we are the only one choosing, we can commit to A1.

But the game is simultaneous — we can't commit.

But in mixed strategies, we can choose a strategy.

But since there is a pure strategy equilibrium with high payoff (20), and it's stable (A1 for us, A2 for P1), and we are maximizing, we can **consider playing A1 with high probability** to signal, but in equilibrium, we can assume that.

But to maximize guaranteed payoff, perhaps we should play a mixed strategy.

But since (A1, A2) is an equilibrium, and we get 20, which is the maximum possible, we should play A1.

But is there a risk? Only if P1 plays A1, we get 4.

But if P1 plays A1, we get 4, but if we deviate to A0, we get 2 (worse).

So no incentive to deviate.

But to increase our payoff, we need P1 to play A2.

But P1 will only play A2 if they prefer it.

But in equilibrium, they are indifferent.

So we cannot force them to play A2.

But if we play A1, P1 is willing to play A2.

So in the equilibrium where P2 plays A1, P1 plays A2, we get 20.

Similarly, if P1 plays A1, we get 4.

But P1 will not play A0, since it gives 0.

So P1 is between A1 and A2.

But if P1 plays A2, we get 20.

So why wouldn't P1 play A1?

Because they are indifferent.

So we should assume that P1 might play A2.

But to be safe, we could play a mixed strategy that makes P1 play A2.

But the only way to force high payoff is to play A1, and hope P1 plays A2.

But in game theory, if both players are rational, and we play A1, P1 will play A2 (or A1), but we have no way to ensure A2.

However, in the absence of better options, and since we want to maximize expected payoff, and since playing A1 gives us **20 if P1 plays A2, 4 if P1 plays A1**, and P1 gets 4 either way, they might play A2 to avoid giving us more? But no, they are indifferent.

So in the worst case, P1 plays A1, we get 4.

But in best case, P1 plays A2, we get 20.

But if we want to maximize **expected payoff under best response**, we can assume P1 plays A2, and we get 20.

But to be robust, let's use the fact that **A1 is dominant in some sense**.

But recall: **A1 strictly dominates A2**, so we should never use A2.

And A1 is better than A0 unless P1 plays A2.

But P1 only plays A2 if they are indifferent.

But since A2 gives them 4, same as A1, they might randomize.

So to maximize our expected payoff, assuming P1 plays A2 (which is a best response), we should play A1.

And since in the equilibrium (A1, A2) we get 20, which is the highest possible, and it's an equilibrium, we should play A1.

But the game allows us to choose mixed strategy.

But to get 20, we need P1 to play A2.

But P1 can also play A1.

So expected payoff if we play A1 and P1 plays A2 with prob q, A1 with 1-q: 20q + 4(1-q) = 4 + 16q

Max at q=1 → 20.

But if we could make P1 play A2, we'd get 20.

But we can't force it.

But in the mixed strategy equilibrium, suppose we play A1 with probability 1.

Then P1 is indifferent between A1 and A2.

So any mixture is best response.

So P1 can play A2 with probability 1.

So in that case, we get 20.

And it's a valid equilibrium.

So the optimal strategy for us is to play A1 with probability 1.

But is there a mixed strategy that gives us higher than 20? No, impossible.

So playing A1 with 100% is best.

Moreover, since A2 is strictly dominated, and A0 is worse than A1 when P1 plays A1 or A2, we should not use A0.

So final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 100, "A2": 0}

Wait — but let's double-check if there's a better mixed strategy.

Suppose we play a mixed strategy between A0 and A1.

But if we play A0 with positive probability, then if P1 plays A0, we get 10, but if P1 plays A1, we get 2, which is worse.

And if P1 plays A2, we get 10.

But P1 will not play A0 if we play A1 likely.

And since A1 gives us 20 against A2, which is better than 10, we should play A1.

No incentive to use A0.

So the best is to play A1 only.

Final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 100, "A2": 0}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let’s break this down step by step to determine which mediators you should approve as **Player 1**, with the goal of **maximizing your own expected points**.

---

### 🔷 Step 1: Understand the Base Game without Mediators

We are Player 1. The payoff matrix (from **your** perspective) is:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 (Other) | A1 (Other) |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | 10         | 0          |
| **A1**                        | 6          | 4          |

This is a classic 2-player simultaneous-move game. Without delegation, you’d consider strategies based on mixed or pure strategies, but now we have a **delegation mechanism** and a **mediator selection via approval voting**.

---

### 🔷 Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism & Mediator Rules

You can **delegate** your move to one of the mediators (M1 or M2). But **both mediators must be approved by players**, and then the one with **most approvals** wins — and if tied, it's chosen uniformly at random.

So even if you like a mediator, if it doesn’t get enough approvals, it won’t be active.

You’re deciding whether to **approve** each mediator: `true` or `false`.

But note: You don't decide *which* mediator will be selected; that depends on **approval counts** from both players. Only after that, if a mediator is selected, it will **automatically play** based on how many people (including you) delegated to it.

---

### 🔷 Step 3: Analyze Each Mediator’s Behavior

#### ✅ Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):
- If **1 player** delegates → plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → plays **A0**

#### ✅ Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):
- If **1 player** delegates → plays **A0**
- If **2 players** delegate → plays **A1**

Note: These mediators behave differently depending on **how many persons** use them.

Let’s denote:
- You are Player 1.
- The other player is Player 2.
- We don’t know what Player 2 will do yet — but we’ll analyze based on possible outcomes.

---

### 🔷 Step 4: Think from Your Perspective — What Do You Want?

You want to **maximize your own expected points**, considering:
- Whether to delegate or not
- Which mediator gets activated (based on approval votes)
- How many people (you + other player) end up delegating to the winner

But since you're choosing **approval** *before* anything else, and you can only approve/denounce mediators, your strategy must account for the potential outcomes under different combinations.

Let’s go through possibilities.

---

### 🔷 Step 5: Evaluate Expected Payoffs Under Each Mediator

Let’s suppose **M1** becomes the winning mediator (i.e., has the most approvals — assume it does).

Then its actions depend on total delegation:

#### Case A: M1 wins → you decide whether to delegate

##### Subcase A1: You **do not delegate** → only Player 2 may delegate

- Then only 0 or 1 player delegates → so **1 player delegates if Player 2 delegates**, otherwise 0
- But if only 1 person delegates → M1 plays **A1**
- So if Player 2 delegates → M1 plays A1 → you get to pick your action freely!
    - Wait: no! If you **don’t delegate**, you choose **your own action** independently.

    So:
    - You choose an action (A0 or A1)
    - M1 plays **A1** (since only one delegate → A1)
    - Then the outcome depends on your choice vs. M1's choice (which is A1)

    So:
    - If you pick A0: (A0, A1) → you get **0**
    - If you pick A1: (A1, A1) → you get **4**

    Best in that subcase: you pick A1 → get 4

    If Player 2 delegates but you don't → you get **at least 4**, best case.

But wait — what if **neither** delegates?
→ No one uses mediator → you both choose actions independently → same as base game.

But here’s the key: **If the mediator is active, they act only when someone delegates**.

So the **mediator only makes decisions when at least one person delegates to it**.

And **if no one delegates**, then all players play independently (no mediator involved).

So the mediator only comes into play if **at least one person** uses it.

Now back to evaluating cases.

We are trying to figure out which mediator maximizes **your expected payoff**, given your ability to **approve**.

But because of the approval phase, and because the outcome depends on what **both** players do, we need to reason about **stable equilibria** or **best responses**.

But remember: You are making decisions before any other moves. So let’s simulate **what happens if you approve each mediator**.

---

### 🔷 Step 6: Consider Approval Strategy — Why Approve or Not?

The **winning mediator** is selected from those with **maximum number of approvals**.

Assume:
- You can approve M1, M2, both, or neither.
- Then players vote on approval → then winner is chosen randomly among tied max-approved mediators.

Since **only one** mediator can be active, and it behaves differently depending on how many use it, you want to **choose approving mediators that lead to favorable outcomes in likely scenarios**.

Importantly: **You don't control whether others approve** — but you can try to shape the outcome.

Let’s think about each possible scenario **depending on who the winning mediator is**.

---

### 🔷 Step 7: Hypothesize Likely Outcomes Based on Approval Decisions

Let’s suppose you approve only **M1**.

Suppose Player 2 also approves M1 → then M1 has 2 approvals → wins.

Possibility: M1 is active.

Now what happens?

- Who delegates? You and/or Player 2.

But remember: **Delegation is optional**. After the mediator is selected, both players decide whether to delegate.

So the sequence is:
1. You and Player 2 vote "approve" or "not approve" for each mediator.
2. Winner is the mediator with highest approval count (random tiebreak).
3. Then, once winner is known, **both players independently decide** whether to delegate or not.

So the final decision of delegation is made **after** knowing which mediator is active.

Therefore, **you can condition your delegation decision on which mediator is chosen**.

This is critical.

So, given a mediator, you can say: “If this mediator is active, I will delegate” or “I will not”.

Your goal: Maximize your expected payoff across all scenarios.

So now, let’s evaluate:

---

## 🔶 Evaluate: What should you do if M1 is active?

From earlier:
- If **1 player** delegates → M1 plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → M1 plays A0

Suppose M1 is active.

You can choose to delegate or not.

Player 2 can also choose.

So four possible combinations of delegation choices:

| You delegate? | Player 2 delegate? | Delegates → # of delegates | M1 plays | Your action? | Your payoff |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| No            | No                | 0 → no delegation → no mediator | irrelevant | You choose | Base game |
| Yes           | No                | 1 → M1 plays A1 | A1 | You don’t play → M1 plays for you | Your action = A1 → you get payoffs vs. Player 2's action |
| No            | Yes               | 1 → M1 plays A1 | A1 | You choose | You vs A1 |
| Yes           | Yes               | 2 → M1 plays A0 | A0 | You don’t play → M1 plays A0 | You get payoff vs. Player 2’s action |

Let’s compute your payoff in each:

---

### 🔹 Case 1: Neither delegates → Full independence

You and Player 2 choose actions independently.

You have to consider their likely strategies based on incentives.

But you can assume both players act rationally.

In the base game (no delegation), we can find Nash equilibrium.

Let’s briefly compute that.

Let p = probability you play A0  
q = probability Player 2 plays A0

Your expected payoff:

E[you] = p*q*10 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*6 + (1-p)*(1-q)*4  
= 10pq + 6(1-p)q + 4(1-p)(1-q)

Simplify:
= 10pq + 6q - 6pq + 4(1 - p - q + pq)
= (10pq - 6pq) + 6q + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq  
= 4pq + 2q + 4 - 4p

To maximize E[you], take derivative w.r.t. p:

∂/∂p = 4q - 4 → set to zero → q = 1

Wait — better to find mutual best response.

Let’s solve for Nash equilibrium.

Let’s set up Player 2’s best response first.

Player 2 wants to maximize their own payoff:

Payoff to Player 2:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 20
- (A1, A0): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

So let’s find mixed NE.

Let p = P(you play A0)  
q = P(Player 2 plays A0)

For Player 2: indifferent between A0 and A1 iff:

E[A0] = E[A1]

E[A0] = q*10 + (1-q)*2 = 10q + 2 - 2q = 8q + 2  
E[A1] = q*20 + (1-q)*4 = 20q + 4 - 4q = 16q + 4

Set equal:

8q + 2 = 16q + 4  
-8q = 2 → q = -0.25 → impossible

So Player 2 **never** mixes. Because E[A0] < E[A1] for all q ≥ 0?

Check at q=0: E[A0]=2, E[A1]=4 → A1 better  
At q=1: E[A0]=10, E[A1]=20 → A1 better

So regardless of your strategy, Player 2 always prefers A1.

So Player 2 will play A1 with probability 1.

Then what do you do?

If Player 2 plays A1:
- You get 0 if you play A0
- You get 4 if you play A1

So you prefer A1 → play A1 with probability 1

Thus **unique Nash equilibrium**: both play A1 → you get 4.

But let’s confirm:

- If you play A1, Player 2 plays A1 → payoff 4 each → no incentive to deviate.

Yes, this is a strict NE.

Even though A0 vs A0 gives 10, you can’t coordinate — and A1 dominates A0 for Player 2, and A1 dominates A0 for you when opponent plays A1.

So in absence of delegation or mediation, **both will play A1** → you get **4**.

But that’s only if **no delegation** occurs.

---

Back to M1 being active.

### ✅ Scenario: M1 is active

Now, players can choose to delegate.

After M1 is selected, we see how many delegate → affects what M1 plays.

Now, you and Player 2 can **strategically choose** to delegate or not.

Let’s simulate **rational behavior** assuming both players want to maximize their own payoff.

#### Let’s suppose M1 is the mediator.

Recall:
- 1 delegate → M1 plays A1
- 2 delegates → M1 plays A0

Now, your goal: maximize your own expected payout.

Try to find **Nash equilibrium in the delegation stage**.

Let’s suppose both players consider whether to delegate.

Let’s explore possible stable delegation patterns.

---

### 🟨 Case A: Both players delegate

Then: 2 delegates → M1 plays A0  
So you are playing A0 (because M1 plays A0 for you)  
Player 2 is playing A0 (same)

So result: (A0, A0) → you get **10 points**

That’s great for you.

But is it stable?

Suppose you unilaterally deviate: stop delegating.

Now: only 1 delegate → M1 plays A1

You choose your action → you can pick A0 or A1.

Player 2 is still delegating → M1 plays A1 for them → so Player 2 plays A1.

You play either A0 or A1.

- If you play A0: (A0, A1) → you get 0
- If you play A1: (A1, A1) → you get 4

Best: play A1 → get 4

But previously, you got 10. So you lose → so you won’t unilaterally deviate.

But what if Player 2 considers deviating?

Suppose you keep delegating, Player 2 stops.

Then 1 delegate → M1 plays A1

You play A1 (since you delegated) → you get A1 vs Player 2’s choice

Player 2 can choose to play A0 or A1.

- If Player 2 plays A0: (A1, A0) → you get 6
- If Player 2 plays A1: (A1, A1) → you get 4

So Player 2 would prefer to play A0? But Player 2's payoff:
- (A1, A0): 2
- (A1, A1): 4 → so better to play A1.

So Player 2 plays A1.

Then you get: (A1, A1) → you get 4

Previously in mutual delegation: you got 10 → now 4 → worse.

So Player 2 has incentive to defect → so mutual delegation is **not stable**.

Therefore, even if both initially agree to delegate, **each has incentive to deviate**.

So mutual delegation breaks down.

---

What about **no one delegates**?

Then full independence → we said both will play A1 → you get 4.

But if you unilaterally delegate, while Player 2 does NOT delegate:

- 1 delegate → M1 plays A1
- You are delegating → so M1 plays A1 for you → you play A1
- Player 2 chooses action (not delegating)

Now, Player 2 knows you are playing A1.

They get:
- Play A0: payoff 2
- Play A1: payoff 4 → so they play A1

Result: (A1, A1) → you get 4 → same as no delegation.

No gain.

But if instead, you delegate but Player 2 **does** delegate → then both delegate → M1 plays A0 → you play A0

But Player 2 gets A0 too.

Then you get 10 → great!

But as shown, Player 2 has no incentive to do that — because if you delegate, and they don’t, then Player 2 can play A1 (which gives them 4), but if they delegate, they get A0 → only 2? Wait:

Hold on — in the case where Player 2 delegates, M1 plays **A0** → so Player 2 gets A0.

Then if you play A1, result: (A1, A0) → you get 6 → good for you

But Player 2: gets 2 — worse than playing A1 and getting 4.

So Player 2 has **strong incentive not to delegate** if you do.

Hence: **Delegating is bad for Player 2 if you delegate**.

So Player 2 will only delegate if they expect you to also delegate — but that requires coordination, which is unstable.

Therefore, **the only stable outcome** when M1 is active is:

- Nobody delegates → independent play → both play A1 → you get 4

Or:
- You delegate, Player 2 does not → result: M1 plays A1 → you play A1 → Player 2 plays A1 → you get 4

Same.

Can anyone do better?

Suppose you **do not delegate**, and Player 2 delegates.

Then: 1 delegate → M1 plays A1 → Player 2 plays A1

You choose → play A1 → get 4

Same.

So in **all cases** when M1 is active, you end up getting **no more than 4**, unless both cooperate to delegate → but that’s unstable.

And you risk getting 0 or 6, depending on others, but cannot enforce cooperation.

So **best you can guarantee** with M1 is 4, possibly less.

---

### ✅ Now check M2: Proposed by Player 2

M2 rules:
- 1 delegate → plays A0
- 2 delegates → plays A1

Now suppose M2 is active.

Again, 4 cases.

#### Case: You and Player 2 both delegate → 2 delegates → M2 plays A1 → you play A1

Result: (A1, A1) → you get 4

Not great.

But if **only you delegate** → 1 delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0

Player 2 chooses freely.

Player 2 wants to maximize their payoff.

They know you are playing A0.

So their payoff:
- Play A0: 10 (since (A0, A0))
- Play A1: 20 (since (A0, A1)) → much better

So Player 2 will play A1 → (A0, A1) → you get **0**

Very bad for you.

Similarly, if **only Player 2 delegates**, M2 plays A0 → Player 2 plays A0

You choose.

You know Player 2 plays A0.

Your payoff:
- Play A0: 10
- Play A1: 6 → so you play A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10

So: if **you don’t delegate**, and Player 2 delegates → you get **10**

But can Player 2 benefit? Let’s check.

If Player 2 delegates → M2 plays A0 → they play A0

You play A0 → they get 10

If they don’t delegate → you might play A1 → then (A1, A0) → they get 2 → worse

So if you play A0 (which you do), Player 2 is better off delegating to play A0.

But if you don’t delegate, and you’re going to play A0 anyway, then Player 2 gets 10 if they delegate, and 2 if they don’t → so they want to delegate.

So in that case, Player 2 will delegate.

So if **you don’t delegate**, and **Player 2 delegates** → M2 plays A0 → Player 2 plays A0 → you play A0 → (A0, A0) → you get **10**

Now, can you get this outcome?

Yes — if you **don’t delegate**, and Player 2 **delegates** → you both want that.

But if you delegate, Player 2 will not want to delegate (as above, would get only 2), so they won’t.

Therefore, **stable outcome** when M2 is active:

- You do **not delegate** → you choose A0
- Player 2 **delegates** → M2 plays A0 → they play A0
→ Result: (A0, A0) → you get **10**

This is very good for you.

And it’s stable:
- You: if you deviate and delegate → then 1 delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0 → Player 2 still plays A0? No — if you delegate, does Player 2 still delegate?

If you delegate → now both delegate → 2 delegates → M2 plays A1

So you play A1 → Player 2 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4 → worse than 10 → so you don’t want to delegate.

Player 2: if they deviate and stop delegating → then only you delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0 → Player 2 chooses → they can play A1 → get 20 → better? Wait.

Wait: if you delegate, and Player 2 does **not**, then:
- 1 delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0
- Player 2 chooses → sees (A0, A0) → but Player 2 can play A1 → get 20
- Result: (A0, A1) → you get 0 → worse for you, but **good for Player 2**

Ah! So if Player 2 **stops delegating**, they can get **20** instead of **10**.

So Player 2 has strong incentive **not to delegate**.

But that breaks the cooperation.

So if you **don’t delegate**, and Player 2 **delegates**, you get 10.

But if Player 2 realizes that if they stop delegating, they can get 20, they **won’t delegate**, even though you'd prefer they do.

So this outcome is **unstable**.

Unless… you can commit not to delegate.

But Player 2 will play their best response.

So if you don’t delegate, Player 2 observes that if they delegate → they get 10
If they don’t delegate → they can play A1 → get 20

So **they will not delegate**.

Then no one delegates → independent play → both play A1 → you get 4

So again, you get only 4.

Worse.

Alternatively, if you **do not delegate**, and Player 2 **does not delegate** → independent → both play A1 → you get 4

If you **do delegate**, and Player 2 doesn’t → M2 plays A0 for you → you play A0 → Player 2 plays A1 (best for them) → you get 0 → bad

If you delegate, and Player 2 delegates → both play A1 → you get 4

So no matter what, you cannot get more than 4 with M2?

But earlier thought: if only Player 2 delegates → you get 10 — but only if they **cooperate** — which they won’t, because they can get 20 by not delegating.

So **Player 2 will never delegate**, because delegating ties them to A0, which harms them.

So in practice, **with M2 active**:
- Player 2 will **never delegate** (because if they delegate, they play A0, and if they don’t, they can play A1 and get higher payoff)
- So only possible delegation: you delegate or nobody

If you delegate → then only you delegate → M2 plays A0 → you play A0
Player 2 plays A1 (best response) → you get 0

If you don’t delegate → no delegation → both play A1 → you get 4

So **best you can get with M2 is 4**

Same as base game.

But earlier with M1 active, you could also get 4.

So **M1 seems similar to M2**?

Wait — recall: **with M1**, if you **both delegate**, M1 plays A0 → you get A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10

But that requires **mutual delegation** → and each has incentive to defect:

- If you defect: then only Player 2 delegates → M1 plays A1 → Player 2 plays A1 → you play A1 (if you don’t delegate) → (A1, A1) → you get 4 — worse than 10?
Wait no: 4 > 0? Wait — 4 is less than 10.

Wait — if you **defect**, you go from 10 to 4 — so you actually **lose** by defecting.

Similarly, Player 2: if they defect, same thing.

So mutual delegation yields **10 each**.

If one defects: the defector gets 4, the other gets 0.

So if you both defect: you get 4.

So both want to **cooperate** in mutual delegation — because 10 > 4.

But is it stable?

Suppose you both agreed to delegate.

If you deviate: you get **4**, while other gets 0

So you gain from defecting? 4 > 0 → yes! You’re better off defecting.

Wait — no: if both delegate → you get 10

You defect: now only one delegate → M1 plays A1 → you play A1 → Player 2 plays A1 → you get 4

So you go from 10 to 4 → **worse**

So **you do not want to defect**.

Similarly, Player 2: if they defect, they go from 10 to 4 → worse

So **mutual delegation IS stable!**

Because unilateral deviation reduces your payoff.

It’s like a prisoners’ dilemma? No — here, defecting gives you **less**.

So mutual delegation is **Pareto optimal and stable**.

So if M1 is active, there exists a **stable equilibrium** in which **both delegate**, resulting in:
- M1 plays A0 (since 2 delegates)
- You play A0
- Player 2 plays A0
- You get **10**

Perfect!

Now, for M2:

- Mutual delegation: M2 plays A1 → both play A1 → you get 4
- You defect → you play A1, Player 2 still delegates → M2 plays A0 → Player 2 plays A0 → you play A1 → (A1, A0) → you get 6 → better than 4
- So you **want to defect**
- Similarly, Player 2: if you don’t delegate, they can play A1 → get 20 → but if they delegate, they get 4 → so they don’t want to delegate

So mutual delegation is **not stable** under M2 — because each wants to avoid it.

Only stable point is **no delegation** → both play A1 → you get 4

So **only M1 offers a chance for both players to coordinate on high payoff (10)**

Therefore, **if M1 is active**, you can achieve **10** in a stable way.

With M2, you cannot — you get at most 4.

So **you want M1 to win**.

---

### 🔷 Final Step: Approval Choice

You can **approve M1**, **M2**, both, or neither.

But **M1 is proposed by you** — probably you are pro-M1.

You want **M1 to win** — because only then can you reach the 10-point outcome.

But can you **force** M1 to win?

Only if you approve it, and if Player 2 doesn’t approve a stronger alternative.

But M2 is not better for you.

Suppose you **do not approve M1**, and approve M2 → then M2 might win.

But M2 gives you only 4 at best.

You prefer 10.

So you **must approve M1**

Now, what about M2?

If you approve M2, and Player 2 also approves M2, then M2 might win.

But M2 is worse for you.

But also: you don't want to help M2 win.

In fact, if you approve M1 and M2, and Player 2 approves M1, then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 — M1 wins.

If you approve M1, and Player 2 approves M2 — then both have 1 approval — winner chosen at random.

50% chance M1 wins → you get 10 in that case (on average, conditional on M1 win)

50% chance M2 wins → you get 4

Expected payoff: 0.5 * 10 + 0.5 * 4 = 7

But if you **do not approve M2**, and approve only M1 → then:
- If Player 2 approves M1 → M1 wins → you get 10
- If Player 2 approves M2 → M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → random → 50% chance of M1 win → same as above → expected 7

Wait — same expected value?

But if you approve M2, and Player 2 approves M2 → M2 wins → you get 4 → worst.

So by **approving M2**, you make it **more likely** that M2 wins — which is worse for you.

Therefore, **you should only approve M1**, and **not approve M2**.

Why?

- If you approve M2, you increase the chance M2 wins
- M2 is bad for you
- Even if M2 wins, you get only 4
- M1 wins → you get 10

So **approve M1, disapprove M2**

This minimizes risk and maximizes chance of success.

Also, if Player 2 is rational, they may prefer M1 too — because M1 allows both to get 10, while M2 leads to 4 or 0.

So if Player 2 is rational, they may approve M1.

Thus, M1 likely wins.

Therefore, **your best move is to approve only M1**.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

===== Response [ID: 59ebd045] [2026-01-24 03:12:04] =====
agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the basic game without a mediator

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Player 2  A0    10      2
          A1    20      4
```

Let me find my optimal strategy:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0 → **A1 is better**
- If P1 plays A1: I get 4 from A1 vs 2 from A0 → **A1 is better**

So **A1 is my dominant strategy**.

For Player 1:
- If I play A0: P1 gets 10 from A0 vs 6 from A1 → P1 prefers A0
- If I play A1: P1 gets 4 from A1 vs 0 from A0 → P1 prefers A1

Since I'll play A1 (dominant), P1's best response is A1.
**Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze the proposed mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 3: Analyze the delegation game with mediator

If a mediator exists, I must decide whether to delegate:

**Outcomes:**
- Both delegate → Mediator plays A0 for both → **(A0, A0) → I get 10**
- Only I delegate → Mediator plays A1 for me, P1 best responds with A1 → I get 4
- Only P1 delegates → Mediator plays A1 for P1, I best respond with A1 → I get 4  
- Neither delegates → Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → I get 4

**Delegation game payoffs for me:**
```
                P1 delegates    P1 doesn't
I delegate      10              4
I don't         4               4
```

**Analysis:** Delegating is weakly dominant for me (10 > 4 if P1 delegates, 4 = 4 otherwise).

Similarly, delegation is weakly dominant for P1.

**Result:** With the mediator, both players will delegate in equilibrium → **I get 10 instead of 4!**

## Step 4: Decision

Since both mediators are identical and both enable a better outcome for me (10 vs 4), I should approve both to maximize the chance that a mediator is selected.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the game without delegation (baseline)**

We are Player 2. The payoff matrix (from Player 2’s perspective) is as follows:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 (Player 1) | A1 (Player 1) |
|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**                        | 10            | 2             |
| **A1**                        | 20            | 4             |

But remember: we are **Player 2**, so:
- When you pick A0 and opponent picks A0: you get 10
- When you pick A1 and opponent picks A0: you get 20
- When you pick A0 and opponent picks A1: you get 2
- When you pick A1 and opponent picks A1: you get 4

Player 1’s payoffs (for reference, though we care only about our own):
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

So Player 1 has an incentive to play A0, since:
- If you play A0, they get 10 vs 6 → prefer A0
- If you play A1, they get 0 vs 4 → prefer A1
But they don’t directly control our choice.

---

### **Step 2: Introduce the new action A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**

Now you can choose:
- A0: act independently, choose A0 with probability 1
- A1: act independently, choose A1 with probability 1
- A2: delegate to the mediator

The mediator:
- If **1 player** delegates → it plays A0
- If **2 players** delegate → it plays A1

Note: You are Player 2. The other player (Player 1) also has the same options: A0, A1, A2.

So the outcome depends on **how many players delegate**.

We must consider all **combinations of choices** between the two players.

Let’s define:
- Your strategy: choose probabilities over {A0, A1, A2}
- Opponent’s strategy: unknown, but we assume rational behavior (could be mixed strategy) — we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** or **best response**.

But since you're trying to **maximize your expected payoff**, and the opponent is also rational, we need to find a **mutual best response**.

Let’s consider the possibilities.

---

### **Step 3: Enumerate all possible combinations and their outcomes**

Let’s consider all 9 combinations of actions by Player 1 and Player 2:

| P1 Choice | P2 Choice | # Delegates | Mediator Plays | Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Payoff | Opponent's Payoff |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0       | A0        | 0           | —              | A0          | A0                | 10          | 10                |
| A0       | A1        | 0           | —              | A1          | A0                | 20          | 0                 |
| A0       | A2        | 1           | A0             | A0 (via med) | A0                | 10          | 10                |
| A1       | A0        | 0           | —              | A0          | A1                | 2           | 6                 |
| A1       | A1        | 0           | —              | A1          | A1                | 4           | 4                 |
| A1       | A2        | 1           | A0             | A0 (via med) | A1                | 2           | 6                 |
| A2       | A0        | 1           | A0             | A0 (via med) | A0                | 10          | 10                |
| A2       | A1        | 1           | A0             | A1 (via med) | A1                | 4           | 4                 |
| A2       | A2        | 2           | A1             | A1 (via med) | A1                | 4           | 4                 |

Let’s verify:
- If only one delegate (either Player 1 or Player 2), mediator plays A0
- If both delegate, mediator plays A1

So in the case:
- P1: A2, P2: A0 → only P1 delegates → med plays A0
- P1: A2, P2: A1 → only P1 delegates → med plays A0
- P1: A0, P2: A2 → only P2 delegates → med plays A0
- P1: A1, P2: A2 → only P2 delegates → med plays A0
- P1: A2, P2: A2 → both delegate → med plays A1

Thus, your action in case of delegation is **determined by the mediator**.

Now, let's compute **your expected payoff** under different joint strategies.

---

### **Step 4: Consider strategic implications**

Suppose we **both** decide to delegate: outcome is both A1 → you get 4.

If **only one** delegates: mediator plays A0 → so you get 10 if you’re the one who acts with A0, or 2 if your opponent is using A1.

Now consider what incentives exist.

Let’s assume **both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff**.

Let’s try to find a **symmetric equilibrium**, since the game is symmetric in structure (other than labeling).

Let’s suppose that in equilibrium, both players use the same mixed strategy:  
Let:
- $ p $ = probability of choosing A0  
- $ q $ = probability of choosing A1  
- $ r $ = probability of choosing A2  
with $ p + q + r = 1 $

We aim to find $ p, q, r $ such that no player can gain by changing strategy.

Instead, try to **guess the equilibrium**.

---

### **Try: Both players choose A2 (delegate) w.p. 1**

Then: both delegate → mediator plays A1 → both get 4.

Could a player deviate?

Suppose Player 2 deviates to A1 instead of A2.

Then:
- P1: A2 → delegates
- P2: A1 → acts independently

Only one delegate → mediator plays A0 → so P2's action is **A0** (via mediator) → so P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1 → your payoff is 2

But if you had stayed with A2, you get 4.

So deviating gives you **2 < 4** → not better → no incentive.

What if you deviate to A0?

Then P1: A2 → delegates → mediator plays A0 → so P1 plays A0  
P2: A0 → plays A0 → you both play A0 → you get 10

But wait — P2 is playing A0 (independent), P1 is delegated → plays A0 → you get 10

But you were getting 4 before — so **you gain 10 > 4** → so deviation to A0 is profitable!

Wait — this breaks the equilibrium.

So if both delegate → you get 4

But if you deviate to A0: now only P1 delegates → med plays A0 → P1 plays A0, you play A0 → you get 10 → **you gain**

So it's **better** to deviate to A0.

So **(A2, A2)** is **not** an equilibrium.

Similarly, if both players play A2 → each wants to deviate to A0 to get 10 instead of 4.

So not stable.

---

### **Try: Both players play A0**

Then:
- Both play A0 → no delegation → payoffs: both get 10

Can a player deviate?

Suppose Player 2 deviates to A2 (delegate).

Then:
- P1: A0 (independent) → plays A0
- P2: A2 → delegates → only one delegate → mediator plays A0 → P2 plays A0
So both play A0 → you get 10 — same as before.

So no gain.

Deviate to A1? Then:
- P1: A0 → plays A0
- P2: A1 → plays A1
Then: you get 20, opponent gets 0

You get 20 > 10 → so **very profitable**

Thus, **A0 is not stable** — each player wants to deviate to A1 when opponent plays A0.

So (A0, A0) is not stable.

---

### **Try: Both players play A1**

Then:
- Both play A1 → no delegation → payoffs: both get 4

Can a player deviate?

Deviate to A0: then P1: A1 → plays A1; P2: A0 → plays A0 → you get 2 < 4 → worse

Deviate to A2: then P1: A1 → plays A1; P2: A2 → delegates → only one delegate → med plays A0 → P2 plays A0

So you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 2 < 4 → worse

So no incentive to deviate → **(A1, A1)** is **stable**? Maybe.

But wait — can we do better by **sometimes** delegating?

Let’s test mixed strategies.

---

### **Try: Both players delegate with some probability**

Let’s suppose both players choose A2 with probability $ r $, A0 with $ 1-r $, and A1 with 0 — i.e., only A0 and A2.

So strategy: choose A0 with prob $ 1 - r $, A2 with prob $ r $

Then possible outcomes:

| P1 | P2 | Delegates | Mediator | Your Payoff |
|----|----|-----------|----------|-------------|
| A0 | A0 | 0         | —        | 10          |
| A0 | A2 | 1         | A0       | 10 (both A0)|
| A2 | A0 | 1         | A0       | 10          |
| A2 | A2 | 2         | A1       | 4           |

Probabilities:
- Both A0: $ (1 - r)^2 $ → payoff 10
- P1 A0, P2 A2: $ (1 - r) r $ → payoff 10
- P1 A2, P2 A0: $ r (1 - r) $ → payoff 10
- Both A2: $ r^2 $ → payoff 4

So your expected payoff:
$$
E = (1 - r)^2 \cdot 10 + 2 \cdot r(1 - r) \cdot 10 + r^2 \cdot 4
$$
$$
= 10(1 - 2r + r^2) + 20r(1 - r) + 4r^2
$$
$$
= 10 - 20r + 10r^2 + 20r - 20r^2 + 4r^2
$$
$$
= 10 + ( -20r + 20r ) + (10r^2 - 20r^2 + 4r^2) = 10 - 6r^2
$$

So $ E = 10 - 6r^2 $

This is **maximized when $ r = 0 $**, giving $ E = 10 $

So **delegating reduces your expected payoff** in this strategy — worse than playing A0.

So why delegate?

Unless you can coordinate to both delegate and get A1 → but we saw that A1 gives only 4.

So not good.

But earlier: if both play A1, you get 4, and deviating gives less → but we can get more.

Wait — maybe **we should consider a mixed strategy where we mix A0 and A2**, but with **higher probability on A0** to get 10.

But if opponent is playing A0, you can get 20 by playing A1.

But if you play A1, opponent gets 0 → so opponent might not want to play A0.

Let’s think differently.

---

### **Try: You play A1 with high probability**

But opponent sees: if you play A1, and I play A0, then I get 0 → so opponent **won’t play A0** if they expect you to play A1.

So opponent might prefer to play A1, or delegate.

Let’s suppose you play A1.

Then:
- If opponent plays A0 → you get 20, opponent gets 0
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 4, opponent gets 4
- If opponent plays A2 (delegate) → then only one delegate → med plays A0 → opponent plays A0 → you play A1 → payoff 20

Wait: if opponent delegates → med plays A0 → opponent plays A0 → you are playing A1 → you get **20**

So if you play A1, no matter what opponent does, you get 20 or 4?

- If opponent plays A0: you get 20
- If opponent plays A1: you get 4
- If opponent plays A2: you get 20 (since opponent plays A0 via med)

So if you play A1, and opponent plays A0 or A2, you get 20; only if opponent plays A1, you get 4.

So if opponent is **not** playing A1, you get 20.

But if opponent plays A1, you get 4.

So to maximize your payoff, **you want opponent not to play A1**.

But opponent doesn't want to play A0 if you play A1, because then they get 0.

They also don't want to play A2? Let’s see: if you play A1, and they play A2 → then only one delegate → med plays A0 → they play A0 → you get 20 → they get 0

So they get 0.

So no matter what opponent does, **they get 0 if they don't play A1**.

Their only way to get points is to play A1, where they get 4.

So rational opponent will **play A1** to get 4 instead of 0.

Thus, if you play A1, opponent will play A1 → you both get 4.

So your payoff is 4.

Can you do better?

Yes — if you play A0, and opponent plays A0, you get 10.

But opponent might not want to play A0.

If you play A0, and opponent plays A0: they get 10 → good
If opponent plays A1: they get 6 → better than 4 → they prefer A1?
Wait: if you play A0, opponent:
- A0 → gets 10
- A1 → gets 6
- A2 → then med plays A0 → opponent plays A0 → gets 10

So opponent will **not** play A1 — they get only 6 < 10

So if you play A0, opponent gets 10 whether they play A0 or A2.

So they will **strictly prefer to play A0** (or A2), not A1.

So if you play A0, opponent plays A0 or A2 → both give them 10.

So opponent will not play A1.

Therefore, if you play A0, opponent plays A0 or A2 → in both cases, they play A0 → you play A0 → you get 10.

So you get 10.

But earlier, if you play A1, you get 4.

So better to play A0.

But what if you delegate?

Suppose you play A2 (delegate).

Then the mediator’s action depends on how many delegate.

If opponent plays A0 or A1: only you delegate → med plays A0 → you play A0 → you get payoff based on opponent:

- If opponent plays A0 → both A0 → you get 10
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 2

But opponent knows: if they play A1, they get 6

If they play A0 → they get 10

So they will play A0.

Therefore, if you delegate, and opponent plays A0, then opponent plays A0, you play A0 → you get 10

Same as playing A0 directly.

But can you **benefit** from delegation?

Only if you can induce opponent to play differently.

But in this case, they have no incentive.

Wait — suppose **you play A2**, and **opponent plays A1**

Then only you delegate → med plays A0 → you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 2

But opponent gets 6

But if opponent instead played A0 (or A2), they get 10 → so they won’t play A1.

So again, they play A0.

So if you delegate, and opponent plays A0, you get 10.

Same as playing A0.

But if you delegate and opponent plays A1, you get 2 — but they won’t.

So delegation is **no better** than A0.

But earlier, if **both** delegate → med plays A1 → both get 4

Worse.

So is A0 best?

But earlier we saw that if you play A0, opponent plays A0 or A2 → you get 10

But what if you **randomize**?

Suppose you play A0 with high probability, but sometimes A2.

But if you ever play A2, opponent might still play A0 → you get 10

But if opponent plays A1, you get 2 — but they don't want to.

So still safe.

But **can you get more than 10**?

Only if you can make opponent play A0, and you play A1 → then you get 20

But if you play A1, opponent will play A1 to avoid getting 0 → so you get 4

So you can't get 20 unless opponent plays A0.

Can you **force** opponent to play A0?

Only if you commit to not playing A1.

But if you play A0, opponent plays A0 (since it's best response) → you get 10

But not 20.

But **what if you delegate with certain probability**?

Let’s suppose you play A2 with probability $ r $, and A0 with $ 1 - r $, and A1 with 0.

Then opponent, knowing your strategy, will respond optimally.

Opponent faces:

- If they play A0: they get 10 regardless (since you either play A0 or med plays A0) → so guaranteed 10
- If they play A1: they get 6 (if you play A0), or 4 (if med plays A1) → but med plays A1 only if both delegate → prob $ r $ if they delegate → so only if they also delegate.

Wait, let's compute opponent’s expected payoff for each choice.

### **Expected payoff for opponent if they play A0:**

- You play A0: prob $ 1 - r $ → you play A0, opponent plays A0 → opponent gets 10
- You play A2: prob $ r $ → med plays A0 (only one delegate), so you play A0 → opponent plays A0 → gets 10

So **opponent always gets 10** if they play A0.

### **If opponent plays A1:**

- You play A0: prob $ 1 - r $ → you play A0, opponent plays A1 → opponent gets 6
- You play A2: prob $ r $ → only one delegate → med plays A0 → you play A0 → opponent plays A1 → gets 6

So opponent gets 6 no matter what.

So they strictly prefer A0 → choose A0.

So your expected payoff: you either play A0 directly, or med plays A0 → so you always play A0 → opponent plays A0 → you get 10

So **regardless of r**, your payoff is 10.

So you might as well play A0 with probability 1.

But is there a better strategy?

What if you **sometimes** try to **induce delegation** when you want to play A1?

Wait — only when **both** delegate, med plays A1.

So if you **both** delegate, you play A1.

So suppose you choose A2 with high probability, and opponent also chooses A2.

Then both delegate → med plays A1 → you get 4

But if you play A2 and opponent plays A0, you get 10

So you get 10 when opp plays A0, 4 when they both delegate.

But opponent gets 10 if they play A0, 10 if they play A2 (since you play A0), 4 if they play A1.

So they prefer A0 or A2 over A1.

So they won’t play A1.

So if you play A2, opponent plays A0 → you get 10

But can you **induce them to delegate**?

Only if delegation gives them more.

But if they delegate, and you play A0, then only one delegate → med plays A0 → they get 10

Same as playing A0.

So **zero incentive to delegate**.

So opponent will **not** delegate unless it gives better payoff.

But it doesn’t.

So opponent will **play A0** if you don’t play A1.

But if you play A1, opponent plays A1 (to avoid 0), and you get 4.

So you get 4.

So no.

But wait — is there a **mixed strategy equilibrium** where you play A0, A1, A2 in a way that opponent is indifferent?

Let’s think about a **Nash equilibrium** where both players are randomizing.

Suppose Player 2 uses a mixed strategy: play A0, A1, A2 with certain probabilities.

But let’s try to find a **symmetric equilibrium** where both players use the same strategy.

Let’s suppose the optimal strategy is to **play A0 and A2**, not A1.

Why not play A1? Because it only gives 4 when opponent plays A1, but opponent will avoid A1 if you might play A1.

But if you never play A1, opponent has no reason to.

So maybe A1 is dominated?

Let’s check.

Can you show A1 is dominated?

Suppose opponent plays a fixed strategy.

Let’s compare your expected payoff from playing A1 vs A0 vs A2.

But it depends.

Alternatively, let’s suppose the **equilibrium** is for both players to play A0 with probability 1.

Then you get 10.

If you deviate to A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 20 → better!

So not equilibrium.

But if both play A0, you can deviate to A1 and get 20.

So equilibrium cannot be pure A0.

Earlier we tried A1, A1 — then you get 4, and no incentive to deviate if opponent plays A1.

But if you deviate to A0, you get 2 < 4 → worse

Deviate to A2: then only you delegate → med plays A0 → you play A0, opp plays A1 → you get 2 < 4 → worse

So (A1, A1) is a **Nash equilibrium**.

But is it the best?

In this equilibrium, you get 4.

But you can get 10 in A0, A0 — but that’s not equilibrium.

So only if both play A0, but then you want to deviate.

So there are **multiple equilibria**.

We need the one where **you** get the most.

But the game is symmetric, so both players have the same options.

In the (A1, A1) equilibrium, you get 4.

In the (A0, A0) equilibrium, you get 10 — but it's unstable.

So rational players might not stay there.

But there might be a **mixed strategy equilibrium** where you can get more than 4.

Try this: suppose Player 2 uses a mixed strategy to make Player 1 indifferent between A0 and A1, and also between A0 and A2.

But easier to suppose that both players use a strategy where they play A0 with high probability, but A2 occasionally.

Let’s suppose that **Player 2 plays A0 with probability 90%, A2 with 10%**.

Then opponent's expected payoff for each choice:

- If opponent plays A0: gets 10
- If opponent plays A1: gets 6 (since you either play A0, so 6)
- If opponent plays A2: then only one delegate (you play A2 only 10% of the time), so usually only one delegate → med plays A0 → opponent plays A0 → gets 10

So opponent gets 10 if they play A0 or A2, 6 if A1.

So they will play A0 or A2.

So you will always play A0 (since you play A0 with 90%, or med plays A0 if you delegate) → so you get 10.

So you get 10.

But if you play A2, and opponent plays A0, you get 10.

Same.

But can you do better?

Only if you can make the opponent play A0 and you play A1.

But if you play A1, and opponent plays A0, you get 20.

But if you play A1, then opponent gets 0 if they play A0 — so they won't.

So only if you can **commit** to playing A1 with high probability, but then opponent plays A1.

So you get 4.

So you trade-off.

But here's a key insight: **you can use delegation to effectively play A0 at no cost, while making the opponent have no incentive to deviate.**

But still, your best payoff is 10 in the (A0, A0) case, but it's not stable.

But in the (A1, A1) equilibrium, you get 4.

But perhaps there's a **mixed strategy where you achieve more than 4**.

Let’s try to find a symmetric equilibrium.

Suppose both players use (A0: p, A1: q, A2: r), p+q+r=1.

But too many variables.

Alternatively, let’s suppose that in equilibrium, you play only A0 and A2, and opponent does the same.

Then we saw that your expected payoff is 10, as long as opponent plays A0 or A2.

And they will, because playing A1 gives only 6 < 10.

So you can achieve 10.

And by playing A2, if opponent is playing A0, you still get 10.

So you can choose any mix of A0 and A2.

But what if you play A2 with high probability? Does it help?

No, since outcome is the same.

But is there a risk?

Only if opponent plays A1.

But they won't, as 6 < 10.

So the only thing that matters is that opponent plays A0 or A2.

So you can achieve 10 for sure.

Can you get 20?

Only if you play A1 and opponent plays A0.

But if you play A1, opponent gets 0, so they won't.

Unless they are not rational.

So rational players won't.

Therefore, the best you can do is 10.

And you can achieve it by playing A0 with probability 1.

Or by playing A2 with probability 1, but then if opponent plays A1, you get 2, but they won't.

Or mix.

But why not just play A0?

Because A2 is not helpful.

But the question asks for a **probability distribution over A0, A1, A2**.

We can put A0 = 100, A1 = 0, A2 = 0.

But is there a better strategy?

What if you play A2 with some probability to make opponent indifferent?

Suppose you play A0 with probability 0, A2 with 1.

Then if opponent plays A0: you get 10
If opponent plays A1: you get 2
If opponent plays A2: then both delegate, med plays A1, you get 4

But opponent gets 10 if A0, 6 if A1, 4 if A2.

So they play A0.

You get 10.

Same as before.

Suppose you play A2 with 90%, A0 with 10%.

Then if opponent plays A0: you get 10
If opponents plays A1: you get 2
If opponents plays A2: then two delegates only if they play A2, prob 2*(0.1*0.1) wait no.

If you play A2 with 90%, opponent plays A2 with 10%, then both delegate with prob 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.09, med plays A1, you get 4

Other cases: you play A2, opponent plays A0 or A2: if opponent plays A0, you get 10; if opponent plays A2, you get 4.

But opponent will not play A2, because they get 4 < 10.

So they play A0.

So you get 10.

So still 10.

So in all cases, as long as you don't play A1, you can achieve 10.

So best is to play A0 with 100%.

But is there any benefit to playing A1?

Only if you can make opponent play A0.

But if you play A1, they won't.

Unless you can commit to not playing A1, but you can't.

Therefore, the best you can do is to play A0 with probability 1, get 10.

But wait — in the (A1, A1) equilibrium, you get 4.

So 10 is better.

And you can achieve 10 by playing A0.

But can you get more than 10?

Only if you can make opponent play A0 and you play A1.

But that requires them to play A0, which they won't if you play A1.

So no.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to never play A1, and play A0 or A2.

And since A0 and A2 give the same outcome when opponent plays A0 (which they will), you can choose anything.

But to maximize your points, you want to be at 10.

The simplest is to play A0 with 100%.

But let's check if playing A2 helps.

No.

So final answer: play A0 with 100%.

But wait — there's a twist.

The mediator's default is to play A0 if one delegate, A1 if two.

But in our case, if you play A2, and opponent plays A0, you get A0 anyway.

So no benefit.

So we can set A0 = 100.

But the instruction is to choose a probability distribution over A0, A1, A2.

We can set:
- A0: 100
- A1: 0
- A2: 0

But is it possible that a mixed strategy can do better?

Suppose you play A2 with 100%.

Then if opponent plays A0, you get 10.
If opponent plays A1, you get 2.
If opponent plays A2, you get 4.

But opponent will play A0, so you get 10.

Same.

But if you ever play A1, you get 4 or 2, worse.

So no.

Therefore, the optimal is to play A0 with probability 1.

But let's double-check the initial thought.

Earlier I thought if both play A2, you get 4.

But you can choose not to do that.

So in your strategy, you can avoid that by not playing A2.

So best to play A0.

Final decision: play A0 with 100%.

But let's not forget: if you play A0, and opponent plays A1, you get 2.
But opponent won't play A1, because they get 6, while they can get 10.

So they play A0.

So you get 10.

Yes.

So you should play A0 with probability 100.

Answer:
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0, "A2": 0}

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediator)**

We are in a strategic interaction with two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses between A0 and A1, simultaneously.

The payoff matrix (Player 1’s payoff, Player 2’s payoff) is:

|             | P2: A0       | P2: A1       |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0**  | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **P1: A1**  | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

This is a modified version of the "Battle of the Sexes" or "Coordination with Incentive for Defection" type game.

---

### **Step 2: Introduce the Mediator – New Action A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

Now, **Player 1** has a new action: A2 (Delegate to Mediator).

- If **Player 1 delegates**, then the mediator will play on their behalf based on **how many players have delegated** to it.
- The mediator's behavior:
  - If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A1
  - If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0

Note: Player 2 also has the same option to delegate (but we are only choosing for Player 1).

So, the total number of delegates determines the mediator’s action.

Let’s denote:
- Player 1 chooses to A0, A1, or A2 (delegate).
- Player 2 independently chooses their own action (A0, A1, or A2).

But we are to compute **Player 1's optimal strategy** — the probabilities to assign to A0, A1, A2 — **maximizing their expected payoff**, taking into account all possible behaviors of Player 2 (who may also delegate or not).

We assume Player 2 is rational and will act to maximize their own payoff as well.

This is a **simultaneous move game with incomplete information about the other player’s strategy**, but we can find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

But since the mediator’s action depends on **the number of delegators**, the full state space depends on the joint decisions.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Mediator’s Behavior**

Let’s define the mediator’s action based on the number of delegators:

| # Delegators | Mediator Action |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 0            | Not applicable (no one delegated) |
| 1            | A1              |
| 2            | A0              |

So:
- If only you delegate → mediator plays A1 (you get A1 on their behalf)
- If both you and Player 2 delegate → mediator plays A0 (you get A0)

Important: If **you delegate**, **your action becomes whatever the mediator does**, which depends on **how many delegates there are**.

So, the outcome for you depends on:
- Whether you delegate
- Whether Player 2 delegates
- Which action the mediator then plays

---

### **Step 4: Enumerate Player 1's Choices (including delegation)**

Player 1 can choose A0, A1, or A2.

We are to compute a mixed strategy over A0, A1, A2 (probabilities p0, p1, p2), with p0 + p1 + p2 = 100.

Let’s define:
- p0 = P(Player 1 chooses A0)
- p1 = P(Player 1 chooses A1)
- p2 = P(Player 1 chooses A2)

Now, we consider Player 2’s possible strategies. But since the setup says “you are playing in the position of Player 1”, and the mediator was selected via approval voting (so it's a fixed entity), we assume Player 2 is rational and may choose to delegate or not based on their own payoff.

But we must find a **stable equilibrium** — likely a symmetric or mutual best-response strategy.

Alternatively, we can consider that **Player 2 may also be optimizing**, and we are to find the symmetric Nash equilibrium.

But the problem says:

> "You are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game."

So we are to decide **Player 1’s strategy**, assuming Player 2 is also rational.

We need to determine **what Player 1 should do**, given that Player 2 may delegate or not, and the outcome depends on both choices.

So, we must **reason about the possible joint outcomes and expected payoffs**.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and will choose to **delegate or not** in a way that maximizes their payoff.

But since the game is symmetric (both players have same options), we can suspect that in equilibrium, **both players will use the same strategy** — i.e., a symmetric mixed strategy.

Let us **assume symmetry**: both players use the same mixed strategy (p0, p1, p2) for A0, A1, A2.

Then we can compute the expected payoff to Player 1 for each action (A0, A1, A2), and find a strategy where no player wants to deviate — i.e., best response.

We want Player 1 to choose p0, p1, p2 such that their **expected payoff is max**, assuming Player 2 plays the same strategy.

---

### **Step 5: Model the Game with Delegation**

Let’s suppose both players independently choose:

- A0 with probability p0
- A1 with probability p1
- A2 (delegate) with probability p2

We must compute the expected payoff to Player 1, given that Player 2 uses the same strategy.

But the mediator’s action depends on how many people delegate: 0, 1, or 2.

So we must consider all combinations of Player 1 and Player 2’s choices.

Let’s consider the six possible combinations:

| P1 Choice | P2 Choice | # Delegators | Mediator Action | P1's Action | P2's Action | Payoff (P1, P2) |
|----------|----------|---------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| A0       | A0       | 0             | -               | A0           | A0           | (10, 10)         |
| A0       | A1       | 0             | -               | A0           | A1           | (0, 20)          |
| A0       | A2       | 1             | A1              | A0 (P1’s choice) | A1 (from med) | (6, 2)         |
| A1       | A0       | 0             | -               | A1           | A0           | (6, 2)           |
| A1       | A1       | 0             | -               | A1           | A1           | (4, 4)           |
| A1       | A2       | 1             | A1              | A1           | A1           | (4, 4)           |
| A2       | A0       | 1             | A1              | A1 (med)     | A0           | (6, 2)           |
| A2       | A1       | 1             | A1              | A1 (med)     | A1           | (4, 4)           |
| A2       | A2       | 2             | A0              | A0 (med)     | A0 (med)     | (10, 10)         |

Wait — let’s clarify:

- If **P1 delegates**, then **P1’s effective action is whatever the mediator does**, based on total number of delegators.

So:

- If **only one delegate** → mediator plays A1 → so **P1 plays A1**
- If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 → so **P1 plays A0**

Similarly, P2’s action is:
- If P2 chooses A0 → P2 plays A0
- If P2 chooses A1 → P2 plays A1
- If P2 chooses A2 → P2 plays whatever the mediator does (A1 if only P2 delegates, A0 if both delegate)

So the outcome is fully determined by both players’ choices.

Let’s now compute all 9 combinations systematically (P1 action × P2 action) with the effective actions and payoff.

---

### **Step 6: Build Payoff Table with All Combinations**

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (p0) | A1 (p1) | A2 (p2) |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A0** | (10,10) | (0,20) | (6,2) → P1: A0 vs A1 (P2 delegated → med plays A1) |
| **A1** | (6,2)  | (4,4)  | (4,4) → P1: A1 vs A1 (P2 med A1) |
| **A2** | (6,2) → P1: med A1 vs A0 | (4,4) → P1: med A1 vs A1 | (10,10) → both med A0 |

Wait — need precise analysis.

Let’s go one by one.

---

**Case 1: P1 = A0, P2 = A0**
- No delegation → both play A0 → (10,10)

**Case 2: P1 = A0, P2 = A1**
- No delegation → (0,20)

**Case 3: P1 = A0, P2 = A2**
- P2 delegates, P1 doesn’t → 1 delegator → med plays A1 → P2 plays A1
- P1 plays A0
- So: (0,20) → P1: A0 vs A1 → payoff (0,20)

Wait — this is important: **P1's payoff depends only on their effective action and P2’s effective action**, not on their choice of A0/A1/A2.

So in this case:
- P1’s effective action: A0 (since they didn’t delegate)
- P2’s effective action: A1 (since med played A1 for 1 delegate)
- So payoff is (0,20)

Same as if P1 had chosen A0 and P2 had chosen A1.

**Case 4: P1 = A1, P2 = A0**
- No delegation → (6,2)

**Case 5: P1 = A1, P2 = A1**
- No delegation → (4,4)

**Case 6: P1 = A1, P2 = A2**
- P2 delegates, P1 doesn’t → 1 delegator → med plays A1 → P2 plays A1
- P1 plays A1
- So A1 vs A1 → (4,4)

**Case 7: P1 = A2, P2 = A0**
- P1 delegates, P2 doesn’t → 1 delegator → med plays A1 → P1 plays A1
- P2 plays A0
- So A1 vs A0 → (6,2)

**Case 8: P1 = A2, P2 = A1**
- P1 delegates, P2 doesn’t → 1 delegator → med plays A1 → P1 plays A1
- P2 plays A1
- So A1 vs A1 → (4,4)

**Case 9: P1 = A2, P2 = A2**
- Both delegate → 2 delegators → med plays A0 → both play A0
- So A0 vs A0 → (10,10)

---

Now, summarize the **payoff to Player 1** for each pair:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|--------|---|---|---|
| **A0** | 10 | 0 | 0 |  ← Case 3: P2 delegates → P2 plays A1 → P1 A0 vs A1 = 0
| **A1** | 6 | 4 | 4 |  ← Cases 4–6
| **A2** | 6 | 4 | 10 | ← Cases 7–9: A2 vs A0 → A1 vs A0 → 6; A2 vs A1 → A1 vs A1 → 4; A2 vs A2 → A0 vs A0 → 10

So the **Player 1 payoff matrix** (given P2's pure strategy) is:

| P1 → P2 ↓ | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|-----------|----|----|----|
| A0        | 10 | 0  | 0  |
| A1        | 6  | 4  | 4  |
| A2        | 6  | 4  | 10 |

This is critical.

Now, we are to find a **mixed strategy** for Player 1 (p0 for A0, p1 for A1, p2 for A2) that is a **best response** to Player 2 using the **same strategy** (symmetric equilibrium assumption).

Assume both players use the same mixed strategy: p0, p1, p2, p0 + p1 + p2 = 1.

Then, the **expected payoff to Player 1** from each action is:

Let E[A0] = expected payoff if P1 chooses A0
E[A1] = payoff if P1 chooses A1
E[A2] = payoff if P1 chooses A2

Then:
- E[A0] = p0 * 10 + p1 * 0 + p2 * 0 = 10 p0
- E[A1] = p0 * 6 + p1 * 4 + p2 * 4 = 6 p0 + 4 p1 + 4 p2
- E[A2] = p0 * 6 + p1 * 4 + p2 * 10 = 6 p0 + 4 p1 + 10 p2

In a symmetric Nash equilibrium, the expected payoff of each action that is played with positive probability must be **equal**, and no action should give a higher payoff.

So we suppose that **all three actions are used** (p0>0, p1>0, p2>0), then:

E[A0] = E[A1] = E[A2]

Set:
(1) 10 p0 = 6 p0 + 4 p1 + 4 p2
(2) 10 p0 = 6 p0 + 4 p1 + 10 p2

And (3) p0 + p1 + p2 = 1

Solve:

From (1):
10 p0 = 6 p0 + 4 p1 + 4 p2  
→ 4 p0 = 4 p1 + 4 p2  
→ p0 = p1 + p2  → (equation A)

From (2):
10 p0 = 6 p0 + 4 p1 + 10 p2  
→ 4 p0 = 4 p1 + 10 p2  
→ 2 p0 = 2 p1 + 5 p2  → (equation B)

Now use (A): p0 = p1 + p2

Substitute into (B):
2(p1 + p2) = 2 p1 + 5 p2  
→ 2 p1 + 2 p2 = 2 p1 + 5 p2  
→ 2 p2 = 5 p2  
→ 3 p2 = 0 → p2 = 0

Then from (A): p0 = p1 + 0 → p0 = p1

From (3): p0 + p1 + 0 = 1 → 2 p0 = 1 → p0 = 0.5, p1 = 0.5

So solution: p0 = 50, p1 = 50, p2 = 0

But we **assumed p2 > 0**, but got p2 = 0 → contradiction.

So **not all three actions are used** in equilibrium.

Now try case: **only A0 and A1 are used (p2 = 0)**

Then p0 + p1 = 1 → p1 = 1 - p0

Then:
E[A0] = 10 p0
E[A1] = 6 p0 + 4 p1 = 6 p0 + 4(1 - p0) = 6 p0 + 4 - 4 p0 = 2 p0 + 4

Set E[A0] = E[A1]:
10 p0 = 2 p0 + 4  
→ 8 p0 = 4 → p0 = 0.5 → p1 = 0.5

Now check E[A2]:
E[A2] = 6 p0 + 4 p1 + 10 p2 = 6*0.5 + 4*0.5 + 0 = 3 + 2 = 5

E[A0] = 10 * 0.5 = 5  
E[A1] = 2*0.5 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5  
So E[A2] = 5 → same as others

So actually, **E[A2] = 5**, and E[A0] = E[A1] = 5 → so **A2 is also a best response**

But if p2 = 0, then A2 gives same payoff — so **Player 1 is indifferent** between A2 and A0/A1.

But if both players are playing p0 = 50, p1 = 50, p2 = 0, then the expected payoff from A2 is 5 — same as others.

So **Player 1 could deviate to A2 and get same payoff**.

But **is it a best response**? Yes, since it gives same payoff.

But in equilibrium, if Player 2 is playing p0=50, p1=50, p2=0, then Player 1 gets:
- A0: 10 * 0.5 = 5
- A1: 6*0.5 + 4*0.5 = 3 + 2 = 5
- A2: 6*0.5 + 4*0.5 = 3 + 2 = 5

So all give 5 → **any mixture is best response**

But let’s see if **p2 > 0** can be part of equilibrium.

Now suppose we try a strategy with p2 > 0, but not all three.

Try **A2 and A0 only** (p1 = 0)

Then p0 + p2 = 1 → p0 = 1 - p2

E[A0] = 10 p0 = 10(1 - p2)
E[A2] = 6 p0 + 10 p2 = 6(1 - p2) + 10 p2 = 6 - 6 p2 + 10 p2 = 6 + 4 p2

Set E[A0] = E[A2]:
10(1 - p2) = 6 + 4 p2  
10 - 10 p2 = 6 + 4 p2  
10 - 6 = 14 p2  
4 = 14 p2 → p2 = 4/14 = 2/7 ≈ 28.57%

Then p0 = 1 - 2/7 = 5/7 ≈ 71.43%

Now check E[A1]:
E[A1] = 6 p0 + 4 p1 + 4 p2 = 6*(5/7) + 0 + 4*(2/7) = 30/7 + 8/7 = 38/7 ≈ 5.428

Now E[A0] = 10*(5/7) = 50/7 ≈ 7.14
E[A2] = 6 + 4*(2/7) = 6 + 8/7 = 50/7 ≈ 7.14 → same

But E[A1] ≈ 5.43 < 7.14 → so A1 gives less → so not a best response

So if Player 1 uses {A0, A2} → then A1 is dominated

But the problem is that **Player 2 is also playing** symmetrically

So if Player 1 plays p0 = 5/7, p1 = 0, p2 = 2/7, then **Player 2** should be playing the same.

Now compute **E[A1] for Player 1** when Player 2 uses p0=5/7, p1=0, p2=2/7:

E[A1] = 6*p0 + 4*p1 + 4*p2 = 6*(5/7) + 0 + 4*(2/7) = 30/7 + 8/7 = 38/7 ≈ 5.43

E[A0] = 10*p0 = 10*(5/7) = 50/7 ≈ 7.14
E[A2] = 6*p0 + 4*p1 + 10*p2 = 6*(5/7) + 0 + 10*(2/7) = 30/7 + 20/7 = 50/7 ≈ 7.14

So A1 gives only 5.43 < 7.14 → so Player 1 would **not** play A1 → so p1=0 is fine.

But now, could Player 1 **deviate to A1?** No, because it gives lower payoff.

So this is **a symmetric equilibrium** in which both players use:
- A0: 5/7 ≈ 71.43%
- A1: 0%
- A2: 2/7 ≈ 28.57%

But wait — is this **consistent** with the idea that **if 2 players delegate, mediator plays A0**, which is great for both.

But let’s check **if any player wants to deviate**.

Suppose both players play {A0: 5/7, A2: 2/7}

Then, if a player deviates to A1, their expected payoff is 5.43 < 7.14 → so no.

If they deviate to A0: 7.14 → same.
A2: same.

So yes, **it is a best response**.

But now check the **earlier symmetric strategy** where p0=50%, p1=50%, p2=0 → in that case, E[A2] = 5 — same as others, but no benefit.

But in that strategy, if a player **switches to A2**, they still get 5 — same.

But in the other strategy (p2>0), the payoff from A2 is **higher** — 7.14 — so **stronger incentive**.

But now the key: **in the symmetric equilibrium with p2=0**, is deviation to A2 profitable? No, because payoff is same (5). But in the other one, it's **exactly equal**, so indifferent.

But now, let's **compare the two symmetric equilibria**:

1. **(A0: 50%, A1: 50%)**, p2=0 → expected payoff per player = 5

2. **(A0: 71.43%, A2: 28.57%)**, p1=0 → expected payoff = 7.14

The second one is **better**.

But can a player **unilaterally change strategy** to get a higher payoff?

Wait — in equilibrium, both players use strategy S: (A0: 5/7, A2: 2/7), then expected payoff is 50/7 ≈ 7.14

If one player deviates to A1 → gets E[A1] = 38/7 ≈ 5.43 < 7.14 → bad

To A0 → 50/7 → same

To A2 → same

So no incentive to deviate.

But what if **Player 1** considers a different strategy — perhaps including A1?

But we’ve seen that A1 gives lower payoff.

But is there a **better equilibrium**?

What if both players use **only A2**?

Then p2=1

Then:
- # Delegators = 2 → med plays A0
- So both play A0 → payoff (10,10)

Now, compute expected payoff from other actions:

If Player 1 deviates to A0:
- P2 plays A0 (since they use A2 → med plays A0)
- P1 plays A0
- So (10,10) → payoff 10 > 10? No, **same**

Wait: if P2 uses A2 → they play A0 (since 2 delegators)

So if P1 plays A0 → both A0 → (10,10)

If P1 plays A1 → both A0 → still (10,10)? No!

Wait: if P1 plays A1, but P2 plays A0 → result is (6,2)

So:
- If P1 deviates to A1: P1’s effective action: A1, P2’s: A0 → payoff (6,2) → P1 gets 6 < 10 → worse

- If P1 deviates to A2: still both play A0 → payoff 10 → same.

So **A2 and A0 are best responses**, but A1 is worse.

So if both play A2, then A2 and A0 give 10, A1 gives 6 → so best response includes A0 and A2.

But **not rational to play A1**.

So if both play A2, it's a **best response** for both to play A0 or A2.

But now, what if one player plays A2, and the other considers deviating?

But in symmetric equilibrium with p2=1 (both play A2), the payoff is 10.

Can a player **do better** by deviating?

- Deviate to A0: still gets 10 → same
- Deviate to A1: gets 6 → worse

So yes, **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium** with payoff (10,10) for both.

Similarly, if both play A2, they both get **10**.

But in the earlier strategy (A0: 71.4%, A2: 28.6%), the expected payoff is **only 7.14**, which is **less than 10**.

So why would anyone play that?

Ah — so clearly, **(A2, A2)** is a **better equilibrium**.

But is there a **problem**?

If both play A2, they get 10.

But if **one player deviates to A0**, they still get 10 → same.

But if one deviates to A1, they get 6 → worse.

But now, suppose **one player commits to A0**.

But in symmetric equilibrium, both are rational.

But if both players play A2, each gets 10.

But is this **stable**?

Yes — no incentive to deviate unilaterally.

But could there be **a problem with delegation**?

Suppose Player 1 is considering: if I play A2, and Player 2 plays A2, then **both** are delegated, so **mediator plays A0**, so we both get **10**.

But if I deviate to A0, I still get 10 (since P2 plays A0), so same.

Similarly, if I play A1, I get 6 — worse.

So it's **equilibrium**.

But now — **what if only one player delegates?**

Then mediator plays A1.

So if one player delegates (A2), and the other plays A0, then:
- P1: A2 → med plays A1
- P2: A0 → A0
- So A1 vs A0 → (6,2)

So the delegator gets **6**, the non-delegator gets **2**

So if I delegate unilaterally when the other plays A0, I get 6, while if I play A0 myself I get 10 — **worse**

So only **if both delegate**, do I get 10.

So **delegation is only beneficial if both delegate**

Thus, **(A2, A2)** is a Nash equilibrium where both get 10, and no one wants to deviate.

Similarly, **(A0, A0)** is also a Nash equilibrium, with payoff (10,10)

But in that case, if one deviates to A1, gets 6 — worse.

So **multiple equilibria**.

But the question is: **which one should Player 1 play to maximize expected points?**

But **in equilibrium**, if both players play A2, we get 10.

But if I **randomize**, I might end up in bad states.

But since we need to **choose a strategy**, and we assume Player 2 is rational, we can aim for the **best equilibrium**.

But we must **commit to a mixed strategy**.

Is there a reason to mix?

Suppose Player 1 plays **only A2**.

Then:
- If Player 2 plays A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → P1 gets 10
- If Player 2 plays A0 → only P1 delegates → med plays A1 → P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 6
- If Player 2 plays A1 → only P1 delegates → med plays A1 → P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 4

So if Player 1 plays A2 **purely**, and Player 2 plays:
- A0: P1 gets 6
- A1: P1 gets 4
- A2: P1 gets 10

So if Player 2 is rational, **does Player 2 want to play A2?**

If P1 plays A2, then:
- If P2 plays A0 → P2 gets 2 (since P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0) → (6,2)
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1 → (4,4)
- If P2 plays A2 → both play A0 → (10,10)

So P2 gets:
- A0: 2
- A1: 4
- A2: 10

So **best for P2 to play A2**

So **if Player 1 plays A2, Player 2’s best response is A2**, so we get (10,10)

Similarly, if Player 1 plays A2, and Player 2 is rational, Player 2 will play A2.

Similarly, if Player 1 plays A0, and Player 2 is rational, what will P2 do?

If P1 plays A0:
- P2 plays A0: (10,10)
- P2 plays A1: (0,20)
- P2 plays A2: P2 delegates → med plays A1 → P2 plays A1, P1 plays A0 → (0,20)

So for P2, best is A1 (get 20) or A2 (get 20)

So P2 will play A1 or A2, both give 20.

So if P1 plays A0, P2 will play A1 or A2 → P1 gets 0.

So **P1 gets 0** if they play A0.

Similarly, if P1 plays A1:
- P2 plays A0 → (6,2) — P1 gets 6
- P2 plays A1 → (4,4) — 4
- P2 plays A2 → P2 plays A1 → (4,4) — 4

So P2 will play A0 to get 2, or A1/A2 to get 4 → so P2 will play A1 or A2 → P1 gets 4

So **if P1 plays A1, P1 gets 4**

But if P1 plays A2, and assumes P2 is rational, P2 will play A2 → P1 gets 10

**So the best is to play A2 (delegate)**

Then, since both are rational, we end up in (A2, A2) → (10,10)

Thus, **by choosing A2, Player 1 guarantees 10 points**, assuming Player 2 is rational and will respond optimally.

Is there any risk?

Yes — if Player 2 is not rational, but the problem assumes they are.

In game theory, rational players will coordinate on **the equilibrium that gives them highest payoff**.

And (A2, A2) gives 10, which is better than any other outcome.

So the **best response** to rational Player 2 is to **choose A2**, because:

- If P2 is rational, they will play A2 when P1 plays A2
- So P1 gets 10

If P1 plays A0, P2 will not cooperate — they will play A1 or A2 → P1 gets 0

If P1 plays A1, P1 gets 4

So **best is to play A2**

Therefore, **Player 1 should play A2 with probability 100%**

So the optimal strategy is:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

But is this the only equilibrium?

What if Player 1 plays A0?

Then P2 will get 20 if they play A1 or A2 → so P2 will not play A0 → P1 gets 0.

So A0 is dominated.

A1 gives only 4.

A2 gives 10.

So **A2 is strictly dominant**?

Is it?

If P2 plays A0, then:
- P1 plays A2 → P1 gets 6
- P1 plays A0 → gets 10 → better

Ah! **If P2 plays A0, A0 is better for P1**

But P2 **will not play A0** if P1 plays A2, because then P2 gets only 2.

But if P1 plays A2, P2 will **choose A2**, so P1 gets 10.

But if P1 plays A0, P2 will choose A1, so P1 gets 0.

So **only when P1 plays A2 do we get a good outcome**

But the threat is: if P1 plays A0, P2 will punish by playing A1.

So **A2 is the best strategy to achieve the high payoff**

In fact, since **both A0 and A1 lead to low payoffs** against rational P2, and only **A2 leads to coordination on (10,10)**, the **dominant strategy** for Player 1 is to **delegate**, to trigger the mediator and coordinate on A0.

Thus, **best choice: A2 with 100% probability**

Final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)

We are in a two-player game where each player chooses between A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (for Player 1, you) is:

| Your Choice \ Opponent | A0        | A1        |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**                 | 10        | 0         |
| **A1**                 | 6         | 4         |

And for the opponent:
| Your Choice \ Opponent | A0        | A1        |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**                 | 10        | 20        |
| **A1**                 | 2         | 4         |

So this is a strategic interaction where:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → both get 10.
- You play A0, opponent A1 → you get 0, opponent gets 20 → bad for you.
- You play A1, opponent A0 → you get 6, opponent gets 2.
- You play A1, opponent A1 → both get 4.

This is **not** a zero-sum game.

---

### Step 2: Understand the twist — delegation to a mediator

You now have an **additional action: A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.

The mediator behaves as follows:
- If **only one player** delegates to it → mediator plays A1.
- If **both players** delegate to it → mediator plays A0.

So:
- If only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → your action becomes A1.
- If only the other player delegates → mediator plays A1 → their action is A1.
- If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 → both of your actions are A0.

But note: **you can choose whether to delegate or not**, and **the other player also decides independently**. Their choice affects the mediator’s behavior.

So, the outcome depends on **the joint decision** of both players on whether to delegate.

Let’s formalize the possible scenarios based on delegation choices:

#### Scenario 1: You delegate (A2), other player does not (A0 or A1)
- Then, only one player delegates → mediator plays A1 → **your action is A1**.
- The other player plays either A0 or A1 (based on their own choice).
- So your effective action is A1.

#### Scenario 2: You do not delegate (A0 or A1), other player delegates
- Only one player delegates (the other) → mediator plays A1 → **their action is A1**.
- You play A0 or A1.
- So their action is A1.

#### Scenario 3: Both delegate
- Two players delegate → mediator plays A0 → **both you and the other player play A0**.

So we can define effective actions based on delegation choices.

---

### Step 3: Define possible strategy profiles and outcomes

We are to choose a **mixed strategy** over A0, A1, A2. Let’s denote your strategy as:
- p0 = probability of choosing A0
- p1 = probability of choosing A1
- p2 = probability of choosing A2 = 1 - p0 - p1

We are to find the optimal p0, p1, p2 (summing to 100) to maximize your expected payoff.

But the outcome depends on the **other player’s strategy too**. However, since this is a decision-making game with **no communication**, and you don’t know the other player’s strategy, you must assume they are rational and may also be optimizing.

So, we need to look for **Nash Equilibrium** in this extended game.

But the problem says: **You are to maximize your total points**, and to "choose a probability distribution", implying you are to pick a strategy **best response** to the likely behavior of the other player.

But since the other player is also rational and wants to maximize their own payoff, we can try to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium or analyze best responses.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and symmetric in their reasoning.

Let’s try to analyze the possible equilibria.

---

### Step 4: Possible equilibria under delegation

Let’s suppose both players use the same mixed strategy. Because the game is symmetric — the payoffs are symmetric in structure (though not identical, due to the mediator’s behavior), let’s see if a symmetric equilibrium exists.

Let’s suppose **both players** use the same strategy: (p0, p1, p2).

Then we can compute the expected payoff for each player.

But let’s instead first analyze if **delegation can improve your payoff**.

Let’s consider some candidate behaviors.

---

### Step 5: Try to find dominant behavior

Let’s suppose the other player is also rational and will choose optimally.

Let’s analyze what the other player might do.

Note: The mediator only acts based on **how many** delegate. So if both players delegate, both get A0.

If only one delegates, the mediator plays A1.

So the key is coordinating delegation.

Let’s consider the potential outcomes.

#### Case 1: Neither player delegates
- You choose A0 or A1 with probabilities p0, p1.
- Other player chooses A0 or A1 with q0, q1.
- You get expected payoff based on standard game.

#### Case 2: You delegate, other does not
- Mediator plays A1 → your action is A1.
- Other plays A0 or A1.
- So your payoff depends on their action.

#### Case 3: You do not delegate, other delegates
- Mediator plays A1 → other's action is A1.
- You play A0 or A1.
- You get payoff based on your choice vs A1.

#### Case 4: Both delegate
- Mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → payoff: (10, 10)

So **if both delegate, both get 10**.

This is a **very good outcome** for both, especially compared to if you both play A1 (get only 4).

Is 10,10 better than other outcomes?

Let’s compare to the Nash equilibrium of the base game.

---

### Step 6: Nash equilibrium of base game (no delegation)

The base game without delegation:

|         | A0 | A1 |
|---------|----|----|
| **A0**  | 10,10 | 0,20 |
| **A1**  | 6,2  | 4,4 |

Let’s find the mixed Nash equilibrium.

Let Player 2 (opponent) play A0 with probability q, A1 with 1−q.

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 10q + 0(1−q) = 10q
- If you play A1: 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Set equal for indifference:
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So if opponent plays A0 with 0.5, you are indifferent.

Now, opponent’s payoff:
- If they play A0: 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- If they play A1: 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → −8p = 2 → p = −0.25 → impossible.

So no mixed strategy equilibrium? Wait.

Wait: the indifference condition for opponent must be that they are indifferent between A0 and A1 given your p.

But if p = 0 (you always play A0), opponent’s payoff:
- A0: 10 (vs your A0)
- A1: 20 (vs your A0) → so they prefer A1.

If p = 1 (you always play A1), opponent:
- A0: 2 (vs your A1)
- A1: 4 → prefers A1.

So opponent **always prefers A1**, regardless of your action.

Similarly, for you:
- If opponent plays A0: you get 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefer A0.
- If opponent plays A1: you get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A1.

So you are indifferent only if opponent mixes at q = 0.5.

But opponent has no incentive to mix: **A1 is strictly dominant for opponent**!

Because:
- If you play A0: they get 10 vs 20 → prefer A1
- If you play A1: they get 2 vs 4 → prefer A1

So A1 **strictly dominates** A0 for the other player.

Therefore, **in the base game, the other player will play A1 with probability 1**, assuming they are rational.

Then, your best response:
- If they play A1, you get:
  - A0 → 0
  - A1 → 4
→ So you should play A1.

So **the unique Nash equilibrium in the base game is: both play A1 → payoff (4,4)**.

But now, **delegation option exists**, so things change.

---

### Step 7: With delegation, can we do better?

Recall: if **both players delegate**, mediator plays A0 → both get **10**, which is better than 4.

So if you can coordinate both to delegate, you both get 10.

But neither player has incentive to delegate **if the other doesn't**, because:
- If you delegate and other doesn’t: mediator plays A1 → your action is A1.
- Other player plays A1 (since A1 dominates) → so you get A1 vs A1 → 4 points.
- But if you had just played A1 yourself, you’d also get 4.

So same outcome.

But if you delegate and the other **does not**, you get 4, same as if you played A1.

Wait: what if other plays A0?

But the other player has **no incentive to play A0**, because:
- If you play A0: they get 10 vs 20 → prefer A1
- If you play A1: they get 2 vs 4 → prefer A1

So as established, **the other player will always play A1** unless delegation changes incentives.

But **if the other player delegates**, then their action becomes A1 (if only one delegates) or A0 (if both delegate).

Let’s see.

Suppose **you do not delegate**, and **the other player delegates**.

Then:
- Only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → **other player’s action is A1**
- You play A0 or A1
- So again, other plays A1.

So no difference.

Now, suppose **both delegate**:
- Mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you both get 10.

So if you can get both to delegate, you get 10.

But the **other player** might not want to delegate unless it's better.

Let’s analyze incentives.

---

### Step 8: Suppose you choose to delegate (A2)

Then your action becomes:
- A1 if only you delegate
- A0 if both delegate

So your expected outcome depends on the other player’s choice.

Let’s suppose the other player is rational and wants to maximize their payoff.

What should they do?

Let’s assume you choose to delegate with probability p2.

Then the other player considers:
- If they do **not delegate**, then:
  - If you delegate (prob p2): only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → their action is A1 → you play A1.
  - So: you play A1, they play A1 → payoff (4,4)

  - If you do **not** delegate (prob 1−p2): neither delegate → so they can choose A0 or A1.

Now, if neither delegates, their best response: A1 (since dominates), and you play A1 → (4,4)

So in **both cases**, if they don't delegate, they get 4.

Now, suppose **they delegate**.

Then:
- If you delegate: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → they get 10.
- If you do not delegate: only them delegate → mediator plays A1 → their action is A1 → you play A0 or A1 (say you play A1) → they get 4 (if you play A1) or 20 (if you play A0)

But they don’t know what you play.

Wait: we need to model their belief about your strategy.

But since you are rational and want to maximize your own payoff, you’ll choose a strategy that is optimal.

Let’s suppose **you commit to a strategy where you always delegate**.

Then:
- If the other player does **not delegate**: you delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → your action is A1 → other plays A1 → you both get (4,4)
- If the other player **delegates**: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you both get (10,10)

So for the other player:
- If they do not delegate: get 4
- If they delegate: get 10

→ So they **prefer to delegate**.

Thus, **if you delegate with probability 1**, then the other player will also delegate (since 10 > 4), resulting in (10,10).

So your payoff is 10.

Compare to original: 4.

So much better.

But can you do even better?

Wait: the other player would not want to deviate — they get 10, which is best possible for them in this setup.

So (both delegate) is a Nash equilibrium if **both play A2**.

Let’s check:

If both players play A2 (delegate), then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → payoff (10,10)

Now, can a player deviate?

Suppose you deviate to A1:
- You play A1, other plays A0 (due to delegation) → so you get 6, other gets 2.
→ You get 6 < 10 → worse.

If you deviate to A0:
- You play A0, other plays A0 → you get 10, same as before → not worse.

But you could be indifferent, but since you get same payoff, no incentive to deviate.

But actually: if you deviate to A0, and other still delegates → mediator plays A0 → other player plays A0 → you play A0 → (10,10) → same.

So you get 10 either way.

But if you play A0, your action is A0; if you play A1, you still get 6.

But your **payoff** is 10 in both cases? No.

Wait: if you **choose** A0, and other player delegates → their action is A0 → you get 10.

If you **choose** A1, and other plays A0 → you get 6.

So **by switching to A1**, you get 6 < 10 → worse.

So deviating to A1 hurts you.

Deviation to A0 gives same 10.

So no profitable deviation.

Similarly, the other player has no incentive to deviate.

So **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**.

Payoff: (10,10)

Now, is there a better equilibrium for you?

Can you get more than 10?

Maximum possible payoff is 10, when you play A0 and other plays A0 → 10.

So 10 is maximum.

So (10,10) is best possible.

Now, is this the only equilibrium?

Suppose both players play A1.

Then: neither delegates → both play A1 → (4,4)

Each can deviate to A2 (delegate): then, only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → their action becomes A1 → same as before → they get 4.

But if they delegate, and you don't: they get A1 (from mediator), you play A1 → (4,4)

Same.

But if both play A2, they get 10.

So both better off with A2.

So (A2,A2) is better.

Another possibility: suppose you use a mixed strategy.

But if you can achieve 10 by playing A2 with 100%, and the other player rationally responds by playing A2, then you get 10.

Now, **can you get more than 10?** No.

So if you can induce the other player to delegate, you can get 10.

But what if you are unsure whether the other player will delegate?

Suppose you play a mix.

Let’s suppose you play:

- A2 with probability x
- A0 with probability 1−x
- A1 with probability 0

(We can try simpler strategies.)

Suppose you play A2 with probability x, A0 with 1−x.

Then the other player’s best response?

They consider:
- Not delegate: then their action is their own choice.
- But they know you are playing A2 with prob x, A0 with 1−x.

If they **do not delegate**, then:
- With prob x: you delegate → mediator plays A1 → your action is A1
  → their action: A0 or A1
  → they should play A1 → get 4 (if you play A1)
- With prob 1−x: you play A0 → if they play A1, they get 20 (because you play A0)
  → so they want to play A1 in both subcases.

So best response: play A1 if not delegate.

Then, if they play A1, and you do not delegate (A0), they get 20.

But if they delegate?

- With prob x: you delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → their action is A0 → you play A0 → both get 10

- With prob 1−x: you don't delegate → only they delegate → mediator plays A1 → their action is A1 → you play A0 → so they play A1, you play A0 → they get 20

Now, compute expected payoff from **delegating**:

= x * 10 + (1−x) * 20 = 10x + 20 − 20x = 20 − 10x

Payoff from **not delegating and playing A1**:

= x * (payoff when you delegate and they play A1) + (1−x) * (payoff when you play A0 and they play A1)

= x * 4 + (1−x) * 20 = 4x + 20 − 20x = 20 − 16x

Now, compare:
- Delegation: 20 − 10x
- Not delegation: 20 − 16x

Since 20 − 10x > 20 − 16x for all x > 0, **delegation is better** for them.

Even at x=0: both give 20.

So if x > 0, delegation gives higher payoff.

If x=0: then not delegating gives 20, delegating gives 20 → same.

So **if x > 0**, they prefer to delegate.

If x=0, they are indifferent.

But if x>0, they strictly prefer to delegate → so they will delegate.

So if you play A2 with **any positive probability**, the other player will prefer to delegate (unless x=0).

And if x=0, they might not.

But suppose x=0: you play A0 with 100%.

Then:
- If they don’t delegate: you play A0 → so if they play A1, they get 20 → so they play A1 → payoff 20
- If they delegate: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → their action is A1 → you play A0 → they get 20 → same

So indifferent.

So they might play A1 or delegate.

But if they delegate, you get only 0? No: you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0.

But you want to avoid that.

So if you play A0 with 100%, and they play A1, you get 0.

Bad.

So you don’t want that.

So to increase your payoff, you need to **induce** them to delegate.

And that happens if you play A2 with **positive probability**.

But if you play A2 with small probability, they still prefer to delegate (since 20−10x > 20−16x for x>0), so they will delegate.

Then, if they delegate, and you play A2 → both delegate → you play A0 → get 10

If you play A0 → you play A0 → get 10

If you play A1 → you play A1 → get 6? No: if they delegate, your action depends on what you do.

Wait: if they delegate, their action is A0 or A1 depending on number of delegates.

But if **you play A0**, and they delegate: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → their action is A1 → you play A0 → you get 0.

So if they delegate, and you play A0 → you get 0.

If they delegate, and you play A1 → you get 4 (since you play A1, they play A1 → 4)

If they delegate, and you play A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 10

Ah! Important!

So **only if you delegate**, and both delegate, you get 10.

If you don’t delegate, and they do, then you play A0 or A1 vs their A1 → you get 0 or 4.

So to get 10, **you must delegate**.

So if you want to get 10, you must **delegate**.

But if you delegate, you may or may not be paired with a delegate.

But earlier: if you delegate with any probability x > 0, the other player will **want to delegate** because 20−10x > 20−16x.

So they will delegate.

Then, when they delegate, your action:
- If you play A2 → both delegate → you play A0 → get 10
- If you play A0 → you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 → you play A1, they play A1 → you get 4

So to maximize payoff **when they are delegating**, you must play A2 → get 10.

So if you play A2 with positive probability, they will delegate, and you get 10 when you play A2.

But if you play A0 or A1 when they are delegating, you get less.

So you want to play A2 whenever possible.

So the optimal strategy is to play A2 with 100%.

Then, as shown earlier, other player gets 10 if they delegate, 4 if not → so they will delegate.

Then both delegate → both get 10.

So you get 10.

Any deviation from A2 gives you less.

For example:
- Play A0 with 100%: then they may not delegate, and if not, they play A1, you play A0 → get 0.
- Even if they delegate, you get 0 (since you're not delegating, only they are → they play A1).

So much worse.

Similarly for A1.

So **the optimal strategy is to play A2 (Delegate) with probability 100%**.

Then:
- Other player, facing you with 100% A2, will delegate (since it gives them 10, better than 4 if they don’t).

- So both delegate → you both play A0 → you get 10.

This is a Nash equilibrium.

And you get 10, which is the maximum possible.

No other strategy gives more than 10.

So this is optimal.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To maximize the total points in this game, let's analyze the payoff matrix and the impact of the mediator (A2).

### 1. The Original Game (A0, A1)
The payoff matrix for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2) is:
| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **A1** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) |

For Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 20 (A1) or 10 (A0).
- If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 4 (A1) or 2 (A0).
Action **A1** strictly dominates **A0** for Player 2.

For Player 1:
- If Player 2 plays their dominant strategy (A1), Player 1's best response is A1 (getting 4 instead of 0).
The Nash Equilibrium of the basic game is (A1, A1), resulting in a payoff of **(4, 4)**.

### 2. Including the Mediator (A2)
The mediator (A2) follows these rules:
- One player delegates: Mediator plays A1.
- Both players delegate: Mediator plays A0.

The payoff matrix becomes 3x3:
| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) | (0, 20) |
| **A1** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (4, 4) |
| **A2** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (10, 10) |

### 3. Strategy Evaluation
For Player 2 (me):
- If P1 plays A0: A1 and A2 give 20, A0 gives 10.
- If P1 plays A1: A1 and A2 give 4, A0 gives 2.
- If P1 plays A2: A2 gives 10, A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2.
Action **A2** weakly dominates **A1** and strongly dominates **A0**. It is always at least as good as any other action and significantly better if the other player also chooses to delegate.

For Player 1:
- If P1 knows P2 is rational and will avoid the dominated action A0, P1 only needs to consider P2 playing A1 or A2.
- Against A1 or A2, P1's best response is also **A2**, as it yields 10 against A2 (instead of 4 or 0).

### 4. Conclusion
By both players choosing A2, the mediator plays A0 for both, resulting in the maximum possible mutual payoff of 10. This is the payoff-dominant Nash Equilibrium and is supported by weak dominance. Therefore, delegating to the mediator is the most robust strategy to maximize total points.

response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff structure

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

From Player 2's perspective:
- (A0, A0): They get 10
- (A0, A1): They get 20
- (A1, A0): They get 2
- (A1, A1): They get 4

## Step 2: Analyze the delegation mechanism

The mediator behaves as follows:
- If only 1 player delegates → plays A0 for that player
- If both players delegate → plays A1 for both players

## Step 3: Determine Player 2's best strategy

Let me check what Player 2 gets against each of my possible actions:

**If I play A0:**
- Player 2 plays A0: they get 10
- Player 2 plays A1: they get 20 ✓ (best)
- Player 2 delegates: they get 10

**If I play A1:**
- Player 2 plays A0: they get 2
- Player 2 plays A1: they get 4 ✓ (best)
- Player 2 delegates: they get 2

**If I delegate (getting A0):**
- Player 2 plays A0: they get 10
- Player 2 plays A1: they get 20 ✓ (best)
- Player 2 delegates: they get 4

**Conclusion:** A1 strictly dominates all other strategies for Player 2. They should always play A1.

## Step 4: Determine my best response

Given that Player 2 will rationally play A1:
- If I play A0: I get 0
- If I play A1: I get 4 ✓ (best)
- If I delegate (getting A0): I get 0

**Conclusion:** Against Player 2's A1, my best response is A1.

## Step 5: Verify Nash Equilibrium

At (A1, A1):
- I get 4; deviating to A0 or delegating gives me 0 → no incentive to deviate
- They get 4; deviating to A0 or delegating gives them 2 → no incentive to deviate

This is a Nash equilibrium.

## Final Answer

Since (A1, A1) is the unique Nash equilibrium and maximizes my expected payoff given rational play by Player 2, I should play A1 with certainty.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to find the optimal strategy for **Player 1** under the new rules involving delegation.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Original Game (without delegation)**

We are playing a 2-player game where each player chooses A0 or A1, and the payoffs are:

| Your Choice \ Other's Choice | A0 (Other) | A1 (Other) |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | 10, 10     | 0, 20      |
| **A1**                        | 6, 2       | 4, 4       |

This is a **simultaneous-move game**, and we want to find the best **mixed strategy** for Player 1 to maximize expected payoff.

But now there’s a **new twist**: we can **delegate** our choice to a **mediator** by choosing **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator’s Behavior**

The mediator behaves based on **how many players have delegated**:

- If **only one player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **both players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So the mediator is **not neutral**, and its action **depends on the number of delegators**.

Crucially:
- The mediator **does not observe the other player's choice**.
- It only sees **how many players have chosen to delegate**.
- Therefore, **your decision to delegate affects what the mediator does**, but also **affects the other player's incentives** because the mediator's action depends on total delegation.

So this is a **strategic interaction** about whether to delegate.

Note: You are Player 1. You decide whether to delegate, and **the other player** will also decide whether to delegate (or not), but you don’t know their choice until both are committed.

---

### **Step 3: Define the Possible Actions**

You can choose:
- **A0**: Play A0 yourself
- **A1**: Play A1 yourself
- **A2**: Delegate to the mediator

Let your strategy be:  
- $ p_0 $ = probability of choosing A0  
- $ p_1 $ = probability of choosing A1  
- $ p_2 $ = probability of choosing A2  

And $ p_0 + p_1 + p_2 = 100 $

Similarly, the other player chooses a strategy: $ q_0, q_1, q_2 $ with $ q_0 + q_1 + q_2 = 100 $

But **you don’t know** the other player's strategy, so you need to assume they are rational and may play optimally too.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies, including delegation.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Delegation as a Strategic Tool**

Let’s analyze what happens in different delegation scenarios.

---

#### **Case 1: You delegate (A2), Other does NOT delegate**

- Delegation count = 1 → mediator plays **A1**
- So you play A1 (via mediator)
- Other plays A0 or A1 based on their own choice

So your outcome depends on their choice.

- If other chooses A0: You play A1, other plays A0 → payoffs: **You: 6, Other: 2**
- If other chooses A1: You play A1, other plays A1 → payoffs: **You: 4, Other: 4**

But you don’t know what they choose. But we can compute expected payoff based on their strategy.

---

#### **Case 2: You **do not** delegate, Other delegates**

- Delegation count = 1 → mediator plays **A1**
- So other plays A1 (via mediator)
- You play A0 or A1

So outcomes:
- If you play A0: You get 0, other gets 20
- If you play A1: You get 4, other gets 4

So you get **0 or 4**, depending on your action.

---

#### **Case 3: Both delegate**

- Delegation count = 2 → mediator plays **A0**
- So you play A0, other plays A0
- Payoffs: **10, 10**

So if both delegate, you get 10.

---

#### **Case 4: Neither delegates**

Then it’s the original game: both choose A0 or A1 based on their mixed strategy.

---

So the key insight is: **if both delegate, you both get 10** – a highly desirable outcome for both.

But if only one delegates, the mediator plays **A1**, so the delegator plays A1, and the non-delegator can exploit that.

Let’s now evaluate what a rational player would do.

---

### **Step 5: Consider Possible Equilibria**

Let’s consider **symmetric equilibria** — what if both players use the same strategy?

Suppose we look for a symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both players use the same $ p_0, p_1, p_2 $.

But let's look for a **simple equilibrium**: both players **always delegate**.

Try: **Both players choose A2 with probability 100**

Then:
- Delegation count = 2 → mediator plays A0
- Both play A0
- Payoffs: 10, 10

Now, is this stable?

Suppose you **deviate** and instead play A1 (not delegate), while other still delegates.

Then:
- Delegation count = 1 → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1
- You play A1 → both A1 → payoffs: 4, 4

You get 4, but you would have gotten **10** if you had stayed delegated.

So you **lose 6 points** — not worth it.

Now suppose you **deviate by not delegating and playing A0** while other delegates.

Then:
- Delegation count = 1 → other plays A1
- You play A0 → you get **0**, other gets 20

You go from 10 to 0 → **worse**

So **no incentive to deviate** from delegating if the other player always delegates.

Similarly, if the other player always delegates, you get:
- If you delegate → you get 10
- If you play A0 → you get 0
- If you play A1 → you get 4

So best response is: **delegate** → get 10.

So if the other player **always delegates**, then **your best response is to delegate**.

So **(A2, A2)** — both delegate — is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Now, is it the **only** one?

Let’s check: could there be an equilibrium where no one delegates?

Suppose both play only A0 and A1.

We can solve for the mixed strategy equilibrium in the original game.

Let’s compute the **mixed strategy equilibrium without delegation**.

Let:
- You play A0 with prob $ p $, A1 with $ 1-p $
- Other plays A0 with prob $ q $, A1 with $ 1-q $

Your expected payoff:

- If you play A0: $ 10q + 0(1-q) = 10q $
- If you play A1: $ 6q + 4(1-q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

Set equal for indifference: $ 10q = 2q + 4 $ → $ 8q = 4 $ → $ q = 0.5 $

Similarly, other’s payoff:
- A0: $ 10p + 20(1-p) = 10p + 20 - 20p = 20 - 10p $
- A1: $ 2p + 4(1-p) = 2p + 4 - 4p = 4 - 2p $

Set equal: $ 20 - 10p = 4 - 2p $ → $ 16 = 8p $ → $ p = 2 $

Wait — $ p = 2 $? That’s a mistake.

Wait: 20 - 10p = 4 - 2p  
20 - 4 = 10p - 2p → 16 = 8p → p = 2? No, p = 16/8 = 2? That’s impossible.

Wait: 20 - 10p = 4 - 2p  
Bring all to one side:  
20 - 10p - 4 + 2p = 0 → 16 - 8p = 0 → p = 2 → impossible.

Wait — this suggests **no mixed equilibrium**? That can't be.

Wait — let's double-check.

Payoffs for other player:
- If they play A0: both get 10 if you play A0, 20 if you play A1 → so: $ 10p + 20(1-p) = 10p + 20 - 20p = 20 - 10p $
- If they play A1: you play A0 → they get 20, you play A1 → they get 4 → so: $ 20p + 4(1-p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4 $

Set equal:  
$ 20 - 10p = 16p + 4 $  
20 - 4 = 16p + 10p → 16 = 26p → p = 16/26 ≈ 0.615

Yes! I made a mistake earlier: payoffs when other plays A1 are **20 if you play A0**, **4 if you play A1**, so expected payoff is $ 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4 $

So set:
$ 20 - 10p = 16p + 4 $
→ $ 20 - 4 = 16p + 10p $
→ $ 16 = 26p $
→ $ p = 16/26 ≈ 0.6154 $

So for **other player** to be indifferent, you must play A0 with prob ≈ 61.54%

Similarly, earlier: for you to be indifferent, other must play A0 with probability such that:

Your payoff from A0: 10q  
Your payoff from A1: 2q + 4

Set equal: 10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So in the **original game**, the mixed strategy equilibrium is:
- You play A0 with 50%, A1 with 50%
- Other plays A0 with 61.54%, A1 with 38.46%

Your expected payoff:  
- From A0: 10 * 0.5 = 5  
- From A1: 2*(0.5) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 → so 5

So **expected payoff without delegation is 5**, in equilibrium.

But now, with delegation available, we already found an equilibrium where **both delegate** and get **10 each**.

So clearly, **10 > 5**, so players prefer to delegate.

Moreover, in the (A2, A2) equilibrium, **no one has an incentive to deviate**.

As we checked earlier:
- If you deviate while other still delegates → you get at most 4 (if you play A1), or 0 (if you play A0)
- But if you delegate, you get 10

So **you won’t deviate**

Thus, (delegating, delegating) is a **strict Nash equilibrium**, and gives **10 points**, much better than the original 5.

But is there any other equilibrium?

Suppose both players sometimes delegate, but not always?

But if there’s any uncertainty, then **you risk being the only one who delegates**, in which case the mediator plays A1, so you end up playing A1, while the other might play A0, giving you only 6 or 4.

But if other is random, you might do worse.

Alternatively, suppose both players **randomize** between A0, A1, and A2.

Would that give higher payoff?

Let’s suppose one player uses a mixed strategy including delegation.

But the key point: **if both players follow the delegation equilibrium, each gets 10**, and **no incentive to unilaterally deviate**.

So it’s a **stable equilibrium**.

Now, is there a better one?

Suppose one player always delegates, the other plays a mixed strategy.

But let’s suppose the other player is **rational and best responds**.

Suppose you **always delegate** (p2 = 100).

Then:
- If other does not delegate, they know you are playing A1 (via mediator)
  - So their best reply: if you play A1, they get:
    - A0: 2 points
    - A1: 4 points
  → so best to play A1 → get 4

- If other **delegates**, then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 10, they get 10

So if you delegate, the other player compares:
- If they play A1 (no delegation): they get 4
- If they delegate: they get 10

So **best to delegate**.

So if you delegate, other’s best response is to **delegate**.

So we again come back to **both delegating**.

Thus, **(A2, A2)** is a **stable equilibrium**.

And it yields **10 points**.

Now, could you do better by **mixing**?

Suppose you mix A2 with something else?

But if you ever play A0 or A1, you risk getting less than 10.

Suppose you play A2 with 99%, A1 with 1%.

Then:
- With 99% chance: you delegate → if other delegates, you get 10
- With 1% chance: you play A1

Now, if the other player is also rational and plays A2 always (we are in equilibrium), then:

- When you delegate → both play A0 → you get 10
- When you play A1 → other plays A0 (since they delegate) → you get **6**

So your expected payoff:  
0.99 × 10 + 0.01 × 6 = 9.9 + 0.06 = 9.96 < 10

So **worse than always delegating**

Similarly, if you ever deviate from A2, your expected payoff **goes down**.

Therefore, **no incentive to mix**.

Similarly, if you play A0 or A1 with positive probability, and the other player is delegating, you get less.

Therefore, **the best strategy is to delegate with probability 100%**

And since we are assuming the other player is also rational, they will do the same.

---

### **Step 6: Is there a risk of other player not committing to delegate?**

We must be careful: in game theory, we assume both players are rational and best-respond.

So if you delegate, and they know it, they **will** delegate as well — because it gives them 10 vs. 4 in best case.

But suppose the other player thinks **you won’t delegate**?

But then they get less.

So if both players are rational, they will **both choose to delegate**.

Thus, **(A2, A2)** is the **unique symmetric equilibrium** and gives the highest payoff.

---

### **Step 7: Final Strategy**

You should **always delegate** to the mediator.

- So: A2 → 100
- A0 → 0
- A1 → 0

This maximizes your expected payoff at **10**, and is stable against deviations.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)

We are Player 1 in a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

|               | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0**     | (10,10) | (0,20) |
| **P1 A1**     | (6,2)   | (4,4)  |

This is a classic coordination/battle of the sexes type game with asymmetric payoffs.

Let’s analyze the incentives:

- If P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 (10 > 20? no — wait, check: P2 gets 10 vs 20, so P2 prefers A1 if P1 plays A0).
  - So if P1 plays A0, P2’s best response is A1 → outcome (0,20)
- If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 2 (if A0) vs 4 (if A1) → so P2 prefers A1 → outcome (4,4)
- If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → P1 prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → P1 prefers A1

So:
- P1's best responses:
  - If P2 plays A0 → choose A0
  - If P2 plays A1 → choose A1
- P2's best responses:
  - If P1 plays A0 → choose A1
  - If P1 plays A1 → choose A1

So P2 always prefers A1 regardless of what P1 does.

P1's optimal strategy depends on beliefs about P2.

But now, the twist: **We can delegate our move to a mediator**, and there's an **approval voting process** to choose which mediator will be used (the one with the most approvals, and if multiple, chosen uniformly at random).

---

### Step 2: Understand the Mediators

Both mediators are identical:

- **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**:
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

- **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**:
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **Both M1 and M2 have identical behavior.**

So there is **no difference** between the two mediators in terms of action selection. They behave identically under both delegation counts.

Therefore, **both mediators are functionally equivalent.**

---

### Step 3: Should You Approve a Mediator?

You are to approve mediators via **approval voting**. The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random** from the set of mediators with the **maximum number of approvals**.

Your goal: **maximize your expected points**.

So your approval decision affects:
- Whether a mediator is eligible to win
- The probability that a particular mediator (or type) ends up being used
- But since both M1 and M2 are identical, it doesn't matter which one wins.

Thus, **if you approve both**, then both have 1 approval (assuming no one else votes), so winner is random — but since they're identical, it doesn't matter.

If you approve only one, and the other gets 0, then that one wins.

But since both behave identically, it makes no difference **which one wins**.

So should you approve both?

**Yes, because:**
- Approving a mediator increases its chance of being selected (if it gets enough approvals).
- Since there’s a randomness in selecting the winner from the max-approved set, and you want to **maximize your expected payoff**, you need to consider what happens **if** the mediator is used.

But here’s the key: **you don’t know how many players will delegate**, or whether the mediator will be used at all.

But you’re choosing the **approval** phase **before** any delegation decisions.

Let’s consider your options.

---

### Step 4: Consider Your Delegation Strategy (Indirectly)

The outcome depends on:
- Whether you delegate or not
- Whether the other player delegates or not
- Which mediator ends up being used (if any)

But since the mediators are identical, you don’t care which one wins.

So your approval decision is about ensuring that a **mediator with the correct behavior** is available.

But both are the same.

So you should **approve both**, because:
- That ensures that **if the mediator is chosen**, it will act as specified under both 1 or 2 delegations.
- If you only approve one, and the other gets more approvals (from others), then only that one can win, but since they are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But suppose someone else may approve only one of them.

But we are only concerned with **your** approval decisions.

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, so you should **maximize the chance** that the **correct mediator** is used — but since both work identically, **any mediator that behaves as described is fine**.

Now: **What happens if no mediator is approved by anyone?**

Then the mediator mechanism isn't used, and we play the base game.

But the problem says: "**you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator**", implying that **if a mediator is selected**, then you can delegate.

But the **approval voting** happens first — so if no mediator is approved by anyone (or even one), you still **may or may not** use mediation.

But the game structure is: **the winning mediator is selected based on approvals**, and then **you can delegate or not**.

So if no mediator is approved, then **no mediator exists**, so delegation is not possible.

So if you approve **both**, you increase the chance that **a mediator exists**, and one gets selected.

If you approve **only one**, same thing — as long as someone else also approves it, it can win.

But if you **approve neither**, then no mediator can win, because even if others approve, you didn’t, but **your approval is one vote**.

But the problem says: **"The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."**

So if you approve **neither**, but others approve M1 and M2, then:
- M1 has 1
- M2 has 1
- max = 1
- winner is chosen uniformly at random from M1 and M2 → one is selected → mediation happens

So even if you don't approve any, **as long as others do**, a mediator can be selected.

But **if you approve neither, and others approve neither**, then no mediator is selected.

But since we are only deciding **your** approvals, we should assume others may approve or not, but **your goal is to maximize your own expected payoff**, so you must consider **all possible scenarios**.

But since you don't know others' behavior, and you're only choosing your own approvals, you must pick the strategy that gives the **best worst-case or expected outcome**.

But here's the key: **if a mediator is selected, you can choose to delegate or not**.

But the **mediator's action** depends on **how many players delegate to it**.

So the **structure is sequential**:
1. Approval voting: you vote on which mediators to approve.
2. Winner is selected (if any).
3. Then, you and the other player decide whether to delegate or act independently.

You can choose whether to delegate **after** seeing which mediator is selected.

So you have adaptive behavior.

So you can decide: **if the mediator is selected, should I delegate or not?**

This is crucial.

---

### Step 5: Analyze the Mediator's Behavior

Let’s denote:
- If **1 person** delegates to the mediator → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 people** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So the mediator's action **depends on delegation count**.

Suppose the mediator is selected. Then you and the other player can choose to delegate or not.

So possible scenarios:

#### Case 1: You delegate, other does not
→ 1 delegation → mediator plays A1 → you play A1

You get: depends on other player's action (which is independent)

- Other player is acting independently → they choose A0 or A1
- You are playing A1 (via mediator)

So outcome:
- If other plays A0 → you get 6
- If other plays A1 → you get 4

But you can choose your action based on belief.

But since you know the rules, you can reason about best response.

#### Case 2: You don't delegate, other does
→ 1 delegation → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1

You play independently → you choose A0 or A1

So:
- If you play A0: (A0, A1) → you get 0
- If you play A1: (A1, A1) → you get 4

So you prefer to play A1 → get 4 rather than 0.

So if other delegates and you don't, you should play A1.

#### Case 3: Both delegate
→ 2 delegations → mediator plays A0 → both play A0

You get 10

#### Case 4: Neither delegates
→ you play independently, other plays independently

This is the base game.

---

### Step 6: Strategic Considerations

Suppose the mediator is selected.

Now, **you** decide whether to delegate.

You want to maximize your expected payoff.

Let’s consider what happens in each case.

#### Option A: You delegate
Then:
- If other doesn't delegate → 1 delegation → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
  → You face the other player's choice
- If other delegates → 2 delegations → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
  → Outcome is (A0, A0) → you get 10

So your payoff depends on what you expect the other player to do.

But you know that the other player is rational and wants to maximize their points.

Let’s see what **the other player** would do.

#### What would the other player do?

They face a similar decision.

If **they delegate**, then:
- If you don’t delegate → 1 delegation → mediator plays A1 → they play A1
- If you do delegate → 2 delegations → mediator plays A0 → they play A0

So:
- If they delegate and you don’t: they play A1 → their payoff depends on your action
- If they delegate and you do: both play A0 → they get 10

Now let’s suppose both are rational and know the others’ behavior.

Let’s analyze **Nash equilibrium** in this delegation game.

But we are not modeling full equilibrium — we are just trying to decide **if you should approve the mediator**.

But since **you** want to **maximize your expected payoff**, you need to think: **would you benefit from having a mediator available?**

Let’s compare the possible outcomes.

---

### Step 7: Compare Delegation vs Independent Action

Let’s suppose you **do not approve any mediator**.

Then **no mediator exists**, so both players must act independently.

The game has the following equilibria:

- **Pure strategy NE:**
  - (A0, A0): (10,10)
  - (A1, A1): (4,4)
  - Is (A0, A1) a NE? P1 wants to deviate to A1 → from 0 to 4 → yes → not NE
  - (A1, A0): P2 wants to deviate to A1 → from 2 to 10 → yes → not NE

So only pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But (A0,A0) is better for both.

Is there a mixed strategy NE?

Let P1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1−p

P2 plays A0 with q, A1 with 1−q

P1’s payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: 10p + 6(1−p) = 4p + 6
- If P2 plays A1: 0p + 4(1−p) = 4 − 4p

P1 is indifferent when: 4p + 6 = 4 − 4p → 8p = -2 → p = -0.25 → impossible

So no interior mixed equilibrium.

Wait, let's do proper calculation.

P1's expected payoff given P2’s action:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 if A0, 6 if A1 → so best if 10 > 6 → always prefer A0 → best response: p = 1
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 if A0, 4 if A1 → so best to play A1 → p = 0

So P1’s best response:
- if q = P(P2 plays A0) > 0, then P1 plays A0 if q is high, but actually:

P1’s expected payoff from A0: 10q + 0(1−q) = 10q  
From A1: 6q + 4(1−q) = 2q + 4

Set equal: 10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So:
- If q > 0.5 → A0 better
- If q < 0.5 → A1 better
- If q = 0.5 → indifferent

Similarly, for P2:
- A0: 10p + 2(1−p) = 8p + 2
- A1: 20p + 4(1−p) = 16p + 4

Set equal: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → impossible

So P2's best response:
- For any p, compare:
  - A0: 8p + 2
  - A1: 16p + 4
  - Difference: (16p+4) - (8p+2) = 8p + 2 > 0 for all p ≥ 0 → so A1 is always strictly better

So P2 **always** prefers A1, no matter what P1 does.

Thus, P2's dominant strategy is A1.

Then P1, knowing P2 plays A1, should play A1 (since 4 > 0)

So the **unique Nash equilibrium in dominant strategies** is:
- P1: A1
- P2: A1
- Outcome: (4,4)

Even though (10,10) is better for both, there is no incentive for either to deviate unilaterally from (A1,A1), so it's stable.

But (A0,A0) is not a NE because if other plays A0, you can deviate to A1 and get 6 > 0? No — wait:

Wait: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0 → you get 10.

If P1 deviates to A1 → you get 6 → worse.

So (A0,A0) is a NE? Let's check:

- P1: if P2 plays A0 → A0 gives 10, A1 gives 6 → so P1 prefers A0
- P2: if P1 plays A0 → A0 gives 10, A1 gives 20 → so P2 prefers A1

→ So **P2 wants to deviate** → so (A0,A0) is **not** a NE.

Similarly, (A1,A1): P1 gets 4, A0 gives 0 → so P1 has no incentive to deviate; P2 gets 4, A0 gives 2 → no incentive → so (A1,A1) **is** a NE.

(A0,A1): P1 gets 0, A1 gives 4 → wants to deviate → not NE
(A1,A0): P2 gets 2, A1 gives 4 → wants to deviate → not NE

So the **only Nash equilibrium** is (A1,A1) → both get 4.

So in the base game, with **no mediator**, and assuming rational players, the outcome is (A1,A1) → you get 4.

Now, what if a **mediator is available**?

You can now **choose to delegate**.

Suppose a mediator is selected (and you get to play against the other player, who may delegate or not).

Let’s suppose you consider **delegating**.

Your action is determined by the mediator, which depends on **how many delegate**.

Let’s suppose you are rational and want to maximize your payoff.

Can you do better than 4?

Let’s consider: **can you achieve (A0,A0)?** That gives you 10.

Yes, if **both delegate**, then mediator plays **A0**, so both play A0 → (10,10)

So **if both delegate**, you get 10 — much better than 4.

But can you **coordinate** this?

You need both to delegate.

But the other player may not want to delegate, or may not know your choice.

But since you can **observe the outcome of approval voting**, and **then decide** whether to delegate, you can react.

So suppose the mediator is selected.

Now, you can decide: **do I delegate?**

Your decision affects the mediator action.

Let’s suppose you **expect the other player** to act rationally.

But their decision depends on whether **you delegate**, so it’s a coordination game.

Let’s analyze the **delegation game with mediator**.

Suppose mediator is selected.

You and the other player simultaneously decide whether to delegate.

So four possibilities:

1. **You delegate, other does not**
   - Delegation count: 1 → mediator plays A1
   - You: A1
   - Other: plays independently → so they choose A0 or A1
   - Since P2 always prefers A1 (dominant strategy), they play A1
   - So outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4

2. **You do not delegate, other delegates**
   - Delegation count: 1 → mediator plays A1
   - Other: A1
   - You: play independently → you know their action is A1, so you play A1 (to get 4 instead of 0) → so (A1,A1) → you get 4

3. **Both delegate**
   - Delegation count: 2 → mediator plays A0
   - Both play A0 → (10,10) → you get 10

4. **Neither delegates**
   - Back to base game: (A1,A1) → you get 4

So let’s see what happens in each case:

- If both delegate → you get 10 (great)
- If only one delegates → you get 4
- If neither → you get 4

So your payoff is:
- 10 if both delegate
- 4 otherwise

Similarly, the other player:
- 10 if both delegate
- 4 otherwise
→ So both prefer **both delegating**.

But can they coordinate?

It’s a **coordination game**.

The payoff matrix for the delegation decision (you vs other) is:

|                   | Other delegates | Other doesn’t |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **You delegate**  | (10,10)         | (4,4)         |
| **You don’t delegate** | (4,4)         | (4,4)         |

So:
- If you delegate and other delegates → 10
- If you delegate and other doesn't → 4
- If you don't delegate and other does → 4
- If neither → 4

So **both prefer to both delegate**, but if one delegates and the other doesn’t, they get 4, same as if neither does.

So there are **two pure NE**:
- Both delegate → (10,10)
- Neither delegates → (4,4)

Which one will happen?

It’s **ambiguous**.

But note: if you **never delegate**, then both end up with 4.

But if you **are willing to delegate**, and you **expect the other to do the same**, then you can coordinate on (10,10).

But the problem is: **you don’t know** what the other player will do.

But since you **get to choose** after the mediator is selected, and you know the structure, you can choose your action.

Now, **if you believe the other player is rational and will also consider delegation**, then you might **threaten** or **signal**.

But more importantly: **can you guarantee a better outcome by approving the mediator?**

Let’s suppose you **do not** approve any mediator.

Then no mediator exists → you must play independently → outcome is (A1,A1) → you get 4.

Now, suppose you **approve a mediator**.

Then, **if the mediator is selected**, you have the **option to delegate**, and you can **cooperate** with the other player to both delegate → get 10.

But there’s **risk**: if only one delegates, you get only 4.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and the other does, you still get 4.

But if **you delegate**, and the other delegates, you get 10.

So **only if both delegate** do you get 10.

But since you get **10** only if both delegate, and **4** otherwise, your expected payoff depends on the **likelihood** of coordination.

But in the **absence of communication**, coordination is hard.

However, **if you approve a mediator, you can commit to delegating** if you believe the other will do so.

But since the other player is rational, **they will not delegate unless they believe you will too**, because if they delegate and you don’t, they get only 4 (same as not delegating), but they risk being alone.

Let’s think from their perspective.

If **you delegate**, and they delegate → they get 10.

If they delegate and you don’t → they get 4.

If they don’t delegate → they get 4 regardless.

So if they **don’t expect you to delegate**, they get 4 no matter what → so they are indifferent.

But if they **expect you to delegate**, then they get 10 by delegating, 4 by not → so they prefer to delegate.

So **if you delegate, the other player prefers to delegate too**.

But you don’t know.

This is a **game of chicken** or **coordination** with two equilibria.

But you can **strategically** choose to delegate **if you are confident**.

But in practice, **with approval voting**, you have **influence**.

---

### Step 8: Strategy — Should You Approve?

Suppose you **approve both mediators**.

Then:
- The mediator is more likely to be selected (if others approve, it will be selected)
- And since both mediators are identical, it doesn’t matter which one wins

You are not hurting yourself by approving both.

If you **approve only one**, same thing — mediator can still be selected, as long as others approve it.

But suppose you **approve neither**.

Then:
- The mediator is selected only if at least one other person approves a mediator.
- But since you can still **delegate** if a mediator is selected (you only need to not block it), but your **approval affects whether a mediator is eligible**.

But if you **approve neither**, but the other player approves one, then a mediator can still be selected.

So **you can still benefit from delegation**, even if you don’t approve any.

But you don’t **control** the approval.

But since both mediators are identical, you **should not disapprove either**.

Why?

Because:
- If you disapprove both, you **reduce the chance** that a mediator is selected (if others don't approve).
- But even if a mediator is selected, you can still delegate.
- But **you can only benefit if a mediator is selected and you both delegate**.

But if you **disapprove both**, you are **not helping** the mediator be selected.

But if you **approve both**, you are **supporting the possibility of mediation**.

And since mediation **can** lead to (A0,A0) → you get 10, which is better than 4, you want mediation to be possible.

Moreover, **if you approve a mediator**, you are helping ensure that the mechanism is available.

But if you **disapprove both**, and **nobody else approves**, then **no mediator**, so you get 4.

But if you **approve**, then even if others don’t, **your approval counts** → increases chance of mediator being selected.

But the **winning mediator** is selected **only if it has the most approvals**.

So if you approve both, and everyone else approves nothing, then:
- M1: 1 (you)
- M2: 1 (you)
- Max = 1
- Winner: chosen uniformly at random → so a mediator is selected → you can delegate.

So by approving both, you **ensure that even if others don't approve**, a mediator can still be selected.

Whereas if you approve **neither**, and others approve nothing, then **no mediator selected**.

So **by approving both**, you **increase the probability that a mediator is selected**.

Then, **if a mediator is selected**, you can **choose to delegate**, and **if both delegate**, you get 10.

Even if you don’t coordinate, you can **always get at least 4** (same as before), and potentially 10.

So **your minimum payoff is unchanged (4)**, but **you can get 10**.

So **by approving both mediators**, you **enable the possibility of a better outcome**.

But since they are identical, you **gain nothing from choosing one over the other**, and **you gain by supporting mediation**.

Therefore, **you should approve both**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal strategy for **Player 1 (you)** in this decision-making game with the twist of delegation to a mediator.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**
The game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix from **Player 1's perspective** is:

|          | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**   | 10           | 0            |
| **A1**   | 6            | 4            |

So, the payoffs for Player 1:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 0
- (A1, A0): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

Also, the payoffs for Player 2:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 20
- (A1, A0): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

---

### **Step 2: Introduce the Mediator and Delegation (A2)**

You now have an **additional action: A2 = Delegate to Mediator**.

But the mediator’s behavior **depends on how many players delegate to it**, as specified:

- **If only 1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- **If both players** delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

So, the mediator’s behavior is **strategic and outcome-dependent**, not fixed.

But importantly: **You can choose to delegate or not**, and **Player 2 can also choose to delegate or not**.

So the actual outcome depends on the choices of both players.

We are playing a game with **three actions** each: A0, A1, A2.

Let’s define the possible scenarios based on delegation:

---

### **Step 3: Enumerate All Possible Joint Outcomes**

Let’s consider the four combinations of delegation (you and Player 2):

| Your Action | Player 2's Action | Mediator Behavior | Your Final Action | Player 2's Final Action |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| A0          | A0                | Not used         | A0                 | A0                       |
| A0          | A1                | Not used         | A0                 | A1                       |
| A0          | A2 (Delegate)     | Only you → 1 delegate → Mediator plays A1 | A0 | A1 |
| A1          | A0                | Not used         | A1                 | A0                       |
| A1          | A1                | Not used         | A1                 | A1                       |
| A1          | A2                | Only you → 1 delegate → Mediator plays A1 | A1 | A1 |
| A2 (You)    | A0                | Only them → 1 delegate → Mediator plays A1 | A1 | A0 |
| A2 (You)    | A1                | Only them → 1 delegate → Mediator plays A1 | A1 | A1 |
| A2 (You)    | A2 (Delegate)     | Both delegate → 2 delegates → Mediator plays A0 | A0 | A0 |

Let’s clarify the last row: when **both delegate**, the mediator plays **A0** for **both**.

So the **final actions** (what actually happens) are:

- (A0, A0): both play A0
- (A0, A1): you play A0, other plays A1
- (A1, A0): you play A1, other plays A0
- (A1, A1): both play A1

Now we can map the **joint actions (your choice, their choice)** → **actual moves** → **payoffs**.

Let’s compute the **expected payoff** for you based on the four possible combination outcomes.

We'll define:
- Let **p** = your probability of choosing A0
- Let **q** = your probability of choosing A1
- Let **r** = your probability of choosing **A2 (delegate)**

Note: p + q + r = 1

Similarly, let’s assume **Player 2** chooses:
- s = P(they play A0)
- t = P(they play A1)
- u = P(they play A2)
- s + t + u = 1

But since we don’t know Player 2’s strategy, and we are trying to find an optimal **your strategy**, we need to assume **rational behavior** on both sides.

This is a **game with multiple equilibria**, but we’re told to **maximize our expected payoff**, so we should find a **best response** or **Nash equilibrium** approach where we assume both players play optimally.

However, we are allowed to **choose a mixed strategy** that is **best for us**, assuming the other player also acts rationally.

But to do this properly, we need to consider possible **equilibria**.

Alternatively, since this is a **one-shot game** and we are to pick a **mixed strategy**, and the goal is **to maximize expected payoff**, we can try to **guess** or **analyze** the best strategy.

Let’s simplify.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Possible Outcomes Based on Delegation**

Let’s compute payoff for you in each case (based on your choice and Player 2's choice), using the mediator logic.

| Your Choice | Player 2's Choice | Final Actions | Your Payoff |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| A0          | A0                | (A0, A0)       | 10          |
| A0          | A1                | (A0, A1)       | 0           |
| A0          | A2                | (A0, A1)       | 0           |
| A1          | A0                | (A1, A0)       | 6           |
| A1          | A1                | (A1, A1)       | 4           |
| A1          | A2                | (A1, A1)       | 4           |
| A2          | A0                | (A1, A0)       | 6           |
| A2          | A1                | (A1, A1)       | 4           |
| A2          | A2                | (A0, A0)       | 10          |

So let's summarize the **payoff to you** based on the combination:

- (A0, A0) → 10
- (A0, A1) → 0
- (A0, A2) → 0
- (A1, A0) → 6
- (A1, A1) → 4
- (A1, A2) → 4
- (A2, A0) → 6
- (A2, A1) → 4
- (A2, A2) → 10

Now, suppose we assume that **Player 2 is rational and will also try to maximize their own payoff**.

So we want to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

Let’s consider possible strategies.

---

### **Step 5: Try to Find a Symmetric Equilibrium?**

But it’s not symmetric: the payoff structure is asymmetric (you get more in (A0,A0), but Player 2 gets more in (A0,A1)).

Let’s try to see what happens if **both players delegate**.

If both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → (A0,A0) → you get 10, Player 2 gets 10.

But if only **one** delegates → mediator plays A1 → that player gets A1.

So if you delegate and Player 2 doesn’t, you get A1, they get A0 → you get 6.

If you delegate and they do too → you both get A0 → you get 10.

So **delegating is only beneficial if both delegate**.

But if you delegate, and they **don’t**, you get A1, which is worse than A0 (you get 6 instead of 10), but better than getting 0.

But let’s think from **your perspective**.

Suppose **Player 2 plays A2 (delegate)** with some probability.

You want to choose your action to **maximize** expected payoff.

Let’s assume **Player 2 is rational** and will play a best response to your strategy.

But we are to **choose a probability distribution**, so we need a strategy that works **even if Player 2 is rational and tries to maximize their own payoff**.

So let’s suppose that **Player 2** will also use a mixed strategy, and we are to find a **Nash equilibrium** with the three actions.

But that’s complicated.

Alternatively, let’s test **dominance** or **best responses**.

Let’s consider: Is **Delegate (A2)** ever strictly dominated?

Let’s compare your payoff for different choices given what Player 2 might do.

Let’s suppose **Player 2 is playing a fixed strategy**.

But instead, let’s suppose **Player 2 is playing optimally**, so we need a **symmetric or equilibrium-based approach**.

Try to find a **symmetric equilibrium** where both players use the same strategy.

Suppose both players use the same mixed strategy:
- P(A0) = x
- P(A1) = y
- P(A2) = z
With x + y + z = 1

But again, we need to find x,y,z that are best responses.

But let’s consider **simpler idea**: Can we find a **strategy for you** that gives high expected payoff **regardless** of what Player 2 does? Or find a **best response**?

Alternatively, let’s consider **dominant strategy**.

But no pure strategy dominant.

Let’s try to **find if delegating is valuable**.

Suppose **you delegate (A2)**.

- If Player 2 **does not delegate**, then only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get A1.
  - If Player 2 plays A0 → (A1, A0) → you get 6
  - If Player 2 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4
- If Player 2 **delegates**, then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → (A0,A0) → you get 10

So if you delegate, your payoff is:
- 6 if Player 2 plays A0
- 4 if Player 2 plays A1
- 10 if Player 2 plays A2

But Player 2 wants to get **their own payoff maximized**.

So let’s check: what would **Player 2** do in each case?

Suppose **you play A2**.

Then Player 2 sees:
- If they play A0 → you play A1 (via mediator), they play A0 → (A1,A0): Player 2 gets 2
- If they play A1 → you play A1, they play A1 → (A1,A1): Player 2 gets 4
- If they play A2 → both play A0 → (A0,A0): Player 2 gets 10

So if **you delegate**, Player 2 will **definitely want to delegate** (A2), because it gives them 10, vs 4 or 2.

So **if you delegate, Player 2 will choose A2**.

Thus, **if you play A2, Player 2 best responds by A2 → outcome: (A0,A0) → you get 10**

So **by delegating, you can induce a 10-point outcome**, **if Player 2 is rational and best responds**.

Now, what if **you play A0**?

Then Player 2 sees:
- If they play A0 → (A0,A0): Player 2 gets 10
- If they play A1 → (A0,A1): Player 2 gets 20
- If they play A2 → you play A0, they play A1 → (A0,A1): Player 2 gets 20

So **Player 2 will prefer to play A1 or A2** — both give 20, and A0 gives only 10.

So if you play A0, Player 2 will choose A1 or A2 (either, since both give same payoff), and **you will get 0** (because (A0,A1) → you get 0)

So if you play A0 → you get 0.

If you play A1?

Then Player 2 sees:
- If they play A0 → (A1,A0): Player 2 gets 2
- If they play A1 → (A1,A1): Player 2 gets 4
- If they play A2 → you play A1, they play A1 → (A1,A1): Player 2 gets 4

So Player 2 prefers **A1 or A2**, both give 4 > 2.

So Player 2 will choose A1 or A2 → you get 4 (in (A1,A1))

So summary:

| Your Action | Player 2’s Best Response | Your Payoff |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| A0          | A1 or A2 → both give 20 to them | 0 |
| A1          | A1 or A2 → both give 4 to them | 4 |
| A2          | A2 → gives 10 to them | 10 |

So if **you play A2**, and Player 2 is rational, they **will play A2**, and you get **10**.

If you play A1, you get **4** (if they play A1 or A2).

If you play A0, you get **0**.

So **A2 is the best choice**, giving **10**, vs 4 or 0.

But wait — can you **always get 10**? Only if Player 2 responds rationally.

And assuming they are rational and want to maximize their own payoff, **they will choose A2 when you choose A2**, because it gives them 10 (vs 4).

So **the outcome (A2, A2) gives you 10**, and **it’s stable** because:
- If you play A2, Player 2 best responds with A2 → you both get 10.
- If you play A2, and they play A1, you get 4, but they get only 4, while by playing A2 they get 10 — so they won’t.

So (A2, A2) is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Similarly, is there any other equilibrium?

Suppose both play A0: then Player 2 sees: if they deviate to A1, they get 20 > 10 → they will deviate → not equilibrium.

Similarly, if both play A1: Player 2 gets 4. If they deviate to A2 → then you are playing A1, they play A2 → only them delegate → mediator plays A1 → so they get A1 → (A1,A1), payoff 4 → same. So they are indifferent.

But if you play A1, and they play A2 → mediator plays A1 (only one delegate) → their action is A1 → payoff 4.

If they play A1 → also get 4.

So they are indifferent.

But also, if they deviate to A0 → (A1,A0): they get 2 < 4 → worse.

So if you play A1, they are indifferent between A1 and A2.

But if they deviate to A0 → worse, so they won’t.

But they get 4 in either case.

But you get 4 in either case.

But earlier, if you play A2, you can get 10.

So **A2 is strictly better** than A1 for you, as long as Player 2 is rational.

Now, what if you play a **mixed strategy**?

Suppose you mix A1 and A2.

But if you play A2 with any positive probability, then if Player 2 is rational, they will **still prefer** to play A2 when facing A2, because it gives them 10 > 4.

So even if you play A2 with low probability, Player 2 may still choose A2 to get 10.

But if you **never** delegate, they won’t.

So the **only way to get 10** is to **delegate**.

And if you delegate, they will respond with A2.

So the **only way to guarantee 10** is to **play A2**.

Is there any downside?

Suppose you play A2, Player 2 plays A2 → you get 10.

Suppose you play A2, and Player 2 **doesn’t** play A2 → then only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → (A1,A0) or (A1,A1) → you get 6 or 4, depending on what they play.

But Player 2 has no incentive to do that — they get 10 by playing A2, 4 by playing A1 → so **they will not deviate**.

So **as long as you play A2, Player 2 best responds with A2**, so outcome is (A0,A0) → you get 10.

Therefore, **playing A2 gives you guaranteed 10** in equilibrium.

Any other action gives you **less**:

- A0 → you get 0 (if they best respond)
- A1 → you get 4 (if they best respond)

So **A2 is strictly better**.

But is this a Nash equilibrium?

Yes:

- You play A2 → Player 2 gets 10 by playing A2 → better than 4 → so they best respond with A2.
- You play A2 → your payoff is 10.

If you deviate to A0 → you get 0 → worse.
If deviate to A1 → you get 4 → worse.

So **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**, and it gives you **10**.

Now, is there any other equilibrium where you get more than 10? No, maximum is 10.

So **this is optimal**.

Therefore, your best strategy is to **play A2 with probability 100%**.

But wait — what if Player 2 is **not rational**? But the problem says “maximize your total points”, so we assume **rational opponent**.

So in **equilibrium**, playing A2 gives you 10.

But could we do better? No.

Could we mix? Suppose you play A2 with 90%, A1 with 10%.

Then, if Player 2 is rational, they will still best respond to **your full strategy**.

- If you play A2 with 90%, A1 with 10%, then Player 2 sees:
  - If they play A0 → your action is: A2 (90%) or A1 (10%) → then your final action: A1 (90%), A1 (10%) → always A1 → you play A1 → (A1,A0): Player 2 gets 2
  - If they play A1 → you are playing A1 → (A1,A1): Player 2 gets 4
  - If they play A2 → you are playing A2 (90%) → only them delegate (10% of time) → but mostly you delegate → so in 90% of time, both delegate → A0 → (A0,A0): Player 2 gets 10
  - In 10% of time, you play A1, they play A2 → only they delegate → A1 → (A1,A1): Player 2 gets 4

So expected payoff for Player 2 if they play A2:
= 0.9 * 10 + 0.1 * 4 = 9 + 0.4 = 9.4

If they play A1: 4
If they play A0: 2

So **Player 2 still prefers A2** (9.4) > 4 > 2.

So they will play A2.

Then **you** will get:
- With 90%: you play A2 → both delegate → (A0,A0) → 10
- With 10%: you play A1 → they play A2 → (A1,A1) → 4

So your expected payoff = 0.9 * 10 + 0.1 * 4 = 9 + 0.4 = 9.4 < 10

So **worse than playing A2 always**.

So **pure strategy A2 is better**.

Similarly, if you mix with A0, it gets worse.

Therefore, **best response is pure A2**.

Moreover, in **Nash equilibrium**, **playing A2 with probability 100%** is optimal.

Thus, to maximize your expected payoff, you should **always delegate**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's work through this problem step by step to determine which mediators we should approve as **Player 2**, with the goal of **maximizing our expected points**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (no delegation)**
We are Player 2. The payoff matrix (from Player 2's perspective) is:

| Our Action ↓ \ Other Player's Action → | A0 | A1 |
|----------------------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                                 | 10 | 2  |
| **A1**                                 | 20 | 4  |

So, as Player 2:
- If we play A0 and opponent plays A0 → we get 10
- If we play A0 and opponent plays A1 → we get 2
- If we play A1 and opponent plays A0 → we get 20
- If we play A1 and opponent plays A1 → we get 4

We’re trying to maximize *our own* points.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze strategic incentives (without delegation)**

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium of the base game.

Let:
- p = probability we play A1
- q = probability opponent plays A1

Our expected payoff:
- E = p*q*4 + p*(1−q)*20 + (1−p)*q*2 + (1−p)*(1−q)*10

Simplify:
E = 4pq + 20p(1−q) + 2q(1−p) + 10(1−p)(1−q)

Compute:
= 4pq + 20p − 20pq + 2q − 2pq + 10(1 − p − q + pq)
= 4pq − 20pq − 2pq + 20p + 2q + 10 − 10p − 10q + 10pq
= (4−20−2+10)pq + (20−10)p + (2−10)q + 10
= (−8)pq + 10p − 8q + 10

Now, to find best response:
We can look for symmetric equilibria or solve for where best response is to make opponent indifferent.

But since we are only concerned with **our own strategy**, and we'll be deciding whether to delegate, let's think about what kind of behavior each mediator induces.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the mediator designs**

We are to approve or disapprove two mediators:

- **M1 (Player 1's proposal)**:
  - If 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1**
  - If 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0**

- **M2 (Player 2's proposal)**:
  - If 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A0**
  - If 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A1**

Note: The mediator is activated only **if at least one player delegates**. The action played depends on *how many delegates*.

The winning mediator is chosen **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So our votes matter in determining **which mediator gets selected**, based on approval counts.

We are Player 2.

---

### **Step 4: Strategic analysis — what happens when we delegate?**

We must consider **what happens in different delegation scenarios**.

Let’s analyze each mediation outcome based on:
- How many players delegate to the mediator (1 or 2)
- Which mediator is active (M1 or M2), depending on approval votes

Our goal: **maximize our expected points**

We are free to choose which mediators we approve — we can approve M1, M2, both, or neither.

But **only the mediator(s) with the most approvals** are eligible, and the one played is **chosen uniformly at random** from those.

So if we approve both M1 and M2, and they get the same number of approvals, they are both eligible, and one is picked at random.

If only one is approved, it wins by default.

So we must decide: which mediator should be selected?

Our strategy depends on:
- What the opponent will do
- Our own incentives

But recall: **both players choose simultaneously** whether to delegate and which mediator to approve.

So we must think about equilibrium behavior.

But the problem states: *“Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of.”*

So we are not playing a game in real time. We are deciding **what to do now**, based on expected outcomes.

We need to decide **which mediators we approve**, ideally in a way that leads to a favorable mediator being selected — one that helps us get higher expected payoff.

Let’s suppose we **approve a mediator** only if it's **strategically beneficial** for us.

But the mediator is chosen **after approvals**, randomly among the most-approved.

So we want **our preferred mediator(s) to be among the most-approved**, and **preferably the only one**, so we control the outcome.

Since we are Player 2, and the mediators are proposed by Player 1 and Player 2, we can consider our interest.

Let’s analyze each mediator under different delegation outcomes.

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate M1 (Player 1’s proposal)**

- 1 player delegates → M1 plays **A1**
- 2 players delegate → M1 plays **A0**

So:
- If only one player delegates (say, you do) → mediator plays A1 → you get A1
- If both players delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get A0

Now, **what happens if you delegate to M1?**

It depends on whether the other player delegates.

Let’s suppose **you delegate to M1**, and assume the other player is rational.

But we are trying to figure out which mediators to approve.

Let’s suppose **M1** is selected (i.e., approved by us and possibly others).

Then, depending on how many players delegate to it, it plays:

- A1 if 1 player delegates
- A0 if 2 players delegate

So, if **only one player delegates**, the mediator plays A1 → so your action is A1.

If **both delegate**, it plays A0 → your action is A0.

Now, we are Player 2.

So if you delegate to M1, your action is:
- A1 if opponent does **not** delegate
- A0 if opponent **does** delegate

Now, what's better for you (Player 2)?

Let’s compare:

- If opponent plays A0 → then:
  - If you play A1 → get 20
  - If you play A0 → get 10

→ So you prefer A1

- If opponent plays A1 → then:
  - A1 → 4
  - A0 → 2

→ So you prefer A1

Wait — in **both cases**, A1 gives you more or equal.

- Against A0: 20 > 10
- Against A1: 4 > 2

So **A1 dominates A0** for Player 2.

Wait — is that real?

Check the payoff:

- A1, A0 → 20
- A0, A0 → 10
- A1, A1 → 4
- A0, A1 → 2

So yes — **A1 weakly dominates A0** for Player 2.

Because:
- When opponent plays A0: A1 gives 20 vs 10
- When opponent plays A1: A1 gives 4 vs 2

So **for Player 2, A1 is always better or equal**.

So if you are free to choose, you’d **always prefer A1**, regardless of opponent’s action.

→ So **your best action is to play A1**.

But this is only if you're playing independently.

Now, if you delegate to a mediator, you give up control.

So if the mediator makes you play A0 or A1 depending on delegation, we must ask: **does it make you play A1 or A0 when it's optimal?**

Let’s analyze.

---

### **Step 6: What should we want our mediator to do?**

Since A1 is strictly better than A0 for Player 2 in all cases, we want the mediator to **play A1 whenever possible**.

But the mediator’s response depends on **how many delegates**.

So:

- If only one player delegates → mediator plays A1 → good for us
- If two players delegate → mediator plays A0 → bad for us

So for M1:
- 1 delegate → A1 → good
- 2 delegates → A0 → bad

So if we delegate, we want **only one** person to delegate.

But the game is symmetric in approval process — we don't know what the other player will do.

But suppose we approve M1.

Then if M1 wins (i.e., gets max approvals), and **we** delegate, we’ll get:
- A1 if opponent doesn’t delegate
- A0 if opponent does

But we want A1, so we prefer to be the **only delegate**.

But opponent might choose to delegate too, especially if they think it's good for them.

Let’s now analyze **M2 (Player 2's proposal)**

---

### **Step 7: Evaluate M2 (Player 2’s proposal)**

- 1 player delegates → M2 plays **A0**
- 2 players delegate → M2 plays **A1**

So:
- If only you delegate → M2 plays A0 → you get A0
- If both delegate → M2 plays A1 → you get A1

Now, for Player 2: we want A1, not A0.

So:
- If only one player delegates → we get A0 → bad
- If both delegate → we get A1 → good

So again, M2 gives us A0 if we are the only delegate — which is bad — because we’d prefer A1.

But if both of us delegate, we get A1 → good.

So in both mediators:

- M1: A1 if *only one* delegates, A0 if *both* do
- M2: A0 if *only one* delegates, A1 if *both* do

But we want to play A1 — that’s the dominant strategy.

So **both mediators are risky**, depending on whether we are alone or not.

But notice: **M1 helps us get A1 when we are the only delegate**.

**M2 helps us get A1 when both delegate**.

But since we want A1, we need to **favor scenarios where we play A1**.

Now, consider: **what if both of us delegate?**

Let’s suppose both players delegate.

Then:
- If M1 is used: both get A0
- If M2 is used: both get A1

→ So **M1 is bad** if both delegate → yields A0
→ **M2 is good** if both delegate → yields A1

But if only one delegates:
- M1: gives A1 → good
- M2: gives A0 → bad

So:
- M1 is good for us if we are the only one delegating
- M2 is good for us if both delegate

But we are Player 2.

Now, can we influence whether both delegate?

Not directly — but we can influence which mediator is selected.

Let’s suppose **we approve only M1**.

Then M1 will be selected if it gets the most approvals.

We approve M1 → count = 1

If opponent approves M1 → count = 2 → M1 wins

If opponent approves M2 only → M1 still wins (1 vs 0)

If opponent approves neither → M1 wins

So if we approve only M1, **M1 wins**.

Then, if both delegate → M1 plays A0 → we get 0 points if opponent plays A0? Wait no.

Wait: if both delegate, mediator plays A0 → so we play A0.

Opponent plays whatever they play.

But if **both delegate** to M1, we each play A0.

So if opponent plays A0 → we get 10
If opponent plays A1 → we get 2

But remember, **you play A0**.

So your payoff depends on opponent.

But we want to get high payoff.

Let’s calculate expected payoff in different scenarios.

But since we don’t know what opponent will do, we must reason strategically.

But here's a key insight:

- **M2’s behavior is better when both delegate** (gives A1), which is what we want
- **M1’s behavior is better when only one delegates** (gives A1)

But **we don’t control whether the other player delegates**.

But we **can choose to delegate or not**.

Suppose we want to **maximize our expected payoff**, and we can influence which mediator is selected.

Let’s consider **what happens if we approve only M2**.

Then M2 wins (unless opponent approves M1 more, but if opponent also approves M2, it’s still M2).

So if we approve only M2, it will be selected.

Then:
- If only one delegate → M2 plays A0 → we get A0
- If both delegate → M2 plays A1 → we get A1

So if **we delegate to M2**, our action is:
- A0 if opponent doesn’t delegate
- A1 if opponent does delegate

Now, **this is good**: we play A1 only when both delegate.

But **we don’t control opponent’s action**.

But since we want to play A1 (which dominates), we’d prefer to play A1.

So if **opponent delegates**, good — we get A1.

If **opponent does not delegate**, we get A0 — bad.

So it’s better for us if **opponent delegates**.

But why would opponent delegate? They might not.

Now, compare to **approving only M1**:

M1 wins.

Then:
- If we delegate, we get:
  - A1 if opponent does **not** delegate (good)
  - A0 if opponent **does** delegate (bad)

So again, we prefer opponent **not** to delegate.

So in **both cases**, we have a desire for the other player to **not** delegate if we use M1, and to **do** delegate if we use M2.

But we don’t control opponent.

But here’s a twist: **if we delegate, we are committed to whatever the mediator does**.

But we can choose **not to delegate**.

So we can think: **should we delegate at all?**

But the decision to delegate is separate from the approval.

We must decide **what to approve**, but then later we decide whether to delegate.

But for the approval phase, we just decide which mediators to approve.

So we must choose approvals **to maximize our expected payoff**, given that the final mediator is chosen at random from most-approved.

Now, here’s a **key idea**: we want the mediator that is most likely to help us get A1.

But it’s tricky.

Alternatively, let’s consider **which mediator maximizes our expected payoff in equilibrium**.

But perhaps we can think in terms of **what outcome we want**.

We want to **get A1**.

- M1 gives A1 only when **exactly one delegate** (so if only you delegate, you get A1)
- M2 gives A1 only when **both delegate**

So to get A1:
- With M1: you must be the **only** delegate
- With M2: you must be **one of two delegates**

Now, suppose we are risk-averse or want a higher chance.

But let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoffs.

What if both players think: "I want to get A1. M2 gives A1 only if both delegate. But if I delegate alone, I get A0, which is bad. So I don’t want to delegate alone."

So both players might reason: "I won’t delegate unless both of us do."

But if both think that, then **neither delegates**.

Then no mediator is used.

But if no one delegates, then we play independently.

In that case, as Player 2, we play A1 (since it dominates), so we get:
- If opponent plays A0 → 20
- If opponent plays A1 → 4

But opponent will also play A1 (since A1 dominates for them too).

Check payoff for Player 1:
- A0, A0 → 10
- A1, A0 → 0
- A0, A1 → 6
- A1, A1 → 4

So for Player 1:
- A0: against A0 → 10; against A1 → 6 → average 8
- A1: against A0 → 0; against A1 → 4 → average 2

So Player 1 prefers A0.

Player 2 prefers A1.

So in independent play:
- Player 1 will play A0
- Player 2 will play A1

Result: A1 vs A0 → Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0

So if no one delegates, and we play independently, we get 20.

Now, will someone want to delegate?

Suppose we consider M2: if both delegate, M2 plays A1 → so we get A1.

But if we delegate alone, M2 plays A0 → we get A0 → bad.

So we would only want to delegate if we expect the opponent to delegate.

But **if the opponent expects us to delegate only if they do**, and vice versa, they might both delegate.

But let’s suppose we approve M2.

Then M2 is available.

Suppose both of us delegate to M2 → M2 plays A1 (since two delegates) → both play A1 → payoff: 4 each.

But if we delegate and opponent does not, we play A0 → only 2 if opponent plays A1, or 10 if opponent plays A0.

But opponent will play A0 (since it's their dominant strategy) — in independent play.

But if we delegate to M2, and opponent does not, we play A0.

Then opponent plays A0 → we get 10.

Wait: if opponent plays A0, we get 10.

But we could get 20 if we play A1 and opponent plays A0.

But if we play A0 and opponent plays A0 → we get 10.

So 10 < 20 → worse than independent play.

But if both delegate: we get A1, opponent gets A1 → we get 4.

So:
- If only one delegates: we get **10** (if opponent plays A0) or 2 (if opponent plays A1)
  - But opponent will play A0 → so we get 10
- If both delegate: we get 4

So both outcomes are worse than **independent play (20)**.

So why would we delegate to M2?

Only if we can coordinate to both delegate, but then we get only 4, which is worse than 20.

So **delegation to M2 leads to lower payoff** in all cases.

Now, what about M1?

M1:
- 1 delegate → plays A1
- 2 delegates → plays A0

Suppose we delegate to M1.

If opponent does not delegate:
- we play A1, opponent plays A0 (since independent) → we get 20 → good

If opponent delegates:
- both play A0 → we get 10 (if opponent plays A0) or 2 (if opponent plays A1)
- but opponent will play A0 → so we get 10

So in case of single delegate: we get 20
In case of two delegates: we get 10

But 10 < 20, so we prefer **only one delegate**.

But if we delegate, and opponent does not, we get 20.

If we don't delegate, we play A1 (dominant), opponent plays A0 → we get 20.

So **there's no benefit in delegating to M1**: in both cases, we get either 20 or 10, while by playing A1 independently, we get 20 for sure.

So **delegation to M1 gives us either 20 (if opponent doesn't delegate) or 10 (if they do)** — but independent play gives 20.

So delegation is worse or equal.

So **we should never delegate**.

But could we benefit from delegation under some mediator?

Only if the mediator can get us A1 when opponent plays A0, and avoid A0 otherwise.

But in this game, **independent play already gives us A1, and opponent plays A0**, so we get 20.

Delegation doesn't help.

But wait — what if the mediator allows us to **coordinate**?

No, because the other player might have different incentives.

But here’s a twist: **we can choose which mediator to approve**.

Suppose we want the **mediator to be M1**.

Then, if someone delegates, M1 plays A1 if only one delegate.

But if both delegate, M1 plays A0.

But we don’t want to delegate.

But if **the other player** delegates, and they delegate to M1, then they play A1.

But opponent wants to maximize their own payoff.

Opponent's payoffs:
- A0, A0 → 10
- A1, A0 → 0
- A0, A1 → 6
- A1, A1 → 4

So opponent prefers A0.

If they delegate to M1:
- If they are the only one, M1 plays A1 → they get A1
- Against our A0 → they get 0 → very bad
- Against our A1 → they get 4

But if we play A1, and they play A1 → they get 4

But if they play A0, they get 10.

So they prefer A0.

So **they will not delegate to M1**, because it forces them to play A1, which is worse.

Similarly, if they delegate to M2:
- If only one delegate, M2 plays A0 → good for them
- If both delegate, M2 plays A1 → they get 4

But if we play A1, they get 4 → worse than 10, so they prefer A0.

So **opponent will never delegate**, because:
- Delegating to M1 forces A1 when alone → gets 0 or 4
- Delegating to M2 forces A0 when alone → gets 10, same as independent
- Delegating to M2 when both → gets 4, worse

So only potential gain is when they delegate alone to M2: they get A0, same as independent.

But they get no benefit.

So **opponent will never delegate**.

Similarly, we are Player 2, we prefer A1.

Delegating to M1: if we delegate alone, we get A1 → we get 20 (opponent plays A0) → good

But we can get 20 by playing A1 independently.

And if both delegate, we get A0 → we get 10.

So better to not delegate.

So **in equilibrium, no one delegates**.

Then we both play independently: we play A1, opponent plays A0 → we get 20.

So delegation gains nothing.

But now: **which mediators should we approve?**

We are deciding which mediators to approve.

The mediator is chosen **randomly** among those with maximum approvals.

We must decide.

But if **we don’t approve any mediator**, and opponent approves nothing, then no mediator is chosen, so no delegation.

But the problem says: "the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if **no one approves any mediator**, then no winner, so no delegation.

But the game still happens.

But we are to approve mediators.

Now, if we approve a mediator, we can influence who wins.

But since **no one delegates in equilibrium**, the mediator is never used.

So **whether we approve a mediator or not doesn’t matter**, because it won’t be used.

But the **approval voting** is **before** the delegation decision.

And the winner is selected.

Then, players decide whether to delegate to it.

But since delegation is never rational (because independent play gives 20), and delegation to any mediator gives less or equal (20 vs 10 or 4), **no one will delegate**.

So the mediator is irrelevant.

But we must still pick which to approve.

But the problem asks: **"decide which ones you approve of"**, and we must return a JSON.

But our goal is to **maximize expected points**.

Since the mediator won’t be used in equilibrium, **it doesn't affect points**.

So **our approval doesn’t matter**.

But we still have to choose.

But perhaps we can **influence the outcome** if we think the opponent might act differently.

But if both are rational, no one delegates.

But maybe we can **make a mediator that is better for us if someone does delegate**.

But since no one will, it doesn’t matter.

But wait: **what if by approving a mediator, we can force a better outcome?**

No — because the mediator is not used.

But here’s a key insight: **if we approve a mediator, and it wins, it might affect our decision to delegate.**

But we already know delegation is not beneficial.

But suppose the opponent thinks that we will delegate if M1 is chosen, but we don’t.

No.

Alternatively, **suppose that we approve M1**, and opponent approves nothing, then M1 wins.

Then, if I delegate to M1, I get A1 if opponent doesn’t delegate, A0 if they do.

But since opponent won’t delegate, I get A1 → same as independent play.

But I could get 20.

But if I don’t delegate, I get 20 anyway.

So no difference.

But what if we approve both M1 and M2?

Then the mediator is chosen uniformly at random between M1 and M2.

So 50% chance M1, 50% M2.

Now, if I delegate to this random mediator, it depends.

But still, in equilibrium, I won’t delegate.

So again, no change.

But perhaps there’s a **strategic reason to approve one or both**.

But since no delegation will happen, and we get 20 either way, it doesn’t matter.

But wait — what if by approving a mediator, we make it more likely that the other player delegates?

For example, suppose we approve M2.

Then M2 is available.

The other player considers: “if I delegate to M2, and I’m the only one, I get A0 → which is what I get anyway.”

No gain.

So they won’t.

Similarly for M1.

So **no one delegates**.

Therefore, **our approval choice doesn’t affect our final points**, since we always get 20.

So we should approve any mediator we want.

But to maximize robustness, or perhaps to express preference.

But the problem is to maximize expected points.

Since points are unaffected, we can approve both or neither.

But let’s reconsider: **could we benefit from a mediator in a different way?**

Suppose we approve only M1.

Then if M1 wins, and the opponent delegates to it, what happens?

Opponent delegating to M1:
- If only one delegate → M1 plays A1 → opponent plays A1
- We play A1 (independent) → so we get 4
- But if we play A1 and opponent plays A1, we get 4
- But with no delegation, we get 20

So much worse.

So if opponent delegates, we get only 4.

But opponent won’t delegate because it gives them at most 4 or 0, while independence gives 10.

So no incentive.

So in all cases, no one delegates.

Thus, final payoff is 20.

Therefore, **our approval choices do not affect our points**.

So we can approve any or none.

But the problem requires us to return a JSON.

We must pick.

But perhaps we can approve **one** mediator to increase the chance that a "good" one is selected, but in this case, **both are bad or neutral**.

Wait — earlier we saw that for Player 2, **A1 is dominant**.

Now, look at M2:

- If both delegate → M2 plays A1
- If only one delegates → M2 plays A0

But if both delegate, we get A1, which is good.

But opponent, if they delegate alone, get A0, which is not good for them.

So they won’t.

But **we are Player 2**.

Suppose we are considering approving M2.

Then, if somehow both of us delegate, we get A1, which is good.

But opponent won’t.

So no.

But here's a thought: **if we approve M1, and M1 wins, and we delegate, we get A1 if opponent doesn't delegate** — which is good.

But we can get A1 independently.

So no benefit.

But notice: **M1 gives us A1 when only one delegate**, which is good.

**M2 gives us A1 when both delegate**, which is also good.

But since we get A1 independently for certain, both are redundant.

But perhaps we should approve a mediator that is **more likely to be selected**.

But it doesn't matter.

Perhaps we should **approve M2** because it is proposed by Player 2, and we are Player 2, so we're on the same side.

But that's not strategic.

Let’s think differently.

Suppose we approve **M1**.

Then if M1 wins, and we delegate, we get A1 if opponent doesn't delegate.

But we get the same.

But if we approve **M2**, and M2 wins, and we delegate, we get A1 only if opponent does.

So it's worse.

So M1 is better than M2 for us if we delegate.

But we don't want to.

But since neither is used, it doesn't matter.

But perhaps there's a way to **commit to a strategy**.

No.

After all this, the only rational conclusion is that **delegation is not beneficial**, so the mediator will not be used.

Therefore, our approval doesn't affect our points.

So we can approve any.

But to be safe, and since M1 gives us A1 when alone, which is good, and M2 gives us A0 when alone, which is bad, we should favor M1.

But since we don't delegate, it doesn't matter.

But perhaps we should approve **M1** because it is more aligned with our interest.

Or perhaps approve **neither** to avoid any risk.

But there is no risk.

Another idea: if we approve a mediator that is not approved by anyone else, it might be chosen, but still won't be used.

So no.

But the problem is that we are to choose to maximize our points.

Since the points are 20 regardless, we can choose.

But let's look back at the payoffs.

Wait a second.

In the independent play, we play A1, opponent plays A0 → we get 20.

But if we could **commit to A1** through a mediator, but we already do.

But suppose for a moment that we **do** delegate.

But as we saw, it's not beneficial.

But here's a final idea: **if we approve M1, and M1 wins, and we delegate to it, then we get A1 if opponent doesn't delegate, which is what we want, and we get it without risk**.

But we can get the same by playing A1.

So no advantage.

But if the other player were to delegate to M1, then we would get A0, which is bad.

But they won't.

So no.

After careful analysis, the optimal strategy for both players is to **not delegate**, and play independently.

Our points will be 20.

Approval of any mediator doesn't change this.

So we can approve any.

But to have a preference, let's choose the mediator that is more consistent with our dominant strategy.

M1:
- When only one delegate, plays A1 — good for us
- When two, plays A0 — bad

M2:
- When only one, plays A0 — bad for us
- When two, plays A1 — good

So M1 is better in the case that matters more: only one delegate.

Since only one delegate is more likely (because both players avoid delegation), M1 is better.

Therefore, we should approve M1.

We can also approve M2, but it has a worse outcome when only one delegate.

But since we have to pick, and no harm in approval, but to be strategic, let's approve only M1.

But the problem might expect us to approve based on what is best.

Another thought: if we approve M1, and the other player doesn't approve any, M1 wins.

Then if we delegate, we get A1 if opponent doesn't delegate — good.

But we can do the same without.

But perhaps we should approve M1 because it is more aligned with our incentives.

Final decision:

- We should approve M1 because it is more likely to play A1 in the case where only one delegate, which is the likely case.
- We should not approve M2 because it plays A0 when only one delegate, which is bad for us.

Therefore, we approve M1, not M2.

So:

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": false}
```

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Let's solve this step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are in a two-player simultaneous move game. Each player chooses an action: A0 or A1, or (with the twist) A2 = "Delegate to Mediator".

The payoffs are given as:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Points | Opponent's Points |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 10          | 10                |
| A0          | A1                | 0           | 20                |
| A1          | A0                | 6           | 2                 |
| A1          | A1                | 4           | 4                 |

You are **Player 1**.

This is a classic asymmetric game. Let's consider if there's a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

But now there's a twist: **delegation to a mediator**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You have a new action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

- The mediator’s behavior depends on **how many players** delegate to it:
  - If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
  - If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Note:
- You choose whether to delegate or not.
- The other player (Player 2) also chooses independently.

So, possible cases:
1. **You delegate, Player 2 does not** → 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1 → you get payoff based on A1 vs Player 2's action.
2. **You do not delegate, Player 2 delegates** → 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 2 gets A1, you play your own action.
3. **Both delegate** → 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get payoff from A0 vs A0.
4. **Neither delegates** → no delegation → both play their own actions.

We must now consider that **both players will be strategic**, and we need a **mixed strategy** that maximizes **our own expected payoff**, assuming we are rational and the other player is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.

But the twist is: **You control the delegation decision.**

We are to choose a **probability distribution** over A0, A1, A2 (i.e., delegate), such that our **expected payoff is maximized**, **assuming the other player is also rational and optimizing their own payoff**.

This suggests we are looking for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies, including A2 as an action.

---

### **Step 3: Model the Strategic Interaction**

We need to find a symmetric or asymmetric equilibrium over the combined strategy space: {A0, A1, A2} for both players.

Let’s denote:
- Your strategy: (p0, p1, p2), where p0 + p1 + p2 = 100, and:
  - p0 = Pr(choose A0)
  - p1 = Pr(choose A1)
  - p2 = Pr(choose A2 = delegate)

Similarly, let the opponent (Player 2) use strategy: (q0, q1, q2), q0 + q1 + q2 = 100.

We are to find your optimal (p0, p1, p2) **assuming the opponent is also playing optimally**.

But note: The mediator’s behavior depends on the **number** of delegators, not who they are. So the outcome depends on:

- Number of delegators: 0, 1, or 2.

Let’s compute the **expected payoff for Player 1** as a function of your strategy (p0, p1, p2) and the opponent’s strategy (q0, q1, q2).

But since we’re looking for equilibrium, we want to find a strategy profile where neither player can gain by unilaterally changing.

However, since the game is symmetric in structure (same payoffs, same mediator rule), **we can consider a symmetric equilibrium** — that is, both players use the same strategy.

Let’s assume **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**: p0 = q0, p1 = q1, p2 = q2.

But is symmetry likely? Let's see.

---

### **Step 4: Check Payoffs in Delegation Scenarios**

Let’s define the **expected payoff** for Player 1 in each possible delegation outcome:

Case 1: **Neither delegates** → both play independently.

- You play A0 with p0, A1 with p1.
- Opponent plays A0 with q0, A1 with q1.
- So expected payoff is:
  - p0*q0 *10 + p0*q1 *0 + p1*q0 *6 + p1*q1 *4

Case 2: **Only you delegate** → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays their own move.

- You get:
  - q0 * (your payoff when you play A1 vs opponent's A0) = q0 * 6
  - q1 * (your payoff when you play A1 vs opponent's A1) = q1 * 4
  - So expected from this case: 6*q0 + 4*q1

- This occurs with probability: p2 * (1 - q2)

Case 3: **Only opponent delegates** → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1, you play your own move.

- You get:
  - p0 * (you play A0 vs opp's A1) = p0 * 0
  - p1 * (you play A1 vs opp's A1) = p1 * 4
  - So expected: 0*p0 + 4*p1 = 4*p1

- This occurs with probability: (1 - p2) * q2

Case 4: **Both delegate** → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0.

- You get 10 points.

- Occurs with probability: p2 * q2

Now, total expected payoff for Player 1:

E1 =  
[Prob 0 del] × (p0 q0 × 10 + p0 q1 × 0 + p1 q0 × 6 + p1 q1 × 4)  
+ [Prob only you del] × (6 q0 + 4 q1)  
+ [Prob only opp del] × (4 p1)  
+ [Prob both del] × 10

But since we are assuming **symmetric equilibrium** (both players use same strategy), we can set p0 = q0, p1 = q1, p2 = q2.

Let’s define:
- p0 = a
- p1 = b
- p2 = c

So a + b + c = 100

Then:

- Prob 0 del: (1 - c)^2
- Prob only you del: c(1 - c)
- Prob only opp del: (1 - c)c
- Prob both del: c^2

Now, compute E1:

**Part 1: Neither delegate**
- Expected payoff: a*a*10 + a*b*0 + b*a*6 + b*b*4 = 10a² + 6ab + 4b²

**Part 2: Only you delegate** → you get A1, opponent plays A0 with prob a, A1 with prob b
- So you get: 6a + 4b
- Prob: c(1 - c)

**Part 3: Only opponent delegates** → opponent plays A1, you play A0 with prob a, A1 with prob b
- You get: 0*a + 4*b = 4b
- Prob: c(1 - c)

**Part 4: Both delegate** → both get A0, so you get 10
- Prob: c²

So total expected payoff:

E1 =  
(1 - c)^2 * (10a² + 6ab + 4b²)  
+ c(1 - c) * (6a + 4b)  
+ c(1 - c) * (4b)  
+ c² * 10

Simplify:

E1 = (1 - c)^2 (10a² + 6ab + 4b²)  
+ c(1 - c) (6a + 4b + 4b)  
+ 10c²  
= (1 - c)^2 (10a² + 6ab + 4b²)  
+ c(1 - c)(6a + 8b)  
+ 10c²

Now, in symmetric equilibrium, we want **each pure strategy to have equal expected payoff**, or the player is indifferent among the strategies they mix over.

So let’s suppose that in equilibrium, **all three actions are played with positive probability** — that is, a > 0, b > 0, c > 0.

Then, in mixed strategy equilibrium, **the expected payoff from A0, A1, and A2 must be equal**.

So we can compute the **expected payoff of playing A0** (if you choose A0, but opponent mixes), **same for A1**, and **same for A2**, and set them equal.

Let’s do that.

---

### **Step 5: Compute Expected Payoff of Each Action (Given Opponent’s Strategy)**

Assume opponent uses strategy (a, b, c) — i.e., play A0 with prob a%, A1 with b%, A2 with c%.

We compute:
- E[A0] = expected payoff if you play A0
- E[A1] = expected payoff if you play A1
- E[A2] = expected payoff if you play A2

Then, in equilibrium, E[A0] = E[A1] = E[A2]

Let’s compute each.

---

#### **E[A0]: You play A0, opponent plays mixed strategy**

When you play A0, your payoff depends on:
- Opponent’s choice: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)

But if opponent delegates, mediator plays A1 if only 1 delegate, A0 if both.

So:

- If **opponent plays A0**: you play A0 vs A0 → you get 10
- If **opponent plays A1**: you play A0 vs A1 → you get 0
- If **opponent plays A2 (delegate)**: then:
  - How many total delegates? Only opponent delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
  - So opponent plays A1
  - So you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 0

Thus: **if you play A0**, regardless of opponent’s move, your payoff depends on opponent’s action:
- A0 → 10
- A1 → 0
- A2 → 0

So:
E[A0] = a × 10 + b × 0 + c × 0 = 10a

---

#### **E[A1]: You play A1**

Now, you play A1; opponent plays:
- A0: then you get 6 (from A1 vs A0)
- A1: you get 4
- A2 (delegate): opponent plays A1 (since only one delegate → mediator plays A1), so you play A1 vs A1 → you get 4

Thus:
E[A1] = a × 6 + b × 4 + c × 4 = 6a + 4b + 4c

---

#### **E[A2]: You play A2 (delegate)**

Now, your payoff depends on **how many delegates total**.

Case 1: Opponent does **not** delegate → only you delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 (since delegated)
- Then, opponent plays their move: A0 with prob a, A1 with prob b
- Your payoff when you play A1:
  - vs A0: 6
  - vs A1: 4
- So expected: 6a + 4b

Case 2: Opponent **does** delegate → both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
- Then, opponent plays A0
- So you play A0 vs A0 → you get 10

Therefore:
E[A2] = (1 - c) × (6a + 4b) + c × 10

Because:
- Prob only you delegate: (1 - c) → payoff: 6a + 4b
- Prob both delegate: c → payoff: 10

So:
E[A2] = (1 - c)(6a + 4b) + 10c

---

### **Step 6: Set Expected Payoffs Equal (Equilibrium Condition)**

In equilibrium, E[A0] = E[A1] = E[A2]

Set them equal:

#### Equation 1: E[A0] = E[A1]
10a = 6a + 4b + 4c  
→ 10a - 6a = 4b + 4c  
→ 4a = 4b + 4c  
→ a = b + c  ...(1)

#### Equation 2: E[A1] = E[A2]
6a + 4b + 4c = (1 - c)(6a + 4b) + 10c

Expand RHS:
(1 - c)(6a + 4b) + 10c = (6a + 4b) - c(6a + 4b) + 10c  
= 6a + 4b - 6a c - 4b c + 10c

LHS: 6a + 4b + 4c

Set equal:
6a + 4b + 4c = 6a + 4b - 6a c - 4b c + 10c

Subtract 6a + 4b from both sides:
4c = -6a c - 4b c + 10c

Bring all to left:
4c + 6a c + 4b c - 10c = 0  
→ (-6c) + 6a c + 4b c = 0  
→ 6a c + 4b c - 6c = 0  
Divide by 2c (assuming c ≠ 0):
3a + 2b - 3 = 0  
→ 3a + 2b = 3  ...(2)

Now, use equation (1): a = b + c

Also, a + b + c = 100 → (b + c) + b + c = 100 → 2b + 2c = 100 → b + c = 50 → a = 50

So:
a = 50

From b + c = 50 → c = 50 - b

Plug into (2):
3a + 2b = 3  
→ 3*50 + 2b = 3  
→ 150 + 2b = 3  
→ 2b = 3 - 150 = -147  
→ b = -73.5

Impossible! Negative probability.

So contradiction.

Therefore, **our assumption that all three actions are used (c > 0, b > 0)** leads to a contradiction.

So **the equilibrium cannot involve all three strategies with positive probability**.

Thus, in equilibrium, **one or more actions have zero probability**.

---

### **Step 7: Try Equilibria Without Delegation (c = 0)**

Suppose **c = 0** → no delegation.

Then the game reduces to classic 2x2 game.

Your strategy: a = Pr(A0), b = 1 - a (since c = 0)

Opponent strategy: same (symmetric) → q0 = a, q1 = 1 - a

Compute E[A0] = 10a + 0*(1 - a) = 10a

E[A1] = 6a + 4*(1 - a) = 6a + 4 - 4a = 2a + 4

Set equal: 10a = 2a + 4 → 8a = 4 → a = 0.5

So symmetric mixed strategy: play A0 with 50%, A1 with 50%

But check: is this a Nash equilibrium?

Yes, in the standard game, this is a well-known asymmetric game with a mixed strategy NE where each plays A0 with 50%, A1 with 50%.

But we are now considering **if delegation can improve payoff**.

Let’s check if **c = 0** is still best.

But we have another possibility: **c > 0 but b = 0**, i.e., we never play A1, only A0 and A2.

Try assuming **b = 0** (never play A1)

Then a + c = 100

From earlier, we had equation (1): a = b + c → a = 0 + c → a = c

But a + c = 100 → a = c = 50

So: a = 50, b = 0, c = 50 → play A0 50%, delegate 50%

Now check expected payoffs.

Compute:
- E[A0] = 10a = 10*50 = 500 (in % units? Wait — we need to be careful.)

We must work in actual probabilities, not percentages.

Let’s redefine to **probabilities (fractions)**.

Let:
- p0 = a
- p1 = 0
- p2 = c
With a + c = 1

We found a = c = 0.5

So:

E[A0] = 10 * a = 10 * 0.5 = 5  
E[A1] = 6a + 4c = 6*0.5 + 4*0.5 = 3 + 2 = 5  
E[A2] = (1 - c)(6a + 4b) + 10c = (1 - 0.5)(6*0.5 + 0) + 10*0.5 = 0.5 * 3 + 5 = 1.5 + 5 = 6.5

Wait — E[A2] = 6.5, but E[A0] = E[A1] = 5

So E[A2] > E[A0], so you would prefer to delegate → so best response is to play A2 → but we are playing it with 50%, but its payoff is higher → so **you should play A2 more**.

Thus, **this is not an equilibrium** — because A2 gives higher payoff than A0 and A1.

So you'd deviate.

So not a NE.

But this suggests **delegation might be valuable**.

Try another idea: suppose **a = 0**, **b = 0**, so only delegate?

But that can’t be — if both players only delegate, then both get 10, but if one deviates and plays A0, see what happens.

Suppose opponent plays only A2 (c = 1), you play A0.

Then: only you — but opponent delegates → total one delegate → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1.

You play A0 vs A1 → you get 0.

But if you had delegated, you’d get 10.

So better to delegate.

So if opponent delegates, you want to delegate.

Similarly, if you delegate, you get:
- If opponent doesn’t delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get A1 → opponent plays A0 or A1 → your payoff depends.

But earlier we found contradiction when assuming c > 0 and b > 0.

Alternative idea: **Only delegation is used in equilibrium?**

Try **symmetric pure strategy: both always delegate (c = 1)**

Then: both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → both get 10

Now, if you **deviate to A0**: you play A0, opponent delegates → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1

You play A0 vs A1 → you get 0 < 10 → bad

If you deviate to A1: you play A1, opponent plays A1 → you get 4 < 10 → bad

So **no incentive to deviate**.

So **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium** with payoff **10 for both**.

Now, in the pure strategy A0,A0 game, both get 10, so this is at least as good.

But can we get more?

Wait — in the symmetric mixed NE without delegation (50%, 50%), let’s compute expected payoff.

Your strategy: 50% A0, 50% A1

Opponent same.

Then:
- A0 vs A0: 10 × 0.25 = 2.5
- A0 vs A1: 0 × 0.25 = 0
- A1 vs A0: 6 × 0.25 = 1.5
- A1 vs A1: 4 × 0.25 = 1
Total: 2.5 + 0 + 1.5 + 1 = 5

So expected payoff: 5

But in the pure delegation equilibrium, you get **10**.

So **much better**.

So if both players always delegate, you get 10 — better than 5.

But is this the only equilibrium?

Wait — what if one player deviates?

In (A2, A2), both get 10.

If one player deviates to A0: then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1.

You play A0 vs A1 → you get 0 < 10.

Similarly, if you deviate to A1, you get 4 < 10.

So **no incentive to deviate**.

So (A2, A2) is a **Nash equilibrium with payoff 10**.

Now, is there any better equilibrium?

Suppose you try to play mixed strategy involving delegation and A0.

But in (A2, A2), you get 10.

Can you get more than 10?

Maximum possible payoff is 10 (if you play A0 and opponent plays A0).

But if you get 10, that’s best.

In (A2, A2), you get 10.

Is there an equilibrium where you get more?

No — maximum is 10.

So 10 is optimal.

But can we get 10 with other strategies?

Only if you play A0 and opponent plays A0.

But if opponent plays A0, and you play A0 → 10.

But if you delegate, you get A0 only if both delegate → then A0 vs A0 → 10.

Same.

But if you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 0 → bad.

So perhaps (A2, A2) is the best.

But is this the only equilibrium?

Suppose we try a mixed strategy where only one player delegates.

But if both are rational, and knowing that (A2, A2) gives 10, and deviating gives less, **both prefer to delegate**.

So (A2, A2) is a stable equilibrium.

Now, could there be a **player who is better off** by not delegating?

Only if opponent is not delegating.

Suppose opponent always plays A0.

Then if you delegate: 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 6

If you play A0: get 10

So better to play A0.

But if you play A0, you get 10 > 6.

So only if opponent is playing A1 or delegating, can delegation be better.

But in equilibrium, we assume opponent is playing rationally.

So if your opponent is going to delegate, you get 10 by delegating, or less by not.

So **better to delegate**.

Therefore, **if the other player is expected to delegate, you want to delegate too**.

And if both do, you get 10.

Thus, (A2, A2) is a strong equilibrium.

But is there a **better** equilibrium? No.

But could we get a **mixed strategy** that gives higher than 10? No.

But wait — suppose both players **randomly delegate or not**, but in a way that expected payoff is higher.

But maximum per game is 10.

But in (A2, A2), we get 10 with certainty.

So best possible.

Now, could both players use a mixed strategy where delegation is used, but not always?

But earlier calculation showed that if b = 0 (no A1), a = c = 50%, we had E[A2] = 6.5, E[A0] = 5 → so you want to increase p2 — so not stable.

Suppose we try to find a symmetric equilibrium where **only A2 and A0 are used**.

Let a = Pr(A0), c = Pr(A2), b = 0, a + c = 1

Then E[A0] = 10a  
E[A2] = (1 - c)(6a + 4*0) + 10c = (1 - c)(6a) + 10c

Set E[A0] = E[A2] for indifference:

10a = 6a(1 - c) + 10c

But c = 1 - a

So:

10a = 6a(1 - (1 - a)) + 10(1 - a)  
= 6a * a + 10 - 10a  
= 6a² + 10 - 10a

So:

10a = 6a² - 10a + 10  
Bring all to left:

10a - 6a² + 10a - 10 = 0  
20a - 6a² - 10 = 0  
Divide by 2: 10a - 3a² - 5 = 0  
→ -3a² + 10a - 5 = 0  
→ 3a² - 10a + 5 = 0

Discriminant: 100 - 60 = 40 → √40 ≈ 6.32

a = [10 ± 6.32]/6

a ≈ (16.32)/6 ≈ 2.72 → too big  
a ≈ (3.68)/6 ≈ 0.613

So a ≈ 0.613, c ≈ 0.387

Now compute E[A0] = 10a ≈ 6.13

E[A2] = (1 - c)(6a) + 10c = a * 6a + 10c = 6a² + 10c

= 6*(0.613)^2 + 10*0.387 ≈ 6*0.376 + 3.87 ≈ 2.256 + 3.87 = 6.126

≈ equal

But now check if A1 is worse: E[A1] = 6a + 4c = 6*0.613 + 4*0.387 ≈ 3.678 + 1.548 = 5.226 < 6.13 → so not profitable to play A1

But now, **is this stable?** Only if opponent is using same strategy.

But we must check if **E[A2] > E[A0]** — no, they are equal.

But now, what is the expected payoff?

≈ 6.13

Which is **less than 10** from (A2, A2)

So worse.

And in (A2, A2), both get 10.

So why would they play this mixed strategy?

Only if (A2, A2) is not credible.

But in (A2, A2), no incentive to deviate.

So rational players will play (A2, A2)

Therefore, the **dominant equilibrium** is both always delegate.

Moreover, **you can guarantee 10 points** by delegating, and any deviation gives less.

So if you are rational, you should **always delegate**.

But what if the other player doesn't?

Then you get less.

But if you play a mixed strategy, and the other does too, you might get less.

But in a **rational, forward-looking** setting, both players will realize that:
- If both delegate → both get 10
- If only one delegates → that one gets 6 or 4 (less than 10)
- If none → at most 10, but expected less

So both will want to **coordinate on delegation**.

Therefore, the optimal **rational strategy** is to **always delegate**.

Thus, **set p2 = 100**, p0 = 0, p1 = 0.

Now, verify:

- You play A2 → delegate
- Assume opponent also plays A2 → both delegate
- → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 10

If opponent deviates to anything:
- A0: only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 6
- A1: only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays A1 → you get 4
- Both worse than 10

So you are better off delegating.

Thus, **best response is to always delegate**, and if both do, it’s stable.

Therefore, optimal strategy is **always delegate**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix (from my perspective as Player 2)

| P1\P2 | A0 | A1 |
|-------|----|----|
| **A0** | 10, 10 | 20, 0 |
| **A1** | 2, 6 | 4, 4 |

(First number is my payoff, second is Player 1's)

## Step 2: Analyze the Basic Game (without delegation)

- If Player 1 plays A0, my best response is A1 (20 > 10)
- If Player 1 plays A1, my best response is A1 (4 > 2)
- A1 strictly dominates A0 for me

The Nash equilibrium without delegation is (A1, A1) giving both players 4 points.

## Step 3: Understand Mediator Behavior

- If only 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1 for that player
- If both players delegate → mediator plays A0 for both

## Step 4: Analyze Delegation Outcomes

When I delegate (A2):
- vs Player 1's A0: Mediator plays A1 for me → I get 20
- vs Player 1's A1: Mediator plays A1 for me → I get 4  
- vs Player 1's A2: Mediator plays A0 for both → **I get 10**

Comparing my options vs Player 1 delegating:
- My A0 vs their A2: I play A0, they play A1 → I get 2
- My A1 vs their A2: I play A1, they play A1 → I get 4
- My A2 vs their A2: Both play A0 → **I get 10**

## Step 5: Identify Nash Equilibria

**(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium:**
- If Player 1 delegates, my payoffs are: A0=2, A1=4, A2=10 → I prefer A2
- If I delegate, Player 1's payoffs are: A0=0, A1=4, A2=10 → They prefer A2

This gives both players 10 points and Pareto dominates the (A1, A1) equilibrium.

## Step 6: Rational Choice

Since (A2, A2) gives both players 10 points versus only 4 points from (A1, A1), and since the mediator was approved by both players (and proposed by me), rational coordination suggests both players should delegate. 

Delegation to the mediator is my strictly dominant response if I expect Player 1 to delegate with high probability, and creates the best outcome for both of us.

response:
Let's approach this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We are Player 1 in a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1, and the following payoffs:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0        | A1        |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| A0                            | (10,10)   | (0,20)    |
| A1                            | (6,2)     | (4,4)     |

We need to analyze this base game to understand incentives.

---

### **Step 2: Find Nash Equilibrium (Pure and Mixed) of the base game**

Let’s suppose both players choose strategies independently.

Let:
- You play A0 with probability `p`
- Other player plays A0 with probability `q`

We’ll look for a symmetric mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium.

---

#### **Best response for you:**

Your expected payoff from playing A0:
- E(A0) = q×10 + (1−q)×0 = 10q

Your expected payoff from playing A1:
- E(A1) = q×6 + (1−q)×4 = 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Set them equal to find indifference:
- 10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So, if the other player plays A0 with 50%, you're indifferent between A0 and A1.

Similarly, in symmetric equilibrium, the other player would also mix with p = 0.5.

So, **in the base game, the unique symmetric mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium is (0.5, 0.5)**.

At this, your expected payoff is:
- E = 0.5×10×0.5 + 0.5×0×0.5 + 0.5×6×0.5 + 0.5×4×0.5
- = 2.5 + 0 + 1.5 + 1 = **5 points**

Wait, let’s double-check expected payoff using indifference:

From above, at q=0.5:
E(A0) = 10×0.5 = 5
E(A1) = 2×0.5 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 → yes, both give 5.

So each player gets **5** expected points in the base game Nash equilibrium.

---

### **Step 3: Introduce the delegation option — A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**

Now, you can choose:
- A0: play A0 yourself
- A1: play A1 yourself
- A2: delegate your move to a mediator

If you delegate, the mediator plays:
- A1 if only **1** player delegates
- A0 if **2** players delegate

So the mediator’s action **depends on how many players delegate**.

Important: You can delegate *or not*, and the other player also can choose to delegate or not.

So there are **4 delegation scenarios**:

| Your Action | Other Player’s Action | Total Delegators | Mediator Plays |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 0                | –              |
| A0          | A1                     | 0                | –              |
| A0          | A2                     | 1                | A1             |
| A1          | A0                     | 0                | –              |
| A1          | A1                     | 0                | –              |
| A1          | A2                     | 1                | A1             |
| A2          | A0                     | 1                | A1             |
| A2          | A1                     | 1                | A1             |
| A2          | A2                     | 2                | A0             |

So if **only one** player delegates, mediator plays A1.
If **both** delegate, mediator plays A0.

That’s key.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze possible outcomes based on delegation**

Let’s think about the **expected payoff** of your strategy depending on what the other player does.

Since we are trying to *maximize* your expected points, and you don't know what the other player will do, we need to consider the **best response** to any rational other player.

But since this is a one-shot game (only one round), we need to choose your probability distribution over A0, A1, A2 that maximizes expected payoff, **assuming the other player is also rational and will do the same**.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium in the game with three actions: A0, A1, A2**.

Let’s define your strategy:
- Let `x` = probability you play A0
- `y` = probability you play A1
- `z` = probability you play A2
- x + y + z = 100% → x + y + z = 1

Similarly, let the other player use strategy:
- `a`: P(A0)
- `b`: P(A1)
- `c`: P(A2)
- a + b + c = 1

But since the game is symmetric (except that the mediator behavior depends on count), and we are asked to choose a strategy, we should consider a **symmetric equilibrium**, where both players use the same strategy.

Let’s assume a symmetric equilibrium: both players use same probabilities x, y, z.

We need to find such a mixed strategy where each action in support gives same expected payoff.

But we don’t know if all three actions are used. So let’s consider which combination might dominate.

---

### **Step 5: Try possible equilibria**

Let’s evaluate whether **delegation (A2)** could be profitable.

#### Case: Both players delegate (z = 1, for both)

Then total delegators = 2 → mediator plays **A0**

So both players get: (A0 vs A0) → **10 points each**

That's **better** than the base game Nash (5 points). Much better.

But if both always delegate, then each is getting 10 points.

But is this stable?

Suppose you deviate: instead of delegating, you play A0.

Then:
- You play A0, other player delegates → only 1 delegator → mediator plays A1
- So your action is A0, other player's action is A1 → outcome: (0,20)

You get **0**, worse than 10.

Similarly, if you played A1 instead of A2:
- You: A1, other: A2 (i.e., A1) → only 1 delegator → mediator plays A1
- So you: A1, other: A1 → (4,4)
- You get 4 < 10 → still worse.

So if the other player delegates, you get less than 10 by playing A0 or A1.

So **delegating is best** if the other player also delegates.

But what if only **one** delegates?

Then mediator plays **A1**

So if you delegate and other plays A0 (no delegation), then:
- You: delegate → mediator plays A1
- Other: A0
- So (A1, A0) → you get **6**, other gets 2

Alternatively, if you delegate and other plays A1:
- You: delegate → mediator plays A1
- Other: A1
- → (A1, A1) → you get 4

So if you delegate and the other does not delegate:
- If other plays A0 → you get 6
- If other plays A1 → you get 4

But the other player can also delegate.

So let's analyze incentive of a single player to delegate.

---

### **Step 6: Consider symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**

Let’s suppose both players use same mixed strategy: with probability `z` they pick A2 (delegate), `x` A0, `y` A1, x+y+z=1.

We’ll suppose symmetric equilibrium and compute expected payoff from each action, given the other player uses the same mixed strategy.

Let’s compute **expected payoff for you choosing each action**, given the other player randomizes with (x,y,z).

But we don't know z yet. Let’s try to solve for symmetry.

Let’s suppose **in equilibrium**, all three actions are played (x>0, y>0, z>0), then each must give same expected payoff.

Let’s compute:

---

#### **Expected payoff from choosing A0 (your action)**

You play A0.

The other player:
- Plays A0 with prob x → outcome: (A0 vs A0) → you get 10
- Plays A1 with prob y → outcome: (A0 vs A1) → you get 0
- Plays A2 (delegate) with prob z → then you are the only delegator? No.

Wait: if you play A0 and other plays A2 → then **only one player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**

So: you play A0, other plays A2 → outcome: you (A0), other (A1) → (0,20)

So in this case, you get 0.

Summary of outcomes when you play A0:

| Other's Action | Outcome (You, Other) | Your Payoff |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| A0 (prob x)    | A0 vs A0 → (10,10)     | 10          |
| A1 (prob y)    | A0 vs A1 → (0,20)      | 0           |
| A2 (prob z)    | You A0, Other A2 → A0 vs A1 → (0,20) → You get 0 | 0 |

So E[A0] = x×10 + y×0 + z×0 = **10x**

---

#### **Expected payoff from choosing A1 (your action)**

You play A1.

| Other's Action | Outcome                | Your Payoff |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| A0 (x)         | A1 vs A0 → (6,2)       | 6           |
| A1 (y)         | A1 vs A1 → (4,4)       | 4           |
| A2 (z)         | You A1, Other A2 → A1 vs A1 (since only one delegator) → (4,4) | 4 |

So E[A1] = x×6 + y×4 + z×4 = 6x + 4y + 4z

Note: When you play A1 and other plays A2, mediator plays A1 → so you and other both act as A1 → (4,4)

---

#### **Expected payoff from choosing A2 (delegate)**

You delegate.

Now, the mediator plays based on **number of delegators**.

So we consider:

- If other plays A0 or A1 → you are the **only** delegator → mediator plays **A1**
- If other plays A2 → both delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So outcomes:

| Other's Action | No. Delegators | Mediator plays | Your action | Other's action | Outcome (You, Other) | Your Payoff |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| A0 (x)         | 1              | A1             | A1          | A0             | (6,2)                  | 6           |
| A1 (y)         | 1              | A1             | A1          | A1             | (4,4)                  | 4           |
| A2 (z)         | 2              | A0             | A0          | A0             | (10,10)                | 10          |

So E[A2] = x×6 + y×4 + z×10

---

### **Step 7: Set up equations for symmetric equilibrium**

In symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium, all actions in support must yield same expected payoff.

Assume all three are played: x>0, y>0, z>0

Then:

E[A0] = E[A1] = E[A2]

So:

1. E[A0] = 10x  
2. E[A1] = 6x + 4y + 4z  
3. E[A2] = 6x + 4y + 10z  

Set E[A0] = E[A1]:

10x = 6x + 4y + 4z  
→ 4x = 4y + 4z  
→ x = y + z  → (Equation 1)

Set E[A0] = E[A2]:

10x = 6x + 4y + 10z  
→ 4x = 4y + 10z  
→ 2x = 2y + 5z → (Equation 2)

Now use x = y + z → plug into Equation 2:

2(y + z) = 2y + 5z  
→ 2y + 2z = 2y + 5z  
→ 2z = 5z → 0 = 3z → z = 0

Contradiction! Because we assumed z > 0.

So **z cannot be > 0** if all three actions are to have same expected payoff.

Therefore, **delegation (A2) cannot be used in equilibrium with A0 and A1**, if equilibrium requires indifference among all three.

But maybe z = 0? Or maybe A2 is best only if others do the same.

From earlier: if both delegate, you get 10 — better than base game.

So perhaps **there is a symmetric pure strategy equilibrium where both players delegate (z=1)**?

Let’s test that.

---

### **Step 8: Check if (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**

If both players play A2 (delegate), then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0
- Outcome: (A0, A0) → (10,10)

Now, suppose you deviate to A0: you play A0, other plays A2 → only one delegator → mediator plays A1
- So you: A0, other: A1 → (0,20) → you get 0 < 10 → worse

Deviate to A1: you play A1, other plays A2 → mediator plays A1 → (A1 vs A1) → (4,4) → you get 4 < 10

So **no profitable deviation**.

Therefore, **(A2, A2) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium**, and each player gets 10.

In contrast, the base game Nash gives only 5.

So this is much better.

But is this the **only** equilibrium?

Also, are there asymmetric equilibria?

But since both players are symmetric, and the mediator depends only on count, symmetric equilibria are plausible.

Could there be a mixed strategy with z=0? That is, no delegation.

Then we are back to base game: best mixed equilibrium gives 5.

But 5 < 10, so players prefer to delegate.

So (A2, A2) is **strictly better** than any base game equilibrium.

Moreover, we just showed that **it is a Nash equilibrium**.

Now, could there be another equilibrium where players mix?

Suppose z is small.

But if one player delegates, the other might want to do the same to get 10.

In fact, **if both players delegate, both get 10 — which is the best possible outcome**.

And deviation hurts.

Therefore, **(A2, A2) is a strong equilibrium**.

Moreover, if both players are rational and recognize this, they will both choose A2.

So **the optimal strategy is to delegate with 100% probability**.

But let’s confirm if there are other equilibria where, say, some mix.

Suppose both players use z < 1.

But then, from earlier, when we assumed symmetric mixed, we ended up with z=0.

So no symmetric mixed equilibrium with z>0.

What about asymmetric?

Suppose you play A2 with high probability, other plays something else.

But since both are rational, and the situation is symmetric, they should both do the same.

Moreover, suppose the other player plays A0.

Then if you play A2: you delegate, other plays A0 → only one delegator → mediator plays A1 → outcome: (A0, A1) → you get 0

If you play A0: (A0, A0) → 10

So you get 10 > 0 → better not to delegate.

Similarly, if other plays A1: you get 4 vs 4 if you delegate → same? Wait:

- You delegate, other plays A1 → only one delegator → mediator plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4
- You play A1 → (A1, A1) → also get 4

So same.

But if other plays A0: you get 10 if you play A0, but only 0 if you delegate → so you prefer not to delegate.

So if the other player plays A0, you want to play A0.

But if the other plays A0, you don’t want to delegate.

But if you don’t delegate, and they play A0, you get 10.

But if they also see that you don’t delegate, they might want to avoid giving you 10.

But the outcome (A0, A0) is symmetric — both get 10.

Wait: if you play A0 and other plays A0 → both get 10.

But if you deviate to A1 when other plays A0 → you get 6 < 10 → worse.

So if other plays A0, you prefer to play A0.

Similarly, if other plays A1, you get 0 if you play A0, or 4 if you play A1 — so you prefer A1.

But if both play A0, both get 10.

But in that case, is that an equilibrium?

Let’s check: if other plays A0, you best respond with A0 → get 10.

Similarly, other gets 10 if they play A0.

So (A0, A0) is a pure Nash equilibrium.

But payoff is 10 for both.

Similarly, is (A1, A1) equilibrium?

- If other plays A1, you get 0 if you play A0, 4 if you play A1 → so best response is A1 → yes.

- So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium → payoff 4 each.

Similarly, (A0, A1): you get 0, if you deviate to A1 you get 6 → worse? No: you're getting 0, but if you play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4 > 0 → so you want to deviate.

So not equilibrium.

Similarly, (A1, A0): you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 6. If you deviate to A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10 > 6 → so you want to deviate.

So only pure equilibria without delegation are:
- (A0, A0): 10 points each
- (A1, A1): 4 points each

But now with delegation, we have:
- (A2, A2): 10 points each → better than (A1, A1), same as (A0, A0)

But (A2, A2) is stable.

Now, can a mix between (A0, A0) and (A2, A2) happen?

But the key is: in (A0, A0), no delegation is used.

In (A2, A2), both delegate.

But if both players are expected to play (A2, A2), and it’s a Nash equilibrium, and it gives 10 — same as (A0, A0), but better than others.

Why would anyone deviate?

But now, **if you believe the other player will delegate**, then you are better off delegating yourself (to get 10), as we saw earlier.

Similarly, if you think they won’t delegate, you might prefer not to, but if they are rational, they won’t choose A1 either.

In fact, **(A2, A2) is a focal point** because:
- It leads to (A0, A0) outcome — which is already a Nash equilibrium in base game
- But here, you achieve it via delegation
- No risk: both get 10, and no incentive to deviate

In contrast, (A0, A0) requires both to play A0 without delegation — but if one is unsure, maybe delegates?

But under delegation, you don’t even have to play — it’s automatic.

So **(A2, A2) is a stable, rational choice**.

Moreover, it is a **strict Nash equilibrium**: any deviation gives strictly less payoff.

Thus, both players should play A2 with probability 100%.

---

### **Final Decision**

To maximize your expected points, you should **delegate with probability 100%**, assuming the other player is rational and will also delegate.

Thus, your strategy is:

- A0: 0%
- A1: 0%
- A2: 100%

This gives you 10 points, and no other strategy gives more in equilibrium.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's work through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Basic Game (Without Delegation)**

We are Player 2. The payoff matrix (from Player 2's perspective) is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0          | A1          |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **A0**              | (10, 10)    | (2, 6)      |
| **A1**              | (20, 0)     | (4, 4)      |

Note: First number = Player 2's payoff, second = Player 1's.

So:
- If both play A0: (10, 10)
- Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 plays A0: (20, 0)
- Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 plays A1: (2, 6)
- Both play A1: (4, 4)

Now, we analyze this game as a standard 2-player simultaneous-move game.

---

### **Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium (Basic Game)**

Let’s find mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSE) for the base game.

Let:
- Player 1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)
- Player 2 play A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q)

We want to find q that makes Player 1 indifferent between A0 and A1, and vice versa.

But wait — we are **Player 2**, and we are allowed to **delegate** to a mediator. This changes things.

So we need to include **action A2: Delegate to Mediator**.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

There is a **third action: A2** — "Delegate to Mediator".

If you delegate:
- The mediator will **play A1 if only one player delegates**
- The mediator will **play A0 if both players delegate**

So the mediator's action depends on **how many players choose to delegate**.

Let’s clarify:
- If **only you** delegate (i.e., you choose A2, and Player 1 chooses A0 or A1), then the mediator plays **A1** (because only one player delegated).
- If **both** players delegate (you and Player 1 both choose A2), then the mediator plays **A0** (because two players delegated).
- If **no one delegates**, then no one uses the mediator; each plays independently.

Importantly:
- If you delegate, you **do not** choose A0 or A1 — the mediator chooses for you.
- So if you choose A2, your action is determined by the mediator’s rule based on joint delegation.

Also, we are **Player 2**, and we don’t know what Player 1 will do. We must choose a **probability distribution over A0, A1, A2**.

Let’s define:
- Let x = P(Player 2 chooses A0)
- Let y = P(Player 2 chooses A1)
- Let z = P(Player 2 chooses A2)  
→ with x + y + z = 100

Similarly, let:
- a = P(Player 1 chooses A0)
- b = P(Player 1 chooses A1)
- c = P(Player 1 chooses A2)  
→ a + b + c = 100

But since we are only choosing our own strategy, and Player 1 is another player (who also acts optimally), we need to **consider best responses**, and seek **equilibrium** — most likely a symmetric or stable mixed strategy.

But the **mediator’s behavior depends on the total number of delegators**, so we need to evaluate the **expected payoff** to Player 2 **as a function of our strategy and an assumed strategy of Player 1**, and find our optimal mix.

We assume that **both players are rational and trying to maximize their own payoff**.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** involving the three actions: A0, A1, A2.

---

### **Step 4: Consider What Happens in Each Case**

Let’s consider the **four possible delegation scenarios**:

#### Case 1: No one delegates (Player 1 and Player 2 both choose A0 or A1 only)
- Then it's just the original game.

#### Case 2: Only Player 2 delegates (you choose A2, Player 1 chooses A0 or A1)
- Then only one player has delegated → mediator plays A1
- So **Player 2's action becomes A1**
- Player 1’s action is A0 or A1 (as chosen by them)
- So this is equivalent to: Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 plays whatever

#### Case 3: Only Player 1 delegates (you choose A0/A1, Player 1 chooses A2)
- Only one player delegates → mediator plays A1
- So **Player 2’s action is determined by your choice**, not the mediator → you still play A0 or A1
- Player 1 plays A1 (because mediator plays A1 for them)

#### Case 4: Both delegate (you and Player 1 both choose A2)
- Two players delegate → mediator plays A0
- So both players play A0 (mediator assigns A0 to both)

So let's summarize what action each player ends up playing in each joint choice:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|---------------------|----|----|----|
| **A0**              | A0, A0 | A0, A1 | A0, A1 |
| **A1**              | A1, A0 | A1, A1 | A1, A1 |
| **A2**              | A1, A0 | A1, A1 | A0, A0 |

Wait — clarify:

- If **you choose A2**, then:
  - If Player 1 **doesn't** delegate: only one delegator → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
  - If Player 1 **does** delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0

- If **Player 1 chooses A2**, then:
  - If you **don't** delegate: only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
  - If you **do** delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → Player 1 plays A0

So the **effective actions** are:

- (A0, A0) → both play A0
- (A0, A1) → you play A0, Player 1 plays A1
- (A1, A0) → you play A1, Player 1 plays A0
- (A1, A1) → you play A1, Player 1 plays A1
- (A2, A0) → you play A1 (since only you delegated), Player 1 plays A0 → (A1, A0)
- (A2, A1) → you play A1 (only you delegated), Player 1 plays A1 → (A1, A1)
- (A0, A2) → you play A0, Player 1 plays A1 → (A0, A1)
- (A1, A2) → you play A1, Player 1 plays A1 → (A1, A1)
- (A2, A2) → both play A0 → (A0, A0)

Therefore, we can define the **effective action pairs** depending on player choices.

Let’s now define expected payoff to Player 2, as a function of the joint probabilities.

But to find a best strategy, we can look for **a symmetric equilibrium** or **try to reason through dominant strategies**, but given complexity, let's consider **whether delegation is ever optimal**.

---

### **Step 5: Compare Payoffs for Different Scenarios**

Let’s suppose **Player 1 acts optimally too**, and we are looking for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

Let’s suppose we consider whether **delegation (A2)** can be part of an equilibrium.

Try to see what happens if both players are indifferent between delegation and other actions.

Let’s analyze **expected payoff of A2**, assuming Player 1 has a strategy (a, b, c).

But better: try to find a **symmetric equilibrium** where both players use the same strategy.

Let’s suppose both players use a mixed strategy:
- P(A0) = p
- P(A1) = q
- P(A2) = r
With p + q + r = 1

But since the mediator depends on the number of delegators, and the actions change depending on that, we need expected payoff.

Let’s instead suppose **both players are symmetric** — that is, they use the same strategy.

We are Player 2, but if we assume symmetry, we can find equilibrium where both players do the same.

Let’s try to find such an equilibrium.

Let’s suppose both players use:
- P(A0) = p
- P(A1) = q
- P(A2) = r
With p + q + r = 1

Now compute expected payoff to Player 2.

But before that, think: **What would a rational player do?**

Let’s evaluate **expected payoff of A2**, assuming Player 1 plays some strategy.

But we need to reason about equilibrium.

Let’s suppose that **in equilibrium, neither player deviates from the strategy**.

Let’s test a possible candidate: **both players delegate (A2) with probability r**.

Let’s try a simple candidate strategy: **both players choose A2 with probability 1**.

- Then both delegate → mediator plays A0 on both → both play A0
- Payoff: (10, 10)

Now, can a player deviate profitably?

Suppose Player 2 considers playing A0 instead, while Player 1 still plays A2.

- Player 1 is delegating → only one delegator → mediator plays A1 for Player 1 → Player 1 plays A1
- Player 2 plays A0
- So effective actions: (A0, A1)
- Payoff to Player 2: 2

But 2 < 10 → worse.

If Player 2 plays A1 instead: (A1, A1), payoff = 4 < 10 → worse.

So deviating to A0 or A1 gives only 2 or 4, worse than 10.

So both players get 10, and cannot do better by deviating.

So **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium?** Yes — if both choose A2, both get 10, and no unilateral deviation improves payoff.

But is that the **only** equilibrium?

What if both choose A0? Then both get 10.

If one deviates to A1: payoff becomes 20, better! So (A0, A0) is not stable.

(A1, A0): Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0

If Player 1 deviates to A0: gets 10 > 0 → so not equilibrium.

(A1, A1): both get 4

If Player 2 deviates to A0: then (A0, A1) → Player 2 gets 2 < 4 → worse

If Player 2 deviates to A2: then Player 1 still plays A1, so only Player 2 delegates → mediator plays A1 → so Player 2 plays A1 → effective actions: (A1, A1) → same as before → payoff 4

Same → so deviation gives no gain

But if Player 1 does nothing, and Player 2 plays A2 instead of A1: then Player 2 becomes A1 (since only one delegate), Player 1 plays A1 → same as before → same payoff

So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium? Let's check.

- Both play A1 → payoff (4,4)

If Player 2 changes to A0: (A0, A1) → payoff 2 < 4 → worse

If Player 2 changes to A2: mediator plays A1 (only one delegate) → Player 2 plays A1 → still (A1, A1) → same payoff = 4 → so no gain

So no incentive to deviate → so **(A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium**, but gives lower payoff than (A2,A2)

But in (A2,A2), both get 10 — better than (A1,A1)

But is (A2,A2) really stable? We checked: if one player deviates to A0 or A1, they get 2 or 4 < 10 → so yes, it is stable.

But is there a **mixed strategy equilibrium**?

Let’s suppose that **both players use a mixed strategy including A2**.

But in the case of (A2,A2), it's a pure strategy equilibrium with high payoff.

But here's a twist: **What if Player 1 doesn’t want to delegate?**

Wait — in (A2,A2), both get 10.

But suppose Player 1 thinks: "If I play A0, and Player 2 plays A2, then I play A1 (since only one delegate) → so (A1, A1) → I get 4"

But (A2,A2) gives me 10, which is better.

So yes, stable.

But could there be a **symmetric mixed equilibrium**?

Let’s suppose both players use:
- A0 with probability p
- A1 with probability q
- A2 with probability r, p+q+r=1

Now, compute Player 2’s expected payoff conditional on each of their choices.

We want a strategy where Player 2 is **indifferent** between actions (if they are used in equilibrium), or each action in support gives same payoff.

But since (A2, A2) is a pure strategy equilibrium giving 10, and deviating gives less, it seems **better than any other equilibrium**.

But is it **the only one**?

Wait — suppose Player 2 is unsure. Can we have a **mixed equilibrium** where A2 is used?

Let’s suppose that **Player 1 uses A2 with high probability or mixed**.

But to maximize our payoff, we want the strategy that gives the highest expected payoff in equilibrium.

Now, the question is: **If both players are rational and trying to maximize their own payoff, what will they do?**

(A2,A2) gives 10 to both — and it's a mutual best response.

But is there an incentive to deviate?

Suppose Player 2 uses a mixed strategy including A2.

But let’s suppose Player 1 believes that Player 2 will play A2.

Then Player 1’s best response:

- If Player 2 plays A2, then:
  - If Player 1 plays A0: then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
  - Then actions: (A2, A0) → you play A1 (since you delegated, only one delegate), Player 1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4, Player 1 gets 4
  - But wait: if you play A2, and Player 1 plays A0, then:
    - You: delegate → only one delegator → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
    - Player 1: plays A0
    - So outcome: (A1, A0) → Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0

Ah! Important point!

Let’s recompute:

If you play **A2**, and Player 1 plays **A0**:
- You delegate → only one delegate (you) → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Player 1 plays A0
- So (A1, A0) → payoff to **Player 2**: **20**, Player 1: 0

Similarly, if you play A2, Player 1 plays A1:
- Only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Player 1 plays A1
- So (A1, A1) → you get 4

If Player 1 plays A2:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10

So if **Player 2 plays A2**, then:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20
- If Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4
- If Player 1 plays A2 → you get 10

So your expected payoff depends on Player 1’s action.

Similarly, if you play A0:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → (A0, A0): 10
- If Player 1 plays A1 → (A0, A1): 2
- If Player 1 plays A2 → (A0, A1): 2 (because Player 1 plays A1)

If you play A1:
- A0 → 20
- A1 → 4
- A2 → (A1, A0) → wait: Player 1 plays A2 → only one delegate → so Player 1 plays A1 → you play A1 → (A1, A1) → 4

So for Player 2:

| Your Action | Player 1's Action | Your Payoff |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| A0         | A0               | 10          |
| A0         | A1               | 2           |
| A0         | A2               | 2           |
| A1         | A0               | 20          |
| A1         | A1               | 4           |
| A1         | A2               | 4           |
| A2         | A0               | 20          |
| A2         | A1               | 4           |
| A2         | A2               | 10          |

Now, **if Player 1 chooses A0**, then:
- A0: 10
- A1: 20
- A2: 20
→ So best responses: A1 or A2

If Player 1 chooses A1:
- A0: 2
- A1: 4
- A2: 4
→ Best response: A1 or A2

If Player 1 chooses A2:
- A0: 2
- A1: 4
- A2: 10
→ Best response: A2

So Player 2’s best response depends on Player 1’s strategy.

Now let’s suppose **Player 1 is using a strategy where they play A2 with some probability**.

Let’s suppose **Player 1 plays A2 with high probability**, say 1. Then Player 2’s best response is A2 → get 10

But if Player 1 plays A0 with positive probability, Player 2 might prefer A1 or A2.

Now, let’s suppose **both players use the same mixed strategy**.

Let’s assume symmetry: both players use:
- P(A0) = p
- P(A1) = q
- P(A2) = r
with p + q + r = 1

Let’s compute **Player 2's expected payoff from each action**, given that Player 1 uses (p, q, r)

---

### **Step 6: Compute Expected Payoff for Each Action**

Let’s compute **E[Payoff | Action A0]**, **E[Payoff | A1]**, **E[Payoff | A2]**

First, **P(Player 1 chooses A0) = p**, P(A1) = q, P(A2) = r

But note: the outcome depends on **joint action**, and also on **how many delegate**.

So for **Player 2 choosing A0**:

- If Player 1 chooses A0: (A0,A0) → payoff 10
- If Player 1 chooses A1: (A0,A1) → payoff 2
- If Player 1 chooses A2: (A0,A1) → payoff 2 (since Player 1 plays A1)

So expected payoff from A0:
E0 = p×10 + q×2 + r×2 = 10p + 2q + 2r

Similarly, for **A1**:
- If Player 1 A0: (A1,A0) → payoff 20
- A1: (A1,A1) → 4
- A2: (A1,A1) → 4
→ E1 = p×20 + q×4 + r×4 = 20p + 4q + 4r

For **A2**:
- If Player 1 A0: (A1,A0) → payoff 20 (since you play A1)
- A1: (A1,A1) → 4
- A2: (A0,A0) → 10 (both play A0)
→ E2 = p×20 + q×4 + r×10

Now, in equilibrium, if a player uses a mixed strategy, the expected utilities for all actions in support must be **equal**.

Let’s suppose that all three actions are used (p>0, q>0, r>0), then:
E0 = E1 = E2

So:
10p + 2q + 2r = 20p + 4q + 4r = 20p + 4q + 10r

Set E0 = E1:
10p + 2q + 2r = 20p + 4q + 4r  
→ -10p -2q -2r = 0  
→ 10p + 2q + 2r = 0 → impossible since p,q,r ≥ 0

Wait: left side is positive, right side is same? No:

From:
10p + 2q + 2r = 20p + 4q + 4r  
→ subtract left: 0 = 10p + 2q + 2r  
→ 10p + 2q + 2r = 0 → only possible if p=q=r=0 → contradiction

So E0 = E1 implies 10p + 2q + 2r = 20p + 4q + 4r → 0 = 10p + 2q + 2r → impossible unless p=q=r=0.

But p+q+r=1.

So E0 < E1 always.

Because 10p + 2q + 2r < 20p + 4q + 4r → unless p=q=r=0, but then not possible.

So E1 > E0 for all p,q,r.

So **A0 is strictly dominated** by either A1 or A2 — we can never want to play A0 if we can play A1 or A2.

Therefore, in any equilibrium, **P(A0) = 0**

So q + r = 1

Now only A1 and A2 are used.

Now compute E1 and E2:

E1 = 20p + 4q + 4r = 20×0 + 4q + 4r = 4(q + r) = 4

Since q + r = 1

E2 = 20p + 4q + 10r = 0 + 4q + 10r

But q = 1 - r

So E2 = 4(1 - r) + 10r = 4 - 4r + 10r = 4 + 6r

So E2 = 4 + 6r > 4 = E1 for all r > 0

So E2 > E1 whenever r > 0

Therefore, if r > 0, E2 > E1

And if r = 0, then q = 1, E1 = 4, E2 = 4

But if r = 0, then E2 = 4, E1 = 4 → same

But if r > 0, E2 > E1

So to make Player 2 indifferent, we need E1 = E2

But E1 = 4

E2 = 4 + 6r

Set equal: 4 + 6r = 4 → r = 0

So only when r = 0, E1 = E2

Otherwise, E2 > E1

Therefore, **Player 2 prefers to play A2 over A1 unless r = 0**

But r is the probability that Player 1 plays A2

So in equilibrium, if Player 1 plays A2 with positive probability, then E2 > E1, so Player 2 wants to play A2

But if both play A2 with positive probability, then r > 0, so Player 2 strictly prefers A2

But then r should be 1 → so both play A2 with probability 1

But **(A2,A2)** is an equilibrium, as we saw earlier:
- Each gets 10
- If one deviates:
  - To A0: gets 2 < 10
  - To A1: gets 4 < 10
- So no incentive

And since E2 > E1 when r > 0, and in (A2,A2), r = 1 → E2 = 10, E1 = 4 → even better

So **(A2, A2) is the unique symmetric equilibrium?**

But what if Player 1 plays A0?

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability 1.

Then Player 2’s best response:
- A0: 10
- A1: 20
- A2: 20

So best response is A1 or A2 (both give 20)

But if both play A1, each gets 4.

Let’s check if (A1, A1) is equilibrium:
- If Player 2 deviates to A0: gets 2 < 4 → worse
- To A2: gets 4 (since if you play A2, Player 1 plays A1 → only one delegate → you play A1 → same) → same payoff
- So no incentive → so (A1,A1) is equilibrium

But payoff is only 4 < 10

Similarly, (A1, A2): Player 1 plays A2 → only one delegate → Player 1 plays A1 → (A1,A1) → you get 4, Player 1 gets 4

But if Player 1 plays A2, and you play A1, you get 4

If you play A0: 2

If you play A2: 10 → better!

But if you play A2, and Player 1 plays A2, both play A0 → you get 10 > 4

So if Player 1 plays A2, you get 10 by playing A2, but only 4 by playing A1

So you prefer A2

Therefore, **if Player 1 plays A2, you should play A2**

Similarly, if Player 1 plays A0, you can get 20 by playing A1 or A2

But if you play A2, and Player 1 plays A0, you get 20

But if Player 1 deviates to A2, then you both get 10 — worse for Player 1?

Wait: Player 1: if they play A0, and you play A2, then (A1, A0) → Player 1 gets 0

If Player 1 plays A2, then both get 10

So Player 1 gets 0 vs 10 → so Player 1 **wants to play A2**

But if Player 1 plays A0, they get 0 → worse than 10

So Player 1 has incentive to play A2

Similarly, Player 2 gets 10 from A2, 20 from playing A2 when Player 1 plays A0, but if Player 1 plays A2, Player 2 gets 10

But if Player 1 plays A0, and Player 2 plays A2, Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0 → Player 1 can increase payoff by switching to A2

So **in any deviation where Player 1 plays A0**, they can get 0, but by switching to A2, get 10

So Player 1 will never play A0 in equilibrium — it's dominated

Similarly, **A0 is strictly dominated** for Player 1 as well.

In fact, for any action, P(A0) = 0 in equilibrium.

Therefore, in any equilibrium, both players play only A1 or A2.

And since E2 > E1 when r > 0, and r > 0 if any player plays A2, so both players will want to play A2

So the only stable equilibrium is **(A2, A2)** — both play A2 with probability 1.

Any deviation gives less payoff.

Moreover, (A1,A1) is also an equilibrium but worse.

And no mixed strategy equilibria exist in the interior because E0 < E1 < E2 when r > 0.

But to be thorough, suppose **Player 1 plays only A1** (r=0). Then E1 = 4, E2 = 4 → Player 2 is indifferent

But then Player 1’s payoff in (A1,A1) is 4, and if Player 1 deviates to A2, gets 4 (same), but if Player 2 plays A1, and Player 1 plays A2, then only one delegate → Player 1 plays A1 → (A1,A1) → same payoff

So no incentive

But if Player 1 plays A2, they could get 10 if Player 2 also plays A2

But if they believe Player 2 plays A1, then playing A2 gives 4, same as A1

But if Player 2 is playing A1, then Player 1 gets 4 regardless

But if Player 1 believes Player 2 might play A2, they prefer A2

But in the symmetric equilibrium (A2,A2), both get 10, which is better

So **(A2,A2) is the most attractive equilibrium**

And since it's a strict Nash equilibrium (no incentive to deviate), it is evolutionarily stable.

Therefore, **rational players will play A2 with probability 1**

So the optimal strategy is to play **A2 with 100%**.

### **Final Step: Output the Strategy**

We are Player 2.

Optimal strategy: play A2 with probability 100%

So:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

Sum = 100 → valid.

And this maximizes our payoff at 10, and is secure against deviation.

### ✅ Final Answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}
