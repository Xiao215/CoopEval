Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

response:
To maximize points in this game, we should aim for an outcome with the highest total points, which is 20 (resulting from (A0, A0) or (A0, A1)). The original game has a Nash Equilibrium at (A1, A1), where both players receive 4 points.

By proposing a contract, we can shift the Nash Equilibrium. Let the contract be defined by the extra payoff $\{A0: x, A1: y\}$. If Player 1 plays action $a_1$ and Player 2 plays $a_2$, Player 1 receives $C(a_1) - C(a_2)$ and Player 2 receives $C(a_2) - C(a_1)$. These additional payments are zero-sum.

Let $z = x - y$. The new payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (z, 20 - z)
- (A1, A0): (6 - z, 2 + z)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

To make (A0, A0) a dominant strategy for both players:
1. For Player 1 to prefer A0:
   - Against A0: $10 > 6 - z \implies z > -4$
   - Against A1: $z > 4$
2. For Player 2 to prefer A0:
   - Against A0: $10 > 20 - z \implies z > 10$
   - Against A1: $2 + z > 4 \implies z > 2$

The most restrictive condition is $z > 10$. If we set $z = 11$, the Nash Equilibrium becomes (A0, A0), and both players receive 10 points. Since 10 points is greater than the 4 points they would receive in the original game's equilibrium, both players have a strong incentive to approve this contract. To achieve $z = 11$, we can set $A0 = 11$ and $A1 = 0$.

{"A0": 11, "A1": 0}

response:
To maximize points as Player 2, we first analyze the original payoff matrix:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20) — (P1 gets 0, P2 gets 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2) — (P1 gets 6, P2 gets 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Without a contract, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) with 4 points each. By proposing a contract, we can shift the equilibrium to a more efficient outcome. The total available points are maximized (20) at (A0, A0), (A0, A1), or (A1, A0). The most stable and fair outcome for both players to agree on is (A0, A0), where they both receive 10 points.

Let the contract specify an additional payment $x$ for action A0 and $y$ for action A1. The bonus system means if P1 chooses $a_1$ and P2 chooses $a_2$, P2's net gain is $C(a_2) - C(a_1)$. Let $d = C(A0) - C(A1)$.
P2's payoffs with contract:
- (A0, A0): $10$
- (A0, A1): $20 - d$
- (A1, A0): $2 + d$
- (A1, A1): $4$

P1's payoffs with contract:
- (A0, A0): $10$
- (A0, A1): $d$
- (A1, A0): $6 - d$
- (A1, A1): $4$

To make (A0, A0) the Nash Equilibrium, neither player should want to deviate to A1:
- P1 prefers A0 over A1 (if P2=A0): $10 > 6 - d \Rightarrow d > -4$
- P2 prefers A0 over A1 (if P1=A0): $10 > 20 - d \Rightarrow d > 10$

Thus, choosing $d > 10$ makes (A0, A0) the dominant strategy for both players, leading to a stable payoff of 10 points each. This is significantly better than the 4 points obtained without a contract. A simple value such as $d = 12$ (by setting $A0 = 12$ and $A1 = 0$) ensures these conditions are met. Under this contract, both players have a rational incentive to approve the contract as it increases their guaranteed payoff from 4 to 10.

```json
{"A0": 12, "A1": 0}

To move the outcome from the original equilibrium \((A1,A1)\) (where you get 4) to the better outcome \((A0,A0)\) (where you get 10), the contract should make **A0 strictly better than A1 for both players regardless of what the other does** (i.e., make A0 a dominant action).

With a contract value \(v(\cdot)\) that depends only on a player’s own action, in a 2-player game each player’s *net* contract adjustment is:
\[
\text{adjustment} = v(\text{own action}) - v(\text{other's action})
\]
So what matters is the difference \(v(A0)-v(A1)\). We need it large enough that, even when the other plays \(A0\), Player 2 prefers \(A0\) over their tempting deviation to \(A1\) (which yields 20 in the base game). The condition is:
\[
10 \ge 20 + v(A1) - v(A0) \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; v(A0)-v(A1) \ge 11 \text{ (to be strict)}
\]
Choosing \(v(A0)=11, v(A1)=0\) makes **A0 strictly dominant for both players**, yielding the unique equilibrium \((A0,A0)\) with payoffs still \((10,10)\) (since transfers cancel when both pick the same action). This is also attractive for the other player versus the original (4).

response:
To design a contract that incentivizes cooperation and maximizes total points for Player 1, let's analyze the current payoff matrix and find a way to make cooperation the most appealing option.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Payoff Matrix:**
    ```
    P1\ P2   | A0            | A1
    ------------------------------
    A0       | (10, 10)      | (0, 20)
    A1       | (6, 2)        | (4, 4)
    ```

2. **Preferred Outcomes:**
    - **(A0, A0)** is jointly optimal with (10, 10).
    - **(A0, A1)** and **(A1, A0)** are non-cooperative outcomes.
    - **(A1, A1)** is a non-dominant equilibrium (both get 4).

3. **Objective:**
   - We want to make choosing **A0** more appealing than **A1**.
   - Ideally, we both want to end up with **A0, A0** payoff since it's Pareto optimal.

4. **Constraints:**
    - Both players need to accept the contract.
    - The contract must be such that everyone finds it beneficial over the original payoff.

5. **Contract Design:**
   - Positive incentives for choosing A0: Encourage cooperation.
   - Additional penalties for choosing A1: Discourage non-cooperation.
   - Make it neutral overall i.e., sum of payments/transfers should be zero to simplify acceptance.

### Proposed Contract:
- **A0** should be attractive with additional positive points.
- **A1** should be less attractive with penalties.

Here's a possible contract in JSON format that can work:

```json
{"A0": +5, "A1": -5}
```

### Explanation:
- If both accept this contract:
    - **(A0, A0)**: Each player receives an additional +5 points.
      - Player 1: 10 + 5 = 15
      - Player 2: 10 + 5 = 15
    - **(A0, A1)**: Player choosing A0 gets additional +5 points, and the one choosing A1 loses -5 points.
      - Player 1: 0 + 5 = 5
      - Player 2: 20 - 5 = 15
    - **(A1, A0)**: Player choosing A1 loses -5 points, and the one choosing A0 gets additional +5 points.
      - Player 1: 6 - 5 = 1
      - Player 2: 2 + 5 = 7
    - **(A1, A1)**: Both lose -5 points.
      - Player 1: 4 - 5 = -1
      - Player 2: 4 - 5 = -1

### Rationale:
- This setup offers a clear incentive for both players to prefer choosing **A0**.
- Choosing **A1** leads to a net negative impact, thus ensuring cooperation as the most beneficial option.

### Final Output:
The proposed contract in JSON:

```json
{"A0": 5, "A1": -5}
```

This contract should align both players' interests towards choosing **A0** and cooperating for mutual benefit.

response:
To design an optimal payment contract for the given game, let's break down the problem into smaller steps for a clearer understanding and solution.

### Step 1: Analyze the Payoff Matrix
First, evaluate the given payoffs for each combination of actions.
- If both choose A0: (Player 2: 10, Player 1: 10)
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: (Player 2: 20, Player 1: 0)
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: (Player 2: 2, Player 1: 6)
- If both choose A1: (Player 2: 4, Player 1: 4)

### Step 2: Identify the Primary Objective
Your goal, as Player 2, is to maximize your own point total. Ideally, we want to create a contract that encourages choosing strategies that lead to higher total payoffs. 

### Step 3: Determine the Strategy with Highest Payoff
By observing the payoffs, it is clear that:
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: this combination yields the highest payoff for you (20 points).
- However, it's unlikely that Player 1 will agree to a scenario where they get 0 points regularly. Thus, we should aim for a more balanced approach that incentivizes Player 1 to cooperate.

### Step 4: Creating the Incentive
Given the payoff matrix, an effective strategy would balance both players' incentives to achieve a cooperative high payoff. Traditionally, mutual cooperation (like both choosing A0) yields a decent payoff for both players.

To encourage Player 1 to choose A0, we can propose an additional payment for this action. Likewise, we can decrease the relative attractiveness of less desirable outcomes.

### Step 5: Design the Contract
Let’s suggest a positive incentive for choosing A0 and a penalty for choosing A1. This can make A0 more attractive, harmonizing with cooperative strategies:
- For Player 2 (you): 
  - A0: Reward (positive payment to stabilize cooperation)
  - A1: Neutral (no need to extra incentivize it, it already has clear benefits)
- For Player 1 (other player):
  - A0: Reward to make mutual A0 more stable (ensuring cooperation)
  - A1: Penalty to discourage non-cooperative actions
  
Here is the contract proposal:
```json
{
  "A0": 5,
  "A1": 0
}
```

### Step 6: Justify the Proposal
- By giving an additional 5 points for A0, it makes cooperation more worthwhile and stabilizes both players choosing A0.
- Since A1 yields a high payoff for you but can be risky due to the heavy loss potential (if the other player chooses A1), we avoid additional incentives to maintain balance.

### Conclusion
The proposed contract makes mutual cooperation more attractive without excessively penalizing or incentivizing extreme actions. Hence, the contract is likely to be agreeable and effective:

```json
{"A0": 5, "A1": 0}
```

This creates a strong enough incentive for mutual cooperation without heavily altering the game's dynamics.

    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game without a contract

Let me examine the payoff matrix from my (Player 1) perspective:
- If opponent plays A0: I get 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → A0 is better
- If opponent plays A1: I get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → A1 is better

From the opponent's perspective:
- If I play A0: They get 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → A1 is better
- If I play A1: They get 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → A1 is better

**Nash Equilibrium without contract:** (A1, A1) = (4, 4)
- The opponent has A1 as a dominant strategy

**Social optimum:** (A0, A0) = (10, 10)
- Much better for both players, but unstable without coordination

## Step 2: Design a contract to improve outcomes

The key issue is the opponent will defect to A1 when I play A0. I need to make my A0 play attractive enough that even when they respond with A1, we're both better off than the Nash equilibrium.

## Step 3: Test a contract

Let me try: **A0: +10, A1: 0**

This means when I play A0, I receive an additional 10 points from the opponent.

Modified payoffs would be:
- (A0, A0): Me: 10+10=20, Opponent: 10-10=0
- (A0, A1): Me: 0+10=10, Opponent: 20-10=10
- (A1, A0): Me: 6, Opponent: 2
- (A1, A1): Me: 4, Opponent: 4

New Nash equilibrium:
- For me: A0 is now dominant (20>6 and 10>4)
- For opponent: Given I play A0, they prefer A1 (10>0)

**Outcome:** (A0, A1) = (10, 10)

## Step 4: Verify this is acceptable

- Both players get 10 instead of 4 → +6 points each
- Both players should approve since it's mutually beneficial
- The contract successfully coordinates us to a better outcome

{"A0": 10, "A1": 0}

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game without a contract

As Player 2, my payoffs are:
- (A0, Other A0): 10
- (A1, Other A0): 20 
- (A0, Other A1): 2
- (A1, Other A1): 4

Other player's payoffs:
- (Other A0, A0): 10
- (Other A0, A1): 0
- (Other A1, A0): 6
- (Other A1, A1): 4

**Key observation**: A1 strictly dominates A0 for me (20>10 and 4>2). The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) yielding (4, 4). However, (A0, A0) yields (10, 10) - much better for both!

## Step 2: Identify the problem

This is a prisoner's dilemma. When the other player plays A0, I'm tempted to deviate to A1 and get 20 instead of 10. We need a contract to make cooperation stable.

## Step 3: Design the contract

To make (A0, A0) an equilibrium, I need to eliminate my incentive to deviate from A0 when the other player cooperates.

Currently: A1 gives me 20 vs A0 giving me 10 (a 10-point advantage)

If I penalize A1 by -10, then:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 0 = 10 for me, 10 - 0 = 10 for other
- (A1, A0): 20 - 10 = 10 for me, 0 + 10 = 10 for other
- (A0, A1): 2 + 0 = 2 for me, 6 - 0 = 6 for other  
- (A1, A1): 4 - 10 = -6 for me, 4 + 10 = 14 for other

## Step 4: Verify this creates the right incentives

With {A0: 0, A1: -10}:
- When other plays A0: I'm indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give 10)
- When other plays A1: I prefer A0 (2 > -6)
- When I play A0: Other prefers A0 (10 > 6)
- When I play A1: Other prefers A1 (14 > 10)

This makes (A0, A0) a Nash equilibrium with payoff (10, 10) - optimal for both!

The other player should approve because:
- Keeps their payoff at 10 for cooperation
- Punishes my defection (making cooperation stable)
- Better than the (4, 4) Nash outcome without contract

{"A0": 0, "A1": -10}

response:
Let's break this problem down step by step to design an optimal payment contract that maximizes *our* expected points, taking into account the game structure, the possibility of a contract, and the approval voting mechanism.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game Payoffs (as Player 1)

We are Player 1. The payoff matrix (Player 1’s payoff, Player 2’s payoff) is:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **P1: A1** | (6, 2)   | (4, 4)  |

This is a strategic interaction with conflicting incentives.

Let’s analyze the best responses:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 10 for A0, 6 for A1 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So P1 has no dominant strategy. The game is similar to a "coordination game with temptation" — it’s not fully symmetric.

Similarly for P2:

- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A1 (20 vs 10)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A1 (4 vs 2) → so P2 prefers A1 regardless.

Wait: P2 always gets more from A1:
- If P1 = A0 → P2: 20 (A1) vs 10 (A0) → prefers A1
- If P1 = A1 → P2: 4 (A1) vs 2 (A0) → prefers A1

**So P2 has a dominant strategy: A1**

Thus, rational P2 will always play A1. That means P1’s best response to A1 is A1 (4 > 0). So the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), with payoffs (4, 4).

But wait — what if we can change the incentives via a contract?

---

### Step 2: Goal of the Contract

We are to **design a contract** (a vector of extra payments: one for A0, one for A1) that, if accepted by both players, alters the effective payoffs. The contract is only active if *both* players accept it.

Additionally:
- The other player will also design a contract.
- Then, *both* contracts are submitted.
- A voting process occurs: every player (us and the other) votes for contracts they prefer.
- The winning contract is the one with the most approvals, and if multiple have equal max, it's chosen uniformly at random.

Our goal: **Maximize our expected final payoff**, assuming rational opponents.

So we must consider:
- What contract makes *us* better off?
- What contract is likely to be accepted (i.e., what makes *the other player* want to accept it)?
- What contract might win in approval voting?

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Implications of a Contract

Let’s suppose we propose a contract:  
{A0: x, A1: y}  
This means:
- If we play A0, we get x extra points (from P2).
- If we play A1, we get y extra points (from P2).
- So effectively, our total payoff becomes:  
  base payoff + [x if we play A0, y if we play A1]  
- But P2 pays us (x or y) → so P2’s total payoff is:  
  base payoff - [x if we play A0, y if we play A1]

So P2 pays us x or y, depending on what *we* do.

In game terms:
- We’re setting up an incentive mechanism: we reward ourselves for certain actions, and P2 funds it.

But P2 has *no choice* — they must decide *whether to accept the contract*.

So we must design a contract such that:
1. **We benefit** from it (expected payoff is higher than without contract).
2. **P2 is willing to accept it**, because otherwise it doesn’t go into effect.
3. **The contract is competitive** in the approval voting stage: possibly others (P2) vote for it, so it can win.

---

### Step 4: What does P2 want?

Recall: P2’s base payoff:
- Prefers A1 (dominant strategy), and wants to avoid giving us large payments.

P2 will only accept a contract if it makes *them* better off—or at least not worse off—compared to not having a contract at all, or perhaps comparing to what they might get with a different contract.

But note: **only one contract is active at a time**, and it’s the one with the most support.

So if P2 is rational, they will:
- Accept contracts that make their *expected payoff* higher.
- Vote for contracts that give them higher expected payoff.

We are designing a contract that P2 may or may not accept.

Let’s suppose we propose contract **C**: {A0: x, A1: y}

Then, if both accept it, the effective payoffs become:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (payoffs: 10+x, 10−x) | A1 (payoffs: 0+y, 20−y) |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| A0     | (10+x, 10−x)           | (y, 20−y)               |
| A1     | (6+x, 2−x)             | (4+y, 4−y)              |

We need to model what happens if the contract is active.

But P2 is still rational and will play A1 (dominant strategy), regardless of contract? Not necessarily — the contract changes P2’s effective payoffs.

Let’s analyze P2’s incentives under contract **C**:

P2’s effective payoffs when choosing A0 vs A1:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets: 10 − x (if P2 plays A0)
  - P2 gets: 20 − y (if P2 plays A1)
  → So P2 prefers A1 iff 20−y > 10−x → 10 + x > y

- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets: 2 − x (if P2 plays A0)
  - P2 gets: 4 − y (if P2 plays A1)
  → P2 prefers A1 iff 4−y > 2−x → 2 + x > y

So P2 will play A1 unless:
- 20−y ≤ 10−x → y ≥ 10 + x  (unlikely, since y is extra payment from P2)
- 4−y ≤ 2−x → y ≥ 2 + x

But for P2 to prefer A0, y must be large — which is bad for P2 (since they pay it).

Therefore, unless x is very negative (bad for us), P2 will still prefer A1.

But note: if we set x to be large positive, then P2 pays a lot when we play A0 → P2 is *very* disincentivized to let us play A0.

But since P2 prefers A1 anyway, and our actions depend on their play, let’s assume P2 plays A1 unless the contract makes it worse for them.

So unless the contract makes A1 worse for P2 than A0, they’ll still play A1.

But in most cases, P2 will play A1.

Then, **our best response to P2 playing A1**:
- If we play A0: get 0 + y (but P2 pays us y → wait, no: contract says: if we play A0, we get x more; if A1, we get y more)
Wait: correction.

Let’s clarify:

The contract says:
- If *I* play A0 → I get x extra points (taken from P2)
- If *I* play A1 → I get y extra points (taken from P2)

So if P2 plays A1, and we play A0 → we get 0 (base) + x → total: x
- P2 gets 20 (base) − x

If we play A1 → we get 4 + y
- P2 gets 4 − y

So our choices now:
- Play A0 → get x
- Play A1 → get 4 + y

Our best response: pick the higher of x and 4 + y

But P2 will only accept the contract if it's better for them than not playing (or compared to other contracts).

---

### Step 5: What contract maximizes our expected payoff?

We need to:
- Design contract such that:
   a. P2 is *willing* to accept it (i.e., it's not too costly for them, or slightly better, or they expect to benefit from it).
   b. We benefit from it.

But we are trying to get the contract **approved** — so we want *both* players to accept it.

So we need it to be **mutually beneficial**, or at least acceptable.

Let’s find a contract where:
- We get more expected payoff.
- P2 gets *at least as much* as they’d get without contract, or they believe they will get more (if it changes their incentives).

Recall: the equilibrium without contract is (A1, A1) → payoffs: (4,4)

So if we can design a contract such that:
- After contract, both players still play A1 (best response)
- Our payoff increases
- P2’s payoff is not worse than 4

Let’s suppose we set:
- A0: x
- A1: y

If P2 plays A1, and we play A1, we get 4 + y
P2 gets 4 − y

We want our payoff to be higher than 4 → so 4 + y > 4 → y > 0

But P2 gets 4 − y → so if y > 0, P2 gets less than 4 → worse off → they will not accept unless compensated.

But they can't be compensated by us — we’re the one getting the payment.

Alternatively, maybe we can induce P2 to play A0?

Suppose we make playing A0 very attractive to P2, and we are willing to pay them to do so.

Wait — but P2 has a dominant strategy: A1.

Unless we change the payoffs *so much* that P2 prefers A0.

For example, suppose we set:
- A0: x = 10  → we get 10 extra if we play A0
- A1: y = 0 → no extra if we play A1

But then P2’s payoffs:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2: 10 − x = 10 − 10 = 0 if they play A0
  - P2: 20 − y = 20 − 0 = 20 if they play A1 → still prefers A1

So P2 still plays A1.

Even if we get 10 extra for A0, but P2 is indifferent about the choice? No.

But if we play A1, we get 4 + 0 = 4

If we play A0, we get 0 + 10 = 10

So we want to play A0.

But P2 is playing A1 (since they prefer it), so outcome is (A0, A1) → we get 0 + 10 = 10 → we win!

P2 gets 20 − 10 = 10 → better than 4 → P2 gets 10 vs 4 → **so P2 actually benefits**.

Wait — that’s great!

But: if P2 plays A1, and we play A0, then we get 0 (base) + 10 (contract) = 10

P2 gets 20 (base) − 10 (contract payment) = 10

But is P2 **willing** to play A1? Yes, because if they played A0 instead, they’d get 10 − 10 = 0 (if we play A0), which is worse.

So P2 still prefers A1.

So under this contract: {A0: 10, A1: 0}, the outcome would be:
- We play A0 (since 10 > 4)
- P2 plays A1 (best response)
→ outcome: (A0, A1) → our payoff: 10
→ P2’s payoff: 10

Compared to original: (4,4)

So **both players get more**!

Our payoff: 10 vs 4 → +6
P2’s payoff: 10 vs 4 → +6

So it’s a **Pareto improvement**.

And if both players accept the contract, we both gain.

But wait — does P2 *want* to accept the contract?

- Without contract: (A1,A1) → (4,4)
- With contract: if both accept, we both get 10 → so P2 gets more → clearly willing to accept.

We also get more → so both of us accept.

But is there a problem?

Only if P2 believes someone else might propose a better contract.

But if we propose this one, and it makes both of us better off, P2 will accept it and vote for it (since it’s good for them).

So likely, this contract will win approval.

But wait — what if we propose something even better?

Suppose we try to make it so that we get even more.

Try: {A0: 20, A1: 0}

Then:
- If we play A0: get 0 + 20 = 20
- If we play A1: get 4 + 0 = 4 → so we play A0
- P2 plays A1 (still dominant)
- Outcome: (A0,A1) → we get 20, P2 gets 20 − 20 = 0

P2 gets 0 → worse than 4 → **so P2 will not accept this contract**.

So not acceptable.

So we must ensure that P2’s payoff is *at least* as good as 4.

In the previous case, when x=10, y=0:
- P2 gets 10 → better than 4 → acceptable.

Can we do better?

Try: {A0: x, A1: y}, and suppose outcome is (A0,A1) → our payoff = 0 + x, P2 payoff = 20 − x

We want:
- We play A0: so 0+x > 4+y → x > 4+y
- P2 plays A1: so 20−x > 10−x → 20 > 10 → always true
  - Actually, P2’s choice depends on what P1 does.
  - When P1 plays A0: P2 compares 10−x (for A0) vs 20−x (for A1) → 20−x > 10−x → always true → P2 prefers A1
  - So yes, P2 plays A1.

So as long as we play A0, P2 plays A1 → outcome is (A0,A1) → we get x, P2 gets 20−x

We want:
- x > 4+y → so we prefer A0 over A1
- 20−x ≥ 4 → so P2 is at least as good as without contract
  → x ≤ 16

Also, to make the contract acceptable to P2, we need 20−x ≥ 4 → x ≤ 16 → so x ≤ 16

And we want to maximize x (since we get x), so best is x=16

Then x=16, and x > 4+y → 16 > 4+y → y < 12

So y can be up to 11

But y is bonus to us when we play A1, but we’re playing A0 → so y is irrelevant unless we play A1.

But to be safe, set y as small as possible — ideally zero or negative.

But if y is negative, we *pay* P2 when we play A1 → that’s bad for us.

But since we’re playing A0 anyway, we never actually pay.

So we can set y = 0.

Then:
- Contract: {A0: 16, A1: 0}
- We play A0 (since 16 > 4+0 = 4)
- P2 plays A1 (always)
- Outcome: (A0,A1)
- We get: 0 + 16 = 16
- P2 gets: 20 − 16 = 4 → same as base

P2 is indifferent — they get 4 either way.

But are they willing to accept?

- Without contract: (A1,A1) → 4
- With contract: (A0,A1) → P2 still gets 4 → so no loss
- But they get nothing more than baseline → they might still accept.

But in approval voting, they might consider other contracts.

Suppose the other player proposes a contract that benefits them.

But if we propose this contract, and P2 gets 4 (same as before), they might accept only if no better contract.

But we can do better: **make P2 strictly better off**.

So go back.

We want:
- P2 gets > 4 → 20−x > 4 → x < 16

So x ≤ 15

Then P2 gets 5 or more.

And we want x maximized → so x=15

Then:
- x=15, y=0
- We get: 0+15=15
- P2 gets: 20−15=5 > 4 → better off

Also: we prefer A0 → 15 > 4+0 = 4 → yes

P2 still plays A1 → so outcome (A0,A1)

Both benefit.

P2 gets 5 > 4 → they will accept and vote for it.

We get 15 → much better than 4.

Perfect.

Can we do better?

Try x=15, y=1

Then we get 15 for A0, 4+1=5 for A1 → we still prefer A0.

P2 gets 20−15=5 → same as before.

But y=1 → when we play A1, we get +1 from P2 → but we don’t play A1, so no cost.

But this does nothing — just adds a tiny cost to us (not playing A1), but we don’t use it.

So y can be 0.

But what if we set y negative?

Say y=-5 → we pay P2 5 if we play A1.

But we never play A1, so it’s fine.

But P2 might object: “Why should I accept a contract that makes me get the same or less, and also has a cost if I play A0?”

Wait — no, the contract only affects P2 based on *our action*.

The payment flow is:
- P2 pays us x if we play A0
- P2 pays us y if we play A1

So if y = -5, then if we play A1, *we pay P2 5*.

But we don’t play A1.

So P2 is unaffected.

But P2 might still question: what if we change? But they are rational.

But the contract is only active if agreed.

So setting y negative is harmless to P2 if we are not playing A1.

But it might make P2 less inclined to accept — they don’t get anything extra, but if we play A1 (which they don’t expect), we pay them.

But why would P2 care?

But to make it simpler and safer, better to set y=0, so no risk.

Now, wait — can we set x=15, y=0.

But what if we set y=10?

Then we get 15 for A0, 4+10=14 for A1 → still prefer A0.

P2 gets 20−15=5 → still good.

But we don’t use the y bonus → so no harm.

But it doesn’t help us.

So best to set y=0.

But is there a way to get more than 15?

Only if x>15 → but then P2 gets 20−x <5 → if x=16, P2 gets 4 → equal → they might accept, but not better.

But if x=17, P2 gets 3 <4 → worse → they won’t accept.

So maximum x=15 → P2 gets 5 → strictly better.

So contract: {A0: 15, A1: 0}

Then:
- Both players accept (P2 gets 5 >4, we get 15>4)
- Outcome: (A0, A1) → payoffs: (15, 5) → both better than (4,4)

Perfect.

But — wait — is it possible that P2 thinks: “Wait, if I accept this, I get 5, but maybe I could get more with another contract?”

But we are designing the contract — and P2 will see the outcome.

But if they vote, and they prefer this one (because it gives them 5 vs 4), they will vote for it.

And if we propose this, and no other contract gives them more, it will win — or at least tie.

But to increase chances, we can make it even better?

Suppose we make x=14, y=1

Then:
- We get: 0+14=14 for A0
- Play A1: 4+1=5 → prefer A0 → yes
- P2 gets 20−14=6 >5 → even better
- But we get only 14 <15 → worse for us.

So not better.

Can we make both get more?

No — because the total "pool" is fixed: the sum of payoffs in (A0,A1) base is 0 + 20 = 20

With contract, we add x to us, subtract x from P2 → total remains 20

So sum = (0 + x) + (20 − x) = 20

We get 15, P2 gets 5 → total 20

If we get 16, P2 gets 4 → sum 20

So maximum we can get is 16 (P2 gets 4), or 15 (P2 gets 5)

We prefer 15 for P2, to keep them accepting.

But what if P2 prefers a contract where they get more than 5?

But if we give them more, we get less.

Unless we can induce a different outcome.

Suppose we try to get (A0, A0) outcome.

Then:
- Base: (10,10)
- Contract: if we play A0 → we get x
- If we play A0 → P2 pays us x

So we get 10 + x
P2 gets 10 − x

We want to play A0 → so 10+x > 6+y

P2 wants to play A0 → so 10−x > 2−x → 10 > 2 → always true

Wait: P2's payoff depends on our action.

If we play A0:
- P2 gets 10 − x (if they play A0)
- P2 gets 20 − y (if they play A1)

So P2 prefers A0 only if 10−x > 20−y → y − x > 10

So to make P2 play A0, we need y − x > 10 → e.g., y = 20, x = 0 → y−x=20>10

Then:
- We play A0: get 10+0=10
- P2 plays A0: get 10−0=10 → if y=20, but we don’t play A1, so no problem
But if y=20, and we play A1, we get 4+20=24 → so we’d prefer A1 → so we wouldn’t play A0

But we only play A0 if 10+x > 4+y

So 10+0 > 4+20 → 10 > 24 → false → we prefer A1

So can’t induce A0.

Suppose we set x=15, y=0 → we prefer A0 (15 > 4), but P2 prefers A1 (20 > 10)

So no way to force P2 to play A0.

So the only achievable outcome under contract that benefits both is (A0, A1), with P2 playing A1.

And under that, we can extract up to x=15, y=0, so we get 15, P2 gets 5.

Any higher x → P2 worse off → won’t accept.

So x=15, y=0 is optimal.

But let’s check one thing: what if P2 says: “Wait, if I accept this contract, I get 5, but I could play A1 and get 4 anyway — so I’m better off.”

Yes — so they will accept.

And they’ll vote for it.

We also accept.

So both accept.

Now, suppose the other player also proposes a contract.

The other player might propose, say:
- {A0: 0, A1: 20} → if they play A1, they get 20 extra → but we pay them

But we are not playing A1 → so no cost.

But if they play A1, we get base 4 + 0 = 4 (if our contract has x=15), but wait — only one contract active.

So if they propose a contract, and we propose one, only one will be active.

But in the voting, they vote for contracts that make them better off.

Suppose they propose {A0: 0, A1: 10}

Then if accepted, and we play A1 → we get 4+10=14
They get 4−10=−6 → bad

But if we play A0 → we get 0+0=0; they get 20−0=20

But they may not want us to play A0.

But they are rational.

Under their contract, if we play A0 → they get 20 (base) minus 0 = 20
We get 0 + 0 = 0

But we might not want to play A0.

If we play A1 → we get 4+10=14
They get 4−10=−6 → very bad.

So we play A1 → outcome (A1,A1) → they get −6 → worse than 4 → so they won’t accept their own contract.

So no.

Alternatively, they might propose a contract that makes them better off, e.g., {A0: 0, A1: 10}, but they won’t accept it because they get −6.

So likely, only contracts that benefit both or at least P2 will be acceptable.

Our contract {A0:15, A1:0} gives both of us better payoffs: (15,5) vs (4,4)

So P2 will accept and vote for it.

We also accept.

So it has 2 votes → wins.

Other contracts may have only one vote or none.

So it wins.

Thus, this is a robust choice.

Can we set y to something negative?

Say y = -5

Then contract: {A0:15, A1:-5}

- We play A0: get 15
- If we played A1: get 4 -5 = -1 → so still prefer A0
- P2 gets 20 - 15 = 5 → still good

But we are getting same, P2 same.

But by setting y negative, we are *making* it harder for them — because if we ever played A1, we would pay them — but we won’t.

So no benefit.

And it might make them question: “Why do I get to accept a contract that could cost me if you play A1?”

So better to set y=0.

Hence, best contract: {A0:15, A1:0}

---

### Final Decision

We propose:
- A0: +15 → we gain 15 if we play A0, paid by P2
- A1: 0 → no extra payment

This induces:
- We play A0 (since 15 > 4)
- P2 plays A1 (best response)
- Outcome: (A0, A1)
- We get 0 + 15 = 15
- P2 gets 20 - 15 = 5

Both better than (4,4) → so both accept and vote for it → it wins.

Thus, this maximizes our expected payoff.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

response:
Let's analyze the game step by step to design an optimal contract that maximizes **your** total expected points, taking into account both the original payoff structure and the possibility of a contract that influences the other player's behavior.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game (Player 2's Perspective)

You are **Player 2**. The other player is **Player 1**.

Your payoff matrix (Player 2’s points):

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| A0      | 10       | 2        |
| A1      | 20       | 4        |

So:
- If you play A0, you get:
  - 10 if P1 plays A0
  - 2 if P1 plays A1
- If you play A1, you get:
  - 20 if P1 plays A0
  - 4 if P1 plays A1

So your best response depends on what P1 does.

But you don’t know what P1 will do. So we need to think strategically.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Pure and Mixed Strategy Equilibrium (Without Contract)

Let’s first find the Nash equilibrium to understand baseline play.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability P1 plays A0
- $ q $ = probability you (P2) play A0

Your expected payoff from playing A0:  
$ U_2(A0) = 10p + 2(1 - p) = 8p + 2 $

Your expected payoff from playing A1:  
$ U_2(A1) = 20p + 4(1 - p) = 16p + 4 $

Set $ U_2(A0) = U_2(A1) $:  
$ 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 $  
$ -8p = 2 $ → $ p = -0.25 $ → impossible.

Wait — this suggests **you never want to play A0** if P1 plays any $ p \in [0,1] $, because $ 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 $ for all $ p $.

Check:
- At $ p = 0 $: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4 → A1 better
- At $ p = 1 $: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 20 → A1 better

So A1 **dominates A0** for Player 2?

Wait — actually, look at when you play A0:
- If P1 plays A0 → you get 10
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 2

But if you play A1:
- If P1 plays A0 → you get 20
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 4

So you **always benefit** from A1 if P1 plays A0 (20 > 10), and **lose less** if P1 plays A1 (4 > 2). So yes, A1 **strictly dominates A0** for Player 2.

Thus, **in equilibrium, you will always play A1**.

Now consider P1’s payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| A0      | 10       | 0        |
| A1      | 6        | 4        |

So P1’s payoff:
- A0: 10q + 6(1 - q) = 4q + 6
- A1: 0q + 4(1 - q) = 4 - 4q

Set equal: $ 4q + 6 = 4 - 4q $ → $ 8q = -2 $ → $ q = -0.25 $

Again, impossible — so P1’s best response is to play A0 when the threshold is not reached.

Check:
- At q = 0 (you always play A1): P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → so P1 prefers A1
- At q = 1 (you always play A0): P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefers A0

So P1’s best response:
- If q > 0.5 → A1 is better (since 4 - 4q < 4q + 6 only when q > 0.25)
Wait: Let's solve exactly.

Set $ 4q + 6 = 4 - 4q $ → $ 8q = -2 $ → q = -0.25 → never equal.

But 4q + 6 is increasing, 4 - 4q decreasing.

At q = 0: P1-A0 = 6, P1-A1 = 4 → prefers A0
At q = 1: P1-A0 = 10, P1-A1 = 0 → prefers A0

Wait — that can’t be. If q = 1 (you always play A0), then P1:
- A0: gets 10
- A1: gets 6 → so prefers A0

But if q = 0 (you always play A1), then P1:
- A0: gets 0
- A1: gets 4 → prefers A1

So P1’s best response:
- If q < 0.5? Wait — logic:

Let’s define P1’s payoff from A0: $ 10q + 6(1 - q) = 4q + 6 $

A1: $ 0q + 4(1 - q) = 4 - 4q $

Set equal: $ 4q + 6 = 4 - 4q $ → $ 8q = -2 $ → $ q = -0.25 $ → so inequality holds for *all* q:

$ 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q $ → $ 8q > -2 $ → always true

So $ 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q $ for all q ∈ [0,1] → **P1 always prefers A0**?

Wait, at q = 0:
- A0: 0 (P1 gets 0)
- A1: 4 (P1 gets 4) → so A1 is better!

Contradiction.

Wait — I messed up the payoff matrix.

Go back: Original payoffs.

When:
- P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 10, P2 gets 10
- P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 6, P2 gets 2
- P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0, P2 gets 20
- P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4

So correct P1 payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| A0      | 10       | 0        |
| A1      | 6        | 4        |

So P1’s choice:
- A0: 10q + 6(1 - q) = 4q + 6
- A1: 0q + 4(1 - q) = 4 - 4q

Now, compare:
- When is $ 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q $?
- $ 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q $ → $ 8q > -2 $ → always true?

Wait no: for small q, 4 - 4q is large.

Let’s test:
- q = 0: A0: 4(0) + 6 = 6, A1: 4 - 0 = 4 → A0 better
- q = 1: A0: 4 + 6 = 10, A1: 4 - 4 = 0 → A0 better
- q = 0.5: A0: 4(0.5) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8, A1: 4 - 2 = 2 → A0 better

But at q = 0, is A1 better? No: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 6 → A0 better

Wait — this suggests P1 **always prefers A0**, regardless of your mix?

But when q = 0 (you play A1 always), P1:
- A0 → gets 0
- A1 → gets 4 → so A1 is better

Ah! I made a mistake in the calculation.

When you play A1 always (q = 0), then:
- If P1 plays A0 → outcome: P1-A0, P2-A1 → P1 gets 0
- If P1 plays A1 → outcome: P1-A1, P2-A1 → P1 gets 4

So yes, P1 prefers A1 when q = 0 (you play A1)

But in P1’s expected payoff:

- If P1 plays A0: gets 10 * q + 6 * (1 - q) = 10q + 6 - 6q = 4q + 6
- If P1 plays A1: gets 0 * q + 4 * (1 - q) = 4(1 - q) = 4 - 4q

Set equal:
$ 4q + 6 = 4 - 4q $
→ $ 8q = -2 $ → $ q = -0.25 $

Since q ≥ 0, and the left (A0) is strictly greater than the right when q = 0 (6 > 4), but at q = 0: A0 payoff = 6, A1 = 4 → A0 better
But wait — at q = 0, if P1 plays A1, he gets 4
If he plays A0, he gets 0 → because you're playing A1 → so P1 gets 0 for A0

Ah! Here’s the mistake: **The value depends on who plays what**.

The payoff for P1:
- When P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10
- When P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0
- When P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0: P1 gets 6
- When P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A1: P1 gets 4

So P1’s expected payoff when he plays A0:  
$ \text{P2 plays A0 with prob } q $ → payoff: $ 10q + 0(1 - q) = 10q $

When he plays A1: payoff $ 6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

So P1’s best response:
- Play A0 if $ 10q > 2q + 4 $ → $ 8q > 4 $ → $ q > 0.5 $
- Play A1 if $ 2q + 4 > 10q $ → $ 4 > 8q $ → $ q < 0.5 $
- Indifferent at q = 0.5

So P1:
- Plays A0 if q > 0.5
- Plays A1 if q < 0.5

Now you are Player 2, and you want to maximize your expected payoff.

Your payoff:
- If you play A0: $ 10p + 2(1 - p) = 8p + 2 $ → where p = P(P1 plays A0)
- If you play A1: $ 20p + 4(1 - p) = 16p + 4 $

But p depends on q: p = P(P1 plays A0)

We now solve for Nash equilibrium.

Suppose you play A1 with probability q.

Then P1 plays A0 if q > 0.5, A1 if q < 0.5.

So:
- If q > 0.5 → p = 1
- If q < 0.5 → p = 0
- If q = 0.5 → p can be anything

Now, your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 8p + 2 → if p =1: 10, if p=0: 2
- If you play A1: 16p + 4 → if p=1: 20, if p=0: 4

So:
- If q > 0.5 → p=1 → you prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If q < 0.5 → p=0 → you prefer A1 (4 > 2)
- If q = 0.5 → p is indeterminate

So you always want to play A1.

Similarly, suppose you play A1 (q=1) → then P1 plays A0 (since q=1 > 0.5) → p=1

Then your payoff from A1 is 20 → good.

P1 would prefer to deviate to A1? If P1 plays A1 → gets 4 (since you play A1), but if he plays A0 → gets 0 → so he won’t deviate → A0 is better

But if he plays A1, he gets 4, while A0 gives 0 → so he wouldn't deviate.

So (q=1, p=1) is candidate?

But P1 has q=1, so he plays A0.

But if he plays A1, he gets 4, while A0 gives him 0 → so he prefers A1!

Contradiction.

Ah! Yes: at q=1 (you always play A1), P1:
- A0: gets 0
- A1: gets 4 → so prefers A1

So P1 will not play A0 → he plays A1 → p=0

Then your payoff:
- A0: 8*0 + 2 = 2
- A1: 16*0 + 4 = 4 → so A1 better

So you play A1 → q=1

P1 sees: you play A1 → so he plays A1 → since A1 gives 4 > 0

So if both play A1 → p=0, q=1 → you get 4, P1 gets 4 → stable.

Check if P1 wants to deviate: if P1 plays A0 (and you play A1), he gets 0 < 4 → no

You: if you play A0 (P1 plays A1), you get 2 < 4 → no

So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

What about other equilibria?

Is (A0, A0) possible? You play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 10, P1 gets 10

But if you deviate to A1 → you get 20 > 10 → so you want to deviate → not NE.

What about mixed strategy?

Suppose P1 plays A0 with probability p

You play A1 only if 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → 8p + 2 > 0 → always true? 16p+4 - (8p+2) = 8p +2 >0 → yes for all p≥0 → so A1 strictly dominates A0 for you → so you *always* play A1 in any equilibrium

So q = 1

Then P1 plays A0 only if 10q > 2q + 4 → 10 > 2 + 4 = 6 → but q=1 → 10 > 6 → yes → so P1 plays A0

But earlier we saw: when you play A1 (q=1), P1 gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → so prefers A1 → contradiction

Ah! Here is the key:

When q = 1 → P1’s payoff:
- A0: 10*1 + 0*0 = 10? No!

Wait — when P1 plays A0, and you(2) play A1 → P1 gets 0 (from the rule: you A1, other A0 → P1 gets 0)

When P1 plays A1, you play A1 → P1 gets 4

So P1 gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So P1 will play A1 when q=1 → so p=0

So your payoff from A1: 20*0 + 4*1 = 4

Now, is there any other equilibrium?

Suppose q < 0.5 → P1 plays A1 → p=0

Then you: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 → you play A1

So q=1 → contradiction with q<0.5

If q > 0.5 → P1 plays A0 → p=1

Then you: A1 gives 20, A0 gives 10 → you play A1 → q=1 → so q>0.5 satisfied

But P1: when q=1, he gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → so he won't play A0 → contradiction

Thus, only consistent solution is when q=1, p=0 → both play A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4, P1 gets 4

No other equilibrium.

Is (A1, A1) the only NE? Yes.

So **in equilibrium, both players play A1**, and you get 4 points.

---

### Step 3: Introduce the Contract

Your goal: **maximize your expected points**, including contract terms.

You design a contract: for each action (A0, A1), you specify a **net transfer**:
- Positive: you get X from the other player
- Negative: you pay X to the other player
- Zero: no transfer

Contract applies **only if both players accept**.

The contract will be active only if **both** accept.

But you propose a contract, and the other player proposes one. Then **approval voting** — **you and the other player** each vote. The contract with **most approvals** wins, and if tie, random choice.

So you need to:
- Design a contract that:
  1. You will **want to accept

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Your previous response was:
Let's analyze the game step by step to design an optimal contract that maximizes **your** total expected points, taking into account both the original payoff structure and the possibility of a contract that influences the other player's behavior.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game (Player 2's Perspective)

You are **Player 2**. The other player is **Player 1**.

Your payoff matrix (Player 2’s points):

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| A0      | 10       | 2        |
| A1      | 20       | 4        |

So:
- If you play A0, you get:
  - 10 if P1 plays A0
  - 2 if P1 plays A1
- If you play A1, you get:
  - 20 if P1 plays A0
  - 4 if P1 plays A1

So your best response depends on what P1 does.

But you don’t know what P1 will do. So we need to think strategically.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Pure and Mixed Strategy Equilibrium (Without Contract)

Let’s first find the Nash equilibrium to understand baseline play.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability P1 plays A0
- $ q $ = probability you (P2) play A0

Your expected payoff from playing A0:  
$ U_2(A0) = 10p + 2(1 - p) = 8p + 2 $

Your expected payoff from playing A1:  
$ U_2(A1) = 20p + 4(1 - p) = 16p + 4 $

Set $ U_2(A0) = U_2(A1) $:  
$ 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 $  
$ -8p = 2 $ → $ p = -0.25 $ → impossible.

Wait — this suggests **you never want to play A0** if P1 plays any $ p \in [0,1] $, because $ 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 $ for all $ p $.

Check:
- At $ p = 0 $: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4 → A1 better
- At $ p = 1 $: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 20 → A1 better

So A1 **dominates A0** for Player 2?

Wait — actually, look at when you play A0:
- If P1 plays A0 → you get 10
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 2

But if you play A1:
- If P1 plays A0 → you get 20
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 4

So you **always benefit** from A1 if P1 plays A0 (20 > 10), and **lose less** if P1 plays A1 (4 > 2). So yes, A1 **strictly dominates A0** for Player 2.

Thus, **in equilibrium, you will always play A1**.

Now consider P1’s payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| A0      | 10       | 0        |
| A1      | 6        | 4        |

So P1’s payoff:
- A0: 10q + 6(1 - q) = 4q + 6
- A1: 0q + 4(1 - q) = 4 - 4q

Set equal: $ 4q + 6 = 4 - 4q $ → $ 8q = -2 $ → $ q = -0.25 $

Again, impossible — so P1’s best response is to play A0 when the threshold is not reached.

Check:
- At q = 0 (you always play A1): P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → so P1 prefers A1
- At q = 1 (you always play A0): P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefers A0

So P1’s best response:
- If q > 0.5 → A1 is better (since 4 - 4q < 4q + 6 only when q > 0.25)
Wait: Let's solve exactly.

Set $ 4q + 6 = 4 - 4q $ → $ 8q = -2 $ → q = -0.25 → never equal.

But 4q + 6 is increasing, 4 - 4q decreasing.

At q = 0: P1-A0 = 6, P1-A1 = 4 → prefers A0
At q = 1: P1-A0 = 10, P1-A1 = 0 → prefers A0

Wait — that can’t be. If q = 1 (you always play A0), then P1:
- A0: gets 10
- A1: gets 6 → so prefers A0

But if q = 0 (you always play A1), then P1:
- A0: gets 0
- A1: gets 4 → prefers A1

So P1’s best response:
- If q < 0.5? Wait — logic:

Let’s define P1’s payoff from A0: $ 10q + 6(1 - q) = 4q + 6 $

A1: $ 0q + 4(1 - q) = 4 - 4q $

Set equal: $ 4q + 6 = 4 - 4q $ → $ 8q = -2 $ → $ q = -0.25 $ → so inequality holds for *all* q:

$ 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q $ → $ 8q > -2 $ → always true

So $ 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q $ for all q ∈ [0,1] → **P1 always prefers A0**?

Wait, at q = 0:
- A0: 0 (P1 gets 0)
- A1: 4 (P1 gets 4) → so A1 is better!

Contradiction.

Wait — I messed up the payoff matrix.

Go back: Original payoffs.

When:
- P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 10, P2 gets 10
- P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 6, P2 gets 2
- P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0, P2 gets 20
- P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4

So correct P1 payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| A0      | 10       | 0        |
| A1      | 6        | 4        |

So P1’s choice:
- A0: 10q + 6(1 - q) = 4q + 6
- A1: 0q + 4(1 - q) = 4 - 4q

Now, compare:
- When is $ 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q $?
- $ 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q $ → $ 8q > -2 $ → always true?

Wait no: for small q, 4 - 4q is large.

Let’s test:
- q = 0: A0: 4(0) + 6 = 6, A1: 4 - 0 = 4 → A0 better
- q = 1: A0: 4 + 6 = 10, A1: 4 - 4 = 0 → A0 better
- q = 0.5: A0: 4(0.5) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8, A1: 4 - 2 = 2 → A0 better

But at q = 0, is A1 better? No: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 6 → A0 better

Wait — this suggests P1 **always prefers A0**, regardless of your mix?

But when q = 0 (you play A1 always), P1:
- A0 → gets 0
- A1 → gets 4 → so A1 is better

Ah! I made a mistake in the calculation.

When you play A1 always (q = 0), then:
- If P1 plays A0 → outcome: P1-A0, P2-A1 → P1 gets 0
- If P1 plays A1 → outcome: P1-A1, P2-A1 → P1 gets 4

So yes, P1 prefers A1 when q = 0 (you play A1)

But in P1’s expected payoff:

- If P1 plays A0: gets 10 * q + 6 * (1 - q) = 10q + 6 - 6q = 4q + 6
- If P1 plays A1: gets 0 * q + 4 * (1 - q) = 4(1 - q) = 4 - 4q

Set equal:
$ 4q + 6 = 4 - 4q $
→ $ 8q = -2 $ → $ q = -0.25 $

Since q ≥ 0, and the left (A0) is strictly greater than the right when q = 0 (6 > 4), but at q = 0: A0 payoff = 6, A1 = 4 → A0 better
But wait — at q = 0, if P1 plays A1, he gets 4
If he plays A0, he gets 0 → because you're playing A1 → so P1 gets 0 for A0

Ah! Here’s the mistake: **The value depends on who plays what**.

The payoff for P1:
- When P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10
- When P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0
- When P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0: P1 gets 6
- When P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A1: P1 gets 4

So P1’s expected payoff when he plays A0:  
$ \text{P2 plays A0 with prob } q $ → payoff: $ 10q + 0(1 - q) = 10q $

When he plays A1: payoff $ 6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

So P1’s best response:
- Play A0 if $ 10q > 2q + 4 $ → $ 8q > 4 $ → $ q > 0.5 $
- Play A1 if $ 2q + 4 > 10q $ → $ 4 > 8q $ → $ q < 0.5 $
- Indifferent at q = 0.5

So P1:
- Plays A0 if q > 0.5
- Plays A1 if q < 0.5

Now you are Player 2, and you want to maximize your expected payoff.

Your payoff:
- If you play A0: $ 10p + 2(1 - p) = 8p + 2 $ → where p = P(P1 plays A0)
- If you play A1: $ 20p + 4(1 - p) = 16p + 4 $

But p depends on q: p = P(P1 plays A0)

We now solve for Nash equilibrium.

Suppose you play A1 with probability q.

Then P1 plays A0 if q > 0.5, A1 if q < 0.5.

So:
- If q > 0.5 → p = 1
- If q < 0.5 → p = 0
- If q = 0.5 → p can be anything

Now, your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 8p + 2 → if p =1: 10, if p=0: 2
- If you play A1: 16p + 4 → if p=1: 20, if p=0: 4

So:
- If q > 0.5 → p=1 → you prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If q < 0.5 → p=0 → you prefer A1 (4 > 2)
- If q = 0.5 → p is indeterminate

So you always want to play A1.

Similarly, suppose you play A1 (q=1) → then P1 plays A0 (since q=1 > 0.5) → p=1

Then your payoff from A1 is 20 → good.

P1 would prefer to deviate to A1? If P1 plays A1 → gets 4 (since you play A1), but if he plays A0 → gets 0 → so he won’t deviate → A0 is better

But if he plays A1, he gets 4, while A0 gives 0 → so he wouldn't deviate.

So (q=1, p=1) is candidate?

But P1 has q=1, so he plays A0.

But if he plays A1, he gets 4, while A0 gives him 0 → so he prefers A1!

Contradiction.

Ah! Yes: at q=1 (you always play A1), P1:
- A0: gets 0
- A1: gets 4 → so prefers A1

So P1 will not play A0 → he plays A1 → p=0

Then your payoff:
- A0: 8*0 + 2 = 2
- A1: 16*0 + 4 = 4 → so A1 better

So you play A1 → q=1

P1 sees: you play A1 → so he plays A1 → since A1 gives 4 > 0

So if both play A1 → p=0, q=1 → you get 4, P1 gets 4 → stable.

Check if P1 wants to deviate: if P1 plays A0 (and you play A1), he gets 0 < 4 → no

You: if you play A0 (P1 plays A1), you get 2 < 4 → no

So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

What about other equilibria?

Is (A0, A0) possible? You play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 10, P1 gets 10

But if you deviate to A1 → you get 20 > 10 → so you want to deviate → not NE.

What about mixed strategy?

Suppose P1 plays A0 with probability p

You play A1 only if 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → 8p + 2 > 0 → always true? 16p+4 - (8p+2) = 8p +2 >0 → yes for all p≥0 → so A1 strictly dominates A0 for you → so you *always* play A1 in any equilibrium

So q = 1

Then P1 plays A0 only if 10q > 2q + 4 → 10 > 2 + 4 = 6 → but q=1 → 10 > 6 → yes → so P1 plays A0

But earlier we saw: when you play A1 (q=1), P1 gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → so prefers A1 → contradiction

Ah! Here is the key:

When q = 1 → P1’s payoff:
- A0: 10*1 + 0*0 = 10? No!

Wait — when P1 plays A0, and you(2) play A1 → P1 gets 0 (from the rule: you A1, other A0 → P1 gets 0)

When P1 plays A1, you play A1 → P1 gets 4

So P1 gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So P1 will play A1 when q=1 → so p=0

So your payoff from A1: 20*0 + 4*1 = 4

Now, is there any other equilibrium?

Suppose q < 0.5 → P1 plays A1 → p=0

Then you: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 → you play A1

So q=1 → contradiction with q<0.5

If q > 0.5 → P1 plays A0 → p=1

Then you: A1 gives 20, A0 gives 10 → you play A1 → q=1 → so q>0.5 satisfied

But P1: when q=1, he gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → so he won't play A0 → contradiction

Thus, only consistent solution is when q=1, p=0 → both play A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4, P1 gets 4

No other equilibrium.

Is (A1, A1) the only NE? Yes.

So **in equilibrium, both players play A1**, and you get 4 points.

---

### Step 3: Introduce the Contract

Your goal: **maximize your expected points**, including contract terms.

You design a contract: for each action (A0, A1), you specify a **net transfer**:
- Positive: you get X from the other player
- Negative: you pay X to the other player
- Zero: no transfer

Contract applies **only if both players accept**.

The contract will be active only if **both** accept.

But you propose a contract, and the other player proposes one. Then **approval voting** — **you and the other player** each vote. The contract with **most approvals** wins, and if tie, random choice.

So you need to:

  1. You will **want to accept

response:
To decide which contracts to approve, we need to carefully analyze the effects of each contract on potential payoffs and how they may influence both players' strategies. We'll break it down step by step:

### Basic Game Analysis Without Contract
First, let's summarize the payoffs without any contract:
- **(A0, A0)**: You get 10, the other player gets 10.
- **(A1, A0)**: You get 20, the other player gets 0.
- **(A0, A1)**: You get 2, the other player gets 6.
- **(A1, A1)**: You get 4, the other player gets 4.

### Proposals Analysis
Now, we will analyze the suggested contracts:

#### Contract proposed by Player 1:
- **If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points drawn equally from the other players.**
  
  **Payments**:
  - (A0, A0): You get 10 + 11/2 = 15.5 and the other player gets 10 + 11/2 = 15.5.
  - (A1, A0): You get 20 - 11/2 = 14.5, the other player gets 0 + 11/2 = 5.5.
  - (A0, A1): You get 2 + 11/2 = 7.5, the other player gets 6 - 11/2 = 0.5.
  - (A1, A1): You get 4, the other player gets 4.

Analyzing how this affects the decisions:
- Choosing A0 increases your payoff significantly in most scenarios.
- For player 1, choosing A0 seems favorable compared to A1, as even getting 5.5 points is better (for player 1) than the latter scenarios.

#### Contract proposed by Player 2:
- **If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points drawn equally from the other players.**
  
  **Payments**:
  - (A0, A0): You get 10 + 5/2 = 12.5 and the other player gets 10 + 5/2 = 12.5.
  - (A1, A0): You get 20 - 5/2 = 17.5, the other player gets 0 + 5/2 = 2.5.
  - (A0, A1): You get 2 + 5/2 = 4.5, the other player gets 6 - 5/2 = 3.5.
  - (A1, A1): You get 4, the other player gets 4.

Analyzing how this affects decisions:
- Choosing A0 with the reduced incentive might be less compelling but still preferable in some scenarios. 
- The increased payment is smaller, thus less disruptive than Player 1's proposal.

### Approvals
Compare the incentives:
- Player 1’s contract strongly shifts balance towards choosing A0.
- Player 2’s contract is less drastic but still influences towards A0, though subtly.

Given these analyses, from an approval perspective:
1. Player 1’s contract is extreme and disrupts fairness significantly.
2. Player 2’s contract is less drastic and offers better-balanced incentives.

Therefore:
- **We do not approve Contract C1** because it disrupts the natural balance excessively.
- **We approve Contract C2** because it provides balanced incentives without making the game significantly unfair.

### Final JSON Output
```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}
```

response:
To maximize the points received, we first analyze the game's base payoffs and then evaluate the impact of the proposed contracts.

### 1. Base Game Analysis
Without a contract, the payoff matrix is as follows:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this scenario, Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1 will also choose A1 (4 > 0). The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in only **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Evaluation of Contract 1 (C1)
C1 offers an additional payment of 11 points for choosing A0, taken from the other player.
Adjusted payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10 + 11 - 11, 10 + 11 - 11) = **(10, 10)**
- (A0, A1): (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = **(11, 9)**
- (A1, A0): (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = **(-5, 13)**
- (A1, A1): **(4, 4)**

Nash Equilibrium for C1:
- For Player 1: A0 is dominant (10 > -5 and 11 > 4).
- For Player 2: A0 is dominant (10 > 9 and 13 > 4).
The result is (A0, A0), giving Player 1 **10 points**.

### 3. Evaluation of Contract 2 (C2)
C2 offers an additional payment of 12 points for choosing A0, taken from the other player.
Adjusted payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10 + 12 - 12, 10 + 12 - 12) = **(10, 10)**
- (A0, A1): (0 + 12, 20 - 12) = **(12, 8)**
- (A1, A0): (6 - 12, 2 + 12) = **(-6, 14)**
- (A1, A1): **(4, 4)**

Nash Equilibrium for C2:
- For Player 1: A0 is dominant (10 > -6 and 12 > 4).
- For Player 2: A0 is dominant (10 > 8 and 14 > 4).
The result is (A0, A0), giving Player 1 **10 points**.

### 4. Comparison and Decision
Both contracts successfully shift the Nash Equilibrium from the low-yielding (A1, A1) to the high-yielding (A0, A0). 
- **C1** and **C2** both result in 10 points for Player 1 in the equilibrium.
- **C2** provides a slightly stronger incentive for Player 2 to stay at A0 (a 2-point loss for deviating to A1, compared to a 1-point loss in C1). 
- **C2** also rewards Player 1 more (12 vs 11) if Player 2 were to unpredictably play A1.

Since both contracts significantly improve Player 1's outcome from 4 points to 10 points, the most robust strategy is to approve both to ensure at least one is implemented.

response:
Under the original game rules, the unique Nash Equilibrium occurs at (A1, A1), where Player 1 and Player 2 both receive 4 points. To maximize points, we must evaluate how the proposed contracts shift this equilibrium and affect the final expected payoff.

1.  **Contract C1 Analysis:**
    *   C1 proposes that any player choosing A0 receives 11 points from the other player.
    *   New Payoff Matrix for C1:
        *   (A0, A0): 10 points for both (11 gained and 11 lost by each).
        *   (A0, A1): P1 gets 11 (0 + 11), P2 gets 9 (20 - 11).
        *   (A1, A0): P1 gets -5 (6 - 11), P2 gets 13 (2 + 11).
        *   (A1, A1): 4 points for both.
    *   In C1, A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players. For Player 1, 10 > -5 and 11 > 4. For Player 2, 10 > 9 and 13 > 4.
    *   The new Nash Equilibrium for C1 is (A0, A0), resulting in **10 points** for Player 1.

2.  **Contract C2 Analysis:**
    *   C2 proposes no changes to the payments, making it identical to the original game.
    *   Original Nash Equilibrium (A1, A1) leads to **4 points** for Player 1.

3.  **Strategic Approval Voting:**
    *   Player 1 earns 10 points under C1 and 4 points under C2 or with no contract.
    *   According to the approval voting rule, the winning contract is chosen from those with the most approvals. If Player 1 approves only C1, it maximizes the probability of C1 being selected (or at least tied for the most votes). If Player 1 approves C2 as well, it increases the chance that the lower-paying C2 is selected instead of C1.
    *   Even if Player 2 only approves C2, the best response for Player 1 is to only approve C1 to force a tie and a random selection, resulting in an expected value (7 points) higher than approving C2 (4 points).

Therefore, the rational choice for Player 1 is to approve only Contract C1.

To maximize your total points, we need to analyze the potential outcomes of each contract and the voting game.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy (A1), as 20 > 10 and 4 > 2. Knowing this, Player 1 will choose A1 (4 points) over A0 (0 points). The equilibrium is (A1, A1) with a payoff of **4 points** for Player 1.

### 2. Analysis of the Proposed Contracts
Both contracts modify the payoffs by transferring points if a player chooses A0. Let $X$ be the payment for choosing A0.

**Contract 1 (C1): $X = 11$**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = (11, 9)
- (A1, A0): (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = (-5, 13)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)
Under C1, Player 1 has a dominant strategy (A0) because 11 > 4 and 10 > -5. Player 2 also has a dominant strategy (A0) because 10 > 9 and 13 > 4. The equilibrium is (A0, A0), resulting in **10 points** for Player 1.

**Contract 2 (C2): $X = 5$**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 5, 20 - 5) = (5, 15)
- (A1, A0): (6 - 5, 2 + 5) = (1, 7)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)
Under C2, Player 1 has a dominant strategy (A0) because 10 > 1 and 5 > 4. If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 will choose A1 (15) over A0 (10). The equilibrium is (A0, A1), resulting in **5 points** for Player 1.

### 3. Voting Strategy
Player 1 prefers the outcomes as follows: **C1 (10 pts) > C2 (5 pts) > Base Game (4 pts)**.
Player 2 prefers the outcomes as follows: **C2 (15 pts) > C1 (10 pts) > Base Game (4 pts)**.

Since the winning contract is selected from those with the maximum number of approvals, Player 1 should only approve the contract that yields the highest payoff (C1). Approving C2 as well would only help C2 win if Player 2 also votes for it, which would lower Player 1's expected points (from potentially 10 or 7.5 down to 5). By only approving C1, Player 1 ensures that if C1 is chosen, they get 10 points, and if there is a tie between C1 and C2 (because Player 2 only votes for C2), they still get an expected value of 7.5.

Therefore, Player 1 should approve only C1.

{"C1": true, "C2": false}

response:
To decide which contracts to approve, compare the game outcomes (equilibria) induced by each contract, then vote strategically given the approval rule.

## Step 1: Analyze Contract C1 (Player 1’s proposal)
C1: Choosing **A0** gives you **+11** paid by the other player.

Compute Player 2 payoffs (you are Player 2):

- (A0, A0): base 10, plus +11, minus 11 paid to other ⇒ **10**
- (A1, A0): base 20, but you pay 11 to other (since they played A0) ⇒ **9**
- (A0, A1): base 2, plus +11 ⇒ **13**
- (A1, A1): base **4**

Your best response:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives 9 ⇒ **A0**
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 13 vs A1 gives 4 ⇒ **A0**

So under C1, **A0 is strictly dominant** for you, and similarly it becomes dominant for Player 1 as well.  
Equilibrium: **(A0, A0)** giving you **10**.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract C2 (Player 2’s proposal)
C2: Choosing **A1** makes you **pay 5** to the other player.

Your (Player 2) payoffs:

- (A0, A0): **10**
- (A1, A0): 20 − 5 ⇒ **15**
- (A0, A1): 2 + 5 ⇒ **7**
- (A1, A1): **4** (payments cancel)

Player 1’s payoffs show they strictly prefer **A0** no matter what you do, so P1 plays **A0**.  
Given P1 plays A0, your best response is **A1** (15 > 10).

Equilibrium under C2: **(A1, A0)** giving you **15**.

## Step 3: Strategic voting
Player 1 prefers:
- Under C1: they get 10
- Under C2: they get 5  
So Player 1 will approve **C1** and likely reject **C2**.

If you approve:
- **Only C1** ⇒ C1 gets 2 approvals, selected for sure ⇒ you get **10**
- **Only C2** ⇒ C1 gets 1 (P1), C2 gets 1 (you), tie ⇒ random between C1 and C2  
  Expected payoff = (10 + 15)/2 = **12.5**
- **Both** ⇒ C1 gets 2, C2 gets 1 ⇒ C1 selected ⇒ you get **10**
- **Neither** ⇒ C1 still likely wins (P1 approves) ⇒ you get **10**

Best is to **approve only C2** to force a tie and get a 50% chance at the better contract.

Let's break this down step by step, carefully analyzing the game, the contract proposals, and what outcome maximizes *your* points as **Player 2**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)

We are Player 2. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | 10 (you), 10 (opp) | 2 (you), 6 (opp) |
| **A1**                        | 20 (you), 0 (opp) | 4 (you), 4 (opp) |

So as **Player 2**, your payoff matrix (from your perspective) is:

|            | A0 | A1 |
|------------|----|----|
| **A0**     | 10 | 2  |
| **A1**     | 20 | 4  |

Now compute the **best response** for Player 2.

- If opponent plays A0: your best response is A1 (20 > 10)
- If opponent plays A1: your best response is A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2** — it always gives you more than A0, regardless of opponent’s choice.

So in the base game, you would play A1 with probability 1.

Similarly, for **Player 1 (the opponent)**:

|            | A0 | A1 |
|------------|----|----|
| **A0**     | 10 | 6  |
| **A1**     | 0  | 4  |

Player 1's best response:
- If you play A0: Player 1 gets 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → chooses A0
- If you play A1: Player 1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → chooses A1

So Player 1 has no dominant strategy. But since you are playing A1 (dominant), Player 1 will play A1 (since they prefer it when you play A1).

Thus, **in equilibrium without contracts**: both play A1 → you get **4 points**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contracts

There are two proposed contracts:

---

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 11 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payment.

So, for any player who picks A0, they get +11 points, but the opponent loses 11 points (split equally? "drawn equally from the other players" — since only one other player, the entire 11 is taken from the opponent).

So, this is a **transfer**: A0 choice gives +11 to the choicer, −11 from the other player.

So it **incentivizes A0**.

But note: **only when you choose A0** do you get +11 (and the opponent loses 11). Choosing A1 gives no bonus.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

- No additional payments for A0 or A1.
- So it’s **no change** to the base game.

So it’s equivalent to playing without a contract.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Contract from Your (Player 2's) Perspective

We want to **maximize your points**, and the contract will be chosen if it gets the **maximum approvals** (and then selected at random among those).

So you need to decide which contract(s) you approve.

But note: the contract **only applies if both players agree to it via approval voting**.

Wait — clarification: "a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process."

So each player **votes** on each contract (approve or disapprove). If a contract is approved by both players, it is implemented.

But you are told: "The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

Wait — this suggests **multiple contracts** can pass, and the one selected is **chosen uniformly at random from those with the highest approval count**.

But the phrasing: "the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals" — so **only one contract gets implemented**, but it is **randomly selected among those that received the maximum approval count**.

But if a contract has 2 approvals, and another has 1, then the first is the only one with max approval, so it wins. If two contracts have 2 approvals, then one is chosen at random.

But **your goal is to maximize your expected points**.

So you’ll choose to **approve only** those contracts that will lead to **higher expected payoff for you**, given that you are trying to maximize **your own expected points**, and you want to **raise the chance** that a contract favorable to you is selected.

So we must evaluate **each contract** in terms of:
- What happens if it is implemented?
- How do your incentives change?

Let’s go.

---

### Step 4: Analyze Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)

C1: If you choose A0 → you get +11, and the opponent loses 11 (so they get −11 added to their payoff).

So the payoff matrix **with C1** becomes:

Let’s recompute payoffs for **Player 2** (you) and Player 1.

The additional 11 is paid **to the player who chooses A0**, and taken **from the other player**.

So we update payoffs.

#### For each combination, compute **your** payoff under C1:

**Case 1: You A0, Opponent A0**

- Base: you get 10, opponent gets 10
- You choose A0 → get +11 → **your total: 21**
- Opponent chooses A0 → gets +11 → but the 11 comes from you → so you lose 11 from your payoff
  - So **your final payoff: 10 + 11 − 11 = 10**
  - Wait — this is ambiguous.

Let’s clarify: "additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players"

"Drawn from the other players" — so if *you* choose A0, you get +11, and the other player (opponent) gets −11.

But **if both choose A0**, then:
- You choose A0 ⇒ you get +11
- Opponent chooses A0 ⇒ opponent gets +11
- But the +11 for you is drawn from the other player (opponent), so opponent loses 11

But the opponent also gains +11 from their own A0 choice.

So net:
- You: base 10 +11 (from contract) −11 (from opponent getting +11, which was drawn from you?) → **Wait, this is ambiguous.**

### Critical ambiguity: **Who pays whom?**

The phrase: "drawn equally from the other players"

If two players both choose A0:
- Each gets +11
- But each has to “draw” that 11 from the other player.

So each player pays 11 to the other? That would be **mutually canceling**, net zero.

But that can't be, because the 11 is **additional**, and drawn **from the other player**.

So: if **you** choose A0, you get +11, which is **taken from the opponent**.

So if **only you** choose A0, you get +11, opponent loses 11.

But if **both** choose A0, then:
- You get +11 (from contract), but it is drawn from opponent → opponent loses 11
- Opponent gets +11, but it is drawn from you → you lose 11
- So you: +11 (from contract) −11 (because you paid it) = 0 net
- Same for opponent.

But that would mean: **both choosing A0 cancels out** the contract gain.

So **net effect**:
- If only one chooses A0: the A0 player gains +11, the other loses 11.
- If both choose A0: no net effect (0 change for both)
- If both choose A1: no change
- If you choose A0, opponent chooses A1:
  - You get +11 (from contract, drawn from opponent)
  - Opponent has no A0, so no bonus, but you take +11 from them → so opponent loses 11
  - So you: +11, opponent: −11

Wait — now it's clear.

So the **contract payment is applied per player who chooses A0**, but the **money is drawn from the other player**.

But if **both** choose A0, each draws from the other: so you get +11 from opponent, and opponent gets +11 from you → but you have to pay 11 to opponent? So net: you gain 0.

So **only if exactly one player chooses A0** do they gain +11, the other loses 11.

But what if a player chooses A0? The contract gives them +11, which comes from the other player.

But if **both** choose A0, then each demands a +11 from the other.

So in that case, it's a **net zero** for both.

This is similar to a **transfer system**: a player who plays A0 gets +11 from the opponent **only if the opponent did not also play A0**.

Actually, let’s formalize:

For a player who chooses A0:
- They get +11
- This +11 comes from the *other player(s)*
- So if the other player **did not** choose A0, then the other player loses 11.
- If the other player **did** choose A0, then the other player also gains +11, so the net for the transfer is 0.

So **the net transfer is +11 to an A0 player if the other player chose A1, and 0 if the other player also chose A0**.

In effect:
- If both A0: no net transfer
- If you A0, opponent A1: you gain +11, opponent loses 11
- If you A1, opponent A0: you lose 11, opponent gains +11
- If both A1: no change

So the contract is **only effective when only one player chooses A0**.

Let’s apply this to payoff matrices.

#### New Payoff Matrix (C1) — For Player 2 (you)

| Your \ Opp | A0 | A1 |
|------------|----|----|
| **A0**     | (10 + 0) = 10? Wait — let's compute:

Wait — in case of A0 vs A0:
- Both choose A0 → both get +11 from contract, but both lose +11 to the other → net 0
- So your base is 10 → you get **10**
- Opponent gets 10

But you don't gain or lose from the contract.

So payoff: 10

But in case:
- You A0, Opponent A1:
  - You choose A0 → get +11 from opponent
  - Opponent chooses A1 → no gain, but you take 11 from them → opponent loses 11
  - You: base 2 + 11 = 13
  - Opponent: base 6 − 11 = −5

- You A1, Opponent A0:
  - You choose A1 → no gain, but opponent gets +11, which comes from you → you lose 11
  - Opponent: base 10 → +11 = 21
  - You: base 20 − 11 = 9

- You A1, Opponent A1:
  - No A0 chosen → no payments → base payoffs: you 4, opponent 4

So revised payoff matrix **for you (Player 2)** under C1:

| Your \ Opp | A0 | A1 |
|------------|----|----|
| **A0**     | 10 | 13 |
| **A1**     | 9  | 4  |

Now let’s see your best response:

- If opponent plays A0: you get 10 (A0) vs 9 (A1) → prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1: you get 13 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is now dominant**!

No matter what opponent does, you get more by playing A0.

So under C1, you *want* to play A0.

Now what will **Player 1** do?

Let’s compute Player 1’s payoff under C1:

| Opponent \ Your | A0 | A1 |
|-----------------|----|----|
| **A0**          | 10 (base) → net 10 | 6 (base) −11 = −5 |
| **A1**          | 0 +11 = 11 | 4 (base) → 4 |

Wait — check:

- Opponent A0, You A0 → both choose A0 → no net transfer → base 10 → Player 1 gets 10
- Opponent A0, You A1 → you A1 → no bonus → opponent A0 → gets +11 (from you) → but you lose 11 from base → so opponent gets 10 +11 = 21? Wait no.

Let’s be careful.

Player 1 is the opponent.

In each case:

1. **You A0, Opp A0**: both A0 → net transfer 0 → Player 1 gets base 10 → 10
2. **You A0, Opp A1**: Opp A1 → no bonus → but you A0 → you get +11, which is drawn from Opp → so Opp loses 11 → Player 1 gets base 6 − 11 = −5
3. **You A1, Opp A0**: Opp A0 → gets +11, drawn from you → you lose 11 → so Player 1 (Opp) gets base 10 + 11 = 21
4. **You A1, Opp A1**: no transfer → base 4 → Player 1 gets 4

So Player 1’s payoff under C1:

| Your \ Opp | A0 | A1 |
|------------|----|----|
| **A0**     | 10 | -5 |
| **A1**     | 21 | 4 |

So Player 1’s best responses:
- If you A0 → Opp gets 10 (A0) vs -5 (A1) → chooses A0
- If you A1 → Opp gets 21 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → chooses A0

So no matter what you do, **Player 1 will choose A0**.

Now, you (Player 2) want to maximize your payoff.

You know Player 1 will play A0 for sure.

So if you play A0: you get 10
If you play A1: you get 9

So your best choice is to play A0 → get 10

Thus, under C1, if it is implemented, **you will get 10 points**.

Previously, without contract, you got only 4.

So **C1 is better for you**.

But will Player 1 approve C1?

Player 1 proposes C1.

But does Player 1 expect to get better than 10?

Let’s see: if you (Player 2) play A0, Player 1 gets 10.
If you play A1, Player 1 gets 21.

So **Player 1 wants you to play A1**.

But you are expected to play A0 (since it maximizes *your* payoff).

So if C1 is implemented, you play A0, Player 1 gets 10.

But if you had played A1, Player 1 would get 21.

So Player 1 will be disappointed.

But the **contract is proposed by Player 1**, and it is **in their interest** only if they get a higher payoff than under the base game.

In the base game (without contract): both play A1 → Player 1 gets 4.

With C1: player 1 gets 10 (if you play A0), so **10 > 4** → better.

Even if you played A1, they’d get 21 — but you won’t.

But still, **Player 1 gets 10 under C1**, which is **better** than 4 in base game.

So they will **approve** C1, because it gives them 10, which is better than 4.

So **Player 1 will approve C1**.

Now, you (Player 2): under C1, you get **10 points** — much better than base 4.

So **you should approve C1**.

---

### Step 5: Analyze Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)

C2: no additional payments for A0 or A1.

So it's identical to the base game.

So if C2 is implemented, payoff is as base game: both play A1 (since A1 dominant for you, and you're best responding), so you get **4 points**.

You already know this.

Now, you are **Player 2**, and you are deciding whether to approve C2.

But **C2 gives you 4 points**.

C1 gives you **10 points**.

So you should **not approve C2**, because:
- It gives you less than C1.
- And it’s not even better than base game.

But wait — approval voting: if you approve C2, and C1 is also approved (by both), then C1 might be selected (if it has more approvals, but both have 2).

But if you approve **only C1**, then C1 has 2 approvals (you and Player 1), and C2 has only 1.

So **C1 wins**.

If you approve C2, but not C1, then:
- C1: approved only by Player 1 → 1 approval
- C2: approved by you and Player 2 (the proposer) → 2 approvals

So C2 wins → you get 4 points.

But if you approve **only C1**, C1 wins → you get 10 points.

So **to maximize your expected payoff**, you must **approve C1 and disapprove C2**.

But what if you approve both?

Then:
- C1: 2 approvals (you and Player 1) → max
- C2: 2 approvals (you and Player 2) → also 2 approvals
- So both have max approval → one chosen at random

You get:
- 50% chance of C1 → 10 points
- 50% chance of C2 → 4 points
- Expected payoff: 0.5×10 + 0.5×4 = 5 + 2 = 7

But if you only approve C1, then C1 wins for sure → your payoff: **10**

So 10 > 7 → better to **only approve C1**.

So your best strategy: approve **only C1**, disapprove C2.

But can you disapprove? Yes — you are free to vote.

And if you approve only C1, C1 wins → you get 10.

But is Player 1 more likely to approve C1? Yes — already shown: they get 10 > 4 → will approve.

So C1 will be approved by both → guaranteed.

Now, if you disapprove C1 and approve C2, then:
- C1: only 1 approval (Player 1) → not maximum
- C2: 2 approvals (you + proposer) → maximum → wins
- You get 4

Worse.

So **best outcome for you is to approve C1, disapprove C2**.

Thus, your approval choices:

- C1: **true**
- C2: **false**

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Understanding the Game without the Contract
Let's first analyze the payoff outcomes without any contract:

- Player 2 (You) chooses A0:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0: You get 10 points.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1: You get 2 points.
- Player 2 (You) chooses A1:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0: You get 20 points.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1: You get 4 points.

Player 1's payoffs:
- Player 1 chooses A0:
  - If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 10 points.
  - If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points.
- Player 1 chooses A1:
  - If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 6 points.
  - If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 4 points.

#### Step 2: Analyzing the Game with the Contract
With the contract, there is an additional payment structure:
- A player choosing A0 receives an additional 11 points, drawn equally from the other player (which means the other player loses 11 points).
  
Modification to payoffs:
- Player 2 (You) chooses A0:
  - If Player 1 chooses A0: You get \(10 + 11 = 21\) points, Player 1 gets \(10 - 11 = -1\) points.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1: You get \(2 + 11 = 13\) points, Player 1 gets \(6 - 11 = -5\) points.
- Player 2 (You) chooses A1 (No change in payment structure):
  - If Player 1 chooses A0: You get 20 points.
  - If Player 1 chooses A1: You get 4 points.

Player 1's payoffs with contract:
- Player 1 chooses A0:
  - If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets -1 points.
  - If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets -5 points.
- Player 1 chooses A1:
  - If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 6 points.
  - If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 4 points.

#### Step 3: Evaluating the Incentives
Let's see how these payoffs influence decisions:
- Without the contract, the highest payoff for Player 2 is achieved by choosing A1 when Player 1 chooses A0 (20 points).
- With the contract, Player 2 gets:
  - 21 points (A0-A0), which is higher than any other scenario.
  - The next best payoff becomes \(20\) points (A1-A0), which is now less favorable overall.

#### Step 4: Deciding Whether to Sign the Contract
- If both players sign the contract, Player 2 (you) would have a strong incentive to choose A0 because A0-A0 results in the highest payoff of 21 points, which outmatches the 20 points (non-contract A1-A0).
- Player 1, however:
  - Suffers significant losses when choosing A0 under the contract.
  - Might prefer to stick with A1 to avoid penalties or losses.

In conclusion:
- Essentially, the contract significantly advantages you if Player 1 signs it.
- Given that the contract heavily disincentivizes Player 1 from choosing A0 with negative outcomes, Player 1 may not reciprocate with signing.

Given this rationale should be agnostic about specific predictions from Player 1’s side and focus on whether the contract inherently tends to better your chances (which it does):

response:
To decide which contracts to approve, I compare what my (Player 2) equilibrium payoff would be under each contract, and then how the approval vote is likely to select between them.

## 1) Analyze Contract C1 (reward A0 by taking 11 from the other player)
With 2 players, “receive +11 drawn from the other player” means:
- If I play **A0** and the other plays **A1**, I gain **+11** (they lose 11).
- If I play **A1** and the other plays **A0**, I lose **11** (they gain 11).
- If both play **A0**, the transfers cancel out (net 0 each).

So my payoffs become:
- (P1 A0, P2 A0): 10  
- (P1 A0, P2 A1): 20 − 11 = 9  
- (P1 A1, P2 A0): 2 + 11 = 13  
- (P1 A1, P2 A1): 4  

Best response for me:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives 9 ⇒ **A0**
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 13 vs A1 gives 4 ⇒ **A0**

So **A0 strictly dominates** for me; similarly it dominates for Player 1.  
Equilibrium: **(A0, A0)**, giving me **10**.

## 2) Analyze Contract C2 (penalize A1 by 5 paid to the other player)
If I play **A1**, I pay 5 to the other player.

My payoffs become:
- (P1 A0, P2 A0): 10  
- (P1 A0, P2 A1): 20 − 5 = 15  
- (P1 A1, P2 A0): 2 + 5 = 7  
- (P1 A1, P2 A1): 4  (net transfer cancels)

Player 1’s best response under C2 is always **A0** (it beats A1 regardless of what I do).  
Given P1 plays **A0**, my best response is **A1** (15 > 10).

Equilibrium: **(P1 A0, P2 A1)**, giving me **15**.

## 3) Voting strategy
Player 1 prefers C1 (they get 10) over C2 (they get 5), so they will likely approve **C1** and reject **C2**.

- If I approve **both**: C1 gets 2 approvals and wins for sure ⇒ I get 10.
- If I approve **only C2**: C1 has 1 approval (P1), C2 has 1 approval (me) ⇒ tie, chosen uniformly:
  - Expected payoff = 0.5·10 + 0.5·15 = **12.5**
- If I approve **neither**: C1 wins (1 vs 0) ⇒ I get 10.

So the best move is to **approve only C2** and **reject C1**, to force a tie and get a chance at the better contract.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine whether to approve the proposed contracts, let's first analyze the base game without any contracts.

### Base Game Analysis:
The payoff matrix is as follows (Player 1 as rows, Player 2 as columns):
- (A0, A0): P1 = 10, P2 = 10
- (A0, A1): P1 = 0, P2 = 20
- (A1, A0): P1 = 6, P2 = 2
- (A1, A1): P1 = 4, P2 = 4

**P2's Perspective:**
- If P1 plays A0, P2's best response is A1 (20 > 10).
- If P1 plays A1, P2's best response is A1 (4 > 2).
Thus, A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.

**P1's Perspective:**
- If P2 plays A1 (his dominant strategy), P1's best response is A1 (4 > 0).
The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), leading to a payoff of (4, 4).

### Contract Analysis:
Both contracts specify that a player playing A0 receives an additional payment $X$ from the other player.
- **Contract 1 (C1):** $X = 11$
- **Contract 2 (C2):** $X = 12$

#### Contract 1 (X = 11):
- **(A0, A0):** P1 = 10 + 11 - 11 = 10, P2 = 10 + 11 - 11 = 10
- **(A0, A1):** P1 = 0 + 11 = 11, P2 = 20 - 11 = 9
- **(A1, A0):** P1 = 6 - 11 = -5, P2 = 2 + 11 = 13
- **(A1, A1):** P1 = 4, P2 = 4

**P1's dominant strategy in C1:** A0 (since 10 > -5 and 11 > 4).
**P2's dominant strategy in C1:** A0 (since 10 > 9 and 13 > 4).
**Nash Equilibrium in C1:** (A0, A0) with payoffs (10, 10).

#### Contract 2 (X = 12):
- **(A0, A0):** P1 = 10 + 12 - 12 = 10, P2 = 10 + 12 - 12 = 10
- **(A0, A1):** P1 = 0 + 12 = 12, P2 = 20 - 12 = 8
- **(A1, A0):** P1 = 6 - 12 = -6, P2 = 2 + 12 = 14
- **(A1, A1):** P1 = 4, P2 = 4

**P1's dominant strategy in C2:** A0 (since 10 > -6 and 12 > 4).
**P2's dominant strategy in C2:** A0 (since 10 > 8 and 14 > 4).
**Nash Equilibrium in C2:** (A0, A0) with payoffs (10, 10).

### Comparison:
In both contracts, the Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), yielding 10 points for Player 2. This is significantly better than the 4 points obtained in the base game. There is no strategic disadvantage to approving both contracts, as both lead to the same improved outcome.

response:
To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the game and the proposed contracts step by step.

### 1. Base Game Analysis
The base game payoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Nash Equilibrium:**
- If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2's best response is A1 (20 > 10).
- If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2's best response is A1 (4 > 2).
- Player 2 has a dominant strategy: **A1**.
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (4 > 0).
The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in **4 points** for Player 1.

### 2. Contract 1 (C1) Analysis
C1: A player who chooses A0 receives 11 points from the other player.
Adjusted Payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10 + 11 - 11, 10 + 11 - 11) = (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = (11, 9)
- (A1, A0): (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = (-5, 13)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Nash Equilibrium for C1:**
- Player 1's dominant strategy: A0 (10 > -5 and 11 > 4).
- Player 2's dominant strategy: A0 (10 > 9 and 13 > 4).
The Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), resulting in **10 points** for Player 1.

### 3. Contract 2 (C2) Analysis
C2: A player who chooses A1 pays 10 points to the other player.
Adjusted Payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 10, 20 - 10) = (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (6 - 10, 2 + 10) = (-4, 12)
- (A1, A1): (4 - 10 + 10, 4 - 10 + 10) = (4, 4)

**Nash Equilibrium for C2:**
- Player 1's dominant strategy: A0 (10 > -4 and 10 > 4).
- If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 10 points regardless of their choice (A0 or A1).
In any equilibrium for C2, Player 1 receives **10 points**.

### 4. Decision
Both C1 and C2 significantly improve Player 1's outcome from 4 points to 10 points. Since both contracts result in the same payoff for Player 1, and the objective is to ensure that *some* contract is selected rather than playing the base game, the optimal strategy is to approve both. This maximizes the probability that a contract (which requires at least one approval to be selected over the base game) is implemented.

Based on an analysis of the base game and the proposed contracts, here is the step-by-step breakdown of the decision-making process:

1.  **Analyze the Base Game:**
    *   The base game payoffs are: (A0, A0) = (10, 10), (A0, A1) = (0, 20), (A1, A0) = (6, 2), and (A1, A1) = (4, 4).
    *   Player 2 has a dominant strategy to choose **A1**.
    *   Knowing Player 2 will choose A1, Player 1's best response is **A1** (4 points vs. 0 points).
    *   The Nash Equilibrium for the base game is (A1, A1), resulting in **4 points** for each player.

2.  **Analyze Contract 1 (C1):**
    *   C1 adds a transfer of 11 points from the other player to anyone choosing A0.
    *   Adjusted payoffs: (A0, A0) = (10, 10), (A0, A1) = (11, 9), (A1, A0) = (-5, 13), (A1, A1) = (4, 4).
    *   Both players now have a dominant strategy to choose **A0**.
    *   The Nash Equilibrium for C1 is (A0, A0), resulting in **10 points** for Player 1.

3.  **Analyze Contract 2 (C2):**
    *   C2 adds a penalty of 5 points for choosing A1, which is given to the other player.
    *   Adjusted payoffs: (A0, A0) = (10, 10), (A0, A1) = (5, 15), (A1, A0) = (1, 7), (A1, A1) = (4, 4).
    *   Player 1 has a dominant strategy to choose **A0**.
    *   If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2's best response is **A1** (15 points vs. 10 points).
    *   The Nash Equilibrium for C2 is (A0, A1), resulting in **5 points** for Player 1.

4.  **Evaluate Approval Voting:**
    *   Player 1's potential payoffs: C1 (10), C2 (5), Base Game (4).
    *   Player 2's potential payoffs: C1 (10), C2 (15), Base Game (4).
    *   Player 1 wants to maximize their points. Approving both C1 and C2 would risk C2 winning if Player 2 only approves C2 or if the contracts tie.
    *   By only approving **C1**, Player 1 ensures the best possible outcome for themselves. If Player 2 also approves C1, C1 wins. If Player 2 only approves C2, the contracts tie and are selected at random (average 7.5 points for Player 1). If Player 1 approved both, and Player 2 only approved C2, C2 would win outright (5 points for Player 1).

Conclusion: Player 1 maximizes their expected utility by approving only Contract 1.

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 12 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to compare the likely outcomes of the game with and without the contract.

### 1. Analyzing the Original Game (Without the Contract)
The original payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Let's find the Nash Equilibrium (NE):
- **Player 2's strategy:** If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets more from A1 (20) than A0 (10). If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets more from A1 (4) than A0 (2). Therefore, A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.
- **Player 1's strategy:** Knowing Player 2 will likely choose A1, Player 1's best response is to choose A1 (4 points) over A0 (0 points).
- **Result:** The only Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), where both players receive **4 points**.

### 2. Analyzing the Game With the Contract
The contract adds a payment of 12 points to any player who chooses A0, paid for by the other player(s).
New Payoff Calculations:
- **(A0, A0):** Both get +12 and pay -12. Net change is 0. Payoffs: **(10, 10)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 gets +12, Player 2 pays -12. Payoffs: (0+12, 20-12) = **(12, 8)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 2 gets +12, Player 1 pays -12. Payoffs: (6-12, 2+12) = **(-6, 14)**.
- **(A1, A1):** No payments. Payoffs: **(4, 4)**.

Nash Equilibrium with the contract:
- **Player 1's strategy:** If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 prefers A0 (10 > -6). If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 prefers A0 (12 > 4). A0 is now a dominant strategy for Player 1.
- **Player 2's strategy:** If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 prefers A0 (10 > 8). If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 prefers A0 (14 > 4). A0 is now a dominant strategy for Player 2.
- **Result:** The new Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), where both players receive **10 points**.

### 3. Comparison and Conclusion
- **Without Contract:** Both players receive 4 points.
- **With Contract:** Both players receive 10 points.

Since 10 points is significantly better than 4 points, signing the contract is the optimal decision for maximizing total points. Player 2 proposed the contract, making it highly likely they will also sign it.

### 1. Game Without the Contract
The payoff matrix for the original game is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Nash Equilibrium Analysis:**
- If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2's best response is A1 (20 > 10).
- If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2's best response is A1 (4 > 2).
- Thus, Player 2 has a dominant strategy: **A1**.
- Knowing Player 2 will choose A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (4 > 0).
- The Nash Equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Game With the Contract
The contract specifies that if a player chooses A0, they receive 11 points from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** P1 gets $10 + 11 - 11 = 10$; P2 gets $10 + 11 - 11 = 10$.
- **(A0, A1):** P1 gets $0 + 11 = 11$; P2 gets $20 - 11 = 9$.
- **(A1, A0):** P1 gets $6 - 11 = -5$; P2 gets $2 + 11 = 13$.
- **(A1, A1):** P1 gets $4$; P2 gets $4$.

**Nash Equilibrium Analysis With Contract:**
- **For Player 1:**
  - If P2 chooses A0: P1's best response is A0 (10 > -5).
  - If P2 chooses A1: P1's best response is A0 (11 > 4).
  - Player 1 now has a dominant strategy: **A0**.
- **For Player 2:**
  - If P1 chooses A0: P2's best response is A0 (10 > 9).
  - If P1 chooses A1: P2's best response is A0 (13 > 4).
  - Player 2 now has a dominant strategy: **A0**.
- The new Nash Equilibrium is **(A0, A0)**, resulting in **10 points** for each player.

### 3. Decision
- **Without the contract:** The expected payoff for Player 1 is 4 points.
- **With the contract:** The expected payoff for Player 1 is 10 points.

Since both players benefit from moving the equilibrium from (A1, A1) to (A0, A0), it is highly likely that both players will sign. If the other player signs, signing is clearly beneficial for Player 1. If the other player does not sign, the contract is not activated, and the outcome remains the same as the original game. Therefore, signing the contract is the optimal strategy.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the total points for both the basic game and the game with the contract active.

### 1. Basic Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for the basic game (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Nash Equilibrium (Basic Game):**
- If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2's best response is A1 (20 > 10).
- If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2's best response is A1 (4 > 2).
- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1's best response is A0 (10 > 6).
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (4 > 0).
The Nash Equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Contract Analysis
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."
- **Scenario (A0, A0):** Both receive 11 and lose 11. Net change is 0.
  - Payoff: (10+11-11, 10+11-11) = **(10, 10)**
- **Scenario (A0, A1):** Player 1 receives 11, Player 2 loses 11.
  - Payoff: (0+11, 20-11) = **(11, 9)**
- **Scenario (A1, A0):** Player 1 loses 11, Player 2 receives 11.
  - Payoff: (6-11, 2+11) = **(-5, 13)**
- **Scenario (A1, A1):** No changes.
  - Payoff: **(4, 4)**

**Nash Equilibrium (Contract Game):**
- **Player 1's perspective:**
  - If Player 2 plays A0: A0 (10) vs A1 (-5). Choice: **A0**.
  - If Player 2 plays A1: A0 (11) vs A1 (4). Choice: **A0**.
  A0 is now the dominant strategy for Player 1.
- **Player 2's perspective:**
  - If Player 1 plays A0: A0 (10) vs A1 (9). Choice: **A0**.
  - If Player 1 plays A1: A0 (13) vs A1 (4). Choice: **A0**.
  A0 is now the dominant strategy for Player 2.
The new Nash Equilibrium is **(A0, A0)**, resulting in **10 points** for each player.

### 3. Conclusion
- If the contract is **not signed**, the players will likely default to the Nash Equilibrium of the basic game, which is (A1, A1) yielding **4 points**.
- If the contract **is signed**, the players will likely move to (A0, A0) yielding **10 points**.
Since 10 points is significantly better than 4 points, and Player 2 also has a strong incentive to sign (as they also benefit from 10 points vs 4 points), signing the contract is the optimal decision.

response:
Let's analyze this decision step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without contract)

The payoff matrix (Player 1's choice along rows, Player 2's choice along columns) is as follows, with (Player 1 payoff, Player 2 payoff):

|               | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)**   | (10, 10) | (2, 6) |
| **A1 (P2)**   | (20, 0) | (4, 4) |

We are Player 2. Our goal is to maximize our own expected payoff.

Let’s examine the best responses.

---

### Step 2: Check if there’s a dominant strategy for Player 2 in the original game

#### Suppose Player 1 plays A0:
- If we play A0 → we get 10
- If we play A1 → we get 0
→ So we prefer A0

#### Suppose Player 1 plays A1:
- If we play A0 → we get 2
- If we play A1 → we get 4
→ So we prefer A1

Therefore, **Player 2 has no dominant strategy** — our best choice depends on what Player 1 does.

Let’s look for a Nash equilibrium.

---

### Step 3: Look for mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (original game)

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ p $, A1 with $ 1 - p $.

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If Player 2 plays A0: $ 10p + 2(1 - p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $
- If Player 2 plays A1: $ 0p + 4(1 - p) = 4 - 4p $

Set equal to find indifference point:
$$
8p + 2 = 4 - 4p \\
12p = 2 \\
p = \frac{1}{6}
$$

So if Player 1 plays A0 with $ \frac{1}{6} $, Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability $ q $, A1 with $ 1 - q $.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If Player 1 plays A0: $ 10q + 20(1 - q) = 10q + 20 - 20q = 20 - 10q $
- If Player 1 plays A1: $ 10q + 4(1 - q) = 10q + 4 - 4q = 6q + 4 $

Set equal:
$$
20 - 10q = 6q + 4 \\
20 - 4 = 16q \\
16 = 16q \Rightarrow q = 1
$$

So Player 2 must play A0 with probability 1 to make Player 1 indifferent.

But earlier we found Player 1 plays A0 with $ p = 1/6 $. So mixed strategy equilibrium exists:
- Player 1: A0 with $ \frac{1}{6} $, A1 with $ \frac{5}{6} $
- Player 2: A0 with 1 (pure A0)

Wait — that seems inconsistent. Let’s double-check.

Wait: when we set Player 1’s expected payoffs equal for A0 and A1, we found:
$$
20 - 10q = 6q + 4 \Rightarrow q = 1
$$

This implies **Player 2 must play A0 with probability 1** to make Player 1 indifferent.

But earlier, we found that Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ p = 1/6 $ to make Player 2 indifferent.

So is there a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium?

Actually, let's reconsider: if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 1, then:
- Player 1’s payoff from A0: 10
- Player 1’s payoff from A1: 20 (since Player 2 plays A0) → so Player 1 prefers A1

So Player 1 will never play A0 if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 1.

Hence, no mixed strategy where both are indifferent in that way.

Let’s instead check for **pure strategy equilibria**.

Check (A0, A0): (10,10)
- If Player 1 deviates to A1: gets 20 (since P2 plays A0) → better
→ Not equilibrium

Check (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- If Player 2 deviates to A1: gets 4 > 0 → better
→ Not equilibrium

Check (A0, A1): (2, 6)
- If Player 1 deviates to A0: gets 10 > 2 → better
→ Not equilibrium

Check (A1, A1): (4, 4)
- If Player 1 deviates to A0: gets 20? No — if Player 1 plays A0, and Player 2 plays A1 → (2,6), so Player 1 gets 2 < 4 → worse
- If Player 2 deviates to A0: gets 2 < 4 → worse
→ So **(A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium**

But this is not the only one? Let’s confirm:

At (A1, A1):
- Player 1: if changes to A0 → gets 2 < 4 → no
- Player 2: if changes to A0 → gets 2 < 4 → no
→ So yes, (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

But earlier we saw that (A1, A0) is not, because P2 wants to deviate.

So the only **pure** Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), yielding 4 points for each.

Are there mixed? Let’s suppose both play mixed.

Let P1 play A0 with $ p $, P2 play A0 with $ q $.

P1's expected payoff:
- A0: 10q + 2(1-q) = 8q + 2
- A1: 20q + 4(1 - q) = 20q + 4 - 4q = 16q + 4

Set equal for indifference:
8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → -8q = 2 → q = -0.25 → not possible

So P1 has no mixing strategy to keep P2 indifferent? Wait, no — this is P1’s best response.

Wait: for P2’s strategy to be optimal, P1 must be indifferent between A0 and A1.

So set P1's expected payoffs equal:

8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → -8q = 2 → q = -0.25 → impossible.

So no mixed strategy where P1 is indifferent.

Therefore, **only pure Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**.

So in the original game, if both are rational, they might end up at (A1, A1), each getting 4 points.

But is this the only outcome? Not necessarily — if they can coordinate.

But since it's simultaneous and no communication, (A1, A1) is a self-enforcing outcome.

However, let's now bring in the contract.

---

### Step 4: Understand the contract

**Contract terms:**
- If a player chooses A0 → they receive +11 points
- This 11 points is drawn **equally from the other player(s)** → so it’s taken from the other player
- If a player chooses A1 → no additional payment

So, the contract **adds 11 points to the player who chooses A0**, and **subtracts 11 points from the other player**.

Important: **The contract is only active if all players sign it.**

We are Player 2. We decide whether to sign. If we sign, and the other player also signs, then the contract becomes active.

But currently, we are **just deciding whether to sign**, and we know the contract was proposed by Player 1 and passed via approval voting — so **Player 1 has approved it and will sign**, assuming they are rational.

Therefore, **we will only benefit from the contract if we sign it**.

So the effective outcome depends on **our choice**: sign or not.

---

### Step 5: Analyze payoffs **with** the contract (if we sign it)

The contract modifies the base payoffs.

Let’s rewrite the payoff matrix **under the contract**, assuming **we sign** the contract.

Note: the contract applies to both players, so if both sign, then:
- When a player plays A0, they get +11, but the other player loses 11 (so net transfer)
- When a player plays A1, no change

So we can compute adjusted payoffs.

Let’s build the new payoff matrix (for Player 2), assuming the contract is active (i.e., both signed).

Original payoffs (P1, P2):

1. (A0, A0): (10, 10)  
→ P2 plays A0 → gets +11, but P1 also plays A0 → P1 gets +11 → so net:  
P2 gets: 10 + 11 = 21  
P1 gets: 10 + 11 = 21  
BUT: the 11 is drawn from the other player — wait, **this is ambiguous**

Let’s re-read: “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”

Important: **"drawn equally from the other players"**.

Since there are two players, “equally” means each other player pays 5.5? Or the entire 11 comes from the other player?

But if both players choose A0, then both receive +11, so both draw 11 from the other? That would imply:

- P1 gets +11 from P2
- P2 gets +11 from P1

So net effect:
- P1 gets: 10 + 11 (from P2) - 11 (paid to P2) = 10 → no change?
Wait no: the **additional payment** is given to the player who chooses A0, and it is **taken from the other player(s)**.

But if both choose A0, then:
- P1 gets +11
- P2 gets +11
But both receive +11 from the other? Can you draw 11 from someone who is also receiving from you?

This creates a contradiction unless the 11 is not "drawn from" in the sense of net transfer, but rather a global adjustment.

Wait — let’s parse: "they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

This implies that if you play A0, you get 11 more, and those 11 come **from** the other players.

So **if only one player plays A0**, that player gets +11 from the other player → the other loses 11.

But if both play A0, **each** gets +11, so where do those 11 come from?

"Drawn equally from the other players" — if you are the only player who did A0, then you get 11 from the other.

But if both do A0, then P1 gets 11 from P2, and P2 gets 11 from P1.

So net:
- P1: +11 (from P2) - 11 (paid to P2) = 0 change? That can’t be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 is a **net transfer**, and both can’t simultaneously benefit and be paid.

The key is: **the payment is a side effect of playing A0, not dependent on others’ actions**, so it must be that **the contract adds 11 to the player who chooses A0**, and **subtracts 11 from the player who chooses A1?**

But that contradicts the description.

Wait — re-reading: “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”

So:
- Whenever a player chooses A0, they get +11.
- This +11 is *funded* from the other player(s).

So if only one player chooses A0, that player gets +11 from the other.

If both choose A0, each gets +11, so each has to pay 11 to the other? That would result in net zero change.

But that would mean:
- (A0, A0): both still get original payoff (10,10), because +11 and -11 cancel.
- (A1, A0): P2 plays A0 → gets +11, so P2's payoff increases by 11, P1’s decreases by 11.
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +11, P2’s payoff decreased by 11.
- (A1, A1): no one plays A0 → no additional payments → original payoffs: (4,4)

But this seems inconsistent — why would both players get +11 if both play A0, and pay each other?

Let me clarify with a standard interpretation in mechanism design.

This is a **side payment contract**: when a player chooses A0, they get +11, but that 11 is **taken from the other players collectively**.

So if **both** players choose A0, then each gets +11 from the other, but each must **pay** 11 to the other → so net effect: zero.

Thus, **Net change from contract** in each case:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------|----|----|
| A0      | (0,0) → new payoffs: (10,10) | (-11, +11) → P1 gets -11, P2 gets +11 |
| A1      | (+11, -11) → P1 gets +11, P2 gets -11 | (0,0) → (4,4) |

Therefore, **the contract adds 11 to a player who chooses A0 and subtracts 11 from the other player if the other chose A1. If both choose A0, no net change (offsetting).**

Wait — but “drawn equally from the other players” — so if there’s only one other player, they contribute the entire 11. But if two, each contributes half.

But here, there are only two players.

So: if a player plays A0, they get +11, **funded by the other player** — so the other player loses 11.

Thus:
- Only if **both** play A0: each gets +11 from the other, so net zero change.
- If only P1 plays A0, P1 gets +11, P2 loses 11
- If only P2 plays A0, P2 gets +11, P1 loses 11
- If neither plays A0: no change

Yes, this makes sense.

So now, we can compute the **new payoff matrix (Player 2)** under the contract:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (10, 10) | (2 - 11, 6 + 11) = (-9, 17) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (20 + 11, 0 - 11) = (31, -11) | (4, 4) |

Let’s verify:

1. (A0, A0): both play A0 → no net effect → (10, 10)
2. (A0, A1): P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets +11, P2 gets -11 → so P2 gets 6 - 11 = -5? Wait no.

Wait — correction:

In (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +11 (from P2)
P2 plays A1 → gets no bonus, but since P1 played A0, P2 must **pay** 11 → so P2’s payoff decreases by 11.

Original P2 payoff was 6 → now 6 - 11 = -5

P1’s payoff: original 2, plus +11 = 13

Similarly:
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 (no bonus), P2 plays A0 (gets +11), and P1 must pay 11 → P2 gets 2 + 11 = 13, P1 gets 20 - 11 = 9

- (A1, A1): no one plays A0 → no change → (4,4)

Wait earlier I said (A1, A0): P1 gets +11, P2 gets -11 — no.

If P2 plays A0, then P2 gets +11, and P1 must pay 11.

So for (A1, A0): 
- P2 gets +11
- P1 must pay 11 → so P1’s payoff = 20 - 11 = 9
- P2’s payoff = 2 + 11 = 13

For (A0, A1): 
- P1 gets +11
- P2 must pay 11 → P2 gets 6 - 11 = -5
- P1 gets 2 + 11 = 13

For (A0, A0): both get +11, but both pay 11 to each other → net zero → (10,10)

For (A1, A1): (4,4)

So the corrected payoff matrix under contract is:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1        |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| A0      | (10, 10) | (13, -5)  |
| A1      | (9, 13)  | (4, 4)    |

Now, Player 2’s payoffs:

- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (if A0), -5 (if A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 9 (if A0), 4 (if A1) → prefers A0 (9 > 4)

So **in both cases, A0 gives higher payoff for Player 2**!

Therefore, **A0 is a dominant strategy** for Player 2 under the contract.

Thus, if the contract is active, Player 2 will play A0.

What does Player 1 do?

P1’s payoffs:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (if A0), 9 (if A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 13 (if A0), 4 (if A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is also dominant for Player 1** under the contract.

Therefore, **both play A0**, and the outcome is (10, 10).

So **if we sign the contract**, both players end up playing A0, and each gets 10 points.

Now, **what if we don’t sign the contract?**

Then the contract is not active, so the original game applies.

As we saw earlier, the only pure Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), yielding 4 points.

But could we get more?

Suppose we don't sign. Then the contract is inactive.

We are Player 2.

We can choose to play A0 or A1.

But Player 1’s choice is unknown.

But in the original game, we can try to predict.

Earlier, we found that (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

But is there another?

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ p $

P2’s expected payoff from:
- A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2
- A1: 0p + 4(1-p) = 4 - 4p

Set equal: 8p + 2 = 4 - 4p → 12p = 2 → p = 1/6

So if Player 1 plays A0 with 1/6, P2 is indifferent.

But if P2 plays A0 with any probability >0, then Player 1’s best response?

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10q + 20(1-q) = 20 - 10q
- A1: 10q + 4(1-q) = 6q + 4

Set equal: 20 - 10q = 6q + 4 → 16 = 16q → q=1

So only if P2 plays A0 with probability 1, Player 1 is indifferent.

But if P2 plays A0 with probability 1, Player 1 gets 10 from A0, 20 from A1 → so plays A1.

So best response cycle.

But in practice, the only stable outcome is (A1, A1), each getting 4.

Alternative: can we coordinate on (A0, A0)? It gives 10 each.

But is it a Nash equilibrium? No, because if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 from A0, but 20 from A1 → prefers A1.

So P1 would deviate.

Thus, (A0, A0) is not stable.

Therefore, without contract, the only stable outcome is (A1, A1), payoff (4,4)

But **if we sign the contract, we get (10,10)** — which is much better.

But wait — can we get more than 10?

In the contract world, we are forced into A0 for both players — (10,10)

But what if we deviate? No, because A0 is dominant — so both will play A0.

No reason to play A1.

So we get 10.

Without contract, we get at best 4.

But is there a chance to get more?

Suppose we don't sign the contract, and we play A0. But if Player 1 plays A1, we get only 2.

If Player 1 plays A0, we get 10.

But Player 1, in original game, will play A1 unless we can make them prefer A0.

But as above, (A0, A0) is not stable.

So if Player 1 expects us to play A0, they will play A1 → we get 2.

So we expect worst-case 2 or 4.

Whereas if we sign the contract, we get a **guaranteed 10**.

Moreover, the contract can enforce cooperation.

Now, **is there any downside** to signing?

Only if the contract causes us to lose points.

But in this case, it forces a better outcome.

Wait — but what if Player 2 plays A0 and Player 1 plays A1? Then under contract, P2 gets -5.

But with contract, P2 is incentivized to play A0 only if it's beneficial.

But as we saw, **A0 is dominant for P2** under contract.

So if we sign, and Player 1 signs, outcome is (A0, A0) → 10 each.

If we don’t sign, we get likely 4 or less.

Therefore, **signing the contract leads to a higher guaranteed payoff**.

But what if we sign and Player 1 doesn’t? But the contract requires **all players** to sign.

Since Player 1 has already approved, and the contract passed voting, we can assume **Player 1 will sign** — otherwise the contract wouldn’t be active.

The contract becomes active only if ALL sign.

So if we **do not sign**, the contract is not active.

But if we **do sign**, and Player 1 signs, then contract is active.

Since Player 1 has already approved, we can assume they will sign.

Thus, **if we sign, contract becomes active, and we get 10 for sure**.

If we don’t sign, contract inactive, and in original game, we expect **no better than 4**, and possibly worse (e.g., 2 if they play A1).

Hence, **signing the contract is clearly better**.

But wait — one more check: is there any reason not to sign?

Suppose the contract leads to a lower outcome.

But no — it leads to (10,10) instead of (4,4).

Even in the case where one player deviates?

But we saw that **A0 is dominant**, so no incentive to deviate.

For instance:
- If P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A0 (10 > 9)
- If P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 (10 > -5)

So both strictly prefer A0.

Thus, **(A0, A0) is the unique Nash equilibrium under contract**.

Final outcome: 10 points.

Without contract: at best 10 if we coordinate, but coordination is unstable — likely 4.

So best to **sign**.

response:
To determine the best probability distribution for my actions in this game, let's start by considering the payoffs and how the contract affects them. 

### Payoff Matrix Analysis
Here's a simplified table showing the points I can expect based on the actions chosen by both players:

| My Action | Opponent's Action | My Points | Opponent's Points |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| A0        | A0                | 10        | 10                |
| A1        | A0                | 20        | 0                 |
| A0        | A1                | 2         | 6                 |
| A1        | A1                | 4         | 4                 |

### Contract Effects
The contract adds a layer of complexity:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 11 points from the other player.
- Therefore, my final adjusted points are:
  - When I choose A0 and opponent chooses A0: \(10 + 11 = 21\)
  - When I choose A1 and opponent chooses A0: \(20 - 11 = 9\)
  - When I choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: \(2 + 11 = 13\)
  - When I choose A1 and opponent chooses A1: \(4 + 0 = 4\)

### Adjusted Payoff Matrix
Let's rewrite the matrix accounting for the contract:

| My Action | Opponent's Action | My Adjusted Points | Opponent's Adjusted Points |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| A0        | A0                | 21                 | -1                        |
| A1        | A0                | 9                  | -11                       |
| A0        | A1                | 13                 | -5                        |
| A1        | A1                | 4                  | 4                         |

### Calculation of Expected Payoffs
Let's consider the expected value of my choices based on a mixed strategy where \(p\) is the probability I choose A0 and \(1-p\) is the probability I choose A1.

1. **If the opponent always chooses A0**:
   - Expected payoff: \(21p + 9(1-p) = 21p + 9 - 9p = 12p + 9\)

2. **If the opponent always chooses A1**:
   - Expected payoff: \(13p + 4(1-p) = 13p + 4 - 4p = 9p + 4\)

3. **If opponent uses a mixed strategy \(q\) for A0 and \(1-q\) for A1**:
   - Expected payoff: \(q(12p + 9) + (1-q)(9p + 4)\)

4. **Balancing Equations**:
   We look to maximize our payoff by considering the best responses. 

Given this setup, it’s difficult to directly solve without knowing the opponent’s strategy, but considering both scenarios implies a dominant trend:

- Choosing A0 gives me a higher payoff when facing A0 and a reasonably good payoff facing A1, primarily due to the contract penalty/bonus system.

### Optimal Strategy
Due to the substantial bonus for choosing A0 and no direct knowledge of the opponent's strategy, the strategical analysis favors choosing A0:

- We assume opponent might mix their strategy but expecting a Nash equilibrium, my weighted decision seems to be more favorable towards A0.

Thus, it makes sense to choose A0 a majority of the time to capitalize on the extra points from the contract.

### Final JSON Object
```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```
### Conclusion
Based on the given information and the contract's influence, it is most beneficial for Player 2 to choose A0 with a 100% probability to maximize total points.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we first analyze the game's payoffs both with and without the contract.

### Original Game Analysis
The payoffs for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2, you) are as follows:
- (A0, A0): P1=10, P2=10
- (A0, A1): P1=0, P2=20
- (A1, A0): P1=6, P2=2
- (A1, A1): P1=4, P2=4

In this game, Player 2's dominant strategy is **A1** (since 20 > 10 and 4 > 2). If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 will choose **A1** (since 4 > 0). The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) with a payoff of **4 points each**.

### Contract Game Analysis
The contract adds an 11-point incentive for choosing A0, which is deducted from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** Each receives 10 points. P1 gets +11 (from P2) and -11 (to P2); P2 gets +11 (from P1) and -11 (to P1). Final payoff: **(10, 10)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Original (0, 20). P1 gets +11 (from P2). Final payoff: **(11, 9)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Original (6, 2). P2 gets +11 (from P1). Final payoff: **(-5, 13)**.
- **(A1, A1):** No incentives applied. Final payoff: **(4, 4)**.

Now, let's look at the dominant strategies in the contract game:
- **For Player 2:** If P1 chooses A0, P2 prefers A0 (10 > 9). If P1 chooses A1, P2 prefers A0 (13 > 4). Thus, **A0** is Player 2's dominant strategy.
- **For Player 1:** If P2 chooses A0, P1 prefers A0 (10 > -5). If P2 chooses A1, P1 prefers A0 (11 > 4). Thus, **A0** is Player 1's dominant strategy.

The new Nash Equilibrium with the contract is **(A0, A0)**, which yields **10 points each**.

### Conclusion
By signing the contract, the Nash Equilibrium shifts from (A1, A1) giving 4 points to (A0, A0) giving 10 points. Since Player 1 proposed the contract, they are highly likely to sign it. Signing the contract is the optimal decision to maximize total points.

### 1. Game Analysis (Without Contract)

- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Player 2's perspective:**
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 10 (A0) or 20 (A1). A1 is better.
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 2 (A0) or 4 (A1). A1 is better.
Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play **A1**.

**Player 1's perspective:**
- Knowing Player 2 will play A1 (its dominant strategy), Player 1 chooses between (A0, A1) yielding 0 points or (A1, A1) yielding 4 points. Player 1 will choose **A1**.

**Nash Equilibrium (No Contract):** Both players choose A1, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Contract Analysis
The contract parameters: Choosing A0 results in a payment of 12 points from the other player.
If both sign:
- **(A0, A0):** Both receive 10. Both pay and receive 12. Net: **(10, 10)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 (+12), Player 2 chooses A1 (no adjustment). Player 1: 0 + 12 = 12. Player 2: 20 - 12 = 8. Payoff: **(12, 8)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 2 chooses A0 (+12), Player 1 chooses A1 (no adjustment). Player 1: 6 - 12 = -6. Player 2: 2 + 12 = 14. Payoff: **(-6, 14)**.
- **(A1, A1):** No A0 choices. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.

**New Matrix (With Contract):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (12, 8)
- (A1, A0): (-6, 14)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Player 2's new logic:**
- If P1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 10 (A0) vs 8 (A1). A0 is better.
- If P1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 14 (A0) vs 4 (A1). A0 is better.
Player 2 now has a dominant strategy to play **A0**.

**Player 1's new logic:**
- If P2 plays A0: Player 1 gets 10 (A0) vs -6 (A1). A0 is better.
- If P2 plays A1: Player 1 gets 12 (A0) vs 4 (A1). A0 is better.
Player 1 now has a dominant strategy to play **A0**.

**Nash Equilibrium (With Contract):** Both players choose A0, resulting in **10 points** for each player.

### 3. Conclusion
Signing the contract shifts the equilibrium from (A1, A1) with 4 points to (A0, A0) with 10 points for Player 2. Since 10 is significantly higher than 4, and the contract was proposed by Player 2, signing is the optimal strategy to maximize points.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to compare the likely outcomes of the game both with and without the contract.

### 1. Game Without the Contract
The payoff matrix for the original game is:
*   (A0, A0): You 10, Other 10
*   (A0, A1): You 0, Other 20
*   (A1, A0): You 6, Other 2
*   (A1, A1): You 4, Other 4

In this game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy. If you play A0, they get 20 for playing A1 versus 10 for playing A0. If you play A1, they get 4 for playing A1 versus 2 for playing A0. Thus, Player 2 will always choose A1. Knowing this, if Player 2 is playing A1, your best response is A1 (getting 4 points) rather than A0 (getting 0 points). This results in a Nash Equilibrium of **(A1, A1)**, where you receive **4 points**.

### 2. Game With the Contract
The contract specifies that if a player chooses A0, they receive +11 points drawn from the other player. Let's calculate the new payoffs:
*   **(A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Your payoff is 10 + 11 (for your A0) - 11 (for the other's A0) = **10**. The other player's payoff is 10 + 11 - 11 = **10**.
*   **(A0, A1):** You choose A0, the other chooses A1. Your payoff is 0 + 11 = **11**. The other player's payoff is 20 - 11 = **9**.
*   **(A1, A0):** You choose A1, the other chooses A0. Your payoff is 6 - 11 = **-5**. The other player's payoff is 2 + 11 = **13**.
*   **(A1, A1):** Both choose A1. No payments. Payoffs are **(4, 4)**.

In this version:
*   **For You:** If the other player plays A0, you prefer A0 (10 > -5). If the other player plays A1, you prefer A0 (11 > 4). A0 is your dominant strategy.
*   **For the Other Player:** If you play A0, they prefer A0 (10 > 9). If you play A1, they prefer A0 (13 > 4). A0 is their dominant strategy.

This results in a Nash Equilibrium of **(A0, A0)**, where you receive **10 points**.

### 3. Conclusion
The contract changes the dominant strategies for both players, moving the equilibrium from (A1, A1) worth 4 points to (A0, A0) worth 10 points. Since the contract only becomes active if both players sign, and it is in the best interest of both players to move from the 4-point outcome to the 10-point outcome, signing the contract is the optimal decision.

- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
Looking at this decision problem, I need to analyze how each contract would affect the game's Nash equilibrium and my expected payoff.

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game (No Contract)

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:

**My Payoffs:**
```
           P1: A0   P1: A1
P2: A0      10       2
P2: A1      20       4
```

**Player 1's Payoffs:**
```
           P1: A0   P1: A1
P2: A0      10       6
P2: A1       0       4
```

In the base game:
- **For me (P2):** A1 strictly dominates A0 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2)
- **For P1:** Given I'll play A1, they prefer A1 over A0 (4 > 0)
- **Nash Equilibrium:** (A1, A1) → I get **4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1: Players choosing A0 get +11 from the other player.

**Modified payoffs for me:**
```
           P1: A0        P1: A1
P2: A0      10           13 (I get +11 from P1)
P2: A1       9 (I pay 11) 4
```

**Modified payoffs for P1:**
```
           P1: A0        P1: A1
P2: A0      10           -5 (pays me 11)
P2: A1      11 (gets 11)  4
```

Analysis:
- **For me:** A0 now strictly dominates A1 (10 > 9 and 13 > 4)
- **For P1:** A0 strictly dominates A1 (10 > -5 and 11 > 4)
- **Nash Equilibrium:** (A0, A0) → I get **10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2: Players choosing A1 pay 10 to the other player.

**Modified payoffs for me:**
```
           P1: A0         P1: A1
P2: A0      10            12 (P1 pays me 10)
P2: A1      10 (I pay 10)  4
```

**Modified payoffs for P1:**
```
           P1: A0         P1: A1
P2: A0      10            -4 (pays me 10)
P2: A1      10 (gets 10)   4
```

Analysis:
- **For me:** A0 weakly dominates A1 (10 = 10 and 12 > 4)
- **For P1:** A0 strictly dominates A1 (10 > -4 and 10 > 4)
- **Nash Equilibrium:** (A0, A0) → I get **10 points**

## Step 4: Decision

Comparing outcomes:
- **No contract:** 4 points
- **Contract 1:** 10 points
- **Contract 2:** 10 points

Both contracts lead to the same cooperative outcome (A0, A0) and give me 10 points, which is significantly better than the 4 points I'd get without any contract. Since both contracts are equally beneficial to me and strictly better than no contract, I should approve both to:

1. Maximize the probability that some contract is implemented
2. Ensure I get 10 points regardless of which contract wins

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine whether Player 1 should sign the contract, let's analyze the game's payoffs both with and without the contract.

### 1. Original Game Analysis
The original payoff matrix is:
- **(A0, A0):** P1 = 10, P2 = 10
- **(A0, A1):** P1 = 0, P2 = 20
- **(A1, A0):** P1 = 6, P2 = 2
- **(A1, A1):** P1 = 4, P2 = 4

**Player 2's perspective:**
- If P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) or 20 (A1). A1 is better.
- If P1 chooses A1: P2 gets 2 (A0) or 4 (A1). A1 is better.
Player 2 has a dominant strategy to choose **A1**.

**Player 1's perspective:**
Knowing Player 2 will likely choose A1:
- If P1 chooses A0: P1 gets 0.
- If P1 chooses A1: P1 gets 4.
In the original game, both players are likely to play **A1**, resulting in a payoff of **(4, 4)**.

### 2. Contracted Game Analysis
The contract adds 11 points to any player who chooses A0, taken from the other player. Let's recalculate the matrix:
- **(A0, A0):**
    P1: 10 + 11 (for A0) - 11 (from P2's A0) = 10
    P2: 10 + 11 (for A0) - 11 (from P1's A0) = 10
- **(A0, A1):**
    P1: 0 + 11 (for A0) = 11
    P2: 20 - 11 (from P1's A0) = 9
- **(A1, A0):**
    P1: 6 - 11 (from P2's A0) = -5
    P2: 2 + 11 (for A0) = 13
- **(A1, A1):**
    P1: 4, P2: 4

**Dominance in the Contracted Game:**
- **For Player 1:** A0 is dominant. (If P2 plays A0: 10 > -5; if P2 plays A1: 11 > 4).
- **For Player 2:** A0 is dominant. (If P1 plays A0: 10 > 9; if P1 plays A1: 13 > 4).

In the contracted game, both players have a dominant strategy to choose **A0**, resulting in a payoff of **(10, 10)**.

### 3. Decision to Sign
- If the contract is signed by both, the outcome is **10** for P1.
- If the contract is not signed by both, the game reverts to the original rules where the expected outcome is **4** for P1.

Since 10 is significantly better than 4, and the contract transforms the game from a suboptimal equilibrium (A1, A1) into a superior one (A0, A0), it is in Player 1's best interest to sign.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!


Instruction:
- Choose a probability distribution over the provided actions each round.
- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

Return exactly one JSON object, for example:
{"A0": <INT>, "A1": <INT>, ...}

In this decision-making game, we first analyze the original payoff structure and then incorporate the effects of the contract (the "twist").

1.  **Original Payoffs (Me, Other):**
    *   (A0, A0): (10, 10)
    *   (A0, A1): (0, 20)
    *   (A1, A0): (6, 2)
    *   (A1, A1): (4, 4)

2.  **Contract Adjustment:**
    *   The contract states that if a player chooses A0, they receive 11 points from the other player.
    *   If both choose A0: Both players receive 11 points and both players pay 11 points. The net adjustment is 0 for both.
    *   If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: I get +11 points and the other player gets -11 points.
    *   If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: I get -11 points and the other player gets +11 points.
    *   If both choose A1: There are no adjustments.

3.  **Modified Payoff Matrix (incorporating the contract):**
    *   (A0, A0): (10+11-11, 10+11-11) = **(10, 10)**
    *   (A0, A1): (0+11, 20-11) = **(11, 9)**
    *   (A1, A0): (6-11, 2+11) = **(-5, 13)**
    *   (A1, A1): (4, 4) = **(4, 4)**

4.  **Strategic Analysis for Player 1 (Me):**
    *   Against A0: Playing A0 yields 10 points, while playing A1 yields -5 points.
    *   Against A1: Playing A0 yields 11 points, while playing A1 yields 4 points.
    *   In both scenarios, A0 provides a significantly higher payoff. Therefore, A0 is the dominant strategy.

5.  **Strategic Analysis for Player 2 (The Other):**
    *   Against A0: Playing A0 yields 10 points, while playing A1 yields 9 points.
    *   Against A1: Playing A0 yields 13 points, while playing A1 yields 4 points.
    *   A0 is also the dominant strategy for Player 2.

Choosing A0 is the best possible decision for maximizing points, as it remains dominant regardless of the other player's actions.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

To maximize Player 2’s expected points, compare your payoffs for each possible action of Player 1:

- If Player 1 plays **A0**:  
  - You play **A0** → 10  
  - You play **A1** → 20 (better)

- If Player 1 plays **A1**:  
  - You play **A0** → 2  
  - You play **A1** → 4 (better)

So **A1 gives a higher payoff than A0 no matter what Player 1 does** (A1 strictly dominates A0). Therefore, you should play A1 with probability 100%.

To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the payoff matrix after incorporating the payment contract.

### Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### The Contract:
- If a player chooses **A0**, they receive **+11 points**, and these points are drawn from the other player.
- If a player chooses **A1**, there are no additional payments.

### Adjusted Payoff Matrix:
1.  **(A0, A0):** Both choose A0.
    - Player 1: $10 + 11 (\text{for playing A0}) - 11 (\text{because P2 played A0}) = 10$
    - Player 2: $10 + 11 (\text{for playing A0}) - 11 (\text{because P1 played A0}) = 10$
    - **Result: (10, 10)**
2.  **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1.
    - Player 1: $0 + 11 (\text{for playing A0}) = 11$
    - Player 2: $20 - 11 (\text{because P1 played A0}) = 9$
    - **Result: (11, 9)**
3.  **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0.
    - Player 1: $6 - 11 (\text{because P2 played A0}) = -5$
    - Player 2: $2 + 11 (\text{for playing A0}) = 13$
    - **Result: (-5, 13)**
4.  **(A1, A1):** Neither chooses A0.
    - Player 1: 4
    - Player 2: 4
    - **Result: (4, 4)**

### Strategic Analysis:
- **Player 1's Perspective:**
    - If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets **10** (A0) or **-5** (A1). A0 is better.
    - If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets **11** (A0) or **4** (A1). A0 is better.
    - **A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 1.**

- **Player 2's Perspective:**
    - If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets **10** (A0) or **9** (A1). A0 is better.
    - If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets **13** (A0) or **4** (A1). A0 is better.
    - **A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.**

Since A0 is the dominant strategy for both players, the Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0). By choosing A0 with 100% probability, Player 1 maximizes their expected points regardless of Player 2's decision.

To determine which contracts to approve, let's go step-by-step and calculate the expected points for each scenario with the addition of a contract. We will analyze the impact of each contract on the payoffs and decide whether to approve them.

### Basic Game Analysis Without Contracts:
- Both players choosing A0: (10, 10)
- Player 1 choosing A0, Player 2 choosing A1: (6, 2)
- Player 1 choosing A1, Player 2 choosing A0: (0, 20)
- Both players choosing A1: (4, 4)

### Analyzing Contracts:

#### Contract C1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other player.

This means the new payoffs are:
- Both players choosing A0:
  - Your payoff: \( 10 + 11 - 0 = 21 \)
  - Other player's payoff: \( 10 + 11 - 0 = 21 \)
- Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Your payoff: \( 2 - \frac{11}{2} = 2 - 5.5 = -3.5 \)
  - Other player's payoff: \( 6 + 11 - 5.5 = 11.5 \)
- Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Your payoff: \( 20 + \frac{11}{2} = 20 + 5.5 = 25.5 \)
  - Other player's payoff: \( 0 - 5.5 = -5.5 \)
- Both players choosing A1:
  - Your payoff: \( 4 \)
  - Other player's payoff: \( 4 \)

#### Contract C2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.

This means the new payoffs are:
- Both players choosing A0:
  - Your payoff: \( 10 + 5 - 0 = 15 \)
  - Other player's payoff: \( 10 + 5 - 0 = 15 \)
- Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Your payoff: \( 2 - \frac{5}{2} = 2 - 2.5 = -0.5 \)
  - Other player's payoff: \( 6 + 5 - 2.5 = 8.5 \)
- Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Your payoff: \( 20 + \frac{5}{2} = 20 + 2.5 = 22.5 \)
  - Other player's payoff: \( 0 - 2.5 = -2.5 \)
- Both players choosing A1:
  - Your payoff: \( 4 \)
  - Other player's payoff: \( 4 \)

### Analysis of Which Contracts to Approve:

#### Contract C1:
- Benefits you significantly for choosing A0 when both players choose A0 (maximizes joint gain).
- Significantly penalizes you when you choose A1 against Player 1's A0.
- Overall, this contract results in a relatively fair distribution but increases the propensity for choosing A0 for both players due to the high additional payoff.

#### Contract C2:
- Provides a moderate increase for mutual A0 choices.
- Doesn't heavily penalize choosing A1 compared to C1.
- Seems more balanced and encourages coordination.

Given this analysis, C2 seems preferable to C1 since it promotes mutual cooperation without excessively penalizing deviations or causing too large a disparity between the choices.

### Conclusion:

```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}
```

We should approve Contract C2 and not approve Contract C1.

To determine the optimal strategy, let’s first analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating the effects of the contract into the original payoffs.

**Original Payoffs (P1, P2):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Contract impact:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +11 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no change.

**Adjusted Payoffs with Contract:**
1.  **If P1: A0 and P2: A0:**
    *   P1 gets 10 (base) + 11 (from P2) - 11 (to P2) = 10
    *   P2 gets 10 (base) + 11 (from P1) - 11 (to P1) = 10
    *   **Result: (10, 10)**
2.  **If P1: A0 and P2: A1:**
    *   P1 gets 0 (base) + 11 (from P2) = 11
    *   P2 gets 20 (base) - 11 (to P1) = 9
    *   **Result: (11, 9)**
3.  **If P1: A1 and P2: A0:**
    *   P1 gets 6 (base) - 11 (to P2) = -5
    *   P2 gets 2 (base) + 11 (from P1) = 13
    *   **Result: (-5, 13)**
4.  **If P1: A1 and P2: A1:**
    *   P1 gets 4 (base) = 4
    *   P2 gets 4 (base) = 4
    *   **Result: (4, 4)**

**Strategic Analysis:**
*   **Player 1's Perspective:** If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 10 points with A0 versus -5 with A1. If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 11 points with A0 versus 4 with A1. In both scenarios, A0 is the better action. Thus, A0 is a **dominant strategy** for Player 1.
*   **Player 2's Perspective:** If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets 10 points with A0 versus 9 with A1. If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets 13 points with A0 versus 4 with A1. Thus, A0 is also a **dominant strategy** for Player 2.

In game theory, when both players have a dominant strategy, the rational equilibrium is for both players to play that strategy. Choosing A0 results in a higher individual payout for Player 1 regardless of Player 2’s decision, and it lead to a mutually beneficial outcome of (10, 10) compared to the alternative Nash equilibrium without the contract (4, 4).

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 12 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff structure while incorporating the effects of the payment contract. 

**1. Original Payoff Matrix (Player 2, Player 1):**
*   (A0, A0): You (P2) get 10, Other (P1) gets 10
*   (A1, A0): You (P2) get 20, Other (P1) gets 0
*   (A0, A1): You (P2) get 2, Other (P1) gets 6
*   (A1, A1): You (P2) get 4, Other (P1) gets 4

**2. Incorporating the Contract:**
The contract states:
*   If a player chooses A0, they receive +12 points, drawn from the other player (-12 for the other player).
*   If a player chooses A1, no additional payment occurs.

**3. Adjusted Payoff Matrix (Player 2, Player 1):**
*   **(P1: A0, P2: A0):** 
    P2: 10 + 12 (from P2: A0) - 12 (to P1: A0) = 10
    P1: 10 + 12 (from P1: A0) - 12 (to P2: A0) = 10
*   **(P1: A0, P2: A1):**
    P2: 20 - 12 (to P1: A0) = 8
    P1: 0 + 12 (from P1: A0) = 12
*   **(P1: A1, P2: A0):**
    P2: 2 + 12 (from P2: A0) = 14
    P1: 6 - 12 (to P2: A0) = -6
*   **(P1: A1, P2: A1):**
    P2: 4
    P1: 4

**4. Strategic Analysis:**
*   **Player 2's Strategy:** 
    - If Player 1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 from A0 and 8 from A1. (A0 is better)
    - If Player 1 plays A1, P2 gets 14 from A0 and 4 from A1. (A0 is better)
    Action A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.
*   **Player 1's Strategy:**
    - If Player 2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 from A0 and -6 from A1. (A0 is better)
    - If Player 2 plays A1, P1 gets 12 from A0 and 4 from A1. (A0 is better)
    Action A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 1.

Since A0 is the dominant strategy for both players, the Nash equilibrium of the game is (A0, A0), where both players receive 10 points. Choosing A0 maximizes the expected points regardless of the other player's decision.

To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and the impact of the payment contract. You are Player 2.

**Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1 choice, Player 2 choice):**
- (A0, A0): P1 = 10, P2 = 10
- (A0, A1): P1 = 0, P2 = 20
- (A1, A0): P1 = 6, P2 = 2
- (A1, A1): P1 = 4, P2 = 4

**The Payment Contract:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 11 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

**Adjusted Payoff Matrix (including the contract):**
- **(A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Both receive 11 and both give 11.
  - P1: 10 + 11 - 11 = 10
  - P2: 10 + 11 - 11 = 10
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 (receives 11), Player 2 chooses A1 (pays 11).
  - P1: 0 + 11 = 11
  - P2: 20 - 11 = 9
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1 (pays 11), Player 2 chooses A0 (receives 11).
  - P1: 6 - 11 = -5
  - P2: 2 + 11 = 13
- **(A1, A1):** No one chooses A0. No payments.
  - P1: 4
  - P2: 4

**Strategic Analysis:**
- **Player 1's Perspective:**
  - If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 10 (A0) or -5 (A1).
  - If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 11 (A0) or 4 (A1).
  - Choice A0 is Player 1's strictly dominant strategy.
- **Player 2's (Your) Perspective:**
  - If Player 1 plays A0, you get 10 (A0) or 9 (A1).
  - If Player 1 plays A1, you get 13 (A0) or 4 (A1).
  - Choice A0 is your strictly dominant strategy.

Both players have a dominant strategy to choose A0. This leads to a Nash equilibrium (A0, A0) where both players receive 10 points. Any deviation from A0 by either player would result in a lower individual payoff.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for this decision-making game, let’s analyze the payoffs systematically, incorporating the effects of the contract.

### 1. Re-calculate the Payoff Matrix
The original payoffs are modified by a contract: if a player chooses A0, they receive 12 points from the other player. Let $C_1 = 12$ if Player 1 (you) chooses A0 (else $0$), and $C_2 = 12$ if Player 2 chooses A0 (else $0$). The final payoffs are:
- **$F_1 = P_1 + C_1 - C_2$**
- **$F_2 = P_2 + C_2 - C_1$**

Applying this to each scenario:
*   **Both choose A0:**
    *   Initial: (10, 10). Contract: P1 gets +12-12=0, P2 gets +12-12=0.
    *   **Final: (10, 10)**
*   **P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1:**
    *   Initial: (0, 20). Contract: P1 gets +12-0=12, P2 gets 0-12=-12.
    *   **Final: (12, 8)**
*   **P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0:**
    *   Initial: (6, 2). Contract: P1 gets 0-12=-12, P2 gets +12-0=12.
    *   **Final: (-6, 14)**
*   **Both choose A1:**
    *   Initial: (4, 4). Contract: No payments.
    *   **Final: (4, 4)**

### 2. Identify Dominant Strategies
We analyze the modified matrix for incentives:
- **Player 1's Perspective:**
    - If P2 chooses A0: P1 gets **10** from A0, **-6** from A1. (A0 is better)
    - If P2 chooses A1: P1 gets **12** from A0, **4** from A1. (A0 is better)
    - **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1.**

- **Player 2's Perspective:**
    - If P1 chooses A0: P2 gets **10** from A0, **8** from A1. (A0 is better)
    - If P1 chooses A1: P2 gets **14** from A0, **4** from A1. (A0 is better)
    - **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2.**

### 3. Determine the Equilibrium
Since A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for both players, the rational outcome is for both to choose A0. In this case, both players earn 10 points. Deviating from A0 at any point would result in a lower expected payoff regardless of the other player's decision. Specifically for P1, the payoff for choosing A0 ($12 - 2q$, where $q$ is P2's probability of A0) is always higher than the payoff for A1 ($4 - 10q$) because $12 - 2q > 4 - 10q$ simplifies to $8 > -8q$, which is always true for any probability $q \in [0, 1]$.

### Final Strategy
The optimal strategy to maximize points is to assign 100% probability to action A0.

response:
To evaluate whether to sign the contract, we need to compare the outcomes of the game with and without the contract.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The original payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): P1 = 10, P2 = 10
- (A0, A1): P1 = 0, P2 = 20
- (A1, A0): P1 = 6, P2 = 2
- (A1, A1): P1 = 4, P2 = 4

In the original game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy. If P1 plays A0, P2 gets more from A1 (20) than A0 (10). If P1 plays A1, P2 gets more from A1 (4) than A0 (2). Thus, Player 2 will always play A1 ($q=0$). Knowing this, Player 1 will choose the action that maximizes their payoff when P2 plays A1. If P1 plays A0 they get 0, and if they play A1 they get 4. Thus, the Nash Equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Analysis of the Game with the Contract
The contract adds a payment of 11 points to any player who chooses A0, taken from the other player. No additional payment occurs for choosing A1.
- **(A0, A0):** P1 gets 10 + 11 (for A0) - 11 (to P2) = **10**; P2 gets 10 + 11 - 11 = **10**.
- **(A0, A1):** P1 gets 0 + 11 (for A0) = **11**; P2 gets 20 - 11 (to P1) = **9**.
- **(A1, A0):** P1 gets 6 - 11 (to P2) = **-5**; P2 gets 2 + 11 (for A0) = **13**.
- **(A1, A1):** P1 gets **4**; P2 gets **4**.

In this modified game:
- **Player 1's strategy:** If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs -5 (A1). If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 11 (A0) vs 4 (A1). A0 is now a dominant strategy for Player 1.
- **Player 2's strategy:** If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 9 (A1). If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 13 (A0) vs 4 (A1). A0 is now a dominant strategy for Player 2.

The Nash Equilibrium with the contract is **(A0, A0)**, which yields **10 points** for each player.

### 3. Comparison and Conclusion
- **Without Contract:** Player 1 receives **4 points**.
- **With Contract:** Player 1 receives **10 points**.

Since the contract changes the dominant strategy for both players, leading them from an equilibrium of 4 points to a mutually beneficial equilibrium of 10 points, it is in Player 1's best interest to sign the contract.

- (A0,A0): \(10 + 11 - 11 = 10\)
- (A0,A1): \(0 + 11 = 11\)
- (A1,A0): \(6 - 11 = -5\)
- (A1,A1): \(4\)

So, regardless of what Player 2 does, A0 gives me more than A1 (A0 strictly dominates).

**Contract C2 (A0 gets +12 from the other player):**
- (A0,A0): \(10 + 12 - 12 = 10\)
- (A0,A1): \(0 + 12 = 12\)
- (A1,A0): \(6 - 12 = -6\)
- (A1,A1): \(4\)

Again, A0 strictly dominates for me.

3) Check incentives for Player 2 as well: by symmetry of the transfer logic, A0 also becomes strictly dominant for Player 2 under both C1 and C2, so the unique outcome is (A0,A0).

4) Resulting payoff to me under either C1 or C2 is 10 for sure (unique dominant-strategy outcome), whereas without a contract the game is a coordination game that could land on the worse equilibrium (A1,A1) giving me 4.

Therefore I approve both contracts.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

===== Response [ID: 5a5c3ed0] [2026-01-24 03:07:30] =====

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 1, let's analyze the payoff matrix for the original game:

**Payoff Matrix (P1, P2):**
- (A0, A0): 10, 10
- (A0, A1): 0, 20
- (A1, A0): 6, 2
- (A1, A1): 4, 4

**Step 1: Determine Player 2's Dominant Strategy**
- If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 can choose A0 (10 points) or A1 (20 points). A1 is better.
- If Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 can choose A0 (2 points) or A1 (4 points). A1 is better.
In both scenarios, Player 2 receives a higher payoff by choosing A1. Thus, A1 is Player 2's strictly dominant strategy.

**Step 2: Determine Player 1's Best Response**
- If Player 2 is rational and chooses their dominant strategy (A1), Player 1's options are:
    - Choose A0: 0 points
    - Choose A1: 4 points
- To maximize points, Player 1's best response to A1 is A1.

**Step 3: Consider the Twist (Contract)**
Player 1 proposed a contract that would have balanced the incentives by making A0 a dominant strategy for both players, potentially leading to a (10, 10) outcome. However, Player 2 rejected it. This rejection suggests that Player 2 prefers the original matrix, likely because they aim for the highest possible payoff (20 points, which occurs if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1) or because they intend to stick to their dominant strategy (A1). In either case, Player 2 is highly unlikely to play A0.

**Step 4: Calculate Expected Values**
- Let $p$ be the probability that Player 2 chooses A0.
- Expected Value (EV) of A0 for P1: $10p + 0(1-p) = 10p$
- Expected Value (EV) of A1 for P1: $6p + 4(1-p) = 2p + 4$
- P1 should choose A0 only if $10p > 2p + 4$, which simplifies to $8p > 4$ or $p > 0.5$.
Since A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2 and they rejected a contract that would have encouraged A0, it is highly improbable that Player 2 will choose A0 (making $p$ much less than 0.5).

**Conclusion:**
The safest and most rational strategy for Player 1, especially given the rejection of the contract by Player 2, is to play A1 to ensure a payoff of 4 rather than risking a payoff of 0.

response:
Let’s analyze this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are Player 2 in this game (as stated: “you are playing in the position of Player 2”).

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|                | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

So, as **Player 2**, your payoffs are:

- If P1 chooses A0:
  - You choose A0 → 10
  - You choose A1 → 6
- If P1 chooses A1:
  - You choose A0 → 2
  - You choose A1 → 4

So your best response to P1 playing A0 is A0 (10 > 6), and to P1 playing A1 is A1 (4 > 2).

But since both players choose simultaneously, we look for Nash equilibria.

Let’s find the pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): Is it stable?
  - P1: If P2 plays A0, P1’s best response is A0 (10 vs 0) → yes
  - P2: If P1 plays A0, P2’s best response is A0 (10 vs 6) → yes
  → **(A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium**

- (A1, A1):
  - P1: If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4 if A1, 2 if A0 → so A1 is better → yes
  - P2: If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 4 if A1, 2 if A0 → so A1 is better → yes
  → **(A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium**

- (A0, A1):
  - P1: If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 2 (if A0) vs 4 (if A1) → so P1 prefers A1 → not stable

- (A1, A0):
  - P2: If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 2 (if A0) vs 4 (if A1) → so P2 prefers A1 → not stable

So two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Now, which one is more likely? That depends on coordination and incentives.

But now we bring in **contracts**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

A contract can be **approved via voting**. The contract with **maximum approvals** wins (selected uniformly at random among those with the max approvals).

You are Player 2, and you must decide which contracts to **approve**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Two Proposed Contracts**

#### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other player.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

Let’s break this down.

- If you play A0 → you gain **+11 points** from the contract.
- The cost of that 11 points is **shared equally** with the other player → so the other player **loses 5.5 points** (since 11 / 2 = 5.5) if you play A0.

But note: the contract applies to **both players**.

So:
- If **you** play A0 → you get +11, and the **other player** loses 5.5 (because you are taking 11 from them, split equally)
- If **other player** plays A0 → they get +11, **you** lose 5.5

Important: the contract says “drawn equally from the other player” — so when you choose A0, you get +11, and the other player is **forced to pay 11 in total**, split equally with you? Wait — this could be ambiguous.

But let’s read: “they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”

Key phrase: “drawn equally from the other players” → plural. But there is only one other player.

So the 11 points come **from the other player**, and are **shared equally** — that can’t be, unless it's split between multiple players.

But only two players.

Re-interpretation: Maybe it's written poorly. Likely, the meaning is:

> When a player chooses A0, they are paid 11 points, and the other player is **charged 11 points**.

But it says “drawn equally from the other players” — plural — which is odd. But since only one other player, probably means: **11 points are deducted from the other player**.

But then “equally” is confusing.

Alternative interpretation: Maybe “drawn equally from the other players” means that **each player who chooses A0 gets 11**, and this amount is **taken from the other player**, so the other player suffers a cost of 11 per A0 choice by the other.

But that doesn’t make sense because if both choose A0, each would receive +11, but each takes 11 from the other → total transfer = -11 (for each) → net, each loses 11? That breaks.

Wait — better interpretation:

> If you choose A0, you receive +11 from the contract, and **the other player is charged 11** (i.e., loses 11 points).

But the phrase “drawn equally from the other players” suggests that multiple players might be involved — but only two.

So likely, the intended meaning is: **the 11 points for choosing A0 are paid by the other player**.

So, for example:
- If you play A0, you get +11; the other player pays 11 → their total payoff goes down by 11.
- If the other player plays A0, they get +11; you pay 11 → your payoff goes down by 11.

But the contract says “drawn equally from the other players” — plural — but there is only one other player.

Most plausible explanation: the phrase is poorly worded, and it means: “the 11 points are taken from the other player.”

So, for **each player**, **if they choose A0**, they get +11, and **the other player loses 11**.

So net effect:
- A0 → +11 (to you), -11 (to opponent)
- A1 → no change

This seems to be the only interpretation that makes sense, despite the awkward phrasing.

So contract C1: **Each time a player plays A0, they gain 11, and the opponent loses 11**.

So it's a **transfer from opponent to you** when you play A0.

Important: this transfer happens **regardless of what the opponent does**.

So if you play A0 and they play A1, you get +11 from contract, and they lose 11.

Similarly, if both play A0 → you get +11, they get +11 → but wait, they also got +11 from their A0, but you caused them to lose 11? Contradiction.

Wait — **this is the issue**.

If **you** play A0 → **you gain +11**, and **they lose 11**

If **they** play A0 → **they gain +11**, and **you lose 11**

So if **both** play A0:
- You gain +11 (from your A0)
- But you lose 11 (because they played A0)
→ net: 0 from contract
- Same for other player

So the net contract effect cancels out.

If both play A0 → contract total: 0 for each.

If only you play A0 → you gain +11, opponent loses 11

If only they play A0 → you lose 11, opponent gains +11

If both play A1 → no effect

So the contract **only affects** if one plays A0 and the other doesn't.

Now, let's compute **net payoffs under contract C1**, combining with base payoffs.

We compute the **total expected payoff** for **you** (Player 2) under C1.

We do this for each outcome.

---

### **Step 4: Compute Total Payoffs Under C1 (for Player 2)**

| P1 | P2 | Base Payoff (P2) | Contract Adjustment (P2) | Total Payoff (P2) |
|----|----|-------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| A0 | A0 | 10                | -11 (because P1 plays A0)  | 10 - 11 = **-1**   |
| A0 | A1 | 6                 | 0 (you didn't play A0)     | 6                  |
| A1 | A0 | 2                 | +11 (you played A0)        | 2 + 11 = **13**    |
| A1 | A1 | 4                 | 0                          | 4                  |

Let’s double-check:

- (A0,A0): P1 played A0 → you (P2) lose 11 → so your total: 10 (base) - 11 (contract penalty) = -1 → correct
- (A0,A1): You played A1 → no +11 → P1 played A0 → you lose 11 → wait, no!

Wait — **Big mistake here.**

The contract says: **if YOU choose A0, you get +11, and the other player loses 11**

But if **you play A1**, **you do NOT get +11**, and **you are NOT penalized**.

But if the **other player plays A0**, then **they get +11**, and **you lose 11**.

So the contract affects you **only** if **they play A0** → you lose 11.

Similarly, you gain 11 **only** if **you play A0**.

So correct:

- (A0,A0): → you play A0 → +11; P1 plays A0 → you lose 11 → net: +11 - 11 = 0 → base payoff 10 → total: **10**
- Wait! That contradicts above.

No: the contract is **per player**.

- When **you** play A0 → you get +11
- When **P1** plays A0 → **you** lose 11

So in (A0, A0):
- You (P2) played A0 → you gain +11
- P1 played A0 → you lose -11
→ net contract: +11 -11 = 0
→ total payoff: 10 (base) + 0 = **10**

Similarly, (A0, A1):
- You played A1 → no gain from contract
- P1 played A0 → you lose 11
→ so net contract: -11
- Base payoff: 6 → total: 6 - 11 = **-5**

(A1, A0):
- You played A0 → +11
- P1 played A1 → no penalty to you
→ contract: +11
- Base: 2 → total: 2 + 11 = **13**

(A1, A1):
- You played A1 → no gain
- P1 played A1 → no loss
→ contract: 0
- Base: 4 → total: 4

Let’s update the table:

| P1 | P2 | Base (P2) | Contract (P2) | Total (P2) |
|----|----|-----------|---------------|------------|
| A0 | A0 | 10        | +11 (A0) -11 (P1 A0) = 0 | **10** |
| A0 | A1 | 6         | 0 (you A1) -11 (P1 A0) = -11 | **-5** |
| A1 | A0 | 2         | +11 (you A0) -0 (P1 A1) = +11 | **13** |
| A1 | A1 | 4         | 0 | **4** |

So under C1, your total payoffs are:

- (A0,A0): 10
- (A0,A1): -5
- (A1,A0): 13
- (A1,A1): 4

Now, what about **Player 1’s** incentives?

We must consider: would the other player (P1) be likely to play certain actions under this contract?

But remember: we are deciding whether to **approve** C1.

We want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

But since the final contract is chosen at random from those with **maximum approvals**, we need to think about **strategic approval**.

We must decide: **Do we want C1 to pass?** Or not?

But we need to analyze what **happens if C1 is approved**.

But approval affects whether it wins.

---

### **Step 5: Strategic Consideration — What Do We Want?**

We are Player 2. We want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

But the **final contract is selected randomly from those with the maximum approval count**.

So if we approve a contract, and it gets high approval, it might win.

But we get **only the payoff under the winning contract**.

So we must **evaluate whether, if C1 wins, do we benefit?** Similarly for C2.

We need to **compare the payoffs** under each contract, assuming rational play.

But **both players choose probabilities simultaneously**, so we need to find **equilibria** under each contract.

Let’s do that.

---

### **Step 6: Analyze C1: Equilibrium Under the Contract**

Under C1, your **total payoffs** are:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------|----|----|
| A0      | 10 | -5 |
| A1      | 13 | 4 |

Now, find best responses.

From your perspective (Player 2):

- If P1 plays A0: you compare 10 (A0) vs -5 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: you compare 13 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is a dominant strategy for you** under C1.

So no matter what P1 does, you prefer A0.

Now, check Player 1's incentives:

P1's payoffs under C1:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------|----|----|
| A0      | 10 (base) -11 (P2 A0) = -1 | 20 (base) -11 (P2 A0) = 9 |
| A1      | 0 (base) -11 (P2 A0) = -11 | 4 (base) = 4 |

Wait — let's compute P1’s total payoff under C1.

P1’s base payoffs (from matrix):

- (A0,A0): 10
- (A0,A1): 20
- (A1,A0): 0
- (A1,A1): 4

But contract adjustments:

- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gains +11
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 loses 11

So P1’s total payoff:

- (A0,A0): base 10, +11 (P1 played A0), -11 (P2 played A0) → 10 +11 -11 = **10**
- (A0,A1): base 20, +11 (P1 A0), no penalty (P2 A1) → 20 +11 = **31**
- (A1,A0): base 0, no +11 (P1 A1), -11 (P2 A0) → 0 -11 = **-11**
- (A1,A1): base 4, no +11, no penalty → **4**

So P1’s payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0    | A1   |
|---------|-------|------|
| A0      | 10    | 31   |
| A1      | -11   | 4    |

Now, P1’s best responses:

- If P2 plays A0: P1 compares 10 (A0) vs -11 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 compares 31 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is also dominant for P1 under C1**.

So in equilibrium, both will play **A0** → outcome: (A0,A0)

Your payoff: **10** (from earlier)

So under C1, **equilibrium is (A0,A0)**, your total payoff is **10**

But originally, without contract, (A0,A0) gives you 10, so **no change in payoff**.

But now: could there be a better outcome?

In equilibrium, yes — it’s (A0,A0), payoff 10.

But is there a way to get more than 10?

In the C1 world, if you could get P1 to play A1 while you play A0 — but P1 gets 10 vs -11, so will never play A1.

So **only equilibrium is (A0,A0)**, you get 10.

Compare to **original game**: (A0,A0) gives 10, (A1,A1) gives 4.

So **you’re fine**.

But we need to think: **Do you want C1 to pass?**

Well, **you’d get 10 under C1**, same as the (A0,A0) equilibrium in original game.

But under original game, the other Nash equilibrium is (A1,A1) with payoff 4 — worse for you.

But (A0,A0) is stable.

Now, **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

So **no effect** — this contract does nothing.

So if C2 is selected, it’s the same as the original game.

So payoffs are unchanged.

Now, the **key question is: what do you want?**

We are to **maximize our total points**.

So we want the **contract that leads to the highest expected payoff for us**, assuming rational play.

But note: **the winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.**

So we must decide: **which contracts do we approve, to maximize our chance of getting a good outcome?**

We can't force a contract — we can only vote.

We must think strategically: **Which contracts will get approval?**

We know what we want.

Let’s evaluate:

---

### **Step 7: Evaluate Contracts from Your Perspective (Player 2)**

#### **C1 (Player 1's proposal):**

- You get **10 points** in equilibrium.
- Same as original (A0,A0) equilibrium.
- But is **C1 better** than original game? In some cases, maybe — but not for you.
- However, **C1 might incentivize both to play A0** — which is good for you.
- But **in original game**, (A0,A0) is a stable equilibrium, so you’d likely get 10 anyway.
- **But what if they play (A1,A1)?** You get only 4.
- So C1 **ensures** (A0,A0) is the only equilibrium → you get 10 for sure.

In original game, if players coordinate on (A1,A1), you get 4 — bad.

But with C1, even if both are selfish, they both want A0 → so (A0,A0) is enforced.

So **C1 guarantees you 10 points**, while in origin game, you could get only 4.

So **C1 is better for you**.

But wait: is that true? In the original game, if no coordination, do players play (A0,A0)?

Let’s see: is (A0,A0) the only stable outcome?

No — (A1,A1) is also Nash.

So depending on beliefs, you might get 10 or 4.

But in a game with two equilibria, it's uncertain.

However, in **C1**, the **only Nash equilibrium** is (A0,A0) — because A0 is dominant.

So **you are guaranteed 10**.

In original game, you might get 10 or 4.

So **C1 is better for you** — it eliminates the bad equilibrium.

So you should **approve C1**.

But what about **C2**?

C2 is **useless** — it does nothing.

So if C2 passes, game is original — you could get 10 or 4.

So **C2 is worse than C1** — because C1 guarantees you 10.

So **you should not approve C2** — since it gives you a worse (or same) outcome.

Wait — but you might want to approve C2 if **Player 1** approves C1, but you're not sure.

But we are deciding based on **what maximizes your expected payoff**.

But we are only voting — not knowing others’ votes.

But we are to **maximize our expected payoff**, so we should approve contracts that **help us**.

So:

- **Approve C1**: because it guarantees you 10, while original game might give you 4.
- **Do not approve C2**: because it’s worse than C1, and you can do better.

But is **C2** the only alternative?

Yes.

But here’s a twist: **Player 1 proposed C1**, so maybe Player 1 will approve only C1.

If **Player 1 approves C1** and **you approve C1**, then C1 has 2 approvals.

If you **don’t approve C2**, and Player 1 doesn’t either, then C2 has 0.

But the winner is chosen from **maximum approval** — so if C1 gets 2, it wins.

But what if **Player 1 doesn’t approve C1**? But it’s their own proposal — they almost certainly approve it.

Similarly, **Player 2 (you)**: you are asked to approve.

So likely, **Player 1 will approve C1**, you may or may not.

But to maximize your outcome, you should **approve C1**.

**Why?** Because if C1 passes, you get **10**.

If C2 passes, you get **at best 10**, at worst 4.

So **C1 is strictly better** for you, assuming rational play.

Therefore, **you should approve C1**.

But what about the **other player**? Do they want the same?

Player 1 might **want C1**, but let’s check.

For **Player 1**, under C1:
- In equilibrium: (A0,A0), payoff = 10
- In original game: (A0,A0) also gives 10 — same
- But in original, (A1,A1) gives 4 — worse
- But under C1, **A0 is dominant** — so P1 gets 10 for sure
- In original, P1 could get 10 or 4 — depends on coordination
- So **Player 1 also benefits** from C1 — it guarantees them 10

So Player 1 **will want C1**.

So likely, **both players approve C1**.

C2 gets 0 approvals.

So C1 wins.

You get **10 points**.

Now, if you **don’t approve C1**, but **approve C2**, then:
- C1: 1 approval (P1 only)
- C2: 2 approvals (P1 and you)
→ maximum approval is 2 → C2 wins → original game

Then you might get 10 or 4 → expected value **less than 10**, since 4 is possible.

So **by approving C2, you risk getting only 4**.

By **approving C1**, you **lock in 10**.

Therefore, **you should approve C1 and not approve C2**.

But wait — is there a possibility of **coordination**?

No — the contract choice is random from maximum approval.

So if you approve C1 and C2, and P1 approves C1, then:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 1 approval
→ C1 wins → you get 10

But if you approve C2 and not C1, then:
- C1: 1
- C2: 2
→ C2 wins → you might get 4

So better to approve C1.

But what if **Player 1 doesn’t approve C1**? But they proposed it — unlikely.

Even if they do, you still do better with C1.

So **optimal strategy: approve C1, disapprove C2.**

But let’s confirm the payoffs again.

Under C1: you get 10 in equilibrium.

Under C2: same as original, you might get 10 or 4.

So expected payoff under C2 could be less than 10.

So you prefer C1.

Therefore, **approve C1**, **disapprove C2**.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

**Original Payoff Matrix (My payoff, Other's payoff):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (2, 6)  
- (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**My incentives:**
- If Other plays A0: I get 10 from A0 vs 20 from A1 → I prefer A1
- If Other plays A1: I get 2 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → I prefer A1
- **A1 is my dominant strategy**

**Other player's incentives:**
- If I play A0: Other gets 10 from A0 vs 6 from A1 → prefers A0
- If I play A1: Other gets 0 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefers A1

**Nash Equilibrium without contract:** (A1, A1) with payoffs **(4, 4)**

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds: +11 points for choosing A0 (paid by the other player), 0 for A1.

**New Payoff Matrix:**
- (A0, A0): (10+11-11, 10+11-11) = (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (2+11, 6-11) = (13, -5)
- (A1, A0): (20-11, 0+11) = (9, 11)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**My incentives:**
- If Other plays A0: I get 10 from A0 vs 9 from A1 → I prefer A0
- If Other plays A1: I get 13 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → I prefer A0
- **A0 is now my dominant strategy!**

**Other player's incentives:**
- If I play A0: Other gets 10 from A0 vs -5 from A1 → prefers A0
- If I play A1: Other gets 11 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefers A0
- **A0 is now Other's dominant strategy!**

**Nash Equilibrium with contract:** (A0, A0) with payoffs **(10, 10)**

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** I get 4 points
- **With contract:** I get 10 points

The contract transforms the game so that both players have A0 as a dominant strategy, achieving the mutually beneficial (10, 10) outcome instead of the suboptimal (4, 4) Nash equilibrium of the original game.

This is a win-win situation. I should definitely sign.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the game step by step. 

### Step 1: Understanding Payoffs without the Contract

First, let’s summarize the payoffs without the contract for each pair of actions:
- If both players choose A0: Both get 10 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other gets 0 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other gets 6 points.
- If both choose A1: Both get 4 points.

### Step 2: Understanding Payoffs with the Contract

Under the contract:
- Choosing A0 grants an additional 11 points from the other player.
- Choosing A1 remains unchanged.

This changes the payoffs as follows:
- If both players choose A0:
  - Player 1: 10 (base) - 11 (payment) = -1 points.
  - Player 2 (you): 10 (base) + 11 (payment) = 21 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 0 (base) - 11 (payment) = -11 points.
  - Player 2 (you): 20 (base) + 0 (payment) = 20 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 6 (base) + 0 (payment) = 6 points.
  - Player 2 (you): 2 (base) - 11 (payment) = -9 points.
- If both choose A1: Both still get 4 points each.

### Step 3: Analyzing the Incentives

Consider your potential actions:
- If both players choose A0, you stand to gain the most (21 points to Player 1's -1 point). However, it is highly unlikely the rational Player 1 will choose A0 given their significant negative payoff.
- If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0, you receive 20 points to Player 1's -11 points. Given Player 1's negative impact, they will likely avoid this.
- If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1, you receive -9 points while Player 1 gets 6 points which is not favorable for you.
- If both choose A1, you both get 4 points, same as without the contract, yet you avoid the significant penalties.

### Conclusion

Signing the contract disproportionately benefits you under very specific scenarios where Player 1 is significantly penalized. Therefore, it is highly likely Player 1 would avoid signing such a contract. Additionally, under rational play and considering common utility maximization, the default scenario (not signing the contract) seems more stable.

### Final Decision

Based on this analysis, signing the contract appears not compulsory for maximizing overall outcomes, considering that rational behavior from Player 1 would lead likely to non-signing.

Let's carefully analyze the game step by step, incorporating both the base payoff structure and the **payment contract** that affects final payoffs.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base payoff (before contract)**

We are in the role of **Player 2**, and the other player is **Player 1**.

The base payoffs (as given):

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Payoff | Other Player's Payoff |
|------------|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0         | A0                    | 10          | 10                     |

| A0         | A1                    | 2           | 6                      |
| A1         | A1                    | 4           | 4                      |

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

> **Contract (approved by Player 1):**
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 11 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, **no additional payments** in either direction.

So:
- If **you** (Player 2) choose **A0**, you get **+11** points, and **Player 1 loses 11**.
- If **Player 1** chooses **A0**, they get **+11**, and **you lose 11**.
- If **you** choose **A1**, **no change**.
- If **Player 1** chooses **A1**, **no change**.

So the **final payoff** is:
> **Base payoff + (your A0 bonus - other player's A0 penalty)**

But since the bonus is **drawn from the other player**, we can represent the **net effect** as:

- If you choose A0 → you gain +11, opponent loses 11
- If opponent chooses A0 → opponent gains +11, you lose 11

Thus, the **total payoff for you (Player 2)** becomes:
> Base payoff + 11×(1 if you choose A0) – 11×(1 if opponent chooses A0)

Similarly, for the opponent (Player 1):
> Base payoff + 11×(1 if they choose A0) – 11×(1 if you choose A0)

But we only care about **our own payoff** for strategy choice.

---

### **Step 3: Write the total payoff for Player 2 (you)**

Let:
- $ p $ = your probability of choosing A0 (what we are choosing)
- $ q $ = opponent’s probability of choosing A0

Then your **expected payoff** is:

$$
E[\text{Your Payoff}] = \sum_{\text{outcomes}} P(\text{outcome}) \times \text{Net Payoff}
$$

We compute each case:

---

#### Case 1: You A0, Opponent A0
- Base: 10
- You choose A0 → +11
- Opponent chooses A0 → you lose 11
- Net: 10 + 11 – 11 = **10**
- Probability: $ p \cdot q $

---

#### Case 2: You A1, Opponent A0
- Base: 20
- You choose A1 → no bonus
- Opponent chooses A0 → you lose 11
- Net: 20 – 11 = **9**
- Probability: $ (1-p) \cdot q $

---

#### Case 3: You A0, Opponent A1
- Base: 2
- You choose A0 → +11
- Opponent chooses A1 → no deduction
- Net: 2 + 11 = **13**
- Probability: $ p \cdot (1-q) $

---

#### Case 4: You A1, Opponent A1
- Base: 4
- You choose A1 → no bonus
- Opponent chooses A1 → no deduction
- Net: 4
- Probability: $ (1-p) \cdot (1-q) $

---

Now compute expected payoff for you:

$$
E[\text{You}] = p q \cdot 10 + (1-p) q \cdot 9 + p (1-q) \cdot 13 + (1-p)(1-q) \cdot 4
$$

Let’s expand this expression:

$$
= 10pq + 9q(1-p) + 13p(1-q) + 4(1-p)(1-q)
$$

Expand each term:
- $ 10pq $
- $ 9q - 9pq $
- $ 13p - 13pq $
- $ 4(1 - p - q + pq) = 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq $

Add them all:

$$
= 10pq + 9q - 9pq + 13p - 13pq + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq
$$

Group like terms:

- **pq terms**: $10 - 9 -13 + 4 = -8pq$
- **p terms**: $13p - 4p = 9p$
- **q terms**: $9q - 4q = 5q$
- **constant**: 4

So:

$$
E[\text{You}] = -8pq + 9p + 5q + 4
$$

We want to **maximize this expected payoff**, by choosing $ p \in [0,1] $, **assuming the opponent chooses some $ q $** (but we don't know $ q $).

However, since both players choose **simultaneously**, and we are trying to be optimal, we might assume a **Nash equilibrium** approach, i.e., find a **best response** to the opponent’s strategy.

But note: **the opponent is Player 1**, and they **proposed the contract**. They might be strategic. But we are not told their goal, only that they chose this contract.

But since we are trying to **maximize our own payoff**, and **the contract is fixed**, we can assume that **Player 1 is also rational**, and will choose $ q $ optimally **given the contract**.

So we should consider the **Nash equilibrium** under this contract.

---

### **Step 4: Find Nash Equilibrium (Mutual Best Responses)**

We are Player 2 (you), and we need to find optimal $ p $, assuming Player 1 chooses optimal $ q $.

Let’s derive **Player 1’s expected payoff**.

#### Player 1's payoff:

Same logic:

- If Player 1 chooses A0 → +11
- If you (Player 2) choose A0 → Player 1 loses 11
- So net bonus: +11 if Player 1 chooses A0, –11 if you choose A0

So Player 1’s expected payoff:

$$
E[\text{Player 1}] = \text{base payoff} + 11 \cdot (\text{if they choose A0}) - 11 \cdot (\text{if you choose A0})
$$

Again, case by case:

| Player 1 | You | Base Payoff | P1 Bonus | You Bonus? | P1 Net |
|---------|-----|--------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| A0      | A0  | 10           | +11      | Yes (you A0 → P1 loses 11) | 10 + 11 – 11 = 10 |
| A0      | A1  | 6            | +11      | No (you A1 → no loss to P1) | 6 + 11 = 17 |
| A1      | A0  | 0            | 0        | Yes (you A0 → P1 loses 11) | 0 – 11 = -11 |
| A1      | A1  | 4            | 0        | No (you A1) | 4 |

So:

$$
E[\text{P1}] = q \cdot p \cdot 10 + q \cdot (1-p) \cdot 17 + (1-q) \cdot p \cdot (-11) + (1-q) \cdot (1-p) \cdot 4
$$

Simplify:

- $ 10pq $
- $ 17q(1-p) = 17q - 17pq $
- $ -11p(1-q) = -11p + 11pq $
- $ 4(1-p)(1-q) = 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq $

Add:

- pq: 10 - 17 + 11 + 4 = 8pq
- p: -11p
- q: 17q - 4q = 13q
- const: 4

So:

$$
E[\text{P1}] = 8pq -11p + 13q + 4
$$

---

### **Step 5: Find best responses**

We want to find $ p $ and $ q $ such that:

- $ p $ is best response to $ q $
- $ q $ is best response to $ p $

---

#### **Player 2's best response to $ q $**:

Recall our expected payoff:
$$
E_2 = -8pq + 9p + 5q + 4
$$

We can rewrite as:
$$
E_2 = p(-8q + 9) + (5q + 4)
$$

So:
- If $ -8q + 9 > 0 $ → increase $ p $
- If $ -8q + 9 < 0 $ → decrease $ p $
- If $ = 0 $ → indifferent

So:
- $ -8q + 9 > 0 $ → $ q < 9/8 = 1.125 $ → Always true since $ q \leq 1 $
- So $ -8q + 9 \geq 1 $ (since $ q=1 $: $ -8 + 9 = 1 $)

So coefficient of $ p $ is **always ≥ 1** for $ q \in [0,1] $

Thus, **$ p = 1 $** is always better than $ p = 0 $

Wait: check at $ q = 1 $: coefficient = -8(1) + 9 = 1 > 0 → yes, increasing in p → best to set $ p = 1 $

At $ q = 0 $: coefficient = 9 → still positive → p = 1 best

So **Player 2 always maximizes payoff by choosing A1 with probability 1** → $ p = 1 $

So **best response for Player 2 is always p = 1**, no matter what q is.

---

#### **Player 1's best response to $ p $**:

From: $ E_1 = 8pq -11p + 13q + 4 $

Rewriting:

$$
E_1 = q(8p + 13) + (-11p + 4)
$$

So coefficient of $ q $: $ 8p + 13 $

Since $ p \in [0,1] $, $ 8p + 13 \in [13, 21] $, always **positive**

So $ E_1 $ increases in $ q $ → best to set $ q = 1 $

So **Player 1’s best response is always q = 1**, regardless of $ p $

---

### **Conclusion: Nash Equilibrium**

- Player 2 best response: $ p = 1 $
- Player 1 best response: $ q = 1 $

So **(p=1, q=1)** is the **only Nash equilibrium**.

That means both players choose A1 with probability 1.

---

### **Step 6: Verify payoff at (p=1, q=1)**

You choose A1, opponent chooses A1.

- Base payoff: 4
- You: A1 → no +11
- Opponent: A1 → no +11, so no loss for you
- **Your total payoff: 4**

But let’s double-check with our earlier formula:

$$
E[\text{You}] = -8pq + 9p + 5q + 4
$$
At $ p=1, q=1 $: $ -8 + 9 + 5 + 4 = 10 $ → ??? Wait, inconsistency!

Wait, something is wrong.

Wait — we had:

$$
E[\text{You}] = -8pq + 9p + 5q + 4
$$

Plug $ p=1, q=1 $: $ -8(1)(1) + 9(1) + 5(1) + 4 = -8 + 9 + 5 + 4 = 10 $

But earlier we said that in case you A1, opponent A1: base = 4, no bonus → so payoff = 4

But here we get 10?

There is a **mistake** in derivation.

Let’s go back.

---

### **Recompute your expected payoff carefully**

We had:

#### Case 1: You A0, Opp A0
- Base: 10
- You A0 → +11
- Opp A0 → you lose 11
- Net: 10 + 11 – 11 = **10**
- Prob: $ pq $

#### Case 2: You A1, Opp A0
- Base: 20
- You A1 → no bonus
- Opp A0 → you lose 11
- Net: 20 – 11 = **9**
- Prob: $ (1-p) q $

#### Case 3: You A0, Opp A1
- Base: 2
- You A0 → +11
- Opp A1 → no penalty
- Net: 2 + 11 = **13**
- Prob: $ p(1-q) $

#### Case 4: You A1, Opp A1
- Base: 4
- You A1 → no bonus
- Opp A1 → no penalty
- Net: 4
- Prob: $ (1-p)(1-q) $

So:

$$
E[\text{You}] = pq \cdot 10 + (1-p)q \cdot 9 + p(1-q) \cdot 13 + (1-p)(1-q) \cdot 4
$$

Now expand:
- $ 10pq $
- $ 9q(1-p) = 9q - 9pq $
- $ 13p(1-q) = 13p - 13pq $
- $ 4(1-p)(1-q) = 4(1 - p - q + pq) = 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq $

Now sum:
- pq terms: 10pq -9pq -13pq +4pq = (10 -9 -13 +4)pq = (-8)pq
- p terms: 13p - 4p = 9p
- q terms: 9q - 4q = 5q
- constant: 4

So: $ E = -8pq + 9p + 5q + 4 $

Now plug $ p=1, q=1 $:

- $ -8(1)(1) + 9(1) + 5(1) + 4 = -8 + 9 + 5 + 4 = 10 $

But **actual case** at (A1, A1): you get 4

So why does calculation say 10?

Ah! Because when $ p=1, q=1 $, only case 1 happens: you A0, opp A0

But in reality, we set $ p=1 $ → you choose A1 with probability 1 → $ p=1 $ → you **never** choose A0

So **case 1 does not occur** — but in the formula, we are mixing cases.

Wait! **No** — the formula only uses **probabilities**, so it's correct.

But at $ p=1 $, $ q=1 $, the only outcome is (A1, A1), which has **prob = (1-p)(1-q) = 0**, so no issue.

Wait: $ p=1 $ → you choose A0 with prob 1 → so you choose A0, not A1!

**Ah! Here's the critical error.**

- If $ p = $ probability of choosing A0
- So $ p=1 $ → you **always choose A0**
- But earlier I claimed best response is $ p=1 $, meaning choose A0 with 100% probability

But **in the payoff case analysis**, I said:

- At $ p=1, q=1 $: both choose A0 → you get 10 (from 10 +11 –11 =10), which matches

But now, my **earlier mistake** was in claiming that best response is $ p=1 $, but **if you choose A0**, you get +11 if you do, but you lose 11 if opponent chooses A0.

In the formula, we said coefficient of $ p $ is $ -8q + 9 $

Let’s analyze this:

$$
E[\text{You}] = p(-8q + 9) + (5q + 4)
$$

So:
- If $ -8q + 9 > 0 $ → best to set $ p=1 $
- If $ < 0 $ → set $ p=0 $
- If = 0 → indifferent

Now, $ -8q + 9 > 0 $ → $ q < 9/8 $, always true → so $ -8q + 9 \geq 1 $ for $ q \leq 1 $

So **for any q**, the coefficient is positive → so $ p=1 $ is best

So you should choose A0 with 100% probability, **regardless of q**

But if you choose A0 with 100%, and opponent chooses A0 with probability $ q $, then:

- You get 10 if opp A0 (prob q)
- You get 13 if opp A1 (prob 1−q)

So expected payoff: $ 10q + 13(1−q) = 13 − 3q $

This is maximized when $ q=0 $ → 13

But if $ q=1 $, payoff = 10

But is this **really optimal**?

Wait — but what if you choose A1?

Then you get:

- If opp A0: base 20, minus 11 (because opp chose A0) → 9
- If opp A1: base 4 → 4
- So expected: $ 9q + 4(1−q) = 4 + 5q $

Now compare:
- If you choose A0: payoff = $ 10q + 13(1−q) = 13 − 3q $
- If you choose A1: payoff = $ 4 + 5q $

Set them equal to find indifference:

$ 13 − 3q = 4 + 5q $

$ 13 − 4 = 5q + 3q $

$ 9 = 8q $

$ q = 9/8 = 1.125 > 1 $ → impossible

So for all $ q \in [0,1] $, $ 13 − 3q > 4 + 5q $?

Check at $ q=1 $:

- A0: 13 − 3 = 10
- A1: 4 + 5 = 9 → A0 better

At $ q=0 $:

- A0: 13
- A1: 4 → A0 better

At $ q=0.5 $:

- A0: 13 − 1.5 = 11.5
- A1: 4 + 2.5 = 6.5 → still A0 better

So yes, **A0 dominates A1 for Player 2**, **no matter what the opponent does**

So **Player 2’s best strategy is to always choose A0**

So $ p = 100\% $

Now, what about Player 1?

Player 1 wants to maximize their own expected payoff:

$$
E_1 = 8pq -11p + 13q + 4
$$

With $ p = 1 $ (since you always choose A0)

So plug $ p = 1 $:

$$
E_1 = 8q -11(1) + 13q + 4 = (8q + 13q) + (-11 + 4) = 21q -7
$$

This is increasing in $ q $

So Player 1 maximizes by choosing $ q = 1 $

So if you set $ p=1 $, Player 1 sets $ q=1 $

Result: both choose A0

Your payoff:
- Base: 10
- You choose A0 → +11
- Opponent chooses A0 → you lose 11
- Net: 10 + 11 – 11 = **10**

But wait — earlier we said in case both A0: base 10, you get 10 → yes.

Is there an alternative?

Could Player 1 do better by choosing $ q=0 $? Then $ E_1 = 21(0) -7 = -7 $, worse than $ q=1 $: $ 21 -7 = 14 $

At $ q=1 $: Player 1's payoff = ?

From earlier:

- Both A0: base = 10
- Player 1 chooses A0 → +11
- You choose A0 → Player 1 loses 11
- Net: 10 +11 –11 = 10

Yes: payoff = 10

Wait — but according to formula $ E_1 = 21q -7 $, at $ q=1 $: 14? Contradiction.

Where's the error?

Go back to Player 1’s payoff calculation.

Earlier, we had:

- Case 1: P1 A0, you A0 → base 10 +11 (P1 chooses A0) –11 (you chose A0) = 10
- Case 2: P1 A0, you A1 → base 6 +11 = 17
- Case 3: P1 A1, you A0 → base 0 –11 = -11
- Case 4: P1 A1, you A1 → base 4

So:
$$
E_1 = pq \cdot 10 + (1-p)q \cdot 17 + p(1-q) \cdot (-11) + (1-p)(1-q) \cdot 4
$$

Now plug $ p=1 $:

$$
= 1 \cdot q \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 17 + 1 \cdot (1-q) \cdot (-11) + 0 \cdot 4
= 10q -11(1-q) = 10q -11 + 11q = 21q -11
$$

Ah! I had a mistake earlier.

I wrote: $ E_1 = 8pq -11p + 13q + 4 $, but the constant was wrong.

Correct expansion:

From:
- $ 10pq $
- $ 17q(1-p) $
- $ -11p(1-q) $
- $ 4(1-p)(1-q) $

Now:
- $ 17q(1-p) = 17q -17pq $
- $ -11p(1-q) = -11p + 11pq $
- $ 4(1-p)(1-q) = 4 -4p -4q +4pq $

Sum:

- pq: 10pq -17pq +11pq +4pq = (10 -17 +11 +4)pq = 8pq
- p: -11p -4p = -15p
- q: 17q -4q = 13q
- const: 4

So: $ E_1 = 8pq -15p + 13q + 4 $

Now plug $ p=1 $: $ 8q -15 + 13q + 4 = 21q -11 $ → matches manual

So correct: $ E_1 = 8pq -15p + 13q + 4 $

Now back to Player 2: our formula is correct: $ E_2 = -8pq + 9p + 5q + 4 $

Now, since $ p=1 $ is optimal for Player 2 (always, because A0 beats A1 regardless of q), and Player 1, knowing this, chooses q=1 to maximize $ 21q -11 $ → so q=1

So equilibrium: $ p=1 $, $ q=1 $ → both choose A0

Payoff for you: 10

Is there a better response?

Suppose you consider choosing A1 (p=0)

Then expected payoff:
- If q=1: you get base 20, minus 11 → 9
- If q<1: better
But you don't control q

Player 1 will set q=1 if they know you are playing A1? Not necessarily

But in equilibrium, since your best response is p=1, and Player 1’s best response to p=1 is q=1, it’s stable

If you deviate to p=0, then you get:

$ E_2 = -8(0)q + 9(0) + 5q + 4 = 5q + 4 $

At q=1 → 9

But if you play p=1 and q=1 → you get 10 → better than 9

So no incentive to deviate

Therefore, **best strategy for you is to set A0 with 100% probability**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

You should choose A0 with probability 100%, A1 with 0%.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

We are Player 2. The game matrix is as follows (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | Player 1 A0 | Player 1 A1 |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Player 2 A0** | (10, 10)    | (2, 6)      |
| **Player 2 A1** | (20, 0)     | (4, 4)      |

So:
- If both play A0: (10, 10)
- If you play A1, other plays A0: (20, 0)
- If you play A0, other plays A1: (2, 6)
- If both play A1: (4, 4)

We are to choose a strategy (a probability distribution over A0 and A1) to maximize our expected points, assuming the other player is also optimizing.

But now, there's a **contract** proposed, and we must decide whether to **sign it**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract:  
- If you choose A0 → you receive an **additional 11 points**  
- This 11 points is **drawn equally from the other player** → so the other player loses 11 points if you choose A0  
- If you choose A1 → no additional payments

So, if you play A0 **and the contract is active**, you get **+11**, and the other player gets **-11**, *regardless of what they do*.

Note: This is **only active if all players sign**.

So, if you sign and the other player signs, the contract is active.

---

### **Step 3: How does the contract change payoffs?**

Let’s compute the **new payoffs** under the contract, assuming both sign.

We’ll rewrite the payoff matrix with the contract in effect.

#### Original payoffs → modify when A0 is chosen by either player.

**Player 2 chooses A0** → get +11  
**Player 1 chooses A0** → get +11 (if they play A0)  
But note: the contract says: *"If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players."*

So, **if you play A0**, you get +11, and the **other player loses 11** — regardless of what they play.

Same if they play A0: they get +11, you lose 11.

So:
- When you play A0 → you gain +11, the other loses 11
- When they play A0 → they gain +11, you lose 11

So the **net effect on your payoff** depends on **whether you play A0 or not**, and the other player’s move is irrelevant for this adjustment.

Wait: it says "drawn equally from the other players" — plural? But there’s only one other player. So "equally" just means entirely from the other player.

So yes: if you play A0, you get +11, the other player loses 11.

But note: **this affects both players.** So:

- If you play A0 → you gain +11
- If they play A0 → they gain +11

This is **not** a transfer from you to them; it's independent.

So the final payoff is:  
**Original payoff + (11 if you play A0) + (-11 if they play A0)**  
Wait — no. Let’s read carefully:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- When **you** play A0 → you get +11, and that +11 is taken from the other player (i.e., they lose 11)
- When **they** play A0 → they get +11, and you lose 11

So the net is:
- If **both** play A0:
  - You get: original (10) + 11 (from contract) - 11 (because they played A0) → 10
  - They get: original (10) + 11 (from contract) - 11 (because you played A0) → 10
- If **you** play A0, **they** play A1:
  - You: 2 + 11 - 0 → 13 (you get +11, they didn’t play A0, so no penalty to you)
  - They: 6 + 0 - 11 → -5 (they get no bonus, but lose 11 because you played A0)
- If **you** play A1, **they** play A0:
  - You: 20 + 0 - 11 → 9 (you played A1 → no bonus, but lose 11 because they played A0)
  - They: 0 + 11 - 0 → 11 (they get +11, you didn’t play A0, so no cost to them)
- If **both** play A1:
  - You: 4 + 0 - 0 → 4
  - They: 4 + 0 - 0 → 4

So the contract-transformed payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns) becomes:

|               | P1 A0         | P1 A1         |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **P2 A0**     | (10, 10)      | (13, -5)      |
| **P2 A1**     | (9, 11)       | (4, 4)        |

Wait — let's double-check:

- (A0, A0): you get 10 + 11 (your A0) - 11 (their A0) = 10 → correct  
- (A0, A1): you get 2 + 11 (your A0) = 13; they get 6 (original) + 0 (no A0 for them) - 11 (you played A0) = -5 → correct  
- (A1, A0): you get 20 + 0 - 11 (they played A0) = 9; they get 0 + 11 - 0 = 11 → correct  
- (A1, A1): both get 4, no changes → (4,4)

Yes.

### **Step 4: Analyze equilibrium under contract**

Assume both sign the contract → we use the new matrix.

Let’s find the **best response** for Player 2 (you), assuming Player 1 plays a mixed strategy.

But since we want to maximize **your** expected payoff, and the other player is rational (also wants to maximize their payoff), we need to consider **Nash equilibrium** under the contract.

But let's first ask: **Is it in your interest to sign the contract?**

Let’s compare:

- Option 1: **Don’t sign** → game remains base game
- Option 2: **Sign** → game becomes contract game

But: **the contract only takes effect if both sign.** So if you sign, and they don’t, the contract is **not active** → you get the original game.

But the question is: should you sign?

So we need to answer: *"Given that the other player is rational and will also decide optimally whether to sign, and if they don’t sign, contract is void, should I sign?"*

But we don’t know what the other player will do.

But: **we assume the other player is rational and self-interested.**

So we need to model this as a **two-stage game**:
1. Each player decides whether to sign the contract.
2. Then, the game is played according to the rules (with contract if both signed).

We must compute the expected payoff under **equilibrium strategies**.

But we are only asked: **should you sign?**

So let’s analyze under **expected payoff** in equilibrium.

Let’s compute the **best outcome for you** in the base game (without contract).

---

### **Step 5: Analyze base game (without contract)**

Payoff matrix:

|               | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0**     | 10    | 2     |
| **P2 A1**     | 20    | 4     |

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium.

Player 2:  
- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A1 (20 > 10)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2**!

No matter what the other player does, A1 gives you more points.

- If P1 plays A0: you get 20 (A1) vs 10 (A0) → better
- If P1 plays A1: you get 4 vs 2 → better

So Player 2 will **always play A1** in equilibrium.

Then Player 1: if P2 plays A1, their payoffs are:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4

So P1 prefers A1 (4 > 0)

So Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → you get 4 points.

But wait — is that the only equilibrium?

Could there be a mixed strategy?

Suppose P1 plays A1 with probability p, A0 with 1-p.

P2’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10(1-p) + 2p = 10 - 10p + 2p = 10 - 8p
- A1: 20(1-p) + 4p = 20 - 20p + 4p = 20 - 16p

Set equal: 10 - 8p = 20 - 16p → 8p = 10 → p = 10/8 = 1.25 > 1 → impossible

So since 20 - 16p > 10 - 8p for all p in [0,1], A1 strictly better.

So yes, **A1 dominates A0 for P2**.

P1’s best response to P2 playing A1 is A1.

So **unique Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1), payoff (4,4)**

So **without contract, you get 4 points**

---

### **Step 6: Now consider contract**

If both sign, we’re in the new game:

|               | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0**     | 10    | 13    |
| **P2 A1**     | 9     | 4     |

Let’s analyze this new game.

Player 2: compare A0 and A1.

If P1 plays A0: 10 vs 9 → P2 prefers A0
If P1 plays A1: 13 vs 4 → P2 prefers A0

So **A0 dominates A1 for Player 2!**

A0 gives better payoff no matter what P1 does.

So P2 will **always** play A0 if the contract is in effect.

Now P1: if P2 plays A0, P1’s payoffs:
- A0: 10
- A1: -5

So P1 prefers A0 (10 > -5)

So equilibrium: (A0, A0), you get 10 points.

So **if both sign the contract**, you get 10 points.

Better than 4.

But — is this **equilibrium**? Yes.

But: should you sign?

Only if **P1 also signs**.

Now, will P1 sign?

Let’s see: if P1 signs, and you sign → you both get 10 (as above)

But if P1 does **not** sign, then the contract is **not active** → you're back to base game.

P1’s decision: should they sign?

Let’s see what happens if P1 signs **but you don't** → contract not active → base game → P1’s payoff depends on what they do.

But again, **only if you sign too** is it active.

So we need to compute **P1’s payoff in equilibrium**, depending on whether they sign.

Let’s suppose P1 considers signing.

**Case 1: P1 signs the contract**

Then:
- If **you also sign**, contract active → P1 gets 10 (from (A0, A0) under contract)
- If **you do not sign**, contract not active → P1 plays base game → in equilibrium, P2 plays A1 → so P1 plays A1 → payoff 4

So P1’s expected payoff if they sign:
- If you sign: gets 10
- If you don’t sign: gets 4

But P1 doesn’t know for sure whether you’ll sign.

But we assume both are rational. So P1 must **anticipate** your behavior.

Now, **what will you do?**

You want to maximize your own payoff.

We’re analyzing whether you should sign.

So consider: **what if you sign?**

Then:
- If P1 signs → contract active → you get 10
- If P1 doesn’t sign → contract not active → base game → you get 4

So **if you sign**, you get 10 if P1 signs, 4 otherwise.

But since P1 is rational, we can ask: will P1 sign?

Let’s do backward induction.

Suppose you sign.

Then P1’s decision: sign or not?

- If P1 signs → contract active → P1 plays A0 (best response to you playing A0) → gets 10
- If P1 doesn’t sign → contract inactive → base game → P2 plays A1 → P1 plays A1 → gets 4

So P1 **prefers to sign** → gets 10 vs 4.

So if you sign, P1 will also sign → you get 10.

Now, suppose you **don’t sign**.

Then contract inactive regardless → no effect.

Then base game → we’re back to (A1, A1) → you get 4.

So:
- If you sign → you get 10 (because P1 will also sign, expecting to get 10 rather than 4)
- If you don’t sign → you get 4

So you **prefer to sign**.

Now, is this consistent?

Yes: if you sign, P1 signs (because they get 10 instead of 4), and then you both get 10.

If you don’t sign, you get only 4.

So **signing is strictly better for you**.

Now, just to check: what if P1 considers signing?

If P1 signs:
- If you sign → they get 10
- If you don’t → they get 4

So they want you to sign.

But P1 can only get 10 if you sign.

But P1 knows: if you don’t sign, they get only 4.

But will you sign? Only if you expect a better payoff.

And we’ve shown you get 10 by signing, vs 4 by not signing.

So P1 can expect that you'll sign **if they sign**.

So P1 should sign.

So there is a **coordinated equilibrium** where both sign, and both get 10.

And no one wants to deviate unilaterally.

- If you deviate (don’t sign), you get 4 instead of 10 → bad
- If P1 deviates (don’t sign), they get 4 instead of 10 → bad

So this is a **stable Nash equilibrium in the signing stage**.

Therefore, **signing is optimal**.

Even though the contract changes the game, it leads to a higher payoff for you (10) vs not signing (4), and others will follow suit.

Also note: the contract is **not a transfer that hurts you** — it’s **only active if both sign**, and in that case, it **shifts the equilibrium to your favor**.

Because under the contract, playing A0 becomes dominant for you, and the other player also prefers to play A0 (since they get 10 vs -5), so both play A0 → you get 10.

Without contract, you’re stuck at 4.

So clearly better.

### ✅ Final Answer:

You should sign the contract.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

response:
Step 1: Work out what happens in the original game (no contract)  
- Player 2 always prefers **A1** (it strictly beats A0 regardless of what I do).  
- Then my best response to Player 2 playing A1 is **A1**.  
So the outcome is (A1, A1) with my payoff **4**.

Step 2: Analyze Contract C1 (A0 gives +11, paid by the other player)  
With 2 players, “drawn equally from the other players” means: if I play A0, I get +11 and the other player pays -11.

Payoffs to me under C1:
- (A0,A0): 10 (transfers cancel)
- (A0,A1): 0 + 11 = **11**
- (A1,A0): 6 − 11 = **−5**
- (A1,A1): 4

Now Player 2’s incentives under C1:
- If Player 2 plays A0, they do better than playing A1 regardless of what I do (A0 becomes a dominant action for them).
So equilibrium becomes **(A0, A0)**, giving me **10**.

Step 3: Analyze Contract C2 (A0 gives +5)  
Payoffs to me under C2:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A0,A1): 0 + 5 = **5**
- (A1,A0): 6 − 5 = **1**
- (A1,A1): 4

Under C2, **A0 is dominant for me** (it beats A1 no matter what Player 2 does).  
Then Player 2 best-responds to my A0 by choosing A1 (since 15 > 10 for them).  
So equilibrium is **(A0, A1)**, giving me **5**.

Step 4: Decide approvals strategically  
- I prefer C1 (10) over C2 (5).  
- Player 2 prefers C2 (15) over C1 (10), so they’ll likely approve C2 (and likely not approve C1).
To maximize my chance of getting C1 selected, I should **approve C1 and reject C2**. If each of us approves only our favored contract, it’s a 1–1 tie and C1 is chosen with 50% probability (better for me than guaranteeing C2).

Final approvals (JSON):
{"C1": true, "C2": false}

response:
To decide which contract(s) to approve, let's analyze the impact of each proposed contract on the outcomes and the expected points.

### Basic Game Analysis (Without Contracts)

First, let's calculate the expected points for each player based on the actions chosen:

- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 10 points, Player 1 gets 10 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 20 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 2 points, Player 1 gets 6 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 4 points, Player 1 gets 4 points.

### Contract Analysis

#### Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other player.
  - This means if both players choose A0, each receives an additional 11 points from the other, effectively canceling out.
  - If Player 2 chooses A0, they receive 11 points, but Player 1 will lose 11 points.
  - This contract heavily incentivizes choosing A0.

Let's see the adjusted payoffs:
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 21 points, Player 1 gets 21 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 9 points, Player 1 gets 11 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 13 points, Player 1 gets -5 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 4 points, Player 1 gets 4 points.

#### Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.
  - This means if both players choose A0, each receives an additional 5 points from the other, effectively canceling out.
  - If Player 2 chooses A0, they receive 5 points, but Player 1 will lose 5 points.
  - This contract slightly incentivizes choosing A0.

Let's see the adjusted payoffs:
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 15 points, Player 1 gets 15 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 17.5 points, Player 1 gets 2.5 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 7.5 points, Player 1 gets 3.5 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 4 points, Player 1 gets 4 points.

### Decision Making

Since your goal is to maximize your own points:

#### Contract C1 Analysis:
- Choosing A0 against A0: 21 points (fairly balanced but heavy swings).
- Choosing A1 against A0: 9 points (suboptimal for you).
- Choosing A0 against A1: 13 points (heavy penalty to Player 1).
- Choosing A1 against A1: 4 points (balanced).

Overall, C1 heavily favors choosing A0 to maximize mutual points, but can result in huge swings that aren't guaranteed.

#### Contract C2 Analysis:
- Choosing A0 against A0: 15 points (well balanced).
- Choosing A1 against A0: 17.5 points (better return, incentivized to choose A1).
- Choosing A0 against A1: 7.5 points (moderate penalty to Player 1).
- Choosing A1 against A1: 4 points (balanced).

Overall, C2 slightly favors choices that lead to more stable and balanced outcomes without extremely high penalties.

### Final Decision

Given that C2 provides more balanced and stable outcomes without drastic penalties or benefits, it is generally more favorable for you.

response:
The decision to sign the payment contract involves analyzing the game's payoffs both with and without the contract's provisions.

### 1. Basic Game Analysis (Without the Contract)
The game is as follows (presented as (Player 1, Player 2)):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20) — *Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0*
- (A1, A0): (6, 2) — *Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1*
- (A1, A1): (4, 4) — *Both choose A1*

In the basic game:
- For Player 2: If Player 1 plays A0, P2 gets 20 (A1) vs. 10 (A0). If Player 1 plays A1, P2 gets 4 (A1) vs. 2 (A0). Action A1 is dominant.
- For Player 1: If Player 2 plays A1 (dominant strategy), P1 gets 4 (A1) vs. 0 (A0).
- The Nash Equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Analysis with the Contract
The contract specifies: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 12 points, drawn equally from the other player."

- **(A0, A0):** Both receive 12 and pay 12. Net change is 0. Payoff: **(10, 10)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 (receives 12 from P2). Player 2 chooses A1 (pays 12 to P1). Payoff: (0 + 12, 20 - 12) = **(12, 8)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1 (pays 12 to P2). Player 2 chooses A0 (receives 12 from P1). Payoff: (6 - 12, 2 + 12) = **(-6, 14)**.
- **(A1, A1):** No changes. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.

In this adjusted game:
- For Player 1: If P2 plays A0, 10 (A0) > -6 (A1). If P2 plays A1, 12 (A0) > 4 (A1). Action A0 is now dominant.
- For Player 2: If P1 plays A0, 10 (A0) > 8 (A1). If P1 plays A1, 14 (A0) > 4 (A1). Action A0 is now dominant.
- The Nash Equilibrium is **(A0, A0)**, resulting in **10 points** for each player.

### 3. Comparison and Conclusion
- Without signing: Equilibrium (A1, A1) yields 4 points for Player 2.
- By signing (if both sign): Equilibrium (A0, A0) yields 10 points for Player 2.
- Since 10 > 4, signing the contract maximizes the potential total points regardless of the basic game's competitive nature.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the game after accounting for the payment contract. 

### Original Payoff Matrix (P1, P2):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### The Contract Impact:
- If a player chooses **A0**, they receive **+11 points** from the other player.
- If a player chooses **A1**, there are no transfers.

### New Payoff Matrix (After Contract):
1.  **(A0, A0):**
    - Player 1: $10 + 11 (\text{from P2}) - 11 (\text{to P2}) = 10$
    - Player 2: $10 + 11 (\text{from P1}) - 11 (\text{to P1}) = 10$
    - **Result: (10, 10)**
2.  **(A0, A1):**
    - Player 1: $0 + 11 (\text{from P2}) = 11$
    - Player 2: $20 - 11 (\text{to P1}) = 9$
    - **Result: (11, 9)**
3.  **(A1, A0):**
    - Player 1: $6 - 11 (\text{to P2}) = -5$
    - Player 2: $2 + 11 (\text{from P1}) = 13$
    - **Result: (-5, 13)**
4.  **(A1, A1):**
    - Neither pays nor receives anything additional.
    - **Result: (4, 4)**

### Strategic Analysis:
- **For Player 1:**
    - If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets **10** (A0) or **-5** (A1).
    - If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets **11** (A0) or **4** (A1).
    - In both scenarios, A0 provides a higher payoff than A1. Thus, **A0 is a dominant strategy**.
- **For Player 2:**
    - If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets **10** (A0) or **9** (A1).
    - If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets **13** (A0) or **4** (A1).
    - In both scenarios, A0 provides a higher payoff than A1. Thus, **A0 is also a dominant strategy** for Player 2.

The contract transforms the game such that choosing A0 is the optimal move regardless of the other player's decision. Both players choosing A0 leads to a stable Nash Equilibrium where both receive 10 points.

response:
To approach this problem, let's consider the given setup, the payouts, and the fact that the contract modification was rejected. Our goal is to maximize our total points.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Payout Matrix without Contract
- If both players choose A0:
  - Player 2: 10 points
  - Other player: 10 points
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - Player 2: 20 points
  - Other player: 0 points
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - Player 2: 2 points
  - Other player: 6 points
- If both players choose A1:
  - Player 2: 4 points
  - Other player: 4 points

#### Strategy without Contract
To maximize our score, we have to consider how likely the other player is to pick each action and what our best responses to these actions are. 

If the other player were to act purely to maximize their score, what might they choose? We can guess their likely strategy and devise a counter-strategy.

1. **Assume the Other Player's Rationality**:
   - Player 1 is likely rational and would want to maximize their own points. Without additional information, Player 1's choices might be distributed based on expected payoffs.

2. **Expected Payoffs for Player 1**:
   - If they assume Player 2 (you) plays A0:
     - Payoff from A0: 10 points
     - Payoff from A1: 6 points
   - If they assume Player 2 (you) plays A1:
     - Payoff from A0: 0 points
     - Payoff from A1: 4 points

Player 1's rational choice when assuming Player 2 plays A0 heavily favors A0 (better than A1), however, if they expect Player 2 to play mixed or A1 more often, their choice might shift toward A1 periodically.

#### Mixed Strategy Equilibrium
This game is similar to the classic coordination game and mixed strategy potentially stabilizes.

Let's consider mixed strategies:
- Let \( p \) be the probability that Player 2 (you) plays A0, and \( 1 - p \) be the probability that Player 2 plays A1.

For Player 2:
- Expected payoff if Player 2 chooses A0:
\[ E[A0] = 10P(A0) + 2P(A1) \]
- Expected payoff if Player 2 chooses A1:
\[ E[A1] = 20P(A0) + 4P(A1) \]

For equilibrium, we want these payoffs equal:
\[ 10P(A0) + 2P(A1) = 20P(A0) + 4P(A1) \]
\[ 10P(A0) + 2(1 - P(A0)) = 20P(A0) + 4(1 - P(A0)) \]
\[ 10P(A0) + 2 - 2P(A0) = 20P(A0) + 4 - 4P(A0) \]
\[ 8P(A0) + 2 = 16P(A0) + 4 \]
\[ 2 = 8P(A0) + 4 \]
\[ -2 = 8P(A0) \]

\[ P(A0) = \frac{-2}{8} \]

- This approach seems mathematically inconsistent when payouts are positive. 

Therefore, due to lack of straightforward equilibrium, let's use an optimal intuitive 50-50 mixed strategy to give us insights, balancing the downside and upside.
 
### Final Optimal Strategic Choice (60% - 40%)
Given equilibrium complexity and common mixed strategy:

{"A0": 60, "A1": 40}

response:
First compute what each contract does to the actual payoffs (original payoff + transfers), then predict the equilibrium outcome under each contract, then vote strategically.

### Baseline (no contract)
Player 2 has a dominant action **A1**, so the equilibrium is **(A1, A1)** giving me **4**.

---

## Contract C1 (reward A0 with +11 taken from the other player)
Transfer rule: if I play **A0** I get +11 (other pays 11); if the other plays **A0** I pay 11.

My payoffs become:

- (A0,A0): 10 +11 −11 = **10**
- (A0,A1): 0 +11 = **11**
- (A1,A0): 6 −11 = **−5**
- (A1,A1): 4 = **4**

For Player 2, **A0** becomes dominant, so equilibrium is **(A0, A0)** giving me **10**.

So **C1 gives me 10**.

---

## Contract C2 (penalize A1 by paying 5 to the other player)
Transfer rule: if I play **A1** I pay 5; if the other plays **A1** I receive 5.

My payoffs become:

- (A0,A0): **10**
- (A0,A1): 0 +5 = **5**
- (A1,A0): 6 −5 = **1**
- (A1,A1): 4 (−5 +5 cancels) = **4**

I now have dominant **A0**; Player 2 best-responds with **A1** to my A0, so equilibrium is **(A0, A1)** giving me **5**.

So **C2 gives me 5**.

---

## Voting strategy
- I strongly prefer **C1 (10)** over **C2 (5)**.
- Player 2 likely prefers **C2** (they get 15 under C2 vs 10 under C1), so if I approved C2, I’d risk making C2 the unique winner.

So I approve **only C1** to maximize my expected outcome.

agent: openai/gpt-5.2(CoT)#P1
response:
Step 1: Work out the induced payoffs under each contract (since there are only 2 players, “drawn equally from the other players” means a direct transfer between us).

### Contract C1 (A0 bonus = 11)
- (A0,A0): each gets +11 and pays 11 → net 0 transfer → payoffs stay **(10,10)**
- (A0,A1): P1 gets +11 from P2 → **(11, 20−11=9)**
- (A1,A0): P2 gets +11 from P1 → **(6−11=−5, 2+11=13)**
- (A1,A1): unchanged → **(4,4)**

Best responses:
- Player 2 still strictly prefers **A0** regardless of what I do (A0 is dominant for P2).
- Given P2 plays A0, I strictly prefer **A0** (10 > −5).
So equilibrium remains **(A0,A0)** with my payoff **10**.

### Contract C2 (A0 bonus = 5)
- (A0,A0): net 0 transfer → **(10,10)**
- (A0,A1): **(5, 20−5=15)**
- (A1,A0): **(6−5=1, 2+5=7)**
- (A1,A1): **(4,4)**

Best responses:
- I (P1) now have a dominant action **A0** (10>1 and 5>4).
- If I play A0, P2 prefers **A1** (15 > 10).
So equilibrium becomes **(A0,A1)** and my payoff is **5**, which is worse than under C1.

Step 2: Voting logic
Approving C2 risks making it the uniquely most-approved contract (likely, since it benefits P2 a lot), which would lock in my worse equilibrium payoff (5). Approving only C1 maximizes my chance of getting the better contract.

2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

### Step 1: Baseline game (no contract)
Best responses:
- For **Player 2 (me)**:  
  - If P1 plays A0: A1 gives 20 vs A0 gives 10 ⇒ prefer **A1**  
  - If P1 plays A1: A1 gives 4 vs A0 gives 2 ⇒ prefer **A1**  
  So **A1 strictly dominates** for me.
- For **Player 1**:  
  - If I play A0: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives 0 ⇒ prefer **A0**  
  - If I play A1: A0 gives 6 vs A1 gives 4 ⇒ prefer **A0**  
  So **A0 strictly dominates** for P1.

Equilibrium: **(P1 A0, P2 A1)** giving me **20**.

---

### Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)
Rule: If you play **A0**, you get **+11**, taken from the other player.

Payoffs (P1, P2):
- (A0, A0): (10,10) (transfers cancel)
- (A0, A1): base (0,20) plus transfer to P1 ⇒ (11, 9)
- (A1, A0): base (6,2) plus transfer to P2 ⇒ (-5, 13)
- (A1, A1): (4,4)

Best responses:
- For me (P2): A0 beats A1 whether P1 plays A0 (10>9) or A1 (13>4) ⇒ **A0 dominates**
- For P1: A0 still dominates.

Equilibrium becomes **(A0, A0)** giving me **10**.  
So I **do not** want C1.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)
Rule: If you play **A1**, you **pay 5** to the other player.

Payoffs (P1, P2):
- (A0, A0): (10,10)
- (A0, A1): base (0,20) with P2 paying 5 ⇒ (5, 15)
- (A1, A0): base (6,2) with P1 paying 5 ⇒ (1, 7)
- (A1, A1): (4,4) (payments cancel)

Best responses:
- P1: A0 still dominates (10>1 and 5>4).
- Given P1 plays A0, my best response is A1 (15>10).

Equilibrium: **(A0, A1)** giving me **15**.  
This is worse than baseline (20), but better than C1 (10).

---

### Step 4: Approval strategy
If I don’t approve C2, Player 1 could push C1 through (which is worst for me). Approving **only C2** is the best defensive/strategic vote: it prevents C1 from winning outright and can make C2 win if Player 1 approves both.

Final approvals:
```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}
```

response:
Let's break down the decision step by step to determine whether to sign the contract or not.

### Step 1: Understand the Payoffs without the Contract

#### Payoff Matrix without Contract
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 10 points, Player 1 gets 10 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 20 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 2 points, Player 1 gets 6 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 4 points, Player 1 gets 4 points.

### Step 2: Understand the Contract Impact on Payoffs

#### Contract Details
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

#### Adjusted Payoffs with Contract
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A0: 
  - Player 2 receives \(10 + 11 = 21\) points (net gain considering Player 1 loses 11 points).
  - Player 1 also receives \(10 + 11 = 21\) points (net gain considering Player 2 loses 11 points).
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Player 2 receives \(20\) points.
  - Player 1 receives \(-11\) points (loses 11 points without gaining any from the contract).
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Player 2 receives \(2 + 11 = 13\) points.
  - Player 1 receives \(6 - 11 = -5\) points (loses 11 points).
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Player 2 receives \(4\) points.
  - Player 1 receives \(4\) points.

### Step 3: Evaluate Payoffs

#### Without Contract
- Both mutual cooperation on A0 yields \(10, 10\).
- Betray (A1 for Player 2) and cooperate (A0 for Player 1) yields \(20, 0\).
- Cooperate (A0 for Player 2) and betray (A1 for Player 1) yields \(2, 6\).
- Both betray on A1 yields \(4, 4\).

#### With Contract
- Both mutual cooperation on A0 yields \(21, 21\).
- Betray and cooperate yields \(20, -11\) (Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets negative points).
- Cooperate and betray yields \(13, -5\) (Player 2 gets positive, Player 1 gets negative points).
- Both betray on A1 yields \(4, 4\).

### Step 4: Optimal Strategy Analysis
- Without a contract, dominant strategy for Player 2 is to choose A1 since it maximizes their minimum payoff.
- With a contract, choosing A1 when Player 1 chooses A0 or A1 penalizes Player 1 heavily. Player 1 would realize the penalty and might consistently choose A0, promoting mutual cooperation.

Given that **both players would lean towards mutual cooperation because the contract incentivizes A0 (both gaining 21 points while keeping the net balance fair), it seems reasonable to sign the contract**.

### Step 5: Decision and Reasoning
The contract aligns both players' interests towards cooperation and maximizes the total payoff in a balanced manner. Mutual agreement on A0 with a contract benefits both significantly.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

| My Action | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| A0        | 10           | 2            |
| A1        | 20           | 4            |

## Step 2: Apply the contract modifier

The contract states: If a player chooses A0, they receive +11 points (drawn from the other player).

This means:
- If I choose A0: I get +11, Player 1 pays -11
- If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 1 gets +11, I pay -11

## Step 3: Calculate modified payoffs for me (Player 2)

| My Action | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| A0        | 10 + 11 - 11 = **10** | 2 + 11 = **13** |
| A1        | 20 - 11 = **9**       | 4 = **4**       |

## Step 4: Analyze the optimal strategy

Comparing my payoffs:
- If Player 1 chooses A0: I get 10 from A0 vs 9 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If Player 1 chooses A1: I get 13 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** regardless of what Player 1 does.

## Step 5: Determine the probability distribution

Since A0 is strictly dominant, the optimal strategy is to choose A0 with 100% probability.

The contract successfully incentivizes cooperation - it transforms what would have been a prisoner's dilemma into a situation where mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) becomes the dominant strategy equilibrium.

Looking at this problem, I need to compare my payoffs under different contracts versus no contract.

## Step 1: Analyze the game without any contract

Let me first find the equilibrium without contracts.

**My payoffs (Player 2):**
- If P1 plays A0: I get 10 for A0, or 20 for A1 → I prefer A1
- If P1 plays A1: I get 2 for A0, or 4 for A1 → I prefer A1

So **A1 strictly dominates A0** for me - I always play A1.

**Player 1's payoffs:**
- If I play A0: P1 gets 10 for A0, or 0 for A1 → P1 prefers A0
- If I play A1: P1 gets 6 for A0, or 4 for A1 → P1 prefers A0

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1.

**Equilibrium without contract:** P1 plays A0, I play A1 → **I get 20 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Modified payoffs for me (Player 2):
- Both play A0: 10 + 11 - 11 = **10**
- P1 plays A1, I play A0: 2 + 11 - 0 = **13**
- P1 plays A0, I play A1: 20 + 0 - 11 = **9**
- Both play A1: 4 + 0 - 0 = **4**

Under Contract 1:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives me 10 > A1 gives me 9 → I prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives me 13 > A1 gives me 4 → I prefer A0

For Player 1, A0 becomes even more dominant (they get 17 if I play A1, and avoid the -11 penalty).

**Equilibrium under Contract 1:** Both play A0 → **I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Modified payoffs for me (Player 2):
- Both play A0: 10 + 0 + 0 = **10**
- P1 plays A1, I play A0: 2 + 0 + 10 = **12**
- P1 plays A0, I play A1: 20 - 10 + 0 = **10**
- Both play A1: 4 - 10 + 10 = **4**

Under Contract 2:
- Player 1 will definitely play A0 (it strictly dominates A1)
- Given P1 plays A0, I'm indifferent between A0 (gives 10) and A1 (gives 10)

**Equilibrium under Contract 2:** P1 plays A0, I play anything → **I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Comparison

- **No contract:** I get 20 points
- **Contract 1:** I get 10 points
- **Contract 2:** I get 10 points

Both contracts are significantly worse for me than no contract!

## Step 5: Approval Decision

From Player 1's perspective:
- No contract: 6 points
- Either contract: 10 points

Player 1 strongly prefers any contract. However, if I reject both contracts and Player 1 also rejects both, then no contract is implemented and I get my optimal 20 points.

Even if Player 1 approves contracts, my best strategy is to reject both because:
- If P1 also rejects: No contract → I get 20 ✓
- If P1 approves: A contract wins → I get 10 (same as if I approved)

By rejecting both, I maintain the possibility of the no-contract outcome.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break down the problem step-by-step to understand the optimal strategy for maximizing the points received.

### Step 1: Understanding the Basic Payoff Matrix
The payoffs from the decisions without considering the payment contract are:
- (A0, A0): You get 10, the other player gets 10
- (A1, A0): You get 20, the other player gets 0
- (A0, A1): You get 2, the other player gets 6
- (A1, A1): You get 4, the other player gets 4

### Step 2: Understanding the Payment Contract
The contract modifies the payoff by adding/subtracting 11 points:
- Choosing A0 yields an additional +11 points, deducted from the other player.
- Choosing A1 has no additional payments.

### Step 3: Updating the Payoff Matrix
With the payment contract in place, we need to adjust each possible outcome:
- (A0, A0): You get 21 (10 + 11), the other player gets -1 (10 - 11)
- (A1, A0): You get 20, the other player gets -11 (0 - 11)
- (A0, A1): You get 13 (2 + 11), the other player gets -5 (6 - 11)
- (A1, A1): You get 4, the other player gets 4

### Step 4: Analyzing Your Best Strategy
Given you are Player 2, you need to assume that Player 1 is also seeking to maximize their own payoff. Let's consider mixed strategies and the expected payoffs:

Let's assume Player 1 plays the strategies with probabilities:
- p(A0) = p, 
- p(A1) = (1-p)

For you (Player 2), let's assume you play strategies with:
- p(A0) = q,
- p(A1) = (1-q)

### Step 5: Calculating Expected Payoffs
Your expected payoff can be calculated as follows:
\[E(Y) = p \cdot q \cdot 21 + (1 - p) \cdot q \cdot 13 + p \cdot (1 - q) \cdot 20 + (1 - p) \cdot (1 - q) \cdot 4\]
\[E(Y) = 21pq + 13q(1-p) + 20p(1-q) + 4(1-p)(1-q)\]
\[E(Y) = 21pq + 13q - 13pq + 20p - 20pq + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq\]
\[E(Y) = 4 + 4pq - 4p + 4q + 4p + 17pq - 4pq\]
\[E(Y) = 4 + 17pq + 9q + 16p\]
(rearranging for clarity)

In examining the game, playing A1 always yields guaranteed points without penalty from the contract. 

### Step 6: Conclusion
Given the asymmetry introduced by the contract, and aiming at a consistent scoring strategy, choosing A1 seems to be a stable strategy because it avoids the negative payoff adjustments applied through the contract.

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "A0": 0,
  "A1": 100
}
```

Let's go through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Payoff Matrix**

We are Player 2 (you), and you're playing a simultaneous game with Player 1.

The base payoffs (before contract) are:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-------------------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (You)**                  | 10, 10 | 2, 6   |
| **A1 (You)**                  | 20, 0  | 4, 4   |

So for **you** (Player 2), the base payoffs are:

- (A0 vs A0): 10
- (A0 vs A1): 2
- (A1 vs A0): 20
- (A1 vs A1): 4

---

### **Step 2: Incorporate the Contract**

The contract says:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 11 points**, drawn equally from the other players.

This is **per player** — so if you choose A0, you get +11 points **regardless** of what the other player does.  
Conversely, **if you choose A1**, you get **no bonus**, and **you don’t pay anything**.

But — the **11 points are drawn equally from the other players**. That means:

- If **you choose A0**, you get +11 **from the other player**.
- If **the other player chooses A0**, they get +11 from you.
- So, you lose 11 points if **you** choose A1 and **they** choose A0.
- You gain 11 points if **you** choose A0 and **they** choose A1 — but only if the other player is paying you?

Wait — let's clarify **who pays whom**.

The contract says:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So, **if you choose A0**, you **gain 11 points**, and this is **taken from the other player**. So:

- If you choose A0 → you get +11 from the other player.
- If the other player chooses A0 → they get +11 from **you**.

So this is **a bilateral transfer**: if both choose A0, then:
- You get +11 from P1
- P1 gets +11 from you
→ Net: you pay 11 to P1, and receive 11 from P1 → net zero for the contract part, but each gets +11 from the contract mechanism.

But wait — can they draw 11 from the other player? That would mean **each A0 choice leads to a net +11 to that player and -11 to the other player**, **if the other player is not choosing A0**.

Wait! Let's think carefully.

The contract says:

> "drawn equally from the other players"

→ "other players" plural? But it's a two-player game.

So it probably means: "drawn from the other player" (singular).

So if **you choose A0**, you get +11, and the **other player pays you 11**.

If **they choose A0**, they get +11, and **you pay them 11**.

That’s the intended meaning.

So the contract is a **transfer** based on action choice.

**Important**: If **both choose A0**, then:
- You get +11 (from them)
- You pay them 11 (because they chose A0)
→ net: 0 from the contract

If **you choose A0**, **they choose A1**:
- You get +11 (from them)
- They do **not** choose A0, so they don’t get anything → so they pay you nothing
- You pay nothing (you chose A0, but they didn’t)
→ You gain +11, they lose 11.

If **you choose A1**, **they choose A0**:
- You pay nothing (you chose A1)
- They get +11 from you
- You lose 11 (because they chose A0)
→ You: -11, They: +11

If **both choose A1**:
- No one gets anything → contract has no effect.

---

### **Step 3: Combine Base Payoffs with Contract**

Let’s compute **your total payoff** (Player 2) for each combination, **including contract transfers**.

#### Case 1: You A0, P1 A0
- Base: 10
- You chose A0 → +11 from P1
- P1 chose A0 → -11 to you
→ Net contract: 0
→ Total: 10 + 0 = **10**

#### Case 2: You A0, P1 A1
- Base: 2
- You chose A0 → +11 from P1
- P1 chose A1 → no +11 for P1, so P1 pays you nothing
→ You get +11 from contract
→ Total: 2 + 11 = **13**

#### Case 3: You A1, P1 A0
- Base: 20
- You chose A1 → no contract benefit
- P1 chose A0 → P1 gets +11 from you → you pay 11
→ Contract cost: -11
→ Total: 20 - 11 = **9**

#### Case 4: You A1, P1 A1
- Base: 4
- No one chose A0 → no contract effect
→ Total: **4**

---

### **Updated Payoff Matrix for You (Player 2):**

| You \ P1 | A0       | A1       |
|----------|----------|----------|
| A0       | 10       | **13**   |
| A1       | **9**    | 4        |

So your payoff is:

- A0 vs A0: 10
- A0 vs A1: 13
- A1 vs A0: 9
- A1 vs A1: 4

---

### **Step 4: Determine Best Strategy (Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium)**

We now need to find your optimal strategy (probability to play A0 and A1) to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming the other player is also optimizing.

Let:
- You play A0 with probability **p**
- You play A1 with probability **1 - p**

Let the other player (P1) play A0 with probability **q**, A1 with probability **1 - q**

Your expected payoff is:

E = p * [q * 10 + (1 - q) * 13] + (1 - p) * [q * 9 + (1 - q) * 4]

Let’s expand:

E = p [10q + 13(1 - q)] + (1 - p)[9q + 4(1 - q)]
E = p [10q + 13 - 13q] + (1 - p)[9q + 4 - 4q]
E = p [13 - 3q] + (1 - p)[4 + 5q]

Now expand:

E = p(13 - 3q) + (1 - p)(4 + 5q)
= 13p - 3pq + (4 + 5q) - p(4 + 5q)
= 13p - 3pq + 4 + 5q - 4p - 5pq
= (13p - 4p) + (-3pq - 5pq) + 4 + 5q
= 9p - 8pq + 4 + 5q

So:

E = 9p - 8pq + 5q + 4

Now, **you are trying to maximize E**, but **q is chosen by P1**, and we assume P1 is also rational.

So we look for a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** — a strategy where neither player wants to deviate.

Let’s suppose that **P1** is playing in a way that makes **you indifferent** between A0 and A1.

So let’s find **q** such that your expected payoff from playing A0 equals your expected payoff from playing A1.

#### Expected payoff if you play A0:

E(A0) = q * 10 + (1 - q) * 13 = 10q + 13 - 13q = 13 - 3q

#### Expected payoff if you play A1:

E(A1) = q * 9 + (1 - q) * 4 = 9q + 4 - 4q = 5q + 4

Set them equal:

13 - 3q = 5q + 4  
13 - 4 = 5q + 3q  
9 = 8q  
q = 9/8 = 1.125 → Wait, **invalid** (probability can’t be >1)

This is impossible. So there is **no q in [0,1]** such that E(A0) = E(A1)

So the indifference is not possible between 0 and 1. Let’s see which strategy is better.

Let’s compare E(A0) and E(A1) for different values of q:

- At q = 0 (P1 plays A1 always):
  - E(A0) = 13
  - E(A1) = 4 → A0 better

- At q = 1 (P1 plays A0 always):
  - E(A0) = 10
  - E(A1) = 9 → A0 still better

Wait: at q = 1,
- E(A0) = 10
- E(A1) = 5(1) + 4 = 9 → 10 > 9 → A0 still better

At q = 0: 13 > 4 → A0 better

So for **all q**, E(A0) > E(A1)

Because:
E(A0) = 13 - 3q ≥ 13 - 3(1) = 10  
E(A1) = 5q + 4 ≤ 5(1) + 4 = 9

So E(A0) ≥ 10, E(A1) ≤ 9 → for all q ∈ [0,1], E(A0) > E(A1)

So **no matter what P1 does**, playing A0 gives you **strictly better expected payoff** than playing A1.

Therefore, your best response to any strategy of P1 is to play **A0 with probability 100%**.

But wait — is that really true?

Wait: what if P1 is also rational? But you're trying to maximize your **own** payoff.

And since **A0 dominates A1** (you get higher payoff for every possible choice of P1), then **A0 is strictly dominant**.

Let’s confirm:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - You: A0 → 10, A1 → 9 → A0 better
- If P1 plays A1:
  - You: A0 → 13, A1 → 4 → A0 better

Yes — in **both cases**, choosing A0 gives you a higher payoff.

Therefore, **A0 strictly dominates A1** in your payoff matrix.

So you should **always play A0**.

Even though the contract gives you +11 for choosing A0, and might make it costly if the opponent chooses A0 (if you had to pay them), but **in reality, when you choose A0 and they choose A0, you get +11 from them and pay them +11** → net zero.

But still, your base payoff is 10 in that case, which is better than A1's 9.

And when they choose A1, you get +11 extra, making it 13 vs 4.

So yes, **A0 is always better**, regardless of what P1 does.

### **Step 5: Final Strategy**

Since A0 is strictly dominant, you should play **A0 with 100% probability**.

So your probability distribution is:

- A0: 100
- A1: 0

### **Final Answer:**

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

First incorporate the contract’s transfers (2 players total, so the full 5 points go to the other player):

- If I play **A1**, I **pay 5** (−5 to me).
- If Player 2 plays **A1**, they **pay me 5** (+5 to me).

Adjusted payoffs for **me (Player 1)**:

- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 0 + 5 = 5
- (A1, A0): 6 − 5 = 1
- (A1, A1): 4 (pay 5 and receive 5, net 0 transfer)

So my payoffs by my action:

- If Player 2 plays **A0**: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 1 → A0 better.
- If Player 2 plays **A1**: A0 gives 5, A1 gives 4 → A0 better.

Thus **A0 strictly dominates A1**, so I should put all probability on A0.

Step 1: Baseline game (no contract)  
Player 2 has a dominant action A1 (it yields 20 vs 10 if you play A0, and 4 vs 2 if you play A1).  
So the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with your payoff = 4.

Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (reward A0 by +11 paid by the other player)  
This changes payoffs (including transfers) for you to:
- (A0,A0): 10 (transfer cancels)
- (A0,A1): 11
- (A1,A0): -5
- (A1,A1): 4

Under C1, both players strictly prefer A0 regardless of what the other does (A0 becomes dominant for both).  
Equilibrium becomes (A0, A0) with your payoff = 10 (better than 4).

Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (penalize A1 by paying 10 to the other player)  
Your payoffs become:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A0,A1): 10
- (A1,A0): -4
- (A1,A1): 4 (net transfer cancels)

Under C2, you strictly prefer A0 regardless of the other player’s action (A0 becomes dominant for you), and Player 2 weakly prefers A0.  
Equilibrium (and safe outcome) is again (A0, A0) with your payoff = 10 (better than 4).

Step 4: Approval decision  
Both contracts (C1 and C2) improve your equilibrium payoff from 4 to 10, and approving both maximizes the chance that at least one beneficial contract is selected.

Adjust the payoffs to include the contract transfer:

- If you play **A0**, you **receive +11** from the other player.
- If the other player plays **A0**, you **pay 11** to them.
- If someone plays **A1**, no transfer happens for that player.

So your (Player 1) payoffs become:

- (A0, A0): 10 (you get +11 and pay 11 → net 0 transfer)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 11 = **11**
- (A1, A0): 6 − 11 = **−5**
- (A1, A1): **4**

Let \(q\) be the probability the other player plays A0.

- Expected payoff if you play **A0**: \(U(A0)=10q + 11(1-q)=11-q\)
- Expected payoff if you play **A1**: \(U(A1)=-5q + 4(1-q)=4-9q\)

Compare:
\( (11-q) - (4-9q) = 7 + 8q > 0 \) for all \(q \in [0,1]\).

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you, meaning you should play A0 with probability 1.

First adjust payoffs for the contract:

- If you play **A1**, you pay 5 to the other player (since there’s only one other player).
- If the other player plays **A1**, they pay 5 to you.

So your net payoffs become:

- (You A0, Other A0): \(10\)
- (You A1, Other A0): \(20 - 5 = 15\)
- (You A0, Other A1): \(2 + 5 = 7\)
- (You A1, Other A1): \(4 - 5 + 5 = 4\)

Now check the other player’s incentives (their net payoffs):

- If you play A0:  
  - Other A0: \(10\)  
  - Other A1: \(6 - 5 = 1\)  → prefers **A0**
- If you play A1:  
  - Other A0: \(0 + 5 = 5\)  
  - Other A1: \(4\) → prefers **A0**

So the other player has a **strictly dominant action A0**.

Given that, your best response to Other=A0 is **A1** (since 15 > 10). Therefore, play A1 with probability 1.

response:
To maximize the points received as Player 2, let's analyze the game and the impact of the payment contract step by step.

### 1. Identify the Base Payoffs (P1, P2)
Based on the payoff description when you are Player 2:
*   (P1: A0, P2: A0) = (10, 10)
*   (P1: A0, P2: A1) = (0, 20) (Other=0, You=20)
*   (P1: A1, P2: A0) = (6, 2) (Other=6, You=2)
*   (P1: A1, P2: A1) = (4, 4)

### 2. Apply the Payment Contract
The contract specifies:
*   If a player chooses A0, they receive 12 points from the other player.
*   If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments in either direction (i.e., that player's choice does not trigger any payments).

Now, we calculate the total payoffs (Base Payoff + Payments Received - Payments Given):
*   **(A0, A0):**
    P1 receives 12 from P2 (for choosing A0).
    P2 receives 12 from P1 (for choosing A0).
    P1 total: 10 + 12 - 12 = **10**
    P2 total: 10 + 12 - 12 = **10**
*   **(A0, A1):**
    P1 receives 12 from P2 (for choosing A0).
    P2 chooses A1 (no payment triggered).
    P1 total: 0 + 12 = **12**
    P2 total: 20 - 12 = **8**
*   **(A1, A0):**
    P2 receives 12 from P1 (for choosing A0).
    P1 chooses A1 (no payment triggered).
    P1 total: 6 - 12 = **-6**
    P2 total: 2 + 12 = **14**
*   **(A1, A1):**
    No payments triggered.
    P1 total: **4**
    P2 total: **4**

### 3. Analyze the New Payoff Matrix (P1, P2)
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10) | (12, 8) |
| **P1: A1** | (-6, 14) | (4, 4) |

**For Player 2 (Me):**
*   If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 8. **Choose A0.**
*   If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 14, A1 gives 4. **Choose A0.**
*   *Strategy A0 is strictly dominant for Player 2.*

**For Player 1 (Opponent):**
*   If P2 plays A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives -6. **Choose A0.**
*   If P2 plays A1: A0 gives 12, A1 gives 4. **Choose A0.**
*   *Strategy A0 is strictly dominant for Player 1.*

Both players have a strictly dominant strategy to play A0. The resulting Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), yielding 10 points for both players. Choosing any other probability distribution would lower the expected payoff given the opponent's incentive to play A0.

Under **C2 (no transfers)**, Player 2 has a strictly dominant action **A1** (20>10 if you play A0; 4>2 if you play A1). So the outcome is **(A1, A1)**, giving you **4**.

Under **C1 (A0 gets +11 paid by the other player)**, the transfer changes your payoffs to:
- (A0,A0): 10 (11 cancels out)
- (A0,A1): 0 + 11 = **11**
- (A1,A0): 6 − 11 = **-5**
- (A1,A1): **4**

So **A0 strictly dominates** for you. Symmetrically, **A0 strictly dominates** for Player 2 as well, leading to **(A0, A0)** with payoff **10** for you.

Since C1 is strictly better for you than C2, and approving C2 could only introduce a chance that C2 gets selected in a tie, you should **approve only C1**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

1) Incorporate the contract as a transfer:
- If I choose **A0**, I **gain +5** (paid by the other player).
- If the other player chooses **A0**, I **lose 5** (I pay them).
- Choosing **A1** causes no transfers.

2) Compute my **contract-adjusted payoffs**:

- (A0, A0): base 10 +5 −5 = **10**
- (A0, A1): base 0 +5 −0 = **5**
- (A1, A0): base 6 +0 −5 = **1**
- (A1, A1): base 4 +0 −0 = **4**

So my payoff matrix becomes:

|           | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | 10    | 5     |
| **P1 A1** | 1     | 4     |

3) Compare actions:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives 1 → A0 better.
- If P2 plays A1: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives 4 → A0 better.

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for me, meaning the best strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

My (Player 2) payoff matrix in the base game:
```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Me (P2)  A0     10      2
         A1     20      4
```

For me without contract:
- If Player 1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If Player 1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 2)
- **A1 strictly dominates A0 for me**

Player 1's payoff matrix:
```
                Me (P2)
                A0      A1
Player 1  A0    10      0
          A1    6       4
```

Given I'll play A1 (dominant strategy), Player 1 will choose A1 (4 > 0).

**Without contract outcome: Both play A1 → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- Playing A0: receive +11 points (paid by other player)
- Playing A1: no payment either way

My payoff matrix with contract:
```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Me (P2)  A0     10      13  (base + my bonus - their bonus)
         A1     9       4   (base - their bonus)
```

Calculation:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 11 - 11 = 10
- (A0, A1): 2 + 11 - 0 = 13
- (A1, A0): 20 + 0 - 11 = 9
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4

For me with contract:
- If Player 1 plays A0: I prefer A0 (10 > 9)
- If Player 1 plays A1: I prefer A0 (13 > 4)
- **A0 strictly dominates A1 for me**

Similarly, A0 becomes strictly dominant for Player 1 as well.

**With contract outcome: Both play A0 → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- Without contract: 4 points
- With contract: 10 points

The contract makes both players strictly better off (10 > 4). This is a Pareto improvement. Since Player 1 proposed it, they will likely sign too.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

As Player 2, my payoff matrix is:
```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0      10         2
P2: A1      20         4
```

Player 1's payoff matrix is:
```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0      10         6
P2: A1       0         4
```

## Step 2: Find the base game equilibrium

For me (Player 2):
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 2)
- **A1 strictly dominates A0**

For Player 1:
- If I play A0: P1 prefers A0 (10 > 6)
- If I play A1: P1 prefers A1 (4 > 0)

Nash equilibrium: **(A1, A1) → I get 4 points, P1 gets 4 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1 adds: +11 for choosing A0 (paid by opponent)

Modified payoffs for me:
```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0      10        13
P2: A1       9         4
```

Modified payoffs for P1:
```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0      10        -5
P2: A1      11         4
```

Now A0 strictly dominates A1 for me (10 > 9 when P1 plays A0; 13 > 4 when P1 plays A1).
And A0 strictly dominates A1 for P1 (10 > -5 when I play A0; 11 > 4 when I play A1).

Contract 1 equilibrium: **(A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2 adds: -10 payment for choosing A1 (paid to opponent)

Modified payoffs for me:
```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0      10        12
P2: A1      10         4
```

Modified payoffs for P1:
```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0      10        -4
P2: A1      10         4
```

A0 weakly/strictly dominates A1 for me.
A0 strictly dominates A1 for P1.

Contract 2 equilibrium: **(A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- **No contract**: 4 points
- **Contract 1**: 10 points
- **Contract 2**: 10 points

Both contracts give me the same improved payoff (10 vs 4), converting what would be a prisoner's dilemma situation into cooperative play. I should approve both contracts to maximize the chance that at least one is implemented.

The contract states that choosing A0 gives +11 points (paid by the other player).

Let me calculate my actual payoffs with the contract:

**Case 1: (Me: A0, Other: A0)**
- Base: 10 points
- I chose A0: +11 points
- Other chose A0: -11 points (I pay them)
- Total: 10 + 11 - 11 = **10 points**

**Case 2: (Me: A1, Other: A0)**
- Base: 20 points
- I chose A1: 0 contract payment
- Other chose A0: -11 points (I pay them)
- Total: 20 - 11 = **9 points**

**Case 3: (Me: A0, Other: A1)**
- Base: 2 points
- I chose A0: +11 points
- Other chose A1: 0 contract payment
- Total: 2 + 11 = **13 points**

**Case 4: (Me: A1, Other: A1)**
- Base: 4 points
- No contract payments
- Total: **4 points**

## Step 3: Analyze the payoff matrix

```
              Other: A0    Other: A1
My A0:           10           13
My A1:            9            4
```

## Step 4: Find the optimal strategy

Comparing my payoffs:
- If Other plays A0: 10 (from A0) > 9 (from A1)
- If Other plays A1: 13 (from A0) > 4 (from A1)

**A0 strictly dominates A1** regardless of what the other player does!

## Conclusion

Since A0 gives me a higher payoff in every possible scenario, I should play A0 with 100% probability.

Let me analyze this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the baseline game (without contract)

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:

|  | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Player 2: A0** | 10 | 2 |
| **Player 2: A1** | 20 | 4 |

Without the contract:
- A1 strictly dominates A0 for me (20 > 10 when P1 plays A0; 4 > 2 when P1 plays A1)
- So I would always choose A1

For Player 1, if they expect me to play A1:
- They get 0 if they play A0
- They get 4 if they play A1
- So they'd choose A1

**Nash equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze the game with the contract

The contract adds: If a player chooses A1, they pay 10 points to the other player.

New payoff matrix for me (Player 2):

|  | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Player 2: A0** | 10 (no penalties) | 2 + 10 = **12** (P1 pays me) |
| **Player 2: A1** | 20 - 10 = **10** (I pay P1) | 4 - 10 + 10 = **4** (we both pay each other) |

For Player 1 with contract:

|  | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Player 1: A0** | 10 | 0 + 10 = **10** (I pay them) |
| **Player 1: A1** | 6 - 10 = **-4** (they pay me) | 4 |

## Step 3: Find Nash equilibrium with contract

For me (Player 2):
- If P1 plays A0: I get 10 with either action
- If P1 plays A1: I get 12 with A0 vs 4 with A1 → **A0 is better**

For Player 1:
- If I play A0: P1 gets 10 with A0 vs -4 with A1 → **A0 is better**
- If I play A1: P1 gets 10 with A0 vs 4 with A1 → **A0 is better**

Player 1 should always play A0, and given that, I should play A0.

**Nash equilibrium with contract: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- Without contract: **4 points**
- With contract: **10 points**

The contract increases my payoff by 150% at equilibrium. The contract transforms the game from a prisoner's dilemma-like situation into one where cooperation (both playing A0) is the rational choice.

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game

We are playing a simultaneous-move game where:
- Players choose actions: A0 or A1.
- We are **Player 2** (the second player in the payoff table).
- The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**               | (10,10)  | (20,0)   |
| **A1**               | (2,6)    | (4,4)    |

> Note: Since you are Player 2, your payoffs are the second number in each pair.

So from your perspective:
- If you play A0:
  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 10
  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 6
- If you play A1:
  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 0
  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 4

---

### Step 2: Analyze Nash Equilibrium in the Base Game (No Contracts)

We are trying to predict behavior to evaluate contracts. Let’s find the Nash equilibria.

Check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:

1. **(A0, A0)**:
   - P1: If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0), 2 (A1) → 10 > 2 → P1 won’t deviate
   - P2: If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 (A0), 0 (A1) → 10 > 0 → P2 won’t deviate
   - → **Nash equilibrium**

2. **(A1, A1)**:
   - P1: If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4 (A1), 20 (A0) → 20 > 4 → P1 will deviate
   - Not NE

3. **(A0, A1)**:
   - P1: Gets 2 (A0), 0 (A1) → 2 > 0 → P1 will not deviate?
   - Wait: if P2 plays A1, P1 is better off playing A0 (2) than A1 (4)? No: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 → P1 will want to switch from A0 to A1.
   - So P1 has incentive to deviate → not NE

4. **(A1, A0)**:
   - P2: If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 6 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → 6 > 4 → P2 won’t deviate
   - P1: If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → 20 > 10 → P1 will deviate
   - Not a NE

So **only pure NE is (A0, A0)**.

But are there mixed strategies?

Let’s find the mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let:
- P1 play A0 with probability p
- P2 play A0 with probability q

We assume both players are rational and will mix only if indifferent.

**P2’s best response to P1's mixed strategy:**

P2's expected payoff from playing:
- A0: p×10 + (1-p)×6 = 10p + 6 - 6p = 4p + 6
- A1: p×0 + (1-p)×4 = 4 - 4p

Set them equal to find indifference (mixed strategy NE):
4p + 6 = 4 - 4p → 8p = -2 → p = -0.25 → impossible

So P2 has **no** mixed strategy NE — their best response is always one action.

Instead, try P1’s indifference.

P1’s payoff from:
- A0: q×10 + (1-q)×2 = 10q + 2 - 2q = 8q + 2
- A1: q×20 + (1-q)×4 = 20q + 4 - 4q = 16q + 4

Set equal:
8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → -8q = 2 → q = -0.25 → impossible

So no mixed strategy NE where both mix.

Thus, the only Nash equilibrium is **(A0, A0)**.

So in the base game (no contracts), rational players will likely play A0, A0.

---

### Step 3: Understand the Contract Mechanism

A **contract** can be agreed upon if both players approve (via approval voting, not mutual consent — just approval).

- Contracts define **additional payments** that are paid by one player to another based on their action.
- Payments are **drawn equally from the other player** in the case of the first contract.

There are **two proposals**:

---

#### Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+11 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

Let’s interpret:
- Any player who plays A0 gets +11 points.
- That +11 comes **from** the other player → so the other player loses 11 points.
- This happens **regardless of the other player’s action**.
- It's **part of the total payoff**.

So if you play A0, you get +11, and the other player loses 11 **regardless of what they do**.

But note: the payment is **drawn equally from the other player** — meaning: if both play A0, each gets +11, but both also lose 11 from the other? That would mean **each player gains 11 and loses 11**, so net zero?

Wait — the wording:

> "drawn equally from the other players" — plural?

But there’s only one other player.

Likely means: the +11 is drawn **from the other player** (i.e., the other player pays it).

So:
- If you play A0, you get +11, and the other player loses 11.

But if **both** play A0:
- You gain +11, but you also lose 11 (because the other player played A0 and gets +11, so you must pay that).
- So net for you: +11 (from your action) - 11 (from their A0) = 0.

Wait — this seems ambiguous.

Let’s clarify the rule: “drawn equally from the other players”.

This likely means: for each player who plays A0, the **cost of the +11** is borne **by the other player**.

So if only **you** play A0: you get +11, the other player loses 11.

If **you both** play A0: you both get +11, but the other player loses 11 — so for each of you, your net effect is:
- You get +11 (from your own A0) but pay -11 (from their A0) → net 0.

If **only** the other player plays A0: you get nothing, but lose 11.

So effectively:
- If you play A0, you gain +11
- But if the other player plays A0, you lose 11

So **your net gain from A0** depends on what the other plays.

Let’s define **net effect of your action**.

Suppose you play A0:
- You get +11 (bonus)
- But if the other plays A0, you lose 11 → so net: if other plays A0: 11 - 11 = 0; if other plays A1: 11 - 0 = 11

But wait — if the other plays A1, they don't get the bonus, so you don’t lose anything.

So:
- If you play A0 and the other plays A0: you get +11, lose 11 → net 0
- If you play A0 and the other plays A1: you get +11, no loss → net +11

Similarly, if you play A1:
- You get nothing from bonus
- You only lose money if the other player plays A0 → but if they play A0, they get +11, so you must lose 11 → so if other plays A0 → you lose 11

So your net payoff from a contract is **original payoff** + **bonus/punishment from contract**.

Let’s build the **full payoff matrix under C1**, from **your perspective (Player 2)**.

---

### Step 4: Evaluate C1 (Player 1’s Proposals)

Original payoffs (Player 2’s) were:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

Now, under C1:
- You (Player 2) get +11 if you play A0
- You lose 11 if the other (Player 1) plays A0

So new total payoff for you (Player 2) is:
> Original payoff + 11×[you play A0] - 11×[Player 1 plays A0]

Let’s compute each cell:

1. (A0, A0) → you play A0, Player 1 plays A0
   - Original: 10
   - +11 (your A0)
   - -11 (P1's A0)
   - → 10 + 11 - 11 = **10**

2. (A1, A0) → you play A1, P1 plays A0
   - Original: 0
   - +0 (you don't play A0)
   - -11 (P1's A0)
   - → 0 - 11 = **-11**

3. (A0, A1) → you play A0, P1 plays A1
   - Original: 6
   - +11 (your A0)
   - -0 (P1 not A0)
   - → 6 + 11 = **17**

4. (A1, A1) → you play A1, P1 plays A1
   - Original: 4
   - +0
   - -0
   - → 4

So the **new payoff matrix for you (Player 2)** under C1:
| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 10       | -11      |
| **A1**  | 17       | 4        |

Now analyze this matrix.

What should you do?

If Player 1 plays A0:
- You: A0 → 10, A1 → -11 → choose A0

If Player 1 plays A1:
- You: A0 → 17, A1 → 4 → choose A0

So **no matter what Player 1 does, your best response is to play A0**

So A0 is **dominant** for you under C1.

Therefore, you will play A0.

Now, what will Player 1 do?

Let’s compute **Player 1’s** payoff under C1.

For P1:
- +11 if P1 plays A0
- -11 if P2 plays A0

So P1's payoff = original + 11×[P1 plays A0] - 11×[P2 plays A0]

Original payoffs (P1):
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A1,A0): 2
- (A0,A1): 20
- (A1,A1): 4

Now with C1 adjustments:

1. (A0, A0): 10 + 11 - 11 = 10
2. (A1, A0): 2 + 0 - 11 = -9
3. (A0, A1): 20 + 11 - 0 = 31
4. (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4

So P1’s new matrix:
| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 10       | -9       |
| **A1**  | 31       | 4        |

P1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 → 10, A1 → 31 → choose A1
- If P2 plays A1: A0 → -9, A1 → 4 → choose A1

So **A1 is dominant** for Player 1.

But you (Player 2) will play A0 (as dominant), and Player 1 will play A1 (as dominant).

So **expected outcome: (A1, A0)** → you play A0, P1 plays A1.

Your payoff in that case: **17** (from above)

But wait — P1 is using their dominant strategy A1, and you are using A0.

So outcome: A1 for P1, A0 for you → (A0, A1) → your payoff = **17**

But is this stable?

Yes — both are best responding.

So under C1, you expect to get **17 points**.

Previously, in base game, you got **10** (from (A0,A0) equilibrium).
So C1 is better for you → **you should approve C1**.

But let’s not jump yet.

Wait — **could there be a coordination failure?** But the contract is binding once approved, and players act strategically.

We are analyzing the **equilibrium under the contract**, which is well-defined.

So yes: with C1, Nash outcome is (A1,A0) → you get 17

But remember — **you are playing as Player 2**, and **you want to maximize your own points**.

So 17 > 10 → **C1 is good for you**

Now, what about **risk**? Is there a chance you get less?

No — in rational play, outcome is (A1,A0), payoff = 17 for you in a deterministic equilibrium (mixed or pure).

Actually, both players have dominant strategies → pure Nash: (A1, A0)

So **you get 17 for sure**.

So C1 is good for you.

Now, **why would Player 1 propose it?** Because under C1, if P1 plays A1, they get 31 when you play A0, which is great — and they expect you to play A0.

So C1 is a good deal for P1, and also **good for you** (get 17 > 10).

So although P1 is proposing it, it's beneficial for you too.

So **approve C1**.

---

### Step 5: Evaluate C2 (Proposed by Player 2)

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So **no changes to payoffs**.

This is **the same as the original game**.

So payoffs unchanged.

Then, as before, the only Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) → you get **10 points**.

So no benefit.

But by approving C2, you are not losing anything — just keeping the status quo.

But here’s the key: **if you vote for C2, but also approve C1, and C1 gets more approvals, C1 wins**.

But if C1 doesn't get enough approvals, maybe C2 wins.

But your goal is to **maximize your expected points**.

You don’t care about the contract winning unless it actually gets implemented.

But the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random** from those with **maximum number of approvals**.

So if multiple contracts tie for most approvals, one is picked at random.

To maximize your expected payoff, you want to **maximize the probability that the contract which maximizes your payoff is selected**.

So strategy:
- You should approve **any contract that gives you >= 10** (base case), and especially those with higher value.
- But avoid approving contracts that give you less unless they help you get higher one.

So compare:
- C1: gives you **17** in equilibrium
- C2: gives you **10**

So **C1 is much better**.

Now, **if you approve only C1**, and C2 gets no approvals, then C1 wins (only one contract with max approvals — itself).

So you get 17.

If you approve **both**, and **someone else approves both**, then both have 2 approvals (if only 2 players), so max is 2, and C1 or C2 chosen at random (50% each).

Then your **expected payoff**:
- 0.5 × 17 + 0.5 × 10 = 8.5 + 5 = 13.5 < 17

So **worse than if you approve only C1**.

Therefore, **you should not approve C2** — because approving it reduces your expected payoff from 17 to 13.5, if C2 is tied for most approvals.

But what if no one else approves C1?

You have no control over others, but you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

So your rational strategy:
- Approve C1 → you get 17 **if C1 is selected**
- If C1 is not selected, you get 10 (if C2 is selected), or something else (but no other contracts)

But since only C1 and C2 are proposed, and C1 gives better payoff.

Now, **if you approve only C1**, and no one else approves anything, C1 has 1, C2 has 0 → C1 wins → you get 17.

If you approve C1 and C2, and others approve only C1, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 → C1 wins → you get 17.

If others approve both, and you approve both → both have same approvals → random → 50% 17, 50% 10 →

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry


Your previous response was:
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game

We are playing a simultaneous-move game where:
- Players choose actions: A0 or A1.
- We are **Player 2** (the second player in the payoff table).
- The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**               | (10,10)  | (20,0)   |
| **A1**               | (2,6)    | (4,4)    |

> Note: Since you are Player 2, your payoffs are the second number in each pair.

So from your perspective:
- If you play A0:
  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 10
  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 6
- If you play A1:
  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 0
  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 4

---

### Step 2: Analyze Nash Equilibrium in the Base Game (No Contracts)

We are trying to predict behavior to evaluate contracts. Let’s find the Nash equilibria.

Check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:

1. **(A0, A0)**:
   - P1: If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0), 2 (A1) → 10 > 2 → P1 won’t deviate
   - P2: If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 (A0), 0 (A1) → 10 > 0 → P2 won’t deviate
   - → **Nash equilibrium**

2. **(A1, A1)**:
   - P1: If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4 (A1), 20 (A0) → 20 > 4 → P1 will deviate
   - Not NE

3. **(A0, A1)**:
   - P1: Gets 2 (A0), 0 (A1) → 2 > 0 → P1 will not deviate?
   - Wait: if P2 plays A1, P1 is better off playing A0 (2) than A1 (4)? No: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 → P1 will want to switch from A0 to A1.
   - So P1 has incentive to deviate → not NE

4. **(A1, A0)**:
   - P2: If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 6 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → 6 > 4 → P2 won’t deviate
   - P1: If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → 20 > 10 → P1 will deviate
   - Not a NE

So **only pure NE is (A0, A0)**.

But are there mixed strategies?

Let’s find the mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let:
- P1 play A0 with probability p
- P2 play A0 with probability q

We assume both players are rational and will mix only if indifferent.

**P2’s best response to P1's mixed strategy:**

P2's expected payoff from playing:
- A0: p×10 + (1-p)×6 = 10p + 6 - 6p = 4p + 6
- A1: p×0 + (1-p)×4 = 4 - 4p

Set them equal to find indifference (mixed strategy NE):
4p + 6 = 4 - 4p → 8p = -2 → p = -0.25 → impossible

So P2 has **no** mixed strategy NE — their best response is always one action.

Instead, try P1’s indifference.

P1’s payoff from:
- A0: q×10 + (1-q)×2 = 10q + 2 - 2q = 8q + 2
- A1: q×20 + (1-q)×4 = 20q + 4 - 4q = 16q + 4

Set equal:
8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → -8q = 2 → q = -0.25 → impossible

So no mixed strategy NE where both mix.

Thus, the only Nash equilibrium is **(A0, A0)**.

So in the base game (no contracts), rational players will likely play A0, A0.

---

### Step 3: Understand the Contract Mechanism

A **contract** can be agreed upon if both players approve (via approval voting, not mutual consent — just approval).

- Contracts define **additional payments** that are paid by one player to another based on their action.
- Payments are **drawn equally from the other player** in the case of the first contract.

There are **two proposals**:

---

#### Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+11 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

Let’s interpret:
- Any player who plays A0 gets +11 points.
- That +11 comes **from** the other player → so the other player loses 11 points.
- This happens **regardless of the other player’s action**.
- It's **part of the total payoff**.

So if you play A0, you get +11, and the other player loses 11 **regardless of what they do**.

But note: the payment is **drawn equally from the other player** — meaning: if both play A0, each gets +11, but both also lose 11 from the other? That would mean **each player gains 11 and loses 11**, so net zero?

Wait — the wording:

> "drawn equally from the other players" — plural?

But there’s only one other player.

Likely means: the +11 is drawn **from the other player** (i.e., the other player pays it).

So:
- If you play A0, you get +11, and the other player loses 11.

But if **both** play A0:
- You gain +11, but you also lose 11 (because the other player played A0 and gets +11, so you must pay that).
- So net for you: +11 (from your action) - 11 (from their A0) = 0.

Wait — this seems ambiguous.

Let’s clarify the rule: “drawn equally from the other players”.

This likely means: for each player who plays A0, the **cost of the +11** is borne **by the other player**.

So if only **you** play A0: you get +11, the other player loses 11.

If **you both** play A0: you both get +11, but the other player loses 11 — so for each of you, your net effect is:
- You get +11 (from your own A0) but pay -11 (from their A0) → net 0.

If **only** the other player plays A0: you get nothing, but lose 11.

So effectively:
- If you play A0, you gain +11
- But if the other player plays A0, you lose 11

So **your net gain from A0** depends on what the other plays.

Let’s define **net effect of your action**.

Suppose you play A0:
- You get +11 (bonus)
- But if the other plays A0, you lose 11 → so net: if other plays A0: 11 - 11 = 0; if other plays A1: 11 - 0 = 11

But wait — if the other plays A1, they don't get the bonus, so you don’t lose anything.

So:
- If you play A0 and the other plays A0: you get +11, lose 11 → net 0
- If you play A0 and the other plays A1: you get +11, no loss → net +11

Similarly, if you play A1:
- You get nothing from bonus
- You only lose money if the other player plays A0 → but if they play A0, they get +11, so you must lose 11 → so if other plays A0 → you lose 11

So your net payoff from a contract is **original payoff** + **bonus/punishment from contract**.

Let’s build the **full payoff matrix under C1**, from **your perspective (Player 2)**.

---

### Step 4: Evaluate C1 (Player 1’s Proposals)

Original payoffs (Player 2’s) were:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

Now, under C1:
- You (Player 2) get +11 if you play A0
- You lose 11 if the other (Player 1) plays A0

So new total payoff for you (Player 2) is:
> Original payoff + 11×[you play A0] - 11×[Player 1 plays A0]

Let’s compute each cell:

1. (A0, A0) → you play A0, Player 1 plays A0
   - Original: 10
   - +11 (your A0)
   - -11 (P1's A0)
   - → 10 + 11 - 11 = **10**

2. (A1, A0) → you play A1, P1 plays A0
   - Original: 0
   - +0 (you don't play A0)
   - -11 (P1's A0)
   - → 0 - 11 = **-11**

3. (A0, A1) → you play A0, P1 plays A1
   - Original: 6
   - +11 (your A0)
   - -0 (P1 not A0)
   - → 6 + 11 = **17**

4. (A1, A1) → you play A1, P1 plays A1
   - Original: 4
   - +0
   - -0
   - → 4

So the **new payoff matrix for you (Player 2)** under C1:
| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 10       | -11      |
| **A1**  | 17       | 4        |

Now analyze this matrix.

What should you do?

If Player 1 plays A0:
- You: A0 → 10, A1 → -11 → choose A0

If Player 1 plays A1:
- You: A0 → 17, A1 → 4 → choose A0

So **no matter what Player 1 does, your best response is to play A0**

So A0 is **dominant** for you under C1.

Therefore, you will play A0.

Now, what will Player 1 do?

Let’s compute **Player 1’s** payoff under C1.

For P1:
- +11 if P1 plays A0
- -11 if P2 plays A0

So P1's payoff = original + 11×[P1 plays A0] - 11×[P2 plays A0]

Original payoffs (P1):
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A1,A0): 2
- (A0,A1): 20
- (A1,A1): 4

Now with C1 adjustments:

1. (A0, A0): 10 + 11 - 11 = 10
2. (A1, A0): 2 + 0 - 11 = -9
3. (A0, A1): 20 + 11 - 0 = 31
4. (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4

So P1’s new matrix:
| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 10       | -9       |
| **A1**  | 31       | 4        |

P1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 → 10, A1 → 31 → choose A1
- If P2 plays A1: A0 → -9, A1 → 4 → choose A1

So **A1 is dominant** for Player 1.

But you (Player 2) will play A0 (as dominant), and Player 1 will play A1 (as dominant).

So **expected outcome: (A1, A0)** → you play A0, P1 plays A1.

Your payoff in that case: **17** (from above)

But wait — P1 is using their dominant strategy A1, and you are using A0.

So outcome: A1 for P1, A0 for you → (A0, A1) → your payoff = **17**

But is this stable?

Yes — both are best responding.

So under C1, you expect to get **17 points**.

Previously, in base game, you got **10** (from (A0,A0) equilibrium).
So C1 is better for you → **you should approve C1**.

But let’s not jump yet.

Wait — **could there be a coordination failure?** But the contract is binding once approved, and players act strategically.

We are analyzing the **equilibrium under the contract**, which is well-defined.

So yes: with C1, Nash outcome is (A1,A0) → you get 17

But remember — **you are playing as Player 2**, and **you want to maximize your own points**.

So 17 > 10 → **C1 is good for you**

Now, what about **risk**? Is there a chance you get less?

No — in rational play, outcome is (A1,A0), payoff = 17 for you in a deterministic equilibrium (mixed or pure).

Actually, both players have dominant strategies → pure Nash: (A1, A0)

So **you get 17 for sure**.

So C1 is good for you.

Now, **why would Player 1 propose it?** Because under C1, if P1 plays A1, they get 31 when you play A0, which is great — and they expect you to play A0.

So C1 is a good deal for P1, and also **good for you** (get 17 > 10).

So although P1 is proposing it, it's beneficial for you too.

So **approve C1**.

---

### Step 5: Evaluate C2 (Proposed by Player 2)

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So **no changes to payoffs**.

This is **the same as the original game**.

So payoffs unchanged.

Then, as before, the only Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) → you get **10 points**.

So no benefit.

But by approving C2, you are not losing anything — just keeping the status quo.

But here’s the key: **if you vote for C2, but also approve C1, and C1 gets more approvals, C1 wins**.

But if C1 doesn't get enough approvals, maybe C2 wins.

But your goal is to **maximize your expected points**.

You don’t care about the contract winning unless it actually gets implemented.

But the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random** from those with **maximum number of approvals**.

So if multiple contracts tie for most approvals, one is picked at random.

To maximize your expected payoff, you want to **maximize the probability that the contract which maximizes your payoff is selected**.

So strategy:
- You should approve **any contract that gives you >= 10** (base case), and especially those with higher value.
- But avoid approving contracts that give you less unless they help you get higher one.

So compare:
- C1: gives you **17** in equilibrium
- C2: gives you **10**

So **C1 is much better**.

Now, **if you approve only C1**, and C2 gets no approvals, then C1 wins (only one contract with max approvals — itself).

So you get 17.

If you approve **both**, and **someone else approves both**, then both have 2 approvals (if only 2 players), so max is 2, and C1 or C2 chosen at random (50% each).

Then your **expected payoff**:
- 0.5 × 17 + 0.5 × 10 = 8.5 + 5 = 13.5 < 17

So **worse than if you approve only C1**.

Therefore, **you should not approve C2** — because approving it reduces your expected payoff from 17 to 13.5, if C2 is tied for most approvals.

But what if no one else approves C1?

You have no control over others, but you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

So your rational strategy:
- Approve C1 → you get 17 **if C1 is selected**
- If C1 is not selected, you get 10 (if C2 is selected), or something else (but no other contracts)

But since only C1 and C2 are proposed, and C1 gives better payoff.

Now, **if you approve only C1**, and no one else approves anything, C1 has 1, C2 has 0 → C1 wins → you get 17.

If you approve C1 and C2, and others approve only C1, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 → C1 wins → you get 17.

If others approve both, and you approve both → both have same approvals → random → 50% 17, 50% 10 →

That would mean **each player gains 11 and loses 11**, so net zero?\n\nWait — the wording:\n\n> "drawn equally from the other players" — plural?\n\nBut there’s only one other player.\n\nLikely means: the +11 is drawn **from the other player** (i.e., the other player pays it).\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0, you get +11, and the other player loses 11.\n\nBut if **both** play A0:\n- You gain +11, but you also lose 11 (because the other player played A0 and gets +11, so you must pay that).\n- So net for you: +11 (from your action) - 11 (from their A0) = 0.\n\nWait — this seems ambiguous.\n\nLet’s clarify the rule: “drawn equally from the other players”.\n\nThis likely means: for each player who plays A0, the **cost of the +11** is borne **by the other player**.\n\nSo if only **you** play A0: you get +11, the other player loses 11.\n\nIf **you both** play A0: you both get +11, but the other player loses 11 — so for each of you, your net effect is:\n- You get +11 (from your own A0) but pay -11 (from their A0) → net 0.\n\nIf **only** the other player plays A0: you get nothing, but lose 11.\n\nSo effectively:\n- If you play A0, you gain +11\n- But if the other player plays A0, you lose 11\n\nSo **your net gain from A0** depends on what the other plays.\n\nLet’s define **net effect of your action**.\n\nSuppose you play A0:\n- You get +11 (bonus)\n- But if the other plays A0, you lose 11 → so net: if other plays A0: 11 - 11 = 0; if other plays A1: 11 - 0 = 11\n\nBut wait — if the other plays A1, they don\'t get the bonus, so you don’t lose anything.\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0 and the other plays A0: you get +11, lose 11 → net 0\n- If you play A0 and the other plays A1: you get +11, no loss → net +11\n\nSimilarly, if you play A1:\n- You get nothing from bonus\n- You only lose money if the other player plays A0 → but if they play A0, they get +11, so you must lose 11 → so if other plays A0 → you lose 11\n\nSo your net payoff from a contract is **original payoff** + **bonus/punishment from contract**.\n\nLet’s build the **full payoff matrix under C1**, from **your perspective (Player 2)**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate C1 (Player 1’s Proposals)\n\nOriginal payoffs (Player 2’s) were:\n- (A0, A0): 10\n- (A1, A0): 0\n- (A0, A1): 6\n- (A1, A1): 4\n\nNow, under C1:\n- You (Player 2) get +11 if you play A0\n- You lose 11 if the other (Player 1) plays A0\n\nSo new total payoff for you (Player 2) is:\n> Original payoff + 11×[you play A0] - 11×[Player 1 plays A0]\n\nLet’s compute each cell:\n\n1. (A0, A0) → you play A0, Player 1 plays A0\n   - Original: 10\n   - +11 (your A0)\n   - -11 (P1\'s A0)\n   - → 10 + 11 - 11 = **10**\n\n2. (A1, A0) → you play A1, P1 plays A0\n   - Original: 0\n   - +0 (you don\'t play A0)\n   - -11 (P1\'s A0)\n   - → 0 - 11 = **-11**\n\n3. (A0, A1) → you play A0, P1 plays A1\n   - Original: 6\n   - +11 (your A0)\n   - -0 (P1 not A0)\n   - → 6 + 11 = **17**\n\n4. (A1, A1) → you play A1, P1 plays A1\n   - Original: 4\n   - +0\n   - -0\n   - → 4\n\nSo the **new payoff matrix for you (Player 2)** under C1:\n| P1 \\ P2 | A0       | A1       |\n|---------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**  | 10       | -11      |\n| **A1**  | 17       | 4        |\n\nNow analyze this matrix.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nIf Player 1 plays A0:\n- You: A0 → 10, A1 → -11 → choose A0\n\nIf Player 1 plays A1:\n- You: A0 → 17, A1 → 4 → choose A0\n\nSo **no matter what Player 1 does, your best response is to play A0**\n\nSo A0 is **dominant** for you under C1.\n\nTherefore, you will play A0.\n\nNow, what will Player 1 do?\n\nLet’s compute **Player 1’s** payoff under C1.\n\nFor P1:\n- +11 if P1 plays A0\n- -11 if P2 plays A0\n\nSo P1\'s payoff = original + 11×[P1 plays A0] - 11×[P2 plays A0]\n\nOriginal payoffs (P1):\n- (A0,A0): 10\n- (A1,A0): 2\n- (A0,A1): 20\n- (A1,A1): 4\n\nNow with C1 adjustments:\n\n1. (A0, A0): 10 + 11 - 11 = 10\n2. (A1, A0): 2 + 0 - 11 = -9\n3. (A0, A1): 20 + 11 - 0 = 31\n4. (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4\n\nSo P1’s new matrix:\n| P1 \\ P2 | A0       | A1       |\n|---------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**  | 10       | -9       |\n| **A1**  | 31       | 4        |\n\nP1’s best response:\n- If P2 plays A0: A0 → 10, A1 → 31 → choose A1\n- If P2 plays A1: A0 → -9, A1 → 4 → choose A1\n\nSo **A1 is dominant** for Player 1.\n\nBut you (Player 2) will play A0 (as dominant), and Player 1 will play A1 (as dominant).\n\nSo **expected outcome: (A1, A0)** → you play A0, P1 plays A1.\n\nYour payoff in that case: **17** (from above)\n\nBut wait — P1 is using their dominant strategy A1, and you are using A0.\n\nSo outcome: A1 for P1, A0 for you → (A0, A1) → your payoff = **17**\n\nBut is this stable?\n\nYes — both are best responding.\n\nSo under C1, you expect to get **17 points**.\n\nPreviously, in base game, you got **10** (from (A0,A0) equilibrium).\nSo C1 is better for you → **you should approve C1**.\n\nBut let’s not jump yet.\n\nWait — **could there be a coordination failure?** But the contract is binding once approved, and players act strategically.\n\nWe are analyzing the **equilibrium under the contract**, which is well-defined.\n\nSo yes: with C1, Nash outcome is (A1,A0) → you get 17\n\nBut remember — **you are playing as Player 2**, and **you want to maximize your own points**.\n\nSo 17 > 10 → **C1 is good for you**\n\nNow, what about **risk**? Is there a chance you get less?\n\nNo — in rational play, outcome is (A1,A0), payoff = 17 for you in a deterministic equilibrium (mixed or pure).\n\nActually, both players have dominant strategies → pure Nash: (A1, A0)\n\nSo **you get 17 for sure**.\n\nSo C1 is good for you.\n\nNow, **why would Player 1 propose it?** Because under C1, if P1 plays A1, they get 31 when you play A0, which is great — and they expect you to play A0.\n\nSo C1 is a good deal for P1, and also **good for you** (get 17 > 10).\n\nSo although P1 is proposing it, it\'s beneficial for you too.\n\nSo **approve C1**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate C2 (Proposed by Player 2)\n\n> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.\n> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.\n\nSo **no changes to payoffs**.\n\nThis is **the same as the original game**.\n\nSo payoffs unchanged.\n\nThen, as before, the only Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) → you get **10 points**.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nBut by approving C2, you are not losing anything — just keeping the status quo.\n\nBut here’s the key: **if you vote for C2, but also approve C1, and C1 gets more approvals, C1 wins**.\n\nBut if C1 doesn\'t get enough approvals, maybe C2 wins.\n\nBut your goal is to **maximize your expected points**.\n\nYou don’t care about the contract winning unless it actually gets implemented.\n\nBut the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random** from those with **maximum number of approvals**.\n\nSo if multiple contracts tie for most approvals, one is picked at random.\n\nTo maximize your expected payoff, you want to **maximize the probability that the contract which maximizes your payoff is selected**.\n\nSo strategy:\n- You should approve **any contract that gives you >= 10** (base case), and especially those with higher value.\n- But avoid approving contracts that give you less unless they help you get higher one.\n\nSo compare:\n- C1: gives you **17** in equilibrium\n- C2: gives you **10**\n\nSo **C1 is much better**.\n\nNow, **if you approve only C1**, and C2 gets no approvals, then C1 wins (only one contract with max approvals — itself).\n\nSo you get 17.\n\nIf you approve **both**, and **someone else approves both**, then both have 2 approvals (if only 2 players), so max is 2, and C1 or C2 chosen at random (50% each).\n\nThen your **expected payoff**:\n- 0.5 × 17 + 0.5 × 10 = 8.5 + 5 = 13.5 < 17\n\nSo **worse than if you approve only C1**.\n\nTherefore, **you should not approve C2** — because approving it reduces your expected payoff from 17 to 13.5, if C2 is tied for most approvals.\n\nBut what if no one else approves C1?\n\nYou have no control over others, but you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.\n\nSo your rational strategy:\n- Approve C1 → you get 17 **if C1 is selected**\n- If C1 is not selected, you get 10 (if C2 is selected), or something else (but no other contracts)\n\nBut since only C1 and C2 are proposed, and C1 gives better payoff.\n\nNow, **if you approve only C1**, and no one else approves anything, C1 has 1, C2 has 0 → C1 wins → you get 17.\n\nIf you approve C1 and C2, and others approve only C1, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 → C1 wins → you get 17.\n\nIf others approve both, and you approve both → both have same approvals → random → 50% 17, 50% 10 → '

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoffs with the contract

The original payoffs need to be adjusted for the contract penalty: choosing A1 costs 10 points paid to the other player.

**Modified payoff matrix (my perspective as Player 2):**

| My Action | Other's A0 | Other's A1 |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **A0**    | 10         | 12         |
| **A1**    | 10         | 4          |

Let me verify each case:
- (A0, A0): Base 10, no penalties → **10**
- (A1, A0): Base 20, I pay 10 → **10**
- (A0, A1): Base 2, I receive 10 from other → **12**
- (A1, A1): Base 4, I pay 10 but receive 10 → **4**

## Step 2: Analyze best responses

**If the other player chooses A0:**
- My payoff from A0: 10
- My payoff from A1: 10
- I'm indifferent (but A0 is safer)

**If the other player chooses A1:**
- My payoff from A0: 12
- My payoff from A1: 4
- A0 is strictly better

## Step 3: Check for dominant strategies

A0 weakly dominates A1 for me (it's at least as good, and sometimes strictly better).

From the other player's perspective, they would also prefer A0 (they get 10 vs -4 or 4 if they deviate to A1).

## Step 4: Find Nash equilibrium

The Nash equilibrium is both players choosing A0, yielding (10, 10).

This contract successfully transforms what was originally a Prisoner's Dilemma into a situation where mutual cooperation (A0, A0) is the rational outcome.

## Conclusion

The optimal strategy is to play A0 with certainty.

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)**

We are Player 2. The payoff matrix (from Player 2’s perspective) is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0          | A1          |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **A0**               | 10          | 2           |
| **A1**               | 20          | 4           |

So, for Player 2:
- If Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Choose A0 → 10 points
  - Choose A1 → 20 points → strictly better
- If Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Choose A0 → 2 points
  - Choose A1 → 4 points → still better

So **A1 dominates A0** for Player 2 in the base game.

Wait – actually, let’s be careful.

Player 2’s payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

So:
- When Player 1 plays A0 → A1 gives 20 > 10 → A1 better
- When Player 1 plays A1 → A1 gives 4 > 2 → A1 better

So no matter what Player 1 does, A1 gives Player 2 a higher payoff.

→ So **A1 is strictly dominant for Player 2** in the base game.

Similarly, check Player 1:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

So:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → Player 1 prefers A0 (10 > 0)
- If Player 2 plays A1 → Player 1 prefers A1 (4 > 6)? No — 6 > 4 → so A0 is better

So:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → Player 1 prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1 → Player 1 prefers A0 (6 vs 4)

So A0 is **weakly dominant** for Player 1.

Therefore, in the base game, if both act rationally:
- Player 1 will choose A0 (because it gives 10 vs 0 when P2 plays A0; and 6 vs 4 when P2 plays A1)
- Player 2 will choose A1 (strictly better regardless of P1)

→ Expected outcome: (A1, A0) → Player 2 gets 20 points, Player 1 gets 0.

But now we have a **contract**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract, proposed by Player 1, says:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other player.

Important: "Drawn equally from the other players" — so if **you** choose A0, you get +11, and **the other player** loses 11.

Also, **if you choose A1, no additional payments.**

So the contract:
- Adds +11 to your payoff **if you play A0**
- Subtracts 11 from the opponent's payoff **if you play A0**
- No effect for A1.

This is a **transfer from the other player to you**, if you play A0.

Note: The contract only applies **if both players sign it**. If not, it doesn’t activate.

We are deciding whether to **sign** it.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the effect of the contract on payoffs**

Assume **both** players sign the contract.

Now, the payoffs change.

Let’s compute the **new payoffs** for each outcome, **in addition to the base payoffs**:

| Action (P2 \ P1) | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)**      | +11 (to P2), -11 (from P1) | +11 (to P2), -11 (from P1) |
| **A1 (P2)**      | 0 | 0 |

So the **total payoff to Player 2** becomes:

| P2 \ P1 | A0         | A1         |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **A0** | 10 + 11 = 21 | 2 + 11 = 13 |
| **A1** | 20 + 0 = 20  | 4 + 0 = 4  |

So the matrix for Player 2, under contract, is:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 21 | 13 |
| A1     | 20 | 4  |

Now, can we find best responses for Player 2?

- If P1 chooses A0 → P2 prefers A0 (21 > 20)
- If P1 chooses A1 → P2 prefers A0 (13 > 4)

→ So **A0 is strictly dominant for Player 2** under the contract.

Now check Player 1’s incentives under contract:

Player 1’s base payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

Now, under contract:
- If P1 plays A0 → gains +11, and P2 loses 11
- If P1 plays A1 → no change

So P1’s **new payoffs**:

| P2 \ P1 | A0         | A1         |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **A0** | 10 + 11 = 21 | 6 + 0 = 6  |
| **A1** | 0 + 0 = 0    | 4 + 0 = 4  |

Wait — actually, it's better to frame it as:

When P1 chooses A0 → gains +11, so all payoffs for P1 where he plays A0 get +11.

So new payoffs for P1:

| P2 \ P1 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | 10 + 11 = 21 | 2 + 0 = 2? → no.

Wait! Critical point: **When a player chooses A0, they get +11 (and the other player loses 11).**

So payoffs are **not symmetric**.

Let's recompute entirely under contract.

**New total payoffs (Player 1):**
- (P1=A0, P2=A0): P1 gets 10 **+11** = 21; P2 gets 10 **-11** = -1? Wait — no.

**Clarify: "Drawn equally from the other players"**

The contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players."

There are only two players.

So if **Player 2 chooses A0**, then:
- P2 gains +11
- P1 loses 11

Similarly, if **Player 1 chooses A0**, then:
- P1 gains +11
- P2 loses 11

So the same rule applies to both.

Therefore, **for each player**, if they choose A0, they gain +11, and the other player loses 11.

So the **total effect** depends on who chooses A0.

Let’s rewrite the full payoff matrix under contract.

---

#### **Full Payoff Matrix under Contract (both players signed)**

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1)                 | A1 (P1)                 |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **A0** | P1: 10 + 11 = 21, P2: 10 - 11 = -1 | P1: 6 + 11 = 17? → No: P1 chose A1 → no +11, but P2 chose A0 → so P2 gets +11, P1 loses 11 |
| **A1** | P1: 0 + 0 = 0, P2: 20 - 11 = 9 | P1: 4 + 0 = 4, P2: 4 - 11 = -7 |

Wait — we need to apply the **contract rules** correctly.

- **If a player chooses A0**, they get +11, and the **other player loses 11**.
- If a player chooses A1, no effect.

So:

1. **(P1=A0, P2=A0)**:
   - P1 chose A0 → +11 → 10 + 11 = 21
   - P2 chose A0 → +11 → 10 + 11 = 21
   - But wait — here's the issue: **both players chose A0**, so **both gain +11**, and **each gets a -11 from the other**?

That would mean:
- Each gains +11 from choosing A0
- Each loses -11 from the other player doing A0

→ Net for each: +11 -11 = 0? That can't be.

Wait — this is ambiguous.

Let’s reread: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players."

There’s only one other player → so "equally" means the full 11 is taken from the other player.

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +11, and the **other player** loses 11.
- This is **independent of what the other player does**.

So if **both** choose A0:
- P1 gets +11 (from choosing A0), and loses 11 (because P2 chose A0)
- P2 gets +11 (from choosing A0), and loses 11 (because P1 chose A0)
- Net: each gets +11 -11 = 0

So **net effect of both choosing A0**: each receives +11 (for choosing A0), loses 11 (because the other chose A0), so net zero change? But only if the contract is in place.

Wait — no: the payment is **drawn from the other player**, so:
- When P2 chooses A0 → P2 receives +11 → this money comes from P1
- When P1 chooses A0 → P1 receives +11 → this money comes from P2

So if both choose A0, then:
- P2 gets +11 from the contract (because he played A0), but P1 gets +11 from the contract (because he played A0), so **they both get +11**, and each **pays 11** to the other.

So total for P2: base payoff +11 (from choosing A0) -11 (paid to P1 for P1 choosing A0) = base payoff

Similarly, P1: base +11 (from choosing A0) -11 (paid to P2) = base

So the net contract effect **cancels out** when both choose A0.

Similarly:
- If only one chooses A0: the one who chose A0 gains +11, the one who didn't gets -11
- If neither chooses A0 (both A1): no effect

So let’s recompute the **total payoffs under contract** correctly.

---

### **Correct Payoff Matrix under Contract**

#### Case 1: (P1=A0, P2=A0)
- P1: base 10, +11 (chose A0), -11 (P2 chose A0) → 10 +11 -11 = 10
- P2: base 10, +11 (chose A0), -11 (P1 chose A0) → 10 +11 -11 = 10

→ No net effect.

#### Case 2: (P1=A0, P2=A1)
- P1: base 0, +11 (chose A0), -11 (P2 chose A1 → P2 did **not** choose A0 → so **P1 does NOT get paid/charge**?)
Wait — **not**! The rule is:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11, drawn equally from the other players."

So it’s **based on your own action**, not the other.

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +11, and **the other player loses 11** (regardless of what they do)

→ So if **P1 chooses A0**, then **P1 gains +11**, **P2 loses 11**, **regardless of what P2 does**.

Similarly, if **P2 chooses A0**, then **P2 gains +11**, **P1 loses 11**.

So **independent**.

So now:

#### Case 1: P1=A0, P2=A0
- P1: base 10 +11 (for choosing A0) -11 (P2 chose A0 → so P1 loses 11) → 10
- P2: base 10 +11 (for choosing A0) -11 (P1 chose A0 → P2 loses 11) → 10

→ (10, 10)

#### Case 2: P1=A0, P2=A1
- P1: base 0 +11 (A0) -11 (P2 chose A0? No — P2 chose A1 → so **no loss to P1**) → P1 gets +11, P2 does not get +11, but P1’s choice causes P2 to lose 11
- Wait: **the loss is applied to the other player only if *you* choose A0**

So:
- Since P1 chose A0 → P2 loses 11 (because P2 is the other)
- Since P2 chose A1 → P2 does not gain +11
- P1 gets +11 because he chose A0

So:
- P1: base 0 +11 = 11
- P2: base 2 -11 = -9

#### Case 3: P1=A1, P2=A0
- P1: base 6 (from (A1,A0)) → P1 chose A1 → no +11, so gains 0 from contract
- But P2 chose A0 → so P1 must **lose 11** (because P2 chose A0)

→ P1: 6 -11 = -5
- P2: base 20 +11 = 31

#### Case 4: P1=A1, P2=A1
- No one chose A0 → no effects
- P1: base 4
- P2: base 4

So the **full payoff matrix under contract** (both players signed):

| P2 \ P1 | A0         | A1         |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **A0** | (10, 10)   | (31, -5)   |
| **A1** | (-9, 11)   | (4, 4)     |

Now let’s answer: **As Player 2, should I sign the contract?**

We are deciding whether to sign. The contract only activates if **both** sign.

So, if I sign, the game becomes the above matrix.

But Player 1 can also decide to sign or not.

We need to consider: **Would I want to sign, assuming both players act rationally?**

Let’s analyze from **Player 2’s perspective**, assuming Player 1 is rational and will also decide rationally.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the game under contract (both signed)**

Payoff matrix for Player 2 (you):

| P2 \ P1 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | 10       | 31       |
| A1     | -9       | 4        |

Can we find a dominant strategy for Player 2?

- If P1 plays A0 → P2 prefers A0 (10 > -9)
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 prefers A0 (31 > 4)

→ So **A0 is strictly dominant for P2** under contract.

Now for Player 1:

Payoffs (P1):

| P2 \ P1 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | 10       | -5       |
| A1     | 11       | 4        |

- If P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0 (10 > -5)
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 prefers A1 (4 > 11)? No — 11 > 4 → so P1 prefers A0 (11 > 4)

So:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0 (10 > -5)
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 prefers A0 (11 > 4)

→ So **A0 is strictly dominant for Player 1** under contract.

Therefore, **if both sign**, the rational outcome is:
- (A0, A0)
- Payoffs: P1: 10, P2: 10

Wait — but under contract, (A0,A0) gives (10,10), as computed.

Now compare this to the **base game** outcome.

---

### **Step 5: Compare signing vs not signing**

We now compare:
- If **both sign**, outcome is (A0, A0), payoff to P2: 10
- If **no contract**, what happens?

In base game:
- P2’s dominant strategy: A1
- P1’s dominant strategy: A0 (as we saw earlier)

So rational outcome: (A1, A0) → P2 gets 20

So in base game: P2 gets **20**

Under contract: P2 gets **10**

→ So **P2 gets less** under contract.

But wait — what if I **sign** the contract, but **Player 1 does not**?

Then the contract does **not activate**.

So the game returns to base.

So I can **only** get the contract benefits if **both** sign.

So there are two possible states:

1. **I sign**:
   - If P1 signs → contract active → outcome: (A0, A0) → P2 gets 10
   - If P1 doesn’t sign → contract inactive → base game → outcome: (A1, A0) → P2 gets 20

2. **I don’t sign**:
   - Contract inactive → base game → outcome: (A1, A0) → P2 gets 20

So **my expected payoff depends on P1’s decision**.

But **can I trust P1 to sign?**

Let’s analyze **P1’s incentives**.

Would P1 want to sign?

P1’s perspective:

- If **P1 signs**, and **I sign**, then:
  - P1 gets 10 (as in (A0,A0) under contract)
- If **P1 signs**, but **I don’t sign**, then contract inactive → base game → outcome (A1,A0) → P1 gets 0

- If **P1 doesn’t sign**, contract inactive → base game → outcome (A1,A0) → P1 gets 0

So:
- If P1 signs:
  - If I sign → P1 gets 10
  - If I don’t sign → P1 gets 0
- If P1 doesn’t sign → P1 gets 0

→ So P1 **would only sign if they believe I will sign**, otherwise they get 0 anyway.

So **only if I sign, does P1 benefit** by signing.

But P1 will only sign **if they expect me to sign**, and if they believe signing leads to better payoff.

But if P1 is rational and expects me to sign, then:
- Signing → gets 10 (if I sign)
- Not signing → gets 0

So **P1 prefers to sign** only if they believe I will sign.

But I need to ask: **Will I sign?**

If I sign, but P1 doesn’t, I get 20 (from base game)

But if I sign and P1 signs, I get only 10.

So if I sign, I get:
- 10 if P1 signs
- 20 if P1 doesn’t sign

But if I **don’t sign**, I get 20 regardless.

So **my payoff is 20 if I don’t sign**, or **up to 20 if I sign and P1 doesn’t**, or **10 if I sign and P1 does**.

So the **worst case** if I sign is 10, best is 20.

But if I don’t sign, I **guarantee 20**.

So unless I am confident that P1 will sign (and thus I get 10), I have **no incentive** to sign.

Moreover, P1 has no incentive to sign **unless they believe I will sign**.

But if P1 believes I will sign, then P1 gets 10 by signing, vs 0 by not signing → so P1 would sign.

But if **I** believe P1 will sign, then by signing, I get 10, but if I don’t sign, I get 20 → so I **won’t sign**.

Contradiction.

Let’s formalize:

Suppose I **believe P1 will sign**:
- Then if I sign → outcome (A0,A0) → I get 10
- If I don’t sign → contract inactive → (A1,A0) → I get 20
- So I prefer not to sign

But if I don’t sign, then P1 gets 0 if they sign (since I didn’t), so P1 won’t sign.

So P1 **has no incentive to sign unless I sign**, but I have no incentive to sign unless P1 signs.

→ This is a **coordination problem**.

But in this case, **both players want to avoid the contract**, because:
- If I sign, and P1 signs, I get 10 < 20
- If I sign and P1 doesn’t, I get 20
- If I don’t sign, I get 20 regardless

So **my payoff is at least 20** if I don’t sign, and potentially less than 20 if I sign.

So **signing is strictly dominated** for me.

Because:
- Not signing → guaranteed 20
- Signing → at best 20, at worst 10

→ So **signing can only hurt me, never help**

Therefore, **I should not sign**

---

### **Final Answer**

I should **not** sign the contract because:
- In the base game, I can guarantee 20 points by playing A1.
- Under the contract, if both sign, I get only 10.
- If I sign and P1 doesn’t, I get 20, same as base.
- But I have no incentive to risk a lower payoff (10) for no gain.

So the safest and best option is **not to sign**.

Player 2’s payoffs show that **A1 strictly dominates A0** for them:

- If you play A0 with probability \(q\), Player 2 gets  
  - from A0: \(10q + 2(1-q) = 2 + 8q\)  
  - from A1: \(20q + 4(1-q) = 4 + 16q\)  
  and \(4+16q > 2+8q\) for all \(q\). So Player 2 will choose **A1 with 100%**.

Given Player 2 plays A1, your payoffs are:
- If you play A0: 0
- If you play A1: 4

response:
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game and Payoffs

We are playing a simultaneous move game with two players. You are **Player 2**.

The payoff matrix (from Player 2’s perspective) is as follows:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | 10       | 2        |
| **A1**              | 20       | 4        |

Explanation:
- When both choose A0: You get 10.
- When you choose A1, opponent chooses A0: You get 20.
- When you choose A0, opponent chooses A1: You get 2.
- When both choose A1: You get 4.

So the payoffs for **you (Player 2)** are:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

---

### Step 2: Analyze Best Responses and Nash Equilibrium

We want to choose a strategy (a probability distribution over A0 and A1) that maximizes our expected payoff, assuming the other player is also rational and will play optimally.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that **Player 1** chooses A0.
- $ q $ = probability that **you (Player 2)** choose A0.

Then:
- Probability Player 1 chooses A1 = $ 1 - p $
- Probability you choose A1 = $ 1 - q $

Your expected payoff:
$$
E = q \cdot [p \cdot 10 + (1 - p) \cdot 2] + (1 - q) \cdot [p \cdot 20 + (1 - p) \cdot 4]
$$

Let’s simplify:

$$
E = q [10p + 2(1 - p)] + (1 - q)[20p + 4(1 - p)]
$$
$$
= q [10p + 2 - 2p] + (1 - q)[20p + 4 - 4p]
$$
$$
= q [8p + 2] + (1 - q)[16p + 4]
$$

Now expand:
$$
E = q(8p + 2) + (1 - q)(16p + 4)
= q(8p + 2) + 16p + 4 - q(16p + 4)
$$
$$
= q(8p + 2 - 16p - 4) + 16p + 4
= q(-8p - 2) + 16p + 4
$$

So:
$$
E = -8p q - 2q + 16p + 4
$$

We now analyze best responses.

---

### Step 3: Find Player 1’s Best Response

Player 1's payoffs (from their own perspective):

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | 10       | 0        |
| A1     | 6        | 4        |

So Player 1's payoff when choosing:
- A0: $ q \cdot 10 + (1 - q) \cdot 6 = 10q + 6 - 6q = 4q + 6 $
- A1: $ q \cdot 0 + (1 - q) \cdot 4 = 4(1 - q) = 4 - 4q $

Player 1 will prefer A0 if:
$$
4q + 6 > 4 - 4q
\Rightarrow 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q
\Rightarrow 8q > -2
\Rightarrow q > -0.25
$$

Which is always true since $ q \in [0,1] $. So **Player 1 always prefers A0 for any q?** Wait:

Wait! Let's double-check:

> If P1 chooses A0:
> - If P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 10
> - If P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 6

> If P1 chooses A1:
> - If P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 0
> - If P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 4

So P1’s expected payoff for A0: $ 10q + 6(1 - q) = 10q + 6 - 6q = 4q + 6 $

P1’s expected payoff for A1: $ 0 \cdot q + 4 \cdot (1 - q) = 4 - 4q $

Set equal:
$$
4q + 6 = 4 - 4q
\Rightarrow 8q = -2
\Rightarrow q = -0.25
$$

Again, since $ q \geq 0 $, for all $ q \in [0,1] $, $ 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q $, so **Player 1 always strictly prefers A0**, regardless of your strategy.

So, **Player 1 will always choose A0** in equilibrium.

Wait — is that right?

Let’s plug in q = 1 (you always choose A0):
- P1 A0: 10
- P1 A1: 6 → A0 better

q = 0 (you always choose A1):
- P1 A0: 6
- P1 A1: 4 → A0 better

q = 0.5:
- A0: 4*(0.5) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8
- A1: 4 - 4*(0.5) = 2 → A0 better

So yes: **Player 1’s best response to ANY strategy of Player 2 is to play A0 with probability 1.**

So Player 1 will choose A0 **with certainty**.

---

### Step 4: Given that Player 1 chooses A0 always, what is your best response?

Then your expected payoff:
- If you choose A0: you get 10
- If you choose A1: you get 20

So **20 > 10**, so you should choose A1 with probability 1.

But wait — what if Player 1 might deviate? But we just showed that **no matter what you do, Player 1 strictly prefers A0**, so they will always play A0.

So best response for you: always play A1.

Then:
- You get 20 points (since you choose A1, opponent chooses A0)
- Player 1 gets 0

So your optimal strategy is: **play A1 with probability 100%, A0 with 0%**.

---

### Step 5: The Contract – but it's rejected

There was a proposed contract:
- If you play A0, you get +11 points, split from other player
- If you play A1, nothing

But it was rejected by **Player 2** — i.e., you.

So **the contract is not active**, and **you are playing the original game only**.

So you do **not** get that bonus.

Therefore, decision is purely based on original payoffs.

---

### Step 6: Final Decision

Since Player 1 will always play A0 (best response), you should play A1 to get 20 > 10.

So your optimal strategy is:
- A0: 0%
- A1: 100%

This maximizes your expected payoff.

### ✅ Final Answer

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 12 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
To determine which contracts to approve, let's analyze the payoff matrix and the effect of each contract on our points received. 

### Original Payoff Matrix
The original payoffs without any contract are as follows:
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 10 points, Player 2 gets 10 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 20 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 6 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 4 points, Player 2 gets 4 points.

### Contract Analysis

#### Contract Proposed by Player 1
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, taken equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 points, distributed equally among the other player.

##### New Payoff with Player 1's Contract
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 15 points (10 + 5), Player 2 gets 15 points (10 + 5).
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets -2.5 points (0 + 5 - 7.5), Player 2 gets 17.5 points (20 - 2.5).
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3.5 points (6 - 2.5 + 0), Player 2 gets -0.5 points (2 + 2.5 - 5).
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 1.5 points (4 - 2.5), Player 2 gets 1.5 points (4 - 2.5).

#### Contract Proposed by Player 2
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 12 points, taken equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

##### New Payoff with Player 2's Contract
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 22 points (10 + 12), Player 2 gets 22 points (10 + 12).
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets -6 points (0 + 12 - 18), Player 2 gets 8 points (20 - 12).
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets -2 points (6 - 12), Player 2 gets 14 points (2 + 12).
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 4 points (4 + 0), Player 2 gets 4 points (4 + 0).

### Approval Decision
To decide which contract to approve:
- **Player 1's Contract**: This contract makes it unattractive for both players to choose A1 because of the penalty, thus encouraging mutual cooperation towards A0. This results in balanced payoffs, avoiding extreme losses.
- **Player 2's Contract**: This contract highly rewards choosing A0, but significantly penalizes the opposing player if they don't match A0. The high variability in payoffs and potential for negative points makes it risky if the choices are not aligned.

Since Player 1's contract creates a more stable and mutually beneficial scenario, it is more advantageous.

response:
To determine whether to approve the proposed contracts, we need to analyze how they impact our total points in the game. We'll start by looking at the payoffs and see how each contract modifies them. We'll then compare the outcomes to identify which one maximizes our points. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Payoff Matrix Without Contracts:
| You \ Other | A0         | A1         |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**      | (10, 10)   | (0, 20)    |
| **A1**      | (6, 2)     | (4, 4)     |

#### Contract Analysis:

**Contract proposed by Player 1:**
- If a player chooses A0:
  - They receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.
  - Therefore, if you choose A0 and the other chooses A0, you get 15 points and the other player gets 5 points.
  - If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1, you get 5 points and the other player gets 15 points.
  
- If a player chooses A1:
  - They pay an additional payment of 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.
  - Therefore, if you choose A1 and the other chooses A0, you get 1 point and the other player gets 7 points.
  - If you choose A1 and the other chooses A1, you get -1 point and the other player gets 9 points.

The updated payoff matrix with Player 1's contract:
| You \ Other | A0           | A1           |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**      | (15, 5)      | (5, 15)      |
| **A1**      | (1, 7)       | (-1, 9)      |

**Contract proposed by Player 2:**
- No additional payments are introduced, so the payoffs remain the same.

The payoff matrix with Player 2's contract:
| You \ Other | A0         | A1         |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**      | (10, 10)   | (0, 20)    |
| **A1**      | (6, 2)     | (4, 4)     |

### Comparison and Analysis:
To maximize our total points, we want to prioritize higher payoffs for ourselves. Looking at the two contracts:

1. **Player 1's Contract**:
    - When both choose A0: You get 15 points.
    - When you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 5 points.
    - When you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 1 point.
    - When both choose A1: You get -1 point.

2. **Player 2's Contract**:
    - When both choose A0: You get 10 points.
    - When you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 0 points.
    - When you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 6 points.
    - When both choose A1: You get 4 points.

With Player 1's contract, the best-case scenario gives you a higher payoff of 15 points using A0, and the worst-case scenario gives you lower payoff of -1 point using A1. In the absence of cooperation (if both act selfishly or randomly), the payoff can swing drastically.

With Player 2's contract, the payoffs are more stable and predictable:
- The best possible payoff is 10 points using A0.
- The worst case is 0 points using A0.

Considering stability, predictability, and having a more consistent strategy, Player 2's contract appears more favorable. Also, Player 2's contract avoids the risk of negative points that could result from Player 1's contract.

Therefore, I will choose to approve Player 2's contract and disapprove Player 1's contract.

response:
To tackle this problem, we need to analyze the payoff structure of the game and assess how the proposed contracts will affect our expected utility in terms of points. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Basic Payoff Matrix:**
   First, we review how many points each player receives based on their choices.
   - If both choose A0: (10, 10)
   - If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: (0, 20)
   - If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: (6, 2)
   - If both choose A1: (4, 4)

2. **Assess Each Contract Proposal:**

   #### Contract 1 (Proposed by Player 1):
   - If a player chooses A0, they get an additional payment of 5 points drawn equally from the other player.
     - P1 chooses A0: +5 points from P2.
     - P2 chooses A0: +5 points from P1.
   
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 points distributed equally among the other players.
     - P1 chooses A1: -5 points to P2.
     - P2 chooses A1: -5 points to P1.

   #### Contract 2 (Proposed by Player 2):
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 5 points drawn equally from the other player.
     - P1 chooses A0: +5 points from P2.
     - P2 chooses A0: +5 points from P1.

   - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments in either direction.
     - This doesn't affect payoffs for action A1.

3. **Calculate Modified Payoffs with Each Contract:**

   #### With Contract 1:
   - If both choose A0: (10+5, 10-5) -> (15, 5)
   - If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: (0+5, 20-5) -> (5, 15)
   - If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: (6-5, 2+5) -> (1, 7)
   - If both choose A1: (4-5, 4-5) -> (-1, -1)
   
   #### With Contract 2:
   - If both choose A0: (10+5, 10-5) -> (15, 5)
   - If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: (0+5, 20) -> (5, 20)
   - If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: (6, 2+5) -> (6, 7)
   - If both choose A1: (4, 4) -> (4, 4)

4. **Determine Approval Based on Expected Outcomes:**
   - **Contract 1**: The additional penalty for choosing A1 makes this option very unattractive due to its negative payoff when both choose A1, and it also significantly benefits the other player more in certain situations.
   - **Contract 2**: This contract incentivizes A0 for both players, maximizing points without imposing a harsh penalty on A1, which remains a viable option.

### Final Decision:
Given that Contract 2 offers a more favorable balance of payoffs while not creating an excessive penalty for A1, it is in our best interest to approve Contract 2 and disapprove Contract 1.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}
```

This ensures we choose the contract that better aligns with our objective to maximize our points in the game.

response:
Let's analyze each proposed contract and see whether they are beneficial or detrimental to our goal of maximizing our points.

### Basic Game Analysis:
First, let's examine the payoffs without any contracts:

- Both choose A0: 10 points for each player
- I choose A1, they choose A0: 20 points for me, 0 points for the other player
- I choose A0, they choose A1: 2 points for me, 6 points for the other player
- Both choose A1: 4 points for each player

As Player 2, my goal is to maximize my expected points.

### Contract Proposed by Player 1:
- A0: Receive an additional 5 points, drawn equally from the other player. This means if I choose A0, I get 5 points from the other player.
    - If both choose A0: 
      - I get 10 + 5 = 15 points.
      - The other player gets 10 - 5 = 5 points.
    - If I choose A1 and they choose A0:
      - I get 20 points.
      - The other player gets 0 points.
    - If I choose A0 and they choose A1:
      - I get 2 + 5 = 7 points.
      - The other player gets 6 - 5 = 1 point.
    - If both choose A1:
      - I get 4 - 5 = -1 points.
      - The other player gets 4 - 5 = -1 points.

Thus, the payoffs become:
- Both choose A0: (15, 5)
- I choose A1, they choose A0: (20, 0)
- I choose A0, they choose A1: (7, 1)
- Both choose A1: (-1, -1)

### Contract Proposed by Player 2 (Me):
- A0: Receive an additional 5 points, drawn equally from the other player. This means if I choose A0, I get 5 points from the other player.
- A1: No additional payments.

    - If both choose A0: 
      - I get 10 + 5 = 15 points.
      - The other player gets 10 - 5 = 5 points.
    - If I choose A1 and they choose A0:
      - I get 20 points.
      - The other player gets 0 points.
    - If I choose A0 and they choose A1:
      - I get 2 + 5 = 7 points.
      - The other player gets 6 - 5 = 1 point.
    - If both choose A1:
      - I get 4 points.
      - The other player gets 4 points.

Thus, the payoffs become:
- Both choose A0: (15, 5)
- I choose A1, they choose A0: (20, 0)
- I choose A0, they choose A1: (7, 1)
- Both choose A1: (4, 4)

### Decision
Comparing the final payoffs, both contracts offer the same enhanced reward for (A0, A0) and (A0, A1) cases due to the +5 points for A0. However, the first contract offers significant penalties for A1 choices, including negative points in the case of (A1, A1), which is detrimental.

Being Player 2, I should choose the contract that provides me the most points without the risk of negative points. Therefore, I should approve my own proposed contract and not approve the one proposed by Player 1.

Let's break down the decision-making process step by step to figure out which contracts should be approved in order to maximize your total points.

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix
The original game’s payoffs can be summarized as follows:

|              | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 10, 10       | 0, 20        |
| **Player 1: A1** | 6, 2         | 4, 4         |

### Step 2: Impact of Contract Proposed by Player 1
#### Contract Details:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Effectively, this means:
- Player choosing A0 gains an extra 5 points.
- Player choosing A1 loses an extra 5 points.

The new modified payoffs with this contract would be:

|              | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 15, 5        | 5, 15        |
| **Player 1: A1** | 1, 7         | -1, 9        |

### Step 3: Impact of Contract Proposed by Player 2
#### Contract Details:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payment in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Effectively, this means:
- Player choosing A0 has no change.
- Player choosing A1 loses an extra 10 points.

The new modified payoffs with this contract would be:

|              | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1:A0** | 10, 10        | 0, 20        |
| **Player 1: A1** | -4, 6        | -6, -6       |

### Step 4: Analysis and Decision Making
#### Evaluating the Contracts

**Contract Proposed by Player 1:**
- This contract incentivizes both players to choose A0 because the payoff for choosing A0 is significantly improved due to the added 5 points.
- Choosing A1 becomes less attractive because now it costs an extra 5 points.
- Expected dominant strategies would be both players choosing A0, yielding payoffs of 15 points for both players.

**Contract Proposed by Player 2:**
- This contract strongly disincentivizes choosing A1 due to the highly punitive nature (losing 10 points).
- Expected dominant strategies would likely be both players choosing A0 as well.
- Expected payoffs if both choose A0 remain 10 points for both players.

### Step 5: Approvals
- **Player 1’s Contract**: This contract results in Player 1 possibly earning the highest payoff (15 points) if both choose A0.
- **Player 2’s Contract**: This contract keeps the status quo for A0 (10 points each), but harshly penalizes A1, making it less attractive.

Therefore, based on maximizing Player 1's points, we should approve Contract 1.

### Final JSON Object

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": false
}
```

This JSON object reflects the approval of Contract 1, as deemed optimal for maximizing Player 1's (your) total points.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

To analyze this decision-making game and determine which contracts to approve, let’s break down each contract into its components and evaluate how they impact your total expected points.

### Basic Payoff Structure
Here is the payoff matrix without any contracts, where you are Player 1 (P1) and the other player is Player 2 (P2):

| P1 \ P2 | A0        | A1        |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| A0      | (10, 10)  | (0, 20)   |
| A1      | (6, 2)    | (4, 4)    |

### Contract Analysis
#### Contract proposed by Player 1 (C1)
- If A0: +5 points, taken from the other player (net change: +5, other player: -5)
- If A1: -5 points, given to the other player (net change: -5, other player: +5)

**Revised Payoff Matrix for C1:**

| P1 \ P2 | A0            | A1                |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| A0      | (15, 5)       | (5, 15)           |
| A1      | (1, 7)        | (-1, 9)           |

#### Contract proposed by Player 2 (C2)
- If A0: +5 points, taken from the other player (net change: +5, other player: -5)
- If A1: No additional payments

**Revised Payoff Matrix for C2:**

| P1 \ P2 | A0            | A1        |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| A0      | (15, 5)       | (5, 15)   |
| A1      | (6, 2)        | (4, 4)    |

### Evaluating the Impact on Your Expected Payoff

Let's reason through each contract:

1. **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
   - **A0/A0 choice:** P1 gets 15 points, P2 gets 5 points
   - **A0/A1 choice:** P1 gets 5 points, P2 gets 15 points
   - **A1/A0 choice:** P1 gets 1 point, P2 gets 7 points
   - **A1/A1 choice:** P1 gets -1 points, P2 gets 9 points
   
   Choosing A1 itself sees a penalty because it causes net losses from the extra payments. Hence, you are heavily incentivized to choose A0 for the highest assured gain of 15 points.

2. **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
   - **A0/A0 choice:** P1 gets 15 points, P2 gets 5 points
   - **A0/A1 choice:** P1 gets 5 points, P2 gets 15 points
   - **A1/A0 choice:** P1 gets 6 points, P2 gets 2 points
   - **A1/A1 choice:** P1 gets 4 points, P2 gets 4 points

   Here, the additional payments only apply if A0 is chosen, incentivizing both players towards A0. However, A1 doesn't cause a detriment to P1 as severe as in C1 since there is no payment imposition on A1.

### Decision-Making
Considering both contracts:
- **Contract C1 severely penalizes A1, potentially leading to more predictable but risk-averse behavior by both players aiming at A0.**
- **Contract C2 encourages A0 but leaves A1 as an open strategic move without negative payments.**

From a perspective of maintaining the flexibility and maximizing chances, **Contract C2** supports a broader, less risky strategy.

### Final Approval JSON:

```json
{
    "C1": false,
    "C2": true
}
```

Hence, you would approve C2 but not C1 based on the described decision-making game.

response:
To determine which contracts you should approve as Player 1, we need to analyze the effect these contracts will have on the payoffs you receive, as well as their strategic implications. Let's break down each part:

### Basic Payoffs (Without Contracts)
#### Scenarios:
1. **Both choose A0**:
    - Payoff: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
2. **You choose A0, other chooses A1**:
    - Payoff: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
3. **You choose A1, other chooses A0**:
    - Payoff: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
4. **Both choose A1**:
    - Payoff: Both get 4 points.

### Expected Utility with Contracts
We'll need to adjust these payoffs based on the contracts:

#### **Contract proposed by Player 1 (C1)**:
- **If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.**
  - This means if you choose A0, you get 5 additional points, and the other player loses 5 points.
  - Conversely, if the other player chooses A0, they get 5 additional points, and you lose 5 points.
  
- **If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.**
  - This means if you choose A1, you lose 5 additional points, and the other player gains 5 points.
  - Conversely, if the other player chooses A1, they lose 5 additional points, and you gain 5 points.

#### **Contract proposed by Player 2 (C2)**:
- **If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.**
  - No changes to the base payoffs.
  
- **If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.**
  - This means if you choose A1, you lose 5 additional points, and the other player gains 5 points.
  - Conversely, if the other player chooses A1, they lose 5 additional points, and you gain 5 points.

### Analysis of Payoffs with Contracts:
1. **Contract C1**:
    - **Both choose A0**:
        - Your payoff: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
        - Other's payoff: \(10 - 5 = 5\)
    - **You choose A0, other chooses A1**:
        - Your payoff: \(0 + 5 = 5\)
        - Other's payoff: \(20 - 5 = 15\)
    - **You choose A1, other chooses A0**:
        - Your payoff: \(6 - 5 = 1\)
        - Other's payoff: \(2 + 5 = 7\)
    - **Both choose A1**:
        - Your payoff: \(4 - 5 = -1\)
        - Other's payoff: \(4 - 5 = -1\)

2. **Contract C2**:
    - **Both choose A0**:
        - Your payoff: \(10\)
        - Other's payoff: \(10\)
    - **You choose A0, other chooses A1**:
        - Your payoff: \(0\)
        - Other's payoff: \(20 - 5 = 15\)
    - **You choose A1, other chooses A0**:
        - Your payoff: \(6 - 5 = 1\)
        - Other's payoff: \(2 + 5 = 7\)
    - **Both choose A1**:
        - Your payoff: \(4 - 5 = -1\)
        - Other's payoff: \(4 - 5 = -1\)

### Approval Decision

#### Contract C1
- **For Player 1**: 
  - Pays substantially better if both choose A0 (+15 vs. +10).
  - Less penalizing when Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, (better payoff when you're at a disadvantage).
  - Heavily penalizes you when you choose A1 regardless of Player 2. 

#### Contract C2
- **For Player 1**:
  - No additional benefits for choosing A0.
  - Penalization of the other player when they choose A1 is beneficial (+5).
  - Personal penalty for choosing A1 regardless of the other player's choice, similar to C1 but less impactful due to the symmetric rule.

**Overall**: Contract **C1** is more favorable to you as it incentivizes mutual cooperation on A0 significantly more, guaranteeing you higher points in the common optimal case. It differentially impacts actions aimed at disincentivizing mutual A1 choices and values A0 more significantly.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

### Understanding the Game Setup
In the given game, each player has two actions (A0 and A1) to choose from, and the payoff matrix is as follows:
- If both choose A0: 10 points each.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 20 points, other gets 0 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 2 points, other gets 6 points.
- If both choose A1: 4 points each.

### Payoff Matrix Without Contract
The payoffs are:
- (A0, A0) -> (10, 10)
- (A1, A0) -> (20, 0)
- (A0, A1) -> (2, 6)
- (A1, A1) -> (4, 4)

### Analyzing the Contract
The proposed contract stipulates:
- If a player chooses A0, they get an additional 5 points (drawn from the other player).
- No additional payment for choosing A1.

This modifies the payoff matrix to:
- If both choose A0: (15, 5) each, net change is 0.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 20, other gets -5.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 7, other gets 1.
- If both choose A1: No change, 4 each.

### Payoff Matrix With Contract
The modified payoffs become:
- (A0, A0) -> (15, 15)
- (A1, A0) -> (20, -5)
- (A0, A1) -> (7, 1)
- (A1, A1) -> (4, 4)

### Strategic Considerations
With the contract:
- (A0, A0) becomes more attractive (15 > 10).
- (A1, A0) becomes less attractive because it penalizes the other player even more (-5).
- (A0, A1) gives a slight gain (7 > 2) but a significant decrease for the other player (1 vs 6).
- (A1, A1) remains the same.

### Decision to Sign the Contract
Signing the contract generally incentivizes cooperation (A0, A0) because it becomes the highest mutual payoff, reinforcing both players to aim for this outcome. Signing ensures that moves towards exploitation (A1, A0 or A0, A1) are less attractive due to their disparity. 

To maximize total points generally and ensure higher cooperative outcome:
- Signing the contract aligns both players' incentives towards mutual best outcome.

response:
To determine whether or not to sign the contract, we need to break down the potential outcomes and compare the payoffs with and without the contract.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Original Payoff Matrix (Without Contract):
1. **If both choose A0:**
   - Payoff: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.

2. **If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:**
   - Payoff: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.

3. **If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:**
   - Payoff: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.

4. **If both choose A1:**
   - Payoff: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.

#### New Payoff Matrix (With Contract):
   Here, we need to account for the additional payment of 5 points for A0, which is deducted from the other player.
   
1. **If both choose A0:**
   - You get: \(10 + 5 - 5 = 10\) points (Same as original).
   - Other player gets: \(10 + 5 - 5 = 10\) points (Same as original).

2. **If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:**
   - You get: \(0 + 5 - 0 = 5\) points.
   - Other player gets: \(20 - 5 = 15\) points.

3. **If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:**
   - You get: \(6 - 5 = 1\) point.
   - Other player gets: \(2 + 5 = 7\) points.

4. **If both choose A1:**
   - You get: 4 points (Same as original).
   - Other player gets: 4 points (Same as original).

#### Comparing Outcomes:
- **Without Contract:**
  1. Both A0: You: 10, Other: 10.
  2. You: A0, Other: A1 -> You: 0, Other: 20.
  3. You: A1, Other: A0 -> You: 6, Other: 2.
  4. Both A1: You: 4, Other: 4.

- **With Contract:**
  1. Both A0: You: 10, Other: 10. (No change)
  2. You: A0, Other: A1 -> You: 5, Other: 15.
  3. You: A1, Other: A0 -> You: 1, Other: 7.
  4. Both A1: You: 4, Other: 4. (No change)

#### Analysis:
- The contract modifies the payoffs for three out of the four outcomes.
- If both players play rationally to maximize their personal payoffs:
  - The safest mutual maximization without the contract would typically result in opting for (A1, A1) presuming no coordination. However, if both can trust playing (A0, A0), they both get the maximum of 10 points each.
- With the contract:
  - A0 becomes slightly more tempting due to the 5-point addition.
  - The maximum losses and down-sides from choosing A1 seem to increase, modifying likely outcomes in scenarios where strategy may vary.

#### Contract Signing Decision:
- Signing the contract can actually benefit both parties by adding incentive to collaborate towards (A0, A0) in expectation.
- Might offer a balance that could be more stable.

Ultimately, the decision to sign or not is based on whether the slight alteration in incentive structures seems favorable. Given it nudges parties slightly to cooperative (10,10) using additional 5 point exchange:

response:
Let's analyze the given game and determine the optimal strategy for maximizing our total points. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Game Payoff Matrix:
Let's rewrite the payoff matrices for clarity:

Without considering the contract:
- If both choose A0: You (Player 2) get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
- If you choose A1, the other chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If you choose A0, the other chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
- If both choose A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.

Including the added contract payoff:
- If both choose A0: You get 10 + 5 = 15 points, the other player gets 10 - 5 = 5 points.
- If you choose A1, other chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 + 5 - 5 = 0 points.
- If you choose A0, the other chooses A1: You get 2 + 5 = 7 points, the other player gets 6 - 5 = 1 point.
- If both choose A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.

### Formulating the Strategic Decision
To maximize our expected points, we need to consider how the other player might act and choose a strategy that takes advantage of that behavior.

#### Evaluating Possible Strategies:
Player 1's goal is also to maximize their points. Let's analyze their options:
- If Player 1 chooses A0, they are getting 5 points if you mix strategies.
- If Player 1 chooses A1, they avoid losing points directly but gain fewer absolute points.

Considering your role as Player 2 and aiming to leverage the contract:
- If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A0, you get 15 points; if they choose A1, you get 7 points.
- If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0, you get 20 points; if they choose A1, you get 4 points.

From this reasoning, Player 1 might reasonably think you (Player 2) have a stronger incentive to prefer A1 because the potential payoff of 20 points could be more tempting.

Given this, if both players are perfectly rational, let's assume a mixed strategy equilibrium. You as Player 2 might use a mixed strategy that carefully weighs the expected values from each combination and balances the probability of reaping high rewards.

However, since we have additional guaranteed rewards for choosing A0 irrespective of Player 1's choice, consider how to weight these. It still might warrant favoring A0 more often to secure those added benefits.

### Applying a Practical Mix:
A rational approach might involve a mixed strategy leaning just slightly more toward A1 because of its potential high reward, tempered by the need to claim safe incremental points.

Let's choose the following probabilities:
- A0: 45% (to retain that increase consistently especially given the added contract)
- A1: 55% (to maintain the higher payoff opportunities)

### Conclusion

Here is our final probability distribution for the actions:

```json
{"A0": 45, "A1": 55}
```

response:
To maximize your points in this decision-making game, we need to carefully analyze the payoff structure including the additional contract in place. Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix
First, we analyze the basic game without the contract:

1. **If both choose A0**: 
   - Player 1: 10 points
   - Player 2: 10 points

2. **If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1**: 
   - Player 1: 0 points
   - Player 2: 20 points

3. **If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0**: 
   - Player 1: 6 points
   - Player 2: 2 points

4. **If both choose A1**: 
   - Player 1: 4 points
   - Player 2: 4 points

### Step 2: Considering the Contract
The contract adds an additional payoff condition:
- **Choosing A0**: Receive an additional 5 points from the other player.
- **Choosing A1**: No additional payments.

Let's revise the payoff matrix by incorporating the additional contract:

1. **If both choose A0**: 
   - Player 1: 10 + 5 = 15 points 
   - Player 2: 10 + 5 = 15 points

2. **If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1**: 
   - Player 1: 0 + 5 = 5 points
   - Player 2: 20 - 5 = 15 points

3. **If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0**: 
   - Player 1: 6 - 5 = 1 point
   - Player 2: 2 + 5 = 7 points

4. **If both choose A1**: 
   - Player 1: 4 points 
   - Player 2: 4 points

### Step 3: Expected Payoff Calculation
Now we need to determine the probabilities that maximize the expected payoff for Player 1. We denote Player 1's probability of choosing A0 as \( p \) and the probability of choosing A1 as \( 1 - p \). Similarly, denote Player 2's probability of choosing A0 as \( q \) and A1 as \( 1 - q \).

The expected payoff for Player 1 can be calculated as:

\[ 
E_1 = 15pq + 5p(1-q) + 1(1-p)q + 4(1-p)(1-q)
\]

Simplifying this:

\[ 
E_1 = 15pq + 5p - 5pq + q - pq - 4q - 4 + 4p + 4q - 4pq
\]
\[ 
E_1 = (15-5-1) pq + 5p + q - 4q + 4p - 4 + 4q - 4pq
\]
\[ 
E_1 = 9pq + 9p + q - q - 4
\]
\[ 
E_1 = 9pq + 9p - 4
\]

Maximizing this expected payoff:

### Step 4: Strategy Selection
To maximize the expected payoff \( E_1 \), Player 1 should increase the values of \( pq \). Assuming Player 2 is rational and aiming to maximize their own utility, they will consider similar calculations. We can assume Nash equilibrium, where both players randomize strategies.

Therefore, the optimum strategy considering mutual interest and based on symmetry could reasonably be:

### Final Answer
Both players may opt to choose A0 with a certain probability and A1 with another equal probability since both players stand to gain equally from mixed strategies. Thus, both can play mixed strategies:

```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

This provides an equilibrium where each player diversifies their approach, ensuring neither is too predictable and mutual benefits are optimized.

response:
To decide whether to approve or disapprove each contract, we need to analyze how each contract affects the payoff structure and whether it benefits us as Player 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Baseline Payoff Matrix:**
   Without any contracts:
   - If both choose A0: (10, 10)
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: (20, 0)
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: (2, 6)
   - If both choose A1: (4, 4)

2. **Understanding Proposed Contract by Player 1:**
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points drawn equally from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

   Updated Payoff Matrix:
   - If both choose A0: (10+10/2, 10+10/2) = (15, 15)
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: (20, 0-10/2) = (20, -5)
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: (2+10/2, 6-10/2) = (7, 1)
   - If both choose A1: (4, 4)

3. **Understanding Proposed Contract by Player 2 (You):**
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points drawn equally from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

   Updated Payoff Matrix:
   - If both choose A0: (10+5/2, 10+5/2) = (12.5, 12.5)
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: (20, 0-5/2) = (20, -2.5)
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: (2+5/2, 6-5/2) = (4.5, 3.5)
   - If both choose A1: (4, 4)

### Evaluation:
**For Contract Proposed by Player 1:**
- Benefit in mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) is increased (15, 15) which is better than the baseline.
- Penalty for choosing A1 when the other selects A0 is harsh (20, -5), which disincentives risky strategies.
- Encourages mutually beneficial A0 strategies, potentially deterring you from opting for A1. 

**For Contract Proposed by Player 2:**
- Benefit in mutual cooperation is moderated (12.5, 12.5).
- Penalty for A1 when the other opts A0 (-2.5) is less severe but still present.
- A balanced trade-off, likely keeping dominant strategies within close outcome ranges.

### Final Decision:
Since both contracts aim to move incentives towards cooperation with different degrees of penalty for betrayal, you as Player 2 have a comparison of degrees:

- Player 1's contract has stronger penalties for risky actions (A1 when other selects A0) and stronger incentives for mutual cooperation.
- Your proposed contract leaves some room for A1 strategy with lower penalties and moderate advantages for cooperation.

Given these observations and aiming towards maximizing your own points:
- Approve both contracts as each provides structures potentially better than no contract and ensures some cooperative potential.
  
Here is the final JSON object with your approvals:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

This setup appreciates fair play with mutual outcomes, and balances each player’s strategic dominance with due consideration to maximal collective benefit with room for individual maximization when the situation permits.

response:
1. **Compute the equilibrium payoffs under each contract (including transfers).**

**Base game (no contract):** Player 2 (me) has a strictly dominant action **A1**, so the Nash equilibrium is **(A1, A1)** giving me **4**.

---

### Contract C1 (A0 gets +10 paid by the other player)
Modify payoffs by adding:
- If I play **A0**: I receive +10 (other pays 10).
- If Player 1 plays **A0**: they receive +10 (I pay 10).

Resulting incentives:
- Player 1 gets a **dominant** incentive to play **A0** (it becomes best regardless of what I do).
- Given Player 1 plays **A0**, I am indifferent between **A0** and **A1** and get **10** either way.

So under C1, my equilibrium payoff is **10**.

---

### Contract C2 (A1 pays 5 to the other player)
Modify payoffs by adding:
- If I play **A1**: I pay 5 to Player 1.
- If Player 1 plays **A1**: they pay 5 to me.

Resulting incentives:
- Player 1 again has a **dominant** action **A0**.
- Given Player 1 plays **A0**, my best response is **A1** (I get **15** vs 10 with A0).

So under C2, the equilibrium is **(A0, A1)** and my payoff is **15**.

---

2. **Voting strategy**
I prefer **C2 (15)** over **C1 (10)**. Also, approving **C1** can only increase the chance C1 is selected (via ties), which lowers my expected payoff. Therefore I should **approve only C2**.

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contracts)**

We are Player 2 in a simultaneous-move game with Player 1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 (Player 1) | A1 (Player 1) |
|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**                        | You: 10, P1: 10 | You: 2, P1: 6 |
| **A1**                        | You: 20, P1: 0  | You: 4, P1: 4 |

So, as **Player 2**, your payoffs are:

- If you play A0:
  - vs A0: 10
  - vs A1: 2
- If you play A1:
  - vs A0: 20
  - vs A1: 4

---

### **Step 2: Analyze optimal strategies in the base game**

We want to see what a rational player would do in the base game, assuming both players are self-interested and trying to maximize their own points.

Let’s suppose Player 1 chooses A0 with probability *p*, A1 with (1–p).

Your expected payoff for choosing A0:
- E0 = 10*p + 2*(1–p) = 10p + 2 – 2p = 8p + 2

Your expected payoff for choosing A1:
- E1 = 20*p + 4*(1–p) = 20p + 4 – 4p = 16p + 4

You prefer A1 when:
- 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → 8p > -2 → always true (since p ≥ 0)

Wait: 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → 8p > -2 → true for all p ≥ 0.

But let's check for specific values:

- If p = 0 (Player 1 always plays A1):
  - E0 = 2, E1 = 4 → choose A1
- If p = 1 (Player 1 always plays A0):
  - E0 = 10, E1 = 20 → choose A1

So **A1 dominates A0** for you (Player 2) regardless of what Player 1 does.

You **always prefer A1**, no matter what Player 1 does.

Similarly, check for Player 1:

If you (P2) play A0 with probability q, A1 with (1–q)

Player 1's payoff:

- If P1 plays A0: 10*q + 0*(1–q) = 10q
- If P1 plays A1: 6*q + 4*(1–q) = 6q + 4 – 4q = 2q + 4

P1 prefers A0 when: 10q > 2q + 4 → 8q > 4 → q > 0.5

So Player 1:
- Plays A0 if q > 0.5
- Plays A1 if q < 0.5
- Indifferent at q = 0.5

Now, back to P2: we’ve established that **P2 always prefers A1**, no matter what P1 does.

So in any rational equilibrium, **P2 will play A1 with probability 1**.

Then, Player 1 faces: P2 plays A1 100% of the time.

So P1's best response:
- A0: gets 0
- A1: gets 4
→ So P1 will play A1

Thus, **(A1, A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium.

Result: both players get 4 points.

But wait — is there any incentive to deviate?

Suppose P2 thinks P1 may play A0 with some probability. But P2's best response is still A1 regardless.

So yes, P2 should play A1 for sure.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the contracts**

Two contracts are proposed. Both must be **approved** by **both players** to be in effect? No — the description says:

> "A contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So **Only contracts that receive at least one approval can be considered**, and **the one with the most approvals wins**, and if tied, it’s chosen uniformly at random.

Each player decides independently whether to **approve** a contract.

We are **Player 2**, and we are to decide whether to approve each contract.

We must **maximize our expected points**, assuming:
- The chosen contract is applied
- Players may change their probabilities based on the contract
- We want to pick contracts that **benefit us**, ideally ones that lead to higher payoff.

But note: **Contracts are only applied if both players approve them?** Not necessarily.

Actually, the description says:

> "a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process"

So **both players must approve** for a contract to be applied.

But wait — the contract is not applied unless approved by **all players**? The wording says “if the players agree”.

So likely, a contract is **implemented only if approved by both players**.

But the rule says:

> "The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

This means that **multiple contracts may be approved by players**, and the one with the **most approvals** wins — even if not everyone approves it.

But that implies that **only one contract is applied**, and it’s the one with the most approvals.

But for a contract to be implemented, **should it be approved by all players?** Not necessarily.

The phrase “if the players agree” is ambiguous.

But the voting process says: “approval voting process” — likely meaning **each player votes to approve or disapprove each contract**.

Then, the contract with the **highest number of approvals** is chosen.

That means a contract **only needs to be approved by at least one** player to be eligible, and the most-approved one wins — **even if one player disapproves**, as long as it has more approvals.

But that seems odd. How can a contract that one player disapproves be implemented?

Let’s look at the rule:

> "A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play."

> "The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So: **Each player independently approves or disapproves each contract**.

Then, after voting, the contract(s) with the **maximum number of approvals** are considered, and one is chosen uniformly at random.

So if C1 has 2 approvals (both approve), C2 has 1 approval (only P1 approves), then C1 wins.

But if C1 has 1 approval (only P2), C2 has 1 approval (only P1), then both have max (1), and one is chosen at random.

So a contract **can be implemented even if one player disapproves**, so long as it gets the most approvals.

Thus, **we should approve contracts that are beneficial for us**, even if the other player disapproves — but we should not approve ones that hurt us.

Our goal: **maximize our expected total points**, by choosing which contracts to approve.

Important: We do **not** control how the other player votes. We are only controlling our own approvals.

So we need to think about:
- What does each contract do?
- How will it affect the strategic game?
- What is our expected payoff in equilibrium **under each contract**, and in which contract is it highest?

But we can't observe the other player's vote — we only decide our own.

Our decision is: which contracts to approve, to **maximize our expected payoff**, knowing that:
- The winning contract is random among those with max approvals.
- We can only affect the approvals via our vote.

But the **outcome depends on the vector of votes**.

So we need to consider: **which contracts are most likely to lead to a higher payoff for us?**

But since we only control our approvals, and our goal is to **maximize our expected payoff**, we should approve contracts that:
1. Are **highly likely to be selected** (i.e., if we approve them, they get more approvals)
2. Yield **high expected payoff** for us when selected

But we can’t control the other player’s vote, so we must consider **what they might do**, but the problem doesn't say they are rational or self-interested — wait, actually, it says “you are playing a decision-making game with another player” and your goal is to maximize your points — it implies the other player has the same goal: maximize their own points.

So we assume both players are rational and self-interested.

Therefore, **Player 1 will approve only contracts that are beneficial for them**.

So our strategy must be: **approve contracts that are beneficial for us, and hope that Player 1 might also approve them, increasing the chance of our preferred contract winning**.

But let’s analyze contracts one by one.

---

### **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, **drawn equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 points, **distributed equally among the other players**.

So:
- If **you** (Player 2) choose A0 → you get +5, and Player 1 pays 5 to you (or you get 5 from P1).
- If **you** choose A1 → you pay 5 → lose 5, and that 5 goes to the other player (Player 1).

Similarly for Player 1:
- If P1 plays A0 → gets +5, you (P2) pay 5
- If P1 plays A1 → pays 5, you (P2) get 5

This is symmetric, but the **effect depends on who plays what**.

Let’s write the **total payoff** with this contract.

We need to compute total points for each combination, including the contract payments.

Let’s define the **total payoff** for each outcome under C1.

Assume the base payoffs are the original ones, and then add the contract payments.

But note: “drawn equally from the other players” — what does that mean?

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players"

→ So when a player plays A0, they get +5, and **the other player(s) pay them 5**.

> "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 points, distributed equally among the other players"

→ So when a player plays A1, they lose 5, and the other player(s) get 5.

Since there are only two players, “equally” means the entire 5 goes to the other player.

So:

- Whenever a player plays A0 → they gain 5, other player loses 5.
- Whenever a player plays A1 → they lose 5, other player gains 5.

So the contract **transfers 5 points from the player who chooses A1 to the player who chooses A0**, regardless of who is who.

But the **net transfer** depends on the actions.

Let’s tabulate the **contract adjustment**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|---------|---------|---------|
| A0 (P1) | P1 gains 5, P2 gains 5 → net 0 | P1 gains 5, P2 loses 5 → net transfer: P1 gains 10, P2 loses 10 |
| A1 (P1) | P1 loses 5, P2 gains 5 → net transfer: P1 loses 10, P2 gains 10 | P1 loses 5, P2 loses 5 → net transfer: both lose 5 |

Wait:

- When **P1 plays A0**, P1 gains 5 (from P2).
- When **P1 plays A1**, P1 loses 5 (to P2).
- When **P2 plays A0**, P2 gains 5 (from P1).
- When **P2 plays A1**, P2 loses 5 (to P1).

So total **contract effect** per cell:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | P1: +5, P2: +5 | P1: +5, P2: -5 |
| A1     | P1: -5, P2: +5 | P1: -5, P2: -5 |

Now add to original payoffs.

Recall base game:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | (10, 10) | (2, 6) |
| A1     | (20, 0) | (4, 4) |

Now with C1 contract adjustments:

**Cell (A0, A0)**: (10+5, 10+5) = (15, 15)

**Cell (A0, A1)**: (2+5, 6-5) = (7, 1)

**Cell (A1, A0)**: (20-5, 0+5) = (15, 5)

**Cell (A1, A1)**: (4-5, 4-5) = (-1, -1)

So now, the full payoff table under C1:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | (15, 15) | (7, 1) |
| A1     | (15, 5)  | (-1, -1) |

Now let’s analyze this game from **our perspective (Player 2)**.

We want to find the Nash equilibrium, or at least predict the outcome, assuming both are rational.

Let’s see:

**Player 2’s payoffs:**
- A0: 15 vs A0, 5 vs A1 → 15 vs 5 → prefer A0
- A1: 1 vs A0, -1 vs A1 → 1 vs -1 → prefer A1

Wait, **needs more careful analysis**.

Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 15 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → prefer A0

So regardless of P1’s choice, **P2 prefers A0**!

So A0 dominates A1 for Player 2.

Thus, **P2 will play A0 with probability 1**, if this contract is in effect.

Now for Player 1:

P1’s payoffs:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 5 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → prefer A0

So regardless of P2’s choice, **P1 prefers A0**!

So **P1 will play A0 with probability 1**.

Thus, equilibrium: both play A0.

Payoff: **(15, 15)**

So under C1, **we (P2) get 15 points**.

This is **much better** than base game (which was 4).

Now, what about the other player?

Player 1 also gets 15 — better than their base of 4.

So Player 1 **will also want to approve C1**, because it gives them 15 instead of 4.

So **both players prefer C1**.

So if we approve C1, and Player 1 also approves it, then C1 has 2 approvals → it wins (since C2 has only 1 possible approval at most).

Even if Player 1 disapproves, C1 has 1 approval (ours) → same as C2 if Player 1 approves C2.

But let’s check C2 first.

---

### **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2 (itself)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

→ So **no contract payments at all**.

This contract **does nothing** — it’s equivalent to **no contract**.

So **the game remains unchanged**.

Then, as before, equilibrium is (A1, A1), payoff: (4, 4)

So we get 4 points.

Now, will Player 1 approve C2?

C2 does nothing. It’s neutral. So if Player 1 gets 4 either way, and C2 does nothing, then **Player 1 is indifferent**.

But in approval voting, **do players approve indifferent contracts?**

The problem says “agree to it via an approval voting process”, and since it has no effect, **they might approve it anyway**, but unless it benefits them, they have no motive.

But since it does nothing, and they're rational, they might **not approve it**, because approving it doesn’t help them, and they could use their vote to help a beneficial contract.

But that assumes they know the future.

Since we don't know, **conservatively**, we assume that **Player 1 will only approve contracts that are beneficial to them**.

Since C2 has **no effect**, and doesn't hurt, but doesn't help, **they might approve it**.

But if they approve C2, and we approve C2, then C2 has 2 approvals.

C1 has at least 1 (ours) if we approve it.

But if **Player 1 approves C1**, which gives them 15 vs 4, they **must** approve it.

So Player 1 **will approve C1**.

Then, what about C2?

If Player 1 approves C1 and possibly C2 (but not required), but if they approve C2, then C2 gets 1 approval (P1), C1 gets 2 approvals (P1 and P2).

So C1 wins.

But if **Player 1 does not approve C2**, then C2 gets only 1 (p2) — but P1 disapproves.

Then C1 has 2 approvals (both approve), C2 has 1.

So C1 wins.

Thus, **C1 wins regardless of whether Player 1 approves C2**, as long as they approve C1 — which they will.

So **under the true rational behavior**:

- **Player 1 will approve C1** (it gives them 15 > 4)
- **Player 1 will not approve C2** (it does nothing; they lose no benefit but use a vote; better to approve C1)
- **We (Player 2) get 15 under C1**, which is better than 4 under C2 or base game.

So **C1 is better for us**.

Now, should we approve C1?

Yes — it leads to 15 points.

Should we approve C2?

C2 does nothing — we get 4 points if it’s selected.

But if we approve C2, and C1 gets 2 approvals (P1 and P2), then C1 wins — we get 15.

But if for some reason C1 doesn't get 2 approvals, then C2 could win.

But **Player 1 will approve C1**, since it benefits them.

So **if we approve C1**, C1 gets 2 approvals → wins → we get 15.

If we **don’t** approve C1, then C1 has only 1 approval (P1), C2 has 1 (ours) if we approve it.

Then both have 1 approval → one is chosen at random.

Then we have 50% chance of getting 15 (if C1 selected), 50% chance of getting 4 (if C2 selected).

Expected payoff: 0.5*15 + 0.5*4 = 7.5 + 2 = 9.5

But **if we approve C1**, then C1 wins for sure (since C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 at most), so we get **15**.

So **approving C1 gives us 15**, while not approving it gives us **only 9.5** on average (because if C1 is tied at 1, we get 15 only half the time).

Thus, **we should approve C1**.

Now, should we approve C2?

C2 does nothing — gives us 4 points if selected.

But if we approve C2, and C1 is also approved by P1 (which it is), then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 2 approvals (if we approve it and P1 approves it), so both have 2 approvals.

Then one is chosen at random — 50% chance of C1 (15 points), 50% chance of C2 (4 points).

Then expected payoff: 0.5 * 15 + 0.5 * 4 = 9.5

But if we **don’t approve C2**, then C2 has at most 1 (from P1), C1 has 2 (ours and P1) → C1 wins → we get 15.

So **approving C2 reduces our expected payoff from 15 to 9.5**, because it increases the chance of C2 being selected.

Thus, **we should NOT approve C2**.

Even if P1 approves C2, **we are worse off** by approving it, because it risks losing C1.

But if we don’t approve C2, C1 is certain to win (2 approvals), C2 has only 1 at most.

So **only way C2 wins is if we don’t approve it, and P1 doesn’t approve it** — but P1 will approve C1, and likely won’t approve C2 (since it doesn’t help).

But worst case: P1 approves C1 and C2, we approve C1 and not C2.

Then C1 has 2, C2 has 1 → C1 wins.

So **worst case, C1 wins**.

But if we approve C2, and P1 approves C2, then both have 2 approvals → random draw → 50% chance we get 4.

So **we are better off not approving C2**.

Therefore:

- Approve C1: gives 15 for sure
- Approve C2: risks reducing expected payoff to 9.5

So **we should approve only C1**.

---

### **Final Decision**

- C1 (Player 1’s contract): approve → gives us 15, and we know it will be applied unless we sabotage it, which we don’t want
- C2 (Player 2’s contract): do not approve → it does nothing, and only harms us by increasing risk of bad outcome

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let's carefully analyze the game both with and without the contract in place.

### Step 1: Understanding the payoff structure without the contract

Here are the payoffs for each scenario without the contract:

- Both choose A0:
  - Player 1: 10 points
  - Player 2: 10 points
- You choose A0, the other chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 0 points
  - Player 2: 20 points
- You choose A1, the other chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 6 points
  - Player 2: 2 points
- Both choose A1:
  - Player 1: 4 points
  - Player 2: 4 points

### Step 2: Understanding the impact of the contract

The contract modifies the payoffs as follows (consider the additional 5-point transfer):

- Both choose A0:
  - Player 1: 10 + 5 - 5 = 10 points
  - Player 2: 10 + 5 - 5 = 10 points (no net change)
- You choose A0, the other chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 0 + 5 - 5 = 0 points
  - Player 2: 20 - 5 + 5 = 20 points (no net change)
- You choose A1, the other chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 6 - 5 + 5 = 6 points
  - Player 2: 2 + 5 - 5 = 2 points (no net change)
- Both choose A1:
  - Player 1: 4 - 5 + 5 = 4 points
  - Player 2: 4 - 5 + 5 = 4 points (no net change)

### Step 3: Comparing the payoffs

From the above analysis, it becomes clear that the contract doesn't actually alter the total payoffs in any of the scenarios:
- Both A0: unchanged
- A0/A1 or A1/A0: unchanged
- Both A1: unchanged

### Step 4: Evaluation

Since the contract does not change the payoffs, signing it or not signing it will result in the same outcomes. Therefore, signing the contract doesn't negatively affect you, nor does it bring any additional benefit or risk.

Given that signing the contract has no downside (it doesn't negatively impact your payoffs) and assuming the goal is to reach cooperative behavior where agreements and trust can be beneficial in broader contexts or future interactions, it is reasonable to choose to sign it.

### Final Answer

Based on the analysis above, the JSON response should be:

```json
{
  "sign": true

response:
Step 1: Work out play under each contract (assuming both players best-respond after the contract is chosen).

**Baseline (no contract)**  
- For me (Player 2), **A1 strictly dominates A0** (20>10 if P1 plays A0; 4>2 if P1 plays A1).  
- So I play A1; then Player 1 best-responds with A1.  
- Outcome: (A1, A1) with my payoff **4**.

---

Step 2: Compute payoffs under each proposed contract and the resulting equilibrium.

### Contract C1 (A0: +5 from other; A1: pay 5 to other)
With 2 players, this is a ±5 transfer between players based on chosen action.

Resulting net payoffs (P1, P2):
- (A0,A0): (10, 10)
- (P2 A1, P1 A0): (10, 10)
- (P2 A0, P1 A1): (-4, 12)
- (A1,A1): (4, 4)

Best responses:
- Player 1: **A0 is dominant** (10 beats -4 when P2=A0; 10 beats 4 when P2=A1).
- Given P1=A0, I’m indifferent (10 either way).

So C1 yields me **10** (in equilibrium).

---

### Contract C2 (A0: 0; A1: pay 5 to other)
Net payoffs (P1, P2):
- (A0,A0): (10, 10)
- (P2 A1, P1 A0): (5, 15)
- (P2 A0, P1 A1): (1, 7)
- (A1,A1): (4, 4)

Best responses:
- Player 1: **A0 is dominant** (10 beats 1 when P2=A0; 5 beats 4 when P2=A1).
- Given P1=A0, my best response is **A1** (15 > 10).

So C2 yields me **15** (in equilibrium).

---

Step 3: Vote strategically given approval voting and random tie-break among top-approved contracts.

Preferences:
- Me (P2): **C2 (15) > C1 (10)**
- Player 1: **C1 (10) > C2 (5)**

Player 1 will (rationally) approve **C1 only** and reject C2, because approving C2 could allow C2 to beat C1 on approvals.

My best move is therefore to **approve only C2 and reject C1**, creating a 1–1 tie:
- Approvals: C1 = 1 (P1), C2 = 1 (me)  
- Winner chosen uniformly at random → my expected payoff = (10 + 15)/2 = **12.5**, which is better than guaranteeing C1 (10).

Final approvals:

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

response:
To maximize the total points received as Player 2, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and the effects of the proposed contracts.

**Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)
In the original game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy (A1), which leads to the Nash Equilibrium (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

**Contract C1 analysis:**
- (A0, A0): P1: 10 + 5 - 5 = 10, P2: 10 + 5 - 5 = 10. Result: (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): P1: 0 + 5 + 5 = 10, P2: 20 - 5 - 5 = 10. Result: (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): P1: 6 - 5 - 5 = -4, P2: 2 + 5 + 5 = 12. Result: (-4, 12)
- (A1, A1): P1: 4 - 5 + 5 = 4, P2: 4 - 5 + 5 = 4. Result: (4, 4)
Under C1, Player 1 has a dominant strategy to choose A0. If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 receives 10 points whether they choose A0 or A1. This is a significant improvement over the original 4 points.

**Contract C2 analysis:**
- (A0, A0): P1: 10 + 12 - 12 = 10, P2: 10 + 12 - 12 = 10. Result: (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): P1: 0 + 12 = 12, P2: 20 - 12 = 8. Result: (12, 8)
- (A1, A0): P1: 6 - 12 = -6, P2: 2 + 12 = 14. Result: (-6, 14)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4). Result: (4, 4)
Under C2, Player 1 has a dominant strategy to choose A0 (10 > -6 and 12 > 4). Player 2 also has a dominant strategy to choose A0 (10 > 8 and 14 > 4). This results in the equilibrium (A0, A0) with a payoff of 10 points for Player 2.

**Conclusion:**
Both contracts C1 and C2 incentivize cooperation (shifting the equilibrium toward a cooperative or higher-paying outcome for Player 2) and result in a payoff of 10 points for Player 2, compared to the 4 points in the base game. Therefore, approving both is optimal to ensure at least one contract is selected.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract or not, we need to analyze the impact of the contract on the payoffs for each choice combination. Here’s the breakdown step-by-step:

### Without Contract:
1. **Both choose A0:**
   - Player 1: 10 points
   - Player 2: 10 points

2. **Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:**
   - Player 1: 0 points
   - Player 2: 20 points

3. **Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:**
   - Player 1: 6 points
   - Player 2: 2 points

4. **Both choose A1:**
   - Player 1: 4 points
   - Player 2: 4 points

### With Contract:
1. **Both choose A0:**
   - Player 1: 10 + 5 (contract bonus) = 15 points
   - Player 2: 10 + 5 (contract bonus) = 15 points

2. **Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:**
   - Player 1: 0 + 5 (contract bonus) - 5 (pay to Player 2) = 0 points
   - Player 2: 20 - 5 (contract penalty) + 5 (receive from Player 1) = 20 points

3. **Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:**
   - Player 1: 6 - 5 (contract penalty) + 5 (receive from Player 2) = 6 points
   - Player 2: 2 + 5 (contract bonus) - 5 (pay to Player 1) = 2 points

4. **Both choose A1:**
   - Player 1: 4 - 5 (contract penalty) = -1 points
   - Player 2: 4 - 5 (contract penalty) = -1 points

### Analysis:
- With the contract:
  - Choosing A0 becomes more attractive because the rewards increase due to the contract bonus.
  - Choosing A1 becomes less attractive due to the contract penalty.

Therefore, the contract provides a significant incentive for both players to choose A0. This aligns both players' incentives more closely and could lead to a cooperative outcome where both players choose A0 and receive 15 points each. Signing the contract promotes cooperation and maximizes the payoff if both players act rationally.

### Conclusion:
By signing the contract, the dominant strategy shifts. Both players are more likely to choose A0, leading to a more desirable and higher payoff equilibrium for both players compared to the situation without the contract.

Thus, the most rational decision is to sign the contract.

response:
To assess whether to sign the contract, let's break down the game payoffs both with and without the contract, keeping in mind both the base payoffs and the added payments. The resulting payoffs will help inform the decision.

### Without the Contract Payoffs:

For Player 1 (P1):
1. P1 chooses A0, Other (P2) chooses A0: P1 gets 10, P2 gets 10.
2. P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 20.
3. P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0: P1 gets 6, P2 gets 2.
4. P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A1: P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4.

### With the Contract Payoffs:

If the contract is signed, the payments will adjust the payoffs:
- Choosing A0 gives an additional 5 points, deducted equally from the other player.
- Choosing A1 costs 5 points, distributed equally to the other player.

New payoffs including the contract adjustments would be:

1. P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A0:
   - P1 gets 10 + 5 = 15
   - P2 gets 10 + 5 = 15

2. P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1:
   - P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5
   - P2 gets 20 - 5 = 15

3. P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0:
   - P1 gets 6 - 5 = 1
   - P2 gets 2 + 5 = 7

4. P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A1:
   - P1 gets 4 - 5 = -1
   - P2 gets 4 - 5 = -1

### Analysis:

In scenarios involving the contract, choosing A0 consistently gives better results than choosing A1 for both players:
- A0-A0: 15 points for P1 and 15 points for P2.
- A0-A1: 5 points for P1 and 15 points for P2.
- A1-A0: 1 point for P1 and 7 points for P2.
- A1-A1: -1 point for both.

### Conclusion:

The contract incentivizes both players to choose A0 because both end up with positive and higher payoffs in all situations where they pick A0, and significantly lower (or negative) payoffs if they pick A1. Since signing the contract leads to a dominant strategy for both players to choose A0, which maximizes their points, it is beneficial to sign the contract.

Thus, our final decision would be:

```json
{"sign": true}
```

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the baseline game (no contract)

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

Analyzing best responses:
- **For me**: If other plays A0 → A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives 6. If other plays A1 → A0 gives 0 vs A1 gives 4.
- **For other**: If I play A0 → A0 gives them 10 vs A1 gives them 20. If I play A1 → A0 gives them 2 vs A1 gives them 4.

Player 2 has A1 as dominant strategy, so Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) giving me **4 points**.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1: +10 for playing A0)

Modified payoffs when accounting for the 10-point transfer:
- (A0, A0): I get 10 + 10 - 10 = **10**
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 10 = **10**
- (A1, A0): I get 6 - 10 = **-4**
- (A1, A1): I get **4**

My best response:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives -4 → **A0 better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives 4 → **A0 better**

**A0 is dominant for me under C1!** Similar analysis shows the other player also strongly prefers A0.

Expected equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get **10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2: +12 for playing A0)

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 10 + 12 - 12 = **10**
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 12 = **12**
- (A1, A0): I get 6 - 12 = **-6**
- (A1, A1): I get **4**

My best response:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives -6 → **A0 better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 12 vs A1 gives 4 → **A0 better**

**A0 is dominant for me under C2!** And also dominant for the other player.

Expected equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get **10 points**

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts:
- Lead to the same equilibrium outcome (A0, A0)
- Give me 10 points (vs 4 points without any contract)
- Are strictly better than no contract

Since both contracts benefit me equally and significantly improve my payoff, I should approve both to maximize the probability that at least one beneficial contract is implemented.

To maximize your points as Player 2, let's analyze the game and the proposed contracts step by step.

### 1. Game Analysis (No Contract)
The base payoffs (P1, P2) are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

For Player 2, A1 is a dominant strategy (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1 will choose A1 (4 > 0). The Nash Equilibrium without a contract is (A1, A1) with a payoff of **(4, 4)**.

### 2. Contract 1 (C1) Analysis
C1 adds a payment of +10 for choosing A0, taken from the other player.
- (A0, A0): P1: 10+10-10 = 10; P2: 10+10-10 = 10
- (A0, A1): P1: 0+10 = 10; P2: 20-10 = 10
- (A1, A0): P1: 6-10 = -4; P2: 2+10 = 12
- (A1, A1): P1: 4; P2: 4

In C1, A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1 (10 > -4 and 10 > 4). If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 is indifferent between A0 (10) and A1 (10). Regardless of Player 2's choice between A0 and A1, the payoff for Player 2 is **10**.

### 3. Contract 2 (C2) Analysis
C2 adds a payment of +12 for choosing A0, taken from the other player.
- (A0, A0): P1: 10+12-12 = 10; P2: 10+12-12 = 10
- (A0, A1): P1: 0+12 = 12; P2: 20-12 = 8
- (A1, A0): P1: 6-12 = -6; P2: 2+12 = 14
- (A1, A1): P1: 4; P2: 4

In C2, A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for both players. For Player 1: 10 > -6 and 12 > 4. For Player 2: 10 > 8 and 14 > 4. The unique Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0) with a payoff of **(10, 10)**.

### 4. Comparison and Decision
- Without a contract, you receive **4 points**.
- With C1, you receive **10 points** (assuming the equilibrium is reached).
- With C2, you receive **10 points** (assuming the equilibrium is reached).

Both contracts significantly improve your payoff compared to the base game. C2 makes A0 a strictly dominant strategy for both players, which typically results in a more stable outcome than the weak dominance in C1. However, in both cases, your expected payoff is 10. Approving both contracts maximizes the probability that one of them will be implemented, ensuring a higher payoff than if no contract were selected.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine whether or not you should sign the contract.

### Points Analysis Without Contract

First, let's re-evaluate the original payoffs without any contract:

1. Both choose A0:
   - Player 1: 10 points
   - Player 2: 10 points

2. You choose A0, the other player chooses A1:
   - Player 1: 0 points
   - Player 2: 20 points

3. You choose A1, the other player chooses A0:
   - Player 1: 6 points
   - Player 2: 2 points

4. Both choose A1:
   - Player 1: 4 points
   - Player 2: 4 points

### Points Analysis With Contract

Next, let's include the effect of the proposed contract. The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 5 points drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

Here's how the payoffs change with the contract:

1. Both choose A0:
   - Player 1: \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) points
   - Player 2: \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) points

2. You choose A0, the other player chooses A1:
   - Player 1: \( 0 + 5 = 5 \) points
   - Player 2: \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) points

3. You choose A1, the other player chooses A0:
   - Player 1: \( 6 - 5 = 1 \) points
   - Player 2: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) points

4. Both choose A1:
   - Player 1: 4 points
   - Player 2: 4 points

### Comparison of Strategies With and Without Contract

Let's compare the payoffs from the perspective of Player 1:

1. Without Contract:
   - Highest payoff when both players choose A0: 10 points.
  
2. With Contract:
   - Highest payoff when both players choose A0: 15 points.
   - Second highest payoff when Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: 5 points.
   - Third highest payoff when both choose A1: 4 points.
   - Lowest payoff when Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: 1 point.

From your perspective as Player 1, by signing the contract:
- The dominant strategy for both players becomes A0, as it maximizes the mutual benefit.
- Your best move is to choose A0 to achieve the highest payoff of 15 points against all other potential combinations.

Given that the contract aligns both players’ interests towards a mutually beneficial outcome, it is in your best interest to sign the contract.

### Conclusion

Given the above reasoning, here is the final decision in the required JSON format:

response:
To solve this problem, we need to maximize our total points in the game by choosing an optimal probability distribution over the actions A0 and A1. Let's break down the problem and see how we can derive our strategy given both the game's payoff table and the additional contract ruling.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding Payoffs Without Contract:**
   ```
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points.
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points.
   ```

2. **Contract Implication:**
   The contract adds an additional payment structure:
   
   ```
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an extra 5 points. Hence, the effective payoffs become:
       - You choose A0, other A0: 15 points (10 from game + 5 from contract).
       - You choose A0, other A1: 5 points (0 from game + 5 from contract).
   - If a player chooses A1, they lose 5 points. Hence, the effective payoffs become:
       - You choose A1, other A0: 1 point (6 from game - 5 from contract).
       - You choose A1, other A1: -1 point (4 from game - 5 from contract).
   ```

3. **Expected Payoff Calculation:**

   Let's define the probabilities for choosing A0 and A1 as \(p\) and \(1-p\), respectively. For the other player, we define the probabilities similarly as \(q\) for A0 and \(1-q\) for A1.

   The expected payoff for you can be calculated as:
   ```
   E = p*q * 15 (Both choose A0)
     + p*(1-q) * 5 (You choose A0, other chooses A1)
     + (1-p)*q * 1 (You choose A1, other chooses A0)
     + (1-p)*(1-q) * -1 (Both choose A1)
   ```

4. **Optimization Insight:**
   Clearly, the points are heavily skewed towards choosing A0 (dominant strategy):
   - \(15pq (A0, A0)\), \(5p(1-q) (A0, A1)\) have higher contributions compared to points from actions involving A1.
 
   From a game-theoretic perspective, if both players act rationally and consider maximizing their returns, choosing A0 overwhelmingly ensures higher points because both players benefit mutually from choosing A0 due to the contract terms.

5. **Final Strategy:**
   Given that choosing A0 is the best response considering both the payoff table and the contract, we should allocate all probability to choosing A0.

### Conclusion:

Therefore, our probability distribution should strongly bias towards always choosing A0:

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

This distribution ensures we maximize our expected points in the game given the payoff dynamics and the contract in place.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Original Game

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
- (P2: A0, P1: A0) → I get 10
- (P2: A0, P1: A1) → I get 2
- (P2: A1, P1: A0) → I get 20
- (P2: A1, P1: A1) → I get 4

Without any contract, A1 is my dominant strategy (20 > 10 if P1 plays A0; 4 > 2 if P1 plays A1). P1's best response to my A1 is also A1. 
**Expected outcome: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

With C1, the transfers work as follows:
- If I choose A0: I receive +5 from P1
- If I choose A1: I pay -5 to P1
- Same applies to P1's choices

Modified payoffs:
- (P2: A0, P1: A0) → 10 + 5 - 5 = **10**
- (P2: A0, P1: A1) → 2 + 5 + 5 = **12**
- (P2: A1, P1: A0) → 20 - 5 - 5 = **10**
- (P2: A1, P1: A1) → 4 - 5 + 5 = **4**

With C1, A0 becomes dominant for P1 (gets 10 vs -4 or 10 vs 4). Given P1 plays A0, I'm indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give 10).
**Expected outcome: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

With C2:
- If I choose A0: no payment
- If I choose A1: I pay -10 to P1

Modified payoffs:
- (P2: A0, P1: A0) → 10 + 0 = **10**
- (P2: A0, P1: A1) → 2 + 10 = **12**
- (P2: A1, P1: A0) → 20 - 10 = **10**
- (P2: A1, P1: A1) → 4 + 0 = **4**

This is identical to C1! A0 becomes dominant for P1.
**Expected outcome: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts transform the game from a prisoner's dilemma-like situation into one where cooperation (A0, A0) becomes the equilibrium. Both improve my expected payoff from 4 to 10 points.

Since both contracts give me the same superior outcome, I should approve both to maximize the chance that at least one is implemented.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the impacts of signing the contract on the payoffs for each player in each scenario.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Original Payoff Matrix:
1. Both choose A0 (P1: A0, P2: A0):
   - Player 1: 10 points
   - Player 2: 10 points

2. Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1 (P1: A0, P2: A1):
   - Player 1: 0 points
   - Player 2: 20 points

3. Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0 (P1: A1, P2: A0):
   - Player 1: 6 points
   - Player 2: 2 points

4. Both choose A1 (P1: A1, P2: A1):
   - Player 1: 4 points
   - Player 2: 4 points

#### Payoff Matrix with Contract:
The contract specifies:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.

With the contract:
1. Both choose A0 (P1: A0, P2: A0):
   - Player 1: 10 + 5 = 15 points
   - Player 2: 10 + 5 = 15 points

2. Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1 (P1: A0, P2: A1):
   - Player 1: 0 + 5 = 5 points
   - Player 2: 20 - 5 = 15 points

3. Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0 (P1: A1, P2: A0):
   - Player 1: 6 - 5 = 1 point
   - Player 2: 2 + 5 = 7 points

4. Both choose A1 (P1: A1, P2: A1):
   - Player 1: 4 - 5 = -1 point
   - Player 2: 4 - 5 = -1 point

### Decision Making:
- Without the contract, the players' incentives suggest a symmetric equilibrium with decent scores (e.g., both choosing A0 for 10 points each or both choosing A1 for 4 points each).
- With the contract, the penalties for choosing A1 become severe (negative points), shifting the incentive towards A0, which provides a higher and guaranteed positive payoff.

Given that the contract changes the incentives such that A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both, ensuring higher payoffs compared to the mixed strategies without the contract:

### Conclusion:
By analyzing the payoffs, it's clear that signing the contract provides a higher and more stable expected payoff for both players. Therefore, to maximize your total points, you should sign the contract.

### Final Answer:

  "sign": true

First incorporate the contract as a payoff adjustment.

- If **I choose A0**: I get **+5**, the other player gets **-5**.  
- If **I choose A1**: I get **-5**, the other player gets **+5**.  
- If **the other player chooses A0**: they get **+5**, so I get **-5**.  
- If **the other player chooses A1**: they pay **5** to me, so I get **+5**.

So my contract adjustment is:
- **+5** if I play A0, **-5** if I play A1
- plus **-5** if the other plays A0, **+5** if the other plays A1

Now compute my total payoff (base + contract):

1) Other A0, Me A0: base 10 + (+5) + (-5) = **10**  
2) Other A0, Me A1: base 20 + (-5) + (-5) = **10**  
3) Other A1, Me A0: base 2 + (+5) + (+5) = **12**  
4) Other A1, Me A1: base 4 + (-5) + (+5) = **4**

Best response:
- If other plays **A0**, I’m indifferent (10 vs 10).
- If other plays **A1**, I strictly prefer **A0** (12 vs 4).

So **A0 weakly dominates A1**, and the optimal strategy is to play **A0 with probability 1**.

To make a strategic decision in this game, we need to consider both the base payoffs and the modifications introduced by the contract. Let's break down the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Basic Payoffs:**
    - If both players choose A0: Player 1 gets 10 points, Player 2 gets 10 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 20 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 6 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
    - If both players choose A1: Player 1 gets 4 points, Player 2 gets 4 points.

2. **Understanding the Contract Effects:**
    - Choosing A0 results in an additional +5 points due to the contract.
    - Choosing A1 results in a -5 points penalty due to the contract.

3. **Modified Payoffs:**
    - If both players choose A0:
        - Player 1: 10 + 5 = 15 points
        - Player 2: 10 + 5 = 15 points
    - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
        - Player 1: 0 + 5 = 5 points
        - Player 2: 20 - 5 = 15 points
    - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
        - Player 1: 6 - 5 = 1 point
        - Player 2: 2 + 5 = 7 points
    - If both players choose A1:
        - Player 1: 4 - 5 = -1 point
        - Player 2: 4 - 5 = -1 point

4. **Expectation Calculation:**
    To calculate the expected payoff for choosing A0 or A1, we need to consider the probability of the other player's actions. Let's denote:
    - P(A0) as the probability that the other player chooses A0
    - P(A1) as the probability that the other player chooses A1
    Since P(A0) + P(A1) = 1, let's assume P(A0) = x and P(A1) = 1-x.

    **Expected Payoff for A0:**
    \[
    \text{Expected Payoff for A0} = 15 \cdot x + 5 \cdot (1-x) = 15x + 5 - 5x = 10x + 5
    \]

    **Expected Payoff for A1:**
    \[
    \text{Expected Payoff for A1} = 1 \cdot x + (-1) \cdot (1-x) = x - 1 + x = 2x - 1
    \]

5. **Equating Expected Payoffs:**
    To find the equilibrium point, we equate expected payoffs:
    \[
    10x + 5 = 2x - 1
    \]
    \[
    8x = -6
    \]
    \[
    x = -\frac{6}{8} = -\frac{3}{4}
    \]
    This value is outside the feasible range of probabilities (0 to 1), which indicates an error in analysis. Instead, we can look at critical value scenarios or mixed strategies other than pure ones (though in most practical cases this leads to considering extreme strategies).

### Optimal Strategy:
Given that mixed strategies led to infeasible values on the above setup, and considering practical decision-making and robustness to deviation:

Setting probabilities purely due to extreme observed payoffs:
- Choosing "A0" keeps resulting in higher net outcomes due to contract boost.
  
Best showing dominant indication comes from max A0:

Thus reasoning still set as to max result offsets:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
Looking at this decision-making game, I need to analyze each contract's impact and determine which ones benefit me.

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

Without any contract, let me find the Nash equilibrium:

For the other player:
- If I play A0: They get 10 from A0 vs 20 from A1 → prefer A1
- If I play A1: They get 2 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A1
- **A1 is dominant for the other player**

For me:
- If other plays A0: I get 10 from A0 vs 6 from A1 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 0 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A1

**Nash equilibrium without contracts: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With C1, each player choosing A0 receives 10 points from the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 10 + 10 - 10 = **10**
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 10 - 0 = **10**
- (A1, A0): I get 6 + 0 - 10 = **-4**
- (A1, A1): I get 4 + 0 = **4**

For me: A0 is now dominant (10 > -4 and 10 > 4)

For the other player (by symmetry in the contract):
- If I play A0: They get 10 from either action (indifferent)
- If I play A1: They get 12 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A0

**Nash equilibrium with C1: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

With C2, each player choosing A1 pays 5 points to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get **10**
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 5 = **5**
- (A1, A0): I get 6 - 5 = **1**
- (A1, A1): I get 4 - 5 + 5 = **4**

For me: A0 is dominant (10 > 1 and 5 > 4)

For the other player:
- If I play A0: They get 10 from A0 vs 15 from A1 → prefer A1

**Nash equilibrium with C2: (A0, A1) → I get 5 points**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **No contract**: 4 points
- **C1**: 10 points ✓ (best for me)
- **C2**: 5 points

## Step 5: Strategic voting analysis

The other player's payoffs are:
- **No contract**: 4 points
- **C1**: 10 points
- **C2**: 15 points (best for them)

Given that:
- I prefer: C1 > C2 > No contract
- They prefer: C2 > C1 > No contract

If I approve only C1 and they approve only C2:
- Both contracts get 1 vote each
- One is selected randomly (50/50)
- My expected payoff: 0.5(10) + 0.5(5) = 7.5 points

This is still better than no contract (4 points).

**My optimal strategy is to approve C1 only**, as it gives me the best outcome when it wins, and even in a tie scenario, it's beneficial.

response:
To decide on the optimal strategy, we need to evaluate the expected payoff for each combination of actions and probabilities. The twist involves considering the contract that provides an additional 5 points for choosing A0.

Here’s a breakdown of our payoffs with and without the contract:

### Payoff Breakdown Without Contract:
- **If both choose A0**: You get 10 points.
- **If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1**: You get 0 points.
- **If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0**: You get 6 points.
- **If both choose A1**: You get 4 points.

### Payoff Breakdown With Contract:
- **If both choose A0**: You get 15 points (your 10 + additional 5).
- **If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1**: You get 5 points (your 0 + additional 5).
- **If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0**: You get 1 point (your 6 - 5).
- **If both choose A1**: You get 4 points.

Let's denote:
- \( p \) as the probability you choose A0.
- \( 1 - p \) as the probability you choose A1.
- \( q \) as the probability the other player chooses A0.
- \( 1 - q \) as the probability the other player chooses A1.

#### Expected Payoffs Based on Probabilities:
1. **Choosing A0**:
   - If the other chooses A0: \(15q\)
   - If the other chooses A1: \(5(1 - q)\)

   Expected Payoff for A0:
   \[
   E(A0) = 15q + 5(1 - q) = 15q + 5 - 5q = 10q + 5
   \]

2. **Choosing A1**:
   - If the other chooses A0: \(1q\)
   - If the other chooses A1: \(4(1 - q)\)

   Expected Payoff for A1:
   \[
   E(A1) = 1q + 4(1 - q) = 1q + 4 - 4q = -3q + 4
   \]

#### Finding Optimal Probability, p:
We need to make a decision that maximizes our expected payoff. By setting the expected payoffs of A0 and A1 equal, we find the tipping point where our probability distribution should lie. 

\[
10q + 5 = -3q + 4
\]

Solving for \(q\):

\[
10q + 3q = 4 - 5
\]
\[
13q = -1
\]
\[
q = -\frac{1}{13}
\]

The traditional expectation approach for these mixed strategies normally requires \( q \in [0, 1] \), which isn’t solvable here directly — meaning we need another practical way: Either pure strategy or just direct pure allocation that maximizes this game step—plus psychological anticipate.

Given that choosing A0 directly simplifies assure beneficial overall more:

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

The base payoff matrix for me (Player 1):
- If other plays A0: I get 10 from A0, or 6 from A1 → A0 is better
- If other plays A1: I get 0 from A0, or 4 from A1 → A1 is better

For the other player (Player 2):
- If I play A0: They get 10 from A0, or 20 from A1 → A1 is better
- If I play A1: They get 2 from A0, or 4 from A1 → A1 is better

**A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.** Given this, I should play A1.

The Nash equilibrium without contract: **(A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- Playing A0: receive +12 points (paid by the other player)
- Playing A1: no change

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 12 - 12 = **10** points
- (A0, A1): 0 + 12 - 0 = **12** points  
- (A1, A0): 6 + 0 - 12 = **-6** points
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = **4** points

Now analyzing my best responses:
- If other plays A0: I get 10 from A0, or -6 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: I get 12 from A0, or 4 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy!**

For Player 2 (symmetric analysis):
- They also have A0 as a dominant strategy with the contract

The Nash equilibrium with contract: **(A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Decision

- Without contract: I get **4 points** (at equilibrium)
- With contract: I get **10 points** (at equilibrium)

The contract transforms the game so that both players are incentivized to cooperate (play A0), which benefits both of us. This is a significant improvement from 4 to 10 points.

**I should sign the contract.**

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to compare the outcomes with and without the contract.

**1. Analysis of the Original Game (No Contract):**
- **Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
  - (A0, A0): (10, 10)
  - (A0, A1): (0, 20)
  - (A1, A0): (6, 2)
  - (A1, A1): (4, 4)
- **Nash Equilibrium Analysis:**
  - **Player 2:** If P1 chooses A0, P2's best response is A1 (20 > 10). If P1 chooses A1, P2's best response is A1 (4 > 2). Thus, A1 is Player 2's dominant strategy.
  - **Player 1:** Knowing Player 2 will play A1, Player 1 chooses between A0 (0) and A1 (4). Player 1 will choose A1.
  - **Outcome:** The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in **4 points** for each player.

**2. Analysis of the Game with the Contract:**
- **Contract Rules:** Playing A0 gives a player +12 and takes 12 from the other player. Playing A1 involves no payments.
- **Payoff Adjustments:**
  - (A0, A0): P1: 10 + 12 - 12 = 10; P2: 10 + 12 - 12 = 10.
  - (A0, A1): P1: 0 + 12 - 0 = 12; P2: 20 + 0 - 12 = 8.
  - (A1, A0): P1: 6 + 0 - 12 = -6; P2: 2 + 12 - 0 = 14.
  - (A1, A1): P1: 4 + 0 - 0 = 4; P2: 4 + 0 - 0 = 4.
- **Nash Equilibrium Analysis:**
  - **Player 2:** If P1 chooses A0, P2's best response is A0 (10 > 8). If P1 chooses A1, P2's best response is A0 (14 > 4). Thus, A0 is Player 2's dominant strategy.
  - **Player 1:** If P2 chooses A0, P1's best response is A0 (10 > -6). If P2 chooses A1, P1's best response is A0 (12 > 4). Thus, A0 is Player 1's dominant strategy.
  - **Outcome:** The Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0), resulting in **10 points** for each player.

**3. Comparison:**
- Without the contract, you (Player 2) receive 4 points.
- With the contract, you (Player 2) receive 10 points.
- Since Player 1 also increases their payoff from 4 to 10 points, they are also likely to sign.
- Signing the contract specifically incentivizes choosing A0, transforming the game from a form of Prisoner's Dilemma/Asymmetric Trap into a mutually beneficial coordination where A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both.

**Conclusion:**
Signing the contract leads to a significantly higher individual and total payoff.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
Looking at this problem, I need to analyze each contract's impact on the game equilibrium and determine which ones maximize my expected payoff.

## Step 1: Analyze the Base Game

First, let me find the Nash equilibrium without any contracts:

**Base Game Payoff Matrix** (My payoff, Other's payoff):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Analyzing best responses:
- For me: If other plays A0 → I prefer A0 (10 > 6); If other plays A1 → I prefer A1 (4 > 0)
- For other: If I play A0 → Other prefers A1 (20 > 10); If I play A1 → Other prefers A1 (4 > 2)

**A1 is a dominant strategy for the other player**, so the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) giving me **4 points**.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With a 10-point payment for playing A0, the modified payoffs become:

**Modified Payoff Matrix with C1**:
- (A0, A0): (10+10-10, 10+10-10) = (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0+10-0, 20+0-10) = (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (6+0-10, 2+10-0) = (-4, 12)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy** (10 vs -4 if other plays A0; 10 vs 4 if other plays A1).

Given I play A0 with certainty, the other player is indifferent between A0 and A1 when I play A0. The Nash equilibrium gives me **10 points**.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

With a 5-point payment for playing A0:

**Modified Payoff Matrix with C2**:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (5, 15)
- (A1, A0): (1, 7)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**A0 is again my dominant strategy** (10 vs 1 if other plays A0; 5 vs 4 if other plays A1).

Given I play A0, the other player prefers A1 (15 > 10). The Nash equilibrium is (A0, A1) giving me **5 points**.

## Step 4: Strategic Voting Analysis

Now I need to think about approval voting strategically:
- C1 equilibrium: I get **10 points**, other gets **10 points**
- C2 equilibrium: I get **5 points**, other gets **15 points**
- Base game: I get **4 points**, other gets **4 points**

The other player prefers C2 (15 points) over C1 (10 points) over base game (4 points).

If I approve only C1 and the other player (rationally) approves only C2:
- Both contracts have 1 approval each
- Winner selected uniformly at random
- My expected payoff: 0.5(10) + 0.5(5) = **7.5 points**

If I approve both C1 and C2 while the other player approves only C2:
- C2 has 2 approvals, C1 has 1 approval
- C2 wins
- My payoff: **5 points**

Since 7.5 > 5, I should approve only C1 to force a tie in approvals, which is better for me than letting C2 win outright.

## Final Answer

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}
```

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game (no contract)

**Base payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)  
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Player 2's best responses:**
- If I play A0: They get 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0 → A1 is better
- If I play A1: They get 4 from A1 vs 2 from A0 → A1 is better

Player 2 will always play A1 (dominant strategy). Given this, I should play A1.
**Base game outcome: (4, 4)**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With +10 payment for choosing A0:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10) [I get +10-10, they get +10-10]
- (A0, A1): (10, 10) [I get 0+10, they get 20-10]
- (A1, A0): (-4, 12) [I get 6-10, they get 2+10]
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

A0 dominates for me (gives 10 vs -4 or 4). 
**C1 outcome: (10, 10)**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

With +5 payment for choosing A0:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (5, 15) [I get 0+5, they get 20-5]
- (A1, A0): (1, 7) [I get 6-5, they get 2+5]
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

A0 dominates for me. Player 2 prefers A1 when I play A0 (15 > 10).
**C2 outcome: (5, 15)**

## Step 4: Strategic voting analysis

My payoffs: No contract = 4, C1 = 10, C2 = 5
Player 2's payoffs: No contract = 4, C1 = 10, C2 = 15

Player 2 prefers C2 > C1 > none. They will likely approve C2 (and possibly both).

If I approve only C1 and they approve C2:
- C1: 1 approval, C2: 1 approval → 50-50 chance
- Expected payoff: 0.5(10) + 0.5(5) = **7.5**

If I approve both C1 and C2 and they approve C2:
- C1: 1 approval, C2: 2 approvals → C2 wins
- Payoff: **5**

If I approve both C1 and C2 and they approve both:
- C1: 2 approvals, C2: 2 approvals → 50-50 chance
- Expected payoff: **7.5**

By approving only C1, I maximize my expected payoff regardless of whether Player 2 approves only C2 or both contracts.

{"C1": true, "C2": false}

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To evaluate whether to sign the contract, we need to carefully consider how the contract affects the payoffs of different actions. We will break down the analysis into clear steps:

1. **Understand the Basic Payoff Matrix:**
   We are Player 2, and the initial payoffs are as follows:
   - (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 10 points, Player 1 gets 10 points.
   - (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 20 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
   - (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 2 points, Player 1 gets 6 points.
   - (A1, A1): Player 2 gets 4 points, Player 1 gets 4 points.

2. **Examine the Proposed Contract:**
   The contract specifies that a player playing A0 receives an additional 10 points, drawn equally from the other player. So, effectively:
   - If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 2 gains an additional 10 points, Player 1 loses 5 points (equal contribution for Player 2's gain).

3. **Calculate the New Payoffs with the Contract:**
   Given the contract:
   - (A0, A0):
     - Player 2: 10 (original) + 10 (contract) = 20
     - Player 1: 10 (original) - 5 (for Player 2's contract gain) + 10 (for their own contract gain) - 5 (for Player 2's gain) = 10
   - (A1, A0):
     - Player 2: 20 (original)
     - Player 1: 0 (original) - 5 (for Player 2's contract gain, since they chose A0)
   - (A0, A1):
     - Player 2: 2 (original) + 10 (contract) = 12
     - Player 1: 6 (original) - 5 (for Player 2's contract gain)
   - (A1, A1):
     - Player 2: 4 (original)
     - Player 1: 4 (original)

4. **Summary of New Payoffs with Contract:**
   - (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 10.
   - (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets -5.
   - (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 12, Player 1 gets 1.
   - (A1, A1): Player 2 gets 4, Player 1 gets 4.

5. **Evaluate Potential Outcomes:**
   By signing the contract, Player 2 secures an additional 10 points if choosing A0, regardless of Player 1's action:
   - If Player 2 chooses A0, the lowest payoff is 12 points (compared to the original lowest payoff of 2 points without the contract).
   - If Player 2 chooses A1, no additional payment or penalty is incurred, keeping the points the same as the original.

6. **Strategic Consideration:**
   Signing the contract aligns incentives towards both players choosing A0:
   - When both choose A0, Player 2 will receive 20 points instead of 10 points.

Given these considerations, the contract shifts the balance positively in favor of Player 2, especially when choosing A0.

### Conclusion:
Signing the contract maximizes Player 2's potential benefits across different scenarios compared to not signing it. Therefore, Player 2 should sign the contract.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

**Original Payoff Matrix (My payoff, Their payoff):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Finding equilibrium without contract:**
- For Player 2: A1 dominates A0 (they get 20 vs 10 if I play A0, and 4 vs 2 if I play A1)
- So Player 2 will play A1
- Given Player 2 plays A1, I should play A1 (getting 4 vs 0)
- **Equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

**Contract effect:** 
- If a player chooses A0: they get +10, the other player pays -10
- If a player chooses A1: no payments

**Modified Payoff Matrix WITH contract:**
- (A0, A0): (10+10-10, 10+10-10) = (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0+10-0, 20+0-10) = (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (6+0-10, 2+10-0) = (-4, 12)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Finding equilibrium with contract:**
- For me (Player 1): A0 dominates A1 (I get 10 vs -4 if they play A0, and 10 vs 4 if they play A1)
- So I will play A0
- Given I play A0, Player 2 gets 10 from both A0 and A1 (indifferent)
- **Equilibrium: (A0, A0) or (A0, A1) → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** I get 4 points
- **With contract:** I get 10 points

Since 10 > 4, I should sign the contract.

**Note:** Player 2 should also sign because they get 10 points with the contract versus 4 points without it, so the contract benefits both players.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Understand the Original Game (Without Contract)

The payoff matrix from my perspective as Player 2:

|  | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Me: A0** | 10, 10 | 2, 6 |
| **Me: A1** | 20, 0 | 4, 4 |

Analyzing dominant strategies:
- **For me (Player 2):** A1 gives me 20 > 10 when opponent plays A0, and 4 > 2 when opponent plays A1. **A1 strictly dominates A0**.
- **For Player 1:** When I play A1, they prefer A1 (4 points) over A0 (0 points).

**Nash Equilibrium without contract:** (A1, A1) → **I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Understand the Contract Effects

The contract modifies payoffs:
- Playing A0: receive +5 points (from opponent)
- Playing A1: pay -5 points (to opponent)

Net transfers in each scenario:
- (A0, A0): I receive 5, opponent receives 5 → net transfers cancel (0)
- (A1, A0): I pay 5, opponent receives 5 → **I pay 5 net**
- (A0, A1): I receive 5, opponent pays 5 → **I receive 5 net**
- (A1, A1): Both pay 5 → net transfers cancel (0)

## Step 3: Calculate Modified Payoffs WITH Contract

|  | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Me: A0** | 10 + 0 = 10 | 2 + 5 = 7 |
| **Me: A1** | 20 - 5 = 15 | 4 + 0 = 4 |

For Player 1's payoffs:
|  | Me: A0 | Me: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Player 1: A0** | 10 | 1 |
| **Player 1: A1** | 5 | 4 |

## Step 4: Analyze Game WITH Contract

- **For Player 1:** A0 gives 10 > 1 and 5 > 4. **A0 strictly dominates A1**.
- **For me (Player 2):** If Player 1 plays A0 (their dominant strategy), I prefer A1 (15 points) over A0 (10 points).

**Nash Equilibrium with contract:** (A1, A0) → **I get 15 points**

## Step 5: Compare Outcomes

- **WITHOUT contract:** 4 points
- **WITH contract:** 15 points

**Benefit of signing:** 15 - 4 = **+11 points**

## Conclusion

Signing the contract dramatically increases my expected payoff from 4 to 15 points. This is clearly advantageous.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs

Original payoff matrix (my payoff, other player's payoff):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

## Step 2: Analyze the original game equilibrium

For me (Player 1):
- If they play A0: I get 10 from A0 vs 6 from A1 → prefer A0
- If they play A1: I get 0 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A1

For Player 2:
- If I play A0: They get 10 from A0 vs 20 from A1 → prefer A1
- If I play A1: They get 2 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A1

Player 2 has a dominant strategy: A1. Given this, I should play A1.
**Original equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs under Contract 1

C1: Player choosing A0 receives 10 points from the other player.

- (A0, A0): (10 + 10 - 10, 10 + 10 - 10) = (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 10, 20 - 10) = (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (6 - 10, 2 + 10) = (-4, 12)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

## Step 4: Calculate payoffs under Contract 2

C2: Player choosing A1 pays 10 points to the other player.

- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 10, 20 - 10) = (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (6 - 10, 2 + 10) = (-4, 12)
- (A1, A1): (4 - 10 + 10, 4 - 10 + 10) = (4, 4)

**C1 and C2 produce identical payoffs!**

## Step 5: Analyze equilibrium under C1/C2

For me:
- If they play A0: I get 10 from A0 vs -4 from A1 → strongly prefer A0
- If they play A1: I get 10 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A0

**A0 is now my dominant strategy!**

For Player 2 (given I play A0):
- They get 10 from A0 vs 10 from A1 → indifferent

**Under C1 or C2: I play A0 and get 10 points** (regardless of what Player 2 does)

## Step 6: Compare outcomes

- Original game: 4 points
- C1 implemented: 10 points
- C2 implemented: 10 points

Both contracts improve my payoff from 4 to 10 points. Both contracts also improve Player 2's payoff from 4 to 10 points, so they should rationally approve both as well.

I should approve both contracts to maximize the chance that one is implemented.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoffs with the contract

The contract states that choosing A0 gives +12 points, drawn from the other player. Let me compute the net payoffs for each outcome:

**Case 1: I choose A0, Other chooses A0**
- Base payoff: 10
- I get +12 from contract, Other also gets +12 from contract
- Net: 10 + 12 - 12 = **10 points**

**Case 2: I choose A0, Other chooses A1**
- Base payoff: 0
- I get +12 from contract (drawn from Other)
- Net: 0 + 12 = **12 points**

**Case 3: I choose A1, Other chooses A0**
- Base payoff: 6
- Other gets +12 from contract (drawn from me)
- Net: 6 - 12 = **-6 points**

**Case 4: I choose A1, Other chooses A1**
- Base payoff: 4
- No contract payments
- Net: **4 points**

## Step 2: Create my payoff matrix

```
              Other plays A0    Other plays A1
I play A0           10                12
I play A1           -6                 4
```

## Step 3: Determine optimal strategy

Comparing my payoffs:
- If Other plays A0: A0 gives me 10, A1 gives me -6 → **A0 is better**
- If Other plays A1: A0 gives me 12, A1 gives me 4 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** regardless of what the other player does!

The contract makes A0 significantly more attractive. Even in the worst case (both play A0), I get 10 points. Playing A1 when Other plays A0 gives me -6 points, which is terrible.

## Step 4: Final decision

Since A0 is always better than A1, my optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To find the optimal strategy for Player 2, we first analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating the penalty/reward contract into the original game.

### 1. Identify Original Payoffs (P1, P2)
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### 2. Apply the Contract Adjustments
The contract states:
- A player choosing A0 receives +5, while the other player loses 5.
- A player choosing A1 pays 5, while the other player receives 5.

**Calculating adjustments:**
- **(A0, A0):** P1 adjustment = +5 - 5 = 0; P2 adjustment = +5 - 5 = 0.
  Final: (10, 10)
- **(A0, A1) (P1=A0, P2=A1):** P1 adjustment = +5 + 5 = +10; P2 adjustment = -5 - 5 = -10.
  Final: (0 + 10, 20 - 10) = (10, 10)
- **(A1, A0) (P1=A1, P2=A0):** P1 adjustment = -5 - 5 = -10; P2 adjustment = +5 + 5 = +10.
  Final: (6 - 10, 2 + 10) = (-4, 12)
- **(A1, A1):** P1 adjustment = -5 + 5 = 0; P2 adjustment = -5 + 5 = 0.
  Final: (4, 4)

### 3. Revised Payoff Matrix
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---:|:---:|:---:|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10) | (10, 10) |
| **P1: A1** | (-4, 12) | (4, 4) |

### 4. Strategic Analysis
- **For Player 1 (Row):** Choosing A0 gives a payoff of 10 regardless of what Player 2 chooses (10 vs -4 if P2=A0; 10 vs 4 if P2=A1). A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1.
- **For Player 2 (Column):** 
  - If Player 1 plays A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 10. (Indifferent)
  - If Player 1 plays A1: A0 gives 12, A1 gives 4. (Prefers A0)
- Player 2 has a weakly dominant strategy of A0. If there is even a small chance that Player 1 might make a mistake and play A1, A0 is the strictly better choice (12 vs 4). Given Player 1's incentives, they are expected to play A0. In this case, A0 results in a stable equilibrium of (10, 10).

Since A0 is both safer and provides a higher potential payoff if the other player deviates, it is the optimal choice.

To determine the optimal probability distribution over the actions A0 and A1 in this game, we need to consider both the original payoffs and the additional payments specified in the contract.

Let's break down the expected payoffs for each action:

### Payoff Matrix (Without Contract)
| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Payoff | Other Player's Payoff |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| A0          | A0                  | 10          | 10                    |
| A0          | A1                  | 0           | 20                    |
| A1          | A0                  | 6           | 2                     |
| A1          | A1                  | 4           | 4                     |

### Additional Payments (From Contract)
- If you choose A0, you get an additional 5 points from the other player (who loses 5 points).
- If you choose A1, you lose 5 points to the other player (who gains 5 points).

### Payoff Matrix (With Contract)
| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Payoff | Other Player's Payoff |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| A0          | A0                  | 15          | 5                     |
| A0          | A1                  | 5           | 15                    |
| A1          | A0                  | 1           | 7                     |
| A1          | A1                  | -1          | 9                     |

Now that we have the adjusted payoffs, we can analyze the best strategy by comparing the expected payoffs for each action assuming the other player is rational.

### Expected Payoff for Action A0 and A1
Let \( p \) be the probability that the other player chooses A0, and \( 1 - p \) be the probability that the other player chooses A1.

**For A0:**
\[ \text{Expected Payoff for A0} = 15p + 5(1-p) \]
\[ = 15p + 5 - 5p \]
\[ = 10p + 5 \]

**For A1:**
\[ \text{Expected Payoff for A1} = 1p + (-1)(1-p) \]
\[ = p - 1 + p \]
\[ = 2p - 1 \]

To maximize your points, you would choose the action with the higher expected payoff given your opponent's probability \( p \) of choosing A0:

\[ 10p + 5 > 2p - 1 \]
\[ 10p + 5 > 2p - 1 \]
\[ 8p > -6 \]
\[ p > -\frac{3}{4} \]

Since \( p \) represents a probability, it lies between 0 and 1. Therefore, this inequality \( p > -\frac{3}{4} \) is always true for any valid probability distribution.

Given that the payoff for A0 generally seems higher and it aligns more with Pareto efficiency (beneficial for you both), it makes more sense to select A0 more often than A1. Therefore, from a probabilistic perspective, we should assign a higher probability to A0 while still maintaining some level of unpredictability.

### Final Probabilities
To achieve some balance and randomness, I might favor A0 but still choose A1 occasionally. A reasonable distribution could be:
\[ \text{p(A0)} = 80\% \]
\[ \text{p(A1)} = 20\% \]

Let's encode this into a valid JSON object.

```json
{
    "A0": 80,
    "A1": 20
}
```

This distribution ensures that I am primarily leveraging the higher expected payoff of A0, while keeping some unpredictability in my strategy.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy, let's analyze the game by incorporating the payment contract into the original payoff matrix. 

### 1. Analysis of Original Payoffs
You are Player 2. The original payoffs (P1, P2) are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20) — *Other player (P1) chooses A0, you (P2) choose A1*
- (A1, A0): (6, 2) — *Other player (P1) chooses A1, you (P2) choose A0*
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### 2. Impact of the Contract
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 12 points from the other player.
- If both choose A0, the payments cancel out (+12 - 12 = 0).

**Adjusted Payoffs with Contract:**
- **(A0, A0):** Both receive +12 and pay +12. Net change = 0.
  - P1: 10 + 0 = **10**, P2: 10 + 0 = **10**
- **(P1=A0, P2=A1):** P1 receives 12 from P2.
  - P1: 0 + 12 = **12**, P2: 20 - 12 = **8**
- **(P1=A1, P2=A0):** P2 receives 12 from P1.
  - P1: 6 - 12 = **-6**, P2: 2 + 12 = **14**
- **(P1=A1, P2=A1):** No A0 is chosen, so no payments.
  - P1: **4**, P2: **4**

### 3. Strategy Evaluation (Player 2 - You)
- If Player 1 chooses **A0**: Your payoff for A0 is **10**, and for A1 is **8**. (A0 is better)
- If Player 1 chooses **A1**: Your payoff for A0 is **14**, and for A1 is **4**. (A0 is better)
**A0 is a dominant strategy for you.**

### 4. Strategy Evaluation (Player 1 - Other)
- If You (P2) choose **A0**: Player 1's payoff for A0 is **10**, and for A1 is **-6**. (A0 is better)
- If You (P2) choose **A1**: Player 1's payoff for A0 is **12**, and for A1 is **4**. (A0 is better)
**A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 1.**

### 5. Conclusion
With both players having A0 as their dominant strategy, the Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), yielding 10 points for each player. Diverging to A1 is suboptimal regardless of the other player's actions, as the contract rewards choosing A0 and penalizes playing against A0.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

**My payoffs (Player 1):**
- If I play A0 and they play A0: 10
- If I play A0 and they play A1: 0
- If I play A1 and they play A0: 6
- If I play A1 and they play A1: 4

**Player 2's payoffs:**
- If I play A0 and they play A0: 10
- If I play A0 and they play A1: 20
- If I play A1 and they play A0: 2
- If I play A1 and they play A1: 4

**Finding the Nash Equilibrium:**
- From Player 2's perspective: A1 dominates A0 regardless of what I play (20 > 10 if I play A0, and 4 > 2 if I play A1)
- Knowing they'll play A1, my best response is A1 (4 > 0)
- **Nash Equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- +10 points to whoever plays A0 (paid by the other player)

**New payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): I get 10 + 10 - 10 = **10**
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 10 = **10**
- (A1, A0): I get 6 - 10 = **-4**
- (A1, A1): I get **4**

**Finding the Nash Equilibrium:**
- From my perspective: A0 strictly dominates A1 (10 > -4 and 10 > 4)
- I will always play A0
- Given I play A0, Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give them 10)
- **New equilibrium: I play A0, they play A0 or A1 → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** I expect 4 points
- **With contract:** I expect 10 points (guaranteed with my dominant strategy A0)

The contract increases my expected payoff by 6 points (from 4 to 10), and also benefits Player 2 (also going from 4 to 10), so they should sign as well.

## Conclusion

I should sign the contract.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoff matrix with the contract

The contract states that choosing A0 gives +10 points from the other player.

Let me calculate my payoffs (Player 1) in each scenario:

**When I choose A0, Other chooses A0:**
- Base: 10 points
- I get +10 for choosing A0
- I pay -10 for other choosing A0
- **Total: 10 points**

**When I choose A0, Other chooses A1:**
- Base: 0 points
- I get +10 for choosing A0
- No payment for other choosing A1
- **Total: 10 points**

**When I choose A1, Other chooses A0:**
- Base: 6 points
- I pay -10 for other choosing A0
- **Total: -4 points**

**When I choose A1, Other chooses A1:**
- Base: 4 points
- No payments
- **Total: 4 points**

## Step 2: My payoff matrix with contract

```
                Other's Choice
                A0      A1
My A0           10      10
   A1           -4      4
```

## Step 3: Analyze dominant strategy

If the other player chooses A0:
- A0 gives me 10 points
- A1 gives me -4 points
- **A0 is better**

If the other player chooses A1:
- A0 gives me 10 points
- A1 gives me 4 points
- **A0 is better**

## Step 4: Conclusion

**A0 is a strictly dominant strategy** - it gives me a higher payoff regardless of what the other player does. I always get 10 points with A0, compared to at most 4 points (and potentially -4 points) with A1.

To maximize my expected points, I should choose A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
First, let's break down the game scenario and its implications:

### Payoff Table:

| You/Other Player | A0     | A1     |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0**           | 10, 10 | 2, 6   |
| **A1**           | 20, 0  | 4, 4   |

### Contract Adjustments:

According to the contract:
- If a player chooses A0, they get an additional 10 points taken equally from the other player.

### Adjusted Payoff Table:

| You/Other Player | A0     | A1     |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0**           | 20, 0  | 12, -4 |
| **A1**           | 10, -10| 4, 4   |

This adjustment affects the motivation of choosing A0 versus A1. 

### Analysis:

1. **When both choose A0**:
   - You: 20 points
   - Other Player: 0 points

2. **When you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1**:
   - You: 12 points
   - Other Player: -4 points

3. **When you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0**:
   - You: 10 points
   - Other Player: -10 points

4. **When both choose A1**:
   - You: 4 points
   - Other Player: 4 points

### Strategy to Maximize Your Payoff:

Looking at the adjusted payoffs:
- The max payoff for you is 20 points.
- To achieve 20 points, you must choose A0, but the other player also must choose A0.

This creates a dynamic where cooperation would be ideal, but from both players' perspectives, the temptation to choose A1 (to potentially exploit) exists. Nevertheless, choosing A1 can lead to a more balanced but lower payoff for both sides (especially 4 points each).

Given the current payoffs, the rational decision would likely dissolve to mixed strategies if both parties are fairly rational. If, however, the other player recognizes that mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) maximizes the total payoff for both (because they believe you will always choose A0), then your response might also be to choose A0.

### Probabilistic Choice:

Given these considerations, let's propose a probability distribution:
- High probability on A0, due to its significant payoff if the other player cooperates.
  
Final Decision:
```json
{"A0": 70, "A1": 30}
```

Explanation:
- **A0 at 70%**: Reflects a higher likelihood to aim for the higher, cooperative payoff.
- **A1 at 30%**: Reflects some probability of choosing a diversifying strategy to balance the potential rational exploit by the other player.

Thus, balancing expected rewards and potential rational behaviors leads to a probabilistic distribution favoring mutual cooperation but accounting for a strategic element.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs

Without contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 10, other gets 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 20  
- (A1, A0): I get 6, other gets 2
- (A1, A1): I get 4, other gets 4

## Step 2: Analyze the original game equilibrium

For me:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 6 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 0, A1 gives 4 → prefer A1

For the other player:
- If I play A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 20 → prefer A1
- If I play A1: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4 → prefer A1

The other player has a dominant strategy: A1. Given this, I should play A1.
**Nash equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs with the contract

The contract adds:
- +10 points to whoever plays A0 (paid by the other player)
- 0 for A1

New payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 10+10-10 = **10**, other gets 10+10-10 = 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0+10-0 = **10**, other gets 20+0-10 = 10
- (A1, A0): I get 6+0-10 = **-4**, other gets 2+10-0 = 12
- (A1, A1): I get 4+0-0 = **4**, other gets 4+0-0 = 4

## Step 4: Analyze equilibrium with the contract

For me:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives -4 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 4 → prefer A0

**A0 is now my dominant strategy!**

For the other player (given I'll play A0):
- If I play A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 10 → indifferent

**With contract: I play A0 and get 10 points (regardless of what other does)**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** I get 4 points
- **With contract:** I get 10 points

The contract increases my payoff from 4 to 10 points. I should definitely sign it.

(Note: The other player also improves from 4 to 10, so they should sign too)

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the baseline game (no contract)

From my perspective as Player 2:
```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Player 2  A0    10      2
          A1    20      4
```

Finding the Nash equilibrium:
- For me: A1 dominates A0 (I get 20 vs 10 if P1 plays A0, and 4 vs 2 if P1 plays A1)
- Given I'll play A1, Player 1 prefers A1 (gets 4) over A0 (gets 0)
- **Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (Player 1's proposal)

Contract 1: Players choosing A0 get +10 from the other player.

Modified payoff matrix:
```
                Player 1
                A0          A1
Player 2  A0    10          2+10=12
          A1    20-10=10    4
```

When both play A0: Each gets 10 (base) + 10 (for choosing A0) - 10 (other player's A0) = 10

For Player 1:
```
                Player 2
                A0      A1
Player 1  A0    10      10
          A1    -4      4
```

- (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium: I'm indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give 10), but Player 1 strictly prefers A0 over A1 (10 > -4)
- **Expected outcome: I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (my proposal)

Contract 2: Players choosing A1 pay -10 to the other player.

This creates the same relative incentives as Contract 1! 

Modified payoff matrix:
```
                Player 1
                A0          A1
Player 2  A0    10          2+10=12
          A1    20-10=10    4
```

This is identical to Contract 1's payoff matrix.
- **Expected outcome: I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **No contract:** I get 4 points
- **Contract 1:** I get 10 points (+6 improvement)
- **Contract 2:** I get 10 points (+6 improvement)

Both contracts shift the equilibrium from (A1, A1) to (A0, A0), increasing my payoff from 4 to 10 points. Both are equally beneficial to me.

**I should approve both contracts.**

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Calculate adjusted payoffs with the contract

First, let me determine my actual payoffs including the contract effects. The contract states:
- Choosing A0: receive +5 from the other player
- Choosing A1: pay -5 to the other player

For each outcome:

**(A0, A0)**: Base payoff 10 + 5 (I receive for A0) - 5 (I pay for their A0) = **10**

**(A0, A1)**: Base payoff 2 + 5 (I receive for A0) + 5 (I receive from their A1) = **12**

**(A1, A0)**: Base payoff 20 - 5 (I pay for A1) - 5 (I pay for their A0) = **10**

**(A1, A1)**: Base payoff 4 - 5 (I pay for A1) + 5 (I receive from their A1) = **4**

My adjusted payoff matrix:
```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Me (Player 2)
A0              10      12
A1              10      4
```

## Step 2: Analyze Player 1's incentives

Similarly calculating for Player 1:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): -10
- (A0, A1): 16  
- (A1, A1): 4

Player 1's strategy: A0 strictly dominates A1 (10 > -10 and 16 > 4)

Therefore, Player 1 will play **A0 with probability 1**.

## Step 3: Determine my best response

Given Player 1 will play A0:
- If I play A0: I get 10
- If I play A1: I get 10

I'm technically indifferent. However:
- A0 weakly dominates A1 (equal payoff vs A0, better payoff vs A1: 12 > 4)
- If there's any chance Player 1 deviates to A1, A0 gives me 12 instead of 4
- A0 is the safer, equilibrium strategy

## Step 4: Conclusion

The Nash equilibrium is both players choosing A0. This maximizes my expected payoff given rational play.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the actual payoffs including the contract

The contract adds payments: choosing A0 gives +10 points from the other player.

Let me compute the final payoffs (my points, other's points):

- **Both A0**: Base (10, 10) + I get +10 from other - I pay -10 to other = **(10, 10)**
- **I play A0, other A1**: Base (0, 20) + I get +10 from other = **(10, 10)**
- **I play A1, other A0**: Base (6, 2) - I pay -10 to other = **(-4, 12)**
- **Both A1**: Base (4, 4) + no contract payments = **(4, 4)**

## Step 2: Analyze my payoffs

My payoff matrix simplified:
- If I choose **A0**: I get **10 points** (regardless of what the other player does!)
- If I choose **A1**: I get either **-4 points** (if other plays A0) or **4 points** (if other plays A1)

## Step 3: Determine optimal strategy

Let's say the other player chooses A0 with probability p.

- Expected payoff from **A0**: 10 × p + 10 × (1-p) = **10**
- Expected payoff from **A1**: -4 × p + 4 × (1-p) = 4 - 8p

Since 4 - 8p ≤ 4 for any p ≥ 0, we have:
- A0 gives: 10
- A1 gives at most: 4

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - it gives me a higher payoff regardless of what the other player does.

## Step 4: Conclusion

Since A0 gives me 10 points no matter what, while A1 gives me at most 4 points (and potentially -4), my optimal strategy is to always choose A0.

First, I need to fully understand the initial game's payoff matrix and then analyze both proposed contracts to determine whether approving them would maximize my expected points.

### Initial Game Analysis

#### Payoff Matrix:
|          | Opponent: A0 | Opponent: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| You: A0  | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)       |
| You: A1  | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

Focusing on my payoffs as Player 2:
- A0 vs. A0: 10 points
- A1 vs. A0: 20 points
- A0 vs. A1: 2 points
- A1 vs. A1: 4 points

### Evaluating the Proposed Contracts

#### Contract proposed by Player 1:
- A0: +15 points (drawn equally from the other player)
- A1: no change

Adjusting payoffs for Contract 1:
|          | Opponent: A0 | Opponent: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| You: A0  | (25, -5)     | (17, -9)     |
| You: A1  | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

Here, Player 1:
- Gains +15 points for choosing A0
- Loses -15 points for choosing A1
- A0: -5 points for Player 1 (supposed)

Player 2 (me):
- Gains +15 points for choosing A0
- A0 vs. A0: (25, -5)
- A1 vs. A0: (20, 0)
- A0 vs. A1: (17, -9)
- A1 vs. A1: (4, 4)

#### Contract proposed by Player 2:
- A0: +5 points (drawn equally from the other player)
- A1: no change

Adjusting payoffs for Contract 2:
|          | Opponent: A0 | Opponent: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| You: A0  | (15, 5)      | (7, 4)       |
| You: A1  | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

Here, Player 2 (me):
- Gains +5 points for A0
- Losses -5 points for A0 (from Player 1):
  
NEW:
Player 2:
- A0 vs. A0: (15, 5)
- A1 vs. A0: (20, 0)
- A0 vs. A1: (7, 4)
- A1 vs. A1: (4, 4)

## Decision Making
The final step is to decide which contract(s) I approve, aiming to maximize my total points.

### Contract 1 Analysis:
- A0 vs. A0: +25 points
- A1 vs. A0: +20 points
Compared with:
- A0 vs. A1: -17 points
- A1 vs. A1: 0 points.

### Contract 2 Analysis:
- A0 vs. A0: +15 points
- A0 vs. A1: +12 points compared too
- A1: still +20 points

Final Optimizing Point Considerations:
- Optimal strategies & Stability - confirmed Contract 1 provides negative points for P1

Approving C2 only, avoid unfairness and top risk

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base payoffs
From my perspective (Player 1), the base payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Apply the contract
The contract states: If a player chooses A0, they receive +10 points from the other player.

This means:
- If I choose A0: I receive +10
- If the other player chooses A0: I pay -10

## Step 3: Calculate modified payoffs
My actual payoffs with the contract:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 (I get for A0) - 10 (I pay for other's A0) = **10**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 10 (I get for A0) - 0 = **10**
- (A1, A0): 6 + 0 - 10 (I pay for other's A0) = **-4**
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = **4**

## Step 4: Analyze strategy
Compare my expected payoffs:
- If I play A0: I get 10 regardless of what the other player does
- If I play A1: I get either -4 (if other plays A0) or 4 (if other plays A1)

Since:
- 10 > 4 (best case for A1)
- 10 > -4 (worst case for A1)

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - it gives me a better payoff no matter what the other player does.

## Step 5: Optimal strategy
Since A0 is strictly dominant, I should always choose A0.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

We are Player 2 in a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

The payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) are:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| P2: A0   | (10, 10) | (2, 6) |
| P2: A1   | (20, 0) | (4, 4) |

We will analyze this base game to understand the Nash equilibria.

---

### **Step 2: Find Best Responses (Base Game)**

**Player 2’s best responses:**

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - P2 chooses A0 → 10
  - P2 chooses A1 → 0
  - So best response: A0

- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - P2 chooses A0 → 6
  - P2 chooses A1 → 4
  - So best response: A0

→ **Player 2’s best response is always A0**, regardless of what Player 1 does.

So Player 2 has a dominant strategy: **A0**

Now check Player 1:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1: A0 → 10
  - P1: A1 → 20
  - Best: A1

- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1: A0 → 2
  - P1: A1 → 4
  - Best: A1

→ **Player 1’s best response is always A1**

So both players have a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium: **(A1, A0)**

→ Expected outcome if no contract: P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → Payoffs: (2, 6)

But this is **only** if they play optimally. However, the contract might change incentives.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contract**

The contract being proposed:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, **drawn equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 points, **distributed equally among the other players**.

So:
- Choosing A0: +5, paid by others.
- Choosing A1: –5, paid *to* others.

But **"drawn equally from the other players"** means:  
- If you choose A0, you get +5, and the cost is split equally among all other players.
- If you choose A1, you pay –5, and the cost is distributed equally to other players.

But wait: Since this is just **one other player**, the **other player** is the only one who pays or receives.

So for **you (Player 2)**:
- If you choose A0: you get +5, and Player 1 pays 5/1 = 5 → so you gain 5, Player 1 loses 5.
- If you choose A1: you pay –5, and Player 1 receives 5 → so you lose 5, Player 1 gains 5.

Similarly, for Player 1:
- If P1 chooses A0: gets +5, P2 pays 5.
- If P1 chooses A1: pays –5, P2 gets 5.

This is equivalent to transferring 5 points **from the non-A0 chooser to the A0 chooser**.

So the **contract is symmetric**: A0 gets 5 from whoever chooses A1.

---

### **Step 4: Modify Payoffs with Contract (if signed)**

We are considering whether to sign the contract. The contract is active **only if both players sign**.

Let’s compute the total payoff **net of contract**.

Assume both sign → contract applies.

Now recalculate payoffs (Player 1, Player 2), including contract.

#### Case 1: (A0, A0)

- Base: (10, 10)
- Contract: both choose A0 → each gets +5 from the other (since the other is not choosing A1)
  - So each gains +5
- Final: (15, 15)

Wait: Is this correct?

Let’s re-read:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So if **both** choose A0:
- Each gets +5 from the other player? But the "other players" is one.

So each receives 5 from the other → so both get +5.

→ Yes: (15, 15)

#### Case 2: (A1, A0)

- Base: (20, 0)
- Contract:
  - P1 chooses A1 → pays –5 → P2 gets +5
  - P2 chooses A0 → gets +5 → P1 pays 5
  - So net:
    - P1: 20 (base) – 5 (contract payment) = 15
    - P2: 0 (base) + 5 (from itself) + 5 (from P1) = 10
    → (15, 10)

Wait: P2 chooses A0 → gets +5 → from P1
P1 chooses A1 → pays –5 → gives to P2

So P1 loses 5, P2 gains 5 from contract

→ P1: 20 – 5 = 15  
→ P2: 0 + 5 + 5 = 10

Yes: (15, 10)

#### Case 3: (A0, A1)

- Base: (2, 6)
- Contract:
  - P1 chooses A0 → gets +5 → P2 pays 5
  - P2 chooses A1 → pays –5 → P1 gets 5
  - So:
    - P1: 2 + 5 (from A0) + 5 (from P2) = 12
    - P2: 6 – 5 (from A1) – 5 (from P1 paying) = –4? No!

Wait — no: it says the payment is **distributed equally among other players**.

So:
- If you choose A0 → you get +5, paid by other players → so other player(s) pay 5 total.
- If you choose A1 → you pay –5, so other player(s) receive 5 total.

So in (A0, A1):
- P1: A0 → gets +5 → receives 5 from P2
- P2: A1 → pays –5 → gives 5 to P1

So P1: 2 + 5 = 7  
P2: 6 – 5 = 1

Final: (7, 1)

Wait — but the contract is symmetric: the net transfer is **from A1 to A0 chooser**.

So in this case: P1 (A0) gets +5; P2 (A1) pays –5 → so transfer is 5 from P2 to P1.

Thus:
- P1: 2 + 5 = 7
- P2: 6 – 5 = 1

Yes.

#### Case 4: (A1, A1)

- Base: (4, 4)
- Contract:
  - Both choose A1 → both pay –5 → each gives 5 to the other?
  - But the statement: "distributed equally among the other players"

So:
- P1 chooses A1 → pays –5 → the 5 is distributed to other players → only P2 → so P2 gets +5
- P2 chooses A1 → pays –5 → P1 gets +5

So both net:
- P1: 4 – 5 + 5 = 4
- P2: 4 – 5 + 5 = 4

→ (4, 4)

Wait — the +5 and –5 cancel? Yes.

So final payoffs under contract:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1        |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| P2: A0   | (15, 15) | (15, 10)       |
| P2: A1   | (7, 1)   | (4, 4)         |

---

### **Step 5: Analyze the Game with Contract**

Let’s see the incentive structure.

We are Player 2.

We now compute Player 2’s payoffs under contract:

- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 15 (if A0) vs 7 (if A1) → better to play A0
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → better to play A0

→ So **A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 2 under the contract**

Now check Player 1:

- If P2 plays A0 → P1: 15 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → indifferent
- If P2 plays A1 → P1: 7 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → better to play A0

So Player 1’s best response:
- Against P2’s A0: A0 and A1 both give 15 → indifferent
- Against P2’s A1: A0 is better (7 > 4)

→ So P1 prefers A0, especially if P2 plays A1

Now, what are the Nash equilibria under contract?

Try (A0, A0):  
- P1: A0 → 15, A1 → 15 → indifferent → can stick to A0  
- P2: A0 → 15, A1 → 7 → better to stay with A0

So (A0, A0) is Nash.

Try (A0, A1):  
- P1: A1 → 15, but if switch to A0 → 15 → indifferent → could stay
- P2: A1 → 1, but if switch to A0 → 10 → better → so will deviate

So not Nash.

Try (A1, A0):  
- P2: A0 → 10, but if switch to A1 → 4 → worse → stays
- P1: A1 → 15, A0 → 15 → indifferent → could stay

So (A1, A0) is also Nash? But if P1 is playing A1 and P2 playing A0, then P1 is indifferent → OK.

But P2 is playing A0, which gives P2 10, which is better than 4 from A1 → so P2 won’t deviate.

So (A1, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But now: **if both players are rational and expect each other to follow a strategy, which one will they settle into?**

But both (A0, A0) and (A1, A0) are Nash.

But in **(A0, A0)**, both get 15.

In **(A1, A0)**, P1 gets 15, P2 gets 10.

→ So **P2 gets more in (A0, A0)**.

But is (A0, A0) a focal point? Maybe.

But now, **would Player 1 want to sign the contract?**

We are only deciding **whether to sign**.

We need to ask: **If I sign, what happens?**

- If **both sign**, we play the contract game → P2’s payoff depends on what both do.

- If I **do not sign**, then no contract → we play original game → P2’s payoff depends.

But the contract is only active if **both sign**.

So if I **do not sign**, **contract is not active** → we play base game.

So we must compare:
- My expected payoff **if I sign and contract is active** (assuming P1 also signs)
- My expected payoff **if I don’t sign** (contract inactive)

But **we don’t know what P1 will do**.

But we are to **decide whether to sign** — assuming rational play.

Let’s suppose I sign. Then P1 can choose to sign or not.

But the contract is activated **only if both sign**.

So if I sign, and P1 does not, then **contract is inactive**, and we go back to base game.

Similarly, if I don’t sign, no contract regardless.

So my decision to sign can only result in contract being active **if P1 also signs**.

So to decide whether to sign, I must evaluate:

- What is my best response in the contract game?
- And what are the implications?

Let’s compute **expected payoff under contract** **if both sign**, assuming rational play.

As we saw, both (A0, A0) and (A1, A0) are Nash equilibria.

But **in (A0, A0)**: P2 gets 15

In (A1, A0)**: P2 gets 10

P2 prefers (A0, A0) — 15 > 10

But can we coordinate on (A0, A0)?

But P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 when P2 plays A0.

So if P2 plays A0, P1 is indifferent → P1 might play A0 for safety, or A1.

But in the base game, P1 would play A1.

Now with contract, P1 has no incentive to deviate from A0 if P2 plays A0.

But P1 might expect P2 to play A0 (since A0 is dominant for P2), so P1 can play A0 safely.

In fact, since P2 has a dominant strategy of A0 (under contract), P1 knows that P2 will play A0 → so P1 can play A0 (or A1, same payoffs) — but P1 would prefer to play A0 to avoid risk of instability?

But actually, since both A0 and A1 give P1 same payoff when P2 plays A0 (both 15), P1 is indifferent.

So the **most reasonable outcome is that both play A0**, giving (15,15)

Alternatively, if they don’t coordinate, they might end up in (A1, A0), but that gives P2 only 10 — worse.

But we are to assume **rational players who coordinate on equilibria**.

So **if both sign**, rational players will likely converge to **(A0, A0)**, since it's better for both and both can achieve it.

So under contract, expected payoff for **P2**: 15

Now, what if I do **not sign**?

Then no contract → base game.

In base game:
- P1’s dominant strategy: A1
- P2’s dominant strategy: A0

→ So (A1, A0) → P2 gets 6

So if I don’t sign, I get **6**

If I sign, and assuming P1 also signs, I get **15**

So **15 > 6** → better to sign.

But **what if P1 doesn’t sign**?

If I sign, but P1 doesn’t, then **contract is inactive**, and we play base game.

But in that case, the outcome is still (A1, A0) → P2 gets 6

But if I **don’t sign**, same thing: contract not active → P2 gets 6

So whether I sign or not, if P1 doesn’t sign, I get 6.

But:

- If I sign **and** P1 signs → I get 15
- If I sign **and** P1 doesn’t sign → I get 6
- If I don’t sign → I get 6 (regardless of P1)

So **by signing**, I give myself a chance to get 15 (if P1 signs), but **no risk of getting less** — worst case is 6, same as not signing.

So **signing is weakly better** — it offers an improvement possibility, and no downside.

But could there be a downside?

Is there any reason I might get **less** than 6 if I sign?

No: because if I sign and P1 doesn’t sign → contract inactive → base game → I still get 6.

Only if both sign → I get 15.

So **I never lose by signing**.

Moreover, **if P1 is rational**, would P1 want to sign?

Let’s check.

**Player 1’s interest:**

If P1 signs the contract:

- If both sign → P1 gets 15 in (A0, A0) or 15 in (A1, A0) → so at least 15
- If only P1 signs → contract inactive → base game → P1 gets 20 (if P2 plays A0) or 4 (if P2 plays A1)
  - But P2’s dominant strategy is A0 → so P1 gets 20

But if P1 signs, **but P2 does not** → contract inactive → P1 gets 20

If both sign → P1 gets 15 at best (in (A0, A0)) — less than 20

So P1 would prefer not to sign — because if P2 doesn’t sign, P1 gets 20, but if both sign, P1 gets max 15 → worse.

So **P1 has no incentive to sign** → P1 will **not** sign.

Therefore, **P1 will not sign the contract**.

So **contract will never be active**.

Therefore, even if I sign, **contract is not active**, because P1 won’t sign.

So I end up in **base game**, getting 6.

But if I **don’t sign**, same thing — base game → 6.

So **no difference**.

But is that fair?

Wait: I need to consider **what P1 thinks**.

Suppose I believe that P1 understands the game.

If I sign, P1 sees that I signed → but knows that **if I sign and he doesn’t, contract doesn’t activate** → P1 still gets 20 in base game.

But if P1 signs too, and I play A0, then P1 gets 15 → worse than 20.

So P1 **will not sign**, because he prefers 20 in base game over 15 in contract game.

So **P1 will not sign**.

Therefore, **contract will not activate**.

Thus, whether I sign or not, contract is inactive → base game → I get 6.

So **signing gains me nothing**.

But wait — could I **force** P1 to sign?

No — it's a simultaneous decision? Or sequential?

The problem says: "you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract"

And the contract is activated only if **all players sign**.

It doesn’t specify if decisions are simultaneous or not.

But since it’s a decision-making game, and we are to choose whether to sign, **we can assume we don't have commitment power**.

So if I sign, and P1 doesn’t, no contract.

So **signature by one player is not sufficient**.

Therefore, since P1 has no incentive to sign (he prefers 20 over 15), **he will not sign**.

Thus, **contract will not happen**.

Therefore, **I cannot get 15**, only 6.

But if I don’t sign, I also get 6.

So **signing gives me no advantage**, and **no risk** — so I might as well sign?

But is there a possibility that **if I sign, P1 might believe I will stick to A0**?

No — P1 knows that even if I sign, contract doesn’t activate unless he signs.

And if he doesn’t sign, base game: he gets 20.

So he gains nothing by signing.

Therefore, **P1 will not sign**.

So contract will not activate.

Thus, my payoff is 6 either way.

So **signing is useless?**

But perhaps… if I sign, and P1 thinks I might be more cooperative, would he cooperate?

But in this setup, **P1 has no incentive to sign**.

Even if he thinks I will play A0, he gets 20 anyway in base game.

By signing, he gets **less** (15 vs 20) if I play A0.

So **P1 will not sign**.

Thus, contract will not activate.

So **no benefit to me**.

But I have no downside.

So **signing is neutral**.

But the question is: **should I sign?**

If there is no downside and no benefit, should I still sign?

But in some settings, signing might signal something.

But here, **if signing does not change outcome**, then I may as well not sign to avoid risk, but there is **no risk**.

Alternatively, maybe I should **not sign** to avoid any potential miscoordination, but there is none.

But wait — let’s think again.

Suppose I sign.

P1 sees I signed.

P1 knows that if he **doesn’t sign**, contract is inactive → base game → he plays A1 (dominant) → I play A0 → payoffs (20, 0)

But wait — in base game, **P2 plays A0**, so P2 gets 6.

But if P1 doesn’t sign, he gets 20.

So P1 still gets 20.

No change.

But if P1 signs, and I signed, then both must play — but P1 knows he gets only 15, which is less than 20.

So P1 **will not sign**.

Thus, **outcome is unchanged**.

So **no incentive to sign**.

Therefore, **I should not sign**, because it offers no benefit, and might be seen as irrational if I sign when it gives me nothing.

But is there a possibility that **if I sign, P1 might sign too**, to coordinate?

But P1 has every reason to **not** sign.

Unless… what if P1 thinks I might deviate?

But this is a one-shot game.

No signaling advantage.

Moreover, P1 knows I will play A0 regardless.

So **signed contract doesn't change anything**.

Therefore, **signing is pointless**.

But the **contract is proposed by Player 1**, and it's a **payment contract**.

But P1 has no incentive to sign — because he can get 20 in base game, and only 15 in contract game.

So **P1 will not sign**.

Therefore, **the contract will not be active**.

So signing gives me **no utility**.

But is there any **cost of signing**?

No — the contract just says what happens if you play.

So **signing has no downside** — it’s free.

So even if it gives no benefit, **if it costs nothing, why not sign?**

But the question is: **should I sign?**

In game theory, if signing has **no cost and no benefit**, but **no harm**, then **it’s rational to sign** — because it doesn't worsen your outcome, and might improve it.

But in this case, it **cannot improve** it — because P1 won’t sign.

But I **don’t know** that for sure — but I can **reason** that P1 has no incentive to sign.

So I know that **if I sign, contract still won’t activate**.

So signing gives me zero benefit and zero cost.

So **I am indifferent**.

But the question is to choose **yes or no**.

In such cases, we usually assume that **if there is no negative consequence, and no positive consequence, but no downside, it’s fine to sign**.

But let’s think differently.

Suppose I **do not sign**.

Then P1 might think: “If I don’t sign, I get 20 in base game. Good.”

So P1 doesn’t sign.

Same as if I sign.

But if I **sign**, and P1 sees that, he might think: “Wait, if I sign too, I get 15, but if I don’t, I get 20 — so I won’t sign.”

So no change.

Therefore, **no benefit to signing** — and **no cost**.

But let’s consider the **expected value**.

Suppose I sign.

Then, with **probability 0** (since P1 won't sign), I get 15.

With **probability 1**, contract not active → I get 6.

→ Expected payoff: 6

If I don't sign → also 6

So **same expected payoff**

Therefore, **I am indifferent**

But the game asks for a **binary decision**.

Can I choose arbitrarily?

But we must **justify**.

Now, notice: **if I sign, and P1 also signs, I get 15**.

But P1 sees that **if he signs, he gets at most 15, but if he doesn’t, he gets 20** → so he will not sign.

Therefore, **there is zero probability that both sign**.

So **I get 6 for sure**.

But **if I don’t sign**, also 6.

So same.

But in decision theory, if there’s no downside and no upside, and you don’t have preferences, you can choose either.

But in practice, sometimes you might sign to signal cooperation, but here it's not necessary.

But wait — **what if I sign, and P1 observes that I signed, and thinks I will play A0 with high probability, so he might be induced to sign**?

But no — P1 knows that even if I sign, if he doesn’t, contract doesn’t activate, and he gets 20.

So **he has no reason to change his decision**.

Therefore, **signing does nothing**.

But is there a **strictly better choice**?

No.

So both actions give the same outcome.

But now, let’s go back to the **original motivation for the contract**.

Player 1 proposed the contract.

Why did he propose it?

In base game, P1 gets 20, P2 gets 6.

P1 loses 14 in base game — he might want to redistribute.

But with the contract:

- If both play A0: P1 gets 15 (base 10 + 5 from contract) vs 20 → worse
- If (A1, A0): P1 gets 15 → worse than 20
- Only if they play (A0, A0), P1 gets 15, but he could have 20 in base game.

So P1 is **worse off** with contract.

Therefore, **P1 has no incentive to propose a contract that harms him**.

But the contract is proposed — so maybe it’s a **trick**.

But the premise says: "a contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1)"

So it was proposed, and approved.

But if P1 proposed it, but it harms him, why would he?

Unless he **misunderstands**.

But the problem says it was selected via approval voting — meaning both players must have approved?

No — "approval voting" likely means that the contract was proposed and then voted on — but only one player needed to propose?

The phrasing: "the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1)"

This suggests that the contract was **approved** — i.e., **both players** approved.

But if both approved, then **both signed**.

But earlier we said P1 has no incentive to sign.

But if both signed, then contract is active.

So maybe **both players did sign**, and the contract is active.

But the question is: "you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract"

This implies that the decision is **not yet made**.

But the contract was "selected via approval voting" — which suggests it was chosen.

But there is a contradiction.

Let’s reread:

> "Here is the twist: On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1)"

Ah — "selected via approval voting" — this likely means that the contract **was approved**, so it is **in effect**.

But then you are asked to decide whether to sign.

This is confusing.

Perhaps "selected via approval voting" means that the contract was chosen by the voting process, and now you are to decide whether to sign it.

But if it was selected, it means it’s agreed.

Alternatively, perhaps "approval voting" means that players voted to accept it, and you are about to decide.

But the sentence says "that was selected" — past tense.

But then you are asked to decide.

This is ambiguous.

But the way it's phrased: "you are asked to decide whether to sign" — implies that you are on the fence.

But if the contract was already selected, then it should be active.

But then there would be no need to decide.

Unless "approved" means it was proposed, and now you must choose.

But the word "selected" suggests it is already chosen.

Perhaps it means that **the contract is the one that passed approval voting**, so it is the one on the table, and you must decide whether to sign it.

That makes sense.

So the contract is **on the table**, and both players must sign for it to be active.

You are one player.

Player 1 proposed it, and it passed approval voting — but that might mean **at least one player approved**, or both.

But the phrasing: "selected via approval voting" — likely means it was chosen as the contract.

So now, you are to decide whether to sign.

But to be active, both must sign.

So you must decide.

Now, if you sign, and P1 also signed, it activates.

But P1 may not want to sign.

But you can assume that P1 **did sign**, because the contract was selected via approval voting.

"Approval voting" typically means a process where each player votes yes or no.

If it was selected, then **both players must have approved**.

Therefore, the contract **will be active**.

Otherwise, it wouldn't have been selected.

So **both players have signed** → contract is active.

But then you have no choice — it's active.

But the question says: "you are asked to decide whether to sign"

This implies that you are the one to decide.

Perhaps "selected via approval voting" means that the contract was chosen as the possible contract, and now you decide whether to sign it.

But if it was selected, then it's available.

Given the ambiguity, the best interpretation is:

- The contract has been **proposed and is on the table**
- You are to decide whether to sign
- The contract becomes active only if **all players sign**
- So your decision matters

And since the contract was "selected via approval voting", it implies that it is the one being considered.

Given that, and that P1 proposed it, but we don't know if he signed.

But to resolve this, let's assume that **Player 1 has already signed or will**.

But the only way the contract becomes active is if both sign.

So if I sign, and P1 signs, then yes.

But P1 may not.

But earlier, we saw that P1 has no incentive to sign, because he prefers 20 to 15.

So he will not sign.

Therefore, the contract will only be active if I sign and P1 signs, but P1 won't.

So inactive.

So my payoff is 6.

But if I don't sign, same.

So no difference.

But why then would the contract be selected?

Perhaps the contract was selected by players, meaning it was approved, so both signed.

But then why ask to decide?

The only logical resolution is that the "approval voting" is not yet complete.

Perhaps it means that the contract was approved by a vote, but you are to decide.

But to break the deadlock, let's go back.

If you sign, and P1 signs, you get 15.

If not, you get 6.

P1 will only sign if he benefits.

But he gets 15 if both sign, but 20 if not.

So he will not sign.

Therefore, contract will not activate.

Therefore, signing gives you no benefit.

But there is no cost.

So should you sign?

In game theory, if signing has no cost and no benefit, and you have no regret, you might as well not sign, to avoid the appearance of irrationality.

But here, there's no harm.

However, let's calculate: if I sign, my expected payoff is 6 (because contract won't activate).

If I don't sign, also 6.

So indifferent.

But the question asks for a yes/no.

We must choose.

In such cases, if there is no downside, and you want to maximize expected value, and you are risk-neutral, you can choose either.

But to be safe, and since the contract might be proposed by P1 for a reason, but we see that it is not beneficial for P1, so unlikely to be signed.

But the contract is in place.

After careful consideration, the only thing that matters is: **if I sign, under the assumption that P1 will not sign, I get 6, same as not signing**.

Therefore, ** signing does nothing for me**.

Moreover, since P1 has a dominant strategy to not sign, you should not expect the contract to activate.

Therefore, you should not expect to gain anything.

But since there is no cost, and no benefit, and no risk, the rational choice might be to **not sign** to avoid any potential misunderstanding, or to sign.

But to maximize, the expected utility is the same.

However, in many decision problems, when one option has no downside and no upside, and the other has no downside and no upside, you can choose either.

But to pick one, let's think about your objective: **maximize your total points**.

With contract active: you get 15
Without: 6

So you want it to be active.

But you can't force it.

So if you sign, and P1 signs, you get 15.

But P1 won't sign.

So you can't get 15.

Therefore, you will get 6.

So signing gives you no advantage.

So you should ** not sign** if you believe P1 will not sign.

And you do believe that.

So final answer: **do not sign**

But let's consider: what if you sign, and P1 sees that you signed, and decides to sign too, to avoid the worst?

But P1 can get 20 in base game, so no.

I think the only logical choice is to not sign, because you can't improve your outcome, and there's no reason to do so.

But let's do a final comparison.

- If you sign: 
  - If P1 signs: you get 15 ( but P1 won't, so not happen)
  - If P1 doesn't: you get 6
  - Expected: 6

- If you don't sign: you get 6

So same.

But if you sign, you are not worse off.

But you are not better off.

So to be cautious, you might not sign.

However, in the absence of any cost, you might as well sign.

But in this case, since the contract is proposed by P1, and it's not in his interest, it's likely that you are in a situation where the contract might not be active, but you can still sign.

Given that, and since there's no benefit, and you might want to avoid giving P1 a chance to exploit you, but there's no exploitation.

I think the safe answer is to not sign.

But let's box it.

After deep analysis, the contract is not beneficial to you, and you cannot get the benefit because P1 has no incentive to sign.

Therefore, signing doesn't improve your outcome.

So you should not sign.

But is there a way that signing could help?

No.

So final decision: do not sign.

But let's double-check the contract.

In the contract, if you choose A0, you get +5, paid by P1.

In base game, when you play A0, you get 10.

With contract, you get 15 if P1 also plays A0.

But if P1 doesn't, you get 6.

So no.

I think the only conclusion is that since the contract won't activate, signing is pointless.

But to be safe, since it costs nothing, and might be a signal, but P1 won't change.

So I think the answer is to ** not sign**.

But wait — let's think from the beginning.

Perhaps the "approval voting" means that the contract was approved, so it is active.

In that case, the contract is already in effect.

Then why ask to decide?

It must be that you are to decide whether to sign, and the contract is not yet active.

Given that, and P1 won't sign, you should not sign.

Final decision: do not sign.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Let me work through this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the original game without the contract

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:

```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Player 2  A0  (10,10)  (2,6)
          A1  (20,0)   (4,4)
```

**Analyzing the equilibrium without contract:**
- If Player 1 plays A0, I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If Player 1 plays A1, I prefer A1 (4 > 2)
- So A1 is my dominant strategy

For Player 1:
- If I play A0, Player 1 prefers A0 (10 > 6)
- If I play A1, Player 1 prefers A1 (4 > 0)

Since I have a dominant strategy (A1), Player 1 will rationally choose A1, resulting in equilibrium **(A1, A1)** where **I get 4 points**.

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 10 points to the other player
- If a player chooses A0, no payment

New payoff matrix with contract:

```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Player 2  A0  (10,10)  (12,-4)
          A1  (10,10)  (4,4)
```

Calculations:
- (A0,A0): (10,10) - no change
- (A1,A0): (20-10, 0+10) = (10,10)
- (A0,A1): (2+10, 6-10) = (12,-4)
- (A1,A1): (4,4) - payments cancel

## Step 3: Find equilibrium with contract

For me (Player 2), given Player 1 plays A0 with probability p:
- Payoff from A0: 10p + 12(1-p) = 12 - 2p
- Payoff from A1: 10p + 4(1-p) = 4 + 6p
- A0 is better when 12 - 2p > 4 + 6p → p < 1 (almost always)

For Player 1, given I play A0 with probability q:
- Payoff from A0: 10 (constant)
- Payoff from A1: -4q + 4(1-q) = 4 - 8q
- A0 is better when 10 > 4 - 8q (always true for q ≥ 0)

**Both players prefer A0!** The equilibrium is **(A0, A0)** where **I get 10 points**.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** I get 4 points
- **With contract:** I get 10 points

The contract increases my expected payoff from 4 to 10 points - a significant improvement!

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

Under C1, if a player chooses A0, they get +10 from the other player.

Modified payoffs for me under C1:
- (A0, A0): 10 (base) + 10 (my A0 bonus) - 10 (their A0 bonus) = **10**
- (A0, A1): 0 (base) + 10 (my A0 bonus) - 0 = **10**
- (A1, A0): 6 (base) + 0 - 10 (their A0 bonus) = **-4**
- (A1, A1): 4 (base) + 0 - 0 = **4**

For me under C1, A0 strictly dominates A1 (gives 10 vs -4 or 4).

Modified payoffs for Player 2 under C1:
- (A0, A0): 10 (base) + 10 (their A0) - 10 (my A0) = **10**
- (A0, A1): 20 (base) + 0 - 10 (my A0) = **10**
- (A1, A0): 2 (base) + 10 (their A0) - 0 = **12**
- (A1, A1): 4 (base) + 0 - 0 = **4**

Given I play A0 (dominant strategy), Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give 10).

**Expected outcome under C1: I get 10 points, they get 10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

C2 has no additional payments - just the original game.

In the original game:
- Player 2 has a dominant strategy: A1 (gives 20 vs 10 when I play A0; gives 4 vs 2 when I play A1)
- Given Player 2 plays A1, my best response is A1 (4 > 0)

**Expected outcome under C2: I get 4 points, they get 4 points**

## Step 4: Strategic approval decision

Under C1: I get 10 points (better for me!)
Under C2: I get 4 points

Should I approve both? 
- If both contracts get 2 approvals, there's a 50% chance each is selected
- Expected payoff: 0.5(10) + 0.5(4) = 7

Should I approve only C1?
- Player 2 will definitely approve C1 (gives them 10 vs 4)
- If I approve only C1, it's guaranteed to have at least as many approvals as C2
- This maximizes my chance of getting C1 (my preferred outcome)
- Expected payoff: 10

By approving only C1, I ensure the best outcome for myself.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

Original payoff matrix (my payoffs):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

Let me find the Nash equilibrium:
- At (A0, A0): Other player would want to deviate to A1 (getting 20 instead of 10). Not equilibrium.
- At (A0, A1): I would want to deviate to A1 (getting 4 instead of 0). Not equilibrium.
- At (A1, A0): I would want to deviate to A0 (getting 10 instead of 6). Not equilibrium.
- At (A1, A1): If I deviate to A0, I get 0 < 4. If other deviates to A0, they get 2 < 4. Neither wants to deviate. **This is the Nash equilibrium.**

Without contract: I expect to get **4 points**.

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

With the contract, payments modify the payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 10 + 0 = **10** (no one pays)
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 10 = **10** (other pays 10 to me)
- (A1, A0): I get 6 - 10 = **-4** (I pay 10 to other)
- (A1, A1): I get 4 - 10 + 10 = **4** (we both pay 10 to each other)

## Step 3: Determine my optimal strategy with contract

Comparing my payoffs:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 10, A1 gives me -4 → **I prefer A0**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 10, A1 gives me 4 → **I prefer A0**

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy** with the contract! I will always play A0.

With contract: I expect to get **10 points**.

## Step 4: Make the decision

- Without contract: 4 points
- With contract: 10 points

Since 10 > 4, signing the contract is clearly beneficial for me.

The contract effectively penalizes playing A1, which pushes both players toward the cooperative (A0, A0) outcome instead of the non-cooperative (A1, A1) equilibrium.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we need to analyze the given payoff matrix and think about how our probabilities will interact with those of Player 2. Let's break this down into clear steps to form our reasoning:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Payoff Matrix:**
   The payoffs for each combination of actions by Player 1 and Player 2 are as follows:

   |        | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
   |--------|---------------|---------------|
   | **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)       | (0, 20)        |
   | **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)        | (4, 4)         |

   Here, the first number in each pair is Player 1's payoff, and the second is Player 2's payoff.

2. **Calculate Expected Payoffs:**
   Since the actions are determined probabilistically, we denote Player 1's probabilities for A0 and A1 as \( P(A0_1) \) and \( P(A1_1) \), and similarly, Player 2's probabilities as \( P(A0_2) \) and \( P(A1_2) \).

   Let:
   - \( P(A0_1) = x \)
   - \( P(A1_1) = 1 - x \)
   - \( P(A0_2) = y \)
   - \( P(A1_2) = 1 - y \)

   The expected payoff for Player 1 can be calculated as:
   \[
   E(U_1) = x \cdot y \cdot 10 + x \cdot (1 - y) \cdot 0 + (1 - x) \cdot y \cdot 6 + (1 - x) \cdot (1 - y) \cdot 4
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   E(U_1) = 10xy + 0 + 6(1 - x)y + 4(1 - x)(1 - y)
   \]
   \[
   E(U_1) = 10xy + 6y - 6xy + 4 - 4x - 4y + 4xy
   \]
   \[
   E(U_1) = 4 + 2xy + 2y - 4x
   \]

3. **Expected Payoff Considering Player 2's Strategy:**
   We need to consider Player 2's potential strategies. If we assume Player 2 is rational and also aims to maximize their payoff, we analyze their payoffs similarly. Ideally, we can anticipate Player 2's probabilities to maximize our payoff. 

   Player 2's best response usually gets inferred from the payoff table.

4. **Reaction to Rejected Contract:**
   The contract would have incentivized the players to choose A0. Since Player 2 rejected the contract, they might be favoring a strategy different from A0. 

   We assume Player 2 might lean towards a balanced but risk-averse strategy, likely distributing their probabilities more on A1 if they view A0 (which was encouraged by the contract) unfavorably.

5. **Best Strategy for Player 1:**
   Given our own maximization strategy without the contract, we look at maximizing through a mix: 
   - A0 provides high payoff if Player 2 does A0, and zero if Player 2 does A1.
   - A1 gives moderate payoffs consistently.

Based on mixed strategies' analysis – aiming for balance and overall point maximization:

Let's choose a balanced but weighted strategy favoring consistent points.

### Final Decision:

Therefore, a practical mixed strategy could be a bit more on A1:
   - \( P(A0_1) = 40\text{ points} \)
   - \( P(A1_1) = 60\text{ points} \)

Returning the JSON Object:

```json
{
  "A0": 40,
  "A1": 60
}
```

This distribution ensures a balanced and rational distribution optimizing consistent return in anticipation of Player 2’s rational play despite the rejected contract.

response:
1) Compute equilibrium outcomes under each contract (assuming both players then play a Nash equilibrium of the modified game).

**No contract (baseline, for reference):**
- For Player 2 (me), **A1 strictly dominates A0** (20>10 if P1 plays A0; 4>2 if P1 plays A1).
- So equilibrium is (P2=A1, P1=A1) giving me **4**.

---

2) **Contract C1 (A0-earns +15 taken from the other player)**

Transfers:
- If one player plays **A0** and the other plays **A1**, the A0-player gets +15 and the A1-player pays 15.
- If both play A0, transfers cancel (each pays and receives 15).

Player 2 payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 10 (net transfer 0)
- (A1,A0): 20 − 15 = 5
- (A0,A1): 2 + 15 = 17
- (A1,A1): 4

So for me, **A0 strictly dominates A1** under C1. Player 1 similarly ends up preferring A0 always.  
Equilibrium: (A0,A0) → my payoff **10**.

---

3) **Contract C2 (A1 pays 5 to the other player)**

Player 2 payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A1,A0): 20 − 5 = 15
- (A0,A1): 2 + 5 = 7
- (A1,A1): 4 (both pay 5 and receive 5, net 0)

Player 1’s best response becomes **always A0** (it beats A1 whether I play A0 or A1).  
Given P1 plays A0, my best response is A1 (15 > 10).  
Equilibrium: (P2=A1, P1=A0) → my payoff **15**.

---

4) Voting incentives
- Player 1 prefers **C1** (they get 10 under C1 vs 5 under C2), so they will likely approve C1 and reject C2.
- If I approve **only C2**, approvals likely become: C1=1, C2=1 → tie → winner picked uniformly at random → my expected payoff = (10 + 15)/2 = **12.5**.
- If I approve C1 (or both), C1 likely wins for sure → my payoff **10**.

So I should **approve only C2**.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the game and your role

You are **Player 2** in a symmetric two-player simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (with your payoffs in the bottom-left, the other player’s in the top-right):

|                | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **You (Player 2): A0** | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)       |
| **You (Player 2): A1** | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

So, your payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

---

### Step 2: Analyze for Nash equilibrium (best response reasoning)

Since you are playing against another rational player, and both of you are choosing probabilities simultaneously, we want to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that Player 1 chooses A0
- $ q $ = probability that YOU (Player 2) choose A0

Then:
- $ 1-p $ = probability Player 1 chooses A1
- $ 1-q $ = probability YOU choose A1

---

#### Expected payoff for you (Player 2), given Player 1 chooses A0 with prob $ p $ and A1 with $ 1-p $:

Your expected payoff when you choose **A0**:
$$
EU_2(A0) = p \cdot 10 + (1-p) \cdot 2 = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2
$$

Your expected payoff when you choose **A1**:
$$
EU_2(A1) = p \cdot 20 + (1-p) \cdot 4 = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4
$$

You are indifferent when:
$$
8p + 2 = 16p + 4
\Rightarrow -8p = 2
\Rightarrow p = -0.25
$$

But this is **impossible** (probability can't be negative), so no mixed strategy equilibrium exists where Player 1 is mixing?

Wait — this suggests that **payoff for A1 is always better than A0** for Player 2, regardless of $ p $? Let's check:

Compare $ EU_2(A1) - EU_2(A0) = (16p + 4) - (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 $

Since $ p \geq 0 $, $ 8p + 2 \geq 2 > 0 $, so **A1 always gives strictly higher expected payoff than A0**, no matter what Player 1 does.

> **Therefore, for you (Player 2), A1 is a strictly dominant strategy.**

You should **always choose A1**.

But wait — let's test this with actual values.

- If Player 1 plays A0 (p=1):  
  - A0 gives 10, A1 gives 20 → A1 better  
- If Player 1 plays A1 (p=0):  
  - A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4 → A1 better  

So yes, A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2.

---

### Step 3: What about the other player?

Let’s now check if the other player (Player 1) has a dominant strategy.

Player 1's payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A1, A1): 4

Let $ q $ = probability Player 2 chooses A0

Player 1's expected payoff:
- A0: $ q \cdot 10 + (1-q) \cdot 6 = 10q + 6 - 6q = 4q + 6 $
- A1: $ q \cdot 0 + (1-q) \cdot 4 = 4 - 4q $

Compare:
- A0 vs A1: $ 4q + 6 $ vs $ 4 - 4q $
- Set equal: $ 4q + 6 = 4 - 4q \Rightarrow 8q = -2 \Rightarrow q = -0.25 $

Again, impossible. So $ 4q + 6 > 4 - 4q $ for all $ q \in [0,1] $

Thus, A0 strictly dominates A1 for Player 1.

So **Player 1 will always choose A0**.

---

### Step 4: Nash equilibrium

Given:
- Player 1 will play A0 (dominant strategy)
- You, Player 2, will play A1 (dominant strategy)

Therefore, the unique Nash equilibrium is:
- Player 1: A0 with probability 1
- Player 2: A1 with probability 1

This leads to outcome: (A1, A0) → you get **20 points**, other player gets 0.

---

### Step 5: Consider the contract (but it’s rejected!)

The contract was proposed by Player 1, but **you (Player 2) rejected it**, so it is **inactive**.

The contract says:
- If you choose A0 → +5 points (from the other player)
- If you choose A1 → -5 points (to the other player)

But since you **rejected it**, it does **not** affect the game. So you ignore it.

So, no contract → you play the **original game**, and both players are rational.

---

### Step 6: Final decision

Since A1 is **strictly dominant** for you (Player 2), you should **always choose A1** to maximize your expected payoff.

Thus, your optimal strategy is:
- A0: 0%
- A1: 100%

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

response:
Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game and Payoffs**

We are playing a game where both players simultaneously choose actions A0 or A1. The payoffs are as follows (as Player 2):

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 10          | 10                     |
| A1          | A0                     | 20          | 0                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 2           | 6                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 4           | 4                      |

So as Player 2, we care about maximizing our own expected points.

---

### **Step 2: Identify Nash Equilibrium (Without Contracts)**

Let’s find the best responses to understand how players would act if no contract is in place.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that Player 1 chooses A0 (we’re Player 2)
- $ q $ = probability that Player 2 chooses A0 (our choice)

But since we are *Player 2*, and we are deciding strategies and contracts, we need to think from our perspective.

We want to choose a mixing probability $ q $ to maximize our **expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 chooses a strategy $ p $.

Let’s compute expected payoff for Player 2 (us) given our choice and the opponent’s strategy.

#### Expected payoff if we choose A0:
- With prob $ p $, opponent chooses A0 → we get 10
- With prob $ 1-p $, opponent chooses A1 → we get 2  
→ $ E[A0] = 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2 $

#### Expected payoff if we choose A1:
- With prob $ p $, opponent chooses A0 → we get 20
- With prob $ 1-p $, opponent chooses A1 → we get 4  
→ $ E[A1] = 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4 $

We will choose A1 if $ 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 $ → $ 8p > -2 $ → always true (since $ p \geq 0 $)  
So $ E[A1] > E[A0] $ for all $ p $?

Wait: Let’s solve:
$ 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 $
→ $ 8p > -2 $
→ Always true since $ p \geq 0 $. So A1 is always better?

Wait — but that can’t be right. Let’s plug in $ p = 0 $ (opponent always chooses A1):

- A0: 2 points
- A1: 4 points → still better

At $ p = 1 $ (opponent always A0):
- A0: 10
- A1: 20 → still better

So regardless of what Player 1 does, **A1 dominates A0** for us as Player 2.

Therefore, if no contract is in place, **Player 2 will always choose A1**.

Now what about Player 1?

Player 1’s payoffs:
- A0: 10 if opponent A0, 2 if opponent A1 → $ E = 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2 $
- A1: 0 if opponent A0, 4 if opponent A1 → $ E = 0p + 4(1-p) = 4(1-p) $

So compare:
- A0: $ 8p + 2 $
- A1: $ 4(1-p) = 4 - 4p $

Set equal: $ 8p + 2 = 4 - 4p $ → $ 12p = 2 $ → $ p = 1/6 $

- If $ p < 1/6 $, A1 is better
- If $ p > 1/6 $, A0 is better

So Player 1’s best response:
- If $ p < 1/6 $ → play A1
- If $ p > 1/6 $ → play A0
- If $ p = 1/6 $, indifferent

But we just established that Player 2 **always** plays A1 (since A1 dominates A0 for us).

So $ p = 0 $ (Player 1 plays A0 with 0 probability).

Thus, Player 1 faces:
- A0: $ 8(0) + 2 = 2 $
- A1: $ 4(1 - 0) = 4 $

So Player 1 earns 4 with A1, 2 with A0 → Player 1 will choose A1.

Therefore, **without any contract**, both players will choose A1, and the outcome is:

- Player 2 (us): 4 points
- Player 1: 4 points

But is this the only equilibrium?

Wait — let’s double-check if there’s a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium?

Suppose Player 2 **always** plays A1 (as we concluded, since A1 dominates A0). Then Player 1’s best response is A1.

So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

Now check: what if Player 1 were to play A0? Then we (Player 2) get 10 if we play A0, 20 if A1 → still prefer A1.

So yes, in the absence of any contract, (A1, A1) is the rational outcome.

But let’s consider if **a contract** could change things.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contracts**

There are two proposed contracts.

#### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1):**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 10 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:
- Choosing A0 → +10 to self, -5 from opponent
- Choosing A1 → no change

Note: This is a **transfer** mechanism.

But wait: the contract says “drawn equally from the other players” → so the 10 points for choosing A0 are **taken from the other player**, split equally? But only one other player.

So “drawn equally from the other players” → since only one other player, that person loses 10 points.

Therefore:
- If you play A0 → you gain +10, opponent loses -10.
- If you play A1 → no change to either.

So this is like a **subsidy to A0 choices**.

#### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2):**
- No payments for A0 or A1.
→ So it’s **no change** to payoffs.

So C2 is a **null contract**.

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate Each Contract from Our Perspective (Player 2)**

We want to **maximize** our **expected total points**.

We can approve contracts. The winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So we need to decide: **Which contracts will increase our expected payoff?**

Also note: the contract is only effective if **both players agree**. But the process says: “a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process.” And “winning contract” is selected from those with max approvals.

So if we approve C1 and not C2, and Player 1 approves both, then:
- C1: 2 approvals (both approve)
- C2: 1 approval (only Player 1)

So C1 wins.

If we approve C2 but not C1, then:
- C1: 1 approval (only Player 1)
- C2: 2 approvals (both)

C2 wins.

If we approve neither, only C1 has 1 approval → C1 wins.

But we care about **which contract ends up being applied**, because that determines our payoff.

So **we must predict (or choose strategically)** which contract will actually be selected, based on our approval.

Since the winner is the one with **maximum approvals**, and if tie then chosen uniformly, we need to choose approvals so that our expected payoff is maximized **under the actual contract that gets implemented**.

So we need to **strategically approve contracts** to **maximize the probability** that a contract favorable to us is selected.

Let’s analyze.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**

In C1:
- If you choose A0 → you get 10 extra → total payoff increases by 10
- But opponent loses 10 → so opponent’s payoff is reduced by 10

So updated payoffs become:

From **Player 2's perspective** (our payoff is adjusted):

| Your A | Opponent A | Your base payoff | Adjustment (C1) | Your Net Payoff | Opponent's Payoff |
|--------|------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| A0     | A0         | 10               | +10              | 20               | 10 -10 = 0        |
| A1     | A0         | 20               | 0                | 20               | 0 -10 = -10       |
| A0     | A1         | 2                | +10              | 12               | 6 -10 = -4        |
| A1     | A1         | 4                | 0                | 4                | 4 -10 = -6        |

Wait — actually, the **+10** is applied **when you choose A0**, regardless of opponent’s choice.

So if **you** (Player 2) pick A0 → you get +10

If **opponent** picks A0 → opponent gets +10, and you get -10

So we need to recompute payoffs with C1 applied.

Let’s write the **full payoff matrix under C1**:

| Your A | Opponent A | Your Payoff | Opponent Payoff |
|--------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| A0     | A0         | 10 +10 = 20 | 10 -10 = 0      |
| A1     | A0         | 20 + 0 = 20 | 0 -10 = -10     |
| A0     | A1         | 2 +10 = 12  | 6 -10 = -4      |
| A1     | A1         | 4 + 0 = 4   | 4 -10 = -6      |

But note: **only the player who chooses A0 gets +10**, and **the other player loses 10**.

So yes, this is correct.

Now, our game (Player 2) under C1:

We care about **our own payoff**.

Let’s compute our best responses under C1.

Let $ p $ = probability opponent chooses A0.

Our payoff if we play A0:  
- $ p \cdot 20 + (1-p) \cdot 12 = 20p + 12(1-p) = 8p + 12 $

Our payoff if we play A1:  
- $ p \cdot 20 + (1-p) \cdot 4 = 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4 $

Now compare:

Set $ 8p + 12 = 16p + 4 $  
→ $ 12 - 4 = 16p - 8p $ → $ 8 = 8p $ → $ p = 1 $

So:
- If $ p < 1 $, then $ 16p + 4 > 8p + 12 $? 
Wait — let’s plug in $ p = 0 $ (opponent always A1):

- A0: 8(0) + 12 = 12
- A1: 16(0) + 4 = 4 → so A0 better

At $ p = 1 $:
- A0: 8 + 12 = 20
- A1: 16 + 4 = 20 → equal

At $ p = 0.5 $:
- A0: 8(0.5) + 12 = 4 + 12 = 16
- A1: 16(0.5) + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 → A0 better

So A0 is better than A1 for us **always except when p = 1**, where equal.

Wait, let's check the difference:  
$ (8p + 12) - (16p + 4) = -8p + 8 $

So:
- If $ -8p + 8 > 0 $ → $ p < 1 $ → A0 better
- If $ p = 1 $ → equal

So for **all p < 1**, A0 is strictly better.

So **we will always choose A0 unless opponent plays A0 with probability 1**.

But now we need to see what **opponent** (Player 1) will do under C1.

Player 1’s payoffs under C1:

| Opponent A | Your A | Opponent Payoff (Player 1) |
|------------|--------|----------------------------|
| A0         | A0     | 10 -10 = 0 (because Player 2 chose A0) |
| A0         | A1     | 0 -10 = -10 (because Player 2 chose A1) |
| A1         | A0     | 6 -10 = -4 (because Player 2 chose A0) |
| A1         | A1     | 4 -10 = -6 (because Player 2 chose A1) |

Wait — no: **only the player who chooses A0 gets +10**, and the other loses 10.

So if **Player 1 chooses A0**, then:
- Player 1 gets +10
- Player 2 gets -10 (if Player 2 chose A0), or 0 if Player 2 chose A1? Wait no:

Wait — let’s rephrase:

> “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players.”

So if **you** choose A0 → you get +10, **opponent** loses 10.

So:

- If **Player 1** chooses A0 → Player 1 gets +10, Player 2 gets -10 (regardless of what Player 2 chooses? No — only if Player 2 is the other player.)

Yes: the **other player loses 10**.

So in all cases, if you choose A0, opponent loses 10.

So Player 1’s payoffs under C1:

| Player 1 A | Player 2 A | Base | Adjustment (C1) | New |
|------------|------------|------|------------------|-----|
| A0         | A0         | 10   | +10              | 20  |
| A0         | A1         | 0    | +10              | 10  |
| A1         | A0         | 2    | -10              | -8  |
| A1         | A1         | 4    | -10              | -6  |

So Player 1’s payoffs:

- If Player 1 chooses A0: 20 with prob q (you choose A0), 10 with prob 1-q (you choose A1) → $ 20q + 10(1-q) = 10q + 10 $
- If Player 1 chooses A1: -8 with prob q, -6 with prob 1-q → $ -8q -6(1-q) = -8q -6 + 6q = -2q -6 $

Now compare:
- A0: $ 10q + 10 $
- A1: $ -2q -6 $

Set equal: $ 10q + 10 = -2q -6 $ → $ 12q = -16 $ → $ q = -16/12 $ → negative → so A0 is always better for Player 1?

Wait: even at $ q = 0 $ (we always A1):

- A0: $ 10(0) + 10 = 10 $
- A1: $ -2(0) -6 = -6 $ → A0 better

At $ q = 1 $: 
- A0: 20
- A1: -8 → still better

So **Player 1 will always choose A0** under C1.

Now, we (Player 2) know that Player 1 will play A0.

So we are facing:
- Opponent plays A0 with p = 1

Our payoffs:
- A0: 20 (from table above)
- A1: 20

Equal? Both give 20.

From earlier:
- A0 payoff: $ 8p + 12 $ = $ 8(1) + 12 = 20 $
- A1 payoff: $ 16p + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20 $

So we are **indifferent** between A0 and A1.

So we can play either.

But since both give 20, we’re fine.

So **under C1**, outcome is:
- Player 1 plays A0
- We (Player 2) can play A0 or A1 → either gives us 20
→ So **we will get 20 points** under C1.

**Great.**

---

### **Step 6: Evaluate Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**

C2: no additional payments.

So **payoffs unchanged** → same as original game.

We already established: without contract, **both players play A1** → we get **4 points**.

So if C2 is selected, we get **4 points**.

---

### **Step 7: Determine Strategic Approval**

Now we decide whether to approve C1 and/or C2.

We want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

Let’s consider possible scenarios based on what we approve.

We will **only know the outcome** when the contract is applied — so we want the **contract that gives us the highest payoff**, and **is likely to be selected**.

But selection depends on approvals.

Now note: **Player 1 is proposing C1**, so **they will definitely approve C1**.

They may or may not approve C2 (but since C2 is neutral, maybe they do).

But we don’t know Player 1's preferences — we only know that they proposed C1.

But since we are to decide **our** approvals, and we want to **maximize expected payoff**, we must infer.

Let’s suppose **Player 1 will approve C1 (since it's theirs)**, and may or may not approve C2.

But C2 is **blank** — no cost, no benefit. So **probably Player 1 will approve C2**, because it's costless.

So likely: Player 1 approves both C1 and C2.

Now, **our choices** determine the outcome.

Let’s consider:

#### Option 1: We approve C1 only

Then:
- C1: approved by Player 1 and us → 2 approvals
- C2: approved by Player 1 only → 1 approval

So C1 has max approvals → wins.

We get **20 points**.

#### Option 2: We approve C2 only

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (Player 1 only)
- C2: 2 approvals (both)

→ C2 wins → we get **4 points**

#### Option 3: We approve both

Then:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 2 approvals → both have max → winner chosen uniformly at random

So 50% chance C1 wins → 20 points
50% chance C2 wins → 4 points

**Expected payoff**: $ 0.5 \times 20 + 0.5 \times 4 = 10 + 2 = 12 $

#### Option 4: We approve neither

Then:
- C1: 1 approval → wins
- C2: 0

So C1 wins → we get 20 points

Wait — if we approve neither, then C1 has 1 approval (Player 1), C2 has 0 → C1 wins.

So we get 20.

---

### **Step 8: Compare Outcomes**

| Our Approval | Winning Contract | Our Payoff |
|--------------|------------------|------------|
| C1 only      | C1               | 20         |
| C2 only      | C2               | 4          |
| Both         | C1 or C2 (50%)   | 12         |
| Neither      | C1               | 20         |

So **best outcomes**: 20 points

We get 20 points in **C1 only**, **neither approved**, and **both approved (but only 50% chance)**.

But **both approved gives risk**: expected 12 < 20

So **better to approve C1 only or neither**

But which is better?

In **C1 only** and **neither**: we get 20 in both cases → same payoff.

But is there a difference?

In **neither approved**: we don’t approve C1, but C1 still wins because it has 1 approval.

But is that correct?

Yes: “winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.”

So if we don’t approve C1, then only Player 1 approves it → 1 approval.

C2: 0 → so C1 has max (1), so C1 wins.

So we get 20.

If we **approve C1**, same result: 2 approvals → still wins.

So **same outcome**.

But in **both approved**, we risk getting C2 (only 4 points).

So **we should not approve both**.

Now: should we **approve C1** or **not**?

Either way, C1 wins → we get 20.

So **same outcome**.

But **is there any reason to approve or not approve C1?**

Wait — if we **approve C1**, and maybe Player 1 also approves it, C1 has 2 approvals.

But if we **don’t**, still C1 has 1 → wins.

So outcome is same.

But what if **Player 1 does not approve C2**?

Earlier I assumed Player 1 would approve C2, since it’s neutral.

But let’s reconsider: **C2 costs nothing**, so **no downside**.

So unless Player 1 is hostile, they will approve C2.

But to be safe, suppose Player 1 **does approve C2**.

Then:

- If we approve C1 only → C1 has 2, C2 has 1 → C1 wins → we get 20
- If we approve neither → C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → both have max → uniform random → 50% chance C1 wins → 20, 50% chance C2 wins → 4 → expected = 12

Ah! This is **key**.

The outcome **depends on whether Player 1 approves C2**.

We **don't know** Player 1’s approval of C2.

But C2 is neutral — no cost or benefit → **probably they will approve it**, since it’s costless.

So let’s assume **Player 1 approves both contracts**.

Then:
- If we approve **neither**, then:
  - C1: 1 approval
  - C2: 1 approval
  → max = 1 → both have max → random choice → expected payoff = 0.5*20 + 0.5*4 = 12

- If we approve **C1 only**, then:
  - C1: 2
  - C2: 1 → C1 wins → we get 20

- If we approve **both**, same as above: 50% chance → 12

- If we approve **C2 only**, then C2 has 2 → wins → we get 4

So best is **approve C1 only** → get 20 for sure.

We can get **20 certainty**.

If we **don’t approve C1**, then even if Player 1 approves C1, and we don’t, then:
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 1 approval (if Player 1 approves C2)
→ tie → random → expected 12

So **we should approve C1 only**.

Even if we approve C2 only, we get 4 — worse.

So only good options are: approve C1 only (get 20), or approve neither (get 12) — so we prefer approve C1 only.

But wait — **is it possible Player 1 doesn’t approve C2?**

Suppose Player 1 **only approves C1**, not C2.

Then:

- If we approve **neither**:
  - C1: 1 approval
  - C2: 0
  → C1 wins → we get 20

- If we approve **C1 only**:
  - C1: 2 → wins → 20

- If we approve **both**:
  - C1: 2, C2: 1 → C1 wins → 20

- If we approve C2 only:
  - C2: 2 → wins → 4

So in this case, **approve C1 only** → 20, same as others.

So **in both cases** (Player 1 approves C2 or not), **approving C1 only gives us 20**.

If Player 1 does not approve C2, then even if we don’t approve C1, C1 wins (since 1 > 0), so we get 20.

But if we **don’t approve C1** and Player 1 **does** approve C2 → then tie → expected 12.

But if we **approve C1**, then C1 has ≥1, and C2 has ≤1 (if Player 1 approves C2 → C1 wins), or C1 wins anyway.

So **by approving C1, we guarantee C1 wins, regardless of Player 1's approval of C2**.

Whereas if we don’t approve C1, **we risk the tie** if Player 1 approves C2.

Therefore, to **maximize our guaranteed payoff**, we should **approve C1**.

And since C2 gives us only 4, while C1 gives us 20, we should **not approve C2**.

Thus, **best choice: approve C1, not C2**

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

- **C1**: approve → true (gives us 20)
- **C2**: do not approve → false (gives only 4, and risks tie)

Even if we approve both, we get 50% chance of 4 — worse.

So we **must not approve C2**.

response:
Let me analyze this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the base game from my perspective (Player 2)

The payoff matrix (my payoffs, Player 1's payoffs):
```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0    (10, 10)        (2, 6)
Player 2: A1    (20, 0)         (4, 4)
```

## Step 2: Find the equilibrium without any contract

From my perspective:
- If Player 1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (20) over A0 (10)
- If Player 1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4) over A0 (2)
- **A1 dominates A0 for me**

From Player 1's perspective:
- If I play A1: Player 1 prefers A1 (4) over A0 (0)

**Base game equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1: A0 gives +15 points (from other player), A1 has no payment.

Modified payoffs:
```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0    (10, 10)        (17, -9)
Player 2: A1    (5, 15)         (4, 4)
```

- For me: A0 gives 10 or 17, A1 gives 5 or 4 → **A0 dominates A1**
- For Player 1: A0 gives 10 or 15, A1 gives -9 or 4 → **A0 dominates A1**

**Contract 1 equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2: A0 has no payment, A1 costs -10 points (to other player).

Modified payoffs:
```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0    (10, 10)        (12, -4)
Player 2: A1    (10, 10)        (4, 4)
```

- For me: A0 gives 10 or 12, A1 gives 10 or 4 → **A0 (weakly) dominates A1**
- For Player 1: A0 gives 10 or 10, A1 gives -4 or 4 → **A0 dominates A1**

**Contract 2 equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- No contract: 4 points
- Contract 1: 10 points
- Contract 2: 10 points

Both contracts lead to the same equilibrium outcome (A0, A0) and give me 10 points, which is significantly better than the 4 points I'd get without any contract.

## Step 6: Decision

Since both contracts:
1. Lead to identical payoffs for me (10 points)
2. Are both strictly better than no contract (4 points)
3. Player 1 also benefits from both contracts (10 vs 4)

I should approve both contracts to maximize the probability that at least one contract is implemented, ensuring I get 10 points instead of 4.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game between two players. Each chooses an action: A0 or A1, with some probability. The payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Points | Opponent's Points |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 10           | 10                |
| A0          | A1                | 0            | 20                |
| A1          | A0                | 6            | 2                 |
| A1          | A1                | 4            | 4                 |

We are Player 1 (you) — your payoff depends on your choice and the opponent’s.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Best Responses Without Contract**

Let’s consider what the Nash equilibrium might be without contracts.

Assume:
- You play A0 with probability `p`
- Opponent plays A0 with probability `q`

But since we're deciding whether to approve contracts, we need to think about how contracts change incentives.

Let’s first compute expected payoffs **for you**, assuming the other player is rational and also optimizing their payoff.

**Your expected payoff if you choose A0:**
- If opponent plays A0: 10
- If opponent plays A1: 0
- So expected payoff = 10*q + 0*(1−q) = 10q

**Your expected payoff if you choose A1:**
- If opponent plays A0: 6
- If opponent plays A1: 4
- So expected payoff = 6*q + 4*(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Set them equal to find indifference point:
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So:
- If you think opponent plays A0 with > 0.5, you prefer A0
- If < 0.5, you prefer A1
- At exactly 0.5, indifferent.

Now look from the opponent’s perspective (Player 2). What's their best response?

Opponent’s payoff:
- Play A0: 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- Play A1: 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → impossible.

So they always prefer A1 when p < ?, but check:

Solve for when A1 better than A0:  
16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → 8p > -2 → always true for p ≥ 0.

So for any p ≥ 0, A1 gives strictly better payoff for opponent? Let’s test:

If p = 0 (you always play A1):
- Opponent A0: 2*1 = 2
- Opponent A1: 4*1 = 4 → prefers A1

If p = 1 (you always play A0):
- Opponent A0: 10
- Opponent A1: 20 → still prefers A1

So **regardless of what you do, Player 2 has a strict incentive to play A1**.

So in base game, **Player 2 will always choose A1**.

Therefore, from your (Player 1) perspective:
- Opponent plays A1 for sure.
- So:
  - If you play A0: get 0
  - If you play A1: get 4

Thus, **your best response is to play A1**, getting 4 points.

So equilibrium outcome: both play A1 → you get 4, opponent gets 4.

---

### **Step 3: Introduce Contracts – How They Work**

A contract is only active **if both agree** (via approval voting), and it modifies the payoffs based on actions chosen.

Key detail: **the additional payment is drawn equally from the other player(s).**

That means:
- For each action played, the player receiving the bonus pays it *to themselves* indirectly via "drawing" from the other player.
- But since the total amount must be distributed, the contract says:
  > “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of X points, drawn equally from the other players.”

This implies:
- When you play A0, you get +X points (from your opponent).
- So your opponent loses X points (since their payment is reduced by X, "drawn from" them).

> So effectively: **player who plays A0 receives +X from opponent**, and the **opponent loses X**.

Similarly, if the contract applies to both players (when approved), then:
- Whenever you play A0, you get +X from opponent.
- Whenever opponent plays A0, they get +X from you.

But note: **both contracts apply simultaneously** — if both approve a contract, the rules apply to both players.

So let's examine each contract.

---

### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1):**
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other player.  
> If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:
- When you (Player 1) choose A0: you get +15 from opponent (so opponent loses 15)
- When opponent chooses A0: opponent gets +15 from you (so you lose 15)

Note: This is symmetric in structure — both players benefit from playing A0, at the expense of the other.

So new effective payoffs:

#### Case 1: Both players pick A0
- Base payoffs: (10, 10)
- But both play A0 → both get +15 bonus
- Total: (10+15, 10+15) = (25, 25)

#### Case 2: You play A0, opponent plays A1
- Base: (0, 20)
- You play A0 → get +15
- Opponent plays A1 → no bonus
- So you get 0 + 15 = 15
- Opponent gets 20 − 15 (loss due to your A0) = 5
→ (15, 5)

Wait! Important: The **bonus is paid to the player who played A0**, and **comes from the other player**.

So only one bonus per round — whoever plays A0 gets +15, and that 15 comes from the other player.

In this case: **You play A0 → you get +15; opponent loses 15**.

So yes:
- Your payoff: 0 (base) + 15 (bonus) = 15
- Opponent's payoff: 20 (base) − 15 (loss from being "paid") = 5

#### Case 3: You play A1, opponent plays A0
- Base: (6, 2)
- Opponent plays A0 → opponent gets +15
- You play A1 → no bonus
- So opponent gets 2 + 15 = 17
- You get 6 − 15 = −9

Wait — can you go negative? The problem doesn’t prohibit it, so technically yes.

→ Payoffs: (−9, 17)

#### Case 4: Both play A1
- No bonuses applied
→ (4, 4) unchanged

So new payoff matrix under contract C1:

| You → / Opp → | A0             | A1            |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **A0**         | (25, 25)       | (15, 5)       |
| **A1**         | (−9, 17)       | (4, 4)        |

Now consider optimal strategies.

**From your (Player 1) perspective**, what should you do?

Best responses:

Suppose opponent plays A0:
- You: A0 → 25 vs A1 → −9 → prefer A0

Suppose opponent plays A1:
- You: A0 → 15 vs A1 → 4 → prefer A0

So **no matter what opponent does, you prefer A0**.

So A0 dominates A1 for you.

Now what about opponent?
Their payoffs under C1:

| You → / Opp → | A0             | A1            |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **A0**         | (25, 25)       | (15, 5)       |
| **A1**         | (−9, 17)       | (4, 4)        |

So opponent’s view:

If you play A0:
- Opponent A0: 25 vs A1: 5 → prefers A0

If you play A1:
- Opponent A0: 17 vs A1: 4 → prefers A0

So **opponent always prefers A0** too.

Therefore, **under C1, both players have dominant strategy A0**, so both will play A0 → final outcome: (25, 25)

So under C1, **you get 25 points** — much better than the original 4!

But — is this realistic? You’re proposing this contract. Would you vote for it?

Yes — because **it leads to you getting 25**, versus only 4 in the default non-contract case.

But note: **this contract requires BOTH players to approve** — otherwise it doesn't go into effect.

So even if you approve, if opponent doesn’t, nothing happens.

But your goal is to **maximize your total points received in the game**, so you care about what could happen if the contract passes.

And if C1 passes, you get 25.

Also: **is there a risk?** Only if the opponent votes against it, then nothing changes.

But you still want to **approve any contract that, if passed, maximizes your expected utility**.

So C1 looks great.

But wait: we must check **C2**.

---

### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2):**
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.
> If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

Same idea, but smaller bonus: +5 instead of +15.

So revised payoffs:

**Case 1: A0 vs A0**
- Base (10,10)
- Both get +5 → (15,15)

**Case 2: You A0, opp A1**
- Base: (0,20)
- You get +5 → 0+5=5
- Opp loses 5 → 20−5=15
→ (5,15)

**Case 3: You A1, opp A0**
- Base: (6,2)
- Opp gets +5 → 2+5=7
- You lose 5 → 6−5=1
→ (1,7)

**Case 4: A1 vs A1**
- No bonuses → (4,4)

Payoff matrix:

| You → / Opp → | A0            | A1           |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **A0**         | (15, 15)      | (5, 15)      |
| **A1**         | (1, 7)        | (4, 4)       |

Now evaluate best responses.

**Your (Player 1) view:**

If opponent plays A0:
- You: A0 → 15 vs A1 → 1 → prefer A0

If opponent plays A1:
- You: A0 → 5 vs A1 → 4 → prefer A0

So again, **A0 strictly dominates A1 for you**.

Now opponent’s view:

If you play A0:
- Opp A0 → 15 vs A1 → 15 → same → indifferent

If you play A1:
- Opp A0 → 7 vs A1 → 4 → so prefers A0

So opponent always wants to play A0 (if you play A0, indifferent, if you play A1, clearly prefers A0)

So in all cases, opponent prefers A0.

So again, **both players will play A0** under C2 → outcome: (15,15)

So your payoff: **15 points**

Compare to C1: **25 points**

So C1 gives you more.

### **Step 4: Strategic Consideration – Approval Voting & Winner Selection**

The contract with **maximum number of approvals wins**, selected uniformly at random among those tied for most approvals.

You must decide which contracts to **approve**.

Your goal: **Maximize your expected total points across all possibilities**.

Let’s consider possible outcomes depending on which contracts are approved.

There are two contracts: C1 (by P1), C2 (by P2)

Possible combinations:

1. **Only C1 approved** → C1 wins → you get 25
2. **Only C2 approved** → C2 wins → you get 15
3. **Both approved** → both have 2 approvals → maximum → one selected at random (50% each) → you get 0.5×25 + 0.5×15 = 12.5
4. **Neither approved** → no contract → base game → you get 4 (as shown earlier)

But note: **you cannot know opponent's vote** — but you know **they voted C2** (because they proposed it), though that doesn't mean they’ll approve it.

Actually, the proposal doesn’t imply approval. It just means they suggest it.

You don’t know their actual vote.

But the question asks you to decide **which contracts you approve**, based on **your own preference**.

So you must **strategically approve contracts** that, if implemented, maximize your expected payoff — taking into account what **might happen**.

But here’s the key: **since the winning contract is selected at random from those with max approvals**, the **number of approvals matters**, not just the content.

So you face a trade-off:

- Approving C1 gives you high payoff if it passes (25)
- But if C2 also gets approved, then both have two approvals → tie → possibly C1 or C2 selected

But if you approve C1, and opponent approves C2, then:
- C1: 1 approval (yours)
- C2: 1 approval (theirs) → tie → one picked at random → your expected payoff: 0.5×25 + 0.5×15 = 12.5

If you **don’t approve C1**, but approve C2:
- Then C2 has 1 (your approval)
- C1 has 0 → so C2 wins → you get 15

But wait — **can you approve multiple contracts?**

Yes — the instructions say: return JSON with entries for each contract. You can approve both or neither.

But the contract that wins is the one with **maximum number of approvals**. If tied, selected at random.

So your **strategy** is: **choose which contracts to approve to maximize your expected reward**

Let’s enumerate the possible scenarios.

Assume opposite player’s behavior is unknown. But we can assume they are rational — so we’ll consider what makes sense **from their perspective**, given their proposal.

But actually — you are only acting as Player 1. You don’t know opponent’s vote. But you can model it.

But let’s try to reason strategically.

Let’s suppose the opponent is **rational**.

Would they approve **C2**?

They proposed it — likely they believe it helps them.

Check their incentives under C2:

As Player 2, under C2:
- If both play A0: (15,15)
- If you play A0, they play A1: (5,15)
- If you play A1, they play A0: (1,7)
- If both A1: (4,4)

Earlier analysis: under C2, A0 is best response for them regardless of you.

So **if C2 is in effect**, they get maximum payoff when playing A0.

At worst, they get 7 if you play A1.

Even if you play A1, they get 7 vs 4 in base game — better.

So yes — **they prefer C2 to no contract**, because it encourages mutual A0, which benefits them.

In base game: they get 4.

Under C2: they get at least 7 (if you play A1) → even in worst case, they gain.

So **rationally, they will approve C2**.

Similarly, **would they approve C1?**

C1 gives **+15 per A0**, which is much higher.

But **under C1**, if they play A0, they get 25 (vs 15 under C2), but they also hurt you more.

But importantly: in C1, if they play A0, they get 25 (vs 15 under C2) → better.

Wait: yes! Same payoff structure:

Under C1: A0-A0 → (25,25)

Under C2: (15,15)

So **C1 is better for them too** (25 > 15).

But if **only C1 passes**, they get 25.

If **only C2 passes**, they get 15.

So clearly, **they prefer C1 over C2**, and definitely prefer C1 over no contract.

So **rationally, they would approve C1 if given the chance**.

But they **didn’t propose C1** — they proposed C2.

Why?

Possibility: maybe they don’t think you’ll approve it? Or maybe they are trying to signal something.

But as a rational agent, they should approve any contract that benefits them.

But now: **they can only approve one contract? Or both?**

No restriction — they can approve both, but only one contract can win.

But approving both would give C1 and C2 both 2 approvals.

But if they approve C2, and you approve C1, then both have 1 approval → tie → random choice → they get 0.5×25 + 0.5×15 = 20?

Wait no: **C1 benefits them more**, because if C1 passes, they get 25, if C2 passes, they get 15.

So if C1 and C2 both have 1 approval → either can be selected → they get 0.5×25 + 0.5×15 = **20** expected payoff.

But if they **only approve C2**, and you do not approve C1, then C2 wins → they get 15.

Whereas if they approve **both**, and you approve C1, then both have 2 approvals → tie → random selection → they get 20.

So better: approve both.

But why did they only propose C2? Maybe to increase chance of passing.

Alternatively: perhaps their goal is to **avoid C1** because it might not pass unless others approve.

But from their perspective — they want to maximize **expected payoff**.

But you are making the decision.

Let’s go back.

You care about your outcome.

Let’s assume the **opponent is rational and will approve any contract that improves their payoff in the best-case scenario**.

But we can’t assume they do anything unless they get benefit.

Best way: calculate **your best strategy**, knowing:

- You are Player 1
- You are choosing to approve C1 and/or C2
- Opponent (Player 2) proposed C2 and may approve it
- We suspect, due to incentives, they will **approve C2**, because it gives them more than base.

But will they approve C1?

If you **do not approve C1**, they might approve C2 → then C2 wins → you get 15.

If you do approve C1, and they approve C2, then:
- C1: 1 approval (yours)
- C2: 1 approval (theirs) → tie → random → you get 0.5×25 + 0.5×15 = 12.5

But if you **don’t approve C1**, and they approve C2, then C2 wins → you get 15

So **not approving C1** leads to **higher expected utility**?

Unless they **also approve C1**.

But they didn’t propose it.

Could they approve C1?

Only if they think it’s good for them.

Under C1, if it passes, they get 25 — much better than 15 under C2.

So **they would prefer C1 to C2**.

But **why** did they propose C2?

Perhaps because they are testing your willingness — or maybe they fear you won’t approve C1.

But **if you approve C1, and they approve C2**, then C1 and C2 both have 1 approval → tie → one randomly chosen → you get 12.5

But if you **don’t approve C1**, and they approve C2 → C2 wins → you get 15

So **in that case, not approving C1 is better for you**.

However, **what if they also approve C1?**

Then both C1 and C2 have 2 approvals → tie → random selection → you get 12.5

Same outcome.

But if you approve C1, but they don’t approve C1 (only approve C2), then:
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 1 approval → tie → you get 12.5

If you **don’t approve C1**, but they approve C2:
- C2 has 1 approval, C1 has 0 → C2 wins → you get 15

So **15 > 12.5**

So in **all cases where only C2 is approved**, you get 15

But if **you approve C1 and they approve C2**, you get only 12.5

So **your best move is to NOT approve C1**

Because:
- If you approve C1, you risk lowering your payoff from 15 (if C2 wins alone) to 12.5 (if tie with C2)
- But you never get 25 unless both contracts have at least 2 approvals (i.e., both players approve both)

But that’s unlikely: they didn’t propose C1, so unlikely they will approve it unless forced.

Moreover, you gain no benefit from approving C1: it only helps if C1 passes, but you only get 25 if C1 is the only winner (i.e., if they don’t approve it), but they might approve C2 → then tie → lower payoff for you.

So to **guarantee yourself at least 15**, you should **decline C1**.

Can you get more than 15?

Only if C1 is selected when it’s the sole winner — but that requires:
- You approve C1
- Opponent does **not** approve C1
- Opponent approves C2
→ then C1 has 1 approval, C2 has 1 → tie → random → 12.5
→ so even in best case, not 25

To get C1 as sole winner, you need:
- You approve C1
- Opponent does **not** approve C1
- Opponent does **not** approve C2
→ but opponent proposed C2 — very likely they will vote for it

So practically, **opponent will likely approve C2**, because it's better than base.

So if you approve C1, and they approve C2 → tie → you get 12.5

If you don’t approve C1, and they approve C2 → C2 wins → you get 15

So **15 > 12.5**

Hence, **you should NOT approve C1**

Now consider: **should you approve C2?**

C2 gives you 15 points under contract.

But if you approve C2, and opponent approves C2, then C2 has 2 approvals.

C1 has 0 → so C2 wins → you get 15

If you **don’t approve C2**, then even if opponent approves it, it has 1 approval — but so does C1 (if you approved it), or none.

But if you don’t approve C2, and they don’t approve it — no contract → you get 4

But if they **will approve C2**, as they proposed it, then:
- If you don’t approve C2 → C2 has 1 approval (theirs), C1 has 0 → so C2 wins → you get 15

Wait — **yes!**

Because:
- Opponent approves C2
- You do **not** approve C2
→ C2: 1 approval
C1: 0
→ C2 has highest → wins → you get 15

If you **approve C2**, opponent approves C2 → C2 has 2 approvals → wins → you get 15

So either way, **if opponent approves C2, C2 wins and you get 15**, regardless of your vote on C2.

But that only holds if **C1 is not approved**.

Because if you **also approve C1**, then C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → tie → random → you get 12.5

But if you **do not approve C1**, and **approve or not C2**, then:
- C2 has 1 approval (from opponent), C1 has 0 → C2 wins → you get 15

So even if you **don’t approve C2**, C2 still wins, because opponent votes for it.

Therefore, **your approval of C2 doesn’t affect outcome** — C2 will pass anyway.

But do you **want to approve C2?**

Yes — because it ensures that if you somehow don’t approve, but opponent does, C2 still wins.

But even if you don’t approve C2, and opponent does, C2 still wins.

So **your approval is unnecessary**.

But is there any cost?

No — approving C2 doesn't hurt you, and it ensures support.

But crucially: **if you approve C2**, and opponent approves C2, then C2 has 2 approvals → even safer.

But since C2 already has 1 (from opponent), and others have 0, it wins regardless.

So your approval **doesn’t change outcome**.

But the key point: **if you approve C1**, you risk reducing your outcome from 15 to 12.5.

So you **must not** approve C1.

Should you approve C2?

Well, it doesn’t hurt you.

And it increases the chance of C2 passing.

But it **already passes** regardless.

So **you are free to approve or disapprove C2**, but since it gives you 15, and no downside, you **might as well approve it**.

But actually — there’s no cost to disapproving.

But the contract is **only effective if approved**, but since opponent approves it, and yours is optional, it still passes.

So **your approval of C2 is irrelevant**.

But you gain nothing by disapproving it.

So **why not approve it?**

But the main issue is: **if you approve C1, it hurts you**.

So **best strategy: do not approve C1**

For C2: approving it **doesn’t harm you**, and it doesn’t reduce your payoff — you still get 15.

So **approving C2 is safe and beneficial** in terms of supporting the outcome you want.

Even if you don’t approve it, outcome is the same.

But to minimize risk, and follow principle: if a contract is beneficial and doesn’t hurt you, approve it.

So approve C2.

But could C2 fail?

Only if **opponent doesn’t approve it** — but they proposed it, and we believe rational players approve contracts that benefit them.

In base game: they get 4

Under C2: even in worst case, they get 7 → better

So they **will approve C2**.

Therefore, **C2 will pass regardless of your vote**.

So your vote doesn't matter.

But to make the system work, you can still vote.

Now, final step:

- **Do not approve C1**: because it risks creating a tie (if they approve C2), leading to only 12.5 expected payoff instead of guaranteed 15.
- **Approve C2**: because it helps ensure C2 passes (though it already will), and you don’t lose anything.

But wait — is there any scenario where **not approving C2** causes problems?

Only if they also don’t approve it — but they proposed it → very unlikely.

So safest is to **approve C2**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P1
response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate Modified Payoffs

First, I need to account for the contract payments. When a player chooses A1, they pay 10 points to the other player.

**My payoffs with contract:**
- (A0, A0): 10 + 0 = **10** (no payments)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 10 = **10** (I receive 10 from other player's A1 choice)
- (A1, A0): 6 - 10 = **-4** (I pay 10 for choosing A1)
- (A1, A1): 4 - 10 + 10 = **4** (I pay 10 but also receive 10)

## Step 2: Analyze My Expected Payoffs

Let's say the other player chooses A0 with probability p and A1 with probability (1-p).

**If I choose A0:**
Expected payoff = 10p + 10(1-p) = **10** (always!)

**If I choose A1:**
Expected payoff = -4p + 4(1-p) = 4 - 8p

This ranges from:
- When p=0 (other always plays A1): 4 points
- When p=1 (other always plays A0): -4 points
- Maximum value: 4 points

## Step 3: Compare Strategies

A0 gives me 10 points regardless of what the other player does.
A1 gives me at most 4 points (and can be negative).

Since 10 > 4 (and 10 > -4), **A0 strictly dominates A1**.

## Step 4: Optimal Strategy

When one action strictly dominates another, the optimal strategy is to play the dominating action with 100% probability. Playing A0 maximizes my expected payoff at 10 points, regardless of the other player's strategy.

response:
Let's go through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are Player 2. The game is a simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (Player 1 → rows, Player 2 → columns) is:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | (10,10) | (2,6)  |
| **P2: A1**    | (20,0)  | (4,4)  |

Player 2’s payoffs:  
- If P2 plays A0:  
  - P1 plays A0 → 10  
  - P1 plays A1 → 2  
- If P2 plays A1:  
  - P1 plays A0 → 20  
  - P1 plays A1 → 4  

So P2 prefers A1 over A0 **if P1 plays A0**, but prefers A0 over A1 **if P1 plays A1**.

This is a classic coordination vs. temptation game, similar to a variant of the prisoner’s dilemma or stag hunt.

But we are not yet at equilibrium. Let’s consider strategic behavior.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Rational Behavior (Nash Equilibrium)**

Let’s find the Nash equilibria.

#### Pure Strategy Equilibria?

- (A0, A0):  
  - P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → better off playing A1 → not equilibrium  
- (A0, A1):  
  - P1: plays A1, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 6, if switches to A0 → gets 10 → better → not equilibrium  
- (A1, A0):  
  - P1: A1, P2: A0 → P1 gets 0 → if switches to A0 → gets 10 → better → not equilibrium  
- (A1, A1):  
  - P1: A1, P2: A1 → P1 gets 4; if switches to A0 → gets 2 → worse → stays  
  - P2: gets 4; if switches to A0 → gets 2 → worse → stays  
  → **(A1, A1) is a pure Nash equilibrium**

So (A1, A1) is a stable outcome in the base game.

But is it optimal? No — both players get 4, whereas (A0, A0) gives 10 each.

So this is a social dilemma: mutual cooperation (A0, A0) is best, but individuals have incentives to defect.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contracts**

Now, **a contract can be introduced** via approval voting. The contract specifies **additional payments** for each action, **drawn equally from the other player**.

Important: "drawn equally from the other players" means that the cost of the bonus is taken from the other player — so if you get +15 for A0, the other player loses 15.

This is **not** a side payment from a third party — it's a transfer between players.

### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
- If a player chooses A0 → +15 points (paid by the other player)
- If a player chooses A1 → no additional payment

So:  
- If you play A0 → +15, and the other player pays -15
- If you play A1 → 0 change

This **favors A0** — it gives a strong incentive to play A0.

But note: **Player 1 proposed this**, and **you are Player 2**.

So Player 1 is trying to push the game toward A0, costing themselves in the process when A0 is played.

---

### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
- If a player chooses A0 → no additional payments
- If a player chooses A1 → no additional payments

So: **no changes**, just the base game.

This is a “do nothing” contract.

Since you are Player 2, and this contract costs you nothing (no extra burden), and gives you nothing extra, but keeps the game unchanged.

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate Your Incentives**

You are **Player 2**.

You want to **maximize your total expected points**.

Let’s analyze how each contract affects your optimal strategy and expected payoff.

---

#### **Contract C1 (Player 1’s proposal): +15 for A0, 0 for A1**

So, adjustments:
- If you play A0 → your payoff = base payoff +15
- If you play A1 → your payoff = base payoff (no change)

Similarly, if the other player plays A0 → they get +15 (and you pay -15)
If other player plays A1 → no change

So now, **your payoff matrix becomes** (after C1 is in effect):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | (10+15, 10-15) = (25, -5) | (2+15, 6-15) = (17, -9) |
| **P2: A1**    | (20, 0) → (20, 0) → no change (since no bonus) | (4, 4) → (4, 4) |

Wait — hold on: is the bonus **added to the player who plays A0**, and **subtracted from the opponent**?

Yes, the description says: "additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other players"

“Drawn equally from the other players” implies that the **cost is shared** if there are multiple players?

But there are only two players. So “drawn equally from the other players” → if you play A0, the other player pays 15 → you get +15, they get -15.

Yes — so the **net transfer** is **+15 to player who plays A0, -15 to the other player**.

So yes, the adjustment is:

- A0 players gain +15
- A1 players gain 0
- The opponent loses 15 if you play A0

So revised payoff matrix (P2 is you):

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1     |
|--------|----------|--------|
| A0     | (25, -5) | (17, -9) |
| A1     | (20, 0)  | (4, 4) |

Wait — no. Let's do it carefully:

- The **base** payoffs are:
  - (A0, A0): (10,10)
  - (A1, A0): (20,0)
  - (A0, A1): (2,6)
  - (A1, A1): (4,4)

Now, **add the bonus**: if you play A0 → you get +15 (from opponent), opponent gets -15

So:

#### Case: (A0, A0)
- P1 plays A0 → gets +15 → 10+15 = 25
- P2 plays A0 → gets +15 → 10+15 = 25
- But wait — **each player gets +15 if they play A0**, and **pays -15 to the other**?

Wait — this is important.

The contract says: *"If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."*

- "drawn equally from the other players" → if there are multiple other players, cost shared equally. Here, only one other player.

So **each player who plays A0 gets +15 from the other player**.

But if **both** play A0, then:
- P1 gets +15 from P2
- P2 gets +15 from P1
- So each gains +15

Similarly, if only one plays A0:
- The A0 player gets +15 from the other
- The A1 player pays -15

So **each A0 player pays +15, and the opponent pays -15**

So the **net transfer is +15 to A0 player**, and **-15 to opponent** regardless of what the opponent does.

So revised payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (you) → +15 from P1 | A1 (you) → 0 |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------|
| A0     | P1: 10+15 = 25; P2: 10+15 = 25 → wait no:
Wait — no.

Let’s re-express carefully.

Suppose **P1 plays A0**, **P2 plays A0**:
- P1 got +15 (because P1 chose A0) → gain +15
- P1 must **pay -15 to the other player** (P2) → so P1’s total = 10 + 15 - 15 = 10?
But that would mean **no net change**.

Wait — this is ambiguous.

Let’s parse the phrase: *"receive an additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other players"*

So: **you get +15**, and **the other player(s) pay the cost**.

So if **you play A0**, you get +15 **from the other player**.

So regardless of what the other player does, **if you play A0**, you get +15.

Similarly, if the other player plays A0, they get +15 from you.

So **each A0 player gets +15, and pays -15 to every other player who plays A1?**

No — the phrasing is: “drawn equally from the other players” → so the **cost is split among other players**.

But in a two-player game, if you play A0, the cost is drawn from the **other player** — so the **other player pays -15**, and you get +15.

So **net effect**: the person playing A0 gains +15, the other loses -15.

But what if **both** play A0?

Then:
- P1 plays A0 → gets +15 from P2 → +15
- P2 plays A0 → gets +15 from P1 → +15

So both get +15.

So the bonus is **independent** — it’s **per player** who plays A0.

So yes, if a player plays A0, they get +15, and the other player pays -15 **if the other player is not playing A0?** No.

Wait: “drawn equally from the other players” → if there are two other players, split. But here only one.

So if **you** play A0, you **get +15**, and **the other player pays -15**.

But if **both** play A0:
- You get +15 (from other)
- Other gets +15 (from you)
- So both get +15

Yes — so **the bonus is**:
- For **each** player who plays A0 → +15
- The **cost** is borne by the **other players**, so if you play A0, and opponent plays A0 → you get +15 from opponent
- If you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get +15 from opponent (who has to pay)
- If you play A1 → you get 0

So the **bonus is conditional only on your own action**, not on opponent’s.

So **each player who plays A0 gets +15 regardless of what the other does**, and the **other player pays -15**.

So the payoff adjustments are:

- If you play A0 → +15
- If opponent plays A0 → they get +15 and you pay -15

So final payoffs under C1:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|--------|---------|---------|
| A0     | (10+15, 10+15) = (25,25) | (20+15, 0-15) = (35, -15) |
| A1     | (10-15, 10+15) = (-5, 25) | (4, 4) |

Wait — no:

Let’s define clearly:

- You are Player 2.
- P1: Player 1.
- All payoffs are (P1, P2)

For each cell:

1. (A0, A0):  
   - P1 plays A0 → gets +15 → base 10 → 25  
   - P2 plays A0 → gets +15 → base 10 → 25  
   → (25, 25)

2. (A1, A0):  
   - P1 plays A1 → gets 0 bonus → base 20 → 20  
     - But: **P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +15**, so **P1 pays -15** → P1’s total = 20 - 15 = 5  
   - P2 plays A0 → gets +15 → base 2 → 17  
   → (5, 17)

3. (A0, A1):  
   - P1 plays A0 → gets +15 → base 2 → 17  
     - P2 plays A1 → gets 0 → but P1 gets +15 → so P2 pays -15 → P2’s base 6 → 6 - 15 = -9  
   → (17, -9)

4. (A1, A1):  
   - Both play A1 → no bonus → (4,4)

So full payoff matrix under **C1**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0         | A1        |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| A0     | (25, 25)   | (5, 17)   |
| A1     | (17, -9)   | (4, 4)    |

Wait, for (A0, A1):  
P1 plays A0 → gets 2 (base) +15 (bonus) = 17  
P2 plays A1 → gets 6 (base) → but P1 plays A0 → P2 must pay -15 (because P1 gets money from P2) → so P2 gets 6 - 15 = -9 → (17, -9)

Yes.

For (A1, A0):  
P1 plays A1 → gets 20 base, no bonus → but P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +15 → so P1 pays -15 → 20 - 15 = 5  
P2 plays A0 → gets 2 base +15 = 17  
→ (5, 17)

Now, **P2’s payoffs** (your payoffs) under C1:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | 25       | 17       |
| A1     | -9       | 4        |

Now, for P2 (you), this is very attractive.

- If P1 plays A0 → you get 25 (A0) vs 17 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1 → you get -9 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A1

But actually, the payoffs are asymmetric.

Let’s check unbeknownst to P1’s rationality, but we can analyze best responses.

But **you care about your own payoff**, and the **contract is only valid if enough players approve**.

But **you are Player 2**, and **you can approve or disapprove C1**.

Now, C1 is proposed by Player 1.

Let’s see: under C1, what is your expected payoff **if you play optimally**?

But to play optimally, you need to know P1’s strategy.

But we can look for equilibria.

### Best Response Analysis for Player 2 under C1

Your payoffs:
- If P1 plays A0:  
  - A0: 25  
  - A1: 17 → better to play A0
- If P1 plays A1:  
  - A0: -9  
  - A1: 4 → better to play A1

So your best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → choose A0
- If P1 plays A1 → choose A1

So you will **match** P1’s action.

Now P1’s payoffs under C1 (simplified):

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | 25       | 5        |
| A1     | 17       | 4        |

P1’s best responses:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 25 (A0) vs 17 (A1) → choose A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → choose A0

So P1’s best response is **always A0**, **regardless of your action**.

Thus, in equilibrium, P1 will play A0, and you will play A0 (as your best response).

So **equilibrium outcome under C1**: (A0, A0)

Your payoff: **25**

Previously, in the base game, the only pure NE was (A1, A1) → payoff 4.

So you go from **4 to 25** — huge gain.

But is this stable? Yes — both players happy with A0.

Now, **what about the other players?**

But you only care about **your** payoff.

Even if others are unhappy, **if the contract passes**, you get 25.

But here’s a catch: **C1 is proposed by Player 1**, and you are to decide whether to **approve** it.

If **you approve**, and if **Player 1 also approves**, then it passes (assuming approval is needed from both).

But the problem says: "**the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.**"

So if **both approve**, it passes.

But Player 1 proposed it — it is likely they **approve it**, unless it hurts them.

Let’s check **Player 1’s payoff** under C1 in equilibrium: (A0, A0) → 25

In base game, (A0, A0) was 10.

So Player 1 gains from it.

So **Player 1 will likely approve C1**.

So **if you approve C1**, it will pass.

Then you get 25.

But what if C1 doesn’t pass?

Then only C2 is available, or maybe none.

But C2 is “do nothing” — so base game.

In base game, equilibrium is (A1, A1) → you get 4.

But can you do better?

Under C2 (do nothing), you have no changes, so same as base game.

But perhaps with C2, the equilibrium is (A1, A1) → you get 4.

But **C2 is proposed by Player 2** — and you are Player 2.

So you **know** that **you will approve C2** — it costs you nothing.

Now, will Player 1 approve C2?

Under C2: no change.

So under C2, the game is unchanged — (A1, A1) is the only pure NE.

Player 1 gets 4.

But in base game, Player 1 could get 20 by playing A1 while you play A0 — but if you are playing A1, they get 0 if they play A1? No.

In base game: (A1, A0): P1 gets 20

But (A1, A0) is not equilibrium because if P1 plays A1 and you play A0, then you get 2 → you would rather play A1 → to get 4

But if P1 plays A1, you get 4 (playing A1) vs 2 (playing A0) → so you switch

Then P1 is at A1, you at A1 → both get 4

So only (A1, A1) is NE.

Player 1 gets 4.

But if Player 1 had wanted to get 20, they’d need you to play A0.

But you won’t, because it only gives you 2.

So no better NE.

So Player 1 gets 4 under base game.

Now, **C2** is proposed by Player 2 — so **you** will approve it.

But will **Player 1 approve it**?

C2 is a “no change” contract — so it **does not hurt Player 1**, and doesn’t help.

So **Player 1 is neutral**.

But if Player 1 has no incentive to approve it, they might **not approve**.

But we don’t know.

However, the **only way** to get a good outcome is **C1**.

Under C1, you get **25**.

Under C2, you get at most **4**, assuming base equilibrium.

But what if under C2, the outcome changes?

No — under C2, the game is unchanged → so (A1, A1) remains NE.

So you get 4.

So **C1 gives you 25**, **C2 gives you 4**.

Even though **C1 is proposed by Player 1**, it’s **very beneficial to you**.

You **should approve C1**.

But **is there a risk?**

Suppose **Player 1 does not approve C1** — then C1 is not approved.

But if **you approve C1** and Player 1 **does not**, then C1 has only one approval.

Now, C2 is proposed by Player 2 → you approve C2.

Will Player 1 approve C2?

C2 is neutral for them — no cost, no benefit.

So **possibly** Player 1 might approve C2 — or not.

But since the winning contract is chosen **uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**, we want to **maximize the chance** of getting the best contract.

Best contract for you is **C1**.

If **both approve C1**, it passes — you get 25.

If only you approve C1, and Player 1 does not, then C1 has only 1 approval.

If **C2 also has 1 approval** (yours), then both have 1 approval → random choice → 50% chance you get C1 → but only if it passes.

But if only **you approve C1**, and Player 1 **does not approve C2**, then C2 has only 1 approval (yours), C1 has 1 — tie → you get 50% chance of C1 → expected payoff: 0.5 × 25 + 0.5 × 4 = 12.5 + 2 = 14.5

But if **Player 1 approves C1**, and you approve C1, then C1 has 2 approvals.

If **Player 1 does not approve C2**, then C2 has only 1 (yours) → so C1 wins (max approvals).

So if Player 1 approves C1, then C1 passes.

Player 1 has **incentive** to approve C1, because in equilibrium they get 25, vs 4 in base → so **they will approve C1**.

C2: neutral — they might approve or not, but even if they don’t, C1 still wins if both approve it.

So **best case**: you approve C1 → Player 1 approves C1 → C1 passes → you get 25.

If you **do not approve C1**, then C1 cannot pass — even if Player 1 approves.

Then only C2 is possible.

C2: you approve it — you get at least 1 approval.

If Player 1 approves C2 → then C2 has 2 approvals → passes → you get 4.

If Player 1 does not approve C2 → then C2 has 1 approval → C1 has 0 → only C2 has approvals → passes → you get 4.

So **if you do not approve C1**, then **you are guaranteed to get 4**.

But if you **approve C1**, then **you get 25 if C1 passes**, which it does if Player 1 approves — which they will, since it’s good for them.

So **you are guaranteed 25**, as long as you approve C1 (and Player 1 approves — which they do).

Thus, **approval of C1 is strongly beneficial**.

C2 is “do nothing” — you get only 4.

So even though C2 is proposed by you, it’s **worse**.

Thus, you should **approve C1**, and **disapprove C2**.

But wait — can you approve both?

The problem says: “the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.”

So you can approve multiple contracts.

But if you approve both, then both have at least 1 approval.

C1: if Player 1 approves → 2 approvals
C2: if Player 1 approves → 2 approvals

Then both have 2 approvals → select one at random.

So you have 50% chance of C1 (25), 50% of C2 (4) → expected payoff = 0.5×25 + 0.5×4 = 12.5 + 2 = **14.5**

But if you approve **only C1**, and **Player 1 approves C1**, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 → C1 wins → you get **25**

So **better to approve only C1**.

So you should **approve C1**, and **not C2**.

Is there any downside?

Suppose Player 1 **does not** approve C1 — then C1 has only 1 approval.

C2: you approve → 1 approval.

If Player 1 does **not** approve C2 → then both have 1 approval → random → 50% you get C1 → expected payoff: 0.5×25 + 0.5×4 = 14.5

But if you **do not approve C1**, you get **4 for sure**.

So 14.5 > 4 — still better.

And **likely** Player 1 approves C1 — because it gives them 25 vs 4.

So **risk is small**.

Moreover, even in worst case (C1 doesn’t pass), you get **14.5 expect** vs 4 — so still better.

Thus, **you should approve C1**.

You should **not approve C2**, because it gives you less.

But is C2 better than nothing? No — it gives 4, while C1 gives 25 or better.

So final decision:

- Approve C1 → yes
- Approve C2 → no

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to evaluate how the contract changes the payoffs, and whether signing it would be favorable for us (Player 2). 

### Step 1: Evaluate Original Payoffs
First, let's recap the original payoffs:
- If both choose A0: Player 1 gets 10 points, Player 2 gets 10 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 20 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 6 points, Player 2 gets 2 points.
- If both choose A1: Both players get 4 points each.

### Step 2: Evaluate Adjusted Payoffs with Contract
The contract specifies an additional payment of 5 points for choosing A0, taken equally from the other player. This modifies the payoffs as follows:
- If both choose A0: Player 1 gets 15 points (additional 5 points from Player 2), Player 2 gets 5 points (additional 5 points from Player 1, but also loses 5 points to Player 1).
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 5 points (receives 5 points from Player 2), Player 2 gets 15 points (original 20 points minus 5 points paid to Player 1).
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 1 point (6 original points minus 5 points paid to Player 2), Player 2 gets 7 points (2 original points plus 5 points from Player 1).
- If both choose A1: No changes, each still gets 4 points.

### Step 3: Analyze Incentives
Let's analyze whether the addition of 5 points for choosing A0 creates better incentives for us (Player 2) compared to the original game.

The preferred choice without a contract:
- Without the contract, the dominant strategy for Player 2 is to choose A1 to maximize points (20 points if Player 1 chooses A0, and 4 points if Player 1 chooses A1).

The preferred choice with a contract:
- With the contract, if both players choose A0, Player 2 gets only 5 points, which is less favorable.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 2 gets 15 points, which is reduced from 20 points without the contract.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 2 gets 7 points, which is better than 2 points in the original game.
- If both choose A1, the points remain unchanged at 4 points each.

Given these modifications, the contract makes the choice A0 slightly more appealing. However, in the scenario where both choose A0, Player 2 ends up with fewer points compared to the original no-contract payoffs. The contract mainly reduces the payoff for the most favorable scenario for Player 2, where Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1.

### Step 4: Decision
Given the above analysis, the contract does not appear to substantially improve Player 2's outcomes. In fact, it seems to limit the best-case scenario payoff for Player 2. Hence, it would not be advantageous for Player 2 to sign the contract.

  "sign": false

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (without contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous move game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses between two actions: A0 or A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) |

This is a modified prisoner’s dilemma-like game.

Let’s analyze the incentives.

#### Best response for Player 1:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets: 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets: 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So P1’s best response is A0 if P2 plays A0, A1 if P2 plays A1.

#### Best response for Player 2:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets: 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets: 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So P2 **always** prefers A1, regardless of P1’s action → A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.

#### Nash Equilibrium:

- Player 2 plays A1 (dominant strategy)
- Player 1’s best response: if P2 plays A1 → choose A1 (gets 4) vs A0 (gets 0)
- So (A1, A1) is the unique Nash equilibrium → payoff (4, 4)

But note: (A0, A0) gives (10, 10), which is better for both players than (4, 4), but unstable because both have incentive to deviate.

So **without contracts**, players end up in (A1, A1) → 4 points each.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

Contracts **add** side payments based on the action a player takes.

Each contract specifies:
- If you choose A0 → you get **+X** points, paid by the other player.
- If you choose A1 → no additional payments.

The side payments are **drawn equally from the other player** → meaning:
- If a player chooses A0, they get +X, and the other player pays -X.
- A1: no payment.

This is equivalent to changing the payoff matrix by adding X to the payoff of the player choosing A0, and subtracting X from the other player.

But here, **only one player proposes the contract**, and **approval voting** is used: players vote "yes" or "no" for each contract. The **winning contract** is the one with the **most approvals**, chosen uniformly at random among those with the max number.

We are **Player 1**, and we must decide whether to approve **C1** (Player 1’s contract) and **C2** (Player 2’s contract).

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

- If a player chooses A0 → gets +15, paid by the other player.
- A1 → no change

So this modifies the payoffs.

Let’s compute the new payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2), incorporating C1.

Important: The contract is **binding only if approved**. But in this decision-making step, we are deciding what **we** approve. The final contract is only applied if it gets enough approvals.

But since we are deciding **what we approve**, and the final contract is chosen randomly among those with maximum approvals, we must evaluate: **Would I benefit from this contract if it were applied?**

Also, **we are highly incentivized to approve contracts that lead to better outcomes for us, if we believe they will be selected.**

So let’s assume the contract is **in effect**, and see how it changes the game.

#### C1 applied: All players get +15 if they choose A0, paid by the other.

So updated payoff matrix:

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (10 + 15 - 15, 10 + 15 - 15) = (10, 10) | (0 + 15 - 15, 20 + 0 - 15) = (0, 5) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (6 + 0 - 15, 2 + 15 - 0) = (-9, 17) | (4, 4) |

Wait — let's be careful.

The **payment is drawn from the other player**, so:

- When a player chooses A0, they get +15, the **other player loses 15** (but only if they are the one paying it).

So for each outcome:

#### Case: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0:
- P1 gets: 10 + 15 (from contract) = 25
- P2 gets: 10 + 15 (from contract) = 25
- But the 15 is drawn from the other player → so **each pays 15 to the other?**

Wait — this is ambiguous.

Let’s re-read:  
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn equally from the other players" — since there is only one other player, "equally" just means the entire amount comes from the other player.

So:
- If you choose A0, you get +15
- The other player pays −15

This is **symmetric** — both players get +15 for choosing A0, and each pays −15 to the other **if they don’t** play A0.

So in any case:
- Player who plays A0 gets +15
- Player who plays A1 gets 0 from contract (no change)
- The player who plays A0 **receives** +15 from the other player → so the other player pays −15

So yes: **when a player plays A0, they gain +15, the other player loses −15**

But if **both play A0**, then:
- P1 gains +15, and P2 pays −15 → so P1 gets +15, P2 gets −15 (in contract terms), but since P2 also plays A0, he gains +15 → net: +15 for each

Wait — this is **additive**.

So total payoff = base payoff + contract adjustment.

So for (A0, A0):
- P1: base 10 + 15 (A0) + 0 (no one paid him back — P2 played A0, so P2 gains +15, not pays)
- But P2 also gets +15

So contract effect:
- Each player gets +15 if they play A0
- No one pays anything unless they don’t play A0

So **independent of the other’s choice**, if you play A0, you get +15 from contract; if you play A1, you get 0.

The cost of giving +15 to the player who chooses A0 comes from the other player only if the other player plays A1?

No — re-read: “drawn equally from the other players.” That phrase is key.

So if one player chooses A0, they **get** +15, **paid by the other player**.

But if **both** choose A0, then **both** get +15 → where do the funds come from?

- P1’s +15 → paid by P2
- P2’s +15 → paid by P1

So it’s **mutual** — both get +15, and each pays −15 to the other.

So net effect: for (A0, A0): each gets +15 from the contract.

Similarly, for (A0, A1):
- P1 plays A0 → gets +15
- P2 plays A1 → gets 0 from contract
- P1 gets +15 → paid by P2 → so P2 must pay −15
- So contract adjustment: P1: +15, P2: −15

For (A1, A0):
- P1 plays A1 → 0
- P2 plays A0 → +15
- P2 gets +15 → paid by P1 → P1 pays −15

For (A1, A1):
- No one gets payment → 0 total

So now, revised payoffs **with C1** (only if approved and used):

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | 10 (base) + 15 (contract) = **25**, 10 + 15 = 25 → (25, 25) | 0 + 15 = 15 (P1), 20 −15 = 5 (P2) → (15, 5) |
| **A1 (P1)** | 6 −15 = −9 (P1), 2 + 15 = 17 (P2) → (−9, 17) | 4, 4 → (4, 4) |

So now, the matrix is:

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|--------|--------|
| A0 (P1) | (25, 25) | (15, 5) |
| A1 (P1) | (-9, 17) | (4, 4) |

Now analyze best responses.

#### Best response for Player 1:
- If P2 → A0: P1 gets 25 (A0) vs −9 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 → A1: P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant for P1**!

#### Best response for Player 2:
- If P1 → A0: P2 gets 25 (A0) vs 5 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 → A1: P2 gets 17 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant for P2**!

Thus, **(A0, A0)** becomes the unique Nash equilibrium under C1 → payoff (25, 25)

This is **much better** for **both players**, but especially — as **Player 1**, we go from 4 to **25**.

So **C1 is extremely beneficial for us**.

Now, would we **approve** it?

Yes — **if we believe it will be applied**.

But even if it's not applied, **we only care about the final outcome being the one with max approval**.

But note: **we are deciding whether to approve**. So we can approve C1.

But what about C2?

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

- If a player chooses A0 → gets +5, drawn equally from the other player
- A1 → no change

So similar structure, but +5 instead of +15.

So contract adjustments:

For each outcome:
- If a player plays A0, they get +5 from contract
- Other player pays −5
- If both play A0 → each gets +5 (and pays −5 to other), net +5 each

So update payoffs:

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | 10 + 5 = 15, 10 + 5 = 15 → (15,15) | 0 + 5 = 5, 20 −5 = 15 → (5,15) |
| **A1 (P1)** | 6 −5 = 1, 2 + 5 = 7 → (1,7) | 4, 4 → (4,4) |

So matrix under C2:

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|--------|--------|
| A0 (P1) | (15, 15) | (5, 15) |
| A1 (P1) | (1, 7) | (4, 4) |

Now analyze best responses.

#### Player 1:
- If P2 → A0: P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 → A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant for P1**!

#### Player 2:
- If P1 → A0: P2 gets 15 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → indifferent
- If P1 → A1: P2 gets 7 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P2 prefers A0 in both cases**, or at least is not worse off.

So **(A0, A0)** is still a Nash equilibrium.

Even if P2 is indifferent, they will choose A0 (since it doesn’t hurt).

So with C2, players still converge to (A0, A0) → payoff (15, 15)

**As Player 1**, we go from 4 to **15** under C2 (vs 25 under C1).

So C1 is better for us.

But would we **approve** C2?

Only if we think it might win, or it's acceptable.

But we are **Player 1**, and we **want to maximize our points**.

Now, the key is: the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So we must think strategically: what is the **impact of our vote**?

But we are not told what others will vote.

So we must assume rational behavior, and **evaluate whether C1 or C2 is better for us**, and if approving them increases the chance of getting a better outcome.

But note: **C1 and C2 are both escrow-like contracts that shift incentives toward A0**.

We see that:
- C1 leads to (25,25) → we get 25
- C2 leads to (15,15) → we get 15

So **C1 is better for us**.

Now, should we approve C1?

Yes — it gives us 25 instead of 4, and since it’s better, we **want it approved**.

But what if **drawing a lot of approvals for C1** makes it more likely to win?

But we are not restricted — we can approve both, or just one.

But the key is: **do we benefit from C2?**

Yes — we go from 4 to 15.

But we benefit **more** from C1 (25).

So overall, **we prefer C1 over C2**.

Now, if we **approve only C1**, then:
- C1 gets 1 approval (us)
- C2 gets 0
→ C1 wins (max approval is 1)

We get 25

If we **approve both**:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 2 approvals
→ both have max approval (2), so winner is chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance C1 (25 pts), 50% chance C2 (15 pts)

Expected payoff: 0.5×25 + 0.5×15 = 12.5 + 7.5 = **20**

But if we **approve only C1**, we get **25** for sure.

So by approving both, we risk getting only 15 or 25 — expected only 20, which is **worse** than 25.

So we should **not approve C2** — because it **dilutes the chance** of C1 winning and introduces a risk of getting a worse contract.

What if **Player 2 is more likely to approve C2**?

We don’t know — but we are only deciding our vote.

We assume **rational players**, so let’s think about **Player 2’s incentives**.

### **Step 5: Player 2's Perspective**

Player 2 wants to maximize their own payoff.

#### Without any contract: (A1, A1) → (4,4)

Under C1:
- If C1 is applied → (25,25) → Player 2 gets 25
- So Player 2 benefits from C1

Under C2:
- (15,15) → Player 2 gets 15

So Player 2 **strongly prefers C1** over C2 (25 vs 15)

And since C1 is proposed by **Player 1**, Player 2 would want it to win.

Therefore, **Player 2 will likely approve C1**, and may or may not approve C2.

But **C2 is worse** for Player 2 than C1, so they **will not approve C2** unless forced.

In fact, **Player 2 has no incentive to approve C2** — because:
- It gives them less than C1
- If they approve C2, but **C1 also has more approvals**, then C1 wins anyway
- If they approve only C1, and we approve it, it wins
- If they approve both, they might **harm** their own outcome by diluting C1's chance of winning

So **rational Player 2 will approve C1, and not C2**

So likely:
- Player 2 approves C1 → 1 approval
- We approve C1 → 2 approvals
- C1 wins → we get 25

(Why would we approve C2? It could reduce our expected payoff.)

Suppose **we approve both**:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 1 approval

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 12 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step, carefully analyzing the game, the contracts, and how they affect incentives.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are Player 1, and the other player is Player 2.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1       |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **P1: A1**    | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

We are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (simultaneously) to maximize our **expected points**.

But since we’re in a **decision-making game with possible contracts**, the twist is that **a contract can be approved**, and if approved, it **modifies the payoffs** by adding side payments.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

Each contract modifies the payoffs based on the action played.

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
- If a player chooses A0 → they get +15 points
- This 15 points is drawn **equally from the other player**, meaning:  
  → For each player choosing A0, the other player loses 15 points

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → You get +15, **the other player** loses 15 (due to the "drawn equally" clause)
- If **other player** chooses A0 → they get +15, **you** lose 15

Similarly, A1 → no additional payments

So the **contract modifies the base payoffs** by adding this transfer.

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
- If a player chooses A0 → they get +12 points, drawn equally from the other player
- A1 → no change

Exactly analogous to C1, just with +12 instead of +15.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Payoff Modifications under Each Contract**

We are trying to **maximize our own expected payoff**, considering **both the base payoff and the contract-induced side payments**.

Let’s define the **net payoff for Player 1** under each contract, depending on both choices.

We’ll consider the **entire payoff** as:
> **Base payoff** + **contract bonus/penalty for choosing A0**  
> (Note: You only get the contract bonus *if you choose A0*, and the penalty is applied if the *other player* chooses A0)

So:
- If **you play A0**, you gain +15 (under C1), **but** if **the other player plays A0**, they gain +15 → you lose 15 (same for C2)
- If **you play A1**, you get no contract bonus, and no penalty from your own choice.

So, contract payments depend on **both players' actions**.

Let’s now compute the **total expected payoff for Player 1 under each contract**, as a function of your strategy and the other player’s strategy.

But note: You are choosing your strategy **before** knowing the other player’s, and they are choosing independently.

You want to choose a strategy (probability of A0) to **maximize your **expected

But crucially: The **final contract is selected uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So you are not just thinking about **which contracts are better**. You are also thinking about **which contracts you should approve** so that **your expected payoff is maximized across the winning contract**.

However, since the **winning contract** is selected from those with **the maximum number of approvals**, we have:
- We **want the contract we approve to be among the most approved**, or else it won't be chosen.
- But if multiple contracts are approved by many, **one is chosen uniformly at random**.
- So your **expected payoff** depends on:
  - Which contracts you approve
  - How that affects the approval count
  - The resulting distribution over contracts that might win

So your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff**, considering:
1. The **payoff under each contract**, depending on your chosen strategy (which we can now optimize *for each contract*)
2. The **probability that each contract wins**, which depends on the approval counts.

But note: You can only approve or reject each contract. Your vote affects the approval count.

This is a **rational coordination game with strategic voting**.

Let’s proceed step by step.

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate the Effectiveness of Each Contract for Player 1**

We want to know: For each contract (C1 and C2), what is the **best response** strategy for Player 1 (in terms of maximizing expected payoff), and what is the **equilibrium** behavior?

But also: Since both contracts **treat both players symmetrically** in their incentives (A0 gives a bonus, A1 no change), they will affect both players’ incentives.

Let’s start by analyzing each contract independently.

---

#### **Contract C1: A0 → +15 (drawn from other player)**

Now modify the base payoff matrix with contract effects.

Let’s write the **total payoff to Player 1** under C1.

Player 1 is the row player. We’ll compute total payoff to P1 under each action combination.

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A0 (P1) | (10 +15 -15, 10 +15 -15) = (10, 10) | (0 +15, 20 -15) = (15, 5) |
| A1 (P1) | (6 -15, 2 +15) = (-9, 17) | (4, 4) |

Wait — let's clarify:

When **P1 chooses A0**, they get **+15** (contract).  
When **P2 chooses A0**, **P1** loses 15 (because P2 gains 15, and it's drawn equally from P1).

So:
- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A0:  
  P1 gets: base (10) + 15 (contract) -15 (other’s bonus) = 10  
  P2 gets: 10 +15 -15 = 10

- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1:  
  P1 gets: 0 (base) +15 (contract for A0) = 15  
  P2 gets: 20 -15 (because P1 chose A0 → P2 loses 15) = 5

- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0:  
  P1 gets: 6 (base) -15 (because P2 chose A0 → P1 loses 15) = -9  
  P2 gets: 2 +15 = 17

- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A1:  
  P1 gets: 4 (base) → no contract effects → 4  
  P2 gets: 4 → 4

So new payoff matrix for Contract C1:

| P1 \ P2 | A0        | A1        |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| A0     | (10, 10)  | (15, 5)   |
| A1     | (-9, 17)  | (4, 4)    |

Now, what’s the **best response for P1** under this contract?

We can look for Nash equilibria, or just find what P1 would do.

Let’s compute expected payoff for Player 1 if they play:
- Pure A0:  
  If P2 plays A0: 10  
  If P2 plays A1: 15  
  So regardless of P2’s choice, A0 is better than A1? Wait, only if P2 plays A0 or A1.

But we don’t know P2’s strategy. Let’s suppose P2 plays mixed strategy.

Let’s suppose P2 plays A0 with probability q.

Then:
- P1's expected payoff for A0: 10*q + 15*(1-q) = 10q + 15 -15q = 15 -5q
- P1's expected payoff for A1: (-9)*q + 4*(1-q) = -9q + 4 -4q = 4 -13q

Set A0 better than A1:
> 15 -5q > 4 -13q  
> 11 > -8q  
> q > -1.375 → always true

Wait, no:

15 -5q > 4 -13q  
15 -4 > -13q +5q  
11 > -8q  
→ q > -11/8 → always true since q ≥ 0

So for **all q**, 15 -5q > 4 -13q?

Let’s check q=0:
- A0: 15
- A1: 4 → A0 better

q=1:
- A0: 10
- A1: -9 → A0 better

So for **all q**, A0 dominates A1.

→ In Contract C1, **No matter what Player 2 does**, Player 1 **always** prefers A0.

Because:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 10 vs -9 → A0 better
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 15 vs 4 → A0 better

So **strict dominant strategy** for P1 under C1: **always choose A0**

And the payoffs:
- If P2 plays A0 → (10,10)
- If P2 plays A1 → (15,5)

So **under C1**, P1 is guaranteed to play A0.

Now, what about **P2’s best response**?

P2 gets:
- If A0: 10 if P1 plays A0, 17 if P1 plays A1
- If A1: 5 if P1 plays A0, 4 if P1 plays A1

But P1 will **always play A0**, so:

P2’s best response:
- A0: 10
- A1: 5 → so P2 prefers A0

Thus, equilibrium: **Both play A0**, payoffs: (10,10)

But even if P2 played A1, P1 still prefers A0 (gets 15 vs 4), so in no case does P1 deviate.

So under C1, **P1 is guaranteed to play A0**, and **P2 will also play A0**, so outcome is (10,10)

→ **P1 gets 10 points under C1**, with dominant strategy.

---

#### **Contract C2: A0 → +12, drawn equally from other player**

Same logic. Modify payoffs.

P1 chooses A0: gains +12  
P2 chooses A0: P1 loses 12

Now, new matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0           | A1           |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| A0     | (10+12-12, 10+12-12) = (10,10) | (0+12, 20-12) = (12,8) |
| A1     | (6-12, 2+12) = (-6,14) | (4,4) |

Check P1's best response.

Let P2 play A0 with prob q.

- P1’s expected payoff:
  - A0: 10*q + 12*(1-q) = 10q +12 -12q = 12 -2q
  - A1: (-6)*q + 4*(1-q) = -6q +4 -4q = 4 -10q

Compare A0 vs A1:
> 12 -2q > 4 -10q  
> 8 > -8q  
> q > -1 → always true

So again, **A0 dominates A1** for all q ∈ [0,1]

Thus, **P1 strictly prefers A0** regardless of P2’s choice.

- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 vs -6 → A0 better
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 12 vs 4 → A0 better

So P1 always plays A0.

Now P2: if P1 plays A0, P2:
- A0: 10
- A1: 8 → so P2 prefers A0

So equilibrium: **(A0, A0)** → payoffs (10,10)

→ **P1 gets 10 points under C2**

---

### **Step 5: Summary of Outcomes per Contract**

| Contract | P1's Payoff (equilibrium) | P1's Strategy | P2's Strategy |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| C1     | 10                         | A0 (dominant) | A0             |
| C2     | 10                         | A0 (dominant) | A0             |

So in **both contracts**, P1 gets **10 points** in equilibrium.

But wait — is that all?

Wait: under both contracts, P1 gets same final payoff: 10.

But is that the full story?

What if P2 does not play optimally?

But in game theory, we assume rational players. Since both contracts create a dominant strategy for P1 to play A0, and in both cases P2 best responds to A0 by playing A0, we end up at (A0, A0) in both cases.

So final payoff for P1: 10 in both contracts.

So from a **pure payoff perspective**, **C1 and C2 are equally good for P1**.

BUT: there’s a **strategic voting** aspect.

Remember: **The winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.**

You are Player 1.

You can:
- Approve or disapprove each contract.

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, which depends on:
- Which contracts are approved
- The number of approvals they receive
- Then, a random contract from the **most-approved** set is chosen.

Since both contracts lead to **same outcome** for P1 (10 points), we might think they’re identical.

But: **You are the one proposing C1**, and **C2 is proposed by Player 2**.

You know your own preferences.

So you **can** influence which contract gets approved.

Now, **what if we assume that other players also act rationally?**

Player 2’s incentive: they proposed C2.

What would Player 2 think?

Under C2: if Player 2 plays A0, they gain +12, but if P1 plays A0, **they lose 12**.

Wait — but in equilibrium, both play A0, so Player 2 gets:
- Base: 10
- Plus +12 (for choosing A0)
- Minus 12 (because P1 chose A0)

→ Net: 10

Same as C1: 10

But now — is C2 better for Player 2?

Let’s check Player 2’s perspective under C2.

P2's payoff:
- A0 vs A0: 10 → base 10 +12 -12 = 10
- A0 vs A1: 20 → base 20 +12 -12 = 20? No.

Wait — clarify:

When P2 chooses A0, they get +12 from contract.

But if **P1 chooses A0**, then since P1 chose A0, P2 loses 12 (because it’s "drawn equally from the other player").

So:
- If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 10 +12 -12 = 10
- If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1: P2 gets 2 +12 = 14, and P1 chooses A1 → no loss for P2, so +12 → total 14
- If P2 chooses A1 and P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 20 -12 = 8
- If P2 chooses A1 and P1 chooses A1: 4

Now, under C2, what is P2’s best response?

If P1 plays A0 (which, as we saw, P1 will always do in equilibrium), then:
- P2: A0 → 10, A1 → 8 → prefer A0

If P1 plays A1, A0 → 14, A1 → 4 → prefer A0

So **P2 also has a dominant strategy to choose A0** under C2.

So equilibrium: (A0, A0) → P2 gets 10

Same as base game.

So P2 is indifferent between C1 and C2?

Wait — let’s check P2’s payoff under C1:

C1: A0 gives +15, but if other chooses A0, lose 15.

So if both choose A0: P2 gets 10 +15 -15 = 10

Same as C2: 10

So P2 gets **10** in both contracts.

So **P2 gets same payoff** under both C1 and C2.

So from P2’s perspective, **C1 and C2 are equally good**?

But P2 proposed C2 — they may prefer it.

But since both lead to same outcome, they’re indifferent.

Wait — is this true?

Let’s check if **P2** also has dominant strategy under C1.

Under C1:

P2’s payoff:
- P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 if A0, 5 if A1 → prefers A0
- P1 plays A1: P2 gets 17 if A0, 4 if A1 → prefers A0

So yes — P2 also has dominant strategy A0 → equilibrium (A0,A0), P2 gets 10

Same as C2.

So **P2 gets 10 in both contracts**.

Thus, from **both players’ perspectives**, **contract outcome is same: (10,10)**

But **the contract that is used determines who gets to claim priority** (C1 was proposed by P1, C2 by P2), but the outcome is identical.

So **no player has a preference between C1 and C2** — both lead to same outcome.

But wait — what if **players care about fairness or power**?

No — we’re told the objective is **maximize total points received**.

So since **both contracts lead to P1 getting 10 points**, and **P2 getting 10 points**, and we only care about **our own points**, then **both are equally good**.

So why would we approve one over the other?

But there’s a **vote counting** component: **the winning contract is selected from those with maximum approvals**, uniformly at random.

So your **approval decision** affects the approval count.

Now, we need to **maximize the expected payoff**, which is:

> Sum over contracts:  
> P(contract wins) × (expected payoff if contract wins)

But since both C1 and C2 give **same** payoff: 10 each, we only care about **maximizing the probability that a contract we approve wins**.

That is, we want to **maximize the chance that a contract we approve becomes the winning one**.

So, if we **approve both**, then both have approval count = 1 (if no one else votes), but we don't know about others.

Wait — the problem says: *The winning contract will be selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.*

We don’t know how others will vote.

But we are **Player 1**.

We **propose C1**.

We are to decide whether to **approve C1**, and whether to **approve C2**.

We assume that **the other player (Player 2)** will vote **based on their own interests**.

Player 2 proposed C2.

They want to maximize their own payoff.

But as we saw, **both contracts give them exactly 10 points in equilibrium**.

So they are **indifferent**.

But they **proposed C2** — so maybe they will vote for C2?

They won’t vote against it — but may be indifferent.

But if they are indifferent between C1 and C2, they might approve both.

But to **maximize their own payoff**, since both are equal, they won’t care.

But if they approve **only C2**, and we approve both, then:
- C1: 2 approvals (us and possibly them)
- C2: 1 approval (only them) → if we don’t approve, C2 has 1, C1 has 1 → both max approval → random win.

But we are trying to **maximize our own expected payoff**.

Since **both contracts give us 10 points**, we are indifferent between which wins.

But we can *increase the chance* that a contract we approve wins.

So **we should approve contracts that are likely to have high approval**.

But we don’t know how others vote.

But here’s a key insight:

- C2 was proposed by **Player 2**.
- Player 2 might approve C2 (since it’s theirs), but might not approve C1.
- C1 was proposed by **us**, so we are likely to approve it.

But Player 2 might also approve C2.

But **Player 2 has no incentive to approve C1**, since C1 is a contract they didn't propose, and gives them same payoff.

But they might approve it if it doesn’t hurt them.

But **under C1**, do they get hurt?

No — same: 10 points.

So they are **indifferent**, and might approve both.

But **to be conservative**, let’s assume Player 2 will:
- **Approve C2** (since it's their proposal, and they don’t care)
- **Not approve C1** (since it's not theirs, and they don’t benefit from it)

But is that rational?

Actually, if Player 2 approves C1, they don’t lose anything — because the outcome is same.

So why wouldn’t they approve C1?

They are **rational**, but indifferent.

They might approve both, or only C2.

But to **maximize their expected payoff**, since both are equal, they don’t gain by approving one over another.

But if they approve C1, they **increase the chance that C1 wins**, which gives them same payoff.

So **no downside** to approving C1.

In fact, **approving C1 may help them if C1 becomes the winning contract, but since payoffs are equal, they are indifferent**.

But if **Player 2 approves both**, then:

- C1: 2 approvals (us + them)
- C2: 2 approvals (them + us) → if we approve both

Then both have same approval count → random winner → 50% chance each.

But if we **only approve C1**, and they approve C2, then:
- C1: 1 approval (ours)
- C2: 1 approval (theirs) → both max → random → 50%

If we **approve both**, and they approve only C2:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 1 approval → C1 wins for sure → we get 10

If we **approve only C1**, and they approve C2:
- C1: 1, C2: 1 → random → 50% chance of 10

So **we get higher expected payoff by approving both**, **if Player 2 approves only C2**.

But what if Player 2 approves both?

Then:
- If we approve only C1: C1: 2 (us + them), C2: 1 → C1 wins
- If we approve both: C1: 3, C2: 2 → C1 wins for sure

In both cases, **C1 wins**, so we get 10 either way.

But **if we approve C1 only**, and they approve C2 only → random win → 50% chance of C1.

But if they approve both, C1 still wins.

So actually, **our best move is to approve both**, because:
- We gain **certainty of winning** if Player 2 only approves C2
- We **don’t lose** if they approve both

Also, **if Player 2 approves C1**, then C1 gets one more vote, but since C2 is already approved, we might still want to be safe.

But **what if Player 2 does not approve C1**?

Then, if **we only approve C1**, C1 has 1 approval, C2 has 1 (theirs) → random win → 50% for us.

But if we **approve both**, then C1 gets 2 approvals, C2 gets 1 → C1 wins for sure → 100% chance of 10

So **better for us** to approve both.

Now, what if we **don’t approve C1**?

Then:
- C1: only if they approve it → 1 approval
- C2: at least 1 (theirs)
→ if they approve both, then C1:1, C2:2 → C2 wins → we get 10
→ if they approve only C2, C2:1, C1:0 → C2 wins → we get 10

So if we **don’t approve C1**, C2 wins with probability 1 → we get 10

But if we **approve C1**, and they approve both, C1 wins (since more votes) → 10

If they approve only C2, and we approve both → C1 wins → 10

If they approve only C2, and we approve only C1 → C1 and C2 each have 1 → random → 50% chance of 10

But worst case: **if we approve C1 alone**, and they approve only C2 → **50% chance of 10** instead of **100%** (if we approve both)

So **if we approve C1**, we **never get less than 10**, and we **sometimes get 100% chance**, compared to 50% if we only approve C1.

But what about **approving C2**?

C2 gives us 10, same as C1.

But we **don't gain anything by approving C2**, unless it helps us **maximize the chance that a contract we approve wins**.

But if we approve C1 → we get C1 to win more easily.

If we approve C2, but not C1, and they approve C2, then C2 has 2 approvals (ours and theirs), C1 has 1 → C2 wins → we get 10.

But if we **only approve C2**, and they approve C2, C2 has 2 approvals, C1 has 1 → C2 wins.

But if we **approve both**, and C2 gets 2 approvals (ours and theirs), C1 gets 2 (ours and theirs) → max approval = 2 → random → 50% for us.

Wait — that’s worse!

Because:
- If we approve both, and Player 2 approves both → C1: 2, C2: 2 → max is 2 → random win → 50% chance we get 10
- But if we approve **only C1**, and they approve both → C1: 2, C2: 2 → again 50%
- But if they approve only C2, then:
  - If we approve only C1: C1:1, C2:1 → random → 50%
  - If we approve both: C1:2, C2:1 → C1 wins → 100%

So the **only time we get 100% chance is when we approve both and Player 2 approves C2 but NOT C1**.

But if Player 2 approves both, then **any approval by us leads to 50%**, unless we can get more approvals.

But we can't.

So the **best-case scenario** for us is:
- Approve **both**
- Player 2 approves **only C2**

→ Then C1 wins for sure → we get 10

But if Player 2 approves **both**, then even if we approve both, it’s 50/50.

But in the case where Player 2 approves only C2, and we approve only C1, we get 50% → worse.

So we **always prefer to approve both**, because:
- In some cases (if P2 approves only C2), we **increase our chance from 50% to 100%**
- In other cases (P2 approves both), we **get same chance (50%)** as if we approved only C1

So **no downside**, but **potential upside**.

Therefore, **we should approve both contracts**.

Even though C2 gives same payoff, approving it doesn't hurt us, and may help us win by increasing the chance that C1 (which we prefer) gets more approvals.

Wait — but we don’t prefer C1 over C2 — they are equal.

But if we approve both, and C1 gets more approvals, it wins.

But we don’t care which contract wins, as long as we get 10.

So **we only care about maximizing the probability that a contract we approve wins**.

Now, if we approve **only C1**, and Player 2 approves **only C2**, then:
- C1:1, C2:1 → random → 50%
- We get 10 with 50% chance

If we approve **both**, and Player 2 approves **only C2**, then:
- C1:2, C2:1 → C1 wins → 100% chance → better

If Player 2 approves both:
- C1:2, C2:2 → random → 50% in both cases

So:
- If we **approve both**, our chance of getting 10 is:
  - 100% if P2 approves only C2
  - 50% if P2 approves both
- If we **approve only C1**, our chance:
  - 50% if P2 approves only C2
  - 50% if P2 approves both

So **we get higher expected payoff by approving both**, **assuming P2 is more likely to approve only C2 than both**.

But we don’t know.

But since P2 proposed C2, and C1 is not theirs, **P2 may be less likely to approve C1** than C2.

Thus, **a reasonable assumption** is that P2 will approve C2, but **may not approve C1**.

So **P2 approves only C2** with high probability.

Then, **approving both C1 and C2** gives us **100% chance of C1 winning**, whereas approving only C1 gives **50% chance**.

Therefore, **we should approve both**.

Moreover, **approving C2 doesn't cost us anything**, as it gives same payoff.

So **best strategy: approve both**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's analyze this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are Player 1 in a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|           | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **P1 A1** | (6, 2)  | (4, 4)  |

We are to maximize our own expected points.

Let’s find the **Nash equilibrium** of the base game (with no contracts), since rational players will likely aim for that.

---

### **Step 2: Find Nash Equilibrium of the Base Game**

Let’s suppose:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability `p`
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability `q`

We will look for symmetric or mixed-strategy equilibria.

#### **Player 1’s Best Response:**

Player 1’s expected payoff for playing A0:
- `10q + 0(1 - q) = 10q`

Player 1’s expected payoff for playing A1:
- `6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4`

Player 1 is indifferent when:
- `10q = 2q + 4`
- `8q = 4` → `q = 0.5`

So if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.5, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1. But Player 1 will prefer A0 if `q > 0.5`, A1 if `q < 0.5`.

#### **Player 2’s Best Response:**

Player 2’s expected payoff for A0:
- `10p + 2(1 - p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2`

Player 2’s expected payoff for A1:
- `20p + 4(1 - p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4`

Set equal:
- `8p + 2 = 16p + 4`
- `-8p = 2` → `p = -0.25`

This is not possible (probability can’t be negative). So Player 2 always prefers A1 unless p is very low.

Let’s check behavior.

If p = 0 (Player 1 plays A1 always):
- A0: 8(0) + 2 = 2
- A1: 16(0) + 4 = 4 → A1 better

If p = 1:
- A0: 8 + 2 = 10
- A1: 16 + 4 = 20 → A1 still better

So A1 dominates A0 for Player 2 — **A1 is strictly better for Player 2 no matter what Player 1 does.**

Wait! That’s critical.

Is A1 strictly dominant for Player 2?

Compare:
- A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2
- A1: 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4

Difference: A1 - A0 = (16p + 4) - (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 > 0 for all p ∈ [0,1]

Yes! So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2**.

So Player 2 will **always play A1**, regardless of Player 1’s action.

Then Player 1, knowing this, will choose:

- A0: gets 0
- A1: gets 4

So Player 1 will play A1.

**Nash Equilibrium**: (A1, A1) → (4, 4)

No matter what, the rational outcome is both play A1.

But is that the best possible? Can we do better via a contract?

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Contracts**

We now have two proposed contracts.

The **contract will be implemented only if both players approve**, but the **winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from all contracts that get the maximum number of approvals**.

Our goal: **maximize our expected points**, so we should approve only contracts that we expect to lead to outcomes in which our payoff is higher than the 4 points we get in the base game (A1, A1), or at least not worse.

Note: We are **Player 1**, and we can approve or disapprove.

The contract design affects the **effective payoff**.

---

### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other player(s).
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So:
- If a player plays A0, they get +15, but their opponent gets -15 (since it’s "drawn equally from the other players").
- If both play A0: Player 1 gets 10 + 15 = 25, Player 2 gets 10 + 15 = 25
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0 + 15 = 15, P2 gets 20 - 15 = 5
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0: P1 gets 6, P2 gets 2 + 15 = 17
- If both play A1: nothing changes — both get 4

Let’s build the **new payoff matrix under C1**:

|           | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | (25, 25) | (15, 5) |
| **P1 A1** | (6, 17)  | (4, 4)  |

Now, let’s see what happens if this contract is in place.

#### **Player 2's Best Response to P1:**

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 25 (A0) vs 5 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 17 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **no matter what P1 does, P2 prefers A0**. A0 is strictly dominant for P2 under C1.

Then P1, knowing P2 will play A0, will choose:
- A0: 25
- A1: 6 → so P1 plays A0

**Equilibrium under C1: (A0, A0)** → outcome (25, 25)

P1 gets **25 points** — much better than base 4!

But we are deciding whether to **approve** C1.

C1 is **proposed by Player 1**, so we are considering approving our own proposal.

If we approve C1, and **if P2 also approves it**, then it becomes active, and we get 25.

But **the contract is only active if both approve**.

Wait — no: **the winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.**

So we don’t need P2 to approve — we just need to **maximize the number of approvals** for contracts we approve, to increase the chance that **our preferred contract wins**.

But we are a rational player trying to maximize our **expected payoff**.

So we must consider:
- If we approve C1, it might pass (if it gets more approvals than others).
- But we must think strategically about whether C1 leads to better outcomes for us.

But here's a key insight: **approval doesn't guarantee success** — only that the contract is eligible, and if it's tied for most approvals, it might win.

But our **goal is to maximize expected points** — so we need to consider: **What is the effect of a contract on the play of the game, and therefore on our payoff?**

But the contract **only changes the effective payoff** — it doesn’t force any action. Players still choose actions to maximize their own **expected utility under the contract**.

So the **equilibrium** may shift.

But we can only **approve or disapprove**.

So our decision: **Approve C1?** We **would want** it to be implemented because it leads to 25 for us.

But **only if it’s implemented** — and it's only implemented if it's among the contracts with maximum approvals.

So our approval could increase the chance that C1 wins.

But we need to consider **both** contracts.

---

### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payment.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 10 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If a player plays A1, they lose 10, and the other player(s) gain 10 (since it's "distributed equally").
- If both play A0: (10,10)
- P1 A0, P2 A1: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 20 + 10 = 30? Wait — no: **Player 2 pays 10**, so P2 loses 10, P1 gains 10 → P1: 0 + 10 = 10, P2: 20 - 10 = 10
- P1 A1, P2 A0: P1 pays 10, P2 gains 10 → P1: 6 - 10 = -4, P2: 2 + 10 = 12
- Both A1: both pay 10 → P1: 4 - 10 = -6, P2: 4 - 10 = -6

So new payoff matrix under C2:

|           | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | (10, 10) | (10, 10) |
| **P1 A1** | (-4, 12) | (-6, -6) |

Let’s analyze this.

#### **Player 2’s Best Response under C2:**

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2: A0 → 10, A1 → 10 → indifferent
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2: A0 → 12, A1 → -6 → prefers A0

So if P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0.

Now Player 1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1: A0 → 10, A1 → -4 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1: A0 → 10, A1 → -6 → prefers A0

So **A0 is strictly dominant for Player 1** under C2.

Then P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

But if P2 plays A1, then P1 plays A0, so P2 is indifferent.

But P2 could play A0 (gets 10) or A1 (gets 10) — same.

Now, if P2 plays A1, P1 still plays A0 — so P2 gets 10 either way.

So **any strategy is optimal** — but let’s assume P2 will play A0 (or random). But **A0 is not strictly worse**.

But note: **Player 1 will play A0**, and **Player 2 is indifferent**.

So the equilibrium can be:

- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (10, 10)

In either case, **P1 gets 10**, P2 gets 10.

So under C2, **P1 gets 10 points**, regardless of P2’s choice.

Compared to base game: 4 → **much better**.

So C2 gives us **10 points**.

C1 gives us **25 points** (if implemented).

But can we get C1?

---

### **Step 4: Strategic Approval Decisions**

We are Player 1.

We decide whether to approve C1 and/or C2.

Let’s consider what happens in different approval scenarios.

We want the **expected payoff to be as high as possible**.

Note:
- The contract wins only if it has **maximum number of approvals**.
- Then, it is chosen uniformly at random from that group.

So we must consider:
- If we approve C1, how many approvals does it get?
- If we approve C2, how many?

But we don’t know how others will vote — but we can assume **rational players will approve contracts that improve their own expected payoff**, **assuming the contract is implemented**.

So we need to think about **what each player would think**.

But here we are only Player 1.

We control our own approval.

We need to decide: approve C1? C2?

Let’s consider the **incentives**.

---

### **Will Player 2 approve C1?**

C1: If you choose A0, you get +15 (from opponent). A1: no cost.

Player 2 knows that under C1, **A0 is strictly dominant** (as shown earlier), so P2 will play A0.

Then P1 will play A0 → both get 25.

So **Player 2 gets 25**, which is **better than their base payoff of 4**.

So **Player 2 will want to approve C1**, because it leads to 25 for them.

So **Player 2 will approve C1**.

Now, will Player 2 approve C2?

C2: A1 costs 10, A0 no cost.

Under C2, P1 will play A0 (dominant), and P2 gets 10 regardless.

So Player 2 gets **10** under C2, which is better than 4.

So **Player 2 also wants C2**.

But can they approve both?

Yes — approval is not exclusive.

So **Player 2 may approve both C1 and C2**, if they believe both lead to better outcomes.

But let’s suppose Player 2 is rational and wants to maximize their payoff.

- C1: leads to 25
- C2: leads to 10

So they **prefer C1**.

But they may still **approve both** to increase the chance that C1 wins, since C1 is better.

But **approval doesn’t require them to vote for only one**.

So likely, **Player 2 will approve both C1 and C2** — because both are better than no contract.

Similarly, **we (Player 1)** are deciding.

We want to maximize **our expected payoff**.

If contract is implemented, our payoff depends on which one.

- C1: we get **25** (if implemented)
- C2: we get **10** (if implemented)

But we can’t control whether it’s implemented.

Now, suppose:

- We **approve C1**, and **Player 2 also approves C1**, then C1 has **2 approvals**
- We **approve C2**, Player 2 also approves C2 → C2 has 2 approvals

But if **both contracts get 2 approvals**, then **both are tied for most approvals**, and **one is chosen uniformly at random**.

So **probability = 0.5** that C1 is selected, 0.5 that C2 is selected.

Then **our expected payoff** = 0.5 × 25 + 0.5 × 10 = 17.5

But suppose we **only approve C1**.

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (ours)
- C2: 1 (Player 2’s) → so both have 1 approval → both tied → selected with 0.5 probability.

Same as above.

Wait — no: **if we reject C2**, and Player 2 approves C2, then C2 has 1 approval.

If we approve C1, Player 2 approves C1, C1 has 2.

Then C1 has more approvals → **C1 wins with probability 1**

Is that true?

Yes! The winning contract is **selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1, then C1 is the **only one with max approval** (2), so it **wins with probability 1**.

Similarly, if C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → both are max → 50% chance each.

But if we **approve C1 and reject C2**, then:
- C1: 2 approvals (us + P2)
- C2: 1 approval (only P2)

→ C1 has max → wins 100%

→ We get **25** with certainty.

Now suppose we **approve C2 but reject C1**:
- C1: 1 approval (only P2)
- C2: 2 approvals (us + P2)
→ C2 wins with certainty → we get **10**

Worse than 25.

Now suppose we approve **both**:
- C1: 2 approvals (us + P2)
- C2: 2 approvals (us + P2)
→ both have max approval → 50% chance each → expected payoff = 0.5*25 + 0.5*10 = 17.5

Which is **less than 25**.

But is there a reason to reject C1?

Only if we think something is wrong.

But **we are Player 1**, and we want to **maximize our expected points**.

So let’s compare:

| Approval Decision | Outcome for Us |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Approve C1 only: | C1 wins → 25 |
| Approve C2 only: | C2 wins → 10 |
| Approve both: | 50% chance of 25, 50% of 10 → 17.5 |
| Approve neither: | Neither contract wins → base game → (A1, A1) → 4 |

So **best** is to **approve only C1** (and reject C2), so that C1 wins with 100% probability.

But wait — we assumed Player 2 approves both.

But **what if Player 2 doesn’t approve C1?**

Earlier we thought they would, because C1 gives them 25 > 4.

But let’s verify.

Under C1:
- If P2 plays A0, gets 25 → better than 4
- If P2 plays A1, gets 5 → worse than 4? 5 > 4 → still better.

Is P2 **always better off** under C1?

Yes — no matter what they play, they get more than in base.

- Base: 4
- Under C1: minimum is 5 (if they play A1 when P1 plays A0) → still better.

So **Player 2 strictly prefers C1 over no contract**.

Similarly, C2: they get 10 > 4 → also better.

So **Player 2 will approve both C1 and C2**.

Thus:

- If **we approve only C1**, then:
  - C1: 2 approvals → wins
  - C2: 1 approval → loses
  → We get 25

- If we approve both:
  - C1: 2 → max
  - C2: 2 → max
  → 50% chance → 17.5 < 25

- If we approve only C2:
  - C1: 1 → loses
  - C2: 2 → wins
  → We get 10

- If we approve neither:
  - No contract → base game → 4

So **our best strategy is to approve C1 and reject C2**.

But wait — is there any downside to approving C1?

No. It increases the chance that C1 wins, and if it wins, we get 25.

Approving C2 only reduces our expected payoff (since it gives us less and creates a tie).

So **we should approve C1 and reject C2**.

### ✅ Final Decision:

- **C1**: approve → true
- **C2**: reject → false

But wait — the question says: **you are to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of**.

We must return:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}
```

### ✅ Final Answer:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (without contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous move game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses between two actions: A0 or A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) |

This is a modified prisoner’s dilemma-like game.

Let’s analyze the incentives.

#### Best response for Player 1:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets: 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets: 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So P1’s best response is A0 if P2 plays A0, A1 if P2 plays A1.

#### Best response for Player 2:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets: 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets: 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So P2 **always** prefers A1, regardless of P1’s action → A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.

#### Nash Equilibrium:

- Player 2 plays A1 (dominant strategy)
- Player 1’s best response: if P2 plays A1 → choose A1 (gets 4) vs A0 (gets 0)
- So (A1, A1) is the unique Nash equilibrium → payoff (4, 4)

But note: (A0, A0) gives (10, 10), which is better for both players than (4, 4), but unstable because both have incentive to deviate.

So **without contracts**, players end up in (A1, A1) → 4 points each.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

Contracts **add** side payments based on the action a player takes.

Each contract specifies:
- If you choose A0 → you get **+X** points, paid by the other player.
- If you choose A1 → no additional payments.

The side payments are **drawn equally from the other player** → meaning:
- If a player chooses A0, they get +X, and the other player pays -X.
- A1: no payment.

This is equivalent to changing the payoff matrix by adding X to the payoff of the player choosing A0, and subtracting X from the other player.

But here, **only one player proposes the contract**, and **approval voting** is used: players vote "yes" or "no" for each contract. The **winning contract** is the one with the **most approvals**, chosen uniformly at random among those with the max number.

We are **Player 1**, and we must decide whether to approve **C1** (Player 1’s contract) and **C2** (Player 2’s contract).

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

- If a player chooses A0 → gets +15, paid by the other player.
- A1 → no change

So this modifies the payoffs.

Let’s compute the new payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2), incorporating C1.

Important: The contract is **binding only if approved**. But in this decision-making step, we are deciding what **we** approve. The final contract is only applied if it gets enough approvals.

But since we are deciding **what we approve**, and the final contract is chosen randomly among those with maximum approvals, we must evaluate: **Would I benefit from this contract if it were applied?**

Also, **we are highly incentivized to approve contracts that lead to better outcomes for us, if we believe they will be selected.**

So let’s assume the contract is **in effect**, and see how it changes the game.

#### C1 applied: All players get +15 if they choose A0, paid by the other.

So updated payoff matrix:

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (10 + 15 - 15, 10 + 15 - 15) = (10, 10) | (0 + 15 - 15, 20 + 0 - 15) = (0, 5) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (6 + 0 - 15, 2 + 15 - 0) = (-9, 17) | (4, 4) |

Wait — let's be careful.

The **payment is drawn from the other player**, so:

- When a player chooses A0, they get +15, the **other player loses 15** (but only if they are the one paying it).

So for each outcome:

#### Case: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0:
- P1 gets: 10 + 15 (from contract) = 25
- P2 gets: 10 + 15 (from contract) = 25
- But the 15 is drawn from the other player → so **each pays 15 to the other?**

Wait — this is ambiguous.

Let’s re-read:  
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn equally from the other players" — since there is only one other player, "equally" just means the entire amount comes from the other player.

So:
- If you choose A0, you get +15
- The other player pays −15

This is **symmetric** — both players get +15 for choosing A0, and each pays −15 to the other **if they don’t** play A0.

So in any case:
- Player who plays A0 gets +15
- Player who plays A1 gets 0 from contract (no change)
- The player who plays A0 **receives** +15 from the other player → so the other player pays −15

So yes: **when a player plays A0, they gain +15, the other player loses −15**

But if **both play A0**, then:
- P1 gains +15, and P2 pays −15 → so P1 gets +15, P2 gets −15 (in contract terms), but since P2 also plays A0, he gains +15 → net: +15 for each

Wait — this is **additive**.

So total payoff = base payoff + contract adjustment.

So for (A0, A0):
- P1: base 10 + 15 (A0) + 0 (no one paid him back — P2 played A0, so P2 gains +15, not pays)
- But P2 also gets +15

So contract effect:
- Each player gets +15 if they play A0
- No one pays anything unless they don’t play A0

So **independent of the other’s choice**, if you play A0, you get +15 from contract; if you play A1, you get 0.

The cost of giving +15 to the player who chooses A0 comes from the other player only if the other player plays A1?

No — re-read: “drawn equally from the other players.” That phrase is key.

So if one player chooses A0, they **get** +15, **paid by the other player**.

But if **both** choose A0, then **both** get +15 → where do the funds come from?

- P1’s +15 → paid by P2
- P2’s +15 → paid by P1

So it’s **mutual** — both get +15, and each pays −15 to the other.

So net effect: for (A0, A0): each gets +15 from the contract.

Similarly, for (A0, A1):
- P1 plays A0 → gets +15
- P2 plays A1 → gets 0 from contract
- P1 gets +15 → paid by P2 → so P2 must pay −15
- So contract adjustment: P1: +15, P2: −15

For (A1, A0):
- P1 plays A1 → 0
- P2 plays A0 → +15
- P2 gets +15 → paid by P1 → P1 pays −15

For (A1, A1):
- No one gets payment → 0 total

So now, revised payoffs **with C1** (only if approved and used):

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | 10 (base) + 15 (contract) = **25**, 10 + 15 = 25 → (25, 25) | 0 + 15 = 15 (P1), 20 −15 = 5 (P2) → (15, 5) |
| **A1 (P1)** | 6 −15 = −9 (P1), 2 + 15 = 17 (P2) → (−9, 17) | 4, 4 → (4, 4) |

So now, the matrix is:

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|--------|--------|
| A0 (P1) | (25, 25) | (15, 5) |
| A1 (P1) | (-9, 17) | (4, 4) |

Now analyze best responses.

#### Best response for Player 1:
- If P2 → A0: P1 gets 25 (A0) vs −9 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 → A1: P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant for P1**!

#### Best response for Player 2:
- If P1 → A0: P2 gets 25 (A0) vs 5 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 → A1: P2 gets 17 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant for P2**!

Thus, **(A0, A0)** becomes the unique Nash equilibrium under C1 → payoff (25, 25)

This is **much better** for **both players**, but especially — as **Player 1**, we go from 4 to **25**.

So **C1 is extremely beneficial for us**.

Now, would we **approve** it?

Yes — **if we believe it will be applied**.

But even if it's not applied, **we only care about the final outcome being the one with max approval**.

But note: **we are deciding whether to approve**. So we can approve C1.

But what about C2?

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

- If a player chooses A0 → gets +5, drawn equally from the other player
- A1 → no change

So similar structure, but +5 instead of +15.

So contract adjustments:

For each outcome:
- If a player plays A0, they get +5 from contract
- Other player pays −5
- If both play A0 → each gets +5 (and pays −5 to other), net +5 each

So update payoffs:

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | 10 + 5 = 15, 10 + 5 = 15 → (15,15) | 0 + 5 = 5, 20 −5 = 15 → (5,15) |
| **A1 (P1)** | 6 −5 = 1, 2 + 5 = 7 → (1,7) | 4, 4 → (4,4) |

So matrix under C2:

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|--------|--------|
| A0 (P1) | (15, 15) | (5, 15) |
| A1 (P1) | (1, 7) | (4, 4) |

Now analyze best responses.

#### Player 1:
- If P2 → A0: P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 → A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant for P1**!

#### Player 2:
- If P1 → A0: P2 gets 15 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → indifferent
- If P1 → A1: P2 gets 7 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P2 prefers A0 in both cases**, or at least is not worse off.

So **(A0, A0)** is still a Nash equilibrium.

Even if P2 is indifferent, they will choose A0 (since it doesn’t hurt).

So with C2, players still converge to (A0, A0) → payoff (15, 15)

**As Player 1**, we go from 4 to **15** under C2 (vs 25 under C1).

So C1 is better for us.

But would we **approve** C2?

Only if we think it might win, or it's acceptable.

But we are **Player 1**, and we **want to maximize our points**.

Now, the key is: the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So we must think strategically: what is the **impact of our vote**?

But we are not told what others will vote.

So we must assume rational behavior, and **evaluate whether C1 or C2 is better for us**, and if approving them increases the chance of getting a better outcome.

But note: **C1 and C2 are both escrow-like contracts that shift incentives toward A0**.

We see that:
- C1 leads to (25,25) → we get 25
- C2 leads to (15,15) → we get 15

So **C1 is better for us**.

Now, should we approve C1?

Yes — it gives us 25 instead of 4, and since it’s better, we **want it approved**.

But what if **drawing a lot of approvals for C1** makes it more likely to win?

But we are not restricted — we can approve both, or just one.

But the key is: **do we benefit from C2?**

Yes — we go from 4 to 15.

But we benefit **more** from C1 (25).

So overall, **we prefer C1 over C2**.

Now, if we **approve only C1**, then:
- C1 gets 1 approval (us)
- C2 gets 0
→ C1 wins (max approval is 1)

We get 25

If we **approve both**:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 2 approvals
→ both have max approval (2), so winner is chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance C1 (25 pts), 50% chance C2 (15 pts)

Expected payoff: 0.5×25 + 0.5×15 = 12.5 + 7.5 = **20**

But if we **approve only C1**, we get **25** for sure.

So by approving both, we risk getting only 15 or 25 — expected only 20, which is **worse** than 25.

So we should **not approve C2** — because it **dilutes the chance** of C1 winning and introduces a risk of getting a worse contract.

What if **Player 2 is more likely to approve C2**?

We don’t know — but we are only deciding our vote.

We assume **rational players**, so let’s think about **Player 2’s incentives**.

### **Step 5: Player 2's Perspective**

Player 2 wants to maximize their own payoff.

#### Without any contract: (A1, A1) → (4,4)

Under C1:
- If C1 is applied → (25,25) → Player 2 gets 25
- So Player 2 benefits from C1

Under C2:
- (15,15) → Player 2 gets 15

So Player 2 **strongly prefers C1** over C2 (25 vs 15)

And since C1 is proposed by **Player 1**, Player 2 would want it to win.

Therefore, **Player 2 will likely approve C1**, and may or may not approve C2.

But **C2 is worse** for Player 2 than C1, so they **will not approve C2** unless forced.

In fact, **Player 2 has no incentive to approve C2** — because:
- It gives them less than C1
- If they approve C2, but **C1 also has more approvals**, then C1 wins anyway
- If they approve only C1, and we approve it, it wins
- If they approve both, they might **harm** their own outcome by diluting C1's chance of winning

So **rational Player 2 will approve C1, and not C2**

So likely:
- Player 2 approves C1 → 1 approval
- We approve C1 → 2 approvals
- C1 wins → we get 25

(Why would we approve C2? It could reduce our expected payoff.)

Suppose **we approve both**:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 1 approval

The final contract is only applied if it gets enough approvals.\n\nBut since we are deciding **what we approve**, and the final contract is chosen randomly among those with maximum approvals, we must evaluate: **Would I benefit from this contract if it were applied?**\n\nAlso, **we are highly incentivized to approve contracts that lead to better outcomes for us, if we believe they will be selected.**\n\nSo let’s assume the contract is **in effect**, and see how it changes the game.\n\n#### C1 applied: All players get +15 if they choose A0, paid by the other.\n\nSo updated payoff matrix:\n\n|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| **A0 (P1)** | (10 + 15 - 15, 10 + 15 - 15) = (10, 10) | (0 + 15 - 15, 20 + 0 - 15) = (0, 5) |\n| **A1 (P1)** | (6 + 0 - 15, 2 + 15 - 0) = (-9, 17) | (4, 4) |\n\nWait — let\'s be careful.\n\nThe **payment is drawn from the other player**, so:\n\n- When a player chooses A0, they get +15, the **other player loses 15** (but only if they are the one paying it).\n\nSo for each outcome:\n\n#### Case: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0:\n- P1 gets: 10 + 15 (from contract) = 25\n- P2 gets: 10 + 15 (from contract) = 25\n- But the 15 is drawn from the other player → so **each pays 15 to the other?**\n\nWait — this is ambiguous.\n\nLet’s re-read:  \n> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."\n\n"Drawn equally from the other players" — since there is only one other player, "equally" just means the entire amount comes from the other player.\n\nSo:\n- If you choose A0, you get +15\n- The other player pays −15\n\nThis is **symmetric** — both players get +15 for choosing A0, and each pays −15 to the other **if they don’t** play A0.\n\nSo in any case:\n- Player who plays A0 gets +15\n- Player who plays A1 gets 0 from contract (no change)\n- The player who plays A0 **receives** +15 from the other player → so the other player pays −15\n\nSo yes: **when a player plays A0, they gain +15, the other player loses −15**\n\nBut if **both play A0**, then:\n- P1 gains +15, and P2 pays −15 → so P1 gets +15, P2 gets −15 (in contract terms), but since P2 also plays A0, he gains +15 → net: +15 for each\n\nWait — this is **additive**.\n\nSo total payoff = base payoff + contract adjustment.\n\nSo for (A0, A0):\n- P1: base 10 + 15 (A0) + 0 (no one paid him back — P2 played A0, so P2 gains +15, not pays)\n- But P2 also gets +15\n\nSo contract effect:\n- Each player gets +15 if they play A0\n- No one pays anything unless they don’t play A0\n\nSo **independent of the other’s choice**, if you play A0, you get +15 from contract; if you play A1, you get 0.\n\nThe cost of giving +15 to the player who chooses A0 comes from the other player only if the other player plays A1?\n\nNo — re-read: “drawn equally from the other players.” That phrase is key.\n\nSo if one player chooses A0, they **get** +15, **paid by the other player**.\n\nBut if **both** choose A0, then **both** get +15 → where do the funds come from?\n\n- P1’s +15 → paid by P2\n- P2’s +15 → paid by P1\n\nSo it’s **mutual** — both get +15, and each pays −15 to the other.\n\nSo net effect: for (A0, A0): each gets +15 from the contract.\n\nSimilarly, for (A0, A1):\n- P1 plays A0 → gets +15\n- P2 plays A1 → gets 0 from contract\n- P1 gets +15 → paid by P2 → so P2 must pay −15\n- So contract adjustment: P1: +15, P2: −15\n\nFor (A1, A0):\n- P1 plays A1 → 0\n- P2 plays A0 → +15\n- P2 gets +15 → paid by P1 → P1 pays −15\n\nFor (A1, A1):\n- No one gets payment → 0 total\n\nSo now, revised payoffs **with C1** (only if approved and used):\n\n|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| **A0 (P1)** | 10 (base) + 15 (contract) = **25**, 10 + 15 = 25 → (25, 25) | 0 + 15 = 15 (P1), 20 −15 = 5 (P2) → (15, 5) |\n| **A1 (P1)** | 6 −15 = −9 (P1), 2 + 15 = 17 (P2) → (−9, 17) | 4, 4 → (4, 4) |\n\nSo now, the matrix is:\n\n|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| A0 (P1) | (25, 25) | (15, 5) |\n| A1 (P1) | (-9, 17) | (4, 4) |\n\nNow analyze best responses.\n\n#### Best response for Player 1:\n- If P2 → A0: P1 gets 25 (A0) vs −9 (A1) → prefers A0\n- If P2 → A1: P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0\n\nSo **A0 is dominant for P1**!\n\n#### Best response for Player 2:\n- If P1 → A0: P2 gets 25 (A0) vs 5 (A1) → prefers A0\n- If P1 → A1: P2 gets 17 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0\n\nSo **A0 is dominant for P2**!\n\nThus, **(A0, A0)** becomes the unique Nash equilibrium under C1 → payoff (25, 25)\n\nThis is **much better** for **both players**, but especially — as **Player 1**, we go from 4 to **25**.\n\nSo **C1 is extremely beneficial for us**.\n\nNow, would we **approve** it?\n\nYes — **if we believe it will be applied**.\n\nBut even if it\'s not applied, **we only care about the final outcome being the one with max approval**.\n\nBut note: **we are deciding whether to approve**. So we can approve C1.\n\nBut what about C2?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**\n\n- If a player chooses A0 → gets +5, drawn equally from the other player\n- A1 → no change\n\nSo similar structure, but +5 instead of +15.\n\nSo contract adjustments:\n\nFor each outcome:\n- If a player plays A0, they get +5 from contract\n- Other player pays −5\n- If both play A0 → each gets +5 (and pays −5 to other), net +5 each\n\nSo update payoffs:\n\n|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| **A0 (P1)** | 10 + 5 = 15, 10 + 5 = 15 → (15,15) | 0 + 5 = 5, 20 −5 = 15 → (5,15) |\n| **A1 (P1)** | 6 −5 = 1, 2 + 5 = 7 → (1,7) | 4, 4 → (4,4) |\n\nSo matrix under C2:\n\n|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| A0 (P1) | (15, 15) | (5, 15) |\n| A1 (P1) | (1, 7) | (4, 4) |\n\nNow analyze best responses.\n\n#### Player 1:\n- If P2 → A0: P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0\n- If P2 → A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0\n\nSo **A0 is dominant for P1**!\n\n#### Player 2:\n- If P1 → A0: P2 gets 15 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → indifferent\n- If P1 → A1: P2 gets 7 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0\n\nSo **P2 prefers A0 in both cases**, or at least is not worse off.\n\nSo **(A0, A0)** is still a Nash equilibrium.\n\nEven if P2 is indifferent, they will choose A0 (since it doesn’t hurt).\n\nSo with C2, players still converge to (A0, A0) → payoff (15, 15)\n\n**As Player 1**, we go from 4 to **15** under C2 (vs 25 under C1).\n\nSo C1 is better for us.\n\nBut would we **approve** C2?\n\nOnly if we think it might win, or it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we are **Player 1**, and we **want to maximize our points**.\n\nNow, the key is: the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.\n\nSo we must think strategically: what is the **impact of our vote**?\n\nBut we are not told what others will vote.\n\nSo we must assume rational behavior, and **evaluate whether C1 or C2 is better for us**, and if approving them increases the chance of getting a better outcome.\n\nBut note: **C1 and C2 are both escrow-like contracts that shift incentives toward A0**.\n\nWe see that:\n- C1 leads to (25,25) → we get 25\n- C2 leads to (15,15) → we get 15\n\nSo **C1 is better for us**.\n\nNow, should we approve C1?\n\nYes — it gives us 25 instead of 4, and since it’s better, we **want it approved**.\n\nBut what if **drawing a lot of approvals for C1** makes it more likely to win?\n\nBut we are not restricted — we can approve both, or just one.\n\nBut the key is: **do we benefit from C2?**\n\nYes — we go from 4 to 15.\n\nBut we benefit **more** from C1 (25).\n\nSo overall, **we prefer C1 over C2**.\n\nNow, if we **approve only C1**, then:\n- C1 gets 1 approval (us)\n- C2 gets 0\n→ C1 wins (max approval is 1)\n\nWe get 25\n\nIf we **approve both**:\n- C1: 2 approvals\n- C2: 2 approvals\n→ both have max approval (2), so winner is chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance C1 (25 pts), 50% chance C2 (15 pts)\n\nExpected payoff: 0.5×25 + 0.5×15 = 12.5 + 7.5 = **20**\n\nBut if we **approve only C1**, we get **25** for sure.\n\nSo by approving both, we risk getting only 15 or 25 — expected only 20, which is **worse** than 25.\n\nSo we should **not approve C2** — because it **dilutes the chance** of C1 winning and introduces a risk of getting a worse contract.\n\nWhat if **Player 2 is more likely to approve C2**?\n\nWe don’t know — but we are only deciding our vote.\n\nWe assume **rational players**, so let’s think about **Player 2’s incentives**.\n\n### **Step 5: Player 2\'s Perspective**\n\nPlayer 2 wants to maximize their own payoff.\n\n#### Without any contract: (A1, A1) → (4,4)\n\nUnder C1:\n- If C1 is applied → (25,25) → Player 2 gets 25\n- So Player 2 benefits from C1\n\nUnder C2:\n- (15,15) → Player 2 gets 15\n\nSo Player 2 **strongly prefers C1** over C2 (25 vs 15)\n\nAnd since C1 is proposed by **Player 1**, Player 2 would want it to win.\n\nTherefore, **Player 2 will likely approve C1**, and may or may not approve C2.\n\nBut **C2 is worse** for Player 2 than C1, so they **will not approve C2** unless forced.\n\nIn fact, **Player 2 has no incentive to approve C2** — because:\n- It gives them less than C1\n- If they approve C2, but **C1 also has more approvals**, then C1 wins anyway\n- If they approve only C1, and we approve it, it wins\n- If they approve both, they might **harm** their own outcome by diluting C1\'s chance of winning\n\nSo **rational Player 2 will approve C1, and not C2**\n\nSo likely:\n- Player 2 approves C1 → 1 approval\n- We approve C1 → 2 approvals\n- C1 wins → we get 25\n\n(Why would we approve C2? It could reduce our expected payoff.)\n\nSuppose **we approve both**:\n- C1: 2 approvals\n- C2: 1 approval'

response:
Let's analyze the problem step by step to determine whether Player 1 should approve each contract. Our goal is to **maximize our own expected points**, considering the approval voting mechanism and the incentives of all players.

---

### **Step 1: Base Game Payoffs (No Contracts)**

The original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|           | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (6, 2)   | (4, 4)   |

- Player 2 has a **dominant strategy**: A1 (always gives better or equal payoff regardless of P1's action).
- Best response for P1:
  - If P2 → A0: P1 prefers A0 (10 > 6)
  - If P2 → A1: P1 prefers A1 (4 > 0)
- Unique Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → **(4, 4)**

So **without any contract**, we (Player 1) get **4 points**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand Contract Effects**

Both contracts add side payments **if a player chooses A0**:
- The player who picks A0 gets **+X** points.
- This +X is **paid entirely by the other player** (since "drawn equally from the other players" → with one other player, it's fully from them).
- If both play A0, each gets +X, each pays −X → net +X for each.
- If only one plays A0, they get +X, the other loses −X.
- A1 → no contract payment.

Thus, contract adjusts each payoff based on the player's own action, **independent of the opponent’s action**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

- If a player chooses A0 → gets +15 from contract
- A1 → no change

**Updated payoff matrix (with C1):**

|           | A0 (P2)       | A1 (P2)       |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (10+15=25, 10+15=25) → (25,25) | (0+15=15, 20−15=5) → (15,5) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (6−15=−9, 2+15=17) → (−9,17) | (4,4)           |

**Best responses:**

- **P1**:
  - P2 → A0: 25 (A0) vs −9 (A1) → prefers A0
  - P2 → A1: 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0
  → **A0 is dominant for P1**

- **P2**:
  - P1 → A0: 25 (A0) vs 5 (A1) → prefers A0
  - P1 → A1: 17 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0
  → **A0 is dominant for P2**

→ **(A0, A0)** is the unique Nash equilibrium under C1 → **we get 25 points**

**Conclusion**: C1 is **extremely beneficial** for us → we go from 4 to 25.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

- If a player chooses A0 → gets +5 from contract
- A1 → no change

**Updated payoff matrix (with C2):**

|           | A0 (P2)       | A1 (P2)       |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (10+5=15, 10+5=15) → (15,15) | (0+5=5, 20−5=15) → (5,15) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (6−5=1, 2+5=7) → (1,7)       | (4,4)           |

**Best responses:**

- **P1**:
  - P2 → A0: 15 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
  - P2 → A1: 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0
  → **A0 is dominant for P1**

- **P2**:
  - P1 → A0: 15 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → indifferent
  - P1 → A1: 7 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0
  → **Prefers A0** (or at least not worse)

→ **(A0, A0)** is still a Nash equilibrium → we get **15 points**

So C2 is **better than no contract** (15 > 4), but **much worse than C1** (25 > 15).

---

### **Step 5: Strategic Approval Decision**

We must decide: **Approve C1? Approve C2?**

The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

We are playing as **Player 1**. We can approve any subset.

Key strategic insights:

1. **C1 is best for us** (25 points) → we want to **maximize its chance of winning**
2. **C2 is worse for us** (15 points) → we **do not want it to win**
3. Approving C2 **only helps dilute support** for C1 unless C1 has more votes

Let’s evaluate possible scenarios:

#### Option A: Approve only C1
- C1: 1 approval (us)
- C2: 0 approvals
→ C1 has max approval (1) → **C1 wins with 100% chance**
→ We get **25 points**

#### Option B: Approve both C1 and C2
- C1: 2 approvals (us + ?, but we don't know Player 2’s vote)
- C2: 2 approvals (us + ?)

But now, we must predict **Player 2’s behavior**.

##### Player 2’s Incentives:
- Without contract: 4 points
- Under C1: 25 points → **big gain**
- Under C2: 15 points → also gain, but less

→ Player 2 **strongly prefers C1** over C2

→ Rational Player 2 will **approve C1**, and **not approve C2**, because:
- Approving C2 gives them less utility and **does not help C2 win** unless C1 fails
- If they approve only C1 and we approve C1, C1 wins
- If they approve both, they **risk diluting C1’s approval count and reducing its odds of winning**

So **rational Player 2 will approve only C1**

→ Therefore, in equilibrium:
- Player 2 approves C1 → 1 approval
- We approve C1 → 2 approvals
- C1 wins → we get 25

Now, **if we also approve C2**:
- C1: 2 approvals (us and P2)
- C2: 2 approvals (us only, P2 does not approve)
→ C1 and C2 both have max approval (2)
→ Winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% C1 (25 pts), 50% C2 (15 pts)
→ **Expected payoff: 0.5×25 + 0.5×15 = 20**

But **20 < 25** → **worse** for us than approving only C1

**Conclusion**: Approving C2 **reduces our expected payoff** from 25 to 20, even if we think Player 2 will also approve it.

Therefore, we should **not approve C2**

---

### **Final Decision:**

- **C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**: ✅ Approve — it leads to 25 points, and we can secure its win by approving it alone.
- **C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**: ❌ Do not approve — it reduces our expected payoff by introducing a 50% chance of getting only 15 points.

We only approve C1.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
Let’s carefully break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

The game is a simultaneous-move game between two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses an action: A0 or A1.

The payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:

|                | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

We are Player 1.

Our goal: maximize our **expected points**.

Without any contract, we analyze this as a strategic game. Let's consider if there’s a Nash equilibrium.

#### Best Responses:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1 gets 10 (if A0) vs 6 (if A1) → Best to play A0.
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1 gets 0 (if A0) vs 4 (if A1) → Best to play A1.

So Player 1's best response depends on Player 2’s action.

Now, for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1.
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1.

So, **Player 2 always prefers A1**, regardless of Player 1’s move.

Therefore, Player 2 will play A1.

Then, knowing Player 2 will play A1, Player 1’s best response is A1 (4 points) vs A0 (0 points). So Player 1 should play A1.

→ **Nash Equilibrium: (A1, A1)** → payoffs: (4, 4)

This is the rational outcome in the base game.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

The contract is proposed by Player 1 and requires **both players to sign** for it to take effect.

Contract:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive **+15 additional points**.
- These 15 points are **drawn equally from the other player** → so the other player loses 15 points.
- If a player chooses A1: **no additional payment** (in either direction).

So, the contract effectively:
- Imposes a **+15 to the player who chooses A0**, funded by the opponent.
- So, playing A0 increases your payoff by 15, but decreases the opponent’s by 15.
- Playing A1 has no extra effect.

**Important:** This is only active **if both players sign**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Contract from Player 1's Perspective**

We are considering whether to sign the contract.

So the contract becomes active **only if we sign it** and the other player also signs.

If **we do not sign**, the contract is not active → game proceeds as base game → outcome is (A1, A1), both get 4 points.

If **we sign**, then we are committing to the contract **only if the other player also signs**.

But since we are deciding whether to sign, we must consider: **Will the other player sign?**

The contract was proposed by Player 1 (you), and approval voting was used — so both players must approve.

So we must ask: **Would the other player sign the contract?**

Let’s analyze the incentives from Player 2’s perspective.

---

### **Step 4: Player 2's Incentive to Sign the Contract**

Let’s assume **Player 1 signs** the contract.

Player 2 now faces: should they sign?

If Player 2 **does not sign**, then contract is **not active**, game is base game → Player 2 will choose A1 (since it’s dominant), Player 1 will choose A1 → payoffs: (4,4)

If Player 2 **does sign**, then the contract is active.

Now, let’s analyze what happens in that case.

---

#### **Case: Contract is active (Both signed)**

The contract changes the payoffs as follows:

- If a player chooses A0 → +15 (from opponent)
- If a player chooses A1 → no effect

So we can now recalculate the **modified payoff matrix**.

Let’s build the new payoff matrix under the contract.

|                | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10+15, 10-15) = (25, -5) | (0+15, 20-15) = (15, 5) |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6-15, 2+15) = (-9, 17) | (4, 4)         |

Wait: let’s clarify the contract effect.

The contract says:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive +15, drawn equally from the other player.

So:
- Player 1 chooses A0 → gains +15, Player 2 loses 15
- Player 2 chooses A0 → gains +15, Player 1 loses 15

So **only the player who chooses A0 gets +15; the other loses 15.**

So payoffs are **not symmetric** in a simple way.

Let’s recast:

- (A0, A0): Player 1 gains 15 (from Player 2), Player 2 gains 15 (from Player 1) → both gain 15.

So payoff: (10 + 15, 10 + 15) = (25, 25)

- (A0, A1): Player 1 chooses A0 → +15, Player 2 chooses A1 → no extra
  But Player 2 is not choosing A0, so Player 1 does not get penalty.
  Player 1 gains 15 from the contract (because they played A0), and Player 2 loses 15.

Wait — no: the contract says: “If a player chooses A0, they receive +15, drawn equally from the other players.”

So it’s **per player**: if you choose A0, you get +15, and the other player loses 15.

So in (A0, A1):
- Player 1 chooses A0 → +15
- Player 2 chooses A1 → no effect
So Player 1 gets base +15, Player 2 gets base (20) - 15 = 5? Wait — no.

Wait: who gets the 15? Is it **from the other player**?

"drawn equally from the other players" — implies the cost is borne by the other player(s). Since there’s one other player, the 15 is taken from the other player.

So yes: if Player 1 plays A0, they gain +15, Player 2 loses 15 (in addition to whatever they get from base game).

Similarly, if Player 2 plays A0, they gain +15, Player 1 loses 15.

So let’s redo the full payoff matrix under contract:

|                | P2: A0               | P2: A1             |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **P1: A0**     | (10 +15, 10 -15) = (25, -5) | (0 +15, 20 -15) = (15, 5) |
| **P1: A1**     | (6 -15, 2 +15) = (-9, 17)   | (4, 4)             |

Wait — for (A1, A0):
- Player 1 plays A1 → no contract effect
- Player 2 plays A0 → Player 2 gets +15, Player 1 loses 15
So base payoffs are (6, 2), plus adjustment:
- P1: 6 - 15 = -9
- P2: 2 + 15 = 17 → yes, (-9, 17)

For (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → +15, P2 gets -15 → P1: 0+15=15, P2: 20–15=5 → (15,5)

For (A0, A0): both get +15 → (10+15, 10+15) = (25,25)

For (A1, A1): no A0 played → no contract effect → (4,4)

So full matrix under contract:

|                | P2: A0         | P2: A1       |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0**     | (25, -5)       | (15, 5)      |
| **P1: A1**     | (-9, 17)       | (4, 4)       |

Now, let’s analyze this new game.

---

### **Step 5: Nash Equilibrium Under Contract**

Let’s find best responses.

#### Player 1’s best responses:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 25 (A0) vs -9 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **Player 1 always prefers A0** under contract.

#### Player 2’s best responses:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets -5 (A0) vs 5 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 17 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So Player 2’s best response depends on P1.

But now, with Player 1 always playing A0, what should P2 do?

In the contract scenario, Player 1 will play A0 (since it's dominant for P1), so P2’s best response is A1.

So equilibrium is: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → outcome: (15, 5)

Player 1 gets 15 points, Player 2 gets 5.

But wait — is this stable?

Yes:
- P1: if P2 plays A1, P1 does best with A0 → 15
- P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 does best with A1 → 5

So (A0, A1) is Nash equilibrium.

Other possibilities:
- (A0, A0): P1 gets 25, but P2 gets -5 → P2 would rather play A1 → not stable
- (A1, A0): P1 gets -9, but P1 would rather play A0 → not stable
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 4, but P1 would prefer A0 (15) → not stable

So **only stable equilibrium is (A0, A1)** → payoffs (15, 5)

So under contract, **if both sign**, the outcome is **(A0, A1)** → Player 1 gets **15**, Player 2 gets **5**

---

### **Step 6: Would Player 2 Want to Sign the Contract?**

Now, go back to Player 2’s decision: **Would they sign the contract?**

We are Player 1, considering signing. But for the contract to activate, **both must sign**.

So we must ask: **Will Player 2 sign?**

If Player 2 knows that **if they sign, then the outcome will be (A0, A1) → they get 5 points**, compared to **if they don’t sign**, the base game outcome is (A1, A1) → they get 4 points.

So:
- If Player 2 signs → they get **5**
- If Player 2 does NOT sign → contract inactive → outcome is base game: (A1, A1), they get **4**

So **Player 2 gains 1 point** by signing.

Therefore, **Player 2 will sign the contract** — it benefits them.

So both players signing leads to outcome (A0, A1), Player 1 gets 15, Player 2 gets 5.

---

### **Step 7: Is Signing Beneficial for Player 1?**

Compare:
- **If Player 1 signs the contract** → contract activates (since P2 will sign) → outcome (A0, A1) → Player 1 gets **15**
- **If Player 1 does not sign** → contract not active → base game → outcome (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets **4**

So 15 > 4 → **Player 1 gains** by signing.

Therefore, **signing is strictly better**.

---

### **Step 8: Is There Any Risk?**

Could Player 2 refuse to sign?

We just showed that **Player 2 benefits from signing** (5 > 4), so they will sign.

So no risk — the contract will activate, and outcome is (A0, A1) → good for Player 1.

Even though Player 1 is getting more than they would get in base game, and Player 2 is also better off (5 > 4), so it’s a win-win in the contract case.

Hence, **signing is beneficial and safe**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the original game without contract

Original payoffs for me (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): 10 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points  
- (A1, A0): 6 points
- (A1, A1): 4 points

Let me find the best responses:
- **For the other player:** If I play A0, they get 10 from A0 vs 20 from A1 (prefer A1). If I play A1, they get 2 from A0 vs 4 from A1 (prefer A1). **A1 is their dominant strategy.**
- **For me:** Given they play A1 (dominant), I get 0 from A0 vs 4 from A1 (prefer A1).

**Without contract equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze the game with contract

The contract adds:
- +10 points to whoever plays A0 (taken from the other player)
- No payment for A1

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 (I get for A0) - 10 (I pay for their A0) = **10 points**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 10 (I get for A0) = **10 points**
- (A1, A0): 6 - 10 (I pay for their A0) = **-4 points**
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 = **4 points**

Modified payoffs for other player:
- (A0, A0): 10 points
- (A0, A1): 10 points
- (A1, A0): 12 points
- (A1, A1): 4 points

Best responses with contract:
- **For me:** A0 dominates A1 (I get 10 regardless of their choice vs max 4 from A1)
- **For them:** If I play A0, they're indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give 10)

**With contract equilibrium: (A0, A0) or (A0, A1) → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** 4 points (expected)
- **With contract:** 10 points (expected)

The contract increases my expected payoff from 4 to 10 points, and also benefits the other player (from 4 to 10 points), so both players have incentive to sign.

response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate modified payoffs with the contract

Original payoffs (me as Player 2, other as Player 1):
- (My A0, Other A0): I get 10, Other gets 10
- (My A1, Other A0): I get 20, Other gets 0  
- (My A0, Other A1): I get 2, Other gets 6
- (My A1, Other A1): I get 4, Other gets 4

With contract (A1 costs 10 points paid to the other player):
- (A0, A0): I get 10, Other gets 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20-10=**10**, Other gets 0+10=**10**
- (A0, A1): I get 2+10=**12**, Other gets 6-10=**-4**
- (A1, A1): I get 4-10+10=**4**, Other gets 4-10+10=**4**

## Step 2: Analyze from my perspective (Player 2)

If Player 1 chooses A0:
- I get 10 from A0, or 10 from A1 → **Indifferent**

If Player 1 chooses A1:
- I get 12 from A0, or 4 from A1 → **A0 is strictly better**

So A0 weakly dominates A1 for me.

## Step 3: Analyze from Player 1's perspective

If I choose A0:
- Player 1 gets 10 from A0, or -4 from A1 → **A0 is strictly better**

If I choose A1:
- Player 1 gets 10 from A0, or 4 from A1 → **A0 is strictly better**

So A0 strictly dominates A1 for Player 1. A rational Player 1 will always play A0.

## Step 4: Determine optimal strategy

Given that Player 1 will rationally play A0:
- Playing A0 gives me 10 points
- Playing A1 gives me 10 points

While I'm indifferent when Player 1 plays A0, playing A0 protects me if Player 1 deviates (I get 12 vs 4). There's no downside to playing A0.

The contract successfully transforms the game to achieve the cooperative outcome (A0, A0) with payoffs (10, 10).

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses an action: A0 or A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, then Player 2's):

|               | P2: A0   | P2: A1   |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **P1: A0**    | (10, 10) | (0, 20)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (6, 2)   | (4, 4)   |

We are Player 1.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Best Responses and Nash Equilibria**

Let’s understand the strategic incentives.

#### **If P2 plays A0**:
- P1 gets 10 for A0, 6 for A1 → prefers A0

#### **If P2 plays A1**:
- P1 gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So P1 has no dominant strategy.

Similarly for P2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 for A0, 20 for A1 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So **P2 always prefers A1**, no matter what P1 does. Thus, **A1 is a dominant strategy for P2**.

Therefore, rational P2 will play A1.

Then P1, knowing P2 plays A1:
- A0 gives 0
- A1 gives 4
→ So P1 will play A1.

**So the unique Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1)** → each gets 4 points.

But wait — could there be a better outcome? Yes! (A0, A0) gives both 10 — but it's unstable, since P2 has incentive to deviate (they get 20 instead of 10 if they play A1 when P1 plays A0).

So without a contract, the outcome is (A1, A1), with payoff (4, 4).

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

A **contract** modifies payoffs by adding **transfer payments** based on actions.

Two contracts are proposed:

---

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

- If a player chooses **A0**, they receive an **additional 15 points**, **drawn equally from the other player**.
- If a player chooses **A1**, no additional payments.

So: This is a **subsidy to A0**. The player who picks A0 gets +15, and the other player loses 15.

But note: **“drawn equally from the other players”**. Since there’s only one other player, the **entire 15 goes from the other player to the A0 chooser**.

So:
- If P1 plays A0, P2 pays P1 15 → P1 gets 15 extra, P2 loses 15
- If P2 plays A0, P1 pays P2 15 → P2 gets 15 extra, P1 loses 15

This effectively **adds a 15-point transfer from the non-A0 player to the A0 player**.

Let’s now update the payoffs under C1.

We compute the **total payoff to P1** in each case.

---

#### **C1 Expanded Payoff Matrix (P1's total payoff)**

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (+15 to P2, -15 from P1) | A1 (no change) |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **A0** | 10 + 15 = **25** (P1 gets 15, P2 loses 15) | 0 + 15 = **15** (P1 gets 15) |
| **A1** | 6 - 15 = **-9** (P1 loses 15) | 4 (no change) |

Wait — careful:

When P1 plays A0:
- P1 gets 15 from the contract (since P1 played A0)
- But if P2 plays A0, then **P1 must pay 15 to P2**, because P2 played A0 → P1 pays 15.
  - So total for P1: base payoff + (15 from P1’s A0) – (15 to P2 because P2 played A0)

Let’s define the **total payoff to P1** under C1.

For any outcome:

- P1 receives +15 **only if P1 plays A0**
- P1 pays 15 **only if P2 plays A0** (because P2 played A0 → P1 must pay 15 to P2)

So:
- If (A0, A0): P1 gets 10 (base) + 15 (for A0) - 15 (because P2 played A0) = **10**
- If (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 (base) + 15 (A0) - 0 (P2 didn’t play A0) = **15**
- If (A1, A0): P1 gets 6 (base) -15 (because P2 played A0) + 0 (P1 didn’t play A0) = **-9**
- If (A1, A1): P1 gets 4 (base) + 0 = **4**

Wait — but **if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0**, then both get +15 from contract? But the wording says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15... drawn equally from the other players."

So if **both** play A0:
- P1 gets +15 (because P1 played A0)
- But pays 15 to P2 (because P2 played A0)
→ Net change: 0
- Similarly, P2 gets +15 from playing A0, pays 15 to P1 → net 0

So the net **contract** effect is zero when both play A0.

But if **only P1 plays A0**, then:
- P1 gets +15
- P2 pays 0 (P2 didn’t play A0) → P1 keeps +15

If **only P2 plays A0**, P2 gets +15, P1 pays 15.

So corrected contract rules:

For **P1**:
- Gain +15 **if P1 plays A0**
- Loss -15 **if P2 plays A0**

So total P1 payoff under C1:

| P1\P2 | A0                | A1                |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| A0    | 10 (base) +15 -15 = **10** | 0 +15 = **15** |
| A1    | 6 -15 = **-9**     | 4 +0 = **4**      |

Wait — when P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0:
- P1 did **not** play A0 → no +15
- But P2 **played** A0 → so P1 must pay 15 → so P1 gets 6 -15 = -9

Yes.

So now, under C1, P1's payoffs:

- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 15
- (A1, A0): -9
- (A1, A1): 4

Now, what is P1's best response?

If P2 plays A0:
- P1 gets 10 (A0) vs -9 (A1) → prefers A0

If P2 plays A1:
- P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is a dominant strategy for P1 under C1**!

Now, what about P2?

P2’s perspective (under C1):

P2 gets:
- +15 if P2 plays A0
- -15 if P1 plays A0

So P2's payoffs:

| P1\P2 | A0                  | A1                 |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------|
| A0    | 10 (base) +15 -15 = 10 | 0 +15 = 15         |
| A1    | 2 -15 = -13         | 4                  |

So P2’s payoff:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 10 (A0) vs -13 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P2 also has a dominant strategy to play A0 under C1!**

Thus, under C1, **both players play A0**, leading to outcome (A0, A0).

Total payoff:
- P1: 10
- P2: 10

But we must check: what does each receive?

- Base payoff for (A0, A0): 10 each
- Contract: both played A0 → each gets +15 (from their own A0), but pays 15 to the other → net contract effect: 0
→ So final payoffs: (10, 10)

Wait! But earlier I said P1 gets 10 (base) +15 (A0) -15 (P2 played A0) = 10 → yes.

So even though the contract transfers money, net effect is zero when both play A0.

So outcome: (A0, A0) → (10,10) in payoffs.

But P1 now gets **10**, instead of 4 (in original NE).

**So C1 improves P1’s payoff from 4 to 10.**

But is this stable under contracts? Yes — both play A0, mutual best response.

Also, **P2 also prefers A0** in equilibrium → so if both are rational, they will play (A0, A0).

So **C1 leads to outcome (A0, A0)** → P1 gets 10.

Thus, **C1 is good for P1**.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

- If a player chooses A0: no additional payments
- If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So: only A1 players pay 5 → paid to others.

Since only one other player, **if a player plays A1, they lose 5**, and the other player gains 5.

So:
- If P1 plays A1: P1 loses 5, P2 gains 5
- If P2 plays A1: P2 loses 5, P1 gains 5

No payment if A0.

Let’s compute P1’s total payoff under C2.

| P1\P2 | A0                 | A1                  |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------|
| A0    | 10 (base) +0       | 0 +0                |
| A1    | 6 -5 = 1           | 4 -5 = -1           |

Wait:

- If (A0, A0): both get 0 net from contract → (10,10)
- If (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → P2 loses 5 → P1 gains 5 → so P1 gets 0 +5 = 5
- If (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → P1 loses 5 → P2 gains 5 → P1 gets 6 -5 = 1
- If (A1, A1): both play A1 → each loses 5, but each gains 5 from the other → net 0 → so payoffs remain (4,4)

So final payoffs for P1 under C2:

| P1\P2 | A0        | A1        |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A0    | 10        | 5         |
| A1    | 1         | 4         |

So what is P1’s best response?

If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0

If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant strategy for P1** under C2 too!

Now check P2:

P2’s payoffs:

| P1\P2 | A0        | A1        |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A0    | 10        | 2 +5 = 7  |
| A1    | -5 + 5 = 0| 4         |

Wait:

- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → loses 5 → but P1 plays A0 → no payment from P1 → so P2 loses 5 → base 2 → total -3? Wait — inconsistency.

Let’s redefine carefully.

Under C2:

- If P2 plays A1: P2 pays 5 → so lost 5
- If P1 plays A1: P1 pays 5 → P2 gains 5

So:

- (A0, A0): P1 plays A0 (no cost), P2 plays A0 (no cost) → base payoffs: (10,10)
- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → loses 5 → gets 2 -5 = -3; P1 plays A0 → no cost → gets 0 → no gain
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → loses 5 → gets 6 -5 = 1; P2 plays A0 → no cost → gets 2
- (A1, A1): both lose 5, but each gains 5 from other → net 0 → game payoffs: (4,4)

So corrected P2's payoff:

| P1\P2 | A0        | A1        |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A0    | 10        | -3        |
| A1    | 2         | 4         |

So P2’s best response:

If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 for A0, -3 for A1 → prefers A0

If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So P2 does **not** have a dominant strategy.

Now, back to equilibrium:

P1 has dominant strategy: always play A0.

So P1 will play A0.

Then P2, seeing P1 plays A0, will choose best response: A0 (gets 10) vs A1 (-3) → prefers A0

So **(A0, A0)** is the unique equilibrium under C2.

Final payoffs: (10,10)

So P1 gets **10 points**.

Same as under C1.

---

### **Step 4: Compare Contracts for P1**

- **Without contract**: (A1, A1) → P1 gets 4
- **Under C1**: (A0, A0) → P1 gets 10
- **Under C2**: (A0, A0) → P1 gets 10

So both contracts improve P1’s payoff from 4 to 10.

But **we must decide which contracts to approve**.

The **winning contract** is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So we need to think: if we approve both, and the other player approves C1, then C1 wins (because approvals >=2, might be more than C2)

But we cannot know what the other player will do.

But here's the key: **we are Player 1**, and we are deciding **which contracts to approve**, knowing that:

- The contract is selected **only if it gets maximum approvals**
- We want to **maximize our expected payoff**, because the winner is chosen uniformly at random from the set with max approvals.

So we must consider **strategic approval behavior**.

But the twist is: we only control our own approvals.

And the question is: **should we approve C1? C2?**

Both give us 10.

But perhaps one is more likely to win, or safer.

But we don't know the other player’s preferences.

But we can **assume rationality** — but the other player might not be us.

Let’s think about **what the other player (P2)** might prefer.

---

### **Step 5: What does the other player (P2) prefer?**

Let’s evaluate P2’s payoff under C1 and C2.

#### **C1 (Player 1’s proposal)**

From earlier:
- (A0, A0): P2 gets 10 (base) +15 (A0) -15 (P1 played A0) = 10
- (A0, A1): P2 gets 0 (base) +15 -0 = 15
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 2 +15 -15 = 2
- (A1, A1): 4

But earlier we found that under C1, **both players play A0** → so outcome is (A0, A0) → P2 gets 10.

But is that really P2’s best interest?

Could P2 do better?

Under C1, earlier calculation showed:

P2’s best responses: both A0 is best regardless of P1 → so yes, (A0, A0) is equilibrium.

P2 gets 10.

But **under the contract**, could P2 have desired a different outcome?

Note: P2 **did not propose** the contract — P1 did.

And **P2 gets only 10** under C1.

But **originally**, P2 got 4 in (A1, A1), so 10 is better.

Wait — but P1 gets 10 too — so P2 is fine.

But let’s consider: **if P2 had a different goal**, could they prefer otherwise?

But assuming P2 is rational and wants to maximize own payoff.

Under C1, P2 gets

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry


Your previous response was:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses an action: A0 or A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, then Player 2's):

|               | P2: A0   | P2: A1   |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **P1: A0**    | (10, 10) | (0, 20)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (6, 2)   | (4, 4)   |

We are Player 1.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Best Responses and Nash Equilibria**

Let’s understand the strategic incentives.

#### **If P2 plays A0**:
- P1 gets 10 for A0, 6 for A1 → prefers A0

#### **If P2 plays A1**:
- P1 gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So P1 has no dominant strategy.

Similarly for P2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 for A0, 20 for A1 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So **P2 always prefers A1**, no matter what P1 does. Thus, **A1 is a dominant strategy for P2**.

Therefore, rational P2 will play A1.

Then P1, knowing P2 plays A1:
- A0 gives 0
- A1 gives 4
→ So P1 will play A1.

**So the unique Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1)** → each gets 4 points.

But wait — could there be a better outcome? Yes! (A0, A0) gives both 10 — but it's unstable, since P2 has incentive to deviate (they get 20 instead of 10 if they play A1 when P1 plays A0).

So without a contract, the outcome is (A1, A1), with payoff (4, 4).

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

A **contract** modifies payoffs by adding **transfer payments** based on actions.

Two contracts are proposed:

---

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

- If a player chooses **A0**, they receive an **additional 15 points**, **drawn equally from the other player**.
- If a player chooses **A1**, no additional payments.

So: This is a **subsidy to A0**. The player who picks A0 gets +15, and the other player loses 15.

But note: **“drawn equally from the other players”**. Since there’s only one other player, the **entire 15 goes from the other player to the A0 chooser**.

So:
- If P1 plays A0, P2 pays P1 15 → P1 gets 15 extra, P2 loses 15
- If P2 plays A0, P1 pays P2 15 → P2 gets 15 extra, P1 loses 15

This effectively **adds a 15-point transfer from the non-A0 player to the A0 player**.

Let’s now update the payoffs under C1.

We compute the **total payoff to P1** in each case.

---

#### **C1 Expanded Payoff Matrix (P1's total payoff)**

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (+15 to P2, -15 from P1) | A1 (no change) |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **A0** | 10 + 15 = **25** (P1 gets 15, P2 loses 15) | 0 + 15 = **15** (P1 gets 15) |
| **A1** | 6 - 15 = **-9** (P1 loses 15) | 4 (no change) |

Wait — careful:

When P1 plays A0:
- P1 gets 15 from the contract (since P1 played A0)
- But if P2 plays A0, then **P1 must pay 15 to P2**, because P2 played A0 → P1 pays 15.
  - So total for P1: base payoff + (15 from P1’s A0) – (15 to P2 because P2 played A0)

Let’s define the **total payoff to P1** under C1.

For any outcome:

- P1 receives +15 **only if P1 plays A0**
- P1 pays 15 **only if P2 plays A0** (because P2 played A0 → P1 must pay 15 to P2)

So:
- If (A0, A0): P1 gets 10 (base) + 15 (for A0) - 15 (because P2 played A0) = **10**
- If (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 (base) + 15 (A0) - 0 (P2 didn’t play A0) = **15**
- If (A1, A0): P1 gets 6 (base) -15 (because P2 played A0) + 0 (P1 didn’t play A0) = **-9**
- If (A1, A1): P1 gets 4 (base) + 0 = **4**

Wait — but **if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0**, then both get +15 from contract? But the wording says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15... drawn equally from the other players."

So if **both** play A0:
- P1 gets +15 (because P1 played A0)
- But pays 15 to P2 (because P2 played A0)
→ Net change: 0
- Similarly, P2 gets +15 from playing A0, pays 15 to P1 → net 0

So the net **contract** effect is zero when both play A0.

But if **only P1 plays A0**, then:
- P1 gets +15
- P2 pays 0 (P2 didn’t play A0) → P1 keeps +15

If **only P2 plays A0**, P2 gets +15, P1 pays 15.

So corrected contract rules:

For **P1**:
- Gain +15 **if P1 plays A0**
- Loss -15 **if P2 plays A0**

So total P1 payoff under C1:

| P1\P2 | A0                | A1                |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| A0    | 10 (base) +15 -15 = **10** | 0 +15 = **15** |
| A1    | 6 -15 = **-9**     | 4 +0 = **4**      |

Wait — when P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0:
- P1 did **not** play A0 → no +15
- But P2 **played** A0 → so P1 must pay 15 → so P1 gets 6 -15 = -9

Yes.

So now, under C1, P1's payoffs:

- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 15
- (A1, A0): -9
- (A1, A1): 4

Now, what is P1's best response?

If P2 plays A0:
- P1 gets 10 (A0) vs -9 (A1) → prefers A0

If P2 plays A1:
- P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is a dominant strategy for P1 under C1**!

Now, what about P2?

P2’s perspective (under C1):

P2 gets:
- +15 if P2 plays A0
- -15 if P1 plays A0

So P2's payoffs:

| P1\P2 | A0                  | A1                 |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------|
| A0    | 10 (base) +15 -15 = 10 | 0 +15 = 15         |
| A1    | 2 -15 = -13         | 4                  |

So P2’s payoff:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 10 (A0) vs -13 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P2 also has a dominant strategy to play A0 under C1!**

Thus, under C1, **both players play A0**, leading to outcome (A0, A0).

Total payoff:
- P1: 10
- P2: 10

But we must check: what does each receive?

- Base payoff for (A0, A0): 10 each
- Contract: both played A0 → each gets +15 (from their own A0), but pays 15 to the other → net contract effect: 0
→ So final payoffs: (10, 10)

Wait! But earlier I said P1 gets 10 (base) +15 (A0) -15 (P2 played A0) = 10 → yes.

So even though the contract transfers money, net effect is zero when both play A0.

So outcome: (A0, A0) → (10,10) in payoffs.

But P1 now gets **10**, instead of 4 (in original NE).

**So C1 improves P1’s payoff from 4 to 10.**

But is this stable under contracts? Yes — both play A0, mutual best response.

Also, **P2 also prefers A0** in equilibrium → so if both are rational, they will play (A0, A0).

So **C1 leads to outcome (A0, A0)** → P1 gets 10.

Thus, **C1 is good for P1**.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

- If a player chooses A0: no additional payments
- If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So: only A1 players pay 5 → paid to others.

Since only one other player, **if a player plays A1, they lose 5**, and the other player gains 5.

So:
- If P1 plays A1: P1 loses 5, P2 gains 5
- If P2 plays A1: P2 loses 5, P1 gains 5

No payment if A0.

Let’s compute P1’s total payoff under C2.

| P1\P2 | A0                 | A1                  |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------|
| A0    | 10 (base) +0       | 0 +0                |
| A1    | 6 -5 = 1           | 4 -5 = -1           |

Wait:

- If (A0, A0): both get 0 net from contract → (10,10)
- If (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → P2 loses 5 → P1 gains 5 → so P1 gets 0 +5 = 5
- If (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → P1 loses 5 → P2 gains 5 → P1 gets 6 -5 = 1
- If (A1, A1): both play A1 → each loses 5, but each gains 5 from the other → net 0 → so payoffs remain (4,4)

So final payoffs for P1 under C2:

| P1\P2 | A0        | A1        |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A0    | 10        | 5         |
| A1    | 1         | 4         |

So what is P1’s best response?

If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0

If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant strategy for P1** under C2 too!

Now check P2:

P2’s payoffs:

| P1\P2 | A0        | A1        |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A0    | 10        | 2 +5 = 7  |
| A1    | -5 + 5 = 0| 4         |

Wait:

- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → loses 5 → but P1 plays A0 → no payment from P1 → so P2 loses 5 → base 2 → total -3? Wait — inconsistency.

Let’s redefine carefully.

Under C2:

- If P2 plays A1: P2 pays 5 → so lost 5
- If P1 plays A1: P1 pays 5 → P2 gains 5

So:

- (A0, A0): P1 plays A0 (no cost), P2 plays A0 (no cost) → base payoffs: (10,10)
- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → loses 5 → gets 2 -5 = -3; P1 plays A0 → no cost → gets 0 → no gain
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → loses 5 → gets 6 -5 = 1; P2 plays A0 → no cost → gets 2
- (A1, A1): both lose 5, but each gains 5 from other → net 0 → game payoffs: (4,4)

So corrected P2's payoff:

| P1\P2 | A0        | A1        |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A0    | 10        | -3        |
| A1    | 2         | 4         |

So P2’s best response:

If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 for A0, -3 for A1 → prefers A0

If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So P2 does **not** have a dominant strategy.

Now, back to equilibrium:

P1 has dominant strategy: always play A0.

So P1 will play A0.

Then P2, seeing P1 plays A0, will choose best response: A0 (gets 10) vs A1 (-3) → prefers A0

So **(A0, A0)** is the unique equilibrium under C2.

Final payoffs: (10,10)

So P1 gets **10 points**.

Same as under C1.

---

### **Step 4: Compare Contracts for P1**

- **Without contract**: (A1, A1) → P1 gets 4
- **Under C1**: (A0, A0) → P1 gets 10
- **Under C2**: (A0, A0) → P1 gets 10

So both contracts improve P1’s payoff from 4 to 10.

But **we must decide which contracts to approve**.

The **winning contract** is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So we need to think: if we approve both, and the other player approves C1, then C1 wins (because approvals >=2, might be more than C2)

But we cannot know what the other player will do.

But here's the key: **we are Player 1**, and we are deciding **which contracts to approve**, knowing that:

- The contract is selected **only if it gets maximum approvals**
- We want to **maximize our expected payoff**, because the winner is chosen uniformly at random from the set with max approvals.

So we must consider **strategic approval behavior**.

But the twist is: we only control our own approvals.

And the question is: **should we approve C1? C2?**

Both give us 10.

But perhaps one is more likely to win, or safer.

But we don't know the other player’s preferences.

But we can **assume rationality** — but the other player might not be us.

Let’s think about **what the other player (P2)** might prefer.

---

### **Step 5: What does the other player (P2) prefer?**

Let’s evaluate P2’s payoff under C1 and C2.

#### **C1 (Player 1’s proposal)**

From earlier:
- (A0, A0): P2 gets 10 (base) +15 (A0) -15 (P1 played A0) = 10
- (A0, A1): P2 gets 0 (base) +15 -0 = 15
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 2 +15 -15 = 2
- (A1, A1): 4

But earlier we found that under C1, **both players play A0** → so outcome is (A0, A0) → P2 gets 10.

But is that really P2’s best interest?

Could P2 do better?

Under C1, earlier calculation showed:

P2’s best responses: both A0 is best regardless of P1 → so yes, (A0, A0) is equilibrium.

P2 gets 10.

But **under the contract**, could P2 have desired a different outcome?

Note: P2 **did not propose** the contract — P1 did.

And **P2 gets only 10** under C1.

But **originally**, P2 got 4 in (A1, A1), so 10 is better.

Wait — but P1 gets 10 too — so P2 is fine.

But let’s consider: **if P2 had a different goal**, could they prefer otherwise?

But assuming P2 is rational and wants to maximize own payoff.

Under C1, P2 gets

Thus, **A1 is a dominant strategy for P2**.\n\nTherefore, rational P2 will play A1.\n\nThen P1, knowing P2 plays A1:\n- A0 gives 0\n- A1 gives 4\n→ So P1 will play A1.\n\n**So the unique Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1)** → each gets 4 points.\n\nBut wait — could there be a better outcome? Yes! (A0, A0) gives both 10 — but it\'s unstable, since P2 has incentive to deviate (they get 20 instead of 10 if they play A1 when P1 plays A0).\n\nSo without a contract, the outcome is (A1, A1), with payoff (4, 4).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Understand the Contract Mechanism**\n\nA **contract** modifies payoffs by adding **transfer payments** based on actions.\n\nTwo contracts are proposed:\n\n---\n\n#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**\n\n- If a player chooses **A0**, they receive an **additional 15 points**, **drawn equally from the other player**.\n- If a player chooses **A1**, no additional payments.\n\nSo: This is a **subsidy to A0**. The player who picks A0 gets +15, and the other player loses 15.\n\nBut note: **“drawn equally from the other players”**. Since there’s only one other player, the **entire 15 goes from the other player to the A0 chooser**.\n\nSo:\n- If P1 plays A0, P2 pays P1 15 → P1 gets 15 extra, P2 loses 15\n- If P2 plays A0, P1 pays P2 15 → P2 gets 15 extra, P1 loses 15\n\nThis effectively **adds a 15-point transfer from the non-A0 player to the A0 player**.\n\nLet’s now update the payoffs under C1.\n\nWe compute the **total payoff to P1** in each case.\n\n---\n\n#### **C1 Expanded Payoff Matrix (P1\'s total payoff)**\n\n| P1 \\ P2 | A0 (+15 to P2, -15 from P1) | A1 (no change) |\n|--------|-------------------------------|----------------|\n| **A0** | 10 + 15 = **25** (P1 gets 15, P2 loses 15) | 0 + 15 = **15** (P1 gets 15) |\n| **A1** | 6 - 15 = **-9** (P1 loses 15) | 4 (no change) |\n\nWait — careful:\n\nWhen P1 plays A0:\n- P1 gets 15 from the contract (since P1 played A0)\n- But if P2 plays A0, then **P1 must pay 15 to P2**, because P2 played A0 → P1 pays 15.\n  - So total for P1: base payoff + (15 from P1’s A0) – (15 to P2 because P2 played A0)\n\nLet’s define the **total payoff to P1** under C1.\n\nFor any outcome:\n\n- P1 receives +15 **only if P1 plays A0**\n- P1 pays 15 **only if P2 plays A0** (because P2 played A0 → P1 must pay 15 to P2)\n\nSo:\n- If (A0, A0): P1 gets 10 (base) + 15 (for A0) - 15 (because P2 played A0) = **10**\n- If (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 (base) + 15 (A0) - 0 (P2 didn’t play A0) = **15**\n- If (A1, A0): P1 gets 6 (base) -15 (because P2 played A0) + 0 (P1 didn’t play A0) = **-9**\n- If (A1, A1): P1 gets 4 (base) + 0 = **4**\n\nWait — but **if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0**, then both get +15 from contract? But the wording says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15... drawn equally from the other players."\n\nSo if **both** play A0:\n- P1 gets +15 (because P1 played A0)\n- But pays 15 to P2 (because P2 played A0)\n→ Net change: 0\n- Similarly, P2 gets +15 from playing A0, pays 15 to P1 → net 0\n\nSo the net **contract** effect is zero when both play A0.\n\nBut if **only P1 plays A0**, then:\n- P1 gets +15\n- P2 pays 0 (P2 didn’t play A0) → P1 keeps +15\n\nIf **only P2 plays A0**, P2 gets +15, P1 pays 15.\n\nSo corrected contract rules:\n\nFor **P1**:\n- Gain +15 **if P1 plays A0**\n- Loss -15 **if P2 plays A0**\n\nSo total P1 payoff under C1:\n\n| P1\\P2 | A0                | A1                |\n|-------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| A0    | 10 (base) +15 -15 = **10** | 0 +15 = **15** |\n| A1    | 6 -15 = **-9**     | 4 +0 = **4**      |\n\nWait — when P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0:\n- P1 did **not** play A0 → no +15\n- But P2 **played** A0 → so P1 must pay 15 → so P1 gets 6 -15 = -9\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, under C1, P1\'s payoffs:\n\n- (A0, A0): 10\n- (A0, A1): 15\n- (A1, A0): -9\n- (A1, A1): 4\n\nNow, what is P1\'s best response?\n\nIf P2 plays A0:\n- P1 gets 10 (A0) vs -9 (A1) → prefers A0\n\nIf P2 plays A1:\n- P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0\n\nSo **A0 is a dominant strategy for P1 under C1**!\n\nNow, what about P2?\n\nP2’s perspective (under C1):\n\nP2 gets:\n- +15 if P2 plays A0\n- -15 if P1 plays A0\n\nSo P2\'s payoffs:\n\n| P1\\P2 | A0                  | A1                 |\n|-------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| A0    | 10 (base) +15 -15 = 10 | 0 +15 = 15         |\n| A1    | 2 -15 = -13         | 4                  |\n\nSo P2’s payoff:\n\n- If P1 plays A0:\n  - P2 gets 10 (A0) vs -13 (A1) → prefers A0\n- If P1 plays A1:\n  - P2 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0\n\nSo **P2 also has a dominant strategy to play A0 under C1!**\n\nThus, under C1, **both players play A0**, leading to outcome (A0, A0).\n\nTotal payoff:\n- P1: 10\n- P2: 10\n\nBut we must check: what does each receive?\n\n- Base payoff for (A0, A0): 10 each\n- Contract: both played A0 → each gets +15 (from their own A0), but pays 15 to the other → net contract effect: 0\n→ So final payoffs: (10, 10)\n\nWait! But earlier I said P1 gets 10 (base) +15 (A0) -15 (P2 played A0) = 10 → yes.\n\nSo even though the contract transfers money, net effect is zero when both play A0.\n\nSo outcome: (A0, A0) → (10,10) in payoffs.\n\nBut P1 now gets **10**, instead of 4 (in original NE).\n\n**So C1 improves P1’s payoff from 4 to 10.**\n\nBut is this stable under contracts? Yes — both play A0, mutual best response.\n\nAlso, **P2 also prefers A0** in equilibrium → so if both are rational, they will play (A0, A0).\n\nSo **C1 leads to outcome (A0, A0)** → P1 gets 10.\n\nThus, **C1 is good for P1**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**\n\n- If a player chooses A0: no additional payments\n- If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.\n\nSo: only A1 players pay 5 → paid to others.\n\nSince only one other player, **if a player plays A1, they lose 5**, and the other player gains 5.\n\nSo:\n- If P1 plays A1: P1 loses 5, P2 gains 5\n- If P2 plays A1: P2 loses 5, P1 gains 5\n\nNo payment if A0.\n\nLet’s compute P1’s total payoff under C2.\n\n| P1\\P2 | A0                 | A1                  |\n|-------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| A0    | 10 (base) +0       | 0 +0                |\n| A1    | 6 -5 = 1           | 4 -5 = -1           |\n\nWait:\n\n- If (A0, A0): both get 0 net from contract → (10,10)\n- If (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → P2 loses 5 → P1 gains 5 → so P1 gets 0 +5 = 5\n- If (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → P1 loses 5 → P2 gains 5 → P1 gets 6 -5 = 1\n- If (A1, A1): both play A1 → each loses 5, but each gains 5 from the other → net 0 → so payoffs remain (4,4)\n\nSo final payoffs for P1 under C2:\n\n| P1\\P2 | A0        | A1        |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| A0    | 10        | 5         |\n| A1    | 1         | 4         |\n\nSo what is P1’s best response?\n\nIf P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0\n\nIf P2 plays A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0\n\nSo **A0 is dominant strategy for P1** under C2 too!\n\nNow check P2:\n\nP2’s payoffs:\n\n| P1\\P2 | A0        | A1        |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| A0    | 10        | 2 +5 = 7  |\n| A1    | -5 + 5 = 0| 4         |\n\nWait:\n\n- (A0, A0): 10\n- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → loses 5 → but P1 plays A0 → no payment from P1 → so P2 loses 5 → base 2 → total -3?

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether Player 1 should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

The game is a simultaneous move two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Payoff | Opponent's Payoff |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 10          | 10                |
| A0          | A1                | 0           | 20                |
| A1          | A0                | 6           | 2                 |
| A1          | A1                | 4           | 4                 |

This is a coordination-like game, but not symmetric in payoffs. Let's analyze the incentives.

#### Best responses:

- If you believe opponent plays A0:
  - You get 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefer **A0**
- If you believe opponent plays A1:
  - You get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer **A1**

So your best response depends on your belief about the opponent’s choice. This suggests there could be multiple equilibria.

But now we must consider the **contract**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

The contract says:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other players.

Key implications:
- If you choose A0, you get **+15** points (from some fund, presumably taken from the other player).
- If you choose A1, no additional payment.
- The **cost of the +15** for choosing A0 is **borne by the opponent**, meaning they lose 15 points if you play A0.
- But the contract only activates if **both players sign it**.

Important: The contract is **not automatically active** — it requires **consensus**. We are asked whether **Player 1** should sign it.

Assumption: The contract is proposed by Player 1, but **only becomes active if both players sign**.

So, signing means: “I agree that if I choose A0, I’ll get +15, while the opponent loses 15 when I do so.”

But note: **You don't control the opponent**. So even if you sign, the contract only applies **if they also sign**.

Therefore, the outcome depends on whether the other player will sign too.

But the question *is*: "Should you sign?" — under the assumption that the contract was selected via approval voting (i.e., it’s a proposal that may or may not be accepted).

So your decision is: **should you agree to this contract?** (We assume you can't force the other player to sign.)

Now, the key is: what happens **if you sign**, and **what happens if you don’t sign**?

But here’s the catch: **If you sign, but the other player does not**, then the contract **does not take effect**. So signing without their agreement is ineffective — you just make yourself vulnerable (in a sense?) but gain nothing.

Wait: Is that correct?

Actually, let’s clarify: **"The contract becomes active only if all players sign it."** So **signing the contract has no effect unless both sign**.

That means:
- If **you sign and the other doesn’t**, the contract is inactive — nothing changes.
- If **you don’t sign and they do**, same thing.
- Only if **both sign**, then the bonus applies.

Thus, **your decision to sign is conditional on your expectation about the other player’s willingness to sign**.

But we don’t have any information about the other player’s preferences — only that this contract was proposed by Player 1 (you), and submitted via approval voting (possibly implying that it's a candidate for adoption, and voters included you and them).

But since you're being asked to decide whether to sign, and we’re supposed to act optimally as Player 1, we must reason about **expected value assuming rationality and mutual consistency**.

---

### Step 3: Simulate the Effect of the Contract (If Signed by Both)

Suppose both players **do sign** the contract.

Then, the payoff matrix is modified.

Recall: If a player chooses A0, they receive **+15** (paid from the other player).

So, let’s rewrite the entire payoff table **under the contract**.

New payoffs (for Player 1 first, then Player 2):

| P1 Action | P2 Action | P1 Payoff (original) | P2 Payoff (original) | Adjustment (A0 → +15 to choosers, -15 from others) | Final P1 Payoff | Final P2 Payoff |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| A0       | A0        | 10                    | 10                   | P1 gets +15; P2 gets -15 (because P1 chose A0) | 10 + 15 = 25     | 10 – 15 = -5     |
| A0       | A1        | 0                     | 20                   | P1 gets +15; P2 gets -15 (P1 chose A0), **but P2 chose A1** → P2 not affected | 0 + 15 = 15      | 20 – 15 = 5      |
| A1       | A0        | 6                     | 2                    | P1 gets 0 (didn’t choose A0); P2 got -15 because P1 chose A1 → no → P2 only pays if **they** choose A0 | 6                | 2 – 15 = -13     |
| A1       | A1        | 4                     | 4                    | Neither chooses A0 → no adjustment | 4                | 4                |

Wait! Critical point: **The contract only gives +15 to someone who chooses A0**, and **takes 15 from the other player only if YOU choose A0**.

So the cost is applied to the **other player when YOU choose A0**, not when they choose A0.

So correction:

- When **you choose A0**, you get +15, and the **other player loses 15**.
- When **you choose A1**, no change.
- The other player’s action doesn't trigger any cost to you unless they choose A0 *and* you did too — no, actually, **it's only about YOUR choice**.

So the adjustment is: **Only based on your own action**:
- If **you play A0** → you get +15; opponent loses 15
- If **you play A1** → no change

So revise the table:

| P1 Action | P2 Action | Original P1 | Original P2 | After Contract (P1: +15 if A0; P2 loses 15 if P1 chooses A0) | Final P1 | Final P2 |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| A0       | A0        | 10          | 10          | P1: +15; P2: -15 → P1: 25, P2: -5                         | 25       | -5       |
| A0       | A1        | 0           | 20          | P1: +15; P2: -15 → P1: 15, P2: 5                          | 15       | 5        |
| A1       | A0        | 6           | 2           | No adjustment (P1 played A1) → P1: 6, P2: 2               | 6        | 2        |
| A1       | A1        | 4           | 4           | No change                                                  | 4        | 4        |

So now, **payoffs if both sign contract**:

- (A0,A0): (25, -5)
- (A0,A1): (15, 5)
- (A1,A0): (6, 2) ← note: opposite player playing A0 doesn’t hurt you unless you play A0
- (A1,A1): (4, 4)

Now, what’s the Nash equilibrium of this new game?

#### Analyze best responses under contract:

For Player 1 (you):
- If opponent plays A0:
  - You get 25 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1:
  - You get 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So **no matter what the opponent does, A0 is strictly better for you**.

For Player 2:
- If you play A0:
  - They get -5 (if they play A0) or 5 (if they play A1)
- If you play A1:
  - They get 2 (if they play A0) or 4 (if they play A1)

So for Player 2:
- If you play A0:
  - Their best response: A1 (gets 5 > -5)
- If you play A1:
  - Their best response: A1 (gets 4 > 2)

So Player 2's best response:
- If you play A0 → play A1
- If you play A1 → play A1

→ So they always prefer A1.

Therefore, **if both players sign the contract**, the unique Nash equilibrium is:
- You play **A0**
- Opponent plays **A1** → result is (15, 5)

So under the contract, you get **15 points**, opponent gets 5.

Compare that to the original game without contract.

What is the **equilibrium without contract**?

Original game:

|         | A0    | A1    |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **A0**  | 10,10 | 0,20  |
| **A1**  | 6,2   | 4,4   |

Best responses:
- If they play A0: you prefer A0 (10 > 6)
- If they play A1: you prefer A1 (4 > 0)

So two pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → (10,10)
- (A1, A1) → (4,4)

Also possible mixed strategies.

Now, **which one is more likely**?

But crucially: **(A0, A0)** is Pareto superior — both get 10, vs only 4 each.

But (A0, A0) is risky: if you think opponent might play A1, you'd get 0.

In fact, (A0, A0) is fragile — once it fails, you get 0.

(A1, A1) is safe but worse.

Now, in many such games, players might coordinate on (A0, A0) if they trust each other.

But is it stable?

Note: (A0, A0) is not a strong equilibrium — if you think opponent plays A0, you prefer A0. But if they deviate to A1, you get 0, which is bad.

So perhaps rational players might avoid it due to fear of exploitation.

But back to our main question: should **you** sign the contract?

We’ve seen:
- If both sign → you get **15 points** (in equilibrium: you play A0, opponent plays A1)
- Without contract: what do you get?
  - In (A0, A0): 10
  - In (A1, A1): 4
  - But is (A0, A0) credible?

Now, here’s the **critical insight**: **The contract makes A0 dominant for you** — regardless of the opponent’s choice.

So if **you sign**, you are guaranteed to play A0 in equilibrium → getting either 15 or 25 depending on opponent.

But opponent, if they also sign, will play A1 (since they see A1 is best regardless).

So **you commit to A0**, and they respond with A1 → you get 15.

Is 15 better than what you’d get unilaterally?

Yes — **if you expect not to coordinate on (A0, A0)**, then 15 is much better than 4.

Even if you **could** coordinate on (A0, A0), you only get 10 — which is less than 15.

So **even if you think (A0, A0) is achievable without the contract**, you get 10 — but with the contract, you can achieve 15 safely, without risk.

But wait — what if the other player refuses to sign?

Then the contract doesn’t take effect → no change.

So your payoff remains unchanged.

So if you sign and they don’t → you get no benefit.

But if you **don’t sign**, and they don’t sign → same outcome.

The only benefit is if **both sign**, then you get increased payoff.

Thus, signing is **only beneficial if the other player also signs**.

So should you sign?

It depends on your **belief about whether the other player will sign**.

But we are supposed to **maximize total points received**. And we are making a rational choice.

Now, here’s the twist: **The contract was proposed by you (Player 1)**, and submitted via approval voting.

Approval voting implies that everyone votes yes/no. But you’re being asked if **you** should vote yes.

Now, here’s a critical idea: **Can you induce the other player to sign by signing yourself?**

Not necessarily — they might see no benefit.

But let’s suppose you believe the other player is rational and will only sign if it benefits them.

So evaluate: **Would the other player benefit from signing the contract?**

Let’s analyze from **their perspective** (Player 2).

Suppose both sign the contract.

Then the payoff table is:

| P1 Action | P2 Action | P1 Payoff | P2 Payoff |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| A0       | A0        | 25        | -5        |
| A0       | A1        | 15        | 5         |
| A1       | A0        | 6         | 2         |
| A1       | A1        | 4         | 4         |

From **Player 2’s view**:
- If you play A0:
  - They get -5 (if A0) or 5 (if A1) → prefer A1
- If you play A1:
  - They get 2 (if A0) or 4 (if A1) → prefer A1

So **best response: A1**, regardless of your action.

So **they never want to play A0** under the contract.

Hence, if they sign the contract, they get:
- 5 (if you play A0)
- 4 (if you play A1)

In either case, they get at least 4.

But their **maximum** is 5.

Now, compare to **without contract**:

In original game, they could get:
- 10 (in (A0, A0))
- 2 (in (A1, A0)) — but you would prefer A1 if they play A0
- 20 (in (A0, A1)) → but only if you play A0 and they play A1
- 4 (in (A1, A1))

So **they can get 20** if you play A0 and they play A1.

But **if they sign the contract**, they are forced into a world where they **cannot get 20 again** — because if they play A1 and you play A0, they only get **5**, not 20.

Moreover, they can’t get high payoff from A0 anymore — they get -5.

So **by signing**, they **lose all possibility of getting 20**.

Their maximum payoff under the contract is **5**.

Whereas **without** the contract, they can potentially get **20** (if you play A0 and they play A1).

So **they have a strong incentive not to sign**, because signing **locks them into a lower maximum**.

But what if they know you will sign?

Still — if you sign, we saw that you **always want to play A0** (due to +15 bonus).

And if you play A0, they get **only 5** (not 20), so they lose out.

So **signing is bad for the opponent**.

Therefore, **the other player will not sign**, because:
- They get only 5 max under contract
- Without contract, they can get 20
- So signing reduces their best option

Hence, **the other player will refuse to sign the contract**.

Therefore, **if you sign**, they won’t — so **the contract is inactive** → no change in payoff.

But **if you do not sign**, and they don’t sign → same outcome.

So **there is no expected benefit to signing**, because the contract won’t activate.

Therefore, signing **only creates a situation where you are worse off relative to possibilities**, but no gain.

Wait — but is that valid?

Alternative scenario: **Suppose you sign and the other doesn’t**.

But the contract only activates if both sign.

So if they don’t sign, contract is invalid → you get normal payoff.

But you were going to get normal payoff anyway.

So no difference.

But **you made a commitment** that might harm you?

No — you didn’t commit anything. Signing just says: “I approve that if both sign, these rules apply”.

But you don’t give up anything unless the contract activates.

So if it doesn’t activate, nothing happens.

So the only downside is if you **think** you might benefit from the contract, but can’t induce the other to sign.

But we’ve seen: the **other player has no incentive to sign**, because they would lose out on the ability to get 20 points.

In fact, their maximum drops from 20 to 5.

So they definitely won’t sign.

Therefore, the contract **will never activate**, regardless of whether you sign.

So signing the contract **does not change anything**.

But now: what if you could **force** them to sign?

No — you can’t.

So final conclusion:
- Signing the contract provides **no benefit**, because the other player **will not sign**.
- Therefore, signing leads to **no change** in outcome.
- Not signing also leads to no change.
- Since there’s no benefit, and no downside, **why sign?**

But wait — is there **any case** where signing could help?

Suppose you believed that by signing, you could change their behavior.

But they are rational, and they see that signing reduces their payoff potential.

Unless they misperceive, they won’t sign.

So **no incentive to sign**.

Hence, **you should not sign**.

But wait — earlier we thought with contract, you get 15, compared to 10 or 4.

But **that only happens if they sign**, which they won’t.

So **you cannot achieve that**.

Therefore, **your expected payoff from signing is the same as not signing:** the real (uncontracted) game.

But **unless** you can somehow convince them to sign — you can’t.

So **optimal action: do not sign**.

---

### Final Answer:

You should not sign the contract because:
- It only activates if both sign.
- The other player has no incentive to sign, as it reduces their maximum possible payoff from 20 to 5.
- Therefore, the contract will not be activated.
- Signing provides no benefit and carries no advantage.
- Hence, you should **not sign**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether Player 1 should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

The base payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:

|               | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0**     | (10,10) | (0,20) |
| **P1 A1**     | (6,2)   | (4,4)  |

We are Player 1, so we care about maximizing our own expected points.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Strategic Behavior Without Contract

In a simultaneous-move game like this, we can consider Nash equilibrium strategies. Let’s find the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (if any).

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that Player 1 plays A0.
- $ q $ = probability that Player 2 plays A0.

Player 1’s expected payoff for choosing A0:

$$
E_1(A0) = q \cdot 10 + (1-q) \cdot 0 = 10q
$$

Player 1’s expected payoff for choosing A1:

$$
E_1(A1) = q \cdot 6 + (1-q) \cdot 4 = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4
$$

Player 1 is indifferent when:

$$
10q = 2q + 4 \Rightarrow 8q = 4 \Rightarrow q = 0.5
$$

So, if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.5, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now consider Player 2’s incentives.

Player 2’s expected payoff for playing A0:

$$
E_2(A0) = p \cdot 10 + (1-p) \cdot 2 = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2
$$

Player 2’s expected payoff for playing A1:

$$
E_2(A1) = p \cdot 20 + (1-p) \cdot 4 = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4
$$

Set equal for indifference:

$$
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 \Rightarrow -8p = 2 \Rightarrow p = -0.25
$$

This is impossible (probability can't be negative), meaning Player 2 **never** wants to play A0 if $ p > 0 $. Actually, since the derivative of E2(A1) is higher than E2(A0) for all $ p $, A1 dominates A0 for Player 2.

Let’s verify:  
At $ p = 0 $:  
- A0: 2  
- A1: 4 → better

At $ p = 1 $:  
- A0: 10  
- A1: 20 → still better

So no matter what p is, A1 always gives Player 2 a higher payoff than A0.

Thus, **Player 2 will always play A1 in equilibrium**.

Therefore, in the unique Nash equilibrium:  
- Player 2 plays A1 with probability 1  
- Player 1 chooses A0 or A1 depending on which gives higher payoff given q = 1.

Given q = 1 (P2 plays A1),  
- P1’s payoff from A0: 0  
- P1’s payoff from A1: 4

So P1 prefers A1 → plays A1.

**Base game outcome: (A1, A1) → (4, 4)**

---

### Step 3: Consider the Contract

> The contract:  
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 15 points, drawn equally from the other player(s).  
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payment.

Important details:
- The contract is only active if **all players sign it**.
- You are Player 1, deciding whether to sign.
- The 15 points awarded to a player who chooses A0 come from the other player(s) — i.e., *deducted from your opponent*.
- So if you play A0, you get +15 points, and the other player loses 15.
- Similarly, if the other player plays A0, they get +15, and you lose 15.

But crucially: **this applies only if both players sign**.

---

### Step 4: Analyze Outcomes Under the Contract

Assume you **sign** the contract. Then the contract is active **only if the other player also signs**.

We must assume the other player will decide independently. But we don’t know their decision. We need to evaluate whether signing is rational **assuming rational self-interest**.

Let’s suppose you **sign**, and assume the other player might sign too. Then we analyze the game under the contract.

Let’s redefine the payoff matrix **with the contract in effect**, assuming both players have signed.

---

#### New Payoffs (With Contract, Both Players Signed)

We now add the 15-point transfer whenever someone plays A0, taken from the other player.

So modify payoffs:

- If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0:  
  Base: (10,10)  
  P1 gets +15 (for playing A0), but pays 15 to P2 → net:  
  P1: 10 + 15 - 15 = 10? Wait — hold on.

Wait: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn equally from the other players" — implies that each other player pays 7.5? No — “drawn equally” likely means the total 15 is split among other players.

There is only one other player, so:

- When a player plays A0, they receive +15, and the other player loses 15.

Yes, that makes sense: the cost is fully transferred to the other player.

So:

##### Case: P1 A0, P2 A0  
- P1: base 10 + 15 (from contract) - 15 (paid to P2)? No — wait.

Clarify:  
- "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So:  
- When a player (say P1) plays A0, they get +15.  
- This 15 is taken equally from the other players.  
- Since there's only one other player (P2), P2 pays all 15.

Similarly, if P2 plays A0, P2 gets +15, P1 pays 15.

So net effect:  
Each time someone plays A0, they gain +15, and the other player loses 15.

Now let’s compute full payoffs with contract active (both signed):

|               | P2 A0                  | P2 A1                 |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **P1 A0**     | P1: 10 + 15 - 15 = 10? | P1: 0 + 15 = 15<br>P2: 20 - 15 = 5 |
| **P1 A1**     | P1: 6 - 15 = -9<br>P2: 2 + 15 = 17 | P1: 4 + 0 = 4<br>P2: 4 + 0 = 4 |

Wait: let's do carefully:

When P1 plays A0:
- Gets +15 from contract
- P2 loses 15 (since P2 is the other player)

When P2 plays A0:
- Gets +15 from contract
- P1 loses 15

So:

#### Payoff Table With Contract Active (Both Signed)

| P1 \ P2 | A0                            | A1                            |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| A0      | (10 + 15, 10 - 15) = (25, -5) | (0 + 15, 20 - 15) = (15, 5)   |
| A1      | (6 - 15, 2 + 15) = (-9, 17)   | (4, 4)                        |

Wait — here’s a problem: in the A1,A0 case: P1 plays A1, so no contract benefit. But P2 plays A0 ⇒ P2 gets +15, P1 loses 15.

So P1: 6 (base) - 15 (from P2 playing A0) = -9  
P2: 2 + 15 = 17

Yes.

Similarly, in A0,A1: P1 plays A0 ⇒ gets +15; P2 plays A1 ⇒ no contract for P2 ⇒ P1 doesn't give anything to P2 via contract for A1. So only consequence is: P1 gains +15, P2 loses nothing from contract.

But wait — when P1 plays A0, **they get +15** — regardless of what P2 does. That +15 is taken from P2.

So yes — P1 gets +15 **anytime they play A0**, paid by P2.

Similarly, P2 gets +15 whenever they play A0, paid by P1.

So the above table is correct.

Final contract-enabled matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0           | A1            |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| A0      | (25, -5)     | (15, 5)       |
| A1      | (-9, 17)     | (4, 4)        |

Now, we need to see what happens in this **new game**.

But remember: this contract only applies if **both** players sign it.

You are deciding whether to sign.

So you need to ask: **If I sign, and assuming the other player may or may not sign, what should I do?**

But since they decide independently, we need to **simulate their reasoning**.

Let’s consider two cases:

---

### Case A: You Sign, Other Player Signs → Contract Active → Game as above

Solve for Nash equilibrium in the new game.

Let:
- $ p $ = P1 plays A0
- $ q $ = P2 plays A0

P1’s best response:

- E1(A0) = q·25 + (1−q)·15 = 25q + 15 − 15q = 10q + 15
- E1(A1) = q·(-9) + (1−q)·4 = -9q + 4 − 4q = -13q + 4

Set equal:

10q + 15 = -13q + 4  
23q = -11 → q = -11/23 ≈ -0.478 → impossible

So E1(A0) is always greater than E1(A1) because even at q=0:  
- E1(A0) = 15  
- E1(A1) = 4 → worse

And increasing q → E1(A0) increases, E1(A1) decreases.

So P1 **always prefers A0** with contract in effect.

Now check P2:

- E2(A0) = p·(-5) + (1−p)·17 = -5p + 17 − 17p = -22p + 17
- E2(A1) = p·5 + (1−p)·4 = 5p + 4 − 4p = p + 4

Set equal:

-22p + 17 = p + 4  
17 - 4 = 23p → 13 = 23p → p = 13/23 ≈ 0.565

So P2 is indifferent at p ≈ 0.565

For p < 0.565:  
- E2(A1) > E2(A0) → P2 plays A1

For p > 0.565:  
- E2(A0) > E2(A1) → P2 plays A0

But since P1 is playing A0 for sure (strictly dominant), p = 1 > 0.565 → P2 plays A0.

So equilibrium: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0 → outcome: (25, -5)

But wait — can P2 afford to play A0? They get -5!

What if P2 knows this?

Let’s double-check P2’s strategy when P1 plays A0:

- A0: P2 gets -5
- A1: P2 gets 5

So clearly, P2 strictly prefers A1.

But according to previous calculation, when p=1, then:

- E2(A0) = -5(1) + 17(0) = -5
- E2(A1) = 5 → better

So at p=1, P2’s best response is A1.

Therefore, if P1 plays A0 (because it’s dominant), then P2 will play A1.

So outcome becomes: A0 (P1), A1 (P2) → (15, 5)

Now, is A0 still dominant for P1?

Check at q=0 (P2 plays A1):

- E1(A0) = 15
- E1(A1) = 4 → still A0 better

If P2 played A0, P1 would get 25 vs -9 → still prefer A0.

So yes — A0 is strictly dominant for P1 even if P2 plays A1.

Thus, **with contract active and both signed**, the equilibrium is:

- P1 plays A0
- P2 plays A1
→ Outcome: (15, 5)

P1 gets 15 points.

Compare to base game: P1 got **4 points**.

So **if the contract is active**, you get 15 points — much better.

But is P2 going to sign the contract?

---

### Case B: Is It Rational For P2 to Sign?

P2 is considering whether to sign the contract.

They want to maximize their own points.

They face the same situation: if they sign, and you sign, they enter the contract game.

But if they sign, and you sign, then the payoff depends on strategies.

If P2 signs, and they believe you will play A0, then P2 gets 5 points (from A0,A1 outcome).

But if they **don’t** sign, then contract doesn’t apply.

If P2 doesn’t sign, the base game applies.

So we compare P2’s payoff in two scenarios:

#### Option 1: P2 does NOT sign → no contract ever

Then the base game applies, as before.

We already concluded:  
- P2 plays A1 (dominant)
- P1 plays A1 (best response)
→ (4,4)

So P2 gets **4 points**.

#### Option 2: P2 DOES sign, and you also sign → contract active

Then as above, equilibrium is:
- P1 plays A0
- P2 plays A1
→ P2 gets **5 points**

So P2 gets 5 > 4 → better off signing.

Therefore, **P2 has incentive to sign the contract**, because they get 5 instead of 4.

So if you sign, P2 will also sign (rational self-interest).

Thus, if you sign, the contract becomes effective, and you end up with **15 points**.

---

### But Wait — What If You Don’t Sign?

Then the contract is **not activated**, regardless of what P2 does.

Because contract needs all to sign.

So if you don’t sign, then no contract → base game applied.

As before: P2 plays A1, P1 plays A1 → (4,4)

So you get **4 points**.

---

### Final Comparison

- If you **sign**: contract is active (P2 signs too, because it benefits them), you get 15 points
- If you **don’t sign**: no contract, you get 4 points

Clearly, 15 > 4 → **you should sign**

---

### Final Check: Why Does P2 Still Sign?

Even though they pay 15 when you play A0? In the final outcome: you play A0, they play A1 → so they get:

- Base: 20 (from A1,A0) → no, wait: A1 versus A0

Wait: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → base payoff: (0,20)

Then contract: P1 played A0 → P1 gets +15, P2 pays 15 → so:

- P1: 0 + 15 = 15
- P2: 20 - 15 = 5 → yes

Even though P2 could choose to not sign, if they don’t, they get 4 (from (4,4)) → less than 5.

So yes, P2 will sign.

So your signing triggers a chain where P2 also signs, and you get 15.

No downside.

---

### Conclusion:

Signing the contract leads to a better outcome for you: 15 > 4.

It also makes P2 better off (they go from 4 to 5), so they will agree.

Thus, signing is strictly beneficial for you.

response:
Let’s break this down step by step to decide whether **Player 2** should sign the contract.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without the contract)**

The game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)       |
| **Player 2: A1** | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

Note: Since we are **Player 2**, the payoffs are listed as (Player 1's points, Player 2's points).

We want to maximize **our own** total points — that is, **Player 2's** points.

Let’s analyze the original game without the contract.

---

### **Step 2: Find best responses and Nash equilibria (original game)**

We will consider mixed strategies. Let:
- $ p $ = probability that Player 1 chooses A0
- $ q $ = probability that Player 2 chooses A0

We want to find optimal strategies.

---

#### **Player 2’s expected payoff if we choose A0:**
- If Player 1 plays A0 (prob $ p $): get 10
- If Player 1 plays A1 (prob $ 1-p $): get 2  
→ Expected payoff = $ 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2 $

#### **Player 2’s expected payoff if we choose A1:**
- If Player 1 plays A0 (prob $ p $): get 0
- If Player 1 plays A1 (prob $ 1-p $): get 4  
→ Expected payoff = $ 0 \cdot p + 4(1-p) = 4 - 4p $

Now, Player 2 will choose A0 if:
$$
8p + 2 > 4 - 4p
\Rightarrow 12p > 2
\Rightarrow p > \frac{1}{6}
$$

So:
- If $ p > \frac{1}{6} $, Player 2 prefers A0
- If $ p < \frac{1}{6} $, Player 2 prefers A1
- If $ p = \frac{1}{6} $, indifferent

Now consider Player 1’s incentives.

Let’s find Player 1’s best response.

#### **Player 1’s expected payoff:**
- If Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Player 2 chooses A0 (prob $ q $): get 10
  - Player 2 chooses A1 (prob $ 1-q $): get 20
  → Expected: $ 10q + 20(1-q) = 20 - 10q $

- If Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Player 2 chooses A0 (prob $ q $): get 6
  - Player 2 chooses A1 (prob $ 1-q $): get 4
  → Expected: $ 6q + 4(1-q) = 4 + 2q $

Player 1 prefers A0 if:
$$
20 - 10q > 4 + 2q
\Rightarrow 16 > 12q
\Rightarrow q < \frac{4}{3} \Rightarrow \text{Always true since } q \leq 1
$$
Wait, actually:
$$
20 - 10q > 4 + 2q \Rightarrow 16 > 12q \Rightarrow q < \frac{4}{3} \Rightarrow \text{Always true}
$$

So **Player 1 always prefers A0** regardless of q?

Wait — that can't be right. Let's plug in $ q = 1 $: Player 2 always plays A0.

- A0: 10
- A1: 6 → so A0 better

$ q = 0 $: Player 2 always A1

- A0: 20
- A1: 4 → A0 better

So indeed, **A0 strictly dominates A1 for Player 1** in the original game.

Thus, **Player 1 will play A0 with probability 1** (in Nash equilibrium).

Now go back to Player 2’s best response:

- If Player 1 plays A0 (prob 1), then:
  - A0 gives 10
  - A1 gives 0
  → So Player 2 chooses A0

→ **Nash equilibrium: (A0, A0)**

Other equilibria? Suppose Player 2 plays A0, then Player 1 is best-responding with A0.

If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 still prefers A0, but Player 2 would prefer A0 over A1 if Player 1 plays A0.

So the only Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0), where both play A0 and get 10 each.

---

### **Step 3: Introduce the contract**

The contract says:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other player.

This means:
- If a player plays A0, they get **+10 bonus**, but **the other player loses 10 points** (since the bonus is "drawn from the other players").
- If a player plays A1, **no extra payment** in either direction.

Note: The contract is **only active if both players sign**. We are deciding whether to sign.

Let’s analyze how this changes the payoffs.

---

### **Step 4: New payoff matrix with contract (if both sign)**

Since both must sign for the contract to be active, let’s assume we decide to sign → contract takes effect.

Now the payoffs become:

#### Case: Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A0:
- Base payoffs: (10, 10)
- Both chose A0 → both get +10
- So Player 1 gets 10 + 10 = 20
- Player 2 gets 10 + 10 = 20
- But wait: "drawn equally from the other players" → the 10 bonus comes from the **other player**.

So:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → they gain 10, but Player 2 loses 10
- If Player 2 plays A0 → they gain 10, but Player 1 loses 10

So bonuses are **transfers between players**.

Thus, for (A0, A0):
- Player 1: gets 10 (base) + 10 (A0 bonus) but **loses 10** because Player 2 played A0 → net: 10 +10 -10 = 10
- Player 2: gets 10 (base) +10 (A0 bonus) but loses 10 because Player 1 played A0 → net: 10 +10 -10 = 10

So net: **(10, 10)** — unchanged.

Wait — is that correct?

Let’s re-read:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn equally from the other players" — there is only one other player. So it's drawn from that one player.

So if **both** choose A0:
- Each gets +10
- But each also pays 10 to the other

So **net: no change** in payoff — still (10,10)

#### Case: Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0:
- Base: (20, 0)
- Player 1 played A0 → gets +10
- Player 2 played A1 → no bonus, and no penalty
- But the bonus for Player 1’s A0 is **taken from Player 2** — so Player 2 loses 10

So:
- Player 1: 20 (base) + 10 (bonus) = 30
- Player 2: 0 (base) - 10 (loss due to Player 1's A0) = -10

New payoff: **(30, -10)**

Wait — but is that correct?

Let’s clarify the contract mechanism.

The contract states:
- If you choose A0 → you get +10
- This +10 comes from the **other player(s)** → so the other player loses 10

So each A0 choice causes **the other player to lose 10**

Therefore:
- When Player 1 chooses A0 → Player 2 loses 10
- When Player 2 chooses A0 → Player 1 loses 10

So the **net effect is that each A0 choice gives +10 to you and -10 to the other player**

So:

#### Updated payoff matrix (with contract, both sign)

|               | P1: A0         | P1: A1         |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P2: A0**    | (10, 10)       | (2 - 10, 6 + 10) = (-8, 16) |
| **P2: A1**    | (20 + 10, 0 - 10) = (30, -10) | (4, 4) |

Let’s verify:

1. (A0, A0):
   - P1: base 10 +10 (A0 bonus) -10 (because P2 played A0) = 10
   - P2: base 10 +10 (A0 bonus) -10 (because P1 played A0) = 10
   → (10,10)

2. (A0, A1): P2 plays A1
   - P1: A0 → gets +10, but P2 played A1 → so no penalty from P2 → so P1 gets +10 total
     - Base: 20 → new: 20 +10 = 30
   - P2: A1 → no bonus, but P1 played A0 → so P2 **loses 10**
     - Base: 0 → new: 0 -10 = -10
   → (30, -10)

3. (A1, A0): P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1
   - P1: A1 → no bonus → base: 6 → no changes
     - But P2 played A0 → so P1 loses 10 → 6 -10 = -4
   - P2: A0 → gets +10 → base: 2 → 2 +10 = 12
   - But P1 played A1 → so P2 does **not** lose anything (no penalty from P1)
   → So P1: 6 -10 = **-4**, P2: 2 +10 = **12**
   Wait: hold on.

Actually:

- Player 1 plays A1 → no bonus → no gain
- But Player 2 plays A0 → so **Player 1 loses 10** (because P2 played A0)
- So Player 1’s total: base 6 + 0 (no A0 bonus) -10 (penalty for P2’s A0) = -4
- Player 2: base 2 +10 (A0 bonus) +0 (P1 played A1 → no penalty) = 12

So (P1, P2) = (-4, 12)

But earlier I said (A0, A1) → (P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1) → I had it backward.

Let’s redefine:

Rows = Player 2, Columns = Player 1

So:

|               | P1: A0         | P1: A1         |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P2: A0**    | (10,10)        | (-4,12)        |
| **P2: A1**    | (30,-10)       | (4,4)          |

Let’s explain:

- (A0, A0): both get +10 bonus, each loses 10 to the other → net: (10,10)
- (A0, A1): P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1
  - P2: A0 → +10 (bonus), P1 played A1 → no penalty → base 2 → total 12
  - P1: A1 → no bonus, but P2 played A0 → so loses 10 → base 6 → total 6 -10 = -4
  → (-4,12)

- (A1, A0): P2 plays A1, P1 plays A0
  - P1: A0 → +10 bonus, P2 played A1 → so no penalty → base 20 → total 30
  - P2: A1 → no bonus, P1 played A0 → so loses 10 → base 0 → total -10
  → (30, -10)

- (A1, A1): both A1 → no bonuses, no penalties → base payoffs (4,4) → unchanged

So final payoff matrix with contract (both players sign):

|               | P1: A0      | P1: A1      |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **P2: A0**    | (10,10)     | (-4,12)     |
| **P2: A1**    | (30,-10)    | (4,4)       |

---

### **Step 5: Analyze optimal strategy under contract**

We are Player 2. We are choosing whether to sign the contract → so **if we sign**, then this new matrix applies (and we assume Player 1 will also sign, since we are considering the contract becoming active).

We must ask: **If both sign, what will happen? Does signing improve our expected payoff?**

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium of this new game.

Let $ p $ = P1 chooses A0  
Let $ q $ = P2 chooses A0

#### Player 2’s best response:

Expected payoff from A0:
- P1 plays A0 (prob $ p $): get 10
- P1 plays A1 (prob $ 1-p $): get 12
→ $ 10p + 12(1-p) = 12 - 2p $

Expected payoff from A1:
- P1 plays A0 (prob $ p $): get -10
- P1 plays A1 (prob $ 1-p $): get 4
→ $ -10p + 4(1-p) = 4 - 14p $

Set $ 12 - 2p > 4 - 14p $:
→ $ 8 > -12p $ → always true (since $ p \geq 0 $)

So for all $ p $, $ 12 - 2p > 4 - 14p $

Indeed:
- If $ p = 0 $: A0 gives 12, A1 gives 4 → A0 better
- If $ p = 1 $: A0 gives 10, A1 gives -10 → A0 better

So **A0 strictly dominates A1 for Player 2** in the contract game.

→ **Player 2 will always play A0**

Now, Player 1’s best response:

If P2 plays A0 (as they will), then:

- P1 plays A0: gets 10 (from matrix)
- P1 plays A1: gets -4 (from matrix)

→ So P1 prefers A0

Therefore, **Nash equilibrium: (P1: A0, P2: A0)**

Result: both play A0 → payoffs (10,10)

Same as original game!

So **if we sign the contract**, and both players play optimally, we still end up at (10,10)

But wait — is that all?

But the contract **doesn't change the final payoffs** at equilibrium — it's still (10,10)

So **if the contract leads to the same outcome, and doesn't help us, should we sign?**

Wait — but what if **Player 1 is not rational** or **doesn't play optimally?**

No — in game theory, we assume rational players. So both will play optimally.

But here’s the key: in the **original game**, (A0, A0) is the equilibrium.

In the **contract game**, (A0, A0) is also the equilibrium — but **only if both sign**.

Wait — but hold on. What if **Player 1 does not sign**?

We have to consider the **risk of signing**.

Let’s check: what if **we sign**, but **Player 1 does not**?

Then the contract does **not** activate.

Only if **both** sign does it activate.

So, we have two possibilities:

### Option 1: **We sign** → contract activates only if Player 1 also signs

But we don’t know if Player 1 will sign — so we must consider their incentives.

But since Player 1 is rational, they will **only sign if it benefits them**.

So we must check: **Does Player 1 benefit from signing the contract?**

Let’s check Player 1’s perspective.

#### Player 1’s payoffs with contract (if they sign):

We already computed the matrix assuming both sign:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10     | -4     |
| **P1: A1**    | 30     | 4      |

In this game, if Player 1 plays optimally, they will play A0 (since A0 gives 10 or -4; A1 gives 30 or 4 → wait, actually A1 gives higher payoffs?).

Wait — compare:

- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 30 (A1) → A1 better
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets -4 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → A1 better

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 1** in the contract game!

Wait a minute — this contradicts earlier.

Let’s re-check.

In the matrix above:
- P1: A0, P2: A0 → P1 gets 10
- P1: A1, P2: A0 → P1 gets 30
- P1: A0, P2: A1 → P1 gets -4
- P1: A1, P2: A1 → P1 gets 4

So A1 is better than A0 in **both** cases:
- vs P2: A0 → 30 > 10
- vs P2: A1 → 4 > -4

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 1**.

So if Player 1 signs the contract, they will **always play A1**, regardless of what P2 does.

But then P2 is playing A0 (in equilibrium) → so P1 plays A1 → P2 gets -10

Wait — but P2 is also rational — they know this.

But if Player 1 signs, and plays A1 no matter what, then:

- P2 gets:
  - If A0: 12 (from earlier: base 2 +10 bonus - no penalty from P1)
  - But P1 is playing A1 → so P2’s A0 gives +10 (bonus), and P1 played A1 → so no penalty → so total 2 +10 = 12

Wait — in (P2: A0, P1: A1) with contract: P2 gets 2 +10 = 12, P1 gets 6 -10 = -4

But if P1 signs, they will play A1 **no matter what** → so P2 will get 12 if playing A0, 4 if playing A1.

So P2 will still play A0 → get 12

But what if P2 plays A1? Then gets 4 → worse

So P2 still plays A0

But P1 gets -4 (if P2 plays A0)

But earlier, if P1 played A0, they’d get 10 — but now they get -4 → worse

But P1 could play A1 voluntarily without signing?

No — if Player 1 **signs**, they must follow the contract.

But the contract doesn’t force them to choose actions — it only says: if you choose A0, you get +10 (but pay 10 to other), etc.

But if Player 1 is rational and signs, then their **strategic response** is to choose actions that maximize their payoff **under the contract**.

We just showed: **A1 strictly dominates A0**.

So **Player 1, if they sign the contract, will play A1 with probability 1**, regardless of P2's action.

Then P2, knowing this, will play A0 → gets 12

But P1 gets -4 (in this case)

But if P1 does **not** sign, then:

- Contract inactive
- So payoffs are original.

In original game, if P1 plays A1, and P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 6

If they play A1 and P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 4

But since P2 will play A0 (as in original equilibrium), P1 gets 6 if they play A1

But if they sign, they get -4 → much worse

So **Player 1 will NOT sign the contract**, because it's worse for them.

Even though **A1 dominates A0**, and they would play A1 anyway, the contract **forces them to pay 10 if they play A0**, but **they never play A0**.

But the contract is just passive: it applies only when you play a move.

But since P1 chooses A1 and never plays A0, the contract gives them **no benefit** and **no cost**.

But they still have to **sign** for it to activate.

And if they sign, and then play A1, no change.

But if they play A0, they get +10, but lose 10 to P2 → net zero.

But in this game, they won’t play A0 — because A1 dominates.

So signing doesn't help them.

But could it hurt?

No — if they never play A0, and A1 gives same base payoffs, then signing changes nothing.

But the contract says: "if a player chooses A0, they get +10 drawn from other players"

But if they don’t play A0, they get nothing.

But since they won't play A0, **the contract has no effect on them**.

So they could sign and it wouldn't hurt — but why bother?

But the key is: **Player 1 will not sign**, because **it could be used against them**?

No — but in this case, signing is **irrelevant** — they don’t play A0, so no gain, no loss.

So at best, they are indifferent.

But contract requires **all players sign** — so if Player 1 is indifferent, they might not sign.

But we don’t know.

But here’s the problem: **if we sign**, then the contract only activates if **Player 1 also signs**.

So if **Player 1 does not sign**, then the contract is not active → we are back to original game.

But if **Player 1 signs**, then P1 will play A1 (optimal), and we (P2) play A0 → then P2 gets **12**, P1 gets -4.

But P1 gets -4 → **worse than original**

In original game → if both play A0 → P1 gets 10

Now, if they sign and play A1 → get -4 → much worse

So **Player 1 has strong incentive not to sign**.

Therefore, **Player 1 will not sign**.

Thus, if we sign, the contract **will not activate**.

So we end up playing the original game.

But in the original game, **we can choose our action**.

We can play A0 → get 10 (if P1 plays A0)

But if we sign the contract, and it doesn't activate, we are still free to play A0 or A1.

But signing is irreversible — once we sign, the game becomes: if P1 signs → contract active → we face new payoffs.

But since P1 won’t sign, it doesn’t activate.

So **signing the contract is a waste — it does nothing**, and **we lose nothing**, but we might be vulnerable?

No.

But the question is: **do we ever benefit from signing?**

Let’s suppose we sign, and Player 1 also signs.

Then P1 plays A1 (best response), P2 plays A0 → we get 12.

But in original game, we get 10.

So **12 > 10**, so we benefit.

But P1 gets -4 < 10 — so **P1 has no reason to sign**.

So **P1 will not sign**.

Therefore, **contract will never activate**.

So if we sign, we are just tying our hands — but nothing changes.

But is there a case where signing helps?

Suppose we could **commit to A0** — then P1 might play A0, and we get 10, same as before.

But signing doesn’t force us to do anything.

The contract just changes payoffs **if** it activates.

But since it **won’t activate** (because P1 won’t sign), signing does nothing.

So **we are indifferent**?

But we are trying to maximize our expected points.

- If we do **not sign**: contract inactive → we play original game → equilibrium (A0,A0) → we get 10
- If we **sign**: contract inactive → same game → we still get 10

So same outcome.

But is that true?

Wait — what if we sign, and P1 signs? Then we get 12.

But P1 won’t sign.

But **what if we can induce P1 to sign**?

No — we can’t control P1’s action.

So we should assume P1 acts rationally.

P1 gets worse payoff if they sign and play A1.

So **P1 will not sign**.

Therefore, **contract will not be active**.

Thus, signing has no effect.

So we are indifferent.

But should we sign?

The contract costs us nothing — it only activates if P1 signs.

But in the original game, **we can already get 10**.

Unless we can **force a better outcome** by signing.

But we cannot — because P1 won’t sign.

Hence, **signing does not help**.

But could it hurt?

Only if it changes our strategy.

But in the original game, we play A0 → get 10.

In the contract game, we play A0 → get 12, but only if contract activates.

But since it won’t, we get 10 anyway.

So **signing has no benefit, and no cost**.

But the question is: **should we sign?**

If signing has no effect, but we are uncertain about P1's decision, but P1 is rational and won't sign, then no.

But is there any case where signing helps?

Suppose we sign and **P1 signs by mistake**.

But we must assume rationality.

Thus, P1 will not sign.

Therefore, contract is inactive.

So we get same payoff.

Hence, signing is **irrelevant**.

But the problem is: **do we benefit? No**.

But could we **avoid** a worse outcome?

No — in the original game, we get 10.

Is there a way to get more?

In the contract game, if we could get P1 to play A0, we could get 12 — but P1 won’t sign.

So no.

But here’s a catch: **in the original game, P1 will play A0 anyway**, and we play A0 → we get 10.

But if we sign, and P1 signs → we get 12.

But P1 won’t sign.

So we cannot get 12.

Therefore, **we are stuck at 10** in both cases.

So no loss.

But is there a risk?

What if the contract **changes our incentives**?

For example, if we sign, might we play differently?

But in both scenarios, we best-respond optimally.

In original: A0

In contract: A0 (still dominant)

So no change.

Therefore, signing has no impact on our strategy or payoff.

But the contract is not free — it requires signing.

But it costs us nothing.

So **we should sign**?

But only if it helps.

But it doesn’t.

But let’s consider: **can the contract help us in a strategic way?**

Suppose we sign, and P1 thinks we are committed to A0, and plays A0 — but in the contract, if P1 plays A0, and we play A0, we get 10 — same as before.

But if we sign and P1 signs, and we play A0, P1 gets -4 — worse.

So P1 will not play A0.

In fact, in contract game, **P1 will play A1** to avoid losing.

So P1 won’t play A0.

So we cannot get P1 to cooperate.

Therefore, **no benefit**.

Hence, **signing is not beneficial**.

But since it doesn't hurt, and might be a way to signal, but we can’t control P1.

Final decision: **We should not sign**, because it does not increase our payoff, and is not a strategic advantage.

But wait — what if the contract **increases the incentive to play A0**, but in this case it doesn’t change our best response.

We were going to play A0 anyway.

So no gain.

Moreover, if we sign, and P1 is fooled, but in rational world, no.

Therefore, **we should not sign**.

But let’s think differently.

Suppose we **do not sign**.

Then game is original: we get 10.

Suppose we **sign**.

Then:
- If P1 signs → we get 12 (if both play A0? No — if P1 signs, they play A1, so we play A0, get 12)
  - So we get 12
- If P1 does not sign → contract inactive → we get 10

But P1 will not sign (as they get -4 instead of 10)

So probability P1 signs is 0

So expected payoff if we sign: 10

Same as not signing.

So no difference.

But is there any room for cooperation? No.

But the contract might be used to **punish** P1 if they don't play A0.

But we can’t force it.

Conclusion: **Signing the contract does not improve our payoff**, and since P1 will not sign, we get the same outcome.

But the problem is: **should we sign?**

If we sign, and P1 does not sign, we are still safe.

But we gain nothing.

But is there a reason not to sign? No.

But the question is **maximize points**, and it's the same.

But perhaps we can argue that **without signing**, the game is symmetric, but with signing, we have a way to extract more if P1 signs — but P1 won't.

So no.

Final thought: **In the original game, the only equilibrium is (A0,A0) → we get 10**

With contract, if active, equilibrium is P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → we get 12

But it's not activated.

So to get 12, we need P1 to sign and play A1, but then we get 12, P1 gets -4 — P1 hates it.

So P1 will not sign.

So we cannot achieve 12.

Therefore, **signing the contract does not help**.

Moreover, since we don't gain, and the contract has no effect, we should not sign.

But wait — what if we sign, and P1 sees that we signed, and they are rational, and they know that if they sign, they get -4, so they won't sign.

So no.

Thus, **our best chance is to not sign** — but we still get 10.

But the contract might make us look cooporative, but no.

After careful thought, the contract **does not increase our expected payoff**, and since Player 1 will not sign, it will not activate.

Therefore, we should **not sign**.

But wait — let’s consider a different approach.

Suppose we **sign the contract**, but P1 does not sign.

Then the game is original.

We can play A0 → get 10.

But could we play A1? We could, but we get 0 if P1 plays A0.

But P1 will play A0, so we are better off playing A0.

So we play A0.

Same as before.

No change.

Final decision: **We should not sign the contract**, because it provides no benefit and could theoretically allow a worse outcome if P1 were to sign (but they won’t).

Since it doesn’t help, and might be seen as a commitment, but in this case, it doesn't change our incentives.

But we are indifferent.

But the problem asks to **maximize points**.

Since signing doesn’t increase expected points, and not signing gives the same, we can choose either.

But to be conservative, we should not sign.

But let’s see: in the original game, we get 10.

If we sign, and by some chance P1 signs, we get 12 — better.

But that won’t happen.

So expected payoff is still 10.

But is there a way to increase the probability?

No.

But the contract might be a way to **cooperate**.

But P1 has no incentive.

Therefore, **do not sign**.

But there’s a better idea:

In the original game, we get 10.

In the contract game (if activated), we get 12.

But P1 won’t sign.

But if we sign, and P1 thinks that we might be playing A0, and they think that if they play A0, they get 10, but with contract, they lose 10 if we play A0.

But still.

No.

Final decision:

**The contract doesn't improve our expected payoff.**
**Player 1 will not sign.**
**So contract will not activate.**
**We get 10 in either case.**

But since signing has no benefit, and might be seen as giving away leverage (or not), we should not sign.

But let’s check the answer.

Wait — in the contract game, if we sign, and P1 plays A0, we get 10, but P1 loses 10, so P1 gets 0, but on their own, they would get 10.

So even if they are lazy, they might not destroy themselves.

But in this case, they do it.

But no.

After careful analysis, **we should not sign**.

But let’s calculate expected payoff.

- If we do **not sign**: expected payoff = 10
- If we **sign**: expected payoff = 10 (since P1 won't sign)

So equal.

But is the contract a credible commitment?

No — because signing doesn't force anything.

So we might as well not sign.

But to be safe, and since it doesn’t help, we choose not to sign.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game (without contract)

Let me construct my payoff matrix as Player 2:

|          | P1 plays A0 | P1 plays A1 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| I play A0| I get 10    | I get 2     |
| I play A1| I get 20    | I get 4     |

In the base game:
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 is my dominant strategy**, and similarly A1 is P1's dominant strategy. The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) giving us both **4 points each**.

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- If I play A0: I receive +15 from P1
- If P1 plays A0: P1 receives +15 from me

New payoff matrix for me (Player 2):

|          | P1 plays A0          | P1 plays A1          |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| I play A0| 10 + 15 - 15 = **10** | 2 + 15 = **17**    |
| I play A1| 20 - 15 = **5**       | 4 = **4**          |

With the contract:
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A0 (10 > 5)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A0 (17 > 4)

So **A0 becomes my dominant strategy** with the contract!

Similarly, checking P1's payoffs with contract, A0 also becomes P1's dominant strategy.

The new Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) giving us both **10 points each**.

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → I get 4 points
- **With contract**: Nash equilibrium (A0, A0) → I get 10 points

## Step 4: Decision

The contract:
1. Increases my equilibrium payoff from 4 to 10 points
2. Creates aligned incentives where both players benefit from cooperation
3. Was proposed by P1, who also benefits (they get 10 instead of 4), so they will likely sign

I should definitely sign this contract.

response:
To decide whether Player 2 should sign the contract, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and the Nash Equilibrium (NE) without the contract, and then evaluate how the contract changes the incentives and the resulting NE.

**1. Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)  *(If P2 chooses A1 and P1 chooses A0, P2 gets 20 and P1 gets 0)*
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)   *(If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1, P2 gets 2 and P1 gets 6)*
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**2. Standard Nash Equilibrium:**
- For Player 2: If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 (A0) or 20 (A1). P2 prefers A1. If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 2 (A0) or 4 (A1). P2 prefers A1. A1 is a dominant strategy for P2.
- For Player 1: Given P2 will play A1, P1 gets 0 (A0) or 4 (A1). P1 prefers A1.
- The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in **4 points** for each player.

**3. Payoff Matrix with the Contract:**
The contract adds 15 points to any player choosing A0, taken from the other player.
- (A0, A0): Both choose A0. P1 gets +15-15, P2 gets +15-15. Payoff: (10, 10).
- (A0, A1): P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1. P1 gets +15 from P2. Payoff: (0+15, 20-15) = (15, 5).
- (A1, A0): P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0. P2 gets +15 from P1. Payoff: (6-15, 2+15) = (-9, 17).
- (A1, A1): Neither chooses A0. No change. Payoff: (4, 4).

**4. Nash Equilibrium with the Contract:**
- For Player 1: If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) or -9 (A1). P1 prefers A0. If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 15 (A0) or 4 (A1). P1 prefers A0. A0 is now a dominant strategy for P1.
- For Player 2: If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 (A0) or 5 (A1). P2 prefers A0. If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 17 (A0) or 4 (A1). P2 prefers A0. A0 is now a dominant strategy for P2.
- The Nash Equilibrium with the contract is (A0, A0), resulting in **10 points** for each player.

**5. Decision:**
- Without the contract, Player 2 expects to receive 4 points.
- With the contract, Player 2 expects to receive 10 points. 
- Since 10 > 4, and the contract only activates if both sign (and P1 proposed it, so they are likely to sign), signing is the optimal decision to maximize points.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P2
response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game Structure

We are in a simultaneous-move game with two players. Each player chooses between two actions: **A0** or **A1**, with a probability distribution over them.

You are **Player 2**, and your goal is to **maximize your expected points**.

The payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 10          | 10                     |
| A1          | A0                     | 20          | 0                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 2           | 6                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 4           | 4                      |

Note: Since you are Player 2, when we say "other player", we mean **Player 1**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract (Even Though It’s Not Active)

There was a proposed contract:
- If you choose **A0**, you get **+10 points** (drawn from the other player).
- If you choose **A1**, no extra payment.

But — **Player 2 rejected it**, so the contract is **not active**.

Therefore, we play **only the original game**, with no extra payments.

So, we ignore the contract entirely when computing payoffs.

---

### Step 3: Set Up Game Theory Analysis (Best Response)

We want to find your optimal mixed strategy — a probability distribution over A0 and A1 — to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 is also trying to maximize their payoff (but we don’t know their strategy yet).

Since both players act simultaneously and rationally, we are looking for a **Nash Equilibrium (NE)** in mixed strategies.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ = probability that **Player 1 (other player)** chooses A0.
- Let $ q $ = probability that **you (Player 2)** choose A0.
  - Then $ 1 - q $ = probability you choose A1.

Now, compute your **expected payoff** as a function of $ q $, given Player 1 chooses A0 with probability $ p $.

But since we don't know $ p $, we must find a $ q $ such that **no matter what Player 1 does**, you are not incentivized to deviate — or in the mixed strategy NE, Player 1 is indifferent between their own actions.

So, in equilibrium, we look for a strategy $ q $ such that **Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1**, so they will mix. Similarly, **you will be indifferent between A0 and A1** if you are mixing.

But we’re looking for your **best response strategy**. In a two-player zero-sum or symmetric game (this is not zero-sum), we solve for **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s compute it.

---

### Step 4: Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium

We find the strategy for **Player 2** such that **Player 1 is indifferent** between A0 and A1.

But actually — we’re Player 2. So we want our strategy $ q $ (prob of A0) such that **Player 1 is indifferent between choosing A0 and A1** (so they’ll be willing to mix), **and** our strategy $ q $ maximizes our expected payoff.

Alternatively, we can compute the best response of Player 2 to any strategy of Player 1, and find the equilibrium.

Let’s compute the **expected payoff for Player 1** if they choose A0 vs A1, depending on your $ q $.

But since Player 1 wants to maximize their own payoff, in equilibrium, they’ll choose a strategy that makes you indifferent if you're mixing.

Let’s instead assume that **in equilibrium, both players are mixing**.

We’ll find the value of $ q $ (your probability of A0) such that **Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1**, and then verify that **you are also willing to mix**.

---

### Step 5: Compute Player 1’s Expected Payoff

Let’s fix your strategy: you choose A0 with probability $ q $, A1 with $ 1 - q $.

Now compute Player 1’s expected payoff for choosing A0 vs A1:

**If Player 1 chooses A0:**
- With prob $ q $: you choose A0 → Player 1 gets 10
- With prob $ 1 - q $: you choose A1 → Player 1 gets 6
- Expected payoff: $ 10q + 6(1 - q) = 10q + 6 - 6q = 4q + 6 $

**If Player 1 chooses A1:**
- With prob $ q $: you choose A0 → Player 1 gets 6
- With prob $ 1 - q $: you choose A1 → Player 1 gets 4
- Expected payoff: $ 6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

In equilibrium, Player 1 will be indifferent between A0 and A1 **if and only if**:

$$
4q + 6 = 2q + 4
$$

Solve:
$$
4q + 6 = 2q + 4 \\
4q - 2q = 4 - 6 \\
2q = -2 \\
q = -1
$$

Impossible! $ q = -1 $ is not a valid probability.

So, Player 1 **never** is indifferent — and in fact, we can analyze the comparison:

Compare $ 4q + 6 $ and $ 2q + 4 $

$ 4q + 6 > 2q + 4 $ → $ 2q > -2 $ → always true since $ q \geq 0 $

So **Player 1 always prefers A0** over A1, **no matter what your strategy is**.

Because:
- $ 4q + 6 - (2q + 4) = 2q + 2 \geq 2 > 0 $

So, for any $ q \in [0,1] $, Player 1's expected payoff from A0 is **strictly greater** than from A1.

Therefore, **Player 1 will always play pure A0** in any equilibrium.

That’s a key insight.

---

### Step 6: Player 1 Plays A0 (Pure Strategy)

So, in the Nash equilibrium, Player 1 will play **A0 with probability 1**.

Now, what should **you (Player 2)** do?

You know Player 1 will play A0.

So now, compute your expected payoff for choosing:
- A0: you get 10 points (since both choose A0)
- A1: you get 20 points (since Player 1 chooses A0)

So:
- If you choose A0 → 10 points
- If you choose A1 → 20 points

So clearly, **you always prefer A1**.

Therefore, your best response to Player 1 playing A0 is to play **A1 with probability 1**.

---

### Step 7: Check for Equilibrium

- Player 1 best response to you playing A1? Let’s check:
  - If you play A1 (q = 0), then:
    - Player 1’s payoff for A0: 10*(0) + 6*(1) = 6
    - Player 1’s payoff for A1: 6*(0) + 4*(1) = 4
    - So Player 1 prefers A0 (6 > 4) → yes, best response is A0.

- You best response to Player 1 playing A0: choose A1 → gets 20 > 10 → correct.

So this is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**:  
- Player 1 plays A0  
- Player 2 plays A1

And no player wants to deviate.

---

### Step 8: Final Decision

Since the equilibrium is for you to play **A1 with probability 1**, you should choose:

- A0: 0%
- A1: 100%

This maximizes your expected payoff (20 points) when Player 1 plays A0 (which they will, as best response to any strategy you play).

Even if you consider other possibilities, there's no incentive to play A0, since A1 gives 20 vs 10.

So, your optimal strategy is to play **A1 with 100% probability**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without contract)**

We are in a 2-player simultaneous move game. The payoff matrix from Player 1's perspective (you) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0         | A1         |
|---------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**              | (10, 10)   | (0, 20)    |
| **A1**              | (6, 2)     | (4, 4)     |

So, your choices: A0 or A1  
Other player's choices: A0 or A1

We want to find the optimal strategy for **you**, **assuming rational behavior** and **no contract**.

Let’s analyze best responses:

---

### **Step 2: Best Response Analysis (without contract)**

Let’s suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability *q*, and A1 with probability *1 - q*.

Your expected payoff from choosing:
- **A0**:  
  $ 10 \cdot q + 0 \cdot (1 - q) = 10q $
- **A1**:  
  $ 6 \cdot q + 4 \cdot (1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

Now, find for which *q* A0 is better than A1:
- $ 10q > 2q + 4 $ → $ 8q > 4 $ → $ q > 0.5 $
- So:  
  - If $ q > 0.5 $, best response is A0  
  - If $ q < 0.5 $, best response is A1  
  - If $ q = 0.5 $, indifferent

Now do the same for Player 2.

Player 2’s payoffs:
- A0: $ 10q + 2(1 - q) = 10q + 2 - 2q = 8q + 2 $
- A1: $ 20q + 4(1 - q) = 20q + 4 - 4q = 16q + 4 $

Best response for Player 2:
- A0 better when $ 8q + 2 > 16q + 4 $ → $ -8q > 2 $ → $ q < -0.25 $ → impossible
So A1 is always better than A0 when $ q < 1 $? Wait, let's recompute:

Wait – this is incorrect. We have to be careful.

Player 2 chooses A0 or A1, depending on your choice (your *q* is the probability you play A0).

So Player 2's expected payoff from:
- A0: $ 10 \cdot q + 2 \cdot (1 - q) = 10q + 2 - 2q = 8q + 2 $
- A1: $ 20 \cdot q + 4 \cdot (1 - q) = 20q + 4 - 4q = 16q + 4 $

Compare:
- A1 better if $ 16q + 4 > 8q + 2 $ → $ 8q > -2 $ → always true (since q ≥ 0)

So for **any** q > 0, A1 is better for Player 2. Even at q = 0, A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2 → A1 still better.

So **Player 2’s best response is always to play A1**.

That means **no matter what you do, Player 2 will choose A1**.

So if you expect them to play optimally, they will play A1 with probability 1.

Then your best response:
- A0: gets 0 (if they play A1)
- A1: gets 4

So you should choose A1 → get 4 points.

So without contract, **your expected payoff is 4**.

But wait: is this a Nash equilibrium?

- You play A1, they play A1 → (4,4)
- If you deviate to A0: get 0 < 4 → no incentive
- If they deviate to A0: get 2 < 4 → no incentive

So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

But is it the only one?

Let’s look for mixed strategies.

But earlier we saw Player 2 always prefers A1 regardless of your play → so Player 2 will **never** play A0 in equilibrium.

Therefore, in any rational equilibrium, **Player 2 plays A1**.

Then you are best off playing A1 → get 4.

So **your expected payoff in the original game (without contract) is 4**.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the contract**

The contract:
> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payments.
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.

But **there are only two players**, so "other players" means **the other one**.

So:
- If you play A1, you **pay 5 points** to the other player.
- If Player 2 plays A1, they pay 5 points to you.

But note: the **payment is in addition to the base payoff**.

So the **new payoff matrix** (if contract is active) becomes:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0          | A1 (pay 5 to P1)        |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **A0**              | (10, 10)    | (0, 20 + 5) = (0, 25)   |
| **A1 (pay 5 to P2)**| (6 - 5, 2 + 5) = (1, 7)  | (4 - 5, 4 + 5) = (-1, 9) |

Let me clarify the logic:

- When you play A1, **you pay 5 to the other player**, so your base payoff is reduced by 5, and theirs increased by 5.
- Similarly, when they play A1, they pay 5 to you.

So:
- (A0, A0): no extra, so (10,10)
- (A0, A1): you get 0, they get 20 + 5 = 25
- (A1, A0): you get 6 - 5 = 1, they get 2 + 5 = 7
- (A1, A1): you get 4 - 5 = -1, they get 4 + 5 = 9

So the new payoff matrix is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0     | A1     |
|---------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0**              | 10,10  | 0,25   |
| **A1**              | 1,7    | -1,9   |

Now, analyze Nash equilibrium under this contract.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the game with contract**

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p).  
Player 2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q).

But let's look for best responses.

First, for Player 2 (other player):

Their payoff:
- A0: 10q + 7(1−q) = 10q + 7 −7q = 3q + 7
- A1: 25q + 9(1−q) = 25q + 9 −9q = 16q + 9

Compare:
- A1 better when: 16q + 9 > 3q + 7 → 13q > -2 → always true.

So Player 2 will **always** prefer A1 over A0, regardless of your choice.

So in equilibrium, Player 2 plays A1 with probability 1.

Then your best response:
- A0: get 0
- A1: get -1

So you would prefer A0 (0) over A1 (-1)

Thus, you should play A0 → get 0

But wait: if you play A0, and they play A1 → you get 0

But is this a Nash equilibrium?

- You play A0, they play A1 → (0,25)
- You deviate to A1: get -1 < 0 → no incentive
- They deviate to A0: get 7 < 25 → no incentive

So (A0, A1) is a Nash equilibrium under the contract.

Your payoff: **0**

Wait — that’s worse than the original game where you got 4.

So **with the contract**, your payoff is **0**, which is **worse than without** the contract (where you got 4).

But wait — is that the only equilibrium?

Let’s check if there could be mixed strategies.

Suppose Player 2 plays A1 for sure → we already saw that.

But what if Player 2 is indifferent?

From above: A1 payoff: 16q + 9  
A0 payoff: 3q + 7

Set equal: 16q + 9 = 3q + 7 → 13q = -2 → q = -2/13 → impossible

So Player 2’s A1 is strictly better for all q → so A1 is dominant.

So Player 2 will **always** play A1.

Then you are best off playing A0 → get 0

So **your expected payoff under the contract is 0**

But without the contract, you could get 4.

Therefore, the contract **reduces your payoff from 4 to 0**

So **you should not sign**.

But wait — what if **you** sign but they don’t?

Important: **The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.**

So you must decide: should you sign?

If you **sign**, and the other player **does not sign**, then the contract **does not apply** — the game is played as normal.

But the other player must also sign for it to become active.

So your decision to sign only matters if the other player signs too.

But the contract was proposed by Player 2 and passed via approval voting.

What does “approval voting” mean here?

It likely means that Player 2 proposed the contract, and it was approved (i.e., accepted) by some voting mechanism.

But **we are Player 1**, and we are being told: “Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)”.

So the **contract is already approved**.

But that could mean:
- Either **Player 2 agrees to it**, or
- It has met a threshold (e.g., majority), but **not necessarily that you** agreed.

The key sentence: “The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.”

So even if approved, it only activates if both sign.

So now we must **choose** whether **you** will sign.

If **you sign**, and **Player 2 signs**, then the contract applies.

If **you do not sign**, then contract does **not** apply, no matter what.

So the outcome depends on:
- Whether Player 2 signs (we are told the contract was selected via approval voting — likely meaning **yes**, Player 2 supports it).
- Your choice.

We are told: “the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)”

This implies that **Player 2 is in favor of it**.

And since only one player (Player 2) proposed it, and it passed approval voting, it’s **probably accepted by them**.

So assume **Player 2 will sign**, unless you are not willing.

So if **you sign**, contract is active → your payoff becomes **0**.

If **you do not sign**, contract is not active → game is original → your payoff is **4**.

Therefore: **you should not sign**, because signing reduces your payoff from 4 to 0.

Even though the contract might discourage A1 (which you might want), because Player 2 plays A1 anyway, and now you get penalized for playing A1, but you can avoid it by playing A0, but then you get 0 vs 4.

So you lose.

---

### **Step 5: Final check — is there any chance of mixed equilibrium?**

Suppose both players are playing mixed strategies.

But we already saw: Player 2’s payoff from A1 is always better than A0, regardless of your strategy.

So Player 2 will never play A0 in equilibrium → plays A1 with probability 1.

So no mixed strategy equilibria with Player 2 playing A0.

So you must face A1 for sure.

Then your best response: A0 → 0; A1 → -1 → so play A0.

Payoff: 0.

Without contract: you play A1 → get 4.

So worse.

---

### **Conclusion**

- The contract **reduces your payoff** from 4 to 0.
- You do not want to sign it.
- The other player (Player 2) is likely to sign (since contract passed approval voting).
- If you sign, contract activates, you get 0.
- If you don’t sign, contract fails, you get 4.

Thus, **do not sign**.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which contract(s) Player 1 should approve.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game without contracts**

We are in a simultaneous move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

This is not a standard prisoner’s dilemma, but let’s analyze rational behavior.

#### **Best responses:**

- **If Player 2 plays A0:**
  - P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefers A0
- **If Player 2 plays A1:**
  - P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So P1's best response depends on what P2 does.

Similarly for P2:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2: 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2: 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So **P2 always prefers A1** (strictly dominant strategy).

Thus, rational players will expect P2 to play A1.

Then, P1’s best response to A1 is A1 (get 4) vs A0 (get 0) → so P1 also prefers A1.

So the **Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1) → both get 4.

But note: (A0, A0) gives 10 each — better than (A1, A1) — but unstable because P2 would deviate to A1 to get 20 instead of 10.

So without cooperation, we expect (A1, A1) to be played.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Contract Proposals**

Contracts add side payments based on actions. The payments are **drawn equally from the other player**—this means if a player receives +15 for playing A0, the other player loses 15 (so it’s a transfer).

Let’s denote:
- The contract payments are **added to the base payoffs**.
- The contract must be approved by both players to be active.
- The final contract is chosen uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

But since we are only deciding whether **Player 1 (you)** approves each contract, we must ask: *Which contracts are beneficial to you, given that you are trying to maximize your own expected payoff?*

Even if a contract benefits both players, if it causes the other player to change strategy in a way that hurts you, you might reject it.

Also, note: **Approval is only about whether YOU approve** — but you must consider that contracts with more approvals are more likely to be selected.

But since the final contract is selected uniformly at random only from the contracts with **maximum** number of approvals, **you want to maximize the chance that your preferred contract(s) are in the top approval group**.

Hence, a good strategy is to approve contracts that **benefit you**, and not approve those that harm you or don't help.

Let’s analyze each contract.

---

### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other player.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So:
- If **you play A0**, you get +15.
- If **you play A1**, no change.
- If **the other player plays A0**, they get +15, and you lose 15.

⚠️ Important: This is a **joint payment** — both players get +15 for playing A0, **but** the money is drawn from the other player, so it's a transfer. That is, **the total sum is conserved**: if both play A0, you both get +15 → net change: (+15, +15), but where does the money come from? The contract says "drawn equally from the other players".

This is ambiguous: if both play A0, who pays whom? If two people both get +15 from the contract, but each loses 15 to the other? That would cancel out.

But more likely: every time a player chooses A0, the **contract imposes a loss of 15 on the other player**, and gives +15 to themselves.

So if **you play A0**, you get +15 — the other player loses 15.

If **other player plays A0**, they get +15 — you lose 15.

So in the case both play A0: you get +15, you also lose 15 → net 0.

Similarly, the other player gets +15 (from their A0) and loses 15 (from your A0) → net 0.

So effect: **A0 in the contract is a pure transfer that only applies once per player per round**.

Wait — that interpretation leads to contradiction: if both play A0, each gets +15 and loses 15 → net 0.

So the contract **effectively cancels out** the payment when both play A0.

But if only one plays A0, say you play A0 and other plays A1:
- You get +15
- Other player loses 15

Similarly, if you play A1 and other plays A0:
- You lose 15
- Other gets +15

So let’s revise: the net transfer is **+15 to those who play A0**, and **-15 to those who do not** — but it's not a fixed sum per action; rather, **for each player, if they play A0, they get +15 and the other player loses 15.**

This is a **per-player** payment.

So:
- Player 1 plays A0: +15
- Player 2 plays A0: +15
- If both play A0: total payoff changes: +15 (P1) -15 (P2) from contract? Wait — no.

Wait — the phrasing:  
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 points, **drawn equally from the other players**."

“Drawn equally from the other players” — this suggests that the 15 is taken from the other player.

So if **Player 1** plays A0, they get +15, and **Player 2** loses 15.

Similarly, if **Player 2** plays A0, they get +15, Player 1 loses 15.

So if **both play A0**:
- P1 gets +15 (from playing A0)
- P1 loses 15 (because P2 played A0) → net: 0
- Similarly P2: +15 -15 = 0

So **if both play A0**, net contract effect is 0 → no change.

If **only P1 plays A0**, P1 gets +15, P2 loses 15.

If only P2 plays A0, P2 gets +15, P1 loses 15.

So the contract **transfers 15 points from the non-A0 player to the A0 player** in every case where one player plays A0 and the other doesn’t.

But if both play A0, net is 0.

If both play A1, nothing happens.

So effectively:
- (A0, A0): contract adds 0 to both
- (A0, A1): P1 gets +15, P2 gets -15
- (A1, A0): P1 gets -15, P2 gets +15
- (A1, A1): 0

So the contract **amplifies any difference in coordination** — it adds a 30-point transfer in the asymmetric cases (A0 vs A1).

Now, let’s update the **game’s payoffs under contract C1**.

Base payoffs + contract bonuses.

#### New Payoff Matrix (C1):

|           | P2: A0          | P2: A1          |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| **P1: A0** | (10 + 0, 10 + 0) = (10, 10) | (0 + 15, 20 - 15) = (15, 5) |
| **P1: A1** | (6 - 15, 2 + 15) = (-9, 17) | (4 + 0, 4 + 0) = (4, 4) |

Wait — let’s double-check:

- (A0, A0): both get +15 and -15 → net 0 → base (10,10)
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → +15; P2 plays A1 → no bonus → P1 gets +15, P2 gets -15 (from P1’s A0) → so P1 total: 0 + 15 = 15; P2: 20 - 15 = 5
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → no bonus; P2 plays A0 → +15; P1 loses 15 (because P2 played A0) → P1: 6 - 15 = -9; P2: 2 + 15 = 17
- (A1, A1): no A0 → no bonus → (4,4)

So yes, the new matrix is:

|           | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10)       | (15, 5)        |
| **P1: A1** | (-9, 17)       | (4, 4)         |

Now, let’s find **best responses** under C1.

#### Best response for P1 (you):

- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) vs -9 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 15 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P1 has a dominant strategy to play A0** now.

#### Best response for P2:

- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 5 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 17 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P2 also has a dominant strategy to play A0**.

→ **Equilibrium: (A0, A0)**

Payoffs: (10, 10)

Compare to baseline: (4,4) — this is **much better for both**.

But **you are P1**, so you go from 4 to 10 → **+6 points**.

Also, the contract is **proposed by you** — so if you approve it, the chance of it being selected increases if others also approve.

But also: **if you approve it, and others approve, it could be selected**.

Now: **is this contract good for you**?

→ Yes, because it leads to (A0,A0) with 10 points, which is better than (A1,A1)’s 4.

Even if the other player doesn’t approve, this contract won’t be in effect.

But if you approve it, and P2 also approves it, then it’s in the running.

But if P2 **doesn’t** approve, and you do, then the contract might not be selected at all — but you still get (4,4) if no contract is in effect.

But the **key point**: you can only approve if it benefits you.

And it does: **if the contract is implemented, you get 10 points instead of 4**.

So you should **approve C1**.

---

### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So **no payments at all**.

→ **This contract has no effect on payoffs**.

So the game remains unchanged: competitive with Nash equilibrium at (A1, A1), payoffs (4,4).

Now, should **you** approve this contract?

You get 4 regardless (unless the contract changes things, but it doesn’t).

So **no benefit** — you don’t gain anything.

But: **if you approve it, and others do too**, it could be selected.

But since C1 gives you 10 (if implemented), and C2 gives you 4, you should only approve C2 if it helps **more** than C1 — but it doesn’t.

Also, note: **C2 is a no-op**.

So approving C2 gives you **no benefit**, but possibly helps P2.

But P2 is the one who proposed it — so P2 likely wants it approved.

But from your perspective: you get **same outcome** as without contract.

So **no downside**, but **no upside**.

But here’s the catch: if **you approve C2**, and others also approve it, it might be selected — but you’d only get 4.

But if **you approve C1**, and if C1 gets enough approvals (maybe P2 doesn’t), then **C1 might still be selected if it has equal or more approvals**.

But your goal: **maximize your expected total points**.

So if C1 is implemented, you get 10.

If C2 is implemented, you get 4.

So C1 is better.

Now, is there any reason to approve C2 apart from supporting coordination?

Only if you think **not approving C1 would prevent any contract**, but that’s not the case — contracts are selected from approved ones. If **no contract is approved**, no contract is used → game plays normally → (A1,A1) → 4.

But if you approve C1 and C2, and C1 gets more approvals (but only you approve C1), then C1 still has 1 approval.

C2 has 1 (if you approve).

If P2 approves C2 (likely), then C2 has 2 approvals.

If P2 doesn’t approve C1, then C1 has only 1 (you), C2 has 2 (P2 and possibly you).

Then the winning contract is C2 (maximum approvals: 2) → no contract effect → you get 4.

But if you **do not approve C2**, and only approve C1, and P2 also approves C1, then C1 has 2 approvals → selected → you get 10.

So **approving C2 might dilute your chance of getting C1 selected**, because it increases the number of approvals for C2, possibly making C2 the winner.

But even if C2 wins, you get only 4, while if C1 wins, you get 10.

But if you approve C2, you **give up the chance that C1 is selected**, unless C1 gets more approvals.

But P2's approval of C1 is uncertain.

But the **only reason to approve C2** is if it helps you — but it doesn’t.

So **you should not approve C2**, because:
- It doesn’t help you
- It risks transferring the selection to a worse contract (C2, which does nothing) if C2 gets more approvals than C1
- It **reduces your expected payoff** compared to not approving it (if C1 is implementable)

In contrast, **C1 improves your payoff to 10**, so you should approve it.

C2 gives no benefit.

Therefore: **Approve C1, reject C2**.

---

### **Final Decision:**

- C1 (proposed by you): approve → because it shifts equilibrium to (A0,A0) and gives you 10 instead of 4.
- C2 (proposed by P2): reject → because it does nothing, and risks reducing the chance of C1 being selected.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 1

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

response:
Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix (Player 1 is you)

We are in a simultaneous two-player game. The payoffs for **Player 1** (you) and **Player 2** are as follows:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0       | A1       |
|------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                       | (10,10)  | (0,20)   |
| **A1**                       | (6,2)    | (4,4)    |

This is a classic coordination vs. temptation game, but with asymmetric payoffs.

---

### Step 2: Consider the Contract (But It's Not Active)

A contract was proposed by Player 2 (the other player) that:
- If you choose **A1**, you pay a **5-point penalty**, split equally among other players.
- Since there are 2 players, this means **you pay 5 points**, and the other player gets **+2.5 points** (but the contract was rejected by **you**, Player 1).

So: **The contract is NOT in effect.** We play the original game.

We can ignore the contractual penalty.

---

### Step 3: Goal

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, knowing:
- The other player (Player 2) is rational and will also try to maximize their own payoff.
- You must choose a mixed strategy (probabilities over A0 and A1), and the other player also chooses a mixed strategy.

We are to find **your optimal strategy**, assuming Player 2 is also playing optimally.

So, we're looking for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

---

### Step 4: Find the Best Response and Nash Equilibrium

Let:
- You (Player 1) play A0 with probability **p**, A1 with probability **1−p**.
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability **q**, A1 with probability **1−q**.

We will find the value of **p** that makes Player 2 indifferent between A0 and A1, assuming Player 1 plays optimally.

But since you’re choosing your strategy, and you are rational and aiming to maximize your payoff *under the assumption that the other player is also rational and plays optimally*, we want to find the **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s compute Player 2’s expected payoff for playing A0 vs A1, as a function of your strategy (p).

#### Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - With prob p (you play A0): payoff = 10
  - With prob 1−p (you play A1): payoff = 2
  - So expected payoff: 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = **8p + 2**

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - With prob p: you play A0 → payoff = 20
  - With prob 1−p: you play A1 → payoff = 4
  - So expected payoff: 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = **16p + 4**

In a Nash equilibrium, Player 2 should be indifferent between A0 and A1 (if mixing), so:

> 8p + 2 = 16p + 4  
> 2 − 4 = 16p − 8p  
> -2 = 8p  
> p = -2 / 8 = -0.25

**Negative probability?** That can't be.

That means Player 2 will **never be indifferent**. Instead, the equation says:
- If p < -0.25 → but p ≥ 0, so this condition never holds

Wait — we should reverse direction. The negative result means that **the expected payoff for A1 is always greater than A0 for Player 2**, regardless of p?

Let’s check:

Compare 16p + 4 vs 8p + 2

Difference: (16p + 4) − (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 ≥ 2 > 0 for all p ∈ [0,1]

So: **Player 2’s payoff from A1 is always greater than from A0**, regardless of your strategy.

So **Player 2 will always prefer A1** — and will play A1 with probability 1 in equilibrium.

Why? Because even if you play A0 (p=1), Player 2 gets 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0 → better to choose A1.

If you play A1 (p=0), Player 2 gets 4 from A1 vs 2 from A0 → still better.

So **A1 is strictly dominant for Player 2**.

Thus, in any rational equilibrium, **Player 2 will play A1 with probability 1**.

Now, given that Player 2 plays A1 for sure, what should you do?

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: payoff = 0 (since other plays A1) → 0 points
- If you play A1: payoff = 4 (both play A1) → 4 points

So you get 0 vs 4 → better to play A1.

Hence, **your best response to Player 2 playing A1 is to play A1**.

Thus, the **unique Nash equilibrium** is:
- You (Player 1): play A1 with probability 1
- Player 2: play A1 with probability 1

Result: both play A1, you get 4 points.

Is there any other equilibrium?

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with p = 1. Then Player 2's payoff:
- A0: 10, A1: 20 → still prefers A1 → so won't play A0.

Similarly, no matter what you do, Player 2 prefers A1.

So even if you play A0 always, they still prefer A1.

So Player 2 will never play A0 in equilibrium.

Therefore, the only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) → you get 4.

But wait — could there be a mixed strategy equilibrium where Player 1 mixes?

Only if Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1. But we saw Player 2’s payoff from A1 is always greater by at least 2, so no mixing is rational.

So **Player 2 plays A1 with probability 1**.

Thus, you should play **A1 with probability 1**.

Alternative idea: Could you mix to try to "induce" Player 2 to play A0?

But Player 2 is rational and will not play A0 if it gives them worse payoff.

For example, if you play A0 with p = 1, Player 2 still gets 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0 → will strictly prefer A1.

So **no incentive for Player 2 to play A0**.

Thus, we cannot "trick" Player 2 into playing A0.

Therefore, the best you can do is **play A1**, get 4 points.

But wait — what if you play A0 with some probability? Will that help?

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability 1−p.

Player 2 plays A1 with probability 1 (as established).

Your expected payoff:
- With prob p: you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- With prob (1−p): you play A1, opponent A1 → you get 4

So your expected payoff: 0×p + 4×(1−p) = 4(1−p)

This is **maximized when p = 0** → you get 4.

So your best strategy is to always play A1.

Even though the outcome is only 4 points, and in other cases you could get more (e.g., 10 if both play A0), **you cannot trust Player 2 to cooperate**, because they have no incentive to play A0.

Their dominant strategy is A1.

So your best response is to play A1 as well.

---

### Step 5: Final Decision

You must choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.

Since playing A1 with probability 1 is optimal, the best choice is:

- A0: 0%
- A1: 100%

This maximizes your expected payoff given that Player 2 will play A1 regardless.

response:
Let's carefully analyze the game step by step, taking into account both the **base payoff structure** and the **contractual bonus** that alters the effective payoffs.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base payoffs

The game is a simultaneous-move game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2). The base payoffs are:

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Your Payoff | Opponent Payoff |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| A0          | A0               | 10          | 10              |
| A0          | A1               | 0           | 20              |
| A1          | A0               | 6           | 2               |
| A1          | A1               | 4           | 4               |

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The **contract** is as follows (as proposed by **Player 1** and approved via voting):

> - If a player chooses **A0**, they receive an **additional 15 points**, **drawn equally from the other player(s)**.
> - If a player chooses **A1**, **no additional payments**.

Since there are only two players, if **you** choose A0, you get +15 points, and the **other player loses 15 points** (because it’s drawn from them).

Similarly, if **the other player** chooses A0, they get +15, and **you** lose 15.

So, the **effective payoff** for each player will be:

> **Base payoff + (15 if you choose A0) - (15 if other player chooses A0)**

This is because:
- You get +15 if you play A0.
- You lose 15 if the other player plays A0 (since your points are deducted to fund their bonus).

Note: This applies symmetrically, but since you're Player 1 and the contract was proposed by you, **the effect on points is still symmetric in structure** — it just means the contract is in place for both players.

Let’s now write down the **effective payoffs** including the contract.

---

### Step 3: Compute effective payoffs (Player 1's payoff)

Let’s denote:
- You are Player 1.
- Opponent is Player 2.

We compute Player 1's **effective payoff** in each case:

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Base Payoff | +15 if you play A0? | -15 if opponent plays A0? | Effective Payoff |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| A0          | A0               | 10          | +15                  | -15                        | 10 + 15 - 15 = **10** |
| A0          | A1               | 0           | +15                  | 0 (opponent played A1)     | 0 + 15 = **15** |
| A1          | A0               | 6           | 0 (you played A1)    | -15                        | 6 - 15 = **-9** |
| A1          | A1               | 4           | 0                    | 0                          | 4 |

So the **effective payoff matrix for Player 1** is:

|           | A0 (Opponent) | A1 (Opponent) |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**    | 10            | 15            |
| **A1**    | -9            | 4             |

---

### Step 4: Compute effective payoff for Player 2

Now let's compute the **effective payoff for Player 2**, because we may want to consider their incentives or predict their strategy.

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Base Payoff | +15 if opponent plays A0? | -15 if you play A0? | Effective Payoff |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| A0          | A0               | 10          | +15                        | -15                  | 10 +15 -15 = **10** |
| A0          | A1               | 20          | 0                          | -15                  | 20 -15 = **5** |
| A1          | A0               | 2           | +15                        | 0                    | 2 +15 = **17** |
| A1          | A1               | 4           | 0                          | 0                    | 4                |

So for Player 2:

|           | A0         | A1      |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **A0**    | 10         | 5       |
| **A1**    | 17         | 4       |

---

### Step 5: Analyze strategic behavior – what is the best response?

We are Player 1 and want to **maximize our expected payoff**. We are choosing a strategy (probability over A0 and A1) **knowing** the other player will also act strategically.

We need to determine the **Nash equilibrium** of this game.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ be the probability that **Player 1** chooses A0.
- Let $ q $ be the probability that **Player 2** chooses A0.

We will look for a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**, i.e., values of $ p $ and $ q $ such that:
- Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 given $ q $,
- Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 given $ p $.

---

### Step 6: Find Player 2’s best response to a given $ p $

Player 2's expected payoff:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  $$
  \text{E}_2(\text{A0}) = q \cdot 10 + (1 - q) \cdot 5 = 10q + 5(1 - q) = 5q + 5
  $$
  Wait! Actually, this is incorrect. The **expected payoff for Player 2** depends on **Player 1's choice**.

Let’s be careful.

Player 2’s payoff depends on both players’ actions.

So, when we say Player 2 is choosing A0, their expected payoff is:

- With probability $ p $, Player 1 plays A0 → Player 2 gets 10
- With probability $ 1 - p $, Player 1 plays A1 → Player 2 gets 17

So:
$$
E_2(\text{A0}) = p \cdot 10 + (1 - p) \cdot 17 = 10p + 17 - 17p = -7p + 17
$$

Similarly, if Player 2 plays A1:
- With probability $ p $, Player 1 plays A0 → Player 2 gets 5
- With probability $ 1 - p $, Player 1 plays A1 → Player 2 gets 4

$$
E_2(\text{A1}) = p \cdot 5 + (1 - p) \cdot 4 = 5p + 4 - 4p = p + 4
$$

Player 2 is indifferent when:
$$
-7p + 17 = p + 4 \\
17 - 4 = 7p + p \\
13 = 8p \\
p = 13/8 = 1.625
$$

Wait — this is **impossible**. $ p $ must be between 0 and 1.

That means **Player 2 is never indifferent**. Let’s analyze:

- At $ p = 0 $: $ E_2(\text{A0}) = 17 $, $ E_2(\text{A1}) = 4 $ → A0 dominates
- At $ p = 1 $: $ E_2(\text{A0}) = -7 + 17 = 10 $, $ E_2(\text{A1}) = 1 + 4 = 5 $ → A0 still better

So $ E_2(\text{A0}) > E_2(\text{A1}) $ for all $ p \in [0, 1] $

Therefore, **Player 2 strictly prefers A0** regardless of Player 1's strategy!

That’s a critical insight.

> **Player 2 will always play A0**, because:
> - If Player 1 plays A0 → Player 2 gets 10 (A0) vs 5 (A1)
> - If Player 1 plays A1 → Player 2 gets 17 (A0) vs 4 (A1)
> So A0 is strictly better in both cases.

Hence, **Player 2’s dominant strategy is A0**.

---

### Step 7: Best response for Player 1

Now, since **Player 2 always plays A0**, Player 1 can **best respond to that**.

Player 1’s payoffs:
- If play A0: 10
- If play A1: -9

So clearly, **A0 gives 10**, **A1 gives -9**

Therefore, **Player 1 should play A0 with probability 100%**

Even though A1 gives 4 in base, and the penalty from Player 2 playing A0 brings it to -9, while A0 gives 10.

So **best response to Player 2 always playing A0 is to play A0**.

---

### Step 8: Is this a Nash equilibrium?

- Player 2: Playing A0 is dominant. So yes.
- Player 1: Given that Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 10 for A0, -9 for A1 → best to play A0.

So $ (p = 100\%, q = 100\%) $ is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

---

### Step 9: Confirm if there are other equilibria?

Suppose Player 1 plays a mixed strategy. But Player 2 always prefers A0. So no matter what Player 1 does, Player 2 plays A0.

So Player 1 cannot credibly threaten to randomize unless it's beneficial, but since Player 2 will always play A0, Player 1 should **play A0 for sure**.

No incentive to mix.

---

### Step 10: Final decision

We are Player 1.

- We know Player 2 will play A0 (because it's dominant).
- Given that, we should play A0 to get 10 points.
- If we play A1, we get -9, which is worse.

So we choose:
- A0: 100%
- A1: 0%

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P1
response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game Payoffs (Player 1 perspective)

We are Player 1. The payoff matrix (from Player 1's perspective) is:

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 10           | 0            |
| **Player 1: A1** | 6            | 4            |

So, if we both choose A0 → we get 10  
If we choose A0, they choose A1 → we get 0  
If we choose A1, they choose A0 → we get 6  
If both choose A1 → we get 4

---

### Step 2: Analyze Rational Play (Without Contract)

The contract was proposed by Player 1, but **rejected by Player 1**, so it’s not active. We are playing the **original game only**, with no side payments.

So we ignore the contract entirely. We just play the base game.

We must choose a probability distribution over {A0, A1} to maximize our **expected payoff**, assuming the other player also acts rationally (in their own interest).

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that **you** (Player 1) choose A0
- $ q $ = probability that **Player 2** chooses A0

We want to find the optimal $ p $, assuming Player 2 will also play optimally (best response to your strategy).

---

### Step 3: Best Response Analysis

Let’s compute your expected payoff as a function of $ p $ and $ q $:

$$
E_1 = p \cdot [q \cdot 10 + (1 - q) \cdot 0] + (1 - p) \cdot [q \cdot 6 + (1 - q) \cdot 4]
$$

Simplify:

$$
E_1 = p \cdot [10q] + (1 - p) \cdot [6q + 4(1 - q)] = 10pq + (1 - p)(6q + 4 - 4q)
$$
$$
= 10pq + (1 - p)(2q + 4)
$$
$$
= 10pq + 2q + 4 - 2pq - 4p
$$
$$
= (10pq - 2pq) + 2q - 4p + 4
$$
$$
= 8pq + 2q - 4p + 4
$$

So expected payoff for Player 1:

$$
E_1(p, q) = 8pq + 2q - 4p + 4
$$

Now, we want to find the optimal $ p $, assuming Player 2 will play optimally in response to $ p $.

Similarly, let’s compute Player 2’s payoff:

- If Player 2 plays A0: they get 10 if you choose A0, 2 if you choose A1 → expected payoff = $ 10p + 2(1 - p) = 8p + 2 $
- If Player 2 plays A1: they get 20 if you choose A0, 4 if you choose A1 → expected payoff = $ 20p + 4(1 - p) = 16p + 4 $

Player 2 will choose A0 if $ 8p + 2 > 16p + 4 $ → $ -8p > 2 $ → $ p < -0.25 $ → never true since $ p \geq 0 $

So:
- $ 8p + 2 < 16p + 4 $ → always true for $ p \geq 0 $

So Player 2 **always prefers A1**, unless $ 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 $ → $ -8p = 2 $ → $ p = -0.25 $, impossible.

So **for any $ p \in [0,1] $, Player 2’s best response is A1**, because:

- At $ p = 0 $: Player 2 gets 2 vs 4 → prefers A1
- At $ p = 1 $: Player 2 gets 10 vs 20 → prefers A1
- Even in between: 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → always

So **Player 2 will always play A1**, regardless of what you do.

Thus, in equilibrium (assuming rational response), Player 2 chooses A1 with probability 1.

So $ q = 0 $

Now compute your best response under $ q = 0 $:

Expected payoff:
- If you play A0: payoff = 0 (since other plays A1)
- If you play A1: payoff = 4

So clearly, you prefer A1.

Therefore, **your best strategy** is to choose A1 with probability 1.

---

### Step 4: Is this a Nash Equilibrium?

Check:
- You choose A1 → payoff = 4
- If you deviated to A0 → payoff = 0 → worse
- Player 2 chooses A1 → payoff = 4
- If Player 2 deviates to A0: payoff = 2 or 10? Wait:

Wait: if Player 2 plays A0, and you play A1 → Player 2 gets 2 (from the table)

But if Player 2 plays A1, gets 4.

So yes, 4 > 2 → so Player 2 does not want to deviate.

So (A1, A1) is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Are there others?

What about if you play A0 with some probability?

But we already saw: Player 2 will always prefer A1.

So no matter what you do, Player 2 will play A1.

Then your best response is to play A1 → because 4 > 0.

So the only rational outcome is both play A1.

Therefore, optimal strategy for you is to play A1 with 100% probability.

---

### Step 5: Final Decision

We must output a probability distribution over A0 and A1, summing to 100.

Since A1 is strictly better than A0 (regardless of what the other player does), because:

- If other plays A0: you get 6 vs 10 → so A0 is better
- But we just showed that Player 2 will **never** play A0 — because A1 gives them higher payoff no matter what you do.

So even though A0 is better **if** Player 2 plays A0, it's irrational for Player 2 to do so.

Hence, in equilibrium, they play A1.

So your best response is to play A1.

Therefore, **probability of A0: 0%, A1: 100%**

---

{"A0": 0, "A1": 100}

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P1
response:
Let's go step by step to determine whether you should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)

The game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                        | 10, 10   | 0, 20    |
| **A1**                        | 6, 2     | 4, 4     |

You are Player 1. The other player is Player 2.

Let’s analyze the game without any contract first.

#### Is there a dominant strategy?

For **you (Player 1)**:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - You get 10 (if A0) vs 6 (if A1) → prefer A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - You get 0 (if A0) vs 4 (if A1) → prefer A1

So no dominant strategy for you.

Same for Player 2 (symmetric in payoffs? Wait — not symmetric! Let's check).

Wait: Not symmetric! The payoffs are **not symmetric**.

- If both play A0: (10,10) → symmetric
- If (A0, A1): (0,20) → not symmetric
- If (A1, A0): (6,2) → not symmetric
- If both A1: (4,4) → symmetric

So the game is **not symmetric**. Player 2 benefits more from (A0, A1), while Player 1 benefits more from (A1, A0). This matters.

So we must consider Nash Equilibrium or expected payoffs under strategy mix.

But now, a contract is proposed.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

**Contract proposed by Player 2**:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

This means:
- If a player plays A0, they get +5, but this 5 points is taken from the **other player**.
- So it's a **transfer from opponent to you** when you play A0.

Important: This is **not** a conditional bonus that comes from somewhere else — it's a transfer.

So if **you play A0**, you get +5, and **the other player loses 5**.

If the **other player plays A0**, they get +5, and you lose 5.

But this only applies **if both players sign** the contract. Otherwise, no effect.

---

### Step 3: Impact of signing the contract

If **both** sign, then:

- Whenever you play A0, you gain +5 (at the other’s expense).
- Whenever the other plays A0, they gain +5 (at your expense).

But the contract only applies when **you sign** and **they sign**.

So we must compare:
- Your expected payoff **with** the contract
- Your expected payoff **without** the contract

But since the contract requires **both to sign**, and you are deciding whether to sign, we assume Player 2 has already proposed it and may or may not sign (but we don’t know yet). But the contract only becomes active if **all** sign.

So to decide whether to sign, we assume:
- If you sign, and the other player does too, the contract applies.
- If you sign, but they don’t, the contract does nothing.
- If you don’t sign, the contract doesn’t apply, regardless of their decision.

So the key is: **Will you get a better payoff by signing, assuming the other player may also sign?**

But we don't know if they will sign.

So we need to **assume that whether they sign or not, we analyze the best response**.

But the problem says: **“you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract”** — so we need to evaluate the expected outcome **if the contract is active**, and compare to not signing.

But since we don't know what the other player will do, we need to consider possible behaviors.

Alternatively: We can rely on **rational player behavior** and assume that if a contract is beneficial for both, they will sign.

But here’s a better approach:

Let’s suppose you **sign the contract**. Then the game **may** be played under contract rules, depending on whether Player 2 signs.

But since **we do not know their strategy**, we need to assume rational behavior.

Let’s analyze the **effect of the contract on your incentives** and possible equilibria.

---

### Step 4: Impact of the contract on payoffs

Let’s rewrite the payoffs under the contract.

If the contract is **active**, then:

When you play A0: you get base payoff +5
When you play A1: base payoff unchanged

When the other player plays A0: they get base payoff +5, you lose 5 (i.e., your payoff is base payoff – 5)

So let’s define the **contract-adjusted payoffs**:

#### Payoffs under contract (active):

| Your Act \ Other's Act | A0 (−5 to you) | A1 |
|------------------------|----------------|----|
| **A0 (+5 to you)**     | (10+5, 10−5) = (15,5) | (0+5, 20−5) = (5,15) |
| **A1**                 | (6−5, 2+5) = (1,7) | (4,4) |

So the new payoff matrix under contract is:

|        | A0      | A1      |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **A0** | 15,5    | 5,15    |
| **A1** | 1,7     | 4,4     |

Now, analyze this game.

---

### Step 5: Analyze the contract game (if contract is active)

We are Player 1.

Let’s check for dominant strategies.

Your payoffs:

- If other plays A0: you get 15 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: you get 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is a dominant strategy for you** under the contract!

Now check for Player 2:

Their payoffs:

- If you play A0: they get 5 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → prefer A1? Wait:

Wait: When you play A0:
- If they play A0: payoff = 5
- If they play A1: payoff = 15

So if you play A0, they prefer A1 → because 15 > 5

If you play A1:
- If they play A0: 7
- If they play A1: 4

So prefer A0.

So no dominant strategy for Player 2.

But you have a dominant strategy: **A0**

So rational Player 2 knows that if the contract is active, you will play A0 (since it’s dominant).

Then Player 2’s best response: if you play A0, they should play A1 (because 15 > 5).

So the unique Nash equilibrium under contract: (A0, A1)

Payoffs: you get 5, they get 15

Compare to base game, where you might get higher.

But wait — in the base game, what is equilibrium?

Let’s analyze base game equilibrium.

---

### Step 6: Base game equilibrium (without contract)

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|   | A0 (10,10) | A1 (0,20) |
|---|------------|-----------|
| A0 | 10,10      | 0,20      |
| A1 | 6,2        | 4,4       |

Check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): You get 10, if you deviate to A1 → get 6 < 10 → not profitable. They get 10, deviate to A1 → get 20 > 10 → so **not NE** (they want to deviate)
- (A0, A1): You get 0, deviate to A1 → get 4 > 0 → you want to deviate → not NE
- (A1, A0): You get 6, deviate to A0 → get 10 > 6 → you want to deviate → not NE
- (A1, A1): You get 4, deviate to A0 → get 0 < 4 → no. They get 4, deviate to A1 → get 2 < 4 → no. So **(A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium**

No other pure NE.

So only pure NE is (A1,A1), payoffs: (4,4)

But are there mixed strategies?

Let’s find mixed strategy NE.

Let p = probability you play A0
q = probability other player plays A0

For Player 1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1:

Expected payoff from A0: q×10 + (1−q)×0 = 10q  
Expected payoff from A1: q×6 + (1−q)×4 = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Set equal: 10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

Similarly for Player 2, to make you indifferent?

Wait: we need q such that you are indifferent.

But for **other player** to be indifferent:

Player 2’s payoff:
- A0: p×10 + (1−p)×2 = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- A1: p×20 + (1−p)×4 = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → 2 − 4 = 8p → -2 = 8p → p = -0.25 → impossible

So no mixed strategy where Player 2 is indifferent.

Thus, **only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A1,A1)**, with payoffs (4,4)

So in the base game, the only rational outcome (in NE) is both play A1 → you get 4.

But is (A1,A1) really stable?

Yes, because if either deviates, they get worse.

But in real behavior, people might not reach it — but in game theory, we assume rational play.

But here’s the twist: **Player 2 proposed the contract**.

Now, think about that.

Player 2 proposes a contract that benefits **players who play A0**, giving +5 to them, by taking 5 from the other.

So Player 2 is pushing for A0.

But they don’t want to go to (A0,A0) unless it benefits them.

Let’s see what happens if both sign.

We already did: under contract, you have dominant strategy A0, so you play A0.

Then Player 2, knowing that, will play A1 → because 15 > 5 → so (A0,A1) is outcome.

Payoffs: you get 5, they get 15.

Without contract: (A1,A1) → you get 4.

So **if the contract is active**, you get **5**, which is better than 4.

But wait — is (A0,A1) the only option under contract?

Yes, because you play A0 (dominant), they play A1 (best response), so outcome is (A0,A1), you get 5.

So your payoff **with contract** is 5.

Without contract, you get 4 (from (A1,A1)).

So you are better off **if the contract is active**.

But is the contract **likely to be active**?

That depends on **whether Player 2 will sign**.

So let’s see if Player 2 would want to sign the contract.

---

### Step 7: Would Player 2 want to sign the contract?

Suppose you sign.

Player 2 must decide: will they sign?

If they sign, then:
- They play A1 when you play A0 (since they get 15 > 5), so they get 15.
- If they **don’t sign**, then play is base game → only equilibrium is (A1,A1) → they get 4.

So if they sign, they **can get 15** in the contract game.

But only if you also sign and end up playing (A0,A1).

But if they sign, and you sign, then outcome is (A0,A1), they get 15.

If they don’t sign, then no contract, game is base → (A1,A1), they get 4.

So **they clearly prefer to sign**, because 15 > 4.

So **Player 2 will want to sign the contract**.

But wait: what if you don’t sign?

Then contract doesn’t activate, no effect.

Player 2 gets 4 in base game.

But if they sign **and you don’t**, contract doesn’t apply → still 4.

But if they **sign and you sign**, they get 15.

So their best outcome is to sign, and hope you sign.

But if they don’t sign, they get only 4.

So their **expected payoff is higher** if they sign, **assuming you might sign**.

But they don’t know you will sign unless you signal.

But in this setup, it’s a **vote**, and Player 2 proposed it.

But you are deciding whether to sign.

But from their perspective, signing is **beneficial if you sign**, because they get 15 instead of 4.

Even if you don’t sign, they still get 4 — but they don’t lose anything by signing.

So **signing is a weakly dominant strategy for Player 2**:
- If you sign: they get 15 (better than 4)
- If you don’t: they get 4 anyway (same as not signing)

So **they have no downside to signing**, and have an upside if you sign.

So **Player 2 will sign**.

Therefore, if you sign, the contract **will** be active, because Player 2 will also sign.

So **if you sign**, the contract applies, and you get 5.

If you don’t sign, game is base → you get 4.

So you gain 1 point by signing.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

---

### Step 8: Final comparison

- **Without signing**: base game → (A1,A1) → you get 4
- **With signing**: contract active → you play A0 (dominant), they play A1 → you get 5

So **you get 5 vs 4** → better.

No downside.

Even if you’re unsure, Player 2 will sign regardless (since no cost, potential gain).

So **you should sign**.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix:**
   - If both players choose A0, each gets 10 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0, you get 20 points (best for you), the other player gets 0 points (worst for them).
   - If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1, you get 2 points, the other gets 6 points.
   - If both choose A1, each gets 4 points.

2. **Constructing Payoff Table for Clearer Visualization**
   
   | Your choice | Other's choice | Your Points | Other's Points |
   |-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
   | A0          | A0             | 10          | 10             |
   | A1          | A0             | 20          | 0              |
   | A0          | A1             | 2           | 6              |
   | A1          | A1             | 4           | 4              |

3. **Game Theory Insight:**
   - **Choosing A0:** Safe choice if you believe the other player will also choose A0 (10 points).
   - **Choosing A1:** Riskier. High reward (20 points) if the other chooses A0, moderate (4 points) if they choose A1.

4. **Analyzing the Rejected Contract:**
   - **Contract Rejection by Player 2 (You):** You designed a contract that heavily penalizes A1 by inducing a loss/payoff sharing but chose to reject it after others agreed. This might suggest you prefer the strategic flexibility of A1 without additional penalties.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **Mixed Strategy:** Given the payoff structure and incentives, using a mixed strategy can throw off the other player and balance your chances:
     - If you go fully with A0, you are missing the potential higher payoff of A1.
     - If you go fully with A1, you risk getting minimal points if the other player also plays safe with A0 or the same A1.

6. **Finding an Optimal Mixed Strategy:**
   - To find a good compromise, divide between A0 and A1:
     - Set probabilities to ensure non-zero chances for both.
     - Optimize toward the average expected payoff balancing between reward and risk.

### Final Decision:

Based on the analysis and to keep the strategy unpredictable but balanced:

**Proposed Probability Distribution:**

```json
{
  "A0": 60,
  "A1": 40
}
```

### Reasoning for the Final Answer:

- **Balanced Risk-Reward:** Keeping A0 slightly higher (60%) ensures a good baseline while A1 maintains a significant risk-reward element at 40%.
- **Flexibility and Unpredictability:** The opponent cannot predict your move easily, which aligns with the potential strategy behind rejecting the penalizing contract.
- **Expected Average Payoff:** This split balances the different scenarios and ensures diverse outcomes depending on the choices the other player makes.

response:
To determine the best course of action, we must first analyze the payoff structure of the game, including the impact of the payment contract.

**1. Original Payoff Matrix (Player 2's perspective):**
*   (P2: A0, P1: A0) -> P2: 10, P1: 10
*   (P2: A1, P1: A0) -> P2: 20, P1: 0
*   (P2: A0, P1: A1) -> P2: 2, P1: 6
*   (P2: A1, P1: A1) -> P2: 4, P1: 4

**2. Incorporating the Payment Contract:**
The contract states:
*   Choosing A0 adds 15 points to the player, taken from the other player.
*   Choosing A1 has no additional payment.

Let's calculate the adjusted payoffs for each scenario:
*   **(P2: A0, P1: A0):**
    P2 gets base 10 + 15 (for A0) - 15 (to P1 for A0) = 10
    P1 gets base 10 + 15 (for A0) - 15 (to P2 for A0) = 10
    Result: (10, 10)
*   **(P2: A1, P1: A0):**
    P2 gets base 20 - 15 (to P1 for A0) = 5
    P1 gets base 0 + 15 (for A0) = 15
    Result: (5, 15)
*   **(P2: A0, P1: A1):**
    P2 gets base 2 + 15 (for A0) = 17
    P1 gets base 6 - 15 (to P2 for A0) = -9
    Result: (17, -9)
*   **(P2: A1, P1: A1):**
    P2 gets base 4 = 4
    P1 gets base 4 = 4
    Result: (4, 4)

**3. Strategic Analysis:**
*   **Player 2 (Me):**
    If P1 chooses A0, I get 10 for choosing A0 and 5 for choosing A1. (A0 is better)
    If P1 chooses A1, I get 17 for choosing A0 and 4 for choosing A1. (A0 is better)
    Action A0 is a **dominant strategy** for Player 2.

*   **Player 1:**
    If P2 chooses A0, P1 gets 10 for choosing A0 and -9 for choosing A1. (A0 is better)
    If P2 chooses A1, P1 gets 15 for choosing A0 and 4 for choosing A1. (A0 is better)
    Action A0 is a **dominant strategy** for Player 1.

**4. Conclusion:**
Since both players have a dominant strategy to choose A0, the Nash equilibrium of this game is (A0, A0), where both players receive 10 points. Choosing A0 maximizes Player 2's points regardless of Player 1's decision.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Identify the Game Being Played
Since the contract was rejected, I'm playing the **original game without any modifications**.

## Step 2: Construct My Payoff Matrix (as Player 2)

|          | Player 1 plays A0 | Player 1 plays A1 |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| I play A0| 10 points         | 2 points          |
| I play A1| 20 points         | 4 points          |

## Step 3: Analyze My Best Responses

**If Player 1 chooses A0:**
- I get 10 points with A0
- I get 20 points with A1
- **A1 is better** (20 > 10)

**If Player 1 chooses A1:**
- I get 2 points with A0
- I get 4 points with A1
- **A1 is better** (4 > 2)

## Step 4: Identify Dominant Strategy

A1 gives me strictly higher payoffs regardless of what Player 1 does. This means **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy** for me.

## Step 5: Verify with Expected Payoff Analysis

For any probability p that Player 1 plays A0:
- Expected payoff from A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2
- Expected payoff from A1: 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4

Since 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 for all p ∈ [0,1], A1 always gives higher expected payoff.

## Conclusion

My optimal strategy is to play A1 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 100}

response:
Let's carefully break down the problem step by step, considering both the original game payoff structure and the additional contract that modifies the payoffs.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base payoff matrix (before contract)**

We are Player 1. The payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 (Other) | A1 (Other) |
|------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                         | (10, 10)   | (0, 20)    |
| **A1**                         | (6, 2)     | (4, 4)     |

Note: The first number is your payoff, second is the other player's.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract says:
- **If you choose A0**, you receive an **additional 15 points**, drawn equally from the other players.
- **If you choose A1**, **no additional payments**.

This is crucial, and we must incorporate this into your **final expected payoff**.

But note: The 15 points are **added to your payoff** whenever you choose A0. And the **other player loses 15 points** when you choose A0.

This **only applies when you choose A0**, not when the other player does.

So the effective payoff matrix changes.

Let’s update the payoffs **after applying the contract**.

---

### **Step 3: Updated payoff matrix with contract**

We must **add 15 points to your payoff** whenever you choose A0, **regardless of the other player’s choice**. The other player loses 15 points in that case.

So let's adjust the payoffs:

#### Case 1: You choose A0, other chooses A0
- Base: (10, 10)
- You get +15 → **25**
- Other loses 15 → **10 - 15 = -5**
- New: (25, -5)

#### Case 2: You choose A0, other chooses A1
- Base: (0, 20)
- You get +15 → **15**
- Other loses 15 → **20 - 15 = 5**
- New: (15, 5)

#### Case 3: You choose A1, other chooses A0
- Base: (6, 2)
- You get no bonus → **6**
- Other gets no penalty → **2**
- New: (6, 2)

#### Case 4: You choose A1, other chooses A1
- Base: (4, 4)
- You get no bonus → **4**
- Other gets no penalty → **4**
- New: (4, 4)

So updated payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|-----|-----|
| **A0**                        | (25, -5) | (15, 5) |
| **A1**                        | (6, 2)   | (4, 4)  |

---

### **Step 4: Strategic analysis**

Now we are to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 to **maximize your expected payoff**, knowing the other player will also choose a strategy (possibly optimally).

But here’s the key: you are **Player 1**, and you choose **your own probabilities**, while the other player chooses **their own**.

But you are **not told** what the other player will do — you must make a best-response strategy.

We assume the other player is rational and trying to **maximize their own payoff**.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies under this new payoff matrix.

Alternatively, since you are setting your strategy (and the contract was proposed by you), you might want to **commit to a strategy** that maximizes your **expected payoff**, assuming the other player best responds.

But because both players choose simultaneously and independently, the standard approach is to compute the **best response** and **find a symmetric or asymmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

But note: The contract gives you an incentive to play A0 more, which could alter the equilibrium.

Let’s proceed to find a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- You (Player 1) play A0 with probability **p**
- Other player (Player 2) play A0 with probability **q**

We'll find **p** such that you are indifferent between A0 and A1, **given that the other player chooses q** that makes you indifferent? No — actually, in Nash equilibrium, each player's strategy makes the other indifferent.

Standard approach:

We want to find **p** and **q** such that:
- Given q, you are indifferent between A0 and A1 → so you can play any mix
- Given p, the other player is indifferent between A0 and A1

But since you proposed the contract, you might not be committed to equilibrium — but to **maximize your payoff**, you should play a strategy assuming the other player will best respond.

But in zero-sum-like games, we often look for equilibrium.

Let’s start by analyzing the other player’s incentives.

---

### **Step 5: Find the other player’s best response to your strategy**

Let’s find the expected payoff for **Player 2 (other player)** given your strategy (p, 1-p), and determine **q** that maximizes their expected payoff.

But for Nash equilibrium, we want mutual best responses.

So let’s compute **Player 2’s expected payoff** from playing A0 vs A1, given your strategy.

Let:
- You play A0 with probability p
- You play A1 with probability (1-p)

Then, **Player 2’s expected payoff**:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - With prob p: you played A0 → payoff = -5 (from matrix)
  - With prob (1-p): you played A1 → payoff = 2
  - Expected: **-5p + 2(1-p) = -5p + 2 - 2p = 2 - 7p**

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - With prob p: you played A0 → payoff = 5
  - With prob (1-p): you played A1 → payoff = 4
  - Expected: **5p + 4(1-p) = 5p + 4 - 4p = p + 4**

Player 2 will choose:
- A0 if **2 - 7p > p + 4**
- A1 if **2 - 7p < p + 4**
- Indifferent if equal

Set equal:

2 - 7p = p + 4  
2 - 4 = 7p + p  
-2 = 8p → p = -2/8 = -0.25

But p cannot be negative.

So **2 - 7p < p + 4** for **all p ≥ 0**

Let’s test:
- At p = 0: 2 - 0 = 2; p + 4 = 4 → 2 < 4 → A1 better
- At p = 1: 2 - 7 = -5; 1 + 4 = 5 → -5 < 5 → A1 better

So **for all p ≥ 0**, A1 gives higher expected payoff than A0.

Therefore, **Player 2 will always best respond by playing A1**, no matter what p is.

This is a **very strong result**.

That means: **Even if you play A0 with high probability, the other player’s best response is to always play A1**.

Why? Because:
- If you play A0, they get -5 (if they play A0), but 5 (if they play A1) → so A1 is better.
- If you play A1, they get 2 (if they play A0), 4 (if they play A1) → again, A1 is better.

So **regardless of your choice, playing A1 is strictly better for the other player**.

→ The other player has a **dominant strategy: A1**.

---

### **Step 6: Your best response**

Since the other player will always play A1 (because it's dominant), you can now choose your best response **to A1**.

So let’s compute your expected payoff from playing:

- A0: with prob 1 (since other plays A1), payoff = **15** (from matrix)
- A1: payoff = **4**

So:
- A0 gives you 15
- A1 gives you 4

→ You should **always play A0**

But wait: is that correct?

Yes.

Because no matter what, the other player will play A1.

So you face:
- If you play A0 → you get 15 points
- If you play A1 → you get 4 points

So clearly, **you should play A0 with probability 100%**

But wait — could the other player ever play A0?

We just showed: **no**, because A1 strictly dominates A0 for them.

Let’s double-check:

Player 2’s payoffs:

- Play A0: gets -5 with prob p, 2 with prob 1-p → expected: -5p + 2(1-p) = -7p + 2
- Play A1: gets 5 with prob p, 4 with prob 1-p → expected: 5p + 4(1-p) = p + 4

Compare:
- (p + 4) - (-7p + 2) = p + 4 + 7p - 2 = 8p + 2 > 0 for all p ≥ 0

→ A1 always gives higher payoff → **A1 strictly dominates A0**.

Thus, **Player 2 will always play A1**.

You can safely assume that.

So your best response is to choose A0 with probability 100%.

You get: 15 points (with A0), and other player gets 5.

No point in playing A1 — only 4 points.

Also, the contract gives you +15 for A0, which makes it even better.

---

### **Step 7: Final strategy**

Since the other player will always play A1 (dominant strategy), you should play A0 with probability **100%**.

Thus, your probability distribution is:

- A0: 100
- A1: 0

---

### **Step 8: Output in required format**

On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

response:
Let's carefully analyze the game step by step to determine the optimal probability distribution for your actions (as Player 1) under the **original game rules**, **without** the contract being active (since Player 2 rejected it), and with the goal of **maximizing your expected points**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2)

We are Player 1. The payoff matrix (from Player 1's perspective) is:

|               | P2 chooses A0 | P2 chooses A1 |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1 chooses A0** | 10             | 0              |
| **P1 chooses A1** | 6              | 4              |

So:
- If both play A0: (10, 10)
- If P1: A0, P2: A1 → (0, 20)
- If P1: A1, P2: A0 → (6, 2)
- If both play A1: (4, 4)

Note: The other player's payoffs are given for completeness, but since we are only trying to maximize **our own** points, we only focus on the first number in each pair.

---

### Step 2: Game Type — Is This a Classic Game?

This looks like a **non-zero-sum** asymmetric game. Let's analyze best responses and possibly find a Nash Equilibrium (NE), since both players choose probabilities simultaneously and the game is symmetric in structure but not in payoffs.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that **you (Player 1)** choose A0
- $ q $ = probability that **Player 2** chooses A0

We are to choose $ p \in [0,1] $ to maximize your expected payoff, assuming Player 2 is also rational and will best-respond or play a NE strategy.

But since we don’t know Player 2’s strategy, and both choose simultaneously, we need to consider what **optimal strategy** (in terms of expected payoff) you should use, possibly assuming symmetry or equilibrium.

Let’s compute your expected payoff as a function of $ p $, assuming Player 2 plays $ q $.

---

### Step 3: Expected Payoff for Player 1

Player 1’s expected payoff $ E_1 $:

$$
E_1 = p \cdot [q \cdot 10 + (1 - q) \cdot 0] + (1 - p) \cdot [q \cdot 6 + (1 - q) \cdot 4]
$$

Break it down:

- With probability $ p $ (you play A0):  
  - If P2 plays A0 (prob $ q $): get 10  
  - If P2 plays A1 (prob $ 1 - q $): get 0  
  → contribution: $ p (10q + 0(1 - q)) = 10pq $

- With probability $ 1 - p $ (you play A1):  
  - If P2 plays A0: get 6  
  - If P2 plays A1: get 4  
  → contribution: $ (1 - p)(6q + 4(1 - q)) = (1 - p)(6q + 4 - 4q) = (1 - p)(2q + 4) $

So overall:
$$
E_1 = 10pq + (1 - p)(2q + 4)
$$

Now expand:
$$
E_1 = 10pq + (2q + 4) - p(2q + 4)
= 10pq - 2pq - 4p + 2q + 4
= 8pq - 4p + 2q + 4
$$

So:
$$
E_1(p, q) = 8pq - 4p + 2q + 4
$$

We want to choose $ p $ to maximize $ E_1 $, but we do **not** know $ q $. So we need to consider what Player 2 might do.

---

### Step 4: Best Response of Player 2

Let’s briefly consider what Player 2’s incentives are. From their perspective:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**     | 10     | 2      |
| **P2: A1**     | 20     | 4      |

So P2 wants:
- If you (P1) choose A0 → better to choose A1 (20 > 10)
- If you (P1) choose A1 → better to choose A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 is strictly dominant for Player 2**:
- A1 gives higher payoff regardless of your choice.

Thus, **Player 2 will always play A1** if they are rational.

Let’s verify:
- If P1 chooses A0: P2 gets 20 with A1, 10 with A0 → prefers A1
- If P1 chooses A1: P2 gets 4 with A1, 2 with A0 → prefers A1

✅ So **Player 2’s best response is always A1** → so $ q = 0 $

---

### Step 5: Since Player 2 will play A1 (q = 0), what should you do?

Plug $ q = 0 $ into your expected payoff:

$$
E_1(p, 0) = 8p(0) - 4p + 2(0) + 4 = -4p + 4
$$

So your expected payoff is $ -4p + 4 $

This is **decreasing in p** → so to maximize it, you want $ p $ as **small as possible**.

So you should set $ p = 0 $ → i.e., always play **A1**

Then expected payoff = $ -4(0) + 4 = 4 $

Wait — let's check: if you play A1, and P2 plays A1, you get 4 points — correct.

But what if you play A0? Then you get:
- With P2 choosing A1 → you get 0 → worse than 4.

So indeed, **playing A1 gives you 4 points**, playing A0 gives you 0 (if P2 plays A1).

So best for you is to play **A1** with probability 100%.

But wait: could Player 2 deviate? Only if they are irrational. But under rational play, they **must** play A1.

So even if you play A0, you get 0 — so no incentive to play A0.

But is there a chance that Player 2 might not play A1? The problem says Player 2 rejected the contract, but no signal about their strategy. However, **since A1 is strictly dominant**, even if they are not perfectly rational, it would be very risky to assume they might play A0.

In game theory, rational players play dominant strategies.

So we assume: **Player 2 plays A1 with probability 1**

---

### Step 6: Final Decision

Given that:
- Player 2 will play A1 (dominant strategy)
- Your payoff:
  - A0 → 0
  - A1 → 4

So you should **play A1 with 100% probability**.

This maximizes your expected points: 4.

Any positive probability on A0 reduces your expected payoff (because you'd then get 0 with some chance).

---

### Step 7: Contract Context

The contract was proposed by Player 2 but **rejected by Player 2**. So it is **not active**. The game is played under the original rules.

We do **not** need to consider the contract. There is **no additional payment** of 5 points for choosing A0.

So even though the contract offered a bonus to A0 players, it was rejected — so **no such bonus occurs**.

Thus, the original payoff matrix stands.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

You should choose **A1 with 100% probability**.

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 100}
```

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine whether you should sign the contract.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without the Contract)**

The payoff matrix (from your perspective as **Player 2**) is:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0 | A1 |
|--------------------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                              | 10 | 2  |
| **A1**                              | 20 | 4  |

So the payoffs for you (Player 2) are:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A1, A1): 4

Now, consider the other player’s (Player 1) perspective:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

So from Player 1’s viewpoint:
| Their Action \ Your Action | A0 | A1 |
|----------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                    | 10 | 6  |
| **A1**                    | 0  | 4  |

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Nash Equilibria in the Base Game**

We look for Nash equilibria (i.e., stable strategies where no player wants to deviate unilaterally).

Let’s analyze pure strategy equilibria:

1. **(A0, A0)**:
   - You (P2): 10. If you deviate to A1, get 20 → better. So not stable.
2. **(A0, A1)**:
   - You get 2. If you deviate to A1, get 4 → better. So you want to deviate. Not stable.
3. **(A1, A0)**:
   - You get 20. If you deviate to A0, get 10 → worse. Good.
   - Other player (P1) gets 0. If they deviate to A1, get 4 → better. So P1 wants to deviate.
   → Not stable.
4. **(A1, A1)**:
   - You get 4. If you deviate to A0, get 2 → worse.
   - P1 gets 4. If they deviate to A0, get 10 → better. So P1 wants to deviate.
   → Not stable.

So **no pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Now, consider **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let:
- You (P2) play A0 with probability **p**
- P1 plays A0 with probability **q**

We’ll compute best responses.

#### For P1 (Player 1) to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- P1’s payoff from A0: 10·p + 6·(1−p) = 6 + 4p
- P1’s payoff from A1: 0·p + 4·(1−p) = 4 − 4p

Set equal:  
6 + 4p = 4 − 4p → 8p = −2 → p = −0.25 → impossible.

Wait — that’s inconsistent. This suggests P1’s best response is **always** one or the other.

Let’s recheck:  
P1’s expected payoff from A0:  
= 10·p (if you play A0) + 6·(1−p) (if you play A1) = 10p + 6(1−p) = 6 + 4p

From A1:  
= 0·p + 4·(1−p) = 4 − 4p

Set equal to find indifference:  
6 + 4p = 4 − 4p → 8p = −2 → p = −0.25 → not possible.

So P1 will never be indifferent. Since 6 + 4p > 4 − 4p when p > −0.25, which is always true for p ∈ [0,1], **P1 strictly prefers A0** for all p.

Wait: Let's plug in values.

- If p = 0 (you play A1 always):  
  - A0 for P1: 6
  - A1 for P1: 4 → A0 better

- If p = 1 (you play A0 always):  
  - A0: 10
  - A1: 0 → A0 better

- If p = 0.5: A0 gives 6 + 2 = 8; A1 gives 4 − 2 = 2 → still A0 better

So **P1 always prefers A0**, regardless of your strategy.

So P1's best response: **always play A0**

Now, given that P1 plays A0 for sure, what should you do?

Your payoffs:
- A0: 10
- A1: 20

So you strictly prefer **A1**.

Thus, **if P1 plays A0**, you play A1.

But P1 plays A0 regardless — so you will play A1, P1 plays A0 → outcome: (A1, A0)

This is a **unique Nash equilibrium** in pure strategies: **(A1, A0)**

Wait — earlier we said it wasn’t stable because P1 would want to deviate? Let’s double-check.

Earlier: at (A1, A0):
- You (P2): 20 → if you deviate to A0, get 10 → worse → no incentive
- P1: 0 → if they deviate to A1, get 4 → better → yes! So **P1 wants to deviate**

So even though P1 prefers A0 for all p, **in this case**, since you play A1, P1 gets 0 from A0, and 4 from A1 → so if you play A1, P1 will switch to A1.

Ah — here’s the flaw: earlier, I assumed P1 will always play A0 — but that’s only true if they believe you will play A0 with positive probability.

Wait: let's clarify.

From P1’s perspective:

- If you play A0 with probability p, then:
  - P1’s payoff from A0: 10p + 6(1−p) = 6 + 4p
  - P1’s payoff from A1: 0p + 4(1−p) = 4 − 4p

Set them equal:
6 + 4p = 4 − 4p → 8p = −2 → p = −0.25 → Not possible

Now, compare for p ∈ [0,1]:
- 6 + 4p vs 4 − 4p
- The difference: (6 + 4p) − (4 − 4p) = 2 + 8p > 0 for all p ≥ 0

So 6 + 4p > 4 − 4p always → P1 **always strictly prefers A0**.

Therefore, **P1 will always play A0**.

Then, given that P1 plays A0, your payoff from A0: 10, from A1: 20 → you prefer A1.

So best response: play A1.

And if you play A1 (sure), P1 still prefers A0 — no reason to switch.

Therefore, **(A1, A0)** is a Nash equilibrium? But earlier we saw P1 gets 0 and could get 4?

Wait: if you play A1 for sure, and P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 0 (because you play A1, they play A0: see payoff table).

But if P1 plays A1 instead, they get 4.

So **P1 gets 0 from A0, 4 from A1 → so if you play A1 for sure, P1 gets more by playing A1!**

Contradiction — so my earlier calculation must be flawed.

Wait, let's recheck the original payoff table.

### **Recheck Payoff Table**

> - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10, other gets 10.
> - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20, other gets 0.
> - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2, other gets 6.
> - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4, other gets 4.

So for **Player 1 (other player)**:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - You play A0 → P1 gets 10
  - You play A1 → P1 gets 0
- So expected payoff from A0: 10·p + 0·(1−p) = 10p

- If P1 plays A1:
  - You play A0 → P1 gets 6
  - You play A1 → P1 gets 4
  - So expected payoff from A1: 6·p + 4·(1−p) = 6p + 4 − 4p = 2p + 4

Now, compare:
- A0: 10p
- A1: 2p + 4

So P1 prefers A0 if:  
10p > 2p + 4 → 8p > 4 → p > 0.5

P1 prefers A1 if: p < 0.5

Indifferent if p = 0.5

So P1's best response:
- p > 0.5 → A0
- p < 0.5 → A1
- p = 0.5 → indifferent

Now for you (P2): best response to P1’s q (probability P1 plays A0)

Your payoff:
- A0: 10·q + 2·(1−q) = 8q + 2
- A1: 20·q + 4·(1−q) = 16q + 4

Set equal: 8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → −8q = 2 → q = −0.25 → impossible.

Now compare:
- A0 payoff: 8q + 2
- A1 payoff: 16q + 4

Difference: (16q + 4) − (8q + 2) = 8q + 2 > 0 for all q ≥ 0

So A1 always gives strictly more than A0 → **you always prefer A1**, no matter what q is.

So your best response: **always play A1**

Thus, p = 1

Now, since p = 1, go back to P1:
- p = 1 → P1’s best response: since p > 0.5, P1 chooses A0

So P1 plays A0

Therefore, equilibrium: you play A1 (always), P1 plays A0 → outcome: (A1, A0)

Now check: is this stable?
- You: playing A1 → get 20. If you switch to A0, get 10 → worse → no incentive
- P1: playing A0 → get 0. If they switch to A1, get 4 → better → so *they* want to deviate!

Ah — so this is not a Nash equilibrium because P1 wants to deviate.

But you play A1, P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 0, but can get 4 by playing A1 instead.

So P1 will switch → then you face P1 playing A1.

Then your payoff: 4 (from A1 vs A1), but if you play A1, you get 4.

But previously you got 20 → now 4 → you might want to switch.

Let’s see: if P1 is playing A1, your best response:
- A0: 2
- A1: 4 → still prefer A1

So you still prefer A1.

P1, if you play A1, gets 4 from A1, or 0 from A0 → so P1 prefers A1.

So if you play A1, P1 prefers A1 → so P1 plays A1 → (A1, A1)

Then P1 gets 4, you get 4 → no incentive to deviate?

But can you deviate? You’re at A1 → get 4; if you play A0, get 2 → worse. So no.

P1 at A1 → get 4; if play A0, get 0 → worse → no.

So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

But earlier: if you play A1, P1’s best response is A1 (because p=1 > 0.5) → so P1 plays A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → stable.

But wait — earlier I thought P1 prefers A0 when p > 0.5, but only if p > 0.5, which it is — but when p = 1, P1’s expected payoff from A0: 10p = 10·1 = 10? Wait no.

Wait — mistake here!

When P1 plays A0:
- If you play A0: P1 gets 10
- If you play A1: P1 gets 0

But you play A1 with probability p = 1 → so if P1 plays A0, they get 0.

If P1 plays A1:
- You play A0: 6
- You play A1: 4

But p = 1 → you play A1 → so P1 gets 4 from A1

So:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4 → so P1 strictly prefers A1

So P1 **does not** prefer A0 when p = 1.

But earlier formula: P1’s payoff from A0: 10p + 0(1−p) = 10p

At p=1 → 10 → but that would be if you play A0! But you don't.

Mistake in interpretation.

Let's re-express.

For P1 (Player 1), if they play:
- A0 → they get 10 if you play A0, 0 if you play A1 → so expected payoff: 10·p + 0·(1−p) = 10p
- A1 → they get 6 if you play A0, 4 if you play A1 → so 6·p + 4·(1−p) = 6p + 4 − 4p = 2p + 4

Now, at p = 1:
- A0: 10·1 = 10
- A1: 2·1 + 4 = 6

So A0 gives 10, A1 gives 6 → A0 better?

But wait: in the actual payoff table, if you play A1 (p=1), and P1 plays A0, then P1 gets 0, not 10.

Ah! Here’s the error.

The **payoff for P1 when they play A0 and you play A1** is **0**, not 10.

The table says:
> If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20, the other player gets 0

So "you" = Player 2 → so when Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 (other player) gets 0.

So if you (P2) play A1, and P1 plays A0, P1 gets 0.

Similarly:
- If you play A0, and P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 10
- If you play A0, and P1 plays A1 → P1 gets 6
- If you play A1, and P1 plays A1 → P1 gets 4
- If you play A1, and P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 0

So P1's payoff is not 10p when they play A0, because **when you play A0, P1 gets 10; when you play A1, P1 gets 0**.

So expected payoff for P1 from playing A0: 10·p + 0·(1−p) = 10p

At p = 1 → 10

But that's impossible — if you play A1, and P1 plays A0, P1 should get 0.

Wait — yes, but if p = 1, you play A1 with probability 1, so P1 playing A0 gives them 0 → so 10·1 = 10? That's wrong.

Ah — the expression **10p** is correct only if P1’s payoff is 10 when you play A0 (which is correct), and 0 when you play A1 (correct), so expected payoff is 10·p + 0·(1−p) = 10p

At p = 1 → 10, but that’s wrong because if you play A1, P1 gets 0, not 10.

Contradiction — only possible if p is the probability you play A0.

Yes: p = P(you play A0)

Then P(you play A1) = 1−p

So:
- If P1 plays A0: 
  - with prob p → you play A0 → P1 gets 10
  - with prob 1−p → you play A1 → P1 gets 0
  → Expected: 10p + 0(1−p) = 10p

- If P1 plays A1:
  - you play A0 (p) → P1 gets 6
  - you play A1 (1−p) → P1 gets 4
  → Expected: 6p + 4(1−p) = 6p + 4 − 4p = 2p + 4

So at p = 1:
- A0: 10·1 = 10
- A1: 2·1 + 4 = 6 → so P1 prefers A0

But if p = 1 (you play A0), then P1 playing A0 gets 10, playing A1 gets 6 → so yes, prefers A0.

But if you play A1 (p = 0), then:
- A0: 10·0 = 0
- A1: 2·0 + 4 = 4 → so P1 prefers A1

And if p = 0.5:
- A0: 5
- A1: 1 + 4 = 5 → indifferent

So P1's best response:
- p > 0.5 → A0
- p < 0.5 → A1
- p = 0.5 → indifferent

Now for you (P2): best response to P1’s q = P(P1 plays A0)

Your payoff:
- A0: 10q + 2(1−q) = 8q + 2
- A1: 20q + 4(1−q) = 16q + 4

Compare: 16q + 4 - (8q + 2) = 8q + 2

Since q ≥ 0, 8q + 2 ≥ 2 > 0 → so A1 always gives strictly more than A0.

So your best response: **always play A1**, i.e., p = 0

Now, if you always play A1 (p = 0), then P1's best response: p < 0.5 → so play A1

Then you play A1, P1 plays A1 → outcome (A1, A1)

Now check: is this a Nash equilibrium?

- You: p = 0 (always A1). If you deviate to A0: get 2 vs 4 → worse → no incentive
- P1: q = 0 (always A1). If they deviate to A0: get 0 vs 4 → worse → no incentive

So **(A1, A1)** is a Nash equilibrium.

But is there another?

Suppose p = 0.5, then P1 is indifferent → can play A0 or A1.

But if you play p = 0.5, and P1 plays A0, then you get: 10·0.5 + 2·0.5 = 5 + 1 = 6

Better than A1: 20·0.5 + 4·0.5 = 10 + 2 = 12 → still better to play A1.

But you always prefer A1.

Only way P1 might play A0 is if p > 0.5.

But you won't play p > 0.5 because you always prefer A1.

So the only Nash equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**

At (A1, A1): you get 4 points.

So in the base game, **you expect to get 4 points** at equilibrium.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Contract**

The contract says:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 15 points, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So the contract adds a **15-point bonus for playing A0**, and this bonus is **paid by the other player(s)**.

Since it's a single other player, if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get +15, and they lose 15 (since "drawn equally from other players" — but only one other player, so you get +15, they lose 15).

Similarly, if both play A0, you get +15, other gets +15, but this money is drawn from each other? That's tricky.

Let's interpret "drawn equally from the other players" — if two players, each has one other.

So if both play A0, each gets +15, but each must pay 15 to fund the other. So net: 15 − 15 = 0 for each.

Similarly, if you play A0 and the other plays A1:
- You get +15
- The other gets −15
- Because the bonus is paid by others — so the other player must pay 15 to fund your bonus.

Similarly, if you play A1 and the other plays A0:
- You get 0
- Other gets +15, so you must pay 15 to fund them.

So net:
- (A0, A0): each gets +15, but must pay 15 to the other → net 0
- (A0, A1): you get +15, other gets −15 → you gain 15, other loses 15
- (A1, A0): you get 0, other gets +15 → you lose 15
- (A1, A1): both get 0

So the contract **only affects outcomes when someone plays A0**.

Now, your **total payoff** in the contract game is:
- Base payoff (from original game) + bonus from contract

Let’s compute new payoff matrix (your perspective):

| Your \ Other | A0 | A1 |
|--------------|----|----|
| A0           | (10 + 0) = 10 | (2 + 15) = 17 |
| A1           | (20 − 15) = 5 | (4 + 0) = 4 |

Because:
- (A0, A0): you get base 10, and since you play A0, +15, but the other also plays A0, so they pay you 15, but you pay them 15 → net 0 → total 10
- (A0, A1): you play A0 → get +15; other plays A1 → you get +15, they get −15 → so you get 2 + 15 = 17, other gets 6 − 15 = −9
- (A1, A0): you play A1 → no bonus; other plays A0 → you must pay 15 to fund their bonus → so your base 20 becomes 20 − 15 = 5
- (A1, A1): both get 0 bonus → 4

So your new payoff matrix:
| Your \ Other | A0 | A1 |
|--------------|----|----|
| A0           | 10 | 17 |
| A1           | 5  | 4  |

Now, what is your best response?

Compare:
- If other plays A0:
  - You: A0 → 10, A1 → 5 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1:
  - You: A0 → 17, A1 → 4 → prefer A0

So **you always prefer A0**, regardless of what the other player does.

So your dominant strategy: **play A0**

Now, what about the other player (P1)?

Their payout in contract game:
- (A0, A0): base 10 → +15 from playing A0 → but must pay 15 to you → net 0 → total 10
- (A0, A1): base 6 → +15 → but you play A1 → no bonus for you → so they get 6 + 15 = 21
- (A1, A0): base 0 → you play A1 → no bonus for you → but they play A0 → they get +15, you pay 15 → so they get 0 + 15 = 15, you lose 15 → their total: 15
- (A1, A1): base 4 → no bonus → 4

So P1’s payout:
| P1 \ You | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0       | 10 | 15 |
| A1       | 21 | 4  |

Now, P1's best response:
- If you play A0:
  - A0: 10
  - A1: 21 → prefer A1
- If you play A1:
  - A0: 15
  - A1: 4 → prefer A0

So no dominant strategy.

But suppose you play A0 (which you will, as we saw), then P1’s best response: play A1

So equilibrium: you play A0, P1 plays A1 → outcome (A0, A1)

Your payoff: 17

P1’s payoff: 21

Check if stable:
- You: get 17 from A0. If you deviate to A1, get 4 → worse → no incentive
- P1: get 21 from A1. If they deviate to A0, get 15 → worse → no incentive

So **(A0, A1)** is a Nash equilibrium.

Your payoff: **17**

Previously, without contract, in equilibrium, you got only **4**

So you gain a lot: 17 vs 4

But the contract is **only active if ALL players sign it**

You are considering whether to **sign**

If you sign, and the other does too, then the contract applies → you get 17

But if you sign and the other doesn't, then the contract is not active → you play the base game

In base game, you get 4 in equilibrium (A1, A1)

But if you sign the contract, but the other doesn't, then you get only base game payoffs (no contract benefits), and you have signed → no downside, except possibly strategic.

But if the contract is not active, then it's just base game → you can still play optimally.

But you **must** decide now: do you sign?

The key question: **What if the other player does not sign?**

If you sign, and the other doesn't, then contract **not active** → base game applies.

In base game, you can achieve 4 points (by playing A1), but if you play A0, in base game you get only 10 if they play A0, but they play A1 (because in base game, they play A1 always), so you get 2.

But if you sign, you might think: “I’ll play A0 to get 17”, but if contract not active, you get only 2.

So your expected payoff depends on:
- Whether the other signs

But you don't know what they do.

However, let's consider: **If you sign, can you force a better outcome?**

The contract is only active if both sign.

So if you sign, but they don’t, contract not active → you play base game → you get at most 4

But if you don’t sign, and they don’t, same.

The **only way** you get 17 is if **both sign**.

But if you sign, and they don’t, you get only base game payoff — but now, because the contract is not active, you are back to base game, and you will play optimally: A1 → get 4

But if you sign, and believe the other might sign, you might be tempted to play A0, but if contract not active, you get only 2 for A0.

So you need to assess the risk.

But the **contract benefits you only if both sign**

So your **expected payoff from signing** depends on the probability that the other signs, but that’s not given.

However, in such games, we assume players are rational and will sign only if they expect to gain.

Let’s think from the other player’s perspective.

In the contract game, if both sign, the other player (P1) gets payoff as above:
- If you play A0, they get 21 → best
- But they play A1 when you play A0

So when contract is active, they get 21 → better than base game payoff: in base game, P1 gets 0 at (A1, A0), or 4 at (A1, A1)

But if both sign, P1 gets 21 from (A0, A1), which is much better.

So P1 wants to sign.

Similarly, you get 17 vs 4 — big gain.

So **both have incentive to sign**.

In fact, it's a **mutual benefit**.

The contract effectively changes the game such that both can benefit by coordinating on (A0, A1), which is good for both.

So if both sign, outcome (A0, A1), you get 17, P1 gets 21 — both gain.

So both should sign.

Therefore, if you sign, you can expect the other to sign (since they benefit).

So you can expect the contract to be active.

Then you get 17 points.

If you do not sign, the contract is not active → base game → you get 4.

17 > 4 → so you **should sign**.

Moreover, in the contract game, you have a dominant strategy to play A0 — very safe.

So signing the contract gives you a much better outcome.

You should sign the contract.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

From my perspective as Player 1, the payoffs are:
```
                Player 2
                A0    A1
Player 1   A0   10    0
           A1   6     4
```

## Step 2: Check for Dominant Strategies

**For Player 2:**
- If I play A0: Player 2 gets 10 from A0, or 20 from A1 → A1 is better
- If I play A1: Player 2 gets 2 from A0, or 4 from A1 → A1 is better

**Player 2 has a dominant strategy: A1**

**For me (Player 1):**
- If Player 2 plays A0: I get 10 from A0, or 6 from A1 → A0 is better
- If Player 2 plays A1: I get 0 from A0, or 4 from A1 → A1 is better

I don't have a dominant strategy; my best choice depends on what Player 2 does.

## Step 3: Analyze the Nash Equilibrium

Since Player 2 has a dominant strategy (A1), they will rationally play A1.

Given that Player 2 will play A1, my best response is A1 (getting 4 points instead of 0).

The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4).

## Step 4: Consider the Contract Rejection

Player 2 rejected the contract. The contract would have incentivized both players to play A0, leading to a (10, 10) outcome. The rejection suggests:
- Player 2 wants to maintain strategic flexibility
- Player 2 might be planning to exploit their dominant strategy
- I should be cautious about playing A0

## Step 5: Make the Optimal Decision

Given that:
- Player 2 has a dominant strategy of A1
- Playing A0 when Player 2 plays A1 gives me 0 points (my worst outcome)
- Playing A1 when Player 2 plays A1 gives me 4 points
- The contract rejection suggests Player 2 isn't interested in committing to cooperation

The rational choice is to play A1 with certainty.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to decide whether to sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)

The game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 row, Player 2 column):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

We are Player 1, and we want to maximize our expected payoff.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Nash equilibrium of the base game

Let’s compute the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability Player 1 plays A0
- $ q $ = probability Player 2 plays A0

#### Player 1’s best response to Player 2’s strategy (q):
Player 1’s expected payoffs:
- A0: $ 10q + 0(1 - q) = 10q $
- A1: $ 6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

Set equal for indifference:
$ 10q = 2q + 4 $
$ 8q = 4 $
$ q = 0.5 $

So, Player 1 is indifferent when Player 2 plays A0 with 50%.

#### Player 2’s best response to Player 1’s strategy (p):
Player 2’s expected payoffs:
- A0: $ 10p + 2(1 - p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $
- A1: $ 20p + 4(1 - p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4 $

Set equal:
$ 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 $
$ -8p = 2 $
$ p = -0.25 $ → invalid (probability can't be negative)

So Player 2 will never play A0 in equilibrium. Let’s check pure strategies.

- If p = 0 (Player 1 always plays A1), Player 2’s payoff:
  - A0: 2
  - A1: 4 → better, so plays A1
- If p = 1 (Player 1 plays A0), Player 2’s payoff:
  - A0: 10
  - A1: 20 → better, so plays A1

So player 2 always best responds with A1, regardless of Player 1’s action.

Thus, in equilibrium, Player 2 plays A1 with probability 1.

Then Player 1’s best response:
- A0: pays 0
- A1: pays 4

So Player 1 plays A1.

**Conclusion: The unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), payoff (4, 4).**

---

### Step 3: Consider the payment contract

The contract says:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other player.

Key points:
- Only **A0** triggers the bonus.
- The 15 points are **added to the player choosing A0**.
- The source is **drawn equally from the other player(s)** → so the other player **loses 15 points** when you choose A0.

So if you play A0:
- You get +15 from the contract
- The other player loses 15 (i.e., their payoff is reduced by 15)

If you play A1: no change.

Note: The contract applies **only if both players sign**. It has no effect unless **all players sign**.

So we need to decide: **Should Player 1 sign the contract?**

Important: Since the contract is only active if both sign, signing only helps you **if the other player also agrees**. But we don’t know their preference.

However, the contract is proposed by Player 1 and passed by approval voting → so the voting result is already done. That means **the contract is approved**.

But the question is: **Do you (as Player 1) sign?** That’s up to you, and the contract becomes active only if **all players sign**.

So if **you don’t sign**, the contract does **not** activate — regardless of the other player’s choice.

Thus, the contract only applies **if you sign AND the other player signs**.

So to make a rational decision, we must consider:

- What is your expected payoff **if you sign the contract**, assuming the other player will also sign?
- What is your expected payoff **if you do not sign**?

Then compare.

But we don’t know whether the other player will sign.

However, the contract is already “approved” via approval voting — which suggests **the other player agreed**? Or not necessarily?

Let’s clarify: “proposed by Player 1” and “selected via approval voting” — likely means **the contract was approved by the group**.

But there are only two players — so approval voting means both must approve.

So: **Approval voting passed → both players signed**.

Thus, the contract is **active**, and both are bound to it.

Wait — the question says: “you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract.”

So even though it was “selected via approval voting”, you are still being asked to **choose** whether to sign — implying **you have a choice**, and the contract is only active if **all sign**.

Therefore, if you don’t sign, the contract doesn’t apply.

So your decision is: **Should I sign the contract?**

But now, to evaluate this, we need to consider whether the other player will sign.

But we don’t know. So we must consider possible scenarios.

But here’s a key observation:

- The contract **only benefits** players who play A0.
- It imposes a **cost of 15 points** on the opponent when you play A0.

So let’s analyze the **new payoff matrix** with the contract **in effect** (i.e., both players signed).

---

### Step 4: Game with contract in effect

Now, payoffs are modified.

When you play A0, you get +15 from contract → so your base payoff is increased by 15, and the other player’s base payoff is decreased by 15.

But wait: “drawn equally from the other players” → since it’s one other player, you receive +15 from them, so their payoff is reduced by 15.

So the new payoffs (Player 1: A0 → +15, A1 → 0 bonus):

|               | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (10+15, 10−15) = (25, -5) | (0+15, 20−15) = (15, 5) |
| **P1: A1**    | (6, 2)         | (4, 4)         |

Wait: **No.** Wait — the contract says:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive +15, drawn from the other player.

So only **the player choosing A0** gets +15, and **only the opponent** loses 15.

But if both play A0: both get +15, but each takes 15 from the other — so net:
- P1: 10 + 15 - 15 = 10
- P2: 10 + 15 - 15 = 10 → same as before?

Wait! That’s a critical point.

Let’s re-analyze.

- When P1 plays A0: P1 gets +15, P2 loses 15 → so P2's payoff is reduced by 15.
- When P2 plays A0: P2 gets +15, P1 loses 15.

So if **both play A0**:
- P1: base 10, gets +15 from contract, but loses 15 (because P2 played A0) → 10 + 15 - 15 = 10
- P2: base 10, gets +15, but loses 15 → 10

So net payoff: (10, 10) — unchanged.

If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1:
- P1: base 0, gets +15 → 15
- P2: base 20, **loses 15** (because P1 played A0) → 5

If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0:
- P1: base 6, but loses 15 (because P2 played A0) → 6 - 15 = -9
- P2: base 2, gets +15 → 17

If both play A1: no contract effect → (4, 4)

So the **new payoff matrix** when the contract is active:

|               | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (10, 10)       | (15, 5)        |
| **P1: A1**    | (-9, 17)       | (4, 4)         |

Wait — P1 gets **-9** when playing A1 and P2 plays A0?

Yes: base payoff is 6, but because P2 played A0, P1 loses 15 → 6 - 15 = -9.

P2 gets 2 + 15 = 17? No — wait, P2 gets +15 from playing A0, but also loses 15 to P1 — but since P1 played A1, P1 does **not** trigger the contract → so P2’s +15 comes from **no one**?

Wait, this is a critical ambiguity.

Let’s re-read the contract:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- When a player chooses A0, they get +15.
- That +15 is **drawn from the other players** — i.e., the other player is forced to pay 15.

But **only if the other player is also playing?** Or in general?

"Drawn equally from the other players" → so if there are two players, the 15 is taken 100% from the other player.

So:
- If P1 plays A0: P1 gets +15; P2 gets -15 (regardless of what P2 plays).
- If P2 plays A0: P2 gets +15; P1 gets -15 (regardless of what P1 plays).

Yes — that’s how it’s worded.

So the contract changes payoffs **in a way that depends on the other player’s action**, but the **penalty** is imposed on the **other player** only if **you** play A0.

But the **benefit** is only if **you** play A0.

So **both** effects happen depending on **your** action.

Let’s recompute the full matrix with the contract:

| P1 \ P2 | A0                 | A1                 |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **A0** | P1: 10 +15 = 25, P2: 10 -15 = -5 | P1: 0 +15 = 15, P2: 20 -15 = 5 |
| **A1** | P1: 6 -15 = -9, P2: 2 +15 = 17 | P1: 4, P2: 4 |

Wait — when P1 plays A1, P1 doesn’t get +15, but **if P2 plays A0**, P2 gets +15, so P1 must pay 15 → yes.

So:
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 6 (base) -15 = -9; P2 gets 2 (base) +15 = 17
- (A1, A1): neither gets bonus, so (4,4)

And (A0, A0): both get +15 (from contract), and both lose 15 (to the other) → net: 10, 10

Wait — let’s compute that:

- P1: A0 → +15, but P2 played A0 → so P1 loses 15 → net: 10 + 15 - 15 = 10
- P2: A0 → +15, P1 played A0 → P2 loses 15 → 10 + 15 - 15 = 10

Yes → (10,10)

Similarly:
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → +15 from contract; P2 plays A1 → so P1 does **not** lose anything to P2? Wait — P2 is not playing A0, so P2 does **not** trigger a payment.

But the contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive +15, drawn from the other players."

So only if the **other player** plays A0 does that player **lose** 15.

So:
- When P1 plays A0, P1 gets +15 **regardless** of what P2 does.
- But P2 **only loses 15** if P2 plays A0.

So when P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1:
- P1: base 0 +15 = 15
- P2: base 20, but **P1 played A0**, so P2 pays 15? Wait — **no**.

The **recipient** of the +15 is the player who played A0.

The **payer** is the other player **only if that player is also playing A0**?

No — the contract says: the bonus is **drawn equally from the other players** — meaning that the **other player(s)** pay the 15.

So if **only you** play A0, then the 15 must be drawn from the other player(s), even if they didn’t play A0.

That is, **any time you play A0**, you get +15 from the other player, regardless of what they play.

Similarly, when they play A0, they get +15 from you.

So yes, the **penalty** (being forced to pay) applies **whenever you play A0**, and is paid to the player who played A0.

So:
- (A0, A0): P1 gets +15, pays 15 (to P2) → net 10 + 15 - 15 = 10
  P2 gets +15, pays 15 → 10
- (A0, A1): P1 gets +15, pays 15 → net 0 + 15 - 15 = 0? Wait — P2 played A1, so P2 did **not** get a bonus, so who is P1 paying?

Ah! Here's the **crucial point**: the contract says the **bonus is drawn from the other players** — so if **only one player plays A0**, the other player **must pay 15**.

But the other player did **not** get a bonus, so they are paying 15 **without** receiving anything.

Is that intended?

Yes — it says: “drawn equally from the other players” — so it’s a **transfer from the other player(s)** to the player who played A0, **regardless** of whether the other played A0 or not.

So even if P2 plays A1, **P2 must pay 15 to P1** if P1 plays A0.

Similarly, if P2 plays A0, P1 must pay 15 to P2.

So the effect is:
- Whenever P1 plays A0: P1 receives +15, P2 pays 15 → P2’s total payoff is reduced by 15.
- Whenever P2 plays A0: P2 receives +15, P1 pays 15 → P1’s total payoff is reduced by 15.

Therefore, the full payoff matrix with contract:

|           | P2: A0               | P2: A1              |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **P1: A0** | (10 +15 -15, 10 -15 +15) = (10, 10) | (0 +15 -15, 20 -15) = (0, 5) |
| **P1: A1** | (6 -15, 2 +15 -15) = (-9, 2) | (4, 4)              |

Wait, let's compute carefully:

### (A0, A0):
- P1: base 10, +15 (from contract), but P2 played A0 → P1 must pay P2 15 → net: 10 +15 -15 = 10
- P2: base 10, +15 (from contract), but P1 played A0 → P2 must pay P1 15 → net: 10 +15 -15 = 10 → (10,10)

### (A0, A1):
- P1: base 0, plays A0 → +15, P2 played A1 → P2 **must still pay** P1 15 (because P1 played A0) → so P1 gets 0 +15 +15? No — wait.

No: the +15 is **the payment received**, and **paying** 15 is **separate**.

But: when P1 plays A0 → P1 **receives +15**, and **P2 is forced to pay 15**.

So P1 gets +15 from the contract.
P2 loses 15.

But the contract says: “drawn equally from the other players” — so yes, P2 pays 15 to P1.

So:
- P1: 0 (base) + 15 (contract) = 15
- P2: 20 (base) - 15 (payment) = 5

Wait — this contradicts the previous reasoning.

So **the key** is: the **+15 is a transfer from the other player(s)**.

So:
- When you play A0, you receive +15, and **the other player pays you 15**.
- When the other player plays A0, you pay them 15.

So the **net effect**:
- If **only P1 plays A0**, P1 gets +15 from P2, and P2 loses 15.
- If **only P2 plays A0**, P1 loses 15 to P2.
- If both play A0: P1 gets +15 from P2, but must pay 15 to P2 → net 0 for the transfer.
  P2 gets +15 from P1, but must pay 15 to P1 → net 0 → so only base payoffs matter → (10,10)
  But wait: P1 gets +15 (from contract), but pays 15 (to P2) → net contract gain = 0
  So final: (10,10)

Similarly, if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1:
- P1 gets +15 from P2 (via contract)
- P2 pays 15 to P1
- So P1’s total: 0 (base) +15 = 15
- P2’s total: 20 -15 = 5

If P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0:
- P1 must pay 15 to P2 (because P2 played A0)
- P1’s total: 6 -15 = -9
- P2: 2 +15 = 17

If both play A1:
- No one gets contract bonus → (4,4)

### Final contract payoff matrix:

|           | P2: A0            | P2: A1            |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10)          | (15, 5)           |
| **P1: A1** | (-9, 17)          | (4, 4)            |

Yes, this is correct.

---

### Step 5: Analyze the game with the contract in effect

Now, what is the best strategy for Player 1?

Let’s find the best response.

#### Suppose Player 2 plays A0:
- P1: A0 → 10
- P1: A1 → -9 → better to play A0

#### Suppose Player 2 plays A1:
- P1: A0 → 15
- P1: A1 → 4 → better to play A0

So **in both cases, Player 1 prefers A0**!

So A0 is a **dominant strategy** for Player 1 under the contract.

Similarly, what about Player 2?

#### If P1 plays A0:
- P2: A0 → 10
- P2: A1 → 5 → better to play A0

#### If P1 plays A1:
- P2: A0 → 17
- P2: A1 → 4 → better to play A0

So **Player 2 also has A0 as dominant strategy**.

So **equilibrium: (A0, A0)** with payoff (10,10)

Thus, with the contract in effect, expected payoff for Player 1 is **10**.

---

### Step 6: Compare with not signing the contract

Without the contract, as we determined earlier, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), payoff (4,4).

But is that the only possibility?

Actually, without contract, the game is:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 10,10 | 6,2 |
| A1     | 0,20 | 4,4 |

Player 1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0 → A0 (10) > A1 (6)
- If P2 plays A1 → A0 (0) < A1 (4) → so A1

Player 2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → A1 (20) > A0 (10)
- If P1 plays A1 → A1 (4) > A0 (2)

So only pure strategy equilibrium is (A1, A1) → payoff (4,4)

But if both play A0, both get 10 → better than (4,4), but not sustainable because if P1 plays A0, P2 wants to play A1 to get 20.

But with contract, **both players are incentivized to play A0**.

So under contract, payoff goes from 4 to 10 for Player 1.

But here’s the catch: **you only benefit from the contract if the other player signs it**.

If you sign, but the other player doesn’t sign, then the contract doesn’t activate.

Then the game is the base game, and you could get 4 in equilibrium.

But if you sign **and** the other player signs, you get 10.

So should you sign?

This depends on whether you believe the other player will also sign.

But we’re told: “the contract was selected via approval voting” — and since it’s two players, approval voting passed → both must agree.

But you are being asked: "should you sign?"

So if you **don’t sign**, the contract fails → game reverts to base game → expected payoff ~4

If you **sign**, and the other player signs (which they did, since approval voting passed), then payoff is 10.

So if you sign, you get 10.

If you don’t sign, and the contract doesn’t activate, you get only ~4.

But the approval voting result suggests the other player agreed.

So **you should sign**, because you get 10 instead of 4.

Moreover, signing **does not hurt you** — if you sign, and the other signs, you get 10.

If you don’t sign, the contract fails → you get 4.

And there’s no downside to signing — you don’t lose money.

So **signing is strictly better**.

But wait — what if the other player **only signed** because they believe you’ll sign? But since approval voting passed, both signed.

The key is: **if you don’t sign, contract doesn't activate** → you get base game payoff.

But if you do sign, and the other signed → contract active → you get 10.

So the only reason not to sign is if you expect the other player not to sign — but the information says it was **selected via approval voting**, which means **it passed**, so **both signed**? Not necessarily.

Approval voting: each player votes yes/no.

The contract is selected if all approve.

So the fact that it was “selected” means **both players approved** — otherwise it wouldn't be selected.

Therefore, **the other player has already signed**.

So if you sign, contract is active → you get 10.

If you don't sign, contract is not active → you get 4.

So **you should sign**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's carefully break this down step by step to determine the optimal strategy for Player 1 (you), accounting for both the base payoff structure and the **payment contract**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Payoff Matrix**

We are given the following base payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

| You (P1) \ Other (P2) | A0       | A1       |
|------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                 | (10, 10) | (0, 20)  |
| **A1**                 | (6, 2)   | (4, 4)   |

This is a classic coordination game with some incentive to defect.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Payment Contract**

The contract is **in effect**, and it modifies the total payoff depending on your choice:

- **If you choose A0**, you receive **+15 points**, paid **from the other player’s pocket**.
  - So, you gain 15 extra points.
  - The other player **loses 15 points** (as they pay you).
- **If you choose A1**, there is **no additional payment** — nothing added or subtracted.

This means: **Your actual total payoff = base payoff + (15 if you chose A0 else 0)**

However, **the cost is taken from the other player**, meaning:
- When you choose A0, you get +15, and the other player gets **-15** in the base payoff.
- When you choose A1, no extra payment, so both keep their base payoff.

---

### **Step 3: Adjust the Payoff Matrix to Include Contract**

Let’s recompute the **effective payoffs** for Player 1 and Player 2.

We’ll update the matrix accordingly.

#### **Case 1: You A0, Other A0**
- Base: (10, 10)
- You chose A0 → +15 to you
- Other chose A0 → -15 to other (from contract)
- So: (10 + 15, 10 - 15) = **(25, -5)**

#### **Case 2: You A0, Other A1**
- Base: (0, 20)
- You chose A0 → +15 → total: 0 + 15 = 15
- Other chose A1 → no payment → they keep 20
- So: **(15, 20)**

Wait — **this seems inconsistent**. Does the contract mean the other player **only pays** when *they* choose A0?

Let’s re-read the contract carefully:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.

Ah — key part: **"drawn equally from the other players"** — meaning **if you choose A0**, you receive 15 points, and the **payment comes from the other player(s)**.

So **only the player who chooses A0 gets +15**, and **the other player (or players) loses 15** for each such player? But since there's only one other player, the 15 must come from them.

So yes: **whenever you choose A0**, you get +15, and the **other player loses 15** (regardless of what they choose).

Similarly, **if the other player chooses A0**, they get +15, and **you lose 15**.

So **both players’ payoffs are affected by their own choice** via the contract.

We must adjust **both** players' payoffs based on **their own action selection**.

So the contract is **per player**: if you pick A0 → +15, and the other player loses 15.

So in **Case 1: You A0, Other A0**
- You: base 10 + 15 (from your A0) = 25
- Other: base 10 - 15 (because you chose A0) = -5
→ (25, -5)

In **Case 2: You A0, Other A1**
- You: base 0 + 15 = 15
- Other: base 20 - 15 = 5 (since you chose A0, they lose 15)
→ (15, 5)

In **Case 3: You A1, Other A0**
- You: base 6 + 0 (you chose A1, no extra) = 6
- Other: base 2 + 15 (they chose A0) = 17
→ (6, 17)

Wait! **But** — from the contract: *if a player chooses A0, they get +15, paid from others.*

So **Other** chose A0 → they get +15 → but who pays? You do — because they are drawing from the other player.

So yes, **if Other chooses A0**, you (Player 1) lose 15.

So in **Case 3: You A1, Other A0**
- You: base 6 - 15 = -9
- Other: base 2 + 15 = 17
→ (-9, 17)

In **Case 4: You A1, Other A1**
- You: base 4 + 0 = 4
- Other: base 4 + 0 = 4
→ (4, 4)

---

### ✅ Updated Effective Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

| You \ Other | A0        | A1        |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**      | (25, -5)  | (15, 5)   |
| **A1**      | (-9, 17)  | (4, 4)    |

Let’s verify:
- You choose A0 → you get +15, other loses 15.
- Other chooses A0 → other gets +15, you lose 15.

Yes — correct.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Best Responses**

We need to find the **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies, because both players are choosing probabilities.

Let:
- You (Player 1) play A0 with probability **p**
- Other (Player 2) play A0 with probability **q**

We want to find **your optimal p** that maximizes your expected payoff, **assuming the other player chooses q optimally in response**, or in equilibrium.

But since **you are trying to maximize your own payoff**, and you know the contract, you need to pick a **p** that is optimal **against any reasonable best response** by the other player — but ideally, you want to **make yourself indifferent** or find the best **response**.

Let’s compute **your expected payoff as a function of p and q**.

---

### **Step 5: Expected Payoff for You (Player 1)**

You choose A0 with prob p, A1 with prob (1-p)  
Other chooses A0 with prob q, A1 with prob (1-q)

Your expected payoff:

E[P1] =  
p * q * 25 +  
p * (1-q) * 15 +  
(1-p) * q * (-9) +  
(1-p) * (1-q) * 4

Let’s expand:

E[P1] =  
25pq + 15p(1-q) + (-9)(1-p)q + 4(1-p)(1-q)

Expand each term:

= 25pq + 15p - 15pq -9q + 9pq + 4(1 - p - q + pq)

Now expand the last term:

= 25pq + 15p - 15pq -9q + 9pq + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq

Now combine like terms:

- pq terms: 25pq -15pq +9pq +4pq = (25 -15 +9 +4) pq = 23pq  
- p terms: 15p - 4p = 11p  
- q terms: -9q -4q = -13q  
- constant: +4

So:

> E[P1] = **23pq + 11p - 13q + 4**

---

### **Step 6: Best Response of Player 2**

Player 2 (Other) is trying to **maximize their own payoff**, so we need to consider their payoff function.

From the matrix:

Player 2's expected payoff:

E[P2] =  
q * p * (-5) +  
q * (1-p) * 5 +  
(1-q) * p * 17 +  
(1-q) * (1-p) * 4

Let’s compute:

= -5pq + 5q(1-p) + 17(1-q)p + 4(1-q)(1-p)

Expand:

= -5pq + 5q - 5pq + 17p - 17pq + 4(1 - p - q + pq)

= -5pq + 5q - 5pq + 17p - 17pq + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq

Combine:

- pq: -5 -5 -17 +4 = (-23) pq  
- p: 17p - 4p = 13p  
- q: 5q - 4q = 1q  
- constant: 4

So:

> E[P2] = **-23pq + 13p + q + 4**

Player 2 chooses q to **maximize E[P2]**.

So for fixed p, they choose q ∈ [0,1] to maximize:

E[P2] = -23pq + 13p + q + 4

Treat as function of q:

E[P2] = q(-23p + 1) + (13p + 4)

This is linear in q.

- If coefficient of q is > 0 → choose q = 1
- If coefficient < 0 → choose q = 0
- If = 0 → indifferent

So:

Set: -23p + 1 > 0 → p < 1/23 ≈ 0.0435

So:
- If p < 1/23 ≈ 0.0435 → best response q = 1
- If p > 1/23 → best response q = 0
- If p = 1/23 → any q is best response

---

### **Step 7: Your Best Response**

Now, **you** choose p to maximize your expected payoff, anticipating that the other player will best respond to your p.

So we analyze your expected payoff **E[P1] = 23pq + 11p - 13q + 4**, but q depends on p.

Let’s consider two cases.

---

#### **Case 1: p < 1/23 ≈ 0.0435**

Then q = 1

So plug q = 1 into E[P1]:

E[P1] = 23p(1) + 11p -13(1) + 4 = 23p + 11p -13 + 4 = 34p - 9

Since p < 1/23, maximum in this region is near p = 1/23

So E[P1] ≈ 34*(1/23) - 9 ≈ 1.478 - 9 = **-7.522**

---

#### **Case 2: p > 1/23**

Then q = 0

Plug q = 0 into E[P1]:

E[P1] = 0 + 11p - 0 + 4 = 11p + 4

This is increasing in p → so best to choose p as **high as possible**, i.e., p = 1

Then E[P1] = 11(1) + 4 = **15**

---

#### **Case 3: p = 1/23**

Then q is indeterminate → you can choose any q.

E[P1] = 23*(1/23)*q + 11*(1/23) -13q + 4  
= q + 11/23 -13q + 4  
= -12q + (11/23 + 4)  
= -12q + (11/23 + 92/23) = -12q + 103/23 ≈ -12q + 4.478

This is decreasing in q → so maximum when q = 0 → E[P1] ≈ 4.478

Which is **less than 15**.

So not better.

Thus, the optimal strategy for you is:

- Choose p = 1 (i.e., always play A0)
- Because when p > 1/23, the other player best responds with q = 0
- Then your payoff is 11p + 4, maximized at p = 1 → 15

Wait — but is this actually optimal?

Wait — let’s double-check: **when p = 1**, then q = 0 (best response of other player) → so other plays A1 for sure.

Then your payoff is: You A0, Other A1 → (15, 5) → you get 15

Is this the maximum?

But what if you play **p = 1**, but other plays q = 0 → payoff 15

Can you do better?

Wait — let’s consider: what if you play A0, and other plays A1 → you get 15

What if you play A0, other plays A0 → you get 25 → **higher**

But if you play A0, and other plays A0, you get 25, but **they lose 15** → so they may not want to play A0.

Indeed, from earlier: **when you play p > 1/23**, other plays **q = 0** → so they avoid playing A0 because that gives them a high cost (because you are playing A0, so they lose 15).

So they **never** play A0 in equilibrium.

Thus, your best payoff is **15**, when you play A0 with certainty, and they play A1.

Can you do better?

Wait — what if you play A1?

In that case, your payoff is:

- If other plays A0 (q=1): you get -9 (bad)
- If other plays A1 (q=0): you get 4

So worst-case: -9, best: 4

But if you play A1, and others play A1 → you get 4

Or if you play A0, you get 15

So 15 > 4, so better to play A0.

But is there a mixed strategy that does better?

We just showed that for any p < 1/23, best response of other is q = 1 → then your payoff is 34p - 9 → max about -7.52, worse than 15.

For p > 1/23, q = 0 → your payoff is 11p + 4 → increasing in p → so best at p = 1 → payoff = 15

So **optimal strategy: play A0 with probability 100**

Wait — but is there a **mistake in the logic**?

Let’s consider: if you play A0 with certainty, does the other player want to play A1?

Yes — their best response.

Let’s verify:

If you play A0 for sure (p = 1), then:

They have two choices:

- Play A0: payoff = -5 (from matrix in A0-A0 entry) → but wait: when they play A0, they get +15 from contract (because they chose A0), but you are playing A0 → so **you lose 15**

Wait — in the matrix:

- If You A0, Other A0: (25, -5)
  - You: 25
  - Other: -5

But why is their payoff -5?

Because: base payoff is 10 (A0 vs A0), but they **chose A0** → so get +15, but **you (the other player) are playing A0** → so **you lose 15**? No — in this case, **you are the other player**.

Clarify:

- When **other player** chooses A0 → they get +15 from contract, and **you (Player 1) lose 15**

In case (You A0, Other A0):
- You: base 10 + 15 (you chose A0) = 25
- Other: base 10 + 15 (they chose A0) = 25? But then we said -5! Inconsistency!

Wait — **this is a critical mistake.**

---

### 🔥 Critical Correction

Let’s go back to the contract:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.

Key: **"drawn from the other players"**

So **when you choose A0**, the 15 points are **taken from the other player(s)**.

But **if the other player chooses A0**, then **they get +15**, drawn from you.

So in the **same move**, **both** players could be getting money if both choose A0.

But who pays whom?

The contract says the payment is "drawn equally from the other players" — so if **you** choose A0, your +15 is taken from **other player(s)** → one other player → so **other loses 15**, regardless of what they do.

Similarly, if **other chooses A0**, **you lose 15**.

So in the case where **both choose A0**:

- You: base 10 + 15 (for your A0) = 25
- Other: base 10 + 15 (their A0) = 25
- But wait — both are “drawn from the other” — so:
  - You get +15, paid by other → so other loses 15
  - Other gets +15, paid by you → you lose 15

So net effect: **you lose 15, other loses 15**, but both gain 15 from their choice?

No — that can’t happen.

Actually, **when you choose A0**, **you get +15**, and **the other player loses 15**, regardless of what the other player does.

Similarly, **when the other player chooses A0**, **they get +15**, and **you lose 15**.

So **in a joint A0 move**, both actions happen:

- You choose A0 → you gain 15, other loses 15
- Other chooses A0 → other gains 15, you lose 15

So **net**:

- You: base 10 + 15 (from your A0) - 15 (because they chose A0) = **10**
- Other: base 10 + 15 (their A0) - 15 (because you chose A0) = **10**

So **no net gain from contract** — they cancel out.

Wait — that changes everything.

But earlier I thought the contract is "drawn from other players" — so if multiple players choose A0, who pays?

The wording: "drawn equally from the other players"

So if two players both choose A0, then **each** draws 15 from the other — so it balances.

But it’s a **net transfer**.

So **if two players both choose A0**, then:
- Player 1: +15 (from contract) -15 (because other chose A0) = 0 net from contract
- Player 2: +15 -15 = 0 net

So **no net gain** from contract in that case.

But if **only one** chooses A0, then:
- That player gets +15
- The other loses 15

So let’s **recompute the effective payoffs**.

---

### ✅ Corrected Payoff Matrix

#### Case 1: You A0, Other A0
- You: base 10 + 15 (you chose A0) - 15 (other chose A0) = 10
- Other: base 10 + 15 (other chose A0) - 15 (you chose A0) = 10
→ (10, 10)

#### Case 2: You A0, Other A1
- You: base 0 + 15 (you chose A0) - 0 (other didn’t choose A0) = 15
- Other: base 20 + 0 (didn’t choose A0) - 0 = 20
→ (15, 20)

Wait — no: other did *not* choose A0 → so no cost to them from contract.

You chose A0 → so you get +15, and other loses 15 → but **only if you are the one choosing A0**

So:
- You: 0 + 15 = 15 (you chose A0)
- Other: 20 - 15 = 5 (because you chose A0, they lose 15)

Yes.

So (15, 5)

#### Case 3: You A1, Other A0
- You: base 6 + 0 (you didn’t choose A0) -15 (other chose A0) = -9
- Other: base 2 + 15 (they chose A0) - 0 = 17
→ (-9, 17)

#### Case 4: You A1, Other A1
- You: base 4 + 0 - 0 = 4
- Other: base 4 + 0 - 0 = 4
→ (4, 4)

So the corrected matrix is:

| You \ Other | A0       | A1       |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**      | (10, 10) | (15, 5)  |
| **A1**      | (-9, 17) | (4, 4)   |

This is **different from earlier**.

So the contract only applies:
- +15 if you choose A0 → from other player
- +15 if other chooses A0 → from you

So when both choose A0, **net effect: no contract gain** → only base payoff.

But when only one chooses A0, that player gains 15, and the other loses 15.

This makes sense.

So final matrix:

| You \ Other | A0       | A1       |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**      | (10, 10) | (15, 5)  |
| **A1**      | (-9, 17) | (4, 4)   |

Now recalculate.

---

### **Step 8: Analyze Corrected Matrix**

Let’s find Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- You play A0 with prob p
- Other plays A0 with prob q

#### Your expected payoff:

E[P1] =  
p q * 10 +  
p (1-q) * 15 +  
(1-p) q * (-9) +  
(1-p)(1-q) * 4

Expand:

= 10pq + 15p - 15pq -9q + 9pq + 4(1 - p - q + pq)

= 10pq + 15p -15pq -9q +9pq + 4 -4p -4q +4pq

Combine:
- pq: 10 -15 +9 +4 = 8pq
- p: 15p -4p = 11p
- q: -9q -4q = -13q
- const: 4

→ **E[P1] = 8pq + 11p -13q + 4**

---

### **Step 9: Best Response of Other Player**

Other's payoff:

- A0: 10 (if you A0), 17 (if you A1)
- So: q * 10p + (1-q)*17*(1-p) + other terms?

Wait:

E[P2] = q * [p*10 + (1-p)*17] + (1-q)*[p*5 + (1-p)*4]

= q [10p + 17 -17p] + (1-q)[5p + 4 -4p]

= q [17 -7p] + (1-q)[p + 4]

Expand:

= 17q -7pq + p + 4 - q p - 4q

= 17q -7pq + p + 4 - pq -4q

= (17q -4q) + (-7pq -pq) + p + 4

= 13q -8pq + p + 4

So E[P2] = -8pq + p + 13q + 4

Take derivative w.r.t q:

d/dq = -8p + 13

So:
- If -8p + 13 > 0 → p < 13/8 = 1.625 → always true since p ≤ 1
So -8p + 13 > 0 for all p in [0,1]

Because 13/8 = 1.625, so for p < 1.625, which is all p, the derivative is positive → so best response is **q = 1**

For all p, the best response of Player 2 is **q = 1**

Because they always prefer A0.

Let’s check: their payoff from A0 vs A1:

- If you play A0 (p=1): A0 gives 10, A1 gives 5 → prefer A0
- If you play A1 (p=0): A0 gives 17, A1 gives 4 → prefer A0

So regardless of p, **Player 2 always prefers A0**

Therefore, **Best response of Other: q = 1**

---

### **Step 10: Your Best Response to q = 1**

Now, you know Other plays A0 with probability 1.

So you choose p to maximize your payoff.

Your expected payoff when q = 1:

E[P1] = 8p(1) + 11p -13(1) + 4 = 8p + 11p -13 + 4 = 19p -9

This is increasing in p → so best to maximize p = 1

Then E[P1] = 19 - 9 = **10**

If you play p = 0 → E[P1] = -9

So maximum payoff: **10** when you play A0 with probability 1.

---

### **Conclusion**

- Other player always plays A0 (best response)
- You, to maximize your payoff, play A0 with probability 1
- You get 10 points

No better way.

Even if you mixed, your expected payoff would be lower.

So your optimal strategy is to always play A0.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the core game (without contract)**

We are in a two-player simultaneous move game. The payoff matrix (from **Player 2's perspective**) is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**               | 10       | 2        |
| **A1**               | 20       | 4        |

Wait — remember: **You are Player 2**, so the rows are your choices, and the columns are the other player’s choices.

But note: **The payoff numbers are for the player in that cell**, so:

- (A0, A0): You get 10, opponent gets 10
- (A1, A0): You get 20, opponent gets 0
- (A0, A1): You get 2, opponent gets 6
- (A1, A1): You get 4, opponent gets 4

So the actual **payoff matrix for Player 2** is:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 10 | 2  |
| A1     | 20 | 4  |

---

### **Step 2: Add the contract (which affects payoffs)**

The **contract** says:

> - If a player chooses **A0**, they receive an **additional 15 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses **A1**, no additional payments.

So, the contract is a **transfer** from the **other player** to the one who chooses A0, **regardless** of the other player’s choice.

Let’s break this down.

Suppose you (Player 2) choose A0. Then you get **+15 points**, and the **other player (Player 1)** loses **15 points** (since the 15 comes from them).

Similarly, if Player 1 chooses A0, they get +15 and you lose 15.

The contract is **independent** of the outcome — it's **per choice**.

So we must **adjust all payoffs** for Player 2 based on both players’ choices, because the contract only depends on the actions chosen.

Let’s modify the payoff table to include the **contract-based transfers**.

---

### **Step 3: Revised payoff matrix with contract**

We compute **Player 2’s total expected payoff** (original payoff + contract adjustment).

Let’s build a full table:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1 gets +15, P2 loses 15) | A1 (no effect) |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **A0** (P2 gets +15, P1 loses 15) | Original: 10 → 10 + 15 -15 = **10** | Original: 2 → 2 + 15 = **17** |
| **A1** (P2 gets 0 extra) | Original: 20 → 20 -15 = **5** | Original: 4 → 4 = **4** |

Wait — this needs careful analysis:

Let’s clarify the **contract mechanism**:

- **If you choose A0**, you get **+15**, **and** the other player **loses 15**.
- If you choose A1, **no change**.

So the **transfer is applied based on your own action**, and it’s **from the other player to you**, **regardless** of what the other player did.

So now we build the **total payoff for Player 2**:

#### Case 1: P2 = A0, P1 = A0
- Original: P2 gets 10
- P2 chose A0 → gets +15
- P1 chose A0 → P1 loses 15 (so P2 gains that 15)
- But **wait**: does the 15 come from “the other players” (i.e., P1), and does this apply **independent** of the original payoff?

Yes — the contract says: 
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So “drawn equally” — but only two players, so it’s **15 from the other player**.

So:

- When P2 chooses A0 → P2 gains 15 (from P1).
- When P1 chooses A0 → P1 loses 15 (to P2).

So the **contract effect** is **not** multiplicative or additive across both — it's **per player**.

Therefore, **P2’s total payoff** = original payoff + (15 if P2 chose A0) - (15 if P1 chose A0) ????

Wait — no.

Let’s re-read: "**If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 points, drawn equally from the other players.**"

"Drawn equally from the other players" — but there's only one other player. So it's **drawn from the other player** — i.e., the other player loses 15.

So:
- If P2 chooses A0 → P2 +15, P1 -15
- If P1 chooses A0 → P1 +15, P2 -15

So the net **effect on P2** is:
- +15 if P2 chose A0
- -15 if P1 chose A0

Yes — simple.

So **P2’s total payoff** = base payoff + (15 if P2 chose A0) - (15 if P1 chose A0)

Similarly, P1's payoff = base + (15 if P1 chose A0) - (15 if P2 chose A0)

So for P2, we can now recompute the total payoff:

#### Full payoff table for Player 2:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1 chose A0 → P2 loses 15) | A1 (P1 chose A1 → P2 not affected) |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| **A0** (P2 chose A0 → P2 +15) | Base: 10 → 10 + 15 -15 = **10** | Base: 2 → 2 +15 = **17** |
| **A1** (P2 chose A1 → no +15) | Base: 20 → 20 -15 = **5** | Base: 4 → 4 = **4** |

So the **correct revised payoff matrix for Player 2** is:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 10 | 17 |
| A1     | 5  | 4  |

---

### **Step 4: Best response analysis for Player 2**

We now want to find a **strategy for Player 2** (a probability of choosing A0, say p, and A1 = 1-p) that maximizes expected points **given that Player 1 is rational and also playing optimally**.

This is a simultaneous-move game with asymmetric payoffs, but we must assume Player 1 is also trying to maximize their own payoff. So we look for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

But first: **Who is Player 1?** We are Player 2.

So we need to **anticipate Player 1’s strategy**.

Let’s build the **payoff matrix for Player 1** as well, to analyze best responses.

---

### **Step 5: Payoff matrix for Player 1 (with contract)**

Player 1’s total payoff = base payoff + (15 if P1 chose A0) - (15 if P2 chose A0)

Recall base payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2 chose A0 → P1 loses 15) | A1 (P2 chose A1 → P1 unaffected) |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| **A0** (P1 chose A0 → +15) | Base: 10 → 10 +15 -15 = **10** | Base: 0 → 0 +15 = **15** |
| **A1** (P1 chose A1 → 0 extra) | Base: 6 → 6 -15 = **-9** | Base: 4 → 4 = **4** |

So for Player 1:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 10 | 15 |
| A1     | -9 | 4  |

---

### **Step 6: Find mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**

Let:
- p = probability that **Player 2 (you)** chooses A0.
- q = probability that **Player 1** chooses A0.

We want to find the equilibrium (p, q) such that neither player can gain by deviating.

#### Step 6.1: Player 2’s best response to Player 1's strategy

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If P2 plays A0:  
  = q * 10 + (1−q) * 17 = 10q + 17(1−q) = 17 - 7q
- If P2 plays A1:  
  = q * 5 + (1−q) * 4 = 5q + 4(1−q) = 4 + q

P2 will play A0 only if:  
17 - 7q ≥ 4 + q  
→ 17 - 4 ≥ 7q + q  
→ 13 ≥ 8q  
→ q ≤ 13/8 = 1.625 → always true since q ≤ 1

So **17 - 7q ≥ 4 + q** for all q ∈ [0,1]

Because max difference: q=0 → 17 vs 4 → A0 better  
q=1 → 17−7=10 vs 4+1=5 → still better.

So **Player 2's best response is always to play A0**, **regardless** of Player 1's strategy.

**Wait. That seems surprising.** Let’s double-check:

At q=0 (Player 1 always plays A1):  
- A0: 17  
- A1: 4 → A0 better

At q=1:  
- A0: 10  
- A1: 5 → A0 still better

So yes: **A0 dominates A1 for Player 2 in terms of expected payoff**, for **any** q.

So **Player 2 should always choose A0** — pure strategy.

But wait — is it really? Let’s check if Player 1 might **choose** a strategy where A1 is as good as A0 for Player 2?

But we just saw that A0 is always better.

So **Player 2 has a dominant strategy: A0**.

But let’s now check **Player 1’s strategy** — maybe Player 1 adjusts in response.

#### Step 6.2: Player 1’s best response to Player 2’s strategy

Player 1’s payoff:

- If P1 plays A0: q → actually, we need to reverse the roles.

Let p = P(P2 plays A0)

Then:
- If P1 plays A0:  
  = p * 10 + (1−p) * 15 = 10p + 15(1−p) = 15 - 5p
- If P1 plays A1:  
  = p * (-9) + (1−p) * 4 = -9p + 4(1−p) = 4 - 13p

Now find when A0 is better than A1:
15 - 5p ≥ 4 - 13p  
→ 15 - 4 ≥ -13p + 5p  
→ 11 ≥ -8p  
→ Always true since p ≥ 0

So 15 - 5p ≥ 4 - 13p for all p in [0,1]

At p=0: A0: 15, A1: 4 → A0 better  
At p=1: A0: 10, A1: 4 -13 = -9 → A0 still better

So **Player 1 also always prefers A0**, regardless of p.

This suggests: **A0 is a dominant strategy for both players**.

But wait — let’s check the payoffs again.

Wait a second.

Player 1’s payoff when playing A0:
- Against P2 A0: 10
- Against P2 A1: 15 → so yes, A0 is better regardless.

But let’s check if this makes sense.

In the base game, Player 1 prefers A0 when P2 plays A1 (gets 15 vs 4), and gets 10 vs 6 when P2 plays A0 → still better than A1.

So A0 seems strong.

But wait: in the **contract**, if Player 1 chooses A0, they get +15, but **lose 15 if P2 chooses A0**.

But in **both cases**, the net gain is positive?

For P1:
- If P2 chooses A0 → P1 gets +15 (from choosing A0) but loses 15 (because P2 chose A0) → net: 0 extra base
- But base payoff is 10 → so total 10
- If P2 chooses A1 → P1 gets +15 (from A0) and no loss (because P2 didn’t choose A0) → base 0 → total 15

So yes, A0 gives P1 either 10 or 15, A1 gives -9 or 4 → so A0 always better.

Similarly for P2:
- If P1 chooses A0: P2 gets +15 (from A0), but -15 (because P1 chose A0) → net: base 10 → total 10
- If P1 chooses A1: P2 gets +15 (A0), no loss → base 2 → total 17

A1 gives: if P1 A0 → 20 -15 = 5, if P1 A1 → 4

So A0: 10 or 17 → min 10  
A1: 5 or 4 → max 5

So A0 strictly better in all cases.

Therefore, **A0 is the dominant strategy for both players**.

Therefore, the **unique Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**.

So both players will play A0.

But we are asked: **choose a probability distribution over actions each round**.

Since A0 is the **dominant strategy**, and **strictly better in every cell**, the optimal response is to play **A0 with probability 100%**.

But wait — let’s be very careful.

Is there **any scenario** where playing A1 could be better?

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability 0.01, A1 0.99.

Then P2’s expected payoff:
- A0: 0.01 * 10 + 0.99 * 17 = 0.1 + 16.83 = 16.93
- A1: 0.01 * 5 + 0.99 * 4 = 0.05 + 3.96 = 4.01 → still A0 much better.

Even with P1 playing A0 99% of the time:
- P2 A0: 0.99*10 + 0.01*17 = 9.9 + 0.17 = 10.07
- P2 A1: 0.99*5 + 0.01*4 = 4.95 + 0.04 = 4.99 → still better.

So in no case is A1 better than A0.

Therefore, **P2 should always choose A0**.

Hence, the optimal strategy is to play A0 with **100% probability**.

But wait — let's double-check one thing.

Is the contract **applied per player**, or is there a limit?

The contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 15 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

Since there is only **one other player**, the 15 comes from them.

But what if both choose A0? Then:
- P2 gets +15 from choosing A0
- P2 loses 15 from P1 choosing A0 → net: 0
- So total: base 10 → still 10

But if P2 had chosen A1 instead, P2 loses 15 (due to P1’s A0) → base 20 → total 5

So still better to choose A0 even if P1 does.

So no issue.

### **Conclusion**

The contract **strongly incentivizes A0**, and in fact makes **A0 a dominant strategy** for both players.

Therefore, the optimal strategy for Player 2 is to play **A0 with 100% probability**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
