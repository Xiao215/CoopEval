To maximize the total points in this coordination game (a variant of the Stag Hunt), the ideal mediator should achieve two goals:
1.  **Coordinate on the payoff-dominant equilibrium (A0, A0):** When both players delegate, the mediator should play A0 for both, resulting in 5 points each.
2.  **Incentivize delegation and provide security:** When only one player delegates, the mediator should protect that player and provide a reason for the other player to delegate as well.

Let's evaluate the payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

If the mediator plays **A1** when only one player delegates ($n=1$):
- The delegating player is guaranteed 3 points regardless of what the other player does (since (A1, A0) gives the delegator 3 and (A1, A1) gives the delegator 3).
- The non-delegating player would only get 3 points (by playing A1) or 0 points (by playing A0).
- This creates a strong incentive for the second player to delegate as well, because if they also delegate, the mediator will play A0 for both ($n=2$), resulting in 5 points for each instead of 3.

If the mediator plays **A0** when only one player delegates ($n=1$):
- The delegating player is vulnerable. If the other player chooses A1 independently, the delegator gets 0 points.

By setting the mediator to play A1 for $n=1$ and A0 for $n=2$, we create a "safety net" of 3 points for anyone who delegates, while steering the final outcome toward the maximum payoff of 5 points for both when they both choose to cooperate through the mediator.

To maximize points in this Stag Hunt-style game (where A0 is the high-payoff but risky "Stag" and A1 is the lower-payoff but safe "Hare"), the goal of a mediator is to facilitate coordination on the (A0, A0) outcome while minimizing risk for the players.

1.  **Analyze the Payoffs**: 
    - (A0, A0) gives 5 pts (the highest potential outcome).
    - (A1, A1) gives 3 pts. 
    - (A1, A0) gives 3 pts to the player choosing A1.
    - (A0, A1) gives 0 pts to the player choosing A0.
    
2.  **Evaluate the "2 players delegating" scenario**: 
    If both players delegate, the mediator should choose "A0" to ensure both receive the maximum 5 points.

3.  **Evaluate the "1 player delegating" scenario**:
    - If the mediator plays "A0" for one player, that player is at risk of receiving 0 points if the independent player chooses "A1".
    - If the mediator plays "A1" for one player, that player is guaranteed at least 3 points, regardless of what the independent player chooses (since (A1, A0) and (A1, A1) both result in 3 points for Player 1).

4.  **Strategic Design**: 
    A mediator that plays "A1" when only one person delegates is safer and more likely to be approved. It turns the act of delegation into a "safe" move (securing the same 3 points one would get from the safe action A1) while providing the upside of 5 points if both players agree to delegate. This "safety net" encourages both players to delegate, leading to the optimal outcome of 5 points each.

5.  **Final JSON Format**: 
    Based on this reasoning, the mediator should play "A1" if one player delegates and "A0" if two players delegate.

To maximize my expected points, I want the mediator to do two things:

1) **If both players delegate**, the mediator should coordinate us on the payoff-dominant outcome **(A0, A0)**, giving each of us **5**.

2) **If only one player delegates**, that delegating player is exposed to the risk that the non-delegator plays **A1**. In that case, playing **A0** could yield **0**, while playing **A1** guarantees **3** regardless of what the other does. So the mediator should protect a lone delegator by playing **A1**.

This makes delegation attractive (safe when alone, great when both delegate), which should also help the mediator get approvals.

response:
To solve this problem optimally, we need to thoroughly analyze the game and the potential role of the mediator. Here's a structured breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyzing the Payoff Matrix
First, consider the payoff matrix for the game:
- If both players choose A0, each gets 5 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 0 and Player 2 gets 3.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 3 and Player 2 gets 0.
- If both players choose A1, each gets 3 points.

### Step 2: Assessing the Optimal Actions Independently
If players act without coordination and both aim to maximize their own payoffs independently:
- If a player chooses A1, it is a safer strategy than choosing A0. Regardless of what the opponent chooses, Player 1 would get either 3 points (if the opponent chooses A1) or 3 points (if the opponent chooses A0).
- However, mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) gives a higher joint outcome: 5 points each.

### Step 3: Designing a Mediator Strategy
Our goal is to design a mediator that encourages cooperation, ensuring an optimal outcome for both players.
- When one player delegates their move to the mediator, cooperation must still maximize points for that player.
- When both players delegate, the mediator should create mutual cooperation.

Let's consider the scenarios:
1. **One player delegates to the mediator (Key -> Value: "1" -> Action)**
    - The single delegating player should choose an action assuming the other player will not opt for the least cooperative move. Since A1 is the safest individual action, the mediator in this case should play A1.
   
2. **Both players delegate to the mediator (Key -> Value: "2" -> Action)**
    - If both players delegate, the mediator can enforce the best mutual outcome by choosing A0.

### Conclusion
To maximize the total points received by ensuring mutual cooperation, the mediator strategy should be:
- If one player delegates, play A1 (safe strategy for the individual).
- If both players delegate, play A0 (optimal cooperative outcome).

### Step 4: JSON Object Output
The mediator strategy design is expressed in the required JSON format:

```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```

This mediator will encourage optimal play from both players whether they act individually or choose to delegate their actions.

To design an effective mediator for this game, we must consider a few key aspects. These include the payoffs for both players and the dynamics introduced by the mediator. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Payoff Structure:**
   - Both players choosing A0 yields the highest mutual payoff (5 points each).
   - Mixed choices (one A0, the other A1) lead to asymmetric outcomes (one gets 0, the other 3).
   - Both choosing A1 leads to a symmetrical but lower payoff (3 points each).

2. **Analyze Delegation Options:**
   - If both players delegate to the mediator, the mediator's action needs to maximize joint payoffs.
   - If only one player delegates, the mediator's chosen action should ideally still incentivize the other player's action in a way that maximizes the delegating player's points.

3. **Design Choices for Mediator Actions:**
   - **1 Player Delegates:** If only one player delegates, if the mediator chooses the action that aligns with an optimal outcome assuming the other player acts to maximize their own payoff.
     - If the mediator chooses "A0," the best response for an independent player is "A0" to get the highest joint payoff.
     - If the mediator chooses "A1," the independent player might respond with "A0" to maximize their own payoff (but this leads to a mixed and generally suboptimal outcome overall).
   - **2 Players Delegate:** The mediator should choose "A0" to maximize joint payoffs, given that both players have delegated and will follow the mediator's choice.
   
4. **Conclusion for Mediator Design:**
   - For 1 player delegating, "A0" is chosen to incentivize mutual cooperation.
   - For 2 players delegating, "A0" is chosen to maximize mutual payoff (since both players would end up choosing the same action).

### Final JSON Output:

The mediator should play "A0" when either one or two players delegate, as this strategy maximizes mutual payoffs in all scenarios.

```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```

This design ensures that the mediator's choice aligns with the principle of maximizing total points for both delegating players.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Game Structure

This is a symmetric 2-player coordination game with payoff matrix:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 points - **Best mutual outcome**
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3 - **Risky for A0 player**
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0 - **Risky for A0 player**  
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 points - **Safe but suboptimal**

Key insight: There are two Nash equilibria - (A0, A0) giving (5,5) and (A1, A1) giving (3,3). The challenge is coordinating on the better equilibrium.

## Step 2: Design Mediator Strategy

I need to specify what the mediator does for each possible number of delegating players:

**When 2 players delegate:**
- The mediator should play A0 for both players
- This achieves the best outcome (5, 5) and solves the coordination problem

**When 1 player delegates:**
- The mediator should play A1 for the delegating player
- Why? A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of opponent's action (safe floor)
- If mediator played A0, the delegating player risks getting 0

## Step 3: Verify Incentive Structure

With mediator {1: A1, 2: A0}:

- **Both delegate** → (A0, A0) → 5 points each ✓ Best outcome!
- **Only I delegate** → I get A1 → 3 points guaranteed (other player's best response to A1 is A1 → they also get 3)
- **Only other delegates** → They get A1 → 3 points guaranteed (my best response is A1 → I also get 3)
- **Neither delegates** → Back to coordination problem → likely 3 or worse

This creates strong incentives for **mutual delegation** since it's strictly better than all other scenarios!

## Final Answer

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Game Structure

From my perspective (Player 2), the payoffs are:
- Both play A0: I get 5 (best mutual outcome)
- I play A0, other plays A1: I get 0 (worst for me)
- I play A1, other plays A0: I get 3
- Both play A1: I get 3

The game has a dominant outcome at (A0, A0) giving both players 5 points - the highest payoff possible.

## Step 2: Analyze Best Responses

- If opponent plays A0: My best response is A0 (5 > 3)
- If opponent plays A1: My best response is A1 (3 > 0)

This is symmetric for the other player. (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium and Pareto optimal.

## Step 3: Design Mediator Strategy

**When 2 players delegate:**
The mediator plays the same action for both. 
- If it plays A0: both get 5 points ✓
- If it plays A1: both get 3 points

Clearly A0 is optimal here.

**When 1 player delegates:**
If the mediator plays A0 for the single delegating player:
- That player commits to A0
- The non-delegating player's best response is A0
- Outcome: (5, 5) ✓

If the mediator plays A1:
- That player commits to A1
- The non-delegating player's best response is A1
- Outcome: (3, 3) - worse

## Step 4: Conclusion

A mediator that always plays A0 coordinates both players toward the efficient equilibrium (A0, A0), giving the maximum payoff. This is:
- Optimal for both players
- Symmetric and fair
- Most likely to win approval from both players

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (no mediator)

The game is a simultaneous-move 2-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|           | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (5,5)   | (0,3)   |
| **A1 (P1)** | (3,0)   | (3,3)   |

This is a **coordination game with conflict**:
- Mutual A0: best for both (5,5)
- If you pick A0 and other picks A1: you get 0, they get 3 (bad for you)
- If you pick A1 and other picks A0: you get 3, they get 0 (good for you, bad for them)
- Mutual A1: both get 3 — worse than (5,5), but better than 0.

**Pure strategy Nash equilibria**:
- (A0, A0): If both play A0, neither wants to deviate (if you deviate to A1, you get 3 instead of 5? No, 3 < 5 → so no incentive).
  - Wait: if P1 plays A0, P2's best response:
    - A0 → 5
    - A1 → 3 → so A0 is better.
  - So both prefer A0 → (A0, A0) is NE.

- (A1, A1): If P2 plays A1, P1:
  - A0 → 0
  - A1 → 3 → prefers A1
  - So yes, (A1, A1) is a NE.

- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, but if P1 switches to A1, gets 3 (better), so not equilibrium.

- (A1, A0): P2 gets 0, would prefer to switch to A1 → gets 3 → not NE.

So the only Nash equilibria are (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

But (A0,A0) is Pareto superior — gives 5 to each.

However, in the absence of coordination, players might fail to coordinate on A0.

---

### Step 2: Understanding the mediator

You are tasked with **proposing a mediator** — an entity that can be delegated to by players.

- You and the other player each propose a mediator.
- The mediator observes **how many players delegate** (1 or 2), and then plays **one action** that all delegators get.
- Only **one mediator** will be used, selected by approval voting.
- Winner: uniform random among those with **maximum approvals**.

You are Player 1. You want to **maximize your expected points**.

You choose a mediator **strategy**:
- For 1 delegator: what action does the mediator take?
- For 2 delegators: what action does the mediator take?

You write your mediator as a function:
```
{"1": <action>, "2": <action>}
```

You’ll tie this to the idea: **you want to maximize your chance of getting 5 points**, while possibly influencing the other player to approve your mediator.

---

### Step 3: Think about strategic delegation

You can propose any mediator behavior. But remember: the **other player** will also propose a mediator, and then both of you **vote** on mediators (you vote on your own and theirs; they vote on theirs and yours).

So the other player’s choice of mediator will be strategic, too.

But crucially: **you only control your own mediator proposal**.

You want to design a mediator that:
1. **Increases the chance of (A0,A0)** or **at least you getting high payoff**.
2. **Makes your mediator likely to be approved** by the other player.
   - Because if your mediator is approved by only one person, while the other gets two approvals, then the other mediator wins.

So your mediator must be **credible** and **attractive** to the other player.

---

### Step 4: What does the other player want?

They also want to maximize their own points.

So if you propose a mediator that gives **them high payoff in many cases**, they are more likely to approve your mediator.

---

### Step 5: Possible mediator strategies you could propose

Let’s consider possibilities.

#### Option 1: Always play A0
```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```
- If 1 player delegates: mediator plays A0 for them.
- If 2 players delegate: both get A0.

**Pros**:
- Guarantees mutual A0 when both delegate.
- If only you delegate, you play A0 → then you get 5 if the other plays A0, 0 if they play A1.
  - But if they don’t delegate, they play independently → their choice will be based on their view.
- But if only you delegate, then:
  - You get A0 (via mediator)
  - Other player plays independently.
  - Then if other plays A0: you get 5
  - If other plays A1: you get 0 → bad.

But from the other player’s point of view:
- If they delegate, they get A0 (if mediator is A0).
- If they don't delegate, they can choose A0 or A1 depending on what they think.

But if you propose A0 always, and they don’t delegate, they can still play A0 — so let’s suppose they are rational.

But if they think you might not delegate, and if Mutual A0 is likely, they may also prefer A0.

But **if they delegate**, they get A0 regardless.

And if they don’t delegate, they might play A1 to exploit you?

Wait: if they play A1 and you play A0, they get 3, which is better than 5? No: 3 < 5, so actually they prefer to coordinate on A0.

In fact, **for the other player, A0 is better than A1** if you’re playing A0:
- If you play A0, their best response is A0 (5) > A1 (3).

Similarly, if they play A0, your best response is A0.

So **the only incentive to play A1 is if they think you’ll play A0** — but they gain 3 instead of 5? No, they prefer 5.

So playing A1 is **never better** than A0 if the other plays A0.

Wait: actually, only if other player plays A0, A0 gives you 5, A1 gives 3 → A0 better.

But if other plays A1:
- You play A0 → get 0
- You play A1 → get 3 → so better to play A1.

So your best response depends.

But for the **other player**:
- If you play A0 → they get 5 if they play A0, 3 if A1 → prefer A0.
- If you play A1 → they get 0 if they play A0, 3 if A1 → prefer A1.

So their best response is a function of your play.

But **if you make it so that both of us get A0 when we delegate**, then we both get 5.

But the **other player** is rational and wants to maximize their own points.

So, would they approve your mediator that always plays A0?

Let’s suppose you propose:
```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```

Then, if the other player **delegates**, they get A0, and if you also delegate, you both get A0 → 5 each.

If they don’t delegate, and you do, they can still play A0 (since it’s best if you play A0), so they don’t gain much.

But if they **don’t delegate**, and you **do**, you play A0, they can still play A0 → get 5.

So whether they delegate or not doesn’t change their payoff if you are playing A0.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and they play A1, they might get 3 instead of 5 if you play A0.

Wait: the keys are: **only the delegating players** are represented by the mediator.

So:
- If **only you delegate**: you play A0 (via mediator), the other plays independently.
- If **only they delegate**: they play A0 (via mediator), you play independently.
- If **both delegate**: both play A0.
- If **neither delegate**: both play independently.

Now, back to the other player’s view of your mediator.

If they approve your mediator, and they **also delegate**, both get A0 → 5 each. Good for them.

If they don’t delegate, but you do: you play A0, they can play A0 → get 5, or A1 → get 3 → so they will play A0.

So they still get 5.

But if they **don’t delegate**, and you **don’t delegate**, then both play independently.

Now, what will happen?

If neither delegates, then game chooses actions independently.

What is the Nash equilibrium in this case?

We already saw: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

So possible outcomes:
- Both play A0: (5,5)
- Both play A1: (3,3)
- One plays A0, other A1: (0,3) or (3,0) — not stable

But if rational players choose best responses, and there's coordination failure, they might play (A1,A1) if they fear the other will play A1.

But since (A0,A0) is mutual best, and both prefer it, perhaps they coordinate.

But in the absence of commitment, they might fail.

But **if you propose a mediator that forces A0**, then **if both delegate**, you get (5,5).

Moreover, if **anyone delegates**, they get A0.

So the key is: does the other player have incentive to approve your mediator?

Yes — because if they delegate, they **guarantee** getting A0.

If they don’t delegate, they might be exploited (if you play A1, they get 0), but if you play A0, they get 5.

But if you play A1, they can play A1 to get 3 — but they don’t know.

But **if your mediator guarantees A0**, then the other player: if they don’t delegate, they must play A0 or A1.

But since they want to maximize points, and if they think you might play A1, they’d prefer A1.

But they don’t know your move.

So to **maximize their minimum payoff**, they might prefer to delegate.

But more importantly: **if they delegate to your mediator**, they are guaranteed A0, and then they get 5 if you play A0, or 3 if you play A1.

But if they **don’t delegate**, and they play A0, and you play A0 → 5 → same as delegating.

But if they play A0, and you play A1 → they get 0 → worse.

So by not delegating, they risk getting 0.

But if they delegate to your mediator, they get A0, and then the outcome depends on your action — but they avoid the risk of playing A1.

But if they don’t delegate, they can play A1 if they suspect you will play A1.

But the other player is rational.

Suppose you propose: mediator always plays A0.

Then the other player knows:
- If they delegate, they get A0 for sure.
- If they don’t, they can choose best response.

But the problem is: if they don’t delegate, they might choose A1 to avoid getting 0 if you play A1.

But if they play A1, and you play A0, they get 3 → worse than 5.

So their expected payoff depends on your choice.

But since they don’t know your behavior, they might avoid the risk.

But if you **force** both to A0 by full delegation, they get 5 for sure — better than possible 3 or 0.

So **they are better off delegating** if your mediator is A0 always.

Wait — not necessarily.

Suppose the other player thinks:
- If I delegate: I get A0.
  - If you play A0 → I get 5
  - If you play A1 → I get 0 → 3 (strictly worse than what you get? But I care about me)

They get 0 in that case.

But if they **don’t delegate**, they can play A1 and get 3 if you play A1, or 0 if you play A0.

So same as above.

But if they play A0 when not delegating, and you play A0: 5 — same as if they delegated.

But if you play A1: they get 0 (whether delegating or not, by playing A0).

But if they play A1, and you play A1: they get 3.

So:

| You | Me (no) | Me (yes) |
|-----|--------|--------|
| A0  | 0 (if I play A1), 5 (if A0) | 0 |
| A1  | 3 (if I play A1), 0 (if A0) | 3 |

So if they can play A1 when not delegating, and you play A1, they get 3.

But if they delegate, they get A0, so if you play A1, they get 0.

So they **prefer not to delegate** if they suspect you might play A1, because then they can get 3 by playing A1, whereas if they delegate, they get 0.

But if they delegate, they **must** play A0.

So **their payoff is lower if they delegate and you play A1**.

Therefore, they may **not want to delegate** to a mediator that forces A0, because it locks them into A0, and if you play A1, they get 0.

But if they play independently, they could play A1 and get 3.

So if they believe there’s a chance you’ll play A1, they prefer not to delegate — to keep flexibility.

Thus, **your mediator that always plays A0 may not be appealing to them**.

They might prefer a mediator that **only plays A0 when both delegate**, but doesn't lock them in.

Wait — but that's not the case.

Alternatively: what if you propose a mediator that **only commits to A0 when both delegate**, and makes no commitment otherwise?

But the mediator must choose a fixed strategy: for 1 delegate, what action? For 2, what?

So you cannot say “A0 if both delegate, A1 if one”.

But you could say: for 1 delegate, play A1?

But that might be worse.

Wait — let’s reconsider.

---

### Step 6: Key Insight — You want to **increase the chance of (A0,A0)**, but also make your mediator **appealing to the other player**.

The only way to **coordinate on (A0,A0)** is to **reduce uncertainty** and create commitment.

But if you **lock yourself** into A0, you are vulnerable if the other player plays A1 — you get 0.

But on the other hand, if you **don’t commit**, you might both end up in (A1,A1) or exploitative outcomes.

But (A1,A1) gives you 3, which is better than 0, but worse than 5.

---

### Step 7: Alternative mediator — "A0 if both delegate, A1 otherwise"

But you don’t control the other player’s choice.

Let’s try proposing:

```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```

So:
- If only one player delegates, mediator plays A1.
- If both delegate, mediator plays A0.

Why?

Because if **both delegate**, you get mutual A0 → 5 each.

If only one delegates, you get A1.

From the **other player’s perspective**, if they delegate, they get:
- A0 only if **both** delegate.

If they delegate and you don’t, they get A1.

So if they believe you will not delegate, they get A1 if they delegate.

But if they don’t delegate, they can play A0 or A1.

But let’s think from their point of view.

Suppose they are rational and want to maximize their payoff.

If they **delegate**, and you **do not**, they get A1.
- If you play A0: they get 0
- If you play A1: they get 3

So expected payoff depends on your choice.

But if they **don’t delegate**, they can play A1 to guarantee themselves 3 if you play A1, or A0 to get 5 if you play A0.

But if they play A1, and you play A0: they get 0 — same as if they delegated.

But if they play A1, and you play A1: they get 3.

So they might prefer to play A1 if they think you might play A0.

But if your mediator is: {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}, then if they delegate and you don’t, they get A1.

But if you align and both delegate, they get A0, and get 5 if you play A0.

But they don’t know.

But **if they think you might be strategic**, and they suspect you might **not delegate**, so that they get A1, then they might **not want to delegate**, because if they delegate and you don’t, they get A1 — same as if they don’t delegate and play A1.

But if they don’t delegate, they can still play A0 or A1.

But if they **don’t delegate**, they can adopt a strategy that matches yours.

But the key is: **if you both delegate, you get A0**.

So to **coordinate**, both must delegate.

But if the other player delegates, they get A0 only if you also delegate.

If they think you won’t delegate, they get A1.

So they might be reluctant to delegate.

But if they delegate, and you don’t, they get A1 — same as if they play A1 independently.

But if you **do** delegate, and they don’t, they can still play A0 — and if you play A0, they get 5.

But if they delegate, they are forced to A0.

So **if they delegate, they are committed to A0**.

But if they don't delegate, they can play A1 to avoid risk.

So again, **they may prefer not to delegate**, because they lose the ability to exploit.

For example: if they play A1 and you play A0, they get 3 (better than 0, if they were

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediator)

The game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with the following payoff matrix (from the perspective of **Player 2**, since you are Player 2):

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0        | A1        |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**                        | 5, 5      | 0, 3      |
| **A1**                        | 3, 0      | 3, 3      |

We are to maximize **our** points.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria of this game.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Nash Equilibria of the Base Game

Check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): You get 5. If you deviate to A1, you get 3 < 5 → no incentive. Opponent gets 5; if they deviate to A1, they get 3 < 5 → no incentive. So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): You get 0. If you switch to A1, you get 3 > 0 → so you’d deviate. Not NE.
- (A1, A0): You get 3. If you switch to A0, you get 5 > 3 → you’d deviate. Not NE.
- (A1, A1): You get 3. Opponent gets 3. If opponent switches to A0, they get 0 < 3 → no incentive. You: if switch to A0, you get 0 < 3 → no incentive. So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

So there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

Mixed strategy? Let’s see.

Let p = probability you play A0.
Let q = probability opponent plays A0.

For you to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- Expected payoff from A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- Expected payoff from A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5

So if opponent mixes with q = 3/5, you are indifferent.

Now for opponent to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- Opponent’s payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
- Opponent’s payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5

So there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both play A0 with probability 3/5.

But payoffs at equilibria:
- (A0,A0): 5,5
- (A1,A1): 3,3
- Mixed: you get 3 (since in mixed, you get 3 regardless of your action when opponent plays 0.6 A0)

So (A0,A0) gives **5** to you — the best possible payoff.

But the problem is: the other player may not cooperate. They might be rational and play strategically.

So in the base game, **you can’t guarantee a high payoff**, because the other player can choose (A1,A1) and lock you into 3 points, or even choose A1 when you pick A0 and give you 0.

So you need a **mechanism** to coordinate or enforce a better outcome — and that’s where the **mediator** comes in.

---

### Step 3: Understanding the Mediator Mechanism

- You can choose to **delegate** your decision to a mediator.
- The other player can do the same.
- **Only one mediator will be selected** (in a later approval voting step), based on how many approvals each mediator gets.

You are to **design a mediator** — a function that maps **number of delegators** (1 or 2) to a choice of action (A0 or A1) that the mediator will play on behalf of all delegating players.

So your mediator is defined as:
- If 1 player delegates → what should mediator play?
- If 2 players delegate → what should mediator play?

And you’re to design it **to maximize your expected points**, knowing:
- The other player will also design a mediator.
- Then both mediators will be voted on via approval voting — you and the other player each approve some mediators, and the one with **most approvals** wins (chosen uniformly at random from those tied for most).
- Then the winning mediator is applied: all delegating players are moved by that mediator.

So your goal: design a mediator that makes you want to **delegating** and that **others want to delegate to** (or approve), so your mediator is more likely to be selected.

But: you are **Player 2**. You are not the first to act.

---

### Step 4: Strategic Design of the Mediator

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, so your mediator should ideally:
- Encourage both players to delegate to it.
- Ensure that when it’s selected, you get a high payoff.

Let’s consider possible mediator behaviors.

#### Option 1: Always play A0

- If 1 player delegates → mediator plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

This would lead to (A0, A0) if both delegate → you get 5.

But: suppose you delegate, but the other player doesn’t — then you play A0 (via mediator), they play what they want. If they play A1, you get 0. Bad.

So the key is: **you want to incentivize delegation** and coordinate a good outcome.

#### Option 2: Play A0 only if 2 delegate; otherwise play A1?

That seems risky.

Better idea: **design a mediator that rewards cooperation**.

---

### Step 5: Think About What a Rational Other Player Would Want

The other player is also trying to maximize their own payoff.

They will choose a mediator that, if selected, gives **them** a high payoff **given their beliefs about your actions**.

So you must propose a mediator that:
- Gives a high payoff to both players in the cooperative case (i.e., both delegating),
- Is beneficial enough that the other player would want to **approve** it,
- And that you would want to **delegate to it**.

---

### Step 6: Design a Mediator That Encourages Both to Delegates and Plays (A0, A0)

The best possible outcome is (A0,A0): you get 5.

But if only one delegates, and the mediator plays A0, then:
- If you delegate, you play A0.
- If the other doesn't delegate, they can play A1 and cause you to get 0.

So a mediator that always plays A0 when 1 person delegates is **very risky**.

Similarly, if the other player delegates to a mediator that plays A1, they might be worse off.

So consider **a mediator that plays A0 only if both delegate**.

But what if only one delegates?

Then mediator cannot play a fixed action — it’s a fixed action based on number of delegators.

So you have to define an action for **1 delegate** and **2 delegates**.

Let’s consider this:

#### Proposed Mediator Design:

- If 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Why?

- If both delegate → outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 5, opponent gets 5.
- If only one delegates → they play A1.

Now, how does this affect the other player?

Suppose you propose this mediator.

Would they want to delegate?

- If the opponent **does not delegate**, then they can play either A0 or A1.
- If they play A0, and you play A1 → you get 3, they get 0 → they lose.
- If they play A1 → you get 3, they get 3.

So best for them if they play A1 → get 3.

But if you delegate to this mediator, you play A1 (because only one delegate → mediator plays A1).

So if you delegate and they don’t, outcome is (A1, whatever they play).

- If they play A0 → you get 3, they get 0
- If they play A1 → you get 3, they get 3

So they prefer to play A1 to get 3 instead of 0.

So if the other player plays independently and you delegate, then final action is (A1, A1) → you get 3.

But if they also delegate, then both are moved to A0 → you get 5.

So the **other player** would get:
- 0 if they play A0 and you play A1
- 3 if they play A1 → same as if they don't delegate

But if both delegate, they get **5**, which is better.

So the **incentive** for the other player is: **if I delegate to this mediator, and you do too, we both get 5**.

But if only I delegate, I play A1, and depending on your action, I get 3 or 0.

Wait — but if I delegate and you don’t, then they get A1 (your action) — and I play A1 (via mediator), so (A1, A1) — I get 3.

But if I don’t delegate and play A1, same thing.

So **no loss** in delegating when only one delegates.

But **gain** if both delegate: 5 instead of 3.

So the other player **has incentive to delegate** — because:
- If they don’t delegate, they get at most 5 if you play A0 (but they don’t control that).
- But by delegating, they guarantee playing A1 if only one delegate → still get 3 or more.
- And if both delegate → get 5.

So **delegation is strictly better for them** only if they believe you will also delegate.

But **they don't know**.

So need to ask: would the other player **approve** this mediator?

They would approve only if they believe it gives them a higher expected payoff.

Suppose they are risk-averse or think you might not delegate.

But you are designing **your own mediator**, and you want **you** and **them** to approve it.

So think differently.

---

### Step 7: Use a Mediator That Plays A0 When 2 Delegate, and A1 When 1 Delegate

Let’s define:
- M(1) = “A1”
- M(2) = “A0”

As above.

Now, **if both players delegate to this mediator**, then both play A0 → you get 5.

Suppose you **delegate** to this mediator.

Then regardless of whether the other person delegates or not, you **play A1 if they don’t delegate**, or A0 if they do.

So your expected payoff depends on whether they delegate.

But they decide whether to delegate and whether to approve your mediator.

Now, suppose the other player is rational and wants to maximize their payoff.

They will compare:
- What happens if they **don’t delegate**?
- What happens if they **delegate** to your mediator?

But they don’t know if you will delegate.

So perhaps you need a mediator that is **credible** and makes it **beneficial for them to approve**.

Key insight: if both players believe that if **both** delegate to the same mediator, then (A0, A0) happens, and that’s better than other outcomes, then both players may want to **approve** that mediator.

But your mediator **only plays A0 if 2 delegate**.

So if the other player **delegates**, and you do, both play A0 → good.

But if only one delegates, then player X plays A1.

So suppose you design such a mediator.

Let’s suppose you propose it.

**Would the other player approve it?**

Yes, if they believe you will also delegate — because then they get 5.

Alternatively, if they don’t delegate, they get 3 (if they play A1), but possibly 0 if they play A0.

So their best strategy is to play A1 if you don’t delegate — which gives them 3.

But if they delegate to your mediator and you do too, they get 5 — better.

So they have **incentive to delegate**, assuming you will.

But how to make them believe you will?

Perhaps you can **commit** to delegating to this mediator — but you can’t signal directly.

But in this structure, **you propose the mediator**, and the voting is about **approval**.

So to get approval, you need to make **it look optimal for them** to approve it.

But let's consider what the **best outcome** is: (A0, A0), both get 5.

So any mediator that **can achieve (A0, A0) when both delegate** and **doesn’t punish them if only one delegates** is good.

But if only one delegates and the mediator plays A1, the delegator gets 3 or 0, depending on the other.

But worst case, if the other plays A0 and you play A1 → you get 3, they get 0.

So if the other player delegates and you don’t, they get 0 only if you play A0? Wait no:

Let’s clarify:

- You delegate to your mediator.
- Mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate).
- You play A1.
- Other player plays independently.

If other player plays A0 → you get 0, they get 3.
If other player plays A1 → you get 3, they get 3.

So for them, if you are playing A1, they get 3 no matter what (by playing A1), and only get 0 if they play A0.

So best for them is to play A1.

But that’s better than nothing.

So by delegating, they avoid getting 0 (if they played A0 by mistake), but they only get 3 instead of 5.

So they get 3 if they delegate and you don’t.

But if they don’t delegate, and you do, they get either 3 (if they play A1) or 0 (if they play A0).

So as long as they play A1, it’s the same payoff.

So they have no loss by delegating.

And they gain 5 if both delegate.

So **they have an incentive to delegate**, assuming you will.

So if you propose a mediator that:
- Plays A1 if only one delegate (so you both play A1 → 3,3) — but wait, no: only you play A1, they play freely.

Wait — if you delegate, you play A1.

The other player, if they don’t delegate, can still play A0 or A1.

So the worst they can get is 0 if they play A0 and you play A1.

But they won’t do that — they’ll play A1.

So they get 3.

But if both delegate, they get 5.

So they are **better off** if you delegate and they do.

But they don’t know if you will.

So to get them to **approve** your mediator, you need to make it **in their interest to approve**.

One way: design a mediator that is **Pareto superior** in all cases.

But that’s hard.

Better idea: **design a mediator that plays A0 if 2 delegate, and A0 if 1 delegate**?

Then:
- If only one delegate → A0
- If both delegate → A0

Then outcome is (A0, A0) only if the non-delegator also plays A0.

But if the non-delegator plays A1, then you get (A0, A1) → you get 0, they get 3.

So again, they can harm you.

So not good.

But if both play A0 regardless, you get 5,5.

So suppose you propose:
- M(1) = "A0"
- M(2) = "A0"

Then:
- If both delegate → (A0, A0) → you get 5
- If only one delegates → that player plays A0, the other plays freely.

If the other plays A1 → you get 0 (if you are delegate) or 3 (if you are not).

So if you delegate, and other plays A1 → you get 0.

So you have incentive to delegate only if you believe the other will play A0.

But they won’t, because they get 3 by playing A1.

So they’ll play A1.

So if you delegate and other doesn’t, you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0.

So you get **0** in that case.

Bad.

But if both delegate, you get 5.

So you may still want to delegate — if you believe they will.

But they get only 3 if you don’t delegate and you play A0 — but they get 5 if both delegate.

So they have incentive to delegate, hoping you do.

But you’re both cautious.

But if no player wants to be first to delegate, you get stuck in (A1,A1) → 3,3.

But (A0,A0) is better.

So the mediator needs to **solve the coordination problem**.

Best solution: **design a mediator that only plays A0 when both delegate**.

But if only one delegates, it plays something that doesn't punish the delegator too much.

But if it plays A1 when only one delegate, then:
- If you delegate, you play A1.
- If the other doesn’t delegate, they play A1 → (A1,A1) → you get 3.

So you get 3.

But if both delegate, you get 5.

So you are better off if both delegate.

But if you are the only one to delegate, you get 3 (if other plays A1), which is better than 0, which you'd get if other plays A0.

So no loss.

But the other player, if they delegate and you don't, they play A1, you play freely.

If you play A0 → they get 0.
If you play A1 → they get 3.

So they get 0 or 3 depending on you.

To avoid risk, they might not delegate.

But if you are rational and you delegate to this mediator, you end up playing A1, so if they delegate, they play A1, you play A1 → (A1,A1) → they get 3.

But if both delegate to this mediator, they get 5.

So they get 3 if they delegate but you don’t, or 5 if you do.

So they are better off if you delegate.

But again, they don't know.

So perhaps the key is to **avoid

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be a mediator for this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A mediator is an entity that plays actions on behalf of delegating players.
- Each player may choose to delegate their move to the mediator or act independently.
- The mediator observes the number of players delegating to the mediator and then plays the same action for all delegating players.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a mediator. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Your previous response was:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediator)

The game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with the following payoff matrix (from the perspective of **Player 2**, since you are Player 2):

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0        | A1        |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**                        | 5, 5      | 0, 3      |
| **A1**                        | 3, 0      | 3, 3      |

We are to maximize **our** points.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria of this game.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Nash Equilibria of the Base Game

Check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): You get 5. If you deviate to A1, you get 3 < 5 → no incentive. Opponent gets 5; if they deviate to A1, they get 3 < 5 → no incentive. So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): You get 0. If you switch to A1, you get 3 > 0 → so you’d deviate. Not NE.
- (A1, A0): You get 3. If you switch to A0, you get 5 > 3 → you’d deviate. Not NE.
- (A1, A1): You get 3. Opponent gets 3. If opponent switches to A0, they get 0 < 3 → no incentive. You: if switch to A0, you get 0 < 3 → no incentive. So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

So there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

Mixed strategy? Let’s see.

Let p = probability you play A0.
Let q = probability opponent plays A0.

For you to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- Expected payoff from A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- Expected payoff from A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5

So if opponent mixes with q = 3/5, you are indifferent.

Now for opponent to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- Opponent’s payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
- Opponent’s payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5

So there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both play A0 with probability 3/5.

But payoffs at equilibria:
- (A0,A0): 5,5
- (A1,A1): 3,3
- Mixed: you get 3 (since in mixed, you get 3 regardless of your action when opponent plays 0.6 A0)

So (A0,A0) gives **5** to you — the best possible payoff.

But the problem is: the other player may not cooperate. They might be rational and play strategically.

So in the base game, **you can’t guarantee a high payoff**, because the other player can choose (A1,A1) and lock you into 3 points, or even choose A1 when you pick A0 and give you 0.

So you need a **mechanism** to coordinate or enforce a better outcome — and that’s where the **mediator** comes in.

---

### Step 3: Understanding the Mediator Mechanism

- You can choose to **delegate** your decision to a mediator.
- The other player can do the same.
- **Only one mediator will be selected** (in a later approval voting step), based on how many approvals each mediator gets.

You are to **design a mediator** — a function that maps **number of delegators** (1 or 2) to a choice of action (A0 or A1) that the mediator will play on behalf of all delegating players.

So your mediator is defined as:
- If 1 player delegates → what should mediator play?
- If 2 players delegate → what should mediator play?

And you’re to design it **to maximize your expected points**, knowing:
- The other player will also design a mediator.
- Then both mediators will be voted on via approval voting — you and the other player each approve some mediators, and the one with **most approvals** wins (chosen uniformly at random from those tied for most).
- Then the winning mediator is applied: all delegating players are moved by that mediator.

So your goal: design a mediator that makes you want to **delegating** and that **others want to delegate to** (or approve), so your mediator is more likely to be selected.

But: you are **Player 2**. You are not the first to act.

---

### Step 4: Strategic Design of the Mediator

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, so your mediator should ideally:
- Encourage both players to delegate to it.
- Ensure that when it’s selected, you get a high payoff.

Let’s consider possible mediator behaviors.

#### Option 1: Always play A0

- If 1 player delegates → mediator plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

This would lead to (A0, A0) if both delegate → you get 5.

But: suppose you delegate, but the other player doesn’t — then you play A0 (via mediator), they play what they want. If they play A1, you get 0. Bad.

So the key is: **you want to incentivize delegation** and coordinate a good outcome.

#### Option 2: Play A0 only if 2 delegate; otherwise play A1?

That seems risky.

Better idea: **design a mediator that rewards cooperation**.

---

### Step 5: Think About What a Rational Other Player Would Want

The other player is also trying to maximize their own payoff.

They will choose a mediator that, if selected, gives **them** a high payoff **given their beliefs about your actions**.

So you must propose a mediator that:
- Gives a high payoff to both players in the cooperative case (i.e., both delegating),
- Is beneficial enough that the other player would want to **approve** it,
- And that you would want to **delegate to it**.

---

### Step 6: Design a Mediator That Encourages Both to Delegates and Plays (A0, A0)

The best possible outcome is (A0,A0): you get 5.

But if only one delegates, and the mediator plays A0, then:
- If you delegate, you play A0.
- If the other doesn't delegate, they can play A1 and cause you to get 0.

So a mediator that always plays A0 when 1 person delegates is **very risky**.

Similarly, if the other player delegates to a mediator that plays A1, they might be worse off.

So consider **a mediator that plays A0 only if both delegate**.

But what if only one delegates?

Then mediator cannot play a fixed action — it’s a fixed action based on number of delegators.

So you have to define an action for **1 delegate** and **2 delegates**.

Let’s consider this:

#### Proposed Mediator Design:

- If 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Why?

- If both delegate → outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 5, opponent gets 5.
- If only one delegates → they play A1.

Now, how does this affect the other player?

Suppose you propose this mediator.

Would they want to delegate?

- If the opponent **does not delegate**, then they can play either A0 or A1.
- If they play A0, and you play A1 → you get 3, they get 0 → they lose.
- If they play A1 → you get 3, they get 3.

So best for them if they play A1 → get 3.

But if you delegate to this mediator, you play A1 (because only one delegate → mediator plays A1).

So if you delegate and they don’t, outcome is (A1, whatever they play).

- If they play A0 → you get 3, they get 0
- If they play A1 → you get 3, they get 3

So they prefer to play A1 to get 3 instead of 0.

So if the other player plays independently and you delegate, then final action is (A1, A1) → you get 3.

But if they also delegate, then both are moved to A0 → you get 5.

So the **other player** would get:
- 0 if they play A0 and you play A1
- 3 if they play A1 → same as if they don't delegate

But if both delegate, they get **5**, which is better.

So the **incentive** for the other player is: **if I delegate to this mediator, and you do too, we both get 5**.

But if only I delegate, I play A1, and depending on your action, I get 3 or 0.

Wait — but if I delegate and you don’t, then they get A1 (your action) — and I play A1 (via mediator), so (A1, A1) — I get 3.

But if I don’t delegate and play A1, same thing.

So **no loss** in delegating when only one delegates.

But **gain** if both delegate: 5 instead of 3.

So the other player **has incentive to delegate** — because:
- If they don’t delegate, they get at most 5 if you play A0 (but they don’t control that).
- But by delegating, they guarantee playing A1 if only one delegate → still get 3 or more.
- And if both delegate → get 5.

So **delegation is strictly better for them** only if they believe you will also delegate.

But **they don't know**.

So need to ask: would the other player **approve** this mediator?

They would approve only if they believe it gives them a higher expected payoff.

Suppose they are risk-averse or think you might not delegate.

But you are designing **your own mediator**, and you want **you** and **them** to approve it.

So think differently.

---

### Step 7: Use a Mediator That Plays A0 When 2 Delegate, and A1 When 1 Delegate

Let’s define:
- M(1) = “A1”
- M(2) = “A0”

As above.

Now, **if both players delegate to this mediator**, then both play A0 → you get 5.

Suppose you **delegate** to this mediator.

Then regardless of whether the other person delegates or not, you **play A1 if they don’t delegate**, or A0 if they do.

So your expected payoff depends on whether they delegate.

But they decide whether to delegate and whether to approve your mediator.

Now, suppose the other player is rational and wants to maximize their payoff.

They will compare:
- What happens if they **don’t delegate**?
- What happens if they **delegate** to your mediator?

But they don’t know if you will delegate.

So perhaps you need a mediator that is **credible** and makes it **beneficial for them to approve**.

Key insight: if both players believe that if **both** delegate to the same mediator, then (A0, A0) happens, and that’s better than other outcomes, then both players may want to **approve** that mediator.

But your mediator **only plays A0 if 2 delegate**.

So if the other player **delegates**, and you do, both play A0 → good.

But if only one delegates, then player X plays A1.

So suppose you design such a mediator.

Let’s suppose you propose it.

**Would the other player approve it?**

Yes, if they believe you will also delegate — because then they get 5.

Alternatively, if they don’t delegate, they get 3 (if they play A1), but possibly 0 if they play A0.

So their best strategy is to play A1 if you don’t delegate — which gives them 3.

But if they delegate to your mediator and you do too, they get 5 — better.

So they have **incentive to delegate**, assuming you will.

But how to make them believe you will?

Perhaps you can **commit** to delegating to this mediator — but you can’t signal directly.

But in this structure, **you propose the mediator**, and the voting is about **approval**.

So to get approval, you need to make **it look optimal for them** to approve it.

But let's consider what the **best outcome** is: (A0, A0), both get 5.

So any mediator that **can achieve (A0, A0) when both delegate** and **doesn’t punish them if only one delegates** is good.

But if only one delegates and the mediator plays A1, the delegator gets 3 or 0, depending on the other.

But worst case, if the other plays A0 and you play A1 → you get 3, they get 0.

So if the other player delegates and you don’t, they get 0 only if you play A0? Wait no:

Let’s clarify:

- You delegate to your mediator.
- Mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate).
- You play A1.
- Other player plays independently.

If other player plays A0 → you get 0, they get 3.
If other player plays A1 → you get 3, they get 3.

So for them, if you are playing A1, they get 3 no matter what (by playing A1), and only get 0 if they play A0.

So best for them is to play A1.

But that’s better than nothing.

So by delegating, they avoid getting 0 (if they played A0 by mistake), but they only get 3 instead of 5.

So they get 3 if they delegate and you don’t.

But if they don’t delegate, and you do, they get either 3 (if they play A1) or 0 (if they play A0).

So as long as they play A1, it’s the same payoff.

So they have no loss by delegating.

And they gain 5 if both delegate.

So **they have an incentive to delegate**, assuming you will.

So if you propose a mediator that:
- Plays A1 if only one delegate (so you both play A1 → 3,3) — but wait, no: only you play A1, they play freely.

Wait — if you delegate, you play A1.

The other player, if they don’t delegate, can still play A0 or A1.

So the worst they can get is 0 if they play A0 and you play A1.

But they won’t do that — they’ll play A1.

So they get 3.

But if both delegate, they get 5.

So they are **better off** if you delegate and they do.

But they don’t know if you will.

So to get them to **approve** your mediator, you need to make it **in their interest to approve**.

One way: design a mediator that is **Pareto superior** in all cases.

But that’s hard.

Better idea: **design a mediator that plays A0 if 2 delegate, and A0 if 1 delegate**?

Then:
- If only one delegate → A0
- If both delegate → A0

Then outcome is (A0, A0) only if the non-delegator also plays A0.

But if the non-delegator plays A1, then you get (A0, A1) → you get 0, they get 3.

So again, they can harm you.

So not good.

But if both play A0 regardless, you get 5,5.

So suppose you propose:
- M(1) = "A0"
- M(2) = "A0"

Then:
- If both delegate → (A0, A0) → you get 5
- If only one delegates → that player plays A0, the other plays freely.

If the other plays A1 → you get 0 (if you are delegate) or 3 (if you are not).

So if you delegate, and other plays A1 → you get 0.

So you have incentive to delegate only if you believe the other will play A0.

But they won’t, because they get 3 by playing A1.

So they’ll play A1.

So if you delegate and other doesn’t, you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0.

So you get **0** in that case.

Bad.

But if both delegate, you get 5.

So you may still want to delegate — if you believe they will.

But they get only 3 if you don’t delegate and you play A0 — but they get 5 if both delegate.

So they have incentive to delegate, hoping you do.

But you’re both cautious.

But if no player wants to be first to delegate, you get stuck in (A1,A1) → 3,3.

But (A0,A0) is better.

So the mediator needs to **solve the coordination problem**.

Best solution: **design a mediator that only plays A0 when both delegate**.

But if only one delegates, it plays something that doesn't punish the delegator too much.

But if it plays A1 when only one delegate, then:
- If you delegate, you play A1.
- If the other doesn’t delegate, they play A1 → (A1,A1) → you get 3.

So you get 3.

But if both delegate, you get 5.

So you are better off if both delegate.

But if you are the only one to delegate, you get 3 (if other plays A1), which is better than 0, which you'd get if other plays A0.

So no loss.

But the other player, if they delegate and you don't, they play A1, you play freely.

If you play A0 → they get 0.
If you play A1 → they get 3.

So they get 0 or 3 depending on you.

To avoid risk, they might not delegate.

But if you are rational and you delegate to this mediator, you end up playing A1, so if they delegate, they play A1, you play A1 → (A1,A1) → they get 3.

But if both delegate to this mediator, they get 5.

So they get 3 if they delegate but you don’t, or 5 if you do.

So they are better off if you delegate.

But again, they don't know.

So perhaps the key is to **avoid

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in the response 'Let\'s break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediator)\n\nThe game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with the following payoff matrix (from the perspective of **Player 2**, since you are Player 2):\n\n| Your Action \\ Opponent\'s Action | A0        | A1        |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **A0**                        | 5, 5      | 0, 3      |\n| **A1**                        | 3, 0      | 3, 3      |\n\nWe are to maximize **our** points.\n\nLet’s analyze the Nash equilibria of this game.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Nash Equilibria of the Base Game\n\nCheck for pure strategy Nash equilibria:\n\n- (A0, A0): You get 5. If you deviate to A1, you get 3 < 5 → no incentive. Opponent gets 5; if they deviate to A1, they get 3 < 5 → no incentive. So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.\n- (A0, A1): You get 0. If you switch to A1, you get 3 > 0 → so you’d deviate. Not NE.\n- (A1, A0): You get 3. If you switch to A0, you get 5 > 3 → you’d deviate. Not NE.\n- (A1, A1): You get 3. Opponent gets 3. If opponent switches to A0, they get 0 < 3 → no incentive. You: if switch to A0, you get 0 < 3 → no incentive. So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.\n\nSo there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).\n\nMixed strategy? Let’s see.\n\nLet p = probability you play A0.\nLet q = probability opponent plays A0.\n\nFor you to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\n- Expected payoff from A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q\n- Expected payoff from A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3\n\nSet equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5\n\nSo if opponent mixes with q = 3/5, you are indifferent.\n\nNow for opponent to be indifferent between A0 and A1:\n- Opponent’s payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p\n- Opponent’s payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3\n\nSet equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5\n\nSo there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both play A0 with probability 3/5.\n\nBut payoffs at equilibria:\n- (A0,A0): 5,5\n- (A1,A1): 3,3\n- Mixed: you get 3 (since in mixed, you get 3 regardless of your action when opponent plays 0.6 A0)\n\nSo (A0,A0) gives **5** to you — the best possible payoff.\n\nBut the problem is: the other player may not cooperate. They might be rational and play strategically.\n\nSo in the base game, **you can’t guarantee a high payoff**, because the other player can choose (A1,A1) and lock you into 3 points, or even choose A1 when you pick A0 and give you 0.\n\nSo you need a **mechanism** to coordinate or enforce a better outcome — and that’s where the **mediator** comes in.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the Mediator Mechanism\n\n- You can choose to **delegate** your decision to a mediator.\n- The other player can do the same.\n- **Only one mediator will be selected** (in a later approval voting step), based on how many approvals each mediator gets.\n\nYou are to **design a mediator** — a function that maps **number of delegators** (1 or 2) to a choice of action (A0 or A1) that the mediator will play on behalf of all delegating players.\n\nSo your mediator is defined as:\n- If 1 player delegates → what should mediator play?\n- If 2 players delegate → what should mediator play?\n\nAnd you’re to design it **to maximize your expected points**, knowing:\n- The other player will also design a mediator.\n- Then both mediators will be voted on via approval voting — you and the other player each approve some mediators, and the one with **most approvals** wins (chosen uniformly at random from those tied for most).\n- Then the winning mediator is applied: all delegating players are moved by that mediator.\n\nSo your goal: design a mediator that makes you want to **delegating** and that **others want to delegate to** (or approve), so your mediator is more likely to be selected.\n\nBut: you are **Player 2**. You are not the first to act.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Strategic Design of the Mediator\n\nYou want to **maximize your expected payoff**, so your mediator should ideally:\n- Encourage both players to delegate to it.\n- Ensure that when it’s selected, you get a high payoff.\n\nLet’s consider possible mediator behaviors.\n\n#### Option 1: Always play A0\n\n- If 1 player delegates → mediator plays A0\n- If 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0\n\nThis would lead to (A0, A0) if both delegate → you get 5.\n\nBut: suppose you delegate, but the other player doesn’t — then you play A0 (via mediator), they play what they want. If they play A1, you get 0. Bad.\n\nSo the key is: **you want to incentivize delegation** and coordinate a good outcome.\n\n#### Option 2: Play A0 only if 2 delegate; otherwise play A1?\n\nThat seems risky.\n\nBetter idea: **design a mediator that rewards cooperation**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Think About What a Rational Other Player Would Want\n\nThe other player is also trying to maximize their own payoff.\n\nThey will choose a mediator that, if selected, gives **them** a high payoff **given their beliefs about your actions**.\n\nSo you must propose a mediator that:\n- Gives a high payoff to both players in the cooperative case (i.e., both delegating),\n- Is beneficial enough that the other player would want to **approve** it,\n- And that you would want to **delegate to it**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Design a Mediator That Encourages Both to Delegates and Plays (A0, A0)\n\nThe best possible outcome is (A0,A0): you get 5.\n\nBut if only one delegates, and the mediator plays A0, then:\n- If you delegate, you play A0.\n- If the other doesn\'t delegate, they can play A1 and cause you to get 0.\n\nSo a mediator that always plays A0 when 1 person delegates is **very risky**.\n\nSimilarly, if the other player delegates to a mediator that plays A1, they might be worse off.\n\nSo consider **a mediator that plays A0 only if both delegate**.\n\nBut what if only one delegates?\n\nThen mediator cannot play a fixed action — it’s a fixed action based on number of delegators.\n\nSo you have to define an action for **1 delegate** and **2 delegates**.\n\nLet’s consider this:\n\n#### Proposed Mediator Design:\n\n- If 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1**\n- If 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0**\n\nWhy?\n\n- If both delegate → outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 5, opponent gets 5.\n- If only one delegates → they play A1.\n\nNow, how does this affect the other player?\n\nSuppose you propose this mediator.\n\nWould they want to delegate?\n\n- If the opponent **does not delegate**, then they can play either A0 or A1.\n- If they play A0, and you play A1 → you get 3, they get 0 → they lose.\n- If they play A1 → you get 3, they get 3.\n\nSo best for them if they play A1 → get 3.\n\nBut if you delegate to this mediator, you play A1 (because only one delegate → mediator plays A1).\n\nSo if you delegate and they don’t, outcome is (A1, whatever they play).\n\n- If they play A0 → you get 3, they get 0\n- If they play A1 → you get 3, they get 3\n\nSo they prefer to play A1 to get 3 instead of 0.\n\nSo if the other player plays independently and you delegate, then final action is (A1, A1) → you get 3.\n\nBut if they also delegate, then both are moved to A0 → you get 5.\n\nSo the **other player** would get:\n- 0 if they play A0 and you play A1\n- 3 if they play A1 → same as if they don\'t delegate\n\nBut if both delegate, they get **5**, which is better.\n\nSo the **incentive** for the other player is: **if I delegate to this mediator, and you do too, we both get 5**.\n\nBut if only I delegate, I play A1, and depending on your action, I get 3 or 0.\n\nWait — but if I delegate and you don’t, then they get A1 (your action) — and I play A1 (via mediator), so (A1, A1) — I get 3.\n\nBut if I don’t delegate and play A1, same thing.\n\nSo **no loss** in delegating when only one delegates.\n\nBut **gain** if both delegate: 5 instead of 3.\n\nSo the other player **has incentive to delegate** — because:\n- If they don’t delegate, they get at most 5 if you play A0 (but they don’t control that).\n- But by delegating, they guarantee playing A1 if only one delegate → still get 3 or more.\n- And if both delegate → get 5.\n\nSo **delegation is strictly better for them** only if they believe you will also delegate.\n\nBut **they don\'t know**.\n\nSo need to ask: would the other player **approve** this mediator?\n\nThey would approve only if they believe it gives them a higher expected payoff.\n\nSuppose they are risk-averse or think you might not delegate.\n\nBut you are designing **your own mediator**, and you want **you** and **them** to approve it.\n\nSo think differently.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Use a Mediator That Plays A0 When 2 Delegate, and A1 When 1 Delegate\n\nLet’s define:\n- M(1) = “A1”\n- M(2) = “A0”\n\nAs above.\n\nNow, **if both players delegate to this mediator**, then both play A0 → you get 5.\n\nSuppose you **delegate** to this mediator.\n\nThen regardless of whether the other person delegates or not, you **play A1 if they don’t delegate**, or A0 if they do.\n\nSo your expected payoff depends on whether they delegate.\n\nBut they decide whether to delegate and whether to approve your mediator.\n\nNow, suppose the other player is rational and wants to maximize their payoff.\n\nThey will compare:\n- What happens if they **don’t delegate**?\n- What happens if they **delegate** to your mediator?\n\nBut they don’t know if you will delegate.\n\nSo perhaps you need a mediator that is **credible** and makes it **beneficial for them to approve**.\n\nKey insight: if both players believe that if **both** delegate to the same mediator, then (A0, A0) happens, and that’s better than other outcomes, then both players may want to **approve** that mediator.\n\nBut your mediator **only plays A0 if 2 delegate**.\n\nSo if the other player **delegates**, and you do, both play A0 → good.\n\nBut if only one delegates, then player X plays A1.\n\nSo suppose you design such a mediator.\n\nLet’s suppose you propose it.\n\n**Would the other player approve it?**\n\nYes, if they believe you will also delegate — because then they get 5.\n\nAlternatively, if they don’t delegate, they get 3 (if they play A1), but possibly 0 if they play A0.\n\nSo their best strategy is to play A1 if you don’t delegate — which gives them 3.\n\nBut if they delegate to your mediator and you do too, they get 5 — better.\n\nSo they have **incentive to delegate**, assuming you will.\n\nBut how to make them believe you will?\n\nPerhaps you can **commit** to delegating to this mediator — but you can’t signal directly.\n\nBut in this structure, **you propose the mediator**, and the voting is about **approval**.\n\nSo to get approval, you need to make **it look optimal for them** to approve it.\n\nBut let\'s consider what the **best outcome** is: (A0, A0), both get 5.\n\nSo any mediator that **can achieve (A0, A0) when both delegate** and **doesn’t punish them if only one delegates** is good.\n\nBut if only one delegates and the mediator plays A1, the delegator gets 3 or 0, depending on the other.\n\nBut worst case, if the other plays A0 and you play A1 → you get 3, they get 0.\n\nSo if the other player delegates and you don’t, they get 0 only if you play A0? Wait no:\n\nLet’s clarify:\n\n- You delegate to your mediator.\n- Mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate).\n- You play A1.\n- Other player plays independently.\n\nIf other player plays A0 → you get 0, they get 3.\nIf other player plays A1 → you get 3, they get 3.\n\nSo for them, if you are playing A1, they get 3 no matter what (by playing A1), and only get 0 if they play A0.\n\nSo best for them is to play A1.\n\nBut that’s better than nothing.\n\nSo by delegating, they avoid getting 0 (if they played A0 by mistake), but they only get 3 instead of 5.\n\nSo they get 3 if they delegate and you don’t.\n\nBut if they don’t delegate, and you do, they get either 3 (if they play A1) or 0 (if they play A0).\n\nSo as long as they play A1, it’s the same payoff.\n\nSo they have no loss by delegating.\n\nAnd they gain 5 if both delegate.\n\nSo **they have an incentive to delegate**, assuming you will.\n\nSo if you propose a mediator that:\n- Plays A1 if only one delegate (so you both play A1 → 3,3) — but wait, no: only you play A1, they play freely.\n\nWait — if you delegate, you play A1.\n\nThe other player, if they don’t delegate, can still play A0 or A1.\n\nSo the worst they can get is 0 if they play A0 and you play A1.\n\nBut they won’t do that — they’ll play A1.\n\nSo they get 3.\n\nBut if both delegate, they get 5.\n\nSo they are **better off** if you delegate and they do.\n\nBut they don’t know if you will.\n\nSo to get them to **approve** your mediator, you need to make it **in their interest to approve**.\n\nOne way: design a mediator that is **Pareto superior** in all cases.\n\nBut that’s hard.\n\nBetter idea: **design a mediator that plays A0 if 2 delegate, and A0 if 1 delegate**?\n\nThen:\n- If only one delegate → A0\n- If both delegate → A0\n\nThen outcome is (A0, A0) only if the non-delegator also plays A0.\n\nBut if the non-delegator plays A1, then you get (A0, A1) → you get 0, they get 3.\n\nSo again, they can harm you.\n\nSo not good.\n\nBut if both play A0 regardless, you get 5,5.\n\nSo suppose you propose:\n- M(1) = "A0"\n- M(2) = "A0"\n\nThen:\n- If both delegate → (A0, A0) → you get 5\n- If only one delegates → that player plays A0, the other plays freely.\n\nIf the other plays A1 → you get 0 (if you are delegate) or 3 (if you are not).\n\nSo if you delegate, and other plays A1 → you get 0.\n\nSo you have incentive to delegate only if you believe the other will play A0.\n\nBut they won’t, because they get 3 by playing A1.\n\nSo they’ll play A1.\n\nSo if you delegate and other doesn’t, you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0.\n\nSo you get **0** in that case.\n\nBad.\n\nBut if both delegate, you get 5.\n\nSo you may still want to delegate — if you believe they will.\n\nBut they get only 3 if you don’t delegate and you play A0 — but they get 5 if both delegate.\n\nSo they have incentive to delegate, hoping you do.\n\nBut you’re both cautious.\n\nBut if no player wants to be first to delegate, you get stuck in (A1,A1) → 3,3.\n\nBut (A0,A0) is better.\n\nSo the mediator needs to **solve the coordination problem**.\n\nBest solution: **design a mediator that only plays A0 when both delegate**.\n\nBut if only one delegates, it plays something that doesn\'t punish the delegator too much.\n\nBut if it plays A1 when only one delegate, then:\n- If you delegate, you play A1.\n- If the other doesn’t delegate, they play A1 → (A1,A1) → you get 3.\n\nSo you get 3.\n\nBut if both delegate, you get 5.\n\nSo you are better off if both delegate.\n\nBut if you are the only one to delegate, you get 3 (if other plays A1), which is better than 0, which you\'d get if other plays A0.\n\nSo no loss.\n\nBut the other player, if they delegate and you don\'t, they play A1, you play freely.\n\nIf you play A0 → they get 0.\nIf you play A1 → they get 3.\n\nSo they get 0 or 3 depending on you.\n\nTo avoid risk, they might not delegate.\n\nBut if you are rational and you delegate to this mediator, you end up playing A1, so if they delegate, they play A1, you play A1 → (A1,A1) → they get 3.\n\nBut if both delegate to this mediator, they get 5.\n\nSo they get 3 if they delegate but you don’t, or 5 if you do.\n\nSo they are better off if you delegate.\n\nBut again, they don\'t know.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to **avoid'

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Let's go through the reasoning step by step to decide which mediators to approve of in this decision-making game.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Review the Payoff Matrix:
- Both choose A0: you get 5, the other gets 5.
- You choose A0, the other chooses A1: you get 0, the other gets 3.
- You choose A1, the other chooses A0: you get 3, the other gets 0.
- Both choose A1: you get 3, the other gets 3.

The highest mutual payoff is achieved when both choose A0 (5, 5).

### Review the Mediators:

#### Mediator M1: Proposed by Player 1
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1.
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0.

#### Mediator M2: Proposed by Player 2
- If 1 player delegates: plays A0.
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0.

### Consider the Outcomes Based on Delegation Choices:
- If **no one** delegates:
  - Each player chooses independently. The optimal strategy might lean towards A1 to avoid a zero payoff scenario against defectors.
- If **only one player** delegates:
  - Under M1: The agent will play A1.
  - Under M2: The agent will play A0.
- If **both players** delegate:
  - Under M1: The agent will play A0.
  - Under M2: The agent will play A0.

### Strategic Implications:
- Mediator M1:
  - Suboptimal if only one player delegates since the mediating player always plays the lower payoff choice (A1), which ensures the highest payoff the other player can achieve will be 3 (if they play A1 as well).
  - Optimal if both delegate as both will get the maximum mutual payoff (5 each).
  
- Mediator M2:
  - Optimal in both cases (one or both delegating) since the player always plays A0, leading to the highest mutual payoff (5).

### Conclusion:
- **Mediator M1** is not preferred because it leaves room for suboptimal outcomes where one player receives fewer points.
- **Mediator M2** is favorable because it always leads to maximizing mutual payoffs, regardless of one or both delegating.

### Final Approval Decision:
With the conclusion that M2 is always beneficial while M1 has a risk of bad payoff distribution if only one delegates, the JSON object for the approvals is:

```json
{
  "M1": false,
  "M2": true
}
```

This decision-making process ensures that you maximize your expected total points in the game by preferring the mediator which stabilizes the strategy towards an optimal mutual outcome.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Both proposed mediators have exactly the same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates: mediator plays **A1**
- If both players delegate: mediator plays **A0**

So, whichever mediator is selected, the strategic options and outcomes available to me are identical. That means I’m indifferent between M1 and M2, and approving both cannot make me worse off (it only affects which identical mediator is chosen in case of ties).

response:
To maximize my total points in this decision-making game, I first analyze the payoff structure of the basic game:
1.  **(A0, A0):** 5 points for each.
2.  **(A0, A1):** 0 points for me, 3 points for the other player.
3.  **(A1, A0):** 3 points for me, 0 points for the other player.
4.  **(A1, A1):** 3 points for each.

Action A1 is a "safe" choice because it guarantees me 3 points regardless of the other player's action ($3$ if they play A0, $3$ if they play A1). Action A0 is "risky" because it provides 5 points if the other player also chooses A0 but 0 points if they choose A1. This is a coordination game with a payoff-dominant equilibrium (A0, A0) and a risk-dominant equilibrium (A1, A1).

Next, I evaluate the proposed mediators (M1 and M2):
- **Mediator Design (M1 and M2 are identical):**
  - If 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1 for that player.
  - If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0 for both players.

Analysis of delegation with this mediator:
- If both players delegate (D, D), the mediator plays (A0, A0), and both get **5 points**. This is the maximum possible payoff.
- If only I delegate (D, ND), the mediator plays A1 for me. Regardless of what the other player does, I get **3 points**. (The other player is then incentivized to play A1 to get 3 points instead of 0, resulting in (3, 3)).
- If only the other player delegates (ND, D), the mediator plays A1 for them. I am then incentivized to play A1 to get 3 points instead of 0, resulting in **3 points**.
- If no one delegates (ND, ND), we play the original coordination game, where we hope to reach (A0, A0) for 5 points but might end up with (A1, A1) for 3 points.

The mediator acts as a coordination mechanism that makes it safe to aim for the 5-point payoff. By delegating, I am guaranteed at least 3 points (the "safe" payoff) while creating the opportunity to reach 5 points if the other player also delegates. Since M1 and M2 are identical and provide this beneficial mechanism, I should approve both.

To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix:

*   (A0, A0): 5, 5
*   (A0, A1): 0, 3
*   (A1, A0): 3, 0
*   (A1, A1): 3, 3

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1.  **Game Dynamics**: 
    In the independent game, (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are both Nash Equilibria. However, (A0, A0) is the Pareto optimal choice, offering the highest reward (5 points each). The risk is that if one player chooses A0 and the other chooses A1, the player who chose A0 receives 0 points. Playing A1 is "safer" because it guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's move.

2.  **Mediator Analysis**: 
    The proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical. Their rules are:
    *   If 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1 for that player.
    *   If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0 for both players.

3.  **Evaluating the Mediator Outcome**:
    If a mediator (either M1 or M2) is active, how does it affect the game?
    *   **If both players delegate**: They both play A0 and receive **5 points**.
    *   **If you delegate and the other player does not**: The mediator plays A1 for you. Since A1 always results in **3 points** for you (regardless of whether the other player chooses A0 or A1), you are protected from the 0-point outcome.
    *   **If you do not delegate and the other player does**: The other player plays A1. To maximize your points in this scenario, you would also have to play A1 to receive **3 points** (receiving 0 if you play A0).

4.  **Strategic Conclusion**:
    The mediators essentially act as a coordination mechanism to reach the (A0, A0) equilibrium while providing a "safety net" (A1) if only one player agrees to cooperate. This removes the risk of receiving 0 points when aiming for the 5-point outcome. Since both M1 and M2 provide this beneficial structure and are identical in their rules, it is in your best interest to approve both.

5.  **Final Decision**:
    Approving both mediators increases the likelihood that a coordination mechanism is available, and since they both facilitate the highest potential payoff (5 points) with guaranteed safety (3 points), they are both highly favorable.

To maximize points in this game, we first analyze the payoff matrix:

*   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 3)
*   (A1, A0): (3, 0)
*   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

The game has two Nash equilibria in pure strategies: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). The (A0, A0) outcome is the payoff-dominant equilibrium (5 points each), while (A1, A1) is safer because playing A1 ensures at least 3 points regardless of the other player's move, whereas playing A0 carries a risk of receiving 0 points if the opponent plays A1.

Now, let's evaluate the proposed mediators (M1 and M2 are identical):
*   **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for that player.
*   **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both players.

If a mediator is selected, consider the "Delegate" strategy:
1.  **If both players delegate:** The mediator plays (A0, A0), and both receive **5 points**.
2.  **If you delegate and the other player plays A1 independently:** The mediator plays A1 for you. The result is (A1, A1), and you receive **3 points**.
3.  **If you delegate and the other player plays A0 independently:** The mediator plays A1 for you. The result is (A1, A0), and you receive **3 points**.
4.  **If you play A1 independently:** You are guaranteed **3 points** regardless of what the other player does.
5.  **If you play A0 independently:** You risk receiving **0 points** if the other player delegates (they'll play A1) or plays A1 independently.

The "Delegate" strategy is a weakly dominant strategy. It ensures a minimum of 3 points (the same as the safe A1 strategy) but provides a mechanism to reach the higher payoff of 5 points if the other player also chooses to coordinate via delegation. Because the mediator protects you from the 0-point outcome by defaulting to A1 if coordination isn't unanimous, it serves as an effective and safe coordination device to reach the (5, 5) outcome.

Since both M1 and M2 are identical and provide this beneficial coordination mechanism, Player 1 should approve both.

To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix:

*   **P1=A0, P2=A0**: 5 points each
*   **P1=A1, P2=A0**: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0
*   **P1=A0, P2=A1**: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3
*   **P1=A1, P2=A1**: 3 points each

This is a symmetric coordination game where (A0, A0) is the Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium (5, 5) and (A1, A1) is the risk-dominant Nash equilibrium (3, 3). Action A1 is a "safe" move, providing 3 points regardless of the opponent's choice, whereas action A0 is "risky," providing 5 points only if the other player also chooses A0, but 0 points if they choose A1.

**Mediator Analysis:**
The proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical. Their rules are:
1.  If one player delegates, the mediator plays action A1 for that player.
2.  If both players delegate, the mediator plays action A0 for both players.

**Outcomes with the Mediator:**
*   **Both delegate**: The mediator plays (A0, A0), and both receive 5 points. This is the best possible outcome.
*   **Only you delegate**: The mediator plays A1 for you. Whether the other player chooses A0 or A1, you are guaranteed 3 points (and the other player gets either 0 or 3).
*   **Neither delegates**: You are back in the original game, where you must coordinate manually to reach (5, 5), otherwise you might end up with the safer (3, 3).

**Conclusion:**
Delegating to this mediator is a superior strategy. It provides a foolproof way to reach the (5, 5) payoff if both players cooperate with the mediator, while offering the safety of action A1 (guaranteeing 3 points) if the other player does not delegate. Since both M1 and M2 offer this protection and opportunity for the highest payoff, approving both is the optimal decision.

response:
To maximize the total points received in this game, let's analyze the payoff matrix and the role of the proposed mediators:

### 1. Game Analysis
The payoff matrix is as follows (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, action **A1** is a "safe" strategy for both players. If Player 1 chooses A1, they are guaranteed 3 points regardless of what Player 2 does. Conversely, action **A0** offers the highest potential payoff (5 points) but carries the risk of receiving 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

### 2. Mediator Analysis
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both players.

### 3. Impact of the Mediator
The mediator acts as a coordination mechanism that safeguards players:
- **Mutual Delegation:** If both players delegate, the mediator plays (A0, A0), and both players receive 5 points. This is the optimal outcome.
- **Single Delegation:** If you delegate and the other player does not, the mediator plays A1 for you. Since A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of the opponent's move, you are protected from the 0-point outcome. 
- **No Delegation:** If neither player delegates, they must coordinate manually. While they could still reach (A0, A0), they lack the contractual "safety net" the mediator provides.

Because the mediator effectively turns a coordination problem into a safer choice—allowing players to attempt (5, 5) while ensuring they receive at least 3 points if the other player doesn't coordinate—it is highly beneficial for both players.

### 4. Decision
Both M1 and M2 are identical in their rules and beneficial for reaching the Pareto-optimal outcome of (5, 5). Approving both mediators increases the likelihood that a beneficial mediator will be available in the game.

  "M1": true,

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the optimal strategy.

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

First, let's reiterate the payoff matrix based on the actions of both players:

|            | Player 1: A0  | Player 1: A1  |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Player 2: A0 | (5, 5)        | (0, 3)        |
| Player 2: A1 | (3, 0)        | (3, 3)        |

### Step 2: Consider the Impact of the Mediator

The mediator's actions are:
- If 1 player delegates, the mediator chooses A1.
- If 2 players delegate, the mediator chooses A0.

### Step 3: Determine the Payoffs if Using the Mediator

Now, let's investigate the scenarios where delegation happens:
- If **only Player 2** delegates:
  - Mediator plays A1 for Player 2.
  - Player 1:
    - Plays A0: Player 2 gets 3 points
    - Plays A1: Player 2 gets 3 points
  - In both cases, Player 2 gets 3 points.

- If **both players** delegate:
  - Mediator plays A0 for both.
  - Both get 5 points each.

Player 2 needs to think about the implications based on the strategies of Player 1:
- If Player 2 acts independently, they need to consider the reaction of Player 1's mixed strategy.
- If Player 2 chooses to delegate, it simplifies to considering how likely Player 1 will also delegate.

### Step 4: Formulate the Strategy

Given the payoffs and potential outcomes, Player 2 should consider a balance between independent actions and delegation to maximize points over multiple rounds. Typically, it might be rational to assume that cooperation (both delegating) can often offer better consistency in payoff. However, playing independently might be beneficial if there's a high probability of Player 1 favoring A0, giving higher payoff when Player 2 selects A0.

Given Player 1 proposed the mediator, it might imply a willingness to cooperate. Thus, Player 2 might consider a higher delegation probability. However, as a mixed strategy also accounts for uncertainties and competitive play, retaining some independent choices is prudent.

### Step 5: Compute the Mixed Strategy

Assuming it is optimal to balance some risk with cooperation, the mixed strategy might look something like:
- A certain probability on delegation to encourage mutual cooperation.
- A mix of A0 and A1 to maintain flexibility and response potential if Player 1 does not delegate.

### Decision:
Given the cooperative scenario and assumption of rational behavior favoring cooperation:

- Delegate (A2) should have a higher probability but not 100% to maintain tactical balance.
- A0 and A1 should be weighted, considering A0 is typically more rewarding if mutual non-delegation happens.

A reasonable assumption might be:
- Delegate: 50%
- Independent A0: 30%
- Independent A1: 20%

### Final Answer
```json
{"A0": 30, "A1": 20, "A2": 50}
```

This probability distribution aims to balance independent benefits, strategic delegation, and maintaining a potential for mutual high payoffs through mediated cooperation.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are Player 2 in a symmetric two-player game with choices:

- Actions: A0, A1  
- Payoffs (as Player 2):

| Your Move | Other Player's Move | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0       | A0                   | 5           | 5                      |
| A0       | A1                   | 0           | 3                      |
| A1       | A0                   | 3           | 0                      |
| A1       | A1                   | 3           | 3                      |

This is a **coordination game** with a **prisoner's dilemma-like flavor**. Let's analyze:

- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0: you get 5 (best)
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1: you get 3
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1: you get 0 (bad)
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0: you get 3 (better than 0)

Note: The only way to get the highest payoff (5) is to **both play A0**.

But there's an incentive to deviate:
- If you think opponent will play A0, you prefer A0 (5) over A1 (3), so A0 is better.
- If you think opponent will play A1, you prefer A1 (3) over A0 (0), so A1 is better.

So **A0 is a best response to A0**, **A1 is a best response to A1**.

This game has **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).  
Also, there’s a mixed strategy equilibrium.

But importantly, if coordination fails, you end up with 0 or worse.

Now, **you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator**.

---

### **Step 2: Mediator Delegation Mechanism**

- You can either **act independently** or **delegate** your action to a **mediator**.
- The mediator is selected by **approval voting** among proposed mediators.
- The **winner** is chosen uniformly at random from those with **max approvals**.
- If you delegate, the mediator plays **based on how many players delegate** to it.

Two mediators are proposed:
- **M1**: Proposed by Player 1
- **M2**: Proposed by Player 2

But wait: **M1 and M2 have identical behavior**:

> - If 1 player delegates to the mediator → it plays **A1**
> - If 2 players delegate to the mediator → it plays **A0**

So, regardless of who proposed it, both M1 and M2 behave **identically**:
- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

So **any difference in approval depends on your own strategic interest in **favoring one versus the other**.

But wait — do they really behave identically?

Yes — same rule set.
So we can treat them as functionally the same.

But here’s a twist: **you are Player 2**, and **M2 is proposed by Player 2**.

But the design is the same. So why would you care?

Let’s consider: Could there be a **strategic reason to approve only one**?

Possibility: **Incentives to coordinate**. Suppose you want to *ensure* that the median is selected, and you want a certain outcome.

But remember: **The winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from the one(s) with the most approvals**.

So if you approve M1 and not M2, and M2 gets no approvals, then M1 wins **only if** it gets more approvals than others.

But if M1 and M2 are identical, **your approval of one or the other doesn't change the outcome** — it only changes the **set of potential winners**.

But if both are identical in behavior, then **the actual game outcome depends only on which mediator is selected**, not which one it is.

So **you are indifferent between M1 and M2 in terms of payoff**.

Then why would you disapprove one?

Only if:
- You believe that **if it’s M2**, it might affect **other players' reasoning** in a way that changes their behavior.
- But this is a **decision between approval of mediators**, not matching or signaling.

Wait — **the other player is also involved in the approval process**.

So the **approval votes are private**, but you are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**.

You must consider: **How will the other player vote?**

But wait — do you know the other player’s preferences?

Not explicitly. But you know their incentives.

Let’s clarify: You are Player 2.

The other player is Player 1.

Mediator M1 was proposed by Player 1.

Mediator M2 was proposed by Player 2 (i.e., you).

Now, **the winning mediator is the one with the maximum approvals** — chosen uniformly at random if tied.

Your goal: to **maximize your expected points**.

So you must decide: **Which mediators to approve?**

Now, since the two mediators behave identically, approving M1 vs M2 doesn’t change the **behavior of the mediator** if it wins.

So **payoff only depends on which mediator wins**, not which one.

But since they behave the same, **the payoff is identical regardless of which one wins, if we assume the delegation numbers are the same**.

So the only difference is **strategic timing** of approval.

But here’s a key point: **You cannot predict what the other player will do**.

But you can **reason about incentives**.

Let’s suppose that:

- If **you approve both**, then both are eligible.
- If **you approve only M2**, then only M2 can win (assuming others don’t approve M1).
- If **you approve only M1**, then M1 can win, M2 cannot.

Now, consider: The **other player (Player 1)** is the proposer of M1.

So likely, Player 1 will **approve M1** and may **disapprove M2** (since it’s your proposal).

But we don’t know.

But Player 1 *may* be inclined to favor M1, to increase its chance of winning.

Player 2 (you) is the proposer of M2, so you may support it.

But you can choose your own approval list.

Now, consider the **possible outcomes**, depending on delegation and mediator choice.

#### **Strategy 1: You approve both M1 and M2**

Then both are in the running.

If the other player approves only M1, then M1 has more approvals → M1 wins.

If other player approves only M2, then M2 wins.

If other player approves both, then both tied → winner chosen at random.

But since M1 and M2 behave the same, **the outcome of the game depends only on how many players end up delegating to the chosen mediator**, not which one it is.

So in **all cases**, the mediator acts as:
- If 1 player delegates → A1
- If 2 players delegate → A0

Now, **your choice of whether to delegate or not affects the number of delegates**.

But remember: You are deciding now — **who you approve**, **before** delegation.

You are not yet deciding whether to delegate.

But your decision must account for **how your approval affects the likelihood of favorable outcomes**.

But here’s a key point: **You are trying to maximize your expected payoff**, and you are free to choose from the set of mediators.

Now, let’s ask: **Can you achieve better outcomes by influencing which mediator is selected?**

Only if the mediator behavior depends on identity — but here, M1 and M2 behave identically.

So **no**.

Thus, your **approval choice doesn’t affect the outcome** of the game **except** by possibly restricting the set of available mediators.

But since the behavior is identical, **there is no difference**.

However, now consider **incentives for the other player**.

Suppose:
- You **do not approve M2**.
- Then M2 cannot win.
- So only M1 can win (if it gets maximum approvals).

Similarly, if you don’t approve M1, M1 cannot win.

Now, suppose you **approve both** — you allow **either** mediator to win.

But since both behave identically, it doesn’t matter.

But now, suppose **the other player (Player 1)** is **strategic**.

Player 1 wants a **high chance** that **M1** wins, because it's their proposal.

Likely, Player 1 will approve M1 (probably also M2? — not necessarily).

But — here’s a twist: **Maybe Player 1 wants to maximize their own payoff, so they care about the actual outcome**.

Let’s think: What is the **best outcome** for you?

You are Player 2.

You want to maximize your points.

Now, you have two main options:
1. Act independently (choose a probability distribution over A0/A1).
2. Delegate to a mediator.

But **you have not yet decided whether to delegate** — that decision comes later.

But **your approval choice affects which mediators are available**.

Now, suppose you **only approve M1**.

Then, M2 cannot be selected → only M1 can win.

But M1 behaves the same as M2.

So if M1 is selected, the behavior is:
- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

Same as if M2 is selected.

So no difference.

But now, **what if you try to force M1 to be selected?**

If you approve only M1, and the other player approves both, then both are eligible — M1 may still win.

But if you **approve only M1**, and the other player approves only M2, then M2 wins.

But if you **approve both**, then both are eligible regardless.

But again, since behavior is same, **it doesn't matter**.

But wait — is there a **mechanism vulnerability**?

What if the **mediator's action depends on who proposed it**?

No — the description says:
> Mediator proposed by Player 1: ... [behavior]
> Mediator proposed by Player 2: ... [same behavior]

So **the behavior is identical**.

Therefore, from a **game-theoretic perspective**, the outcome depends only on:
- How many players delegate
- Which mediator is selected (but since behavior is same, irrelevant)

Thus, your approval decision **does not affect the payoff**, as long as the **set of possible mediators is the same**.

But now consider **what happens when you approve only one**.

Suppose you **disapprove M2**.

Then M2 cannot win.

Now, suppose the other player also disapproves M1 (e.g., if they don’t like it).

Then **no mediator wins**? But the game says: **the winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if **no one approves any mediator**, then **no mediator can be selected** → you cannot delegate?

But the rules say: "you will have the option to delegate", but it’s **after** the approval process.

So **if no mediator is selected**, then **delegation is not allowed**, or you must act independently.

But more importantly, **you can still act independently**, even if no mediator wins.

So delegation is **available only if a mediator is approved and selected**.

So if you disapprove both M1 and M2, then **no mediator can be selected** → delegation option is **not available**.

But in this case, **you must play independently**.

Alternatively, if **only one mediator is approved**, then **it wins**, and you can delegate.

So the **only way to delegate is if at least one mediator is approved by someone**.

Now, back to your decision.

You are **Player 2 (proposer of M2)**.

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Let’s compare:

### **Option A: Approve both M1 and M2**

- Then both are eligible.
- If at least one person approves one of them, a mediator can win.
- You can later choose to delegate or not.
- Since both mediators behave identically, **no difference in outcome**.

### **Option B: Approve only M2**

- Then M1 cannot win.
- If the other player approves M1, then M1 is the only one approved → M1 wins.
- If the other player approves M2, then M2 wins.
- If the other player approves both, then both eligible → winner chosen at random → M1 or M2 → same behavior.

So regardless, a mediator can win.

But if **you approve only M2**, and the other player approves only M1, then M1 wins.

But **you still can delegate** (if you choose to), and the mediator (M1) behaves as per rules: 1 delegate → A1, 2 → A0.

Same as if M2 were used.

So again, **payoff is unaffected**.

### **Option C: Approve only M1**

Then M2 cannot win.

Other player may approve M2 → then M2 could win only if you approved it.

But if you don’t approve M2, and other player does, then M2 is not eligible.

So if you approve only M1, and other player approves M2 only, then M2 has one approval, M1 has one → tie → random selection → 50% chance M1 or M2.

But again, same behavior — so outcome same.

### **Conclusion so far: Since M1 and M2 behave identically, the game outcome depends only on:**
- How many players delegate (1 or 2)
- Which behavior results (A1 if 1 delegate, A0 if 2)

So **which mediator wins does not matter**.

Your approval choice only affects:
- Whether a mediator is available
- The set of possible mediators

But since **they behave the same**, you’re indifferent.

BUT — there is a **strategic concern**:

- You are proposing M2.
- You want M2 to be selected, or at least, **not excluded inadvertently**.

But since M2 behaves the same as M1, **you gain nothing from it winning**, unless the **other player** values it more — but you don’t care about the other player's payoff.

Your goal: **maximize your own expected payoff**.

So **if both mediators are identical**, then it doesn't matter which one wins.

So **you should approve both**, to **increase the chance that a mediator is selected**.

Because if you disapprove one, you risk **blocking a mediator**.

Suppose:
- You disapprove M2.
- The other player disapproves M1.
- Then **no mediator can be selected**.
- Then **delegation is not available**.
- So you must play independently.

But if you **approve both**, then **even if other player approves neither**, you have at least one approval → then that mediator wins → you **can delegate**.

So by approving both, you increase the **chance that a mediator is available**, and thus **increases your chance to delegate**.

Why would you want to delegate? Because delegation may **lead to better coordination**.

Let’s analyze the **value of delegation**.

Suppose **you delegate**, and the mediator is selected.

Then the mediator will play:
- A1 if **1 player** delegates
- A0 if **2 players** delegate

But: **You decide whether to delegate**, but you do so **after** the mediator is chosen.

But both players are making the **delegation decision simultaneously**, I assume.

Let’s read again:

> You and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game.

> Then, after that, you each choose your action — either independently or via delegation.

So the sequence is:

1. Both players approve or disapprove mediators.
2. The winning mediator is selected (from approved ones with max approvals).
3. Now, **each player chooses**:
   - Act independently (choose A0 or A1 with some probability)
   - Or delegate to the mediator → the mediator plays based on **how many delegates there are**

So: after mediator is selected, you decide whether to delegate.

Now, **you care about whether to delegate**.

But **you want to maximize your points**.

Now, suppose a mediator is available.

If **you delegate**, then your action is determined by:
- Number of delegates to the mediator → either 1 or 2

So **if you delegate, and the other player also delegates**, then number of delegates = 2 → mediator plays A0.

If only you delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1.

Similarly, if you don’t delegate, and they do → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1.

If neither delegates → **the mediator is not used** → but you can still act independently.

But **the mediator is only used if at least one player delegates**.

Wait — actually, the mediator is **only invoked if you delegate**.

So:

- If neither delegates → both act independently → base game.
- If one delegates → mediator plays A1 (1 delegate)
- If both delegate → mediator plays A0 (2 delegates)

So negotiation is about whether you want to **induce A0 or A1**.

But **your actions depend on other’s choices**.

Now, let’s suppose **you are sure that the mediator is available**.

Then, **if you delegate**, you depend on:
- Whether the other player delegates → determines mediator action.

But you can’t know their choice.

BUT: you can **choose to delegate or not**, knowing that if both delegate → mediator plays A0.

Could you **use delegation to coordinate on A0**?

Yes!

Suppose both players **prefer (A0, A0)** → 5 each.

But in the base game, without coordination, it’s hard.

But if you **both delegate**, then:
- Two delegates → mediator plays A0
- So both get A0
- So you both get 5

Perfect coordination!

Alternatively, if only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → that player gets A1, the other gets whatever they play.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can play independently.

But delegation lets you **coordinate** successfully on A0.

So **delegating has value if both players do it**, because it *forces* both to play A0 → 5 points each.

But if only one delegates, the mediator plays A1.

Then:
- The delegating player gets A1 (if the other plays A0, they get 3; if other plays A1, they get 3)
- But the non-delegator can choose.

So it’s tricky.

But let’s ask: **what is the best outcome?**

- (A0, A0): 5 each → best
- (A1, A1): 3 each
- (A0, A1): 0 and 3
- (A1, A0): 3 and 0

So **A0, A0 is best**.

Can delegation help achieve that?

Yes — **if both players delegate**, then mediator plays A0 → both get A0 → 5 each.

Perfect.

Now, is there a **risk**? Only if **only one** delegates → then mediator plays A1 → the delegate gets A1, but the other gets whatever they play.

But if the other player is rational and wants to avoid 0, they might also delegate.

So this suggests a **potential for coordination**.

But to **make this work**, you need **both to delegate**.

And to **avoid belated coordination**, you need to be **confident** that the other player is willing to delegate.

But now: **you need the mediator to be available**.

So if **you disapprove both mediators**, then **no mediator is selected** → delegation not possible → you must play independently → no coordination → likely to fail to coordinate on A0.

So you **lose the chance to get 5**.

Similarly, if you **only approve M1**, and the other player **only approves M2**, then both mediators have one approval → tie → winner chosen at random → **either one can win**, but behavior same.

So still, waiting.

But **if one of the mediators is not approved by you or the other**, but the other **approves one**, it’s fine.

But maximum risk is: **if you disapprove a mediator, and the other does too, then no mediator exists**.

So **to maximize the chance that a mediator is available**, you should **approve both**.

Because:
- If you disapprove M1, and the other player disapproves M1, then M1 is not available.
- If you disapprove M2, same for M2.

But if you approve **both**, then **even if the other player approves neither**, you still have **one approval** → so **at least one mediator is approved** → so a mediator can be selected (the one with highest approval) → you can delegate.

Thus, by approving **both**, you **ensure** that a mediator is available **unless the other player disapproves both**.

But since you are indifferent between M1 and M2 in terms of behavior, and you want to **maximize the chance of delegation**, you should approve both.

In fact, **approving only one** risks **blocking eligibility**.

For example, suppose you approve only M1.

Then M2 cannot be selected.

Now, if the other player approves only M2, then:
- M1 has 1 approval (yours)
- M2 has 1 approval (theirs)
→ tie → random selection → 50% chance M1 wins, 50% M2
→ but in either case, mediator is selected → you can delegate.

No risk.

But suppose the other player approves **neither**.

Then:
- M1 has 1 approve (yours)
- M2 has 0
→ M1 wins → mediator available.

So still okay.

Only **if you disapprove both**, and other player approves neither → then no mediator → no delegation.

But if you approve **only one**, and other approves **none**, then that one still wins → mediation available.

So actually, **as long as you approve at least one**, and the other player approves at least one **or not**, then at least one mediator has approval → so a mediator wins.

Only **if you approve no one**, and other approves no one → then no mediator.

So **by approving at least one**, you ensure that **if the other player approves at least one**, then a mediator wins.

But **if the other player approves no one**, then your approval is enough to make a mediator win.

So **you only need to approve one** to make delegation possible.

But then why approve both?

**Because: You are Player 2, and M2 is your proposal.**

But since behavior is identical, **it doesn't matter**.

But **if you approve only M2**, and the other player **disapproves both**, then M2 wins (only approval) → you can delegate.

Same as if you approve M1.

But **if you approve both**, and the other player approves only M1, then M1 wins.

Still the same.

So the **only benefit of approving both is**:

- **Ensuring that if the other player approves only one**, and it’s a different one, it can still be selected.

But no advantage.

But suppose **the other player is strategic and knows you want M2**.

But you don’t know.

But your goal is **maximize your expected payoff**.

Now, since you **can delegate**, and delegation is valuable (can coordinate on A0), you want to **maximize the chance that a mediator is available**.

But as shown, **approving just one mediator is enough** to make it available (if no one else approves, you win; if others approve, still eligible).

So **approving one is sufficient**.

But now, suppose you **disapprove both**.

Then:
- If other player approves only M1 → M1 wins → mediation available.
- If other player approves only M2 → M2 wins.
- If other player approves neither → **no mediator** → cannot delegate.

So to maximize the chance that a mediator is available, you should approve **at least one**.

But **approving both is not necessary**.

However, **you are free to approve both**.

But **why would you disapprove one**?

Only if you **think that approving both reduces your chance of getting a good outcome**.

But here’s a deep point:

Suppose you approve **only M2**.

Then M1 cannot be selected.

But M2 can.

But M1 and M2 behave the same.

So no difference.

But now, suppose **the other player disapproves M2**.

Then only M1 can win (if it gets approval).

But you don’t care.

The key insight:

- The **only way delegation fails** is if **no mediator is approved by anyone**.
- So **to prevent that**, you should approve at least one.
- Approving both is **not harmful**, and doesn’t hurt your payoff.
- But approving only one is **sufficient**.

But in **this case, since both mediators are identical**, and you get no benefit from M2 being selected, and M1 being selected is the same, you might as well **approve both** to increase the chances of selection if there's a tie.

But it doesn’t matter.

But here’s a **crucial observation**: **mediators are identical in behavior**, so **your approval does not affect the game outcome** — only whether a mediator is available.

And **either mediator (M1 or M2) being selected** will lead to **identical behavior**.

Therefore, **you should approve both to increase the likelihood that at least one mediator is available**.

Because:
- If you approve only M1, and the other player approves only M2, then both have one approval → tie → random → one wins.
- If you approve both, and other player approves only M2, then M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → still tie → random → same.
- But if you **disapprove M1**, and other player approves only M2, then M2 has 1, M1 has 0 → M2 wins → still okay.
- So **no danger in disapproving one**.

But **the worst case** for you (if you disapprove both) is that **no mediator wins**.

So to **avoid that**, you must approve at least one.

But you are **Player 2**, and M2 is **your proposal**.

You might **want to support your own proposal**, but it doesn’t help.

But **there is no cost** to approving both.

And **no benefit to disapproving one**.

So **why not approve both**?

Yes — because it **does not harm you**, and **ensures that a mediator is available even if the other player approves only one**, and it **doesn’t prevent M2 from being selected**.

But more importantly, **since M1 and M2 are identical**, there is **no strategic difference**.

So **you should approve both**.

Unless you believe that **other player prefers one over the other**, but you don’t know.

But since behavior is identical, you should **approve both**.

Moreover, **if you disapprove one**, you **reduce the set of possible mediators**, which **never helps**.

So **optimal is to approve both**.

Final decision:

- M1: approve → true
- M2: approve → true

Because:
- They behave the same.
- You want to maximize the chance that a mediator is available.
- Approving both doesn't hurt and helps in some cases (e.g., if other player approves one, and you approve both, still eligible).
- But even if you approve only one, it’s okay.
- But to be safe and conservative, approve both.

Wait — actually, **approving both is equivalent in risk to approving one**, as long as you approve at least one.

But there is **no downside** to approving both.

So **approving both is safe and optimal**.

Final answer:

response:
To maximize points in this game, we analyze the payoff matrix for the three actions: A0, A1, and A2 (Delegate).

**Step 1: Determine Action Outcomes**
- A0 vs. A0: (5, 5)
- A0 vs. A1: (0, 3)
- A0 vs. A2: (A0 vs. Mediator-A1) = (0, 3)
- A1 vs. A0: (3, 0)
- A1 vs. A1: (3, 3)
- A1 vs. A2: (A1 vs. Mediator-A1) = (3, 3)
- A2 vs. A0: (Mediator-A1 vs. A0) = (3, 0)
- A2 vs. A1: (Mediator-A1 vs. A1) = (3, 3)
- A2 vs. A2: (Mediator-A0 vs. Mediator-A0) = (5, 5)

**Step 2: Payoff Matrix Summary (Player 1, Player 2)**
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 | P2: A2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) | (3, 3) |
| **P1: A2** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) | (5, 5) |

**Step 3: Strategic Analysis**
- **Dominance:** For both players, action A2 weakly dominates action A1. A2 provides the same payoffs as A1 if the opponent plays A0 or A1, but provides a higher payoff (5 vs. 3) if the opponent plays A2. Therefore, A1 is not an optimal choice.
- **Risk Comparison:** 
  - If you choose **A0**, your payoff is either 5 (if P2 chooses A0) or 0 (if P2 chooses A1 or A2).
  - If you choose **A2**, your payoff is either 3 (if P2 chooses A0 or A1) or 5 (if P2 chooses A2).
- **Nash Equilibria:** The pure strategy Nash Equilibria are (A0, A0) and (A2, A2). Both yield (5, 5).
- **Safety Strategy:** Choosing A2 is much safer than A0. A2 guarantees a minimum of 3 points (the "maximin" value), whereas A0 has a minimum of 0 points. Given that P2 is likely to reach the same conclusion regarding the safety and dominance of A2, the coordination outcome (A2, A2) is the most robust equilibrium.

**Step 4: Conclusion**
Since A2 is both a part of a Pareto-optimal Nash Equilibrium and the safest action to take (guaranteeing 3 points even if coordination fails), delegating to the mediator is the most rational choice.

response:
To maximize the points received in this game, let’s analyze the payoff matrix and the effects of the mediator.

### 1. Game Analysis
First, we analyze the standard actions (A0 and A1) and the delegation action (A2):
- **Payoffs for standard actions:**
  - (A0, A0): (5, 5)
  - (A0, A1): (0, 3)
  - (A1, A0): (3, 0)
  - (A1, A1): (3, 3)

- **Payoffs with delegation (A2):**
  - If **only Player 1 delegates (A2, A0 or A2, A1)**: The mediator plays A1 for Player 1.
    - (A2, A0) results in (A1, A0) → (3, 0).
    - (A2, A1) results in (A1, A1) → (3, 3).
  - If **only Player 2 delegates (A0, A2 or A1, A2)**: The mediator plays A1 for Player 2.
    - (A0, A2) results in (A0, A1) → (0, 3).
    - (A1, A2) results in (A1, A1) → (3, 3).
  - If **both delegate (A2, A2)**: The mediator plays A0 for both.
    - (A2, A2) results in (A0, A0) → (5, 5).

### 2. The Payoff Matrix
Here is the combined payoff matrix:
| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A0** | 5, 5 | 0, 3 | 0, 3 |
| **A1** | 3, 0 | 3, 3 | 3, 3 |
| **A2** | 3, 0 | 3, 3 | 5, 5 |

### 3. Strategy Evaluation
- **Dominance:** Action A2 strictly dominates action A1 if there is any probability that the other player will choose A2. In all other scenarios (A0 or A1), A2 and A1 yield the same results. Therefore, A1 is effectively obsolete.
- **Coordination:** There are two primary Nash Equilibria that yield the maximum payoff of 5: **(A0, A0)** and **(A2, A2)**.
- **Risk Comparison:** 
  - If you play **A0** and the other player deviates (playing A1 or A2), you receive **0**.
  - If you play **A2** and the other player deviates (playing A0 or A1), you receive **3**.
  
A2 is significantly safer than A0 because it guarantees a minimum of 3 points regardless of the opponent's move, while still offering the maximum potential of 5 points.

### 4. Conclusion
The existence of the mediator (proposed by Player 1 and approved by both) creates a focal point for coordination. Given the safety and potential for maximum points, delegating to the mediator is the most rational strategy.

response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we evaluate the payoffs for each possible action combination, including the newly introduced delegation option (A2).

### Evaluation of Payoffs

The payoff matrix for Player 1 (you) and Player 2 based on their actions (A0, A1, A2) is as follows:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (Ind.) | A1 (Ind.) | A2 (Mediator) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A0 (Ind.)** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) | (0, 3) |
| **A1 (Ind.)** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) | (3, 3) |
| **A2 (Delegate)** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) | (5, 5) |

**Analysis of Actions:**
1.  **A1 (Independent):** This action is weakly dominated by **A2**. Against A0 and A1, both A1 and A2 yield a payoff of 3. However, against A2, action A1 yields 3 points while A2 yields 5 points.
2.  **A0 (Independent):** This action yields the maximum payoff (5) if the opponent plays A0. However, if the opponent plays A1 or A2, the payoff drops to 0.
3.  **A2 (Delegate):** This action yields the maximum payoff (5) if the opponent also delegates (A2). If the opponent plays A0 or A1, the mediator plays A1 for you, yielding a guaranteed 3 points.

### Strategic Reasoning
This scenario is a coordination game with two potential equilibria that maximize mutual benefit (5, 5): (A0, A0) and (A2, A2).

*   **Risk Dominance:** In coordination games, players often look for the "risk-dominant" equilibrium—the one which is safer if the other player deviates.
    *   If you choose **A0** and the other player deviates (or plays A1/A2), you receive **0 points**.
    *   If you choose **A2** and the other player deviates (or plays A0/A1), you receive **3 points**.
*   **Safety:** A2 is a strictly safer strategy than A0 because its minimum payoff is 3, whereas A0's minimum payoff is 0. Since A2 also offers the potential for the maximum payoff of 5 (if the other player also chooses A2), it is the most robust choice.

Given that both players want to maximize their points and understand the risks, A2 is the rational choice as it provides safety (3 points guaranteed) while still allowing for the cooperative maximum (5 points) if both players delegate.

response:
To decide which mediators to approve, we need to analyze the impact of each mediator on our payoff in the game. Let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand Current Payoff Matrix and Best Responses:**
   - If both players play A0, both get 5 points.
   - If you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0 points, and they get 3 points.
   - If you play A1 and the other plays A0, you get 3 points, and they get 0 points.
   - If both play A1, both get 3 points.

   Best response without any mediator:
   - Mutual cooperation (both A0) is the most beneficial with a payoff of 5 points each, which is better than both playing A1 (3 points each).

2. **Mediator Analysis:**
   - **Mediator proposed by Player 1 ("M1"):**
     - If 1 player delegates, the mediator plays A1.
     - If 2 players delegate, the mediator plays A0.

     For "M1":
     - If only you delegate, you would play A1 when the other player might play A0 or A1. Potential payoffs:
       - You (A1), Other (A0): You get 3 points.
       - You (A1), Other (A1): You get 3 points.
     - If both delegate, both play A0, each getting 5 points.

     This mediator encourages mutual delegation to achieve the highest payoff (5 points each).

   - **Mediator proposed by Player 2 ("M2"):**
     - If 1 player delegates, the mediator plays A0.
     - If 2 players delegate, the mediator plays A0.

     For "M2":
     - Regardless of delegation count, mediator always plays A0, ensuring maximum payoff (5 points each if both delegate).

### Summary:
- **Mediator M1** ensures mutual cooperation (both A0) if both delegate, otherwise plays A1, which is less beneficial if only one player delegates.
- **Mediator M2** always ensures mutual cooperation (A0) regardless of delegation count.

### Approval Decision:
Given that M2 always ensures mutual cooperation, which maximizes our payoff, hence it should be approved. M1 is also beneficial since if both delegate, it ensures the maximum payoff. Therefore, we should approve both M1 and M2 for flexibility.

### Final Answer:
```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}

The mediator's rules for action A2 are:
- If only one player delegates (A2), they play action A1.
- If both players delegate (A2), they play action A0.

Expanding the payoff matrix to include A2 for both players:
- (A0, A2): Mediator plays A1 for Player 2, results in (A0, A1) -> (0, 3)
- (A1, A2): Mediator plays A1 for Player 2, results in (A1, A1) -> (3, 3)
- (A2, A0): Mediator plays A1 for Player 1, results in (A1, A0) -> (3, 0)
- (A2, A1): Mediator plays A1 for Player 1, results in (A1, A1) -> (3, 3)
- (A2, A2): Mediator plays A0 for both, results in (A0, A0) -> (5, 5)

Comparing Player 1's strategies:
- **A1**: (3, 3, 3) across P2's actions (A0, A1, A2)
- **A2**: (3, 3, 5) across P2's actions (A0, A1, A2)
Action A2 weakly dominates A1. A2 is always at least as good as A1 and is strictly better if Player 2 also delegates.

Comparing A0 and A2:
- If Player 2 plays A0: A0 gives 5, A2 gives 3.
- If Player 2 plays A1: A0 gives 0, A2 gives 3.
- If Player 2 plays A2: A0 gives 0, A2 gives 5.

Both (A0, A0) and (A2, A2) are Nash equilibria, each resulting in (5, 5). However, A2 is significantly more robust. If Player 1 plays A2, they are guaranteed at least 3 points regardless of what Player 2 does (A0, A1, or A2). If Player 1 plays A0, they risk getting 0 points if Player 2 plays A1 or A2. Since P2 faces the same incentives, it is most rational for both players to choose the coordinate at (A2, A2).

response:
To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the game by constructing the payoff matrix for the actions $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_2$ (Delegate).

### 1. Payoff Matrix Analysis
The original rewards for $(Player 1, Player 2)$ are:
- $(A_0, A_0) = (5, 5)$
- $(A_0, A_1) = (0, 3)$
- $(A_1, A_0) = (3, 0)$
- $(A_1, A_1) = (3, 3)$

Now we incorporate the mediator ($A_2$):
- If only Player 2 delegates ($A_2$), the mediator plays $A_1$ for them.
- If only Player 1 delegates ($A_2$), the mediator plays $A_1$ for them.
- If both delegate ($A_2, A_2$), the mediator plays $A_0$ for both.

**Player 2's payoffs:**
- If Player 1 plays $A_0$:
  - $A_0 \implies 5$
  - $A_1 \implies 3$
  - $A_2 \implies 3$ (Mediator plays $A_1$ for $P_2$)
- If Player 1 plays $A_1$:
  - $A_0 \implies 0$
  - $A_1 \implies 3$
  - $A_2 \implies 3$ (Mediator plays $A_1$ for $P_2$)
- If Player 1 plays $A_2$:
  - $A_0 \implies 0$ (Mediator plays $A_1$ for $P_1$)
  - $A_1 \implies 3$ (Mediator plays $A_1$ for $P_1$)
  - $A_2 \implies 5$ (Mediator plays $A_0$ for both)

**Combined Payoff Matrix $(P_1, P_2)$:**
| P1 \ P2 | $A_0$ | $A_1$ | $A_2$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **$A_0$** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) | (0, 3) |
| **$A_1$** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) | (3, 3) |
| **$A_2$** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) | (5, 5) |

### 2. Strategic Evaluation
- **Dominance:** For Player 2, action $A_2$ weakly dominates $A_1$ because the payoffs for $A_2$ $(3, 3, 5)$ are greater than or equal to the payoffs for $A_1$ $(3, 3, 3)$. Therefore, $A_1$ should be avoided ($0\%$).
- **Equilibria:** There are two primary Nash equilibria: $(A_0, A_0)$ and $(A_2, A_2)$, both yielding $(5, 5)$.
- **Risk Dominance:** In coordination games, we look at which equilibrium is safer. 
  - If you play $A_0$ and the other player doesn't, you get $0$.
  - If you play $A_2$ and the other player doesn't, you get at least $3$.
  
To prefer $A_0$, you must be at least $71\%$ certain the other player will also choose $A_0$. To prefer $A_2$, you only need a $29\%$ certainty that the other player will choose $A_2$. Given that the mediator was specifically proposed to facilitate cooperation, $A_2$ is the most robust and rational choice for both players.

### 3. Conclusion
Action $A_2$ provides the same maximum payoff as $A_0$ with significantly less risk and weakly dominates $A_1$. Thus, the rational choice is to delegate entirely to the mediator.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the Base Game

The payoff matrix for me (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

The Nash equilibrium of the base game is (A0, A0) giving both players 5 points.

## Step 2: Analyze M1 (Player 1's Mediator)

M1 plays A1 if 1 player delegates, A0 if 2 players delegate.

Delegation game outcomes under M1:
- **Both delegate**: M1 plays A0 for both → (5, 5) ✓
- **Only I delegate**: M1 plays A1 for me. P1's best response to my A1 is A1 → (3, 3)
- **Only P1 delegates**: M1 plays A1 for P1. My best response to P1's A1 is A1 → (3, 3)
- **Neither delegates**: Base game Nash → (5, 5) ✓

M1 creates a **coordination problem**: We need to both delegate or both not delegate to get (5, 5). Any mismatch leads to (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze M2 (My Mediator)

M2 plays A0 regardless of delegation count.

Delegation game outcomes under M2:
- **Both delegate**: M2 plays A0 for both → (5, 5) ✓
- **Only I delegate**: M2 plays A0 for me. P1's best response to my A0 is A0 → (5, 5) ✓
- **Only P1 delegates**: M2 plays A0 for P1. My best response to P1's A0 is A0 → (5, 5) ✓
- **Neither delegates**: Base game Nash → (5, 5) ✓

M2 **guarantees (5, 5) regardless of delegation choices** - completely robust!

## Step 4: Compare Mediators

- **M1**: Achieves (5, 5) only with coordination; risks (3, 3) with miscoordination
- **M2**: Guarantees (5, 5) in all cases

M2 is strictly better (more robust) than M1 for both players.

## Step 5: Strategic Voting

If I approve only M2:
- If P1 approves only M1: 50-50 random selection
- If P1 approves M2 (alone or with M1): M2 wins

If I approve both:
- If P1 approves only M1: M1 wins (bad for me)
- Reduces my chance of getting the superior M2

Since M2 is weakly better than M1, I should approve only M2 to maximize the probability of its selection.

```json
{"M1": false, "M2": true}
```

The payoff matrix for the original game (P1, P2) is as follows:
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

With the addition of the mediator (A2), the payoffs are modified because the mediator's action depends on how many players delegate (A2) to it:
- If only Player 1 delegates (A2, A0 or A2, A1): The mediator plays A1 for P1.
- If only Player 2 delegates (A0, A2 or A1, A2): The mediator plays A1 for P2.
- If both delegate (A2, A2): The mediator plays A0 for both.

The expanded payoff matrix (P1, P2) becomes:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A0, A2): (0, 3) (Mediator plays A1 for P2)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)
- (A1, A2): (3, 3) (Mediator plays A1 for P2)
- (A2, A0): (3, 0) (Mediator plays A1 for P1)
- (A2, A1): (3, 3) (Mediator plays A1 for P1)
- (A2, A2): (5, 5) (Mediator plays A0 for both)

Analysis:
1.  **Dominance**: Action A2 weakly dominates action A1. For Player 2, A2 results in the same payoffs as A1 if Player 1 plays A0 or A1 (3 points), but a higher payoff if Player 1 also plays A2 (5 vs 3).
2.  **Safety (Maximin)**: A2 and A1 are safer than A0. The minimum payoff for A2 is 3, while the minimum payoff for A0 is 0.
3.  **Coordination**: The game has two primary Pareto-efficient Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A2, A2). Both yield 5 points. However, (A2, A2) is more risk-dominant. If you play A2 and the other player deviates to A0 or A1, you still receive 3 points. If you play A0 and the other player deviates to A2 or A1, you receive 0 points.
4.  **The Mediator**: The mediator's design specifically protects the delegating player by playing the "safe" action (A1) if only one player delegates, while allowing for the maximum payoff (A0) if both players delegate. This effectively makes A2 the superior choice for coordinating toward the (5, 5) outcome.

Given these factors, delegating to the mediator is the most rational and robust strategy.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We have a game between two players, and each chooses between **A0** and **A1**.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 2: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

We are **Player 2**, and we want to maximize **our** points.

But now, there's a twist: **we can delegate our move to a mediator.**

---

### **Step 2: Understand the delegation mechanism**

There is a mediator that can be chosen by either player.

- If **only one player** delegates, the mediator plays **A1**.
- If **both players** delegate, the mediator plays **A0**.
- If **no one** delegates, no mediator is used — each player acts independently.

We can now choose from three actions:
- A0
- A1
- A2 (Delegate to Mediator)

We must choose a **probability distribution** over A0, A1, and A2, such that the total is 100%.

Our goal: maximize expected payoff, accounting for the possibility of delegation and its consequences.

---

### **Step 3: Model the game with delegation**

Let’s denote:
- Let **p** = probability that you (Player 2) choose A2 (Delegate)
- Let **q** = probability that Player 1 chooses A2 (Delegate)

(We’ll define variables accordingly.)

Then we have 4 possible scenarios based on delegation decisions:

---

### **Case 1: You delegate (A2), Player 1 does not delegate (chooses A0 or A1)**
- Then **only you** delegated → mediator plays **A1** for you.
- Player 1 plays their own strategy (some mix over A0 and A1).
- So your action is **A1**, Player 1's action is random based on their choice (A0 or A1).

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability **r**, A1 with probability **1−r**.

Then, expected payoff to you:
- If Player 1 plays A0: you (A1) vs A0 → you get **3**
- If Player 1 plays A1: you (A1) vs A1 → you get **3**

So, regardless of what Player 1 does, **you get 3 points**.

So if you delegate and Player 1 does not, your payoff is **3**.

---

### **Case 2: You do not delegate (A0 or A1), Player 1 delegates**
- Then **only Player 1** delegated → mediator plays **A1** for Player 1.
- You (Player 2) play A0 or A1 (depending on your action).
- So Player 1 plays A1.

Your expected payoff depends on your action (A0 or A1), and Player 1’s action is **A1**.

So:
- If you play A0: you get **0** (since A0 vs A1 → 0)
- If you play A1: you get **3** (A1 vs A1 → 3)

So if you are not delegating and Player 1 is, your payoff is:
- 0 if you play A0
- 3 if you play A1

---

### **Case 3: Both delegate (you and Player 1 both choose A2)**
- Then **two players** delegated → mediator plays **A0** for both of you.
- So both players play **A0**.
- Payoff: (5, 5)

So your payoff is **5**.

---

### **Case 4: Neither delegates**
- Both play independently (A0 or A1).
- This is just the base game again.

Payoff depends on your choice (A0 or A1) and Player 1’s choice (A0 or A1).

Let’s suppose:
- You play A0 with probability **x**
- You play A1 with probability **1−x**
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability **r**
- Player 1 plays A1 with probability **1−r**

Then your expected payoff in this case is:
- A0 vs A0: 5 → with prob x·r
- A0 vs A1: 0 → with prob x·(1−r)
- A1 vs A0: 3 → with prob (1−x)·r
- A1 vs A1: 3 → with prob (1−x)·(1−r)

So expected payoff:
E = 5xr + 0 + 3(1−x)r + 3(1−x)(1−r)  
= 5xr + 3r(1−x) + 3(1−x)(1−r)

Let’s expand:
= 5xr + 3r − 3xr + 3(1−x−r+xr)
= (5xr − 3xr) + 3r + 3 − 3x − 3r + 3xr
= 2xr + 3 − 3x + 3xr
= 3 − 3x + 5xr

Alternatively, simplify directly:

E = 5xr + 3r(1−x) + 3(1−x)(1−r)

= 5xr + 3r − 3xr + 3(1−x − r + xr)
= 2xr + 3r + 3 − 3x − 3r + 3xr
= 2xr + 3xr + 3 − 3x − 3r + 3r → Wait, let’s re-calculate:

Wait:
3r(1−x) = 3r − 3r x  
3(1−x)(1−r) = 3(1 − r − x + xr) = 3 − 3r − 3x + 3xr

So altogether:
5xr + (3r − 3r x) + (3 − 3r − 3x + 3xr)
= 5xr − 3r x + 3xr + 3r − 3r + 3 − 3x
= (5xr − 3xr + 3xr) + 0 + 3 − 3x
= 5xr + 3 − 3x

Yes: **E = 5xr − 3x + 3**

So in case neither delegates, your expected payoff is **3 − 3x + 5xr**

---

### **Step 4: Now consider all your choices**

You must choose probabilities:
- A0: p₀
- A1: p₁
- A2 (delegate): p₂

with p₀ + p₁ + p₂ = 100

Your total expected payoff is the sum over all cases:

Let’s denote:
- q = probability that Player 1 delegates (i.e., chooses A2)
- Then (1−q) = Player 1 does not delegate.

But we **do not know q** — we must assume a best response to **some strategy of Player 1**.

But since we are acting in a *strategic environment*, and Player 1 is also rational, we should look for a **Nash equilibrium**, or at least a **best response** under symmetry or rational expectation.

But note: **you are Player 2**, and you must choose your strategy. But Player 1 chooses independently. So we can assume **self-consistency** — a symmetric equilibrium or a mutual best response.

But let’s consider whether **delegation is beneficial**.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze whether delegation can help**

Let’s suppose **Player 1 is rational and might also delegate**.

Let’s suppose **both players are symmetric** in behavior. Could there be a symmetric equilibrium?

Suppose **both players use the same strategy**: randomize between A0, A1, A2 with equal or some probability.

But perhaps we can do better by analyzing incentives.

---

### **Key Insight: What happens if both delegate?**

→ Both play A0 → you get 5.

But if only **one** delegates, the mediator plays A1.

So if **you delegate but they don’t**, you play A1, they play their choice.

If **they delegate but you don’t**, they play A1, you play your choice.

So you can **only gain from delegation** if you **expect the other to delegate**, or if you want to **force A1**.

But notice: **You get 5 only if both delegate**.

So if you **can coordinate** on both delegating, you get 5.

But if only one delegates, you get 3 (if you delegate), or 0 or 3 (if you don’t delegate), depending.

Let’s suppose Player 1 is playing some strategy. What is your best response?

But since we are choosing *simultaneously*, and **no communication**, we must consider **mixed strategies**.

But here’s a different idea: **Is A2 a dominant strategy? Does it help?**

Let’s try to find **your best response** to various Player 1 strategies.

But since we don’t know what Player 1 does, and we want to maximize **expected payoff**, we need to pick a strategy that is **robust**.

But note: **The mediator exists and is fixed** — it behaves based on number of delegations.

Let’s suppose **you choose to always delegate (p₂ = 100)**.

Then:
- If Player 1 does **not** delegate → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1.
  - So your action is A1.
  - Player 1 plays A0 or A1.
  - Then:
    - If Player 1 plays A0: you get 3
    - If Player 1 plays A1: you get 3
    → You get **3** in this case.
- If Player 1 **delegates**: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get **5**.

So if you always delegate:
- Your expected payoff = q·5 + (1−q)·3 = 3 + 2q

where q = probability Player 1 delegates.

So your expected payoff **increases with q** — the more likely Player 1 is to delegate, the better for you.

But if q is low, you get only 3.

Now suppose you **never delegate**, but instead mix A0 and A1.

Then you are playing the base game.

Let’s look for the **Nash equilibrium in the base game (without delegation)**.

---

### **Step 6: Find Nash equilibrium of the base game**

Payoff for Player 2 (you):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| P2: A0   | 5      | 0      |
| P2: A1   | 3      | 3      |

Let’s find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let P1 play A0 with probability r, A1 with 1−r.

Player 2 (you) wants to be indifferent between A0 and A1.

Expected payoff from A0: 5r + 0(1−r) = 5r  
Expected payoff from A1: 3r + 3(1−r) = 3r + 3 − 3r = 3

Set equal: 5r = 3 → r = 3/5 = 0.6

So if Player 1 plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%, then you are indifferent.

Thus, Player 2 can play any mix — but to make Player 1 indifferent, we can find the inverse.

Suppose you play A0 with probability x, A1 with 1−x.

Player 1’s payoff:
- A0: 5x + 0(1−x) = 5x
- A1: 3x + 3(1−x) = 3

Set equal: 5x = 3 → x = 3/5 = 0.6

So **Nash equilibrium**: both players play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

Then expected payoff:
- For each player: 5*(0.6)*(0.6) + 0*(0.6)*(0.4) + 3*(0.4)*(0.6) + 3*(0.4)*(0.4)  
= 5*0.36 + 0 + 3*0.24 + 3*0.16  
= 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

So in the base game, equilibrium payoff is **3.0**.

Now, **if you delegate with probability 1**, your expected payoff is:  
3 + 2q, where q = Player 1’s delegation probability.

But in equilibrium, if both players are symmetric, they might have same delegation probability.

But **if neither delegates**, we get 3.0.

But if both **choose to delegate**, then both play A0 → you get 5.

So **both would benefit from both delegating**, getting 5 > 3.

So **both delegating is Pareto superior**.

But the problem: **can you coordinate on both delegating?**

But **no communication** — simultaneous move.

So the issue is: if you delegate, and Player 1 **doesn’t**, you get 3, but Player 1 gets 3 as well (since they play A1? Wait — no!)

Wait: if you delegate, and Player 1 **does not**, then:
- You play A1 (mediator)
- Player 1 plays A0 or A1

→ If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 3, they get 0
→ If Player 1 plays A1 → you get 3, they get 3

So Player 1 might **not want to delegate**, because if **they** delegate, and you **don’t**, then they play A1.

So let’s check incentives.

---

### **Step 7: Check for equilibrium where both delegate**

Suppose both players **always delegate** (p=100 for both).

Then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both
- So both play A0
- You get 5
- Player 1 gets 5

Now, ask: is this an equilibrium?

Can a player **deviate profitably**?

Suppose you deviate: instead of delegating, you play A0.

Then:
- You play A0
- Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- So you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0, they get 3

So you get 0 < 5 → **bad for you**.

If you deviate and play A1:
- You play A1
- Player 1 plays A1 (from delegation)
- You get 3 < 5 → still worse.

So **if both delegate, you don’t want to deviate**.

What if Player 1 wants to deviate?

If Player 1 stops delegating and plays A0:
- You are still delegating → you play A1
- Player 1 plays A0
- So you: A1 vs A0 → you get 3
- Player 1: A0 vs A1 → they get 0 < 5 → bad.

If Player 1 plays A1:
- You: A1 vs A1 → you get 3
- Player 1: A1 vs A1 → they get 3 < 5 → still worse.

So **both** players prefer to **keep delegating**.

Thus, **(Delegation, Delegation) is a Nash equilibrium**.

Moreover, it gives **5 points each**, which is better than the base game's 3.

So **this is a Pareto-superior equilibrium**.

But is it the only one?

What if only one delegates?

Suppose you delegate, Player 1 does not.

Then:
- You play A1 (mediator)
- Player 1 plays (say) A0 or A1

Then:
- You get 3 regardless
- Player 1: gets 0 if they play A0, 3 if A1

So Player 1 would prefer to play A1 in response.

So if they know you delegated, they would play A1 to get 3.

Then you get 3, they get 3.

But if **both** could commit to delegate, they get 5.

So **delegation leads to better outcome**.

But since the delegation equilibrium is **stable** and gives **5**, which is better than 3, we should aim for it.

But can we **achieve it with a mixed strategy**?

Suppose we **randomize**, but not with 100%.

But since (Delegation, Delegation) is a Nash equilibrium, and it's **strictly better**, and **no incentive to deviate**, then **rational players should coordinate on this outcome — if they can**.

But since we can’t communicate, the key question: **can we guarantee it by choosing a strategy?**

If we **always delegate**, then:
- If Player 1 also delegates, we get 5.
- If Player 1 does not delegate, we get 3.

So your payoff is 3 + 2q, where q = P(Player 1 delegates)

But if Player 1 is rational, they will **also prefer to delegate only if they expect you to delegate**.

Suppose Player 1 thinks: "If I delegate, and Player 2 delegates, I get 5. If I don’t, and Player 2 delegates, I get 3 (if Player 2 plays A1, and I play A1) → wait, no:

Wait: if I don’t delegate, and Player 2 delegates → Player 2 plays A1, I play my action.

If I play A0: I get 0
If I play A1: I get 3

So I would play A1 → get 3.

So if Player 2 delegates, and I don't, I get 3.

If I delegate, and they do, I get 5.

So **I prefer to delegate if they do**.

But if **they don’t**, then:
- If I delegate → I play A1 (mediator) → Player 2 plays A1 → so (A1 vs A1) → I get 3
- If I don’t delegate → I play A1 → same → I get 3

So if you **don’t** delegate, I get 3 whether I delegate or not.

So no incentive to delegate if you don’t.

Thus, **Player 1 will only delegate if they believe you will delegate**.

So **if you always delegate**, Player 1 knows that:
- If they delegate: both delegate → they get 5
- If they don’t: only they? No — if **you** delegate, and they don’t, then only you delegate → mediator plays A1 for you → so you play A1.

Then:
- If Player 1 plays A0: they get 0
- If they play A1: they get 3

So they get **3** if they don’t delegate, and **5** if they do.

So they will **want to delegate**.

So **if you delegate (always), then Player 1’s best response is to delegate** → both delegate → you get 5.

Thus, **your strategy: "always delegate"** leads to **equilibrium outcome: both delegate → you get 5**.

Is that true?

Yes. Because:
- You always delegate → so if Player 1 deviates to not delegating, they get 3 at most (if they play A1).
- But if they delegate, they get 5 (since you delegate).
- So they will delegate.

So **(Always Delegate, Always Delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Moreover, it gives **5** points.

In the base game, maximum you can get is 5 — but only in one case.

But in that equilibrium, you get **5 guaranteed**.

Now, is there a better strategy?

Suppose you mix.

For example, suppose you delegate with 70%, play A0 with 30%.

Then if Player 1 delegates, you get 5 only if both delegate.

But probability both delegate is 70% × q.

Besides, you get less than 5 in other cases.

But in the **always delegate** strategy, you **get 5** in equilibrium.

And since the other player has incentive to match, it’s **stable**.

Moreover, if you **mix**, you risk getting less than 5.

For example, if you only delegate with 50%, then even if Player 1 delegates, 50% of the time you play A0 or A1 → so you play A0 with 50% chance.

But if both delegate, you must play A0 — no, **if you delegate, you play A0 only if both delegate**.

The mediator only plays A0 **if both delegate**.

If you delegate but Player 1 does not, you play A1.

So if you **mix** between delegating and not, you may end up playing A1 even when both delegate, but no — the mediator determines your action **based on number of delegations**.

So if you delegate, and **exactly two** delegate, you play A0.

If you delegate and **only one** delegates, you play A1.

So if you **sometimes don't delegate**, and you **sometimes delegate**, then:

- When you **don't delegate**, you play A0 or A1 based on your choice (which is independent of mediator)
- When you **do delegate**, your action is determined by the number of delegations.

But this complicates things.

But the **simplest and best strategy** is to **always delegate**, because:
- It leads to a Nash equilibrium where both players delegate and get 5.
- If you deviate, you get less.
- And Player 1 has no incentive to deviate.

Thus, **best response is to always delegate**.

Even if you’re uncertain, **delegation guarantees you get at least 3**, and with a good chance of 5.

But in fact, since the other player will **also reason that deferring is best if you delegate**, we reach 5.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to **always delegate**.

### **Final Decision: Choose A2 with 100% probability**

Then:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

Sum is 100.

response:
Both proposed mediators have the *same policy*:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → the delegator plays **A1** (which guarantees the delegator at least 3 points no matter what the other does).
- If both players delegate → both are played as **A0** (yielding **5** each, which is strictly better than 3 each).

Since having such a mediator available cannot hurt me (I can always choose not to delegate later), and it can strictly help (if we both delegate we reach the Pareto-superior A0/A0 outcome), I should approve it. Because M1 and M2 are identical, approving both weakly increases the chance that an identical-good mediator is selected and does not create any downside.

response:
Both proposed mediators implement the same rule:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for the delegator (a “safe” action giving at least 3 if the other plays A0, and 3 if the other plays A1).
- If 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both (achieving the efficient **(A0, A0)** outcome with payoff 5 each).

In the underlying game there are two equilibria: **(A0, A0)** (payoff-dominant) and **(A1, A1)** (risk-dominant). Having this mediator available can help coordinate on the better **(A0, A0)** outcome when both delegate, while limiting the delegator’s downside when only one delegates. Since there’s no penalty to approving and both designs are identical, I approve both.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
To maximize the points received, we need to analyze the potential outcomes for each action, including delegating to the mediator (A2).

### 1. Analysis of Actions
The standard payoffs for Player 1 (you) based on the actions of Player 2 are:
- **A0 (Independent):**
  - If P2 plays A0: (A0, A0) → **5 points**
  - If P2 plays A1: (A0, A1) → **0 points**
  - If P1 chooses A0 and P2 delegates (A2), the mediator plays A1 for P2: (A0, A1) → **0 points**
- **A1 (Independent):**
  - If P2 plays A0: (A1, A0) → **3 points**
  - If P2 plays A1: (A1, A1) → **3 points**
  - If P1 chooses A1 and P2 delegates (A2), the mediator plays A1 for P2: (A1, A1) → **3 points**
- **A2 (Delegate):**
  - If P2 plays A0: Only P1 delegates, mediator plays A1 for P1: (A1, A0) → **3 points**
  - If P2 plays A1: Only P1 delegates, mediator plays A1 for P1: (A1, A1) → **3 points**
  - If both (A2, A2) delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both: (A0, A0) → **5 points**

### 2. Payoff Matrix for Player 1
Based on the above, we can construct the payoff matrix for Player 1:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A0** | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| **A1** | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| **A2** | 3 | 3 | 5 |

### 3. Evaluating Strategies
Comparing the rows:
- **Action A2 strictly dominates Action A1.** For every possible move by Player 2, A2 results in a payoff greater than or equal to A1 (3 vs 3, 3 vs 3, and 5 vs 3). Therefore, A1 is never the optimal choice.
- **Action A2 vs. Action A0.** A0 is only superior if P2 is guaranteed to play A0 (yielding 5 vs 3). However, A0 is extremely risky; if P2 plays A1 or A2, the payoff for A0 drops to 0. Conversely, A2 is much safer, guaranteeing a minimum of 3 points and offering the same maximum of 5 points if both players delegate.

### 4. Coordination and Nash Equilbria
This game has two primary Nash Equilibria: (**A0, A0**) and (**A2, A2**), both yielding (5, 5). 
- Between these two, (**A2, A2**) is risk-dominant. If you deviate from (A2, A2) by mistake, the minimum payoff is 3. If you deviate from (A0, A0), the minimum payoff is 0.
- Given that the mediator was selected via approval voting, there is a strong signal that both players intend to utilize it to reach the (5,5) payoff safely.

Since Action A2 provides the same potential upside as A0 with a significantly higher security floor (maximin of 3 vs 0), it is the most robust and rational choice.

response:
To make the best decision about which mediators to approve, let’s analyze their impact on the potential payoffs and our strategy.

### Game Payoff Analysis
First, clarify the payoffs:
1. (A0, A0) => (5, 5)
2. (A0, A1) => (0, 3)
3. (A1, A0) => (3, 0)
4. (A1, A1) => (3, 3)

### Strategy Analysis
Considering that both players would like to maximize their payoffs, aligning strategies to the (A0, A0) outcome gives the highest combined total points (10 points).

### Mediator Analysis

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- If 1 player delegates to the mediator, it will play action A1.
- If 2 players delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- If 1 player delegates to the mediator, it will play action A0.
- If 2 players delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

### Evaluation of Mediators

1. **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
   - If only Player 1 delegates, the mediator plays A1. Thus, if I choose A0 (independently), the outcomes will be 0 points for me and 3 points for Player 1 which is not optimal for me.
   - If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0. This leads to 5 points each, which is optimal for both.
   - If only I delegate, the mediator plays A1. This means Player 1 gets 0 if they play A0 independently (3 points for me if they play A1). This scenario isn’t great for me unless Player 1 is likely to also play A1, but it balances the risk as 3 points each.

2. **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
   - If either or both players delegate, the mediator will play A0.
   - This means I can ensure 5 points for myself by delegating regardless of the other player’s decision (assuming they also act rationally).

### Approval Decision
To maximize the expected payoff for me, I should focus on ensuring rational behavior that aligns with my interest of maximizing total points.

- **Mediator proposed by Player 1:** The unknown play of Player 1 can risk points for me.
- **Mediator proposed by Player 2:** Consistently proposes A0, leading to optimal mutual benefit.

Considering these points, I would approve the mediator proposed by Player 2 and disapprove the one proposed by Player 1.

Both proposed mediators are identical:

- If only one player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** (a “safe” action when you’re unsure the other will delegate).
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0**, yielding the best mutual outcome (5,5).

Since **M1 and M2 implement the same rule**, there’s no strategic downside to approving either one, and approving both weakly increases the chance that an acceptable mediator is selected (in case the other player’s approvals create a tie set).

response:
Both proposed mediators have the exact same policy:

- If exactly **1** player delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2** players delegate → mediator plays **A0**

In the underlying payoff matrix, the best mutual outcome is **(A0, A0)** giving me **5**. The mediator makes that outcome achievable if both players delegate (since it plays **A0** when 2 delegate). Meanwhile, if I delegate but the other player does not, the mediator plays **A1** for me, which avoids the worst-case risk of me playing **A0** alone and getting **0**.

So having either mediator available is beneficial, and since they are identical, I should approve both.

The payoffs in this game are as follows (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this coordination game, both players receive 5 points if they choose A0, but this is risky because if the other player chooses A1, the player who chose A0 receives 0 points. On the other hand, choosing A1 is safe, as it yields 3 points regardless of the other player's decision.

The proposed mediators (M1 and M2) act as a coordination mechanism. Both mediators are identical and operate with the following rules:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator plays action A1 for that player. This ensures the player receives their "safe" payoff of 3 points.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays action A0 for both players. This ensures both players receive the maximum payoff of 5 points.

By delegating to either of these mediators, a player eliminates the risk of receiving 0 points. If the other player also delegates, both players reach the optimal (5, 5) outcome. If the other player does not delegate, the mediator plays A1, guaranteeing the player 3 points. In this case, delegation becomes a dominant strategy, as it leads to either 5 points (if the opponent coordinates) or 3 points (if the opponent does not), effectively removing the risk associated with trying to reach the higher payoff.

Since both M1 and M2 are identical and provide this beneficial coordination service, it is in Player 2's best interest to approve both.

response:
Delegating (A2) is at least as good as playing **A1** in every situation, because:

- If I delegate and the other player **does not** delegate, then exactly **1** player delegated, so the mediator plays **A1** for me. That guarantees me **3 points** regardless of whether the other player ends up playing A0 or A1.
- If I delegate and the other player **also** delegates, then **2** players delegated, so the mediator plays **A0** for both of us, giving me **5 points**.

So **A2** guarantees the same “safe” payoff as A1 (3 points), with an added upside (5 points) when the other player also delegates. That makes putting full probability on **A2** optimal.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand my payoffs (as Player 2)

Let me write the payoff matrix from my perspective:
```
              P1: A0    P1: A1
My A0           5         0
My A1           3         3
```

## Step 2: Analyze what each mediator does

**M1 (Player 1's proposal):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**M2 (My proposal):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A0
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 3: Analyze outcomes with M1

Let me consider all delegation scenarios:

- **Both delegate:** M1 plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get **5 points**
- **Only I delegate:** M1 plays A1 for me; P1's best response to my A1 is A1 (gets 3 vs 0) → (A1, A1) → I get **3 points**
- **Only P1 delegates:** M1 plays A1 for P1; my best response to P1's A1 is A1 (I get 3 vs 0) → (A1, A1) → I get **3 points**
- **Neither delegates:** Original game Nash equilibrium (A0, A0) → I get **5 points**

Delegation game payoffs with M1:
```
              P1: Delegate    P1: Not
Delegate         (5, 5)       (3, 3)
Not              (3, 3)       (5, 5)
```

This creates coordination risk - miscoordination leads to only 3 points!

## Step 4: Analyze outcomes with M2

- **Both delegate:** M2 plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get **5 points**
- **Only I delegate:** M2 plays A0 for me; P1's best response to my A0 is A0 (gets 5 vs 3) → (A0, A0) → I get **5 points**
- **Only P1 delegates:** M2 plays A0 for P1; my best response to P1's A0 is A0 (I get 5 vs 3) → (A0, A0) → I get **5 points**
- **Neither delegates:** Original game Nash equilibrium (A0, A0) → I get **5 points**

Delegation game payoffs with M2:
```
              P1: Delegate    P1: Not
Delegate         (5, 5)       (5, 5)
Not              (5, 5)       (5, 5)
```

M2 **guarantees 5 points regardless of delegation choices!**

## Step 5: Decision

M2 is strictly better because:
- It eliminates coordination risk
- It guarantees the maximum payoff (5 points) in all cases
- M1 risks getting only 3 points if coordination fails

M2 is also better for Player 1 for the same reasons, so it's a Pareto improvement.

{"M1": false, "M2": true}

To maximize my expected points, I want the selected mediator to make it as easy and “safe” as possible to reach the high-payoff outcome (A0, A0) = 5 each.

- **Mediator M2** always plays **A0** when delegated to (whether 1 or 2 delegators). That strongly steers play toward **(A0, A0)**, because against A0 the best response is A0. So M2 robustly supports the 5-point outcome.
- **Mediator M1** plays **A1** if only one player delegates, which can steer outcomes toward the lower-payoff coordination (A1, A1) = 3 each if delegation isn’t perfectly coordinated. So it’s weaker than M2 for achieving 5 reliably.

Also, under approval voting, approving M1 could increase the chance M1 is selected in some vote configurations, which I don’t want.

Therefore I approve only M2.

response:
To maximize total points in this coordination game, we first analyze the payoff matrix:

- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)
- (A2, A0): (5, 5) (via A0)
- (A2, A1): (0, 3) (via A0)
- (A0, A2): (5, 5) (via A0)
- (A1, A2): (3, 0) (via A0)
- (A2, A2): (5, 5) (via A0)

This is a Stag Hunt variant with two Nash Equilibria: the Pareto-superior equilibrium (A0/A2, A0/A2) yielding 5 points each, and the risk-dominant equilibrium (A1, A1) yielding 3 points each. Action A1 is a "safe" move, providing 3 points regardless of the other player's action. A0 and A2 are "risky" moves, providing 5 points if the other player coordinates on A0 or A2, but 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

We calculate the threshold for choosing the risky action:
If $p$ is the probability the other player coordinates on (A0 or A2):
- Expected value of A0/A2 = $5p + 0(1-p) = 5p$
- Expected value of A1 = $3p + 3(1-p) = 3$
The risky action (A0 or A2) is better when $5p > 3$, or $p > 0.6$.

The introduction of action A2 (Delegate to Mediator) serves as a focal point for coordination. Specifically, Player 2 proposed this mediator and it was selected via approval voting, signaling a strong intent to coordinate on the (5, 5) outcome. In such games, the presence of a signaling mechanism significantly increases the likelihood of players coordinating on the Pareto-superior strategy. Furthermore, the expected value of A2 exceeds A1 even if the opponent plays randomly (where $p = 0.66$).

Given the signaling and the high potential reward, delegating to the mediator is the most rational choice to achieve the highest points.

response:
Both proposed mediators are identical:

- If exactly 1 player delegates, the delegator is forced to play **A1**.
- If both players delegate, both are forced to play **A0**, yielding the Pareto-best outcome **(A0, A0) = (5,5)**.

So the mediator can enable coordination on the efficient equilibrium when both delegate, and since M1 and M2 have the same rule, there’s no downside (from mediator choice) to approving either one. Approving both also avoids accidentally reducing the chance that an identical, acceptable mediator is selected under approval voting.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, we need to analyze the possible choices and outcomes.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understanding Payoff Matrix for Direct Actions (A0 and A1):**

    |                | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
    |----------------|--------------|--------------|
    | Player 2: A0   | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
    | Player 2: A1   | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

2. **Considering Delegation to the Mediator (A2):**

    - If Player 2 alone delegates to the mediator, the mediator will play A0.
    - If both players delegate to the mediator, the mediator will play A0.

3. **Potential Outcomes with Delegation:**

    - **Player 1 does not delegate (plays independently A0 or A1):**
        - If Player 2 delegates (mediator plays A0):
            - Against Player 1's A0: Player 2 gets 5 points.
            - Against Player 1's A1: Player 2 gets 0 points.
    - **Player 1 delegates:**
        - If Player 2 also delegates, both will get the payoff of (5, 5) because the mediator will choose A0.

### Strategy to Maximize Expected Points:

Given the option to delegate or play independently:
- Delegation to the mediator seems beneficial if both players can be expected to delegate (resulting in a payoff of (5, 5)).
- Playing independently provides variations that can sometimes result in lower payoffs due to the possibility of the other player choosing A1.

### Mixed Strategy Approach:

To maximize expected value:
1. **High probability for delegation:** Delegation ensures a consistent (5, 5) outcome when both players delegate.
2. **Low probability for independent actions:** Independent actions could lead to variable outcomes, which might be less optimal than consistent (5, 5).

### Final Recommendation:

We can assign a very high probability to delegation and assign the remaining slight probabilities to the independent actions, just in case the other player does not delegate.

Thus, the probability distribution could be:
- Delegate to the mediator (A2): 90%
- Independent actions (A0 and A1) lower probabilities to allow for a mix while leaning heavily towards delegation.

### JSON Object Format:

Here is the proposed decision expressed as a JSON object:

```json
{"A0": 5, "A1": 5, "A2": 90}
```

This indicates a strong bias towards delegation, with slight probabilities for independent actions to cover various scenarios.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are Player 2 in a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from **Player 2’s perspective**):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | 5        | 0        |
| **A1**              | 3        | 3        |

But note: the payoffs are symmetric in some cases, but let’s clarify:

From the description:

- (A0, A0): P2 gets 5
- (A0, A1): P2 gets 0
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 3
- (A1, A1): P2 gets 3

So from **Player 2’s** viewpoint:

- If P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A0 → 5
- If P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A1 → 0
- If P2 plays A1 and P1 plays A0 → 3
- If P2 plays A1 and P1 plays A1 → 3

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium of this base game.

Let:
- P2 play A0 with probability p
- P1 play A0 with probability q

Player 2’s expected payoff:

- If P2 plays A0: 5*q + 0*(1−q) = 5q
- If P2 plays A1: 3*q + 3*(1−q) = 3

Set equal for indifference (best response):

5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So P2 mixes when P1 plays A0 with 0.6.

Similarly, for P1’s indifference:

- If P1 plays A0: 5*p + 0*(1−p) = 5p
- If P1 plays A1: 3*p + 3*(1−p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So the **unique Nash equilibrium** is both players play A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

Expected payoff for each player:
- E = 0.6*0.6*5 + 0.6*0.4*0 + 0.4*0.6*3 + 0.4*0.4*3
- = 0.36*5 + 0 + 0.24*3 + 0.16*3
- = 1.8 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

So, **in equilibrium, expected payoff is 3.0 points per player**.

But now comes the **twist**: we can delegate our move to a mediator, and we vote on which mediator(s) to approve. The winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with the *maximum* number of approvals.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Designs**

There are **two mediators proposed**, both by Players 1 and 2 respectively. But both are **identical** in behavior:

> **Mediator proposed by Player 1 (M1):**
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

> **Mediator proposed by Player 2 (M2):**
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So **M1 and M2 are functionally identical** in their behavior.

But the question is: Which ones do *you* (Player 2) approve?

You are Player 2.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Delegation Implications**

Recall: you can choose to:
- **Act independently** (set your own probability distribution over A0/A1)
- Or **delegate** your move to a mediator

But the mediator only plays *if you delegate*. The mediator's action depends on **how many players have delegated to it**.

Note: Each player can choose to delegate **to one mediator**, or not delegate at all.

But importantly, **mediators are selected via approval voting**. Only mediators with *maximum approvals* are candidates; one is chosen uniformly at random.

So your approval decides whether your preferred mediator is *available*.

Since both mediators are identical in behavior, **do you care which one wins**?

No — because their behaviors are the same.

So **you should approve both**, because:

- You want the mediator to be available in case you **want to delegate**.
- Since M1 and M2 are identical, approving both increases the chance that **your choice is represented**, and **increases the likelihood of a mediator being available**.
- Moreover, if no one approves a mediator, it won’t be selected.

But wait: if you approve *only one*, and the other is approved by someone else, then potentially the **winner** might not be the one you prefer — but since both behave identically, you don’t care.

So why not approve both?

Let’s think: what is the **goal**?

> Maximize your **total points** received in the game.

You only get points if **you are not delegating** and you play a strategy, or you **are delegating** and the mediator plays for you.

You can also *choose* whether to delegate or not.

But here’s the catch: **you are only allowed to vote on which mediators to approve**, and **not** decide your own action (yet). The approval vote is a **before** the game begins.

But you’re free to choose later whether to delegate or not.

So your goal is: **maximize expected payoff**, considering:
- Your choice of whether to delegate
- The mediator selected (based on approvals)
- The other player’s behavior

But note: the **other player is not necessarily rational**. However, since we’re trying to maximize our payoff, we must assume both players will act in their own self-interest, including when choosing to delegate or not.

But here is a **crucial observation**:

- The two mediators behave **identically**.
- So approving both doesn’t hurt you — you get the same outcome regardless of which mediates is chosen.
- But if you **don’t approve M2**, and M2 isn’t approved by anyone (say, only M1 is approved), then M1 becomes the winner. But you still **can** delegate to M1, and it behaves the same.

But what if **neither** is approved? Then no mediator exists — and you can’t delegate.

But you’re Player 2. You can choose to act independently in that case.

So, to **protect your ability to delegate** if needed, you should **approve at least one of them**.

But since they are identical, and both are available to you *if approved*, and **you don’t gain anything from disapproving one**, then **you should approve both**.

Why?

- Approving both increases the chance that the mediator is available.
- Since the mediator behavior is identical regardless of which one wins, you gain **no downside**.
- But there is a **potential upside**: if someone else likes the mediator, you want it to win — but since you control your own approval, you can support both candidates.

Wait: the **selection** of the winning mediator is from those with **maximum approvals**.

So if you approve **both**, then:
- M1 and M2 both get your approval.
- If no one else approves any, then both have 1.
- So both are tied for max → one is selected uniformly at random → you still have a 50% chance of getting each — but since they're identical, doesn’t matter.

But suppose someone else approves only M1. Then:
- M1: 2 approvals (you + them)
- M2: 1 approval
→ M1 wins

But you still get M1, which is identical to M2.

So no difference.

But what if **no one** approves M2? Then M2 is not a candidate — even if you approve it, if only you approve it, and no one else does, and someone else approves M1, then M1 wins.

But again: same outcome.

So **the only thing that matters is that a mediator is available**.

But suppose **neither** is approved by anyone. Then no mediator exists → no delegation possible.

So if you **don’t approve any**, you risk that **no mediator exists**, and you can’t delegate, even if you want to.

But if you approve **both**, then at least **you** support both — so even if no one else approves any, both have 1 approval → both are tied → one is selected → delegation is possible.

Therefore, to **ensure delegation is possible** and to **maximize your options**, you should approve **both**.

Moreover, you **always benefit from having the option to delegate**, because:
- If the mediator strategy leads to better outcome than self-play, you can delegate.
- The mediator's action depends on how many people delegate.

Let’s analyze what happens **if you delegate**.

**Case 1: You delegate to a mediator.**

Then:
- The mediator’s action depends on the **total number of delegations to it** (i.e., number of players who chose to delegate *to this mediator*).

But note: **only one mediator is active** — the winner.

So, suppose the winning mediator is chosen.

Then:
- If 1 player delegates to the mediator → it plays A1
- If 2 players delegate to it → it plays A0

So what happens if **you delegate**, and the other player does not?

→ Only you delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 3 points if other plays A0, and 3 if other plays A1 → always 3.

If **you delegate**, and **other player delegates** → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → you get:
- 5 if other plays A0
- 0 if other plays A1

So your payoff depends on the other player’s action.

Now compare this to **not delegating** and choosing your own action.

But you can **choose** whether to delegate, so you can pick the best strategy.

But remember: we are only at the **approval phase**.

We are **not** choosing how to act yet — we’re only deciding which mediators to approve.

So what should your approval strategy be?

Let’s suppose the other player is rational. They will also think about delegation.

But for **you**, as Player 2, your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff**, and you control your own approval.

Now, **what’s the best strategy**?

Suppose you **approve both**.

Then both are in the running.

Suppose the other player also approves one or both.

Then one of M1 or M2 will be selected (with equal chance if tied), but their behavior is identical.

So it doesn’t matter.

Now, **you may want to delegate** only if it gives you better outcome.

Let’s consider **if you delegate, and the other player doesn’t**.

→ You play A1 (since 1 delegate → mediator plays A1)

Your payoff = 3 (as before, regardless of other player’s action)

But if you play independently, you can try to play A0 with 0.6 probability → expected payoff 3.0

Same as 3. So same payoff.

But if you **both delegate**, then:
- 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
→ If other player plays A0 → you get 5
→ If other player plays A1 → you get 0

But the other player is also rational.

So if both of you **delegate**, and the mediator plays A0, then each gets 5 if the other plays A0, 0 if the other plays A1.

So both players have **incentive to play A0**, which leads to 5.

But if one plays A1, they get 0.

So **if both delegate**, and mediator plays A0, it’s like a **coordination game**: both want to match.

But the other player may not want to play A0 — they might prefer to play A1 if they think you’re playing A0.

Wait, but in this case, **the mediator sets the action**.

You play A0 (if both delegate), so you play A0.

Now, suppose you **both delegate**, and mediator plays A0 → both play A0.

Then you get 5.

But if you both delegate, and you're both playing A0, that’s good.

But is that stable?

But suppose you **delegated** and you play A0, but the other player, also delegating, plays A0 — it’s best if the other player plays A0.

But if the other player **does not** delegate, they might play differently.

But we are trying to **maximize expected payoff**.

Let’s consider **a strategy where you always delegate**.

But you can't commit — you can only choose **whether to delegate** at the time.

But the point is: **you want to approve both mediators** because:

1. They behave identically → no downside to approving both.
2. You don’t want to risk that **no mediator is available**, in which case you can't delegate even if you want to.
3. If you approve only one, and the other player approves the other, and you both delegate, then **the available mediator is one of them**, but you can still delegate to it — and the outcome is the same.
4. But if you disapprove both, then **no mediator will be selected** → you cannot delegate → you must play independently → but that’s okay, you can still play a strategy.

But **if you disapprove both**, you lose the option to delegate, even if it’s beneficial.

Is delegation ever beneficial?

Let’s suppose both players **prefer** the 5-5 outcome.

But in the base game, no pure Nash equilibrium gives 5-5 — (A0,A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium, because if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers to play A1 (3 > 5? No — 3 < 5) → wait:

Wait: if P1 plays A0, what does P2 want?

- Play A0 → get 5
- Play A1 → get 3

So P2 prefers A0 → so given P1 plays A0, P2 wants to play A0.

Similarly, if P1 plays A1:
- P2 plays A0 → 0
- P2 plays A1 → 3

So P2 prefers A1.

So the **only Nash equilibrium** is mixed: both play A0 with 0.6.

But if both players could **coordinate** on A0, they’d both get 5 — better than 3.

But they can’t, because it’s not self-enforcing.

Now, here’s the key: **delegation can help coordinate**.

Suppose you **both delegate** to a mediator.

Then:
- 2 delegations → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → both get 5.

This is **Pareto superior**.

But only if **both** delegate.

So if you can coordinate on **both delegating**, then both benefit.

But the mediator only plays A0 if **both** delegate.

If only one delegates → A1 → you get 3.

If both delegate → A0 → you get 5 (if other plays A0) — but since both are delegating, both are playing A0 → so you **do** get 5.

So if **both delegate**, you get **5**.

If only one delegates, you get **3**.

If neither delegates, you can play independently — expected payoff 3.0.

So **if both delegate**, both get 5.

So **you want both to delegate**, but only if the other player also wants to.

But if you **approve both mediators**, you are enabling the possibility of **both delegating** and getting 5.

But if you **disapprove both**, then no mediator exists → you **cannot delegate**, so you have to play independently → max expected payoff 3.

But if you approve at least one, then you **can delegate**, and potentially get 5.

So **approving at least one mediator is better than disapproving both**, because it gives you the chance to get 5.

But which one?

Since M1 and M2 are identical, you should approve **both** to:
- Maximize the chance that a mediator is available
- Avoid the risk of no mediator
- Ensure you have **full control** over the choice

Is there any downside to approving both?

No.

Even if the other player dislikes the mediator, because the mediator is identical to both, it doesn’t matter.

Also, if **both** mediators are approved, then:
- The winning one is chosen uniformly at random from the max-approved.
- But since they are identical, it doesn’t matter.

So **you get the same outcome regardless**.

Thus, **approving both is strictly better** than approving only one or none.

Because:
- Approving both → guarantees at least one mediator is available (you support both), and no risk of none being available.
- Approving only one → if the other player also approves only one (say M1), and you approve M1, then M1 gets 2, M2 gets 1 → M1 wins → you’re fine.
- But if you approve only M1, and the other player approves only M2, then both have 1 → both tied → winner random → still okay, but only if you approve at least one.

But if you approve **neither**, then **no mediator can win** → no mediation → cannot delegate.

So you are **forced** to play independently → expected payoff 3.

But if you approve **at least one**, you **can delegate**, and possibly achieve 5.

So **you want to approve at least one**.

And since **both are identical**, you should approve both to **maximize your options and protect against risk**.

Therefore, **you should approve both M1 and M2**.

### ✅ Final Decision:

Approve **all** mediators, because they are identical in behavior and you want to maximize the chance that a mediator is available for delegation, which could lead to better outcomes (like 5 points) in coordinated scenarios.

	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix (from my perspective as Player 2)

```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0         5               0
Player 2: A1         3               3
```

## Step 2: Analyzing the Mediator Option

The mediator plays A0 regardless of whether 1 or 2 players delegate. This means:
- If I delegate and P1 plays A0: Both effectively play A0 → I get 5
- If I delegate and P1 plays A1: I play A0, they play A1 → I get 0  
- If I delegate and P1 delegates: Both play A0 → I get 5

**Key insight: Delegating is equivalent to playing A0**

## Step 3: Simplifying the Strategic Analysis

Since delegation = A0, the effective choice is between:
- A0/Delegate: Get 5 if opponent plays A0, get 0 if opponent plays A1
- A1: Get 3 regardless of opponent's action

## Step 4: Finding the Nash Equilibrium

Let p = probability opponent plays A0/Delegate

My expected payoffs:
- From A0/Delegate: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- From A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

I'm indifferent when: 5p = 3, so p = 0.6

The symmetric mixed Nash equilibrium is:
- Play A0/Delegate with probability 0.6
- Play A1 with probability 0.4
- Expected payoff: 3.0

## Step 5: Strategic Considerations

The mediator I proposed signals a desire to coordinate on the mutually beneficial (5,5) outcome. However, playing the safe Nash equilibrium protects against exploitation while still giving a reasonable expected value.

I'll place all the A0 probability on Delegate to show commitment to the coordination mechanism.

response:
To decide the optimal probability distribution over the actions available (i.e., A0, A1, and A2), let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Payoffs without Delegation**:
    - If both players choose A0, both get 5 points.
    - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you get 0 points, and the other player gets 3 points.
    - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, you get 3 points, and the other player gets 0 points.
    - If both choose A1, both get 3 points.

2. **Understanding the Role of the Mediator**:
    - The mediator's decisions depend on the number of delegations:
        - If 1 player delegates, the mediator will choose A1.
        - If both players delegate, the mediator will choose A0.

3. **Delegation and Its Impact**:
    - If I delegate and Player 1 does not delegate, the mediator will choose A1 for me.
    - If both players delegate, the mediator will choose A0 for both.
    - If Player 1 delegates and I do not delegate, Player 1 will have A1 due to the mediator's choice.

4. **Goals to Maximize Points**:
    - We aim to balance the strategies so that our expected payoff is maximized.
    - We need to factor in the potential actions of Player 1, taking into account the possibility that they might also delegate.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Case 1**: Both players choose A0 independently. Each receives 5 points.
- **Case 2**: Both players choose A1 independently. Each receives 3 points.
- **Case 3**: Mixing probabilities with some allocation to A2 (Delegate to Mediator) could lead to better outcomes:
   - If both players delegate, we would both end up with 5 points because the mediator picks A0.
   - If only one player delegates, the mediator picks A1 for them. If the other player independently picks A1, they both receive 3 points.

Given the mediator's strategy, it would be beneficial to delegate some percentage of the time to encourage mutual coordination towards the higher payoffs of A0 (if both delegate) or at least A1 (if only one delegates and the other picks A1).

### Optimal Strategy Calculation:
Let's calculate various outcomes with different probabilities.

1. **Pure Strategies**:
    - Pure A0 strategies would result in more stable payoffs of 5 when matched.
    - Pure A1 strategies can be a little lower with consistent 3 points.

2. **Mixed Strategies involving Delegation**:
    - Combining A0, A1, and A2 allows flexibility and potential higher average payoffs due to the mediator's predictable switch to A0.

### Final Probability Distribution:
To mix strategies optimally, let's assign a reasonable chunk to delegation and a balance between A0 and A1 for risk management.

After detailed consideration, let's use the following probabilities:
- Delegate 50% of the time to increase the chances of both picking A0.
- Independently choose A0 and A1 equally for balance.

Thus:
- Delegate (A2) = 50%
- A0 = 25%
- A1 = 25%

Here is the JSON object representing this strategy:
```json

response:
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the game without delegation**

We are Player 2 in a 2-player simultaneous move game.

The payoff matrix (from Player 2’s perspective) is:

|          | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **You: A0** | 5, 5         | 0, 3         |
| **You: A1** | 3, 0         | 3, 3         |

So, as Player 2:

- If you play A0 and Player 1 plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0 and Player 1 plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 and Player 1 plays A0 → you get 3
- If you play A1 and Player 1 plays A1 → you get 3

This is a coordination game with a twist: A0 is better if the other player also plays A0, but if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get *nothing*, whereas playing A1 gives you at least 3.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the mediator mechanism**

You have the option to **Delegate to Mediator**, which is action A2.

The mediator’s behavior depends on **how many players delegate**:

- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0

Note: You are Player 2. The other player is Player 1. Both can choose to delegate or not.

So, the mediator’s action depends on the **total number of delegators**.

We can now consider the **possible combinations** of decisions:

| Your choice | Opponent’s choice | Delegators | Mediator's action |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 0          | — (no delegation) |
| A0          | A1                | 0          | — |
| A0          | A2                | 1 (you)    | A1                |
| A1          | A0                | 0          | — |
| A1          | A1                | 0          | — |
| A1          | A2                | 1 (you)    | A1                |
| A2          | A0                | 1 (you)    | A1                |
| A2          | A1                | 1 (you)    | A1                |
| A2          | A2                | 2 (both)   | A0                |

So, depending on how both players act, the mediator will act accordingly.

---

### **Step 3: Consider possible Nash-like equilibria or optimal strategies**

We want to **maximize our expected points**, and we are allowed to randomize over A0, A1, A2.

Let’s define a mixed strategy for us:  
Let  
- p = P(Play A0)  
- q = P(Play A1)  
- r = P(Delegate to Mediator) = P(A2)

With p + q + r = 100.

We need to find optimal p, q, r.

But note: **The opponent’s strategy is unknown**. However, since this is a decision-making game where *both* players act simultaneously and we aim to maximize our own points (and presumably expect the other player to play optimally too), we should assume **rationality and symmetry**.

But in this case, **you are the one proposing the mediator**, and the mediator was selected via approval voting — meaning it's a fixed rule. But crucially, **both players can choose to delegate or not**.

But you don’t know what the other player will do — so you must choose a strategy that maximizes your expected payoff **under best response** or **in equilibrium**.

Let’s think about **stable outcomes**.

---

### **Step 4: Consider equilibrium possibilities**

We can analyze possible **equilibria** where both players use mixed strategies, including the delegation option.

But instead, let’s consider **key strategic implications**.

#### Case 1: Nobody delegates
Then both players play A0 or A1.

Best responses:
- If opponent plays A0, you prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If opponent plays A1, you prefer A1 (3 > 0)

So Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

Is (A0, A0) stable? Yes — if opponent plays A0, you get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefer A0.

Is (A1, A1) stable? Yes — if opponent plays A1, you get 3 for both A0 and A1 → indifferent. But since A0 gives 0 and A1 gives 3, you clearly prefer A1.

But there’s no incentive to deviate.

But **(A0, A0) dominates (A1, A1)** — both players get more in (A0, A0).

So rational players might converge to (A0, A0).

However, if one player expects the other to play A1, they’ll play A1.

But there is a **coordination problem**.

But now, **delegation** introduces a new mechanism.

---

### **Step 5: How can delegation improve outcomes?**

Let’s ask: **Can delegation help coordinate on A0?**

- If **both players delegate**, mediator plays A0 → both get 5 (since A0 vs A0).
- If **only one player delegates**, mediator plays A1 → that player gets 3 (A1 vs whatever the other does), but the other player’s action matters.

Let’s work through the **payoffs under delegation**.

---

### **Step 6: Compute expected payoffs under different strategies**

To find the optimal mixed strategy, we need to consider the **expected payoff** of each action (A0, A1, A2) **depending on the opponent’s strategy**.

But since the opponent is also optimizing, we assume a **symmetric equilibrium** — both players use the same strategy.

Let’s assume both players use the same mixed strategy:  
- P(A0) = p  
- P(A1) = q  
- P(A2) = r  
with p + q + r = 1

We want to find the best response that maximizes our expected payoff, assuming the opponent plays this strategy.

Instead, let’s try to **find a symmetric equilibrium** with delegation.

#### Try: Both players delegate with probability r, and randomize otherwise.

But this is complex. Let’s instead look for **simple pure strategies** or **intuitive equilibria**.

---

### **Step 7: Try a candidate equilibrium**

#### **Candidate 1: Both players delegate (A2) with probability 1**

Then both delegate → 2 delegators → mediator plays A0.

So both play A0 → both get 5 points.

This is **very good**.

Now, is this a **Nash equilibrium**?

Suppose both players are playing A2 (delegate) with probability 1.

You get 5 points.

But suppose you **deviate** and play A0 instead.

Then:
- Opponent still plays A2 (delegates)
- So only 1 delegator → mediator plays A1
- You play A0, opponent's action is A1 (since mediator plays A1)
- So you get 0 points (A0 vs A1), opponent gets 3

You get 0 < 5 → **not worth it**

Similarly, if you play A1 instead:

- Opponent delegates → mediator plays A1 (only 1 delegator)
- You play A1, opponent plays A1 → you get 3 points

3 > 0, but 3 < 5 → worse than 5

So deviating gives you **3 or 0**, both < 5

So **no incentive to deviate**

Thus, **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium** giving each player 5 points.

**Perfect!**

---

#### What about other equilibria?

Suppose both players play A0 with probability 1.

Then both play A0 → both get 5 → also good.

But is it stable?

Suppose you deviate to delegate: play A2.

Then:
- Opponent plays A0
- You delegate → 1 delegator → mediator plays A1
- You play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 3
- vs 5 → worse

So no incentive to deviate.

But now, if **one player deviates to A2** while the other plays A0, the deviator gets 3, worse than 5.

So (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But (A2, A2) is also a Nash equilibrium, and gives same payoff (5).

Now, is (A1, A1) a Nash equilibrium?

Yes: both get 3.

But if you deviate to A2, then:
- Opponent plays A1
- You delegate → only 1 delegator → mediator plays A1
- So you play A1, opponent plays A1 → you get 3
- Same as before

So **indifferent**

But if you deviate to A0: you play A0, opponent A1 → you get 0 → worse

So (A1, A1) is Nash, but inefficient.

But (A2, A2) and (A0, A0) are both better.

Now, **why would players choose (A2, A2) instead of (A0, A0)?**

Because **delegation makes coordination easier**: you don’t need to coordinate on a choice — the mediator just does it.

But more importantly, in **(A0, A0)**, if one player miscoordinates, they get 0.

But in **(A2, A2)**, **both are guaranteed to get 5**, **as long as both delegate**.

And we just saw that **no player has incentive to deviate**.

So (A2, A2) is a **stable, efficient equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 8: Is there any reason not to play (A2, A2)?**

Suppose the other player plays A0.

You consider playing A2: you delegate → only 1 delegator → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1.

Opponent plays A0 → so you get 3 points.

But if you played A0, you’d get 5.

So **if the other player plays A0**, you would get less by delegating (3 vs 5).

So **delegation is bad if the other player doesn't delegate**.

Hence, delegation is only safe **if both delegate**.

So in equilibrium, both playing A2 is safe.

But if you think the other player might not delegate, you’re worse off.

But in a **symmetric equilibrium**, each player expects the other to play A2.

So **(A2, A2)** is **only stable if both commit to it**.

But in this game, **you are the one choosing your strategy** — you can commit.

And you know that **(A2, A2)** gives 5, and is a Nash equilibrium.

Now, could a mixed strategy be better?

Suppose you mix between A0 and A2.

Let’s suppose the opponent plays A2 with high probability.

But let’s go back.

We want to **maximize your payoff**.

Given that (A2, A2) leads to 5 points and is equilibrium, and deviating gives less, **this is optimal**.

But is there a **better outcome**?

Maximum possible payoff is 5 (when both play A0).

(A2, A2) achieves that.

Any other strategy that doesn’t lead to coordination on A0 will risk getting less.

But can we do better than 5? No — maximum is 5.

So 5 is best possible.

Now, consider other strategies.

Suppose you play A0 with 100%.  
Then if opponent plays A0 → you get 5  
But if opponent plays A1 → you get 0

So your expected payoff depends on opponent's strategy.

But if opponent uses A2, you get only 3, as above.

So unless you expect opponent to play A0 with high probability, A0 is risky.

Similarly, if you play A1, you get at least 3, but never 5.

So A1 is safe but not optimal.

But delegation gives you **a way to guarantee 5**, **if both delegate**.

And **(A2, A2)** is an equilibrium.

Moreover, no player can do better by deviating.

So **playing A2 with probability 1** is **safe and optimal**.

---

### **Step 9: What about mixed strategies with delegation?**

Suppose you play A2 with probability r < 1.

Then:
- With probability r, you delegate (and if opponent delegates, you get 5; if opponent doesn’t, you get 3 or 0 depending)
- With probability 1−r, you play A0 or A1

But unless the opponent is also delegating with high probability, you’re risking low payoffs.

But to be safe, you’d need to assume opponent is playing A2 too.

But if opponent is playing A2 with probability 1, then:
- You play A2 → you get 5 (since both delegate → mediator A0)
- You play A0 → opponent delegates → mediator plays A1 → you play A0 vs A1 → you get 0
- You play A1 → you play A1 vs A1 → you get 3

So **A2 is strictly better** than A0 or A1.

So **if opponent is playing A2 with 100%**, your best response is A2.

Similarly, if you play A2, and opponent plays A2, you get 5.

So mutual delegation is **dominant strategy** in that context.

Thus, **playing A2 with 100%** is optimal when expecting opponent to do the same.

But what if the opponent might not?

Suppose you play A2 with high probability, but opponent might play A0.

Then:
- If you delegate (A2) and they play A0 → mediator plays A1 (only 1 delegator) → you play A1 vs A0 → you get 3

But if you had played A0 yourself, you’d get 5.

So you lose.

So delegation is **riskier** if the opponent doesn’t delegate.

But in equilibrium, **both players have incentive to delegate**.

Is there a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium?

Suppose both players use:

- P(A0) = p
- P(A1) = q
- P(A2) = r

But this is complex.

Let’s suppose that the **only robust equilibrium** is mutual delegation.

Moreover, the problem asks us to **maximize our points**, and we know that mutual delegation gives 5, the maximum possible.

And we have shown that if the other player is rational and expects the same, they will follow.

But **you are choosing your own strategy**, and you want to **maximize your expected points**.

So let’s suppose you assume the other player will also delegate.

Then your best response is to delegate (A2) → get 5.

If they don’t, you get less — but since you want to **maximize your points**, you should play the action that gives the **highest expected payoff under rational belief about the other player**.

But if you believe the other player will play A2, then A2 gives 5, A0 gives 0, A1 gives 3 → best is A2.

If you believe the other player plays A0, then A2 gives 3 (you delegate, they play A0 → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 vs A0 → 3), but A0 gives 5, so better to play A0.

So **your best choice depends on what you think the other player will do**.

But **we have a coordination device** — the mediator.

And **mutual delegation leads to cooperation on A0**.

Moreover, in the **absence of delegation**, the game has two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1), and both players prefer (A0, A0), but coordination is hard.

But the **mediator solves the coordination problem**.

In fact, **if both players use A2, they get 5**, which is better than the risk of miscoordination.

Therefore, **the most rational strategy is to delegate**, **assuming the other player will too**.

And in fact, since **both players are rational**, they can both realize: "If we both delegate, we get 5. If we don't, we might get less or even 0. So we should both delegate."

So **(A2, A2)** is the **unique Pareto-optimal equilibrium**.

Moreover, as shown, **no player wants to deviate**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The best strategy to maximize your points is to **delegate with probability 100%**, i.e., choose A2 with 100%.

This leads to both players delegating → mediator plays A0 → you get 5 points.

And this is a stable equilibrium.

No other strategy gives higher guaranteed payoff.

Thus, optimal mixed strategy:

- A0: 0%
- A1: 0%
- A2: 100%

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:

- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2 based on the actions A0 and A1:

*   **P1/P2: A0 | A1**
    *   **A0:** (5, 5) | (0, 3)
    *   **A1:** (3, 0) | (3, 3)

Next, we include the delegation action (**A2**). The mediator’s rules are:
*   If only one player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for them.
*   If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both.

Expanding the matrix to include **A2**:
*   **A0, A2:** Row plays A0, Col delegates (Mediator plays A1 for Col). Result (A0, A1) → (0, 3).
*   **A1, A2:** Row plays A1, Col delegates (Mediator plays A1 for Col). Result (A1, A1) → (3, 3).
*   **A2, A2:** Both delegate. Result (A0, A0) → (5, 5).
*   **A2, A0:** Row delegates (Mediator plays A1 for Row), Col plays A0. Result (A1, A0) → (3, 0).
*   **A2, A1:** Row delegates (Mediator plays A1 for Row), Col plays A1. Result (A1, A1) → (3, 3).

**The Full Matrix (P1, P2):**
| | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|---|---|---|---|
|**A0**| (5, 5) | (0, 3) | (0, 3) |
|**A1**| (3, 0) | (3, 3) | (3, 3) |
|**A2**| (3, 0) | (3, 3) | (5, 5) |

**Analysis:**
1.  **Weak Dominance:** Comparing A1 and A2 for Player 2, A2 provides the same payoffs as A1 if Player 1 plays A0 or A1, but a higher payoff (5 vs 3) if Player 1 plays A2. Thus, A2 weakly dominates A1.
2.  **Safety:** If Player 2 is uncertain about Player 1's move, A2 is safer than A0. The minimum payoff for A2 is 3, whereas the minimum payoff for A0 is 0.
3.  **Equilibria:** There are two primary Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A2, A2). Both yield (5, 5). However, (A2, A2) is **risk-dominant**. In a coordination game, the risk-dominant equilibrium is the one that is more robust to the other player's uncertainty. If Player 1 deviates from A2 to A0, Player 2 still gets 3. If Player 1 deviates from A0 to A2, Player 2 gets 0.

Because A2 weakly dominates A1 and provides a safer path to the maximum payoff of 5 (via the risk-dominant equilibrium), delegating to the mediator is the most rational strategy.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix
As Player 2, my payoffs are:
```
              P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0          5         0
P2: A1          3         3
```

## Step 2: Analyze the Mediator Option
The mediator plays A0 regardless of whether 1 or 2 players delegate to it. This means:
- **Delegating (A2) is strategically equivalent to playing A0**
- If I delegate, the mediator commits me to action A0

## Step 3: Find the Nash Equilibrium of the Base Game
For Player 2 (me):
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me 3 → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives me 0, A1 gives me 3 → prefer A1

Let p = probability P1 plays A0 (or delegates)

My expected payoff from A0 (or delegation): 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
My expected payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

For mixing equilibrium: 5p = 3 → **p = 0.6**

By symmetry, I should play A0 (or delegate) with probability **0.6** and A1 with probability **0.4**.

## Step 4: Allocate Between A0 and A2
Since delegation and playing A0 directly are strategically equivalent (both result in playing A0), I need to split the 0.6 probability between them.

**Key consideration:** Delegating to the mediator is a form of commitment that makes my choice of A0 more credible and transparent. This could facilitate coordination toward the mutually beneficial (5,5) outcome. Therefore, I'll put the full 0.6 on delegation rather than direct play.

## Step 5: Calculate Final Distribution
- A0: 0% (no direct play of A0)
- A1: 40% (Nash equilibrium requires 40% probability of A1)
- A2: 60% (delegate to mediator, which plays A0)

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 40, "A2": 60}

M1 plays A1 if 1 player delegates, A0 if 2 players delegate.

**Scenarios:**
- Both delegate → M1 plays (A0, A0) → I get 5 ✓
- Only P1 delegates → M1 plays A1 for P1, my best response is A1 → (A1, A1) → I get 3
- Only I delegate → M1 plays A1 for me, P1's best response is A1 → (A1, A1) → I get 3  
- Neither delegates → base game uncertainty

M1 creates strong incentives for mutual delegation (5 vs 3), but punishes unilateral delegation.

## Analyzing M2 (My proposal)

M2 always plays A0 regardless of how many players delegate.

**Scenarios:**
- Both delegate → M2 plays (A0, A0) → I get 5 ✓
- Only P1 delegates → M2 plays A0 for P1, my best response is A0 → I get 5 ✓
- Only I delegate → M2 plays A0 for me, P1's best response is A0 (5 > 3) → I get 5 ✓
- Neither delegates → base game

M2 guarantees the cooperative outcome (5, 5) as long as at least one player delegates, and makes A0 the best response even when playing independently.

## Comparison

M2 is strictly better than M1:
- Both achieve (5, 5) with mutual delegation
- M2 achieves (5, 5) with unilateral delegation, while M1 only gives (3, 3)
- M2 is more robust and forgiving

## Strategic Voting

To maximize the probability M2 is selected, I should approve only M2. If I approve both and P1 approves only M1, then M1 wins with 2 votes. If I approve only M2, the worst case is a tie.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)**

We are Player 2 in a symmetric game where both players choose between A0 and A1, and the payoffs are:

| Your Action | Other's Action | Your Points | Other's Points |
|------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| A0         | A0             | 5           | 5              |
| A0         | A1             | 0           | 3              |
| A1         | A0             | 3           | 0              |
| A1         | A1             | 3           | 3              |

This is a **coordination game with a preference for A0**, but with a twist:

- If both play A0 → both get 5 (best outcome).
- If you play A0 and the other plays A1 → you get 0 (bad).
- If you play A1 and the other plays A0 → you get 3 (better than 0).
- If both play A1 → both get 3.

So A0 is better than A1 when the other plays A0, but if the other plays A1, then playing A1 is better than playing A0 (3 > 0).

Thus, this game has **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1), and possibly a mixed equilibrium.

But note: (A0, A0) gives both players 5 — this is the **Pareto-optimal outcome**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the delegation mechanism**

We are allowed to **delegate** our move to a mediator, but **only if we approve the mediator**.

In the **approval voting stage**, we vote on which mediators to approve. Then, the **winning mediator** is chosen uniformly at random **from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

After that, **we can choose to delegate or not**. But for now, we’re only asked to **approve or disapprove mediators**.

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate the two mediators**

**Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):**

- If **1 player** delegates to it → plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate to it → plays A0

**Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):**

- If **1 player** delegates to it → plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate to it → plays A0

→ **M1 and M2 are identical in behavior.**

So both mediators behave the same way:
- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

So their strategic impact is **identical**.

Since they are identical in behavior, **we can only distinguish them by other factors**, such as:
- Whose proposal they are
- Possible coordination implications

But **the game says nothing about bias or incentives** of the proposers — just that **the winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with the most approvals**.

So the only difference between M1 and M2 is **who proposed them**.

But since both work the same way, and we are a rational player seeking to **maximize our own points**, we should **approve both**, unless there’s a downside.

---

### **Step 4: Why would we disapprove of a mediator?**

We should disapprove **only if** approving it reduces our expected payoff, due to how the delegation mechanism works.

Let’s consider:

- If we approve **only one** mediator (say M1), and the other player also approves M1, then M1 gets 2 approvals → wins (since it’s the max).
- If we approve both M1 and M2, and the other player approves both, then both get 2 approvals → both tied → one chosen at random.
- If we approve both and the other approves only M1, then M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

Thus, **approving both mediators increases the chance that one of them wins**, but only if the number of approvals among mediators is balanced.

But since **both mediators behave identically**, it doesn’t matter which one wins.

Therefore, **approving both M1 and M2** gives us more flexibility, and **does not reduce our control** — it can only **increase** our chances of the mediator we want (which is indistinguishable from the other).

But wait: **do we benefit from having more approval options?**

Let’s think strategically.

Suppose the other player is also rational and wants to maximize their points.

They might prefer a different delegation outcome.

But **the median is identical in behavior**, so no matter which one wins, the outcome is the same.

So **we don’t care which mediator wins**, as long as **one of them wins**.

But if we approve **only one**, say M1, and the other player also approves M1, then M1 wins → mediator plays based on number of delegates.

Now, suppose we **both delegate** to the mediator → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0.

But suppose we **only approve M1**, and the other player approves M2 → then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 1 → both tied → one chosen at random → 50% chance M1 wins, 50% M2 → same outcome.

But if we approve both, and the other player approves only M1, then M1 gets 2, M2 gets 1 → M1 wins for sure.

Similarly, if the other player approves both, we tie with both → winner random → still fair.

Now, **are we better off by approving both**?

Let’s suppose that **we want to coordinate on the mediator playing A0** when both delegate, because:

- If both delegate → mediator plays A0 → then we both get A0 → we get 5  
- If only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → we get A1

But recall:
- If you delegate, **you don’t get to choose your action** — the mediator chooses.
- If you delegate, and the mediator plays A1, then **you get the points from A1**, regardless of what you wanted.

So if both delegate, then both actions are A0 → we get 5 each → **best possible outcome**.

If only one delegates, then that player gets A1, the other can do whatever.

But if I delegate, and only one delegates, I pass control to the mediator → which gives me A1.

So **I prefer to delegate if I expect that the other will also delegate**, because that gives me A0.

But if I delegate and the other doesn’t, then I get A1 → which is worse than A0 → and only 3 points.

But I can choose not to delegate.

So let’s think about **the incentives**.

Suppose **both players foresee that if both delegate**, the mediator plays A0 → both get 5.

So both have an incentive to **both delegate**, **if they can trust the mediator to coordinate**.

But can they?

Suppose I delegate → mediator plays A1 if only one delegates, A0 if two.

So if I delegate and the other doesn’t → I get A1 (3 points).

If I don’t delegate, I can choose A0 or A1.

But if the other delegates, and I don’t → then the other gets A1 (if only one delegate), and I can choose my action.

Wait — this is complex.

Let’s model a **delegation game**.

But here’s the key: **we are only deciding which mediators to approve**, **before** the actual delegation decisions.

So our strategy is:

- Approve M1? M2?
- Then, in the next stage, decide whether to delegate to the winning mediator.

But since the winning mediator is chosen at random from those with the most approvals, and since M1 and M2 are identical, **approving both increases the chance that the mediator exists and is selected**, but doesn’t change what it does.

Moreover, **approving both gives us more residual power** — even if we approve only one, it might not win if the other player approves differently.

But again, **since both mediators do the same thing**, we gain **no advantage from not approving one of them**, unless there is a cost.

Is there any cost to approving a mediator?

No. The only cost is **if approving a mediator leads to a worse outcome**.

But since both mediators are identical in behavior, approving either one gives the **same potential outcomes**.

Therefore, **approving both cannot hurt us**.

And it might **help**:

- If the other player approves only one mediator (say M1), and we approve both → then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → M1 wins → the mediator exists.
- If we approve only M1, and they approve only M1 → M1 wins.
- But if we approve only M1, and they approve only M2 → then M1:1, M2:1 → tied → **winner chosen at random** → so 50% chance M1 wins, 50% M2 → but since both are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But **if I approve only M1**, and they approve only M2, then **I have no way to ensure that a mediator of my choice is selected** — but again, since both do the same thing, it doesn't matter.

So in **all cases**, **approving both mediators is at least as good as approving only one**.

- It does not increase risk (since behavior is same).
- It ensures that **even if the other player approves the other one, we still have a mediator in the running**.
- It increases the chance that at least one mediator wins (since more meditators can win).

But crucially: **approving both mediators does not reduce our options** — it **maximizes** the chance that **a mediator exists** and that we can later choose to delegate to it.

Moreover, **if we disapprove one**, we’re restricting our own future choices.

So **rational self-interest says: approve both**.

Even if one mediator is proposed by a different player, since they behave identically, it doesn’t matter.

Hence, **we should approve both M1 and M2**.

---

### **Final Decision**

We approve both mediators, because:
- They are strategically identical.
- Approving both increases the chance that a mediator is selected.
- It does not reduce our ability to coordinate or achieve good outcomes.
- It gives us more flexibility in the delegation phase.

response:
Delegating (A2) has an important property here:

- If **only you** delegate, the mediator plays **A1** for you, which guarantees you **3 points** regardless of what the other player does.
- If **both** players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both, giving you **5 points**.
- Compared to playing **A1 directly**, delegating (A2) is **never worse** and sometimes better (when both delegate). So putting probability on A1 doesn’t help.

Meanwhile, playing **A0** yourself can give **5** if the other plays A0, but risks **0** if the other delegates (since they’d effectively play A1).

So to maximize expected points without reliable coordination—and to both secure at least 3 and create a chance at 5 if the other also delegates—the best choice is to delegate with full probability.

response:
The mediator changes the game because **delegating (A2)** makes your eventual action depend on whether the *other player also delegates*:

- If **only you** delegate: mediator plays **A1** for you → you get **3 points** no matter what the other player does (since A1 vs A0 gives 3, and A1 vs A1 gives 3).
- If **both** delegate: mediator plays **A0** for both → you get **5 points**.

So compared to playing **A1 directly**, delegating is **never worse** and sometimes better:
- A1 always yields 3.
- A2 yields 3, and becomes 5 if the other player also delegates.

Also, if the other player delegates, **deviating away from A2 is bad**:
- If they play A2 and you play A0 → they become A1 (since they’re the only delegator), so you get **0**.
- If they play A2 and you play A1 → you get **3**.
- If you also play A2 → you get **5**.

Thus, **(A2, A2)** is a stable (strict) equilibrium giving you the maximum available payoff (5), so the best choice is to delegate with probability 1.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand my payoffs as Player 2

From the payoff matrix:
- A0 vs opponent's A0: 5 points
- A0 vs opponent's A1: 0 points  
- A1 vs opponent's A0: 3 points
- A1 vs opponent's A1: 3 points

## Step 2: Analyze the mediator option

If I delegate (A2):
- If only I delegate (opponent doesn't): Mediator plays A1 for me
- If both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both of us

## Step 3: Calculate expected payoffs for each action

Let's say opponent uses probabilities (p0, p1, p2) for (A0, A1, A2).

**If I play A0:**
- Expected payoff = 5×p0 + 0×p1 + 0×p2 = 5p0

**If I play A1:**  
- Expected payoff = 3×p0 + 3×p1 + 3×p2 = 3

**If I delegate (A2):**
- vs opponent's A0: (only I delegate → I play A1 → I get 3)
- vs opponent's A1: (only I delegate → I play A1 → I get 3)  
- vs opponent's A2: (both delegate → both play A0 → I get 5)
- Expected payoff = 3×p0 + 3×p1 + 5×p2 = 3 + 2p2

## Step 4: Identify the key equilibrium

Notice that if **both players delegate**:
- Both get A0 from the mediator
- Outcome is (A0, A0) → both get 5 points
- This is the best mutual outcome!

Let me check if this is a Nash equilibrium:
- If opponent delegates (p2=1), my payoffs are:
  - A0: 0 (they play A1)
  - A1: 3 (they play A1)
  - A2: 5 (both get A0)
  
Delegating gives me 5, which is better than any deviation. By symmetry, the opponent has no incentive to deviate either.

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning

Player 1 proposed this mediator because it creates a coordination mechanism:
- The mediator is designed so that mutual delegation yields (A0, A0) = (5, 5)
- This is better than other equilibria (e.g., both playing A1 gives 3,3)
- The mediator serves as a commitment device to achieve cooperation

Since both delegating is a Nash equilibrium that gives the maximum payoff (5 points), this is the optimal strategy.

- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's go through this step by step to determine the best strategy for **Player 2** (you) in this decision-making game.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)

The base game is a symmetric two-player game with the following payoff matrix (Player 2's payoffs in each cell):

|               | P1 A0       | P1 A1       |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **P2 A0**     | 5           | 0           |
| **P2 A1**     | 3           | 3           |

Let’s denote:
- P2 chooses A0 with probability `p`
- P1 chooses A0 with probability `q`

We can compute P2’s expected payoff:

- If P2 plays A0:  
  `E = q * 5 + (1 - q) * 0 = 5q`

- If P2 plays A1:  
  `E = q * 3 + (1 - q) * 3 = 3`

So P2 is indifferent when `5q = 3 → q = 0.6`

Thus, **if both players act independently**, the symmetric Nash equilibrium involves each playing A0 with probability 0.6 and A1 with 0.4. But **we are not restricted to this** — we can *delegate*.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism

There is a **mediator** that can be **delegated to**. You have a new action: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.

Even though the mediator was proposed by Player 1, **both players can choose to delegate** to it. The mediator acts based on **how many players have delegated**:

- If **1 player** delegates → Mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → Mediator plays **A0**

So:
- If only you delegate → mediator plays A1 for you.
- If both you and the other player delegate → mediator plays A0 for you.

Note: The mediator is not strategic — it just follows the rule based on the number of delegates.

You are **Player 2**, and you choose your strategy including whether to delegate or not.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Implications of Delegation

Let’s consider the possible combinations of choices (yours and Player 1’s), and what happens.

Let’s denote:
- Your action: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)
- Player 1's action: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)

But since delege is a joint decision based on how many delegate, we can model:

#### Case 1: You delegate (A2), Player 1 does **not** delegate

- Mediator plays A1 (since 1 delegate)
- So you play A1
- Player 1 plays their own action (A0 or A1)

So your payoff depends on what Player 1 chooses:
- If P1 plays A0: you get 3 (you play A1, P1 plays A0)
- If P1 plays A1: you get 3 (both play A1)

So **no matter what Player 1 does**, if **only you delegate**, you get **3 points**.

#### Case 2: You do **not** delegate, Player 1 delegates (A2)

- Mediator plays A1 (1 delegate)
- So Player 1 plays A1
- You choose A0 or A1

So:
- If you play A0: you get 0 (you A0, P1 A1)
- If you play A1: you get 3 (both A1)

So your best response is to play A1 → get 3.

Thus, if **only Player 1 delegates**, and you act normally, you can still get 3.

#### Case 3: Both delegate (A2)

- Mediator plays A0 (2 delegates)
- So you play A0
- Player 1 plays A0

→ You get **5** points (A0 vs A0)

#### Case 4: Neither delegates

- You and Player 1 both play A0 or A1 based on your own strategies

→ Same as base game.

---

### Step 4: Compare Outcomes Across Scenarios

Let’s summarize your payoff in each case:

| Your Action | P1 Action | Result (your payoff) |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0        | 5                      |
| A0          | A1        | 0                      |
| A1          | A0        | 3                      |
| A1          | A1        | 3                      |
| A2 (delegate) | not A2    | 3 (since you play A1) |
| not A2      | A2 (delegate) | 3 (if you play A1)    |
| A2          | A2        | 5 (you play A0)        |

Note: When **only one person delegates**, you get 3 no matter what.

When **both delegate**, you get 5.

When **neither delegates**, you can get 5, 3, or 0 depending on both choices.

So delegating **guarantees**:
- 3 points if only you delegate,
- 5 points if both delegate.

But if you don’t delegate and the other does, you can still get 3 (by playing A1), or less (if you play A0).

---

### Step 5: Strategic Considerations

Player 1 is likely to act rationally too. But note: **You do not know their strategy**; you must choose your own mixed strategy to maximize your expected payoff *assuming Player 1 is also rational*.

However, you are allowed to model what Player 1 might do.

Let’s consider the **Nash equilibrium in this extended game**, including delegation.

But first, observe:

- **If both players delegate**, you both get 5 → better than the base game’s 3-5 expected value.
- In the base game, the equilibrium gives each player expected payoff of:

From earlier: at q = 0.6 (P1 plays A0 with 0.6), P2’s expected payoff is:
- E = 0.6 * 5 + 0.4 * 3 = 3 + 1.2 = 4.2

So base game gives **4.2** expected payoff.

But if you can **both commit to delegate**, you get **5 each**, which is strictly better.

So if **you could coordinate** to both delegate, that would be desirable.

But is it stable?

Suppose you delegate and expect Player 1 to delegate → you get 5.

Can Player 1 deviate and get more?

If only you delegate (you play A1), and Player 1 switches to **not delegating**, and plays A0:
- You play A1 (delegate)
- Player 1 plays A0
- You get 3, Player 1 gets 0 → Player 1 does worse.

If Player 1 chooses to **not delegate** and plays A1 instead:
- You play A1, P1 plays A1 → both get 3 → Player 1 gets 3 < 5 → worse.

So Player 1 has **no incentive** to deviate if both delegate.

Similarly, you have no incentive to deviate: if both delegate, you get 5. If you stop delegating and play A0 while P1 delegates:
- You play A0, P1 plays A1 → you get 0
- Worse than 5.

If you play A1: you get 3 < 5.

So **both delegating is a Nash equilibrium** — each gets 5.

Now, is there any incentive to not commit?

But wait — **you can't force Player 1 to delegate** — you must choose your own strategy.

So if you **randomize**, you might give Player 1 incentives to act differently.

Let’s suppose you **randomly delegate**.

Can you do better than 5?

No. 5 is already the highest possible payoff in any state.

But in the **both-delegate** equilibrium, you get 5.

In **only-you-delegate**, you get 3.

In **only-P1-delegates**, you can get 3 (if you play A1).

But if you **don’t delegate**, and P1 does not delegate, you might get more or less.

But suppose Player 1 is **also rational**, and knows this.

Then Player 1 might **also want to delegate**, because if **you are likely to delegate**, then Player 1 can get 5 by delegating too, or only 3 by not delegating.

Let’s suppose Player 1 thinks: “If I don’t delegate, I get at most 3 (if I play A1), but if I delegate and you do too, I get 5.”

So Player 1 would want to **delegate** if they believe you will delegate.

Thus, if you **commit to delegate** (i.e., play A2 with 100%), then **Player 1 has no reason not to delegate**.

So if you **always delegate**, Player 1’s best response is to also delegate → you both get 5.

If you **never delegate**, then Player 1 can get 3 (by playing A1), or maybe 5 (if they play A0 and you do too), but in equilibrium, it's stable around 4.2.

But **5 is better than 4.2**.

So **the best outcome for you is to delegate unconditionally**.

But wait: what if Player 1 **does not** delegate even if you do?

Then:
- You delegate → mediator plays A1
- Player 1 plays A0 → you get 3
- Player 1 gets 0 → he has no incentive to do that.

If Player 1 plays A1 → you both get 3.

So Player 1 would prefer to delegate (and get 5) than to not delegate and get only 3 or 0.

So **Player 1 has a strict incentive to delegate if you do**.

Therefore:
- If **you delegate (A2 = 100%)**, then **Player 1 will best respond by also delegating** → you both get 5.

So **you can **guarantee** 5 points by delegating with probability 100%.

Is there any benefit to not delegating?

Suppose you delegate with probability 99%, and play A1 with 1%.

That means:
- With 99% chance: you delegate → Player 1 will respond by delegating (best response) → you get 5
- With 1% chance: you play A1 (no delegation), so Player 1 might not delegate

But in the 1% case, if you play A1 and Player 1 does not delegate:
- You get 3 (if P1 plays A0 or A1), but P1’s best response is to play A1 → you get 3

So you get 3, not 5.

So expected payoff = 0.99 × 5 + 0.01 × 3 = 4.95 + 0.03 = **4.98 < 5**

Thus, **worse** than 100% delegation.

Similarly, if you ever deviate from delegation, you risk getting only 3, but never more than 5.

And the only way to get 5 is to have **both delegate**.

If you don’t delegate, you can’t *force* Player 1 to delegate.

But **if you delegate, Player 1 has strong incentive to do so**.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to **always delegate**, so that both of you delegate and you get 5.

Moreover, this is a **dominant strategy** in effect: **delegating guarantees a better outcome than not**, depending on how Player 1 responds.

Even more strongly: **Delegating is a best response to any belief about Player 1’s action where Player 1 is rational.**

But compactly: **The only way to guarantee 5 is to delegate**, and if you do, Player 1 will match it.

If you don’t delegate, you are at risk of getting only 3 or 0.

So to **maximize expected payoff**, you should **always delegate**.

Even better: the **both-delegate** outcome is a Nash equilibrium, and it gives you 5.

No other equilibrium gives you more.

So you should choose **A2 = 100%**, and A0 = 0%, A1 = 0%

---

### Step 6: Final Strategy

- Probability of A0: 0%
- Probability of A1: 0%
- Probability of A2 (Delegate): 100%

This maximizes your expected payoff at 5, and is supported by Nash equilibrium reasoning.

response:
To determine which mediators to approve, we first need to analyze the different outcomes of delegating or not delegating to these mediators based on their proposed designs and the payoff structure of the game. Let's summarize the key points and then make a decision.

### Understanding the Mediators:
Both proposed mediators operate under the same rules, which makes our decision relatively straightforward:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator plays action A1.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays action A0.

### Payoffs Analysis:
Let's analyze each scenario's payoffs considering how mediators work:

#### Case 1: Both Players Delegate to the Mediator
- Both mediators will play A0.
- Payoffs:
  - Player 1: 5 points
  - Player 2: 5 points

#### Case 2: Only One Player Delegates to the Mediator
- The mediator will play A1 for the player who delegates.
- Payoffs will vary depending on the independent player's choice:
  - If the other player independently chooses A0:
    - Delegating Player: 3 points
    - Independent Player: 0 points
  - If the other player independently chooses A1:
    - Delegating Player: 3 points
    - Independent Player: 3 points

To maximize our expected payoff, we should aim for scenarios with the highest payoffs given the mediator's behavior.

### Strategic Decision-Making:
Given that both players would receive 5 points if they both delegate, this is the most cooperative and beneficial outcome.

1. **Approving both Mediators:**
   - If both mediators are approved and chosen, we will likely end up in a cooperative scenario where both players delegate, leading to each receiving 5 points.
   - Regardless of which mediator is chosen, both mediators have identical rules which ensure both players opting for delegation results in a mutual and optimal outcome.

Based on this analysis, it would be advantageous to approve both mediators to ensure an outcome where mutual delegation is possible, leading to maximum points for both players.

### Final Decision:
We shall approve both mediators to ensure the possibility of optimal play resulting in mutual delegation and maximum points.

response:
To decide which mediators to approve, let's evaluate the game dynamics and the implications of each mediator design:

1. **Game Without Mediators**:
   - If both players choose actions probabilistically:
     - Pure A0 by both players gives each 5 points per round.
     - Mixed strategies complicate the expected values but can risk non-optimal outcomes.
   - Safe choice balances between earning points and not being exploited.

2. **Mediator Dynamics**:
   - Understanding mediator rules is key:
     - **Mediator M1** (Player 1 proposed):
       - 1 delegator: plays A1.
       - 2 delegators: plays A0.
     - **Mediator M2** (Player 2 proposed):
       - 1 delegator: plays A1.
       - 2 delegators: plays A0.

**Analysis of Mediator Behavior**:
- Both proposed mediators function identically, making the risk and outcomes dependent on the choice of delegation.
- If I alone delegate (1 delegator), mediator plays A1:
  - If Player 2 independently plays A0: I get 3 points, Player 2 gets 0.
  - If Player 2 independently plays A1: both get 3 points.
- If both delegate (2 delegators), mediator plays A0:
  - Both get 5 points assuming it's like playing A0 directly for both.

**Strategy Decision**:
- Given identical functioning mediators:
  - Either mediator plays optimally under delegation where mutual delegation guarantees the most stable payoff (5 points each).
  - It simplifies the decision-making process by reducing direct gameplay to a coordination problem.

**Approval Decision**:
- Both mediators are beneficial under coordinated delegation, where 5 points each is a stable and high payoff.
- With both functioning identically, their approval should principled reduce complexity and promote mutual trust.

Here's the final JSON object:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

This approval decision supports either mediator equally, maximizing potential points through guaranteed cooperation if delegation is mutually agreed upon.

response:
Let's analyze the game and the mediators proposed step by step:

### Payoff Matrix
First, we need to look at the given payoffs for each combination of actions chosen by you (Player 1) and the other player (Player 2).

|         | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **P1 A0** | P1: 5, P2: 5 | P1: 0, P2: 3 |
| **P1 A1** | P1: 3, P2: 0 | P1: 3, P2: 3 |

### Mediator Strategy Analysis
Let's examine the strategies proposed by the mediators:

#### Mediator Proposed by Player 1
- If 1 player delegates, it will play action A1.
- If 2 players delegate, it will play action A0.

#### Mediator Proposed by Player 2
- If 1 player delegates, it will play action A1.
- If 2 players delegate, it will play action A0.

Interestingly, both proposed mediators have the same strategy.

### Analyzing The Mediator Strategy
When 1 player delegates:
- The mediator will choose A1, regardless of who delegates.

When 2 players delegate:
- Both players will receive 5 points each if both delegate because the mediator will choose A0 for both, resulting in (A0, A0) → (5, 5).

### Decision Analysis
1. **If neither player delegates**: Both players must independently choose probabilities for A0 and A1 to maximize their expected utility. The Nash equilibrium analysis for this payoff matrix suggests non-cooperative behavior leading to the potential for (A1, A1) → (3, 3).

2. **If both players delegate**: Both players get the highest collective payoff of (5, 5).

### Strategy Recommendation
Given that both mediators ensure (5, 5) if both players delegate, and both mediators have the same rules, approving either mediator will lead to the potential for the best possible outcome. Thus, I should approve both.

### Final Decision
Since both mediators are identical, and their approval will lead to the highest possible outcome when both delegate, it makes sense to approve both mediators.

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

This ensures that:
- Regardless of which mediator is selected, the optimal decision to delegate will result in the highest possible collective points of 5 each.
- Both mediators being selected gives uniform approval, maintaining fairness.

On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:

response:
To choose which mediator(s) to approve, let's break down the decision-making process step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Mediators
Both mediators proposed are identical in their functional behavior:
- **If 1 player delegates to the mediator, it will play action A1.**
- **If 2 players delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.**

### Step 2: Evaluate Independent Play
Now, let's evaluate the payoffs based on the independent play strategies:
- If both players independently choose A0 with certainty, they both get 5 points (5, 5).
- If both players independently choose A1 with certainty, they both get 3 points (3, 3).
- If cooperating pays more: (A0, A0) is superior (5, 5) to (A1, A1) (3, 3).

### Step 3: Evaluating Mediator Delegation
#### Single Delegation:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator will choose A1. If I delegate and the other player doesn't, the outcomes vary. Assuming the other player chooses A0 or A1 independently:
  - Other chooses A0 → (3, 0) in my favor.
  - Other chooses A1 → (3, 3) in balance but less than A0-A0.

#### Double Delegation:
- If both players delegate, the mediator will choose A0 for both → (5, 5).

### Step 4: Consider Best Strategies Based on Mediators
For both mediators, the delegation dynamics are:
- If only one player delegates: compared to not delegating, may result in potentially less favorable unilateral gains.
- If both players delegate: follows a cooperative strategy (A0), yielding (5, 5), which is the optimal collective payoff.

### Step 5: Decision on Approval
Given:
- Both mediators are identical and favor mutual cooperation when used by both players.
- Enabling mediator could drive towards the optimal (A0, A0) payoff if mutual trust is assumed.

### Conclusion and JSON Output
Since both mediators will drive cooperative play resulting in the best (5, 5) outcome if both players delegate:
```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```
This output suggests approving both mediators because their behavior incentivizes cooperation for maximum mutual points.

response:
To determine the best approach to this decision-making game and decide which mediators I should approve of, I will break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Game Dynamics and Payoff Matrix

- If both players choose A0, each gets 5 points.
- If I (Player 2) choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1, I get 0 points and Player 1 gets 3 points.
- If I choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0, I get 3 points and Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If both players choose A1, each gets 3 points.

### Step 2: Analyze Mediator Designs

1. **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
    - If 1 player delegates: plays A1
    - If 2 players delegate: plays A0

2. **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
    - If 1 player delegates: plays A0
    - If 2 players delegate: plays A0

### Step 3: Assess Each Mediator's Impact on My Payoff

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **If I delegate alone (1 player):** The mediator plays A1.
    - If Player 1 plays A0: I get 3 points.
    - If Player 1 plays A1: I get 3 points.

- **If we both delegate (2 players):** The mediator plays A0.
    - Both get 5 points (highest mutual payoff).

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- **If I delegate alone (1 player):** The mediator plays A0.
    - If Player 1 plays A0: Both get 5 points.
    - If Player 1 plays A1: I get 0 points.

- **If we both delegate (2 players):** The mediator plays A0.
    - Both get 5 points (highest mutual payoff).

### Step 4: Determine Strategies and Mutual Benefit

- **Mediator 1 (Player 1's proposal):**
    - Non-cooperative scenario (one delegate): Playing A1 guarantees at least 3 points regardless of Player 1's choice.
    - Cooperative scenario (both delegate): Playing A0 guarantees 5 points for both.

- **Mediator 2 (Player 2's proposal):**
    - Non-cooperative scenario (one delegate): Playing A0 risks getting 0 points if Player 1 plays A1.
    - Cooperative scenario (both delegate): Playing A0 guarantees 5 points for both.

### Step 5: Decision Making

Given that Mediator 2 proposes A0 regardless of the number of delegations and provides a consistent strategy leading to potentially highest mutual payoff (both players getting 5 points if both delegate), it has a clear advantage for mutual cooperation.

### Step 6: Final Decision

Finally, I will approve only Mediator 2 since it aligns with my goal of maximizing my own points under a cooperative framework and avoids the riskier non-cooperative scenario.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "M1": false,
    "M2": true
}
```

This ensures that the mediator with the highest potential for mutual benefit and highest payoff gets selected.

response:
To make an informed decision about which mediator to approve, I'll analyze the impacts of both mediators on the final outcomes of the game, considering both delegation scenarios (one or both players delegating).

### Breakdown of Payoff Matrix without Mediators:
Let's first analyze the payoff matrix:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0  | A1  |
|---------------------|-----|-----|
| A0                  | 5,5 | 0,3 |
| A1                  | 3,0 | 3,3 |

### Mediator Analysis:
#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- 1 player delegates: Plays A1
- 2 players delegate: Plays A0

**Scenarios:**
1. **Only Player 1 delegates:** 
   - Player 1 plays A1.
   - Player 2 can play either A0 or A1:
     - If Player 2 plays A0: (3, 0)
     - If Player 2 plays A1: (3, 3)

   Player 2 has an incentive to play A1 to maximize their own points.

2. **Both players delegate:**
   - Mediator plays A0 for both.
   - Resulting in (5, 5).

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- 1 player delegates: Plays A0
- 2 players delegate: Plays A0

**Scenarios:**
1. **Only Player 1 delegates:**
   - Player 1 plays A0.
   - Player 2 can play either A0 or A1:
     - If Player 2 plays A0: (5, 5)
     - If Player 2 plays A1: (0, 3)

   Player 2 has an incentive to play A0 to maximize their own points if Player 1 delegates.

2. **Both players delegate:**
   - Mediator plays A0 for both.
   - Resulting in (5, 5).

### Decision Making:
- If both players delegate, both mediators lead to the (A0, A0) outcome yielding (5, 5).
- If only Player 1 delegates:
  - Mediator proposed by Player 1 leads to (3, 3) if Player 2 plays optimally.
  - Mediator proposed by Player 2 leads to (5, 5) if Player 2 plays optimally.

Given this analysis, the mediator proposed by Player 2 seems more favorable to approve as it provides a higher payoff for me in more scenarios without compromising the joint (5, 5) result when both players delegate. However, approving both mediators could also be a way to increase the likelihood of a mediator being chosen that ensures an equilibrium favorable to me.

### Final Decision:
I will provide my approvals in the following manner:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

This approval ensures that the game is played in a way that maximizes my expected outcomes while maintaining fairness and mutual benefit for both players.

To determine which mediators to approve, we need to analyze how each mediator will affect the potential outcomes of the game, given the actions and payoffs described.

### Understanding the Mediator Dynamics:

**Mediator proposed by Player 1 (M1):**
- If **1 player** delegates: Mediator plays A1.
- If **2 players** delegate: Mediator plays A0.

**Mediator proposed by Player 2 (M2):**
- If **1 player** delegates: Mediator plays A0.
- If **2 players** delegate: Mediator plays A0.

### Game Payoff Analysis without Mediators:

#### Payoff Matrix:
|           | Player 2: A0     | Player 2: A1     |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)           | (0, 3)           |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)           | (3, 3)           |

### Considering Mediator Influence:

#### Mediator M1:
1. **1 delegate:** Plays A1.
   - If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not: (A1, ?), possible outcomes: (3, 0) if Player 2 plays A0, or (3, 3) if Player 2 plays A1.
- If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 does not: (A0, A1), outcome: (0, 3).
  
2. **2 delegates:** Both play A0.
   - Outcome (5, 5).

#### Mediator M2:
1. **1 delegate:** Plays A0.
   - If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not: (A0, ?), possible outcomes: (5, 5) if Player 2 plays A0, or (0, 3) if Player 2 plays A1.
- If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 does not: (A0, ?), possible outcomes are the same as above.
  
2. **2 delegates:** Both play A0.
   - Outcome: (5, 5).

### Evaluation:
- **Mediator M1** goes for A1 if only one player delegates, which might lead to the following payoffs:
  - (3, 0) or (3, 3) if Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not.
  - (0, 3) if Player 2 delegates and Player 1 does not.

- **Mediator M2** ensures A0 with any delegation, leading to high cooperation payoffs:
  - (5, 5) if both delegate.
  - (0, 3) or (5, 5) if one delegates.

### Conclusion:
Mediator M2 offers a more consistent and favorable outcome due to its propensity towards cooperation. Mediator M1 might create uncertainty, which isn't ideal if the aim is to maximize cooperative payoffs consistently.

### Final Decision:
- Approve M2 due to its cooperative strategy.
- Disapprove M1 for its potential to yield less optimal payoffs.

Given this analysis, here's the JSON object reflecting the approvals:

```json
{
  "M1": false,

response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we need to analyze the involved payoffs and the presence of a mediator.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix:**

    Here is the payoff matrix for each combination of actions (Player 1, Player 2):
    ```
    Player 2
                A0    A1   A2
    Player 1  ----------------
    A0       |  5, 5 |  0, 3 |  5, 5  (Mediator)
    A1       |  3, 0 |  3, 3 |  3, 3  (Mediator)
    A2       |  5, 5 |  3, 3 |  5, 5  (Mediator)
    ```

2. **Delegation Analysis:**
    - If either player delegates (A2), the mediator will choose A0.
    - Since the mediator was approved by the players for its strategy of picking A0, we might infer that players trust this action to be beneficial.

3. **Strategy Considerations:**
    - High payoff for both players happens if both select A0 or both delegate.
    - Choosing A1 gives a steady but lower individual gain unless the other player chooses A0.

4. **Game Theory Insight:**
    - The game closely resembles a **simultaneous-move coordination game**, where coordinated actions yield higher payoffs.
    - Delegating to the mediator (A2) can avoid the risk of non-coordination, ensuring a mutual payoff of 5 points if both delegate.
    - Independent action A0 also provides the potential for 5 points, but only if the other player also chooses A0.
    
5. **Mixed Strategy:**
    - Given the symmetric nature of the payoff matrix and mediator's action, a sensible strategy involves:
      - High probability for A2 to increase coordination through the mediator.
      - Still maintaining some chance for A0 and A1 to cover potential independent actions by Player 2.

### Final Strategy:
Based on the analysis:
- Heavily weigh on A2 due to the mediator being a reliable way to achieve a high and equal payout.
- Use some distribution towards A0 and A1 to cover scenarios where the other player might independently choose an action.

### JSON Output:
```json

```
This probability distribution provides a balanced approach by betting on coordination via the mediator while maintaining a minor chance for independent high payoff from A0 and A1.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we need to carefully consider the payoff matrix and the twist introduced by the mediator. Here's a breakdown of my thought process:

### Payoff Matrix
Here's the given payoff matrix again for clarity:

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 2: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

### Analysis without Mediator
Without considering the mediator, we first look at potential strategies Player 2 (you) could use. The payoffs suggest a dominant strategy scenario:
- If Player 2 plays A0, the best outcome depends on Player 1 also playing A0 for a total of 5 points.
- If Player 2 plays A1, the payoffs would be lower.

Thus, without any collaboration, the Nash equilibrium would be for both players to play A0.

### Mediator Impact
The additional twist introduces a mediator. Since the mediator will play A0 if any player delegates to it in the game, this could heavily influence the decision-making:

#### Delegation Scenarios:
1. **Only Player 2 delegates to the mediator**:
   - The mediator will play A0 for Player 2.
   - This makes the game effectively the same as Player 2 playing A0 independently.

2. **Both players delegate to the mediator**:
   - The mediator will play A0 for both players.
   - This results in an optimal outcome of (5, 5), the same as both independently choosing A0.

Given the mediator's behavior, delegating to the mediator would allow us to achieve the optimal outcome as long as Player 1 also tends to choose A0 or delegate.

### Strategy Decision
Based on the efficiency of delegating to the mediator, which guarantees an optimal outcome, here’s a mixed strategy considering potential independent actions (especially as a middle ground to mitigate Player 1's mixed strategies):

- **Delegate to Mediator (A2)**: High probability to leverage the mediator's optimal action.
- **A0**: Some probability in case Player 1 acts independently and unpredictably.
- **A1**: Lesser probability since it provides less beneficial payoffs.

### Final Probability Distribution:
Considering the most beneficial move distribution for maximizing points, I will lean heavily on the delegation action. Here is the JSON object with the distribution:

```json
{"A0": 20, "A1": 10, "A2": 70}
```

This means:
- 70% chance to delegate to the mediator.
- 20% chance to play A0 independently.
- 10% chance to play A1 independently.

response:
Both proposed mediators implement the exact same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that delegating player.
- If exactly 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both delegating players.

Since the mediators are identical, there’s no strategic advantage to preferring one over the other at the approval stage. Approving both maximizes the chance that *some* mediator (with this favorable “both delegate → A0” coordination rule) is selected, without any tradeoff between M1 and M2.

response:
To solve this problem, let's take a systematic approach by first understanding the game dynamics with the mediators and then determining which mediators are beneficial for maximizing our points.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**
   The game has the following payoffs:
   - You choose A0, Player 1 chooses A0: (5, 5)
   - You choose A0, Player 1 chooses A1: (0, 3)
   - You choose A1, Player 1 chooses A0: (3, 0)
   - You choose A1, Player 1 chooses A1: (3, 3)

2. **Evaluate Independent (Non-delegated) Play:**
   If the decision is made independently, we should consider mixed strategies. However, here we focus rather on the mediators.

3. **Analyze Mediator Proposed by Player 1 (M1):**
   - If 1 player delegates: Play A1.
   - If 2 players delegate: Play A0.
   
   Let's discuss what this means in practice:
   - If only one player (either Player 1 or Player 2) delegates to the mediator, the mediator will play A1 for that player.
   - If both players delegate, the mediator will play A0 for both players, leading to both players getting 5 points.

4. **Analyze Mediator Proposed by Player 2 (M2):**
   - If 1 player delegates: Play A0.
   - If 2 players delegate: Play A0.
   
   This is straightforward:
   - Regardless of the number of players delegating, the mediator plays A0.

5. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - **Mediator M1:**
     - If both players delegate, then \( (A0, A0) \rightarrow (5, 5) \).
     - If only Player 2 delegates, \( A1 \) would be played for Player 2.
     - Independent Player 1 will play to maximize their payoff against A1, likely choosing A0, leading to \( (A0, A1) \rightarrow (0, 3) \), which isn't beneficial.
   
   - **Mediator M2:**
     - If both players delegate, then \( (A0, A0) \rightarrow (5, 5) \).
     - If only one player delegates (Player 2), \( A0 \) will be played for Player 2.
     - Independent Player 1, knowing \( A0 \) is fixed, is likely to play \( A0 \) as well for mutual benefit, leading to \( (A0, A0) \rightarrow (5, 5) \).

### Conclusion

Given this analysis, both mediators offer the optimal 5-point payoff if both players delegate. However, Mediator M2 is more reliable because it consistently ensures A0 is chosen regardless of the delegation count. Therefore, we should approve both mediators because they both can potentially lead to the highest payoff, but Mediator M2 should be slightly preferred for its consistency.

### Final JSON Output

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

Here, both mediators are approved because they can both potentially lead to (5, 5) outcomes if both players delegate.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy in this decision-making game, we need to consider and analyze both the payoffs and the potential outcomes based on delegation to the mediator. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Understanding the Actions and Payoffs
Each player has three options:
- **A0:** Direct move with specific payoffs.
- **A1:** Direct move with specific payoffs.
- **A2 (Delegate to Mediator):** The mediator will choose the action based on how many players delegate.

The payoffs for the direct actions are:
- **(A0, A0):** Both get 5 points.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
- **(A1, A1):** Both get 3 points.

### Step 2: Mediator Decisions
The mediator's decisions are:
- **If one player delegates (A2):** The mediator will play A1 for the delegator.
- **If both players delegate (A2):** The mediator will play A0 for both.

### Step 3: Exploring Strategic Choices
Let us analyze possible outcomes based on delegating and playing directly.

#### Scenario 1: Neither Player Delegates
Each player's independent choices dictate the outcome strictly based on the payoff matrix.

#### Scenario 2: One Player Delegates
- If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not:
  - Player 1's action (through mediator): A1.
  - Player 2's actions: A0 or A1.

If Player 2 plays:
- **A0:** Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
- **A1:** Both get 3 points.

#### Scenario 3: Both Players Delegate
If both players delegate:
- Both get 5 points (since the mediator will play A0).

### Step 4: Determine Optimal Probability Distribution
Given Player 1's objective is to maximize their total points while considering all scenarios:
- A strong safe payoff point is when both delegate (both get 5 points).
- Delegating leads to a higher consistent outcome if both players cooperate.

However, both players not delegating results in potential lower scores when directly playing competitive strategies:
1. Payoffs ensure higher certainty when both delegate.

Thus, we lean towards delegating with a high probability but also leave some chance to account for unpredictability:

### Final Decision: Mixed Strategy
Given the analysis, we will assign probabilities:
- High probability on delegating to the mediator (A2).
- Small probabilities on A0 and A1 as a safety net to ensure robustness against non-cooperative behavior.

Here's the final optimal probability distribution in JSON format:

```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 10, "A2": 80}
```
Explanation:
- **A0: 10%**: Account for scenarios where not delegating might be optimal in mixed strategy settings.
- **A1: 10%**: Similarly, low chance to compete directly.
- **A2: 80%**: High probability on delegation given the benefits in cooperative settings.

To maximize points in this game, we need to analyze the payoff matrix and the impact of the proposed mediators.

### 1. Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- **(A0, A0):** (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** (3, 0)
- **(A1, A0):** (0, 3)
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)

Looking at the payoffs from Player 2's perspective (me):
- If Player 1 plays **A0**, my best response is **A0** (5 points vs. 3 points).
- If Player 1 plays **A1**, my best response is **A1** (3 points vs. 0 points).

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) which is Pareto optimal (5, 5), and (A1, A1) which is risk-dominant (3, 3). The risk in shooting for the (5, 5) outcome is that if the players fail to coordinate, one player may receive 0 points.

### 2. Mediator Analysis
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **1 player delegates:** The mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- **2 players delegate:** The mediator plays **A0** for both players.

If both players delegate, the outcome is (A0, A0), resulting in **5 points** each.
If only I delegate, and Player 1 plays independently:
- If P1 plays A0, the mediator plays A1 for me; result (A0, A1) is (3, 0) for (P1, Me), so I get **3 points**.
- If P1 plays A1, the mediator plays A1 for me; result (A1, A1) is (3, 3) for (P1, Me), so I get **3 points**.

By delegating, I guarantee myself at least 3 points, regardless of Player 1's choice. If Player 1 also delegates, we both receive the maximum 5 points. This effectively eliminates the risk of receiving 0 points while creating a clear path to the (5, 5) outcome.

### 3. Conclusion
Since both M1 and M2 offer the same beneficial coordination mechanism, I should approve both. This increases the likelihood that a mediator is selected, allowing both players to safely coordinate on the higher payoff.

  "M1": true,
  "M2": true

First, ignore the mediator and look at the base game:

- If the other player plays **A0**, my best response is **A0** (5 > 3).
- If the other player plays **A1**, my best response is **A1** (3 > 0).
So there are two coordination equilibria in the base game: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

Now add **A2 = Delegate** with the mediator rule:
- If **both** delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both → I get **5**.
- If **only I** delegate → mediator plays **A1** for me → I get **3** no matter what the other does (since A1 yields 3 against both A0 and A1).

So from my perspective, **A2 is at least as good as A1 in every case, and strictly better when the other also delegates**:
- Versus other choosing A0: A1 gives 3, A2 gives 3.
- Versus other choosing A1: A1 gives 3, A2 gives 3.
- Versus other choosing A2: A1 would give 3 (since it’s A1 vs A0), but A2 gives 5 (both delegate → both A0).

Therefore, I should never put probability on **A1**, and choosing **A2** is a safe “3-point floor” with upside to 5 if the other delegates too. With no additional information, delegating is the best way to maximize expected payoff.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

The payoff matrix shows a coordination game:
- (A0, A0) → (5, 5) - Best mutual outcome
- (A1, A1) → (3, 3) - Safe but suboptimal
- (A0, A1) → (0, 3) - Bad for me
- (A1, A0) → (3, 0) - Bad for opponent

The challenge: coordinating on the better equilibrium (A0, A0) without communication.

## Step 2: Compare the Mediators

**M1 (my proposal):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**M2 (opponent's proposal):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1  
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

The mediators are **identical**!

## Step 3: Analyze Delegation Outcomes

Let me consider all scenarios:

1. **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → **(5, 5)** ✓ Optimal!

2. **Only I delegate**: Mediator plays A1 for me
   - Opponent best responds with A1 → **(3, 3)**

3. **Only opponent delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for them
   - I best respond with A1 → **(3, 3)**

4. **Neither delegates**: We play the base coordination game
   - Risk of miscoordination or settling on inferior (A1, A1)

## Step 4: Strategic Analysis

The mediator creates a powerful coordination mechanism:
- **Mutual delegation is a Nash equilibrium** achieving (5, 5)
- If opponent delegates, I prefer to delegate (5 > 3)
- The mediator punishes unilateral delegation but rewards mutual delegation
- This solves the coordination problem!

## Step 5: Approval Decision

Since both mediators are identical and both provide a beneficial coordination device that helps achieve the optimal outcome, I should approve both.

response:
To solve this decision-making problem, we need to carefully consider both the payoffs and the behavior of the mediator. Our goal is to maximize our total points.

Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the Basic Game Without Mediation
We first look at the payoffs for each action combination if we and the other player choose to play independently:
- If both choose A0: We get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If we choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: We get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If we choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: We get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: Both get 3 points.

### Step 2: Consider the Mediator’s Impact
Next, we examine the mediator’s strategy:
- If only one player delegates to the mediator, the mediator will play A1.
- If both players delegate to the mediator, the mediator will play A0.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Decision to Delegate to the Mediator
When delegating to the mediator:
- If we delegate and the other player doesn't, the mediator will play A1 on our behalf, yielding:
  - For (A1, A0): We get 3 points.
  - For (A1, A1): We get 3 points.
 
- If both delegate:
  - For (A0, A0): We get 5 points.

### Step 4: Mixed Strategy Analysis
Our mixed strategy involves setting probabilities for:
- Playing A0 directly.
- Playing A1 directly.
- Delegating to the mediator (A2).

We need to balance between these choices to maximize our expected payoff. Given the structure:
- A0 has the highest payoff if both coordinate (i.e., both play A0).
- A1 has a consistent although lower payoff.
- A2 (delegating) achieves a high payoff if both players delegate, but results in a consistent medium payoff if the other player does not delegate.

To maximize our total points:
- We need a higher probability of aligning with the mediator if both delegate.
- A reasonable distribution to capture the optimal coordination dynamics while still having a good chance to get moderate points if the other player chooses otherwise would be advantageous.

Based on these considerations, our strategic distribution could look like setting:
- A slightly higher probability to delegate (A2), given its highest potential coordinated payout.
- Balance residual points between A0 and A1.

### Step 5: Formulate the Final Probability Distribution

Let's structure probabilities:
- Delegate (A2) dominance should be given a reasonable but not overwhelming chance.
- Given coordination likelihood and points distribution, a moderate approach can be:
  - A2: 60% (balancing high potential win if both delegate)
  - A0: 20% (benefit if both independent A0)
  - A1: 20% (fallback in mixed independent cases)

Given this thought process, the final JSON object is:

```json
{"A0": 20, "A1": 20, "A2": 60}
```

This configuration maximizes the potential for high payout coordination with reasonable fallback when independents diverge.

response:
To maximize points in this game, it is essential to compare the original game's dynamics with the dynamics introduced by the mediators.

### 1. Original Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two Nash Equilibria: (**A0, A0**) with a payoff of (5, 5) and (**A1, A1**) with a payoff of (3, 3). While (A0, A0) is Pareto optimal (offering the highest points), (A1, A1) is often considered "safer." If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you receive 0 points. If you choose A1, you are guaranteed at least 3 points regardless of the other player's choice.

### 2. Mediator Analysis
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both players.

If a mediator is selected, players have a new option: **Delegate (D)**. Let’s look at the payoffs for Player 2 (you) when a mediator is active:
- **You choose D, Player 1 chooses D:** n=2, mediator plays (A0, A0). Your points: **5**.
- **You choose D, Player 1 plays A0:** n=1, mediator plays A1 for you. Outcome (A0, A1). Your points: **3**.
- **You choose D, Player 1 plays A1:** n=1, mediator plays A1 for you. Outcome (A1, A1). Your points: **3**.

By delegating, Player 2 (you) is guaranteed at least 3 points, with a high potential for 5 points if Player 1 also delegates. Delegating **weakly dominates** playing A1 (which always gives 3 points) and is significantly less risky than playing A0 independently (which can result in 0 points).

### 3. Approval Decision
Because the mediators are identical and both introduce a mechanism that makes the higher-payoff equilibrium (5, 5) safer and more likely to achieve, they are beneficial to both players. There is no reason to reject either mediator, as they both offer the same protective coordination mechanism.

Approving both mediators ensures that one of them is highly likely to be selected, moving the game from a risky choice between A0 and A1 to a safer, more coordinated choice involving delegation.

response:
To arrive at the best strategy, let's reason through the game step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Basic Payoffs**:
    - If both players choose A0: Both get 5 points.
    - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, and the other player gets 3 points.
    - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, and the other player gets 0 points.
    - If both players choose A1: Both get 3 points.

2. **Mediator Rules**:
    - If 1 player delegates: Mediator plays A1.
    - If 2 players delegate: Mediator plays A0.

### Expectations Based on Mediator Choices:

- **One Player Delegates (and the other plays independently)**:
    - If you delegate and the other player does not, the mediator will play A1 for you.
    - The independent player, knowing that you will play A1 via the mediator, might choose A0 to maximize their points (since A0 against A1 gives them 3 points).

- **Both Players Delegate**:
    - If both players delegate, the mediator will play A0 for both.
    - Both players get 5 points.

### Mixed Strategy Consideration:

- **Pure Strategy Dominance**:
    - When both delegate, both get the highest mutual payoff (5 points each) compared to the other options.

### Strategy Formulation:

1. **Pure Delegation (A2)**:
    - If both players delegate, the payoff is highest (5 points each).
2. **Strategic Independence**:
    - If you act independently (A0 or A1), outcomes depend on the other player's choice, with potential lower payoffs.

### Optimum Strategy in Mixed Approach:

- Lean heavily towards delegation due to mutual higher payoff.
- Small probability to play independently to prevent over-dependence on the mediator, ensuring robustness in strategy.

Based on these considerations, the optimum mixed strategy would heavily favor delegating to the mediator (A2), with smaller probabilities for A0 and A1 to introduce variability and strategic complexity.

### Final Probability Distribution:

Let's assume 70% delegation, and 15% for A0 and A1 each.

### JSON Object Output:

```json
{"A0": 15, "A1": 15, "A2": 70}
```

This distribution ensures a high likelihood of achieving the maximum points through mutual delegation, while still retaining some unpredictability.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Understanding the Base Game

Let me first analyze the payoff structure from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5, they get 5 ✓ Best mutual outcome
- (A0, A1): I get 0, they get 3 
- (A1, A0): I get 3, they get 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, they get 3 ✓ Safe but suboptimal

**Key insight**: This game has two Nash equilibria:
1. (A0, A0) - both get 5 points (Pareto optimal)
2. (A1, A1) - both get 3 points (safer but worse)

The problem is **coordination risk**: without communication, we might fail to coordinate on the better (A0, A0) outcome.

## Analyzing the Proposed Mediators

Both M1 and M2 have **identical** strategies:
- 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

## Evaluating the Delegation Game

With the mediator, I have three strategic options:
- Delegate (D)
- Don't delegate and play A0 (NA0)  
- Don't delegate and play A1 (NA1)

Key outcomes:
- **(D, D)**: Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → **(5, 5)** ✓ Nash equilibrium
- **(NA0, NA0)**: Neither delegates → **(5, 5)** ✓ Nash equilibrium
- **(NA1, NA1)**: Neither delegates → **(3, 3)** ✓ Nash equilibrium
- **(D, NA1)**: I delegate → mediator plays A1 for me, they play A1 → **(3, 3)**

## Benefits of the Mediator

1. **Creates a focal point**: (D, D) is a simple, symmetric strategy that achieves the optimal (5, 5) outcome
2. **No downside**: The mediator doesn't eliminate any good equilibria
3. **Coordination aid**: Delegating is a clearer coordination signal than trying to guess which action to play independently
4. **Risk reduction**: If we both trust the mediator mechanism, we can guarantee (5, 5) by both delegating

## Strategic Voting Decision

Since:
- M1 and M2 are **functionally identical**
- Having a mediator available is **beneficial** for coordination
- I want to maximize the probability a mediator is selected

I should **approve both mediators** to ensure maximum approval count regardless of what Player 2 does.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): 5 points for me
- (A0, A1): 0 points for me  
- (A1, A0): 3 points for me
- (A1, A1): 3 points for me

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → 5,5 (best outcome)
- (A1, A1) → 3,3 (worse outcome)

The challenge is coordinating on the better equilibrium.

## Step 2: Compare the mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

## Step 3: Analyze outcomes with the mediator

With either mediator present, I have 3 options: Delegate (D), play A0, or play A1.

Key outcomes:
- (D, D): Both delegate → Mediator plays A0 for both → **5,5**
- (D, A0): I delegate → Mediator plays A1 for me → 3,0
- (D, A1): I delegate → Mediator plays A1 for me → 3,3
- (A0, D): Other delegates → Mediator plays A1 for them → 0,3

## Step 4: Evaluate delegation strategy

If I delegate:
- Best case (other delegates): 5 points
- Worst case (other plays A0): 3 points
- Guaranteed minimum: 3 points

If I play A0:
- Best case: 5 points
- Worst case: 0 points
- Risky!

**Delegation provides a guaranteed floor of 3 points** while maintaining access to the optimal 5-point outcome.

## Step 5: Strategic advantage

The mediator creates (D, D) as a focal point for coordination:
1. It's a credible commitment device
2. Delegation weakly dominates A1  
3. It helps avoid the bad equilibrium at (A1, A1)
4. It provides a clear coordination mechanism

## Conclusion

Both mediators are identical and beneficial. They:
- Don't create any worse outcomes
- Add a coordination mechanism for the optimal outcome
- Provide strategic stability through delegation

**Final Answer:**

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}

response:
To maximize the points received in this game, we must analyze the payoff matrix, including the option to delegate to the mediator (Action A2).

**1. Payoff Matrix Analysis:**
Let’s identify the points for Player 2 (you) based on the actions of Player 1 and Player 2:
*   (A0, A0): Both get 5 points.
*   (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3.
*   (A1, A0): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0. (Note: These roles are inverted from the user's perspective if acting as Player 1, but based on the provided instructions, we are Player 2.)
*   (A1, A1): Both get 3 points.

**2. Mediator Analysis (Action A2):**
*   **If 1 player delegates (P2):** The mediator plays A1 for P2.
    *   If P1 plays A0: Result (A0, A1) -> P2 gets 3 pts.
    *   If P1 plays A1: Result (A1, A1) -> P2 gets 3 pts.
*   **If 2 players delegate (P1 and P2):** The mediator plays A0 for both.
    *   Result (A0, A0) -> P2 gets 5 pts.
*   **If P1 delegates (P1=A2) and P2 plays independently:**
    *   If P2 plays A0: Result (A1, A0) -> P2 gets 0 pts.
    *   If P2 plays A1: Result (A1, A1) -> P2 gets 3 pts.

**3. Decision Matrix for Player 2:**
*   **If P2 plays A0:** [5, 0, 0] (Points if P1 plays A0, A1, or A2)
*   **If P2 plays A1:** [3, 3, 3]
*   **If P2 plays A2:** [3, 3, 5]

**4. Conclusion:**
Comparing P2's actions:
- **A1 vs. A2:** A2 weakly dominates A1. A2 provides the same payoff as A1 (3 points) if P1 plays A0 or A1, but a higher payoff (5 points) if P1 also selects A2.
- **A0 vs. A2:** A0 is highly risky. While it offers 5 points if P1 plays A0, it drops to 0 if P1 plays A1 or A2. Conversely, A2 guarantees at least 3 points and offers 5 points if both players delegate.

Since both players are looking to maximize points and are likely to recognize that A2 is the safer, high-reward strategy that leads to a Nash Equilibrium (A2, A2) yielding (5, 5), the optimal move is to delegate to the mediator.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

The natural Nash equilibrium without a mediator is (A0, A0) giving both players 5 points.

## Step 2: Analyze Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)

M1 plays A1 if 1 player delegates, A0 if 2 players delegate.

Possible outcomes:
- **Both delegate**: (A0, A0) → I get **5**
- **Only P1 delegates**: P1 plays A1, I optimally respond with A1 → I get **3**
- **Only I delegate**: I play A1, P1 responds optimally (getting 3 either way) → I get **0-3** 
- **Neither delegates**: Nash equilibrium (A0, A0) → I get **5**

M1 creates coordination risk - if only one player delegates, outcomes are worse (3 or less for me vs 5).

## Step 3: Analyze Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)

M2 plays A0 regardless of how many players delegate.

Possible outcomes:
- **Both delegate**: (A0, A0) → I get **5**
- **Only P1 delegates**: P1 plays A0, I optimally play A0 → I get **5**
- **Only I delegate**: I play A0, P1 optimally plays A0 → I get **5**
- **Neither delegates**: Nash equilibrium (A0, A0) → I get **5**

M2 guarantees the cooperative outcome (5,5) in ALL cases - zero coordination risk!

## Step 4: Strategic voting decision

M2 is strictly better than M1 for me (and also for Player 1) because it eliminates coordination risk.

If I approve only M2:
- If P1 approves M2 (alone or with M1): M2 wins
- If P1 approves only M1: 50-50 chance

If I approve both M1 and M2:
- If P1 approves only M1: M1 wins deterministically (bad!)
- Otherwise: 50-50 or M2 wins

By approving only M2, I avoid the worst case where M1 wins deterministically, and maximize M2's chances of winning.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing the total points, we need to consider the different possible scenarios and their respective probabilities for reaching different outcomes.

### Analysis:

1. **Independent Choices:**
   - If both players choose A0: Both get 5 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
   - If both players choose A1: Both get 3 points.

2. **Delegation to the Mediator:**
   - The mediator always chooses A0 whether one or both players delegate.
   - If both delegate, it's equivalent to both choosing A0: Both get 5 points.
   - If only one player delegates, the delegating player effectively plays A0.

### Possible Strategies:

- **Pure Strategies:**
  - Always playing A0
  - Always playing A1
  - Always delegating (A2)

- **Mixed Strategies:**
  - Combine the actions A0, A1, and A2 with certain probabilities.

### Expected Value Calculation:

1. **Without Delegation:**
   - If both players coordinate to always choose A0: Each gets 5 points.
   - If there's no coordination, mixed strategies need to be modelled with probabilities.

2. **Mixed Strategy:**
   - Let's assume probabilities \( p \) for A0, \( q \) for A1, and \( r \) for delegating (A2). Note that \( p + q + r = 100\% \) or 1 in decimal form.

3. **Outcome Probabilities and Expected Payoffs:**
   - Consider different potential strategies for Player 2 as well.
   - With given payoffs, we want to trace our optimal response aimed to coordinate especially considering the mediator's strategy favors choosing A0 if we delegate.

Let's simplify:
- **If both delegate (best outcome):**
  - Total: \( 5 \) points each.
- **Likely optimal strategy includes a high likelihood to delegate:**
  - Encourages coordination to maximize points.

### Final Optimal Mixed Strategy:
Given the utility of delegation ensuring both choose A0, a high delegation probability ensures maximum points. Hence:
- Allocate the highest probability to A2 (delegation).
- Smaller proportions to A0 and A1 assuming potential mixed reactions from Player 2.

### JSON Output:

```json
{"A0": 20, "A1": 0, "A2": 80}
```

### Explanation:
- **A0:** 20% probability of direct cooperation in case the other player does not delegate.
- **A2:** 80% probability ensuring strong mediation-based cooperation.

This strategy provides a high probability of coordination via delegation, aiming at the maximum payoff of 5 points each through the mediator.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game Payoffs

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points  
- (A1, A0): 3 points
- (A1, A1): 3 points

## Step 2: Analyze the Mediator's Behavior

The mediator plays:
- **A1** if only 1 player delegates
- **A0** if both players delegate

## Step 3: Calculate Payoffs with Delegation Option

**If I delegate and the other player:**
- Plays A0: Mediator gives me A1 → I get 3 points
- Plays A1: Mediator gives me A1 → I get 3 points
- Also delegates: Mediator gives us both A0 → I get 5 points

**If I play A0 and the other player:**
- Plays A0: 5 points
- Plays A1: 0 points
- Delegates: They get A1, I play A0 → I get 0 points

**If I play A1 and the other player:**
- Plays A0: 3 points
- Plays A1: 3 points
- Delegates: They get A1, I play A1 → I get 3 points

## Step 4: Identify Nash Equilibria

Three pure strategy Nash equilibria exist:
1. (A0, A0): Both get 5
2. (A1, A1): Both get 3
3. (A2, A2): Both delegate → both get 5

## Step 5: Strategic Analysis

Key observation: **Delegating weakly dominates playing A1**
- Against A0: Both give 3 points
- Against A1: Both give 3 points  
- Against A2: Delegation gives 5, A1 gives only 3

The mediator was proposed by me (Player 1) and approved by voting, signaling mutual interest in coordination. The mediator creates a focal point for cooperation: mutual delegation guarantees the optimal outcome of 5 points each.

## Step 6: Best Response

If I believe the other player will delegate (rational given the mediator approval):
- A0 gives: 0 points
- A1 gives: 3 points
- A2 gives: 5 points

Delegation is strictly my best response.

## Conclusion

The rational strategy is to delegate with certainty, achieving the cooperative outcome of 5 points.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Understanding the Base Game

First, let me understand the payoff structure:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 points
- (A0, A1): I get 0 points  
- (A1, A0): I get 3 points
- (A1, A1): I get 3 points

Without any mediator, the Nash equilibrium of this game gives both players approximately 3 points in expectation.

## Analyzing Each Mediator

**Mediator 1 (M1 - my proposal):**
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

Let me trace through the scenarios:
- **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → Both get 5 ✓
- **Only I delegate**: Mediator plays A1 for me. Other player's best response to A1 is A1 (gets 3 vs 0) → (A1, A1) → Both get 3
- **Only other delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for them. My best response to A1 is A1 (I get 3 vs 0) → (A1, A1) → Both get 3
- **Neither delegates**: Back to base game Nash → Both get ~3

**Mediator 2 (M2 - Player 2's proposal):**
- If 1 player delegates: plays A0
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

Let me trace through:
- **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → Both get 5 ✓
- **Only I delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for me. Other player's best response to A0 is A0 (gets 5 vs 3) → (A0, A0) → Both get 5 ✓
- **Only other delegates**: Mediator plays A0 for them. My best response to A0 is A0 (I get 5 vs 3) → (A0, A0) → Both get 5 ✓
- **Neither delegates**: Back to base game Nash → Both get ~3

## Comparison

M2 is strictly better than M1 because:
- When both delegate: Both give (5, 5) - **TIE**
- When only one delegates: M2 gives (5, 5), M1 gives (3, 3) - **M2 WINS**
- When neither delegates: Both give (3, 3) - **TIE**

M2 is more robust - it achieves the optimal cooperative outcome (5, 5) as long as **at least one** player delegates, whereas M1 requires **both** players to delegate to achieve (5, 5).

## Decision

Since M2 weakly dominates M1 from my perspective (and is strictly better in some cases), I should approve only M2 to ensure it gets selected.

```json
{"M1": false, "M2": true}

response:
To decide the probabilities for choosing actions A0, A1, and A2 (Delegate to Mediator), let's analyze the payoff structure and understand the impact of each action. 

### Analyzing the Payoffs

1. **If both players choose A0:**
   - Player 2 gets 5 points.
   - Player 1 gets 5 points.

2. **If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:**
   - Player 2 gets 0 points.
   - Player 1 gets 3 points.

3. **If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:**
   - Player 2 gets 3 points.
   - Player 1 gets 0 points.

4. **If both players choose A1:**
   - Player 2 gets 3 points.
   - Player 1 gets 3 points.

### Considering the Mediator Option

The mediator will play A0 if any players delegate, and the mediator is likely to play A0 as both players presumably prefer the higher payoff if they both delegate.

### Strategy: 

- **Delegating to Mediator (A2):** Delegating ensures that A0 is played if the other player also delegates. Coordination here can yield the maximum payoff.
- **Choosing A0 Independently:** If Player 1 independently chooses A0, it is effectively the same result as if both choose A0 via delegation.
- **Choosing A1 Independently:** This is more of a defensive strategy to avoid getting zero points if Player 1 tends to choose A0.

### Conclusion:

From Player 2's perspective, the best strategies would involve giving a significant probability to:
1. Delegating to the mediator when there's trust in mutual rationality.
2. Choosing A0 otherwise as a complement strategy.
3. A1 can only be a minor strategy to guard against unpredictable moves from Player 1.

### Final Mixed Strategy (Probabilities):

Let's decide a balanced distribution for probabilities:
- **A0 (if Player 2 independently plays A0):** Important fallback to ensure a good outcome if mutual rationality fails, but less than delegation.
- **A1 (if Player 2 independently plays A1):** Least preferred to avoid zero payoff risks.
- **A2 (Delegate to Mediator):** Highest probability to maximize the chances of both players coordinating towards 5 points.

Suggested probabilities:
- 60% for A2 (Delegate to Mediator)
- 30% for A0
- 10% for A1

### JSON Object:

```json
{"A0": 30, "A1": 10, "A2": 60}
```

This strategy aims to maximize the expected points by leveraging the mediator's capacity to ensure the highest mutual payoff while maintaining options to respond to potential independence by Player 1.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

The payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): both get 5 ← **best mutual outcome**
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0  
- (A1, A1): both get 3

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving (5,5) and (A1, A1) giving (3,3). The challenge is coordinating on the better equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze Mediator 1 (My Proposal)

**M1 behavior:**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**What happens in each case:**
- Both delegate: Both play A0 → **(5, 5)** ✓
- Only I delegate: I play A1, other best responds with A1 → (3, 3)
- Only other delegates: Other plays A1, I best respond with A1 → (3, 3)
- Neither delegates: Back to coordination problem

**Analysis:** Delegation is NOT dominant with M1. The delegation decision itself becomes a coordination game. Both delegating is an equilibrium but not guaranteed.

## Step 3: Analyze Mediator 2 (Other Player's Proposal)

**M2 behavior:**
- 1 player delegates → plays A0
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**What happens in each case:**
- Both delegate: Both play A0 → **(5, 5)** ✓
- Only I delegate: I play A0, other best responds with A0 → **(5, 5)** ✓
- Only other delegates: Other plays A0, I best respond with A0 → **(5, 5)** ✓
- Neither delegates: Back to coordination problem

**Analysis:** Delegation is DOMINANT with M2! No matter what the other player does, delegating gives me 5 points. Same for the other player.

## Step 4: Compare Mediators

- **M1**: Achieves (5,5) only with mutual delegation; creates a coordination problem at the delegation stage
- **M2**: Makes delegation a dominant strategy; guarantees (5,5) as long as at least one player delegates

**M2 is strictly superior** from both players' perspectives.

## Step 5: Strategic Voting

Since M2 is objectively better for both players:
- Player 2 will almost certainly approve M2 (they proposed it and it's optimal)
- If I approve only M2: Very likely M2 wins (gets at least 2 votes)
- If I approve both M1 and M2: Risks 50/50 selection if both get 2 votes

Even though I proposed M1, M2 better serves my goal of maximizing points.

{"M1": false, "M2": true}

Let’s carefully analyze the game and the mediation mechanism step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We are **Player 2** in this symmetric game. The payoff matrix for the base game (with Player 1 choosing rows, Player 2 choosing columns) is:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P2: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

We are Player 2, so we care about maximizing our own points.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze best responses and equilibrium**

Let’s find the Nash equilibria.

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2’s best response: A0 (5 > 3)
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2’s best response: A1 (3 > 0)

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1’s best response: A0 (5 > 3)
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1’s best response: A1 (3 > 0)

So the pure strategy Nash equilibria are:
- (A0, A0): (5,5)
- (A1, A1): (3,3)

There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium, but in most such games with symmetric payoffs, and when both players are rational, the symmetric outcome is often (A0,A0) or mixed.

But note: (A0,A0) gives both players 5, which is higher than (A1,A1)’s 3. So rational players might try to coordinate on A0.

However, there is a **temptation to defect**: if I play A1 while the other plays A0, I get 3, not 0. So I gain nothing from playing A1 when the other plays A0 — I only lose points.

Wait: if I play A1 and other plays A0, I get 3 (same as if I played A0). But the other player gets 0 — so that hurts the other player.

But if I play A1 and other plays A1, I get 3.

So if I think the other will play A0, I can safely play A1 and still get 3 (not 5). So that’s worse for me.

Therefore, **if the other player is playing A0**, I am indifferent between A0 (get 5) and A1 (get 3). So A0 is strictly better.

Similarly, if the other plays A1, I get 3 from both A0 and A1, so indifferent.

So my best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → choose A0 (5 > 3)
- If P1 plays A1 → choose A1 (3 = 3, but A1 is safe, A0 gives 0)

Actually: if P1 plays A1:
- My choice:
  - A0 → I get 0
  - A1 → I get 3

So best response is A1.

So the only pure strategy equilibria are:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

Now, suppose we are both trying to coordinate on (A0,A0). But if I believe the other will play A0, I should play A0 for 5. If I play A1, I get only 3.

So **A0 is a dominant strategy?** Wait: no.

Is A0 dominant?

- If P1 plays A0: I get 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → A0 better
- If P1 plays A1: I get 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → A1 better

So **neither A0 nor A1 is dominant**. It's a coordination game with a conflict of interest?

Wait: Let's recheck.

Payoffs:
- (A0,A0): (5,5)
- (A0,A1): (0,3)
- (A1,A0): (3,0)
- (A1,A1): (3,3)

Now, for **Player 2**, the payoffs are:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 5 (A0) or 3 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: I get 0 (A0) or 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So Player 2's best response depends on P1’s move.

Same for P1.

So this is **not** a prisoner’s dilemma, it's more like a **battle of the sexes** or **coordination game with asymmetric payoffs?**

Actually, it's symmetric in structure: symmetric outcomes, but asymmetric in off-diagonal payoffs.

But both players have a **conflict of interest**: when one plays A0 and the other A1, the one who plays A1 gets 3, the one who plays A0 gets 0.

So the players want to coordinate on the same action, but prefer different ones if coordination fails?

No — let’s think.

Actually, both players **prefer A0** when the other plays A0: 5 points.
Both get 3 if they play A1 and other plays A1.

But if I play A0 and the other plays A1, I get 0 — bad.
If I play A1 and the other plays A0, I get 3 — better than 0, but worse than 5.

So **A0 is better when coordinated**, but if we fail to coordinate, it is worse for me if I play A0 and other plays A1.

So this is a **coordination game with a payoff advantage for A0**.

The equilibria are:
- (A0, A0): (5,5)
- (A1, A1): (3,3)

There is no equilibrium with mixed strategies? Actually, there are.

Let’s compute mixed strategy.

Let P1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1−p.

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- A0: p×5 + (1−p)×0 = 5p
- A1: p×3 + (1−p)×3 = 3

Set equal for indifference: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5

So if P1 plays A0 with p = 0.6, Player 2 is indifferent.

Similarly, by symmetry, the mixed strategy equilibrium is: each plays A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

Then expected payoff for each: 3 (since if both mix, and play A0, we get 5, but the probabilities make it average out).

Let’s compute:
- P(both A0) = 0.6×0.6 = 0.36 → 5
- P(A0,A1) = 0.6×0.4 = 0.24 → 0
- P(A1,A0) = 0.4×0.6 = 0.24 → 3
- P(A1,A1) = 0.4×0.4 = 0.16 → 3

Player 2’s expected payoff:
= 0.36×5 + 0.24×0 + 0.24×3 + 0.16×3
= 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

So mixed strategy equilibrium gives 3.

But (A0,A0) gives 5, which is better.

So rational players might want to coordinate on A0.

But if I think the other player will play A0, I should play A0.
If I think the other will play A1, I should play A1.

But the problem is: how to coordinate?

This is where **delegation** comes in.

---

### **Step 3: Understanding the delegation mechanism**

Before the game, players vote on which mediators to approve.

- There are two mediators proposed: one by Player 1, one by Player 2.
- Both have the same behavior:
  - If 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
  - If 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

So mediator behavior is **identical**, regardless of who proposed it.

Thus, both M1 and M2 have the same rules.

So why would one be better than the other?

Perhaps the proposal source matters.

But the final mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

We cannot know which one will win — but we can choose to approve or disapprove both.

The question is: **do we approve of M1?** **M2?**

Since they are **identical in behavior**, but possibly different in identity.

But the decision must be binary: approve or not.

Now, the real issue: **what outcome do we want?**

We want to maximize **our own points**.

The delegation mechanism says:
- We can **delegate** our action to the chosen mediator.
- The mediator will play based on **how many players have delegated**.

So let’s suppose:
- We and the other player each decide independently whether to delegate.
- The mediator is selected from the approved ones with the most approvals.
- Then, if we delegate, the mediator plays for us based on the number of delegators (1 or 2).

Our goal: pick a strategy (approvals) to maximize our expected payoff.

But note: the approval vote happens **before** we decide whether to delegate.

So we must set our approvals **in advance**, knowing that:
- If we approve a mediator, it’s a candidate to be selected.
- The winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from the set of approved mediators with the **maximum number of approvals**.

Let’s suppose both mediators are identical in behavior.

So regardless of which one wins, the outcome is the same.

So **we don't care which one wins**, as long as it’s one of the approved ones.

Now, we can approve both, one, or none.

But if we approve only one, and the other player approves only one (maybe the other), then we risk no mediator being selected? No.

Wait: the winning mediator is selected from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

Let me re-read:

> The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

So if we approve M1 only → approval count = 1.

If the other player approves M1 only → total = 2 → M1 has max (2), so M1 is selected.

If the other player approves M2 only → total approval count for M1 is 1, M2 is 1 → max = 1, so both are tied for max → winner chosen uniformly at random from {M1, M2} → 50% chance either.

But both mediators have **identical behavior**, so it doesn’t matter.

So if we approve both, then as long as at least one of us approves a mediator, the max approval count will be at least 1, and the selected mediator will be one of the approved ones.

Let’s consider all possibilities.

---

### **Step 4: Strategic analysis of delegation**

We can choose to delegate or not.

Suppose we **both** delegate to the mediator.

Then, since 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0**.

So both get (5,5) if the other also delegates → that’s great.

But if **only one** of us delegates, then mediator plays **A1**.

Then, the delegator gets A1, the non-delegator decides independently.

Suppose we delegate → mediator plays A1 → we play A1.

Then the other player decides: if they choose A0, we get 0 (since we play A1, they play A0), they get 3.

If they also choose A1, we both get 3.

So if only one delegates, and that player is me → I get 3 (since mediator plays A1), and the other player can choose to play A1 (get 3) or A0 (get 0).

So the other player will choose A1 (to get 3 instead of 0).

So outcome: both play A1 → both get 3.

Similarly, if the other delegates and I don’t → I will choose A1 (because if I play A0 and they play A1, I get 0; if I play A1, I get 3). So I will play A1 → both get 3.

So in the case of **exactly one delegate**, both end up playing A1 → both get 3.

If **both delegate**, then mediator plays A0 (since 2 delegates), so both play A0 → both get 5.

If **neither delegates**, then both choose independently.

We can assume both players will choose A0 (since it gives us 5 when the other plays A0), or A1.

But in the base game, (A0,A0) is better for both than (A1,A1).

So if no one delegates, we will likely both play A0 → get 5 each.

But **only if we coordinate**.

Is (A0,A0) a stable outcome? Yes — as we saw, it's a Nash equilibrium.

But if one thinks the other will play A1, then they may play A1.

But assuming rational players who can coordinate, they might play (A0,A0).

So in **no delegation**, outcome: (A0,A0) → 5 each.

In **one delegate**, outcome: (A1,A1) → 3 each.

In **two delegates**, outcome: (A0,A0) → 5 each.

So the delegation mechanism gives us a **way to coordinate on A0**.

If we both commit to delegate, we **guarantee** (A0,A0).

If only one delegates, we get (A1,A1) — worse than (A0,A0).

If no one delegates, we get (A0,A0) — good.

But **is there a risk of not coordinating?**

Suppose we think the other won’t delegate.

Then we are better off not delegating: we can play A0 → get 5.

But if we delegate, and the other doesn't, we end up with A1 → only 3.

So if I don’t think the other will delegate, I may prefer not to delegate.

But if I think the other will delegate, I might want to delegate to get guaranteed A0.

But the mediator is only chosen **after** approval, and the vote is **anonymous**.

So players must decide in advance whether to approve mediators, without knowing each other's actions.

Now, back to our **approval decision**.

We want to choose a set of mediators to approve.

The **goal** is to **maximize our expected payoff**.

Since both mediators behave identically, **we should approve both**?

Why?

Because:
- If we approve only one, say M1, and the other approves only M2, then both have 1 approval → max approval = 1 → winner chosen uniform at random from {M1, M2} → 50% chance either.

But since both behave the same, it doesn’t matter.

But now, in the delegation phase:
- If both of us decide to delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → (5,5)
- If only one delegates → outcome (A1,A1) → 3
- If none → (A0,A0) → 5

But the **mediator is chosen based on approvals**, and the **delegation decisions are separate**.

So we need to think about **what outcomes are possible** depending on our approval strategy.

Now, the key point: **if we do not approve any mediator, then there is no mediator, so we cannot delegate.**

But the problem says: “you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator” — but only if a mediator is present.

So if no mediator is selected, **delegation is not possible**.

So if we **approve no mediator**, then the game proceeds without delegation.

Likewise, **if the winning mediator has 0 approvals**, but no — the selection is from those with **maximum approvals**, so if no one approves a mediator, the set is empty — but the problem says “the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals” — if max is 0, the set is empty.

So in that case, no mediator exists → **no delegation possible**.

So to allow delegation, **at least one mediator must be approved**.

Now, **what is our best strategy for approval?**

Let’s suppose that **both players are rational and want to maximize their own points**, and can coordinate expectations.

We want to **encourage coordination on delegation** to ensure both play A0 via the mediator.

But if one player delegates and the other doesn’t, we get (A1,A1) → only 3.

So if we can get both to delegate, we get 5.

But if only one delegates → 3.

Now, if we don’t delegate, and we’re symmetric, we get (A0,A0) → 5.

So **delegation is only beneficial if both do it**.

But we need to **ensure that a mediator exists**.

Now, the **critical question**: can we **guarantee** that both players will delegate?

Not necessarily — but we can **incentivize** it.

But we don’t control the other player.

We are only allowed to decide on approvals.

Now, here’s the key intuition:

- If we **approve both mediators**, then **regardless of the other player’s approvals**, as long as **at least one mediator is approved**, a mediator will be selected.

- If we approve **only one**, and the other player also approves only one (the other), then both mediators have 1 approval → max is 1 → winner chosen at random → a mediator exists.

- If we approve only one, and the other approves **only one and the same one**, then that one has 2 approvals → it is selected.

So **only if both approve different mediators, and we each approve only one, we still have a mediator**.

Wait: let’s define.

Let’s denote:
- I approve M1 and M2: so I have approved both.
- If the other player approves only M1 → M1 has 2 approvals (me and other), M2 has 1 → max is 2 → M1 selected.

- If the other approves only M2 → M2 has 2, M1 has 1 → M2 selected.

- If the other approves both → both have 2 → max is 2 → winner selected uniformly at random from {M1,M2} → but both identical → no issue.

So in all cases, **if I approve both, then there will be a mediator**.

Now, if I approve **only one**, say M1.

Then:
- If the other approves M1 → M1 has 2 approvals → selected.
- If the other approves M2 only → M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → max is 1 → winner chosen at random → 50% M1, 50% M2 → mediator exists.
- If the other approves both → M1 has 2, M2 has 2 → max is 2 → randomly selected.

So **as long as the other player approves at least one**, a mediator exists.

But what if the other player approves **neither**?

Then:
- M1: 1 (me), M2: 0 → max is 1 → M1 is selected (since only one with approval count 1).

So **if I approve M1 only, and the other approves nothing, then M1 is selected**.

Similarly, even if the other approves nothing, I still get a mediator.

So in all cases, **as long as I approve at least one mediator, a mediator will be present**.

Is that true?

- If I approve only M1 → approval counts:
  - M1: 1
  - M2: 0 (if other approves nothing)
  → max is 1 → M1 is selected.

- If I approve M1 only, other approves M2 only → M1:1, M2:1 → max is 1 → winner chosen at random from both → mediator selected.

So yes: **as long as I approve at least one mediator, a mediator will be selected**.

But if I approve **no mediators**, then:
- M1: 0, M2: 0 → max is 0 → the set of mediators with max approvals is empty → **no mediator selected**.

So **if I approve no mediators, there is no delegation**.

So to allow delegation, I must approve at least one.

Now, the question is: **do I want delegation?**

We saw:
- If both delegate → both play A0 → 5 points
- If only one delegates → both play A1 → 3 points
- If neither delegates → both play A0 → 5 points (assuming coordination)

So if **both delegate**, we both get 5.

If **neither delegates**, we both get 5.

If **only one delegates**, we both get 3.

So **delegation is useful only if both players delegate**.

But if **only one delegates**, we get worse outcome.

So the **risk is high**: if I delegate, and the other doesn’t, I get only 3 instead of 5.

But if I don’t delegate, and they do, I can still play A1 (best response) → get 3.

But if I don’t delegate, and they don’t either → both play A0 → 5.

So **if I don’t delegate, I get 5 if they don’t delegate**, and 3 if they do.

But if I delegate, I get:
- 5 only if they delegate
- 3 if they don’t

So in both cases, if they delegate, I get 5 if I do, 3 if I don’t.

If they don’t delegate:
- I get 5 if I don’t delegate
- I get 3 if I delegate

So **I am strictly better off not delegating, unless I know the other will also delegate**.

But I don’t know.

So **in the absence of coordination**, **delegation is risky**.

But here's the twist: **the mediator can help us coordinate**.

But only if **both of us want to delegate**.

But if I think they won’t, I shouldn’t delegate.

So unless we **coordinate** on delegation, we’ll end up with 3.

But if we coordinate on not delegating, we get 5.

So **the safe strategy is to not delegate**.

But the **only way to get the high payoff of 5** is either:
- Both not delegate → (A0,A0) → 5
- Both delegate → via mediator: both play A0 → 5

But if we use the mediator, we **can** get that.

So **if we can coordinate on both delegating**, we can get 5.

But the **problem is: neither player wants to be the only one to delegate** — because then they get 3.

So **we need a mechanism to coordinate on both delegating**.

But can the **approval process** help?

We have to **approve mediators** first.

Now, suppose I approve both M1 and M2.

Why?

Because:
- I **want** delegation to be possible — so that **if both of us decide to delegate**, we can coordinate on 5.
- But more importantly: **I want to make it safe for the other player to delegate**, by ensuring that a mediator will be present **no matter what**.

But the other player doesn’t care about my approval — they care about whether **a mediator exists**.

In fact, **if I approve both mediators**, then regardless of what the other player does, a mediator is selected.

Now, if I approve only one, and the other player approves nothing, I still get a mediator.

So **it doesn’t matter** for existence.

But what about **influence on behavior**?

The **other player** will decide whether to delegate based on whether they believe a mediator will be present and whether they can coordinate.

But if I approve both, it sends a **signal** that I am **willing to facilitate delegation**, potentially encouraging the other to delegate in return.

But in reality, we are just choosing approvals in a **voting** stage.

But the **final outcome depends on both decisions**.

Now, here’s the key insight:

Suppose I think the other player will delegate.

Then I should delegate too → get 5.

If I think they won’t, then I should not delegate → get 5.

But if I delegate, and they don’t, I get 3 — bad.

So to avoid risk, I might **prefer not to delegate**.

But if I **approve both mediators**, I make delegation **possible**, but I don’t force it.

Now, **what if I disapprove a mediator?**

Suppose I disapprove both.

Then no mediator → no delegation → both play independently → (A0,A0) → 5.

Same as if both delegate.

But worse than that: if I disapprove both, and the other approves both, then the other player might be able to delegate, but I **cannot** — because I disapproved all.

So if I disapprove both, I **cannot delegate**.

But the other player might delegate.

If the other delegates, and I don't, then I will **play A1** (best response) → both play A1 → 3.

But if I had approved a mediator, I could potentially delegate and also get A0 (if both delegate).

But **I don’t control the other player**.

So if I disapprove both, and the other player approves both and delegates, then:

- I cannot delegate (because I disapproved all mediators) → so I must act independently.
- Other player delegates → mediator plays A1 (since only one delegate) → so they play A1.
- I must respond: if I play A0 → get 0; if I play A1 → get 3 → I choose A1.
- So both play A1 → 3.

Whereas if I had approved a mediator, I could have delegated too → then both delegate → 2 delegators → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → 5.

So by disapproving mediators, **I prevent myself from joining a potentially beneficial coordination**.

But if I approve at least one, I **can** delegate and cooperate.

So **to be able to participate in the coordination**, I should **approve at least one**.

But now, **since both mediators are identical**, and **I want to make delegation possible**, I should approve **both**.

Why?

Because:
- I want to **maximize my ability to coordinate**.
- If I approve only one, but the other player dislikes that one, and only approves the other, then both are approved — mediator is selected.
- But if I approve only one, and the other player approves nothing → still, I get a mediator.

So **approving both is not necessary for existence**, but it is **safe**.

But **is there a downside** to approving both?

No — because the mediators are identical.

So **approving both is not worse than approving one**.

And in fact, it **gives me more leeway**: I can delegate regardless of who the other player approves.

So **approving both mediators ensures that I am able to delegate, and the mediator will exist no matter what**.

Moreover, if the other player also approves both, we still have a mediator.

So **approving both is strictly better or equal** than approving one.

And since there is no cost, we should approve both.

But what if we only approve one?

Suppose I approve only M1.

Then, if the other player approves only M2, and we both want to delegate, we can — because a mediator is selected.

But if I disapprove M2, and the other player approves M2, it’s still fine — the mediator is selected.

But the **only risk** is if the other player disapproves all, but then I still get M1.

So in **all scenarios**, as long as I approve at least one, a mediator exists.

But **if I disapprove both**, then **no mediator** → no delegation.

And if the other player delegates, I **cannot** follow → I get 3 if I play A1.

Whereas if I had approved one, I could have delegated and avoided that.

So by disapproving both, I **lose the opportunity** to get 5 in a case where the other delegates.

But if the other doesn’t delegate, I get 5 anyway.

So the **only case where disapproving both is worse** is when the other delegates and I don't.

Then I get 3 instead of 5.

But if I approve at least one, I can delegate and get 5.

So **to avoid that loss, I should approve at least one**.

But since both mediators are identical, and I have no reason to prefer one over the other, I should **approve both**.

Because:
- It doesn’t hurt me.
- It guarantees delegation is possible.
- It gives me the chance to coordinate.

And in the worst case, if I approve both and the other player doesn’t delegate, I can still play independently and get 5.

So approving both **never harms me**, and **can only help** in the case where we both delegate.

And **there is no cost to approving both**.

Therefore, **I should approve both mediators**.

---

### **Final Decision: Approve both**

- M1: approved
- M2: approved

Because they have identical behavior, so no difference in outcome.

And approving both ensures the mediator exists and gives me the ability to delegate.

Thus, maximizing my chance to achieve the best outcome.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1**    | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

This is a variant of a coordination game with a twist: there's an incentive to coordinate on (A0, A0), but if you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get nothing.

Note:
- (A0, A0): mutual reward (5,5)
- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 3
- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3, Player 2 gets 0
- (A1, A1): both get 3

So, the best outcome for you (Player 1) is (A0, A0) with 5 points.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Twists**

Now, we can **delegate** our move to a mediator.

But first, there's an **approval voting process** to decide which mediator appears in the game.

There are **two proposed mediators**, both proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 respectively — but they are **identical in behavior**:

> **Mediator M1 (proposed by P1):**
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

> **Mediator M2 (proposed by P2):**
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ So **M1 and M2 are functionally identical**.

They both:
- Play A1 when **only one** player delegates to them.
- Play A0 when **both** players delegate to them.

So the mediator's behavior depends only on **how many players delegate to it**, not which mediator it is.

Therefore, **their behavior is identical**.

So, from a strategic standpoint, **M1 and M2 are indistinguishable in effect**, even though they were proposed by different players.

---

### **Step 3: What Does Delegation Mean?**

You can:
- **Act independently**: choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1.
- **Delegate to a mediator**: let the mediator choose your action based on how many total players (you and the other player) delegate to it.

Important: The **mediator is chosen via approval voting**, and the **winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum approvals**.

But crucially: **Both mediators behave identically**.

So whether M1 or M2 wins (or if both are approved), the behavior of the mediator in the game will be the same.

---

### **Step 4: Strategic Implication of Approval Voting**

You are asked to **approve or disapprove each mediator**.

You are trying to **maximize your own expected points**.

Let’s consider:

- You want the **mediator's behavior** to be favorable to you.
- But **since both mediators behave identically**, your **approval decision alone does not affect the behavior** of the final mediator.

But here’s the catch: the **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if, for example, you approve only M1, and the other player approves only M1, then M1 wins (with 100% chance).

But if you approve both M1 and M2, and the other player approves both, then both have 2 approvals → max is 2 → winner is chosen at random between them, but **since they behave the same**, it makes no difference.

Now, what determines **whether a mediator is available**?

- Only mediators with **approvals** can be chosen.
- The winner is among the **most approved**.
- If all mediators have equal approval counts, the random selection among them is irrelevant (due to identical behavior).

Therefore:

→ It does **not matter** which mediator wins, since both behave the same.

→ Your expected payoff **does not depend on which mediator wins**, only on whether **any mediator is chosen** (i.e., whether there is at least one approved mediator with ≥1 vote), and importantly, on **how delegation is coordinated**.

But actually — **you can still choose whether to delegate to a mediator or not**, even if one is selected.

But here's a key detail: **the mediator is selected BEFORE** the players decide whether to delegate.

So the mechanism is:

1. Players approve mediators (you vote on M1 and M2).
2. The winner is selected at random among those with max approvals.
3. Then, each player chooses to either:
   - Act independently, or
   - Delegate to the selected mediator.

So the selected mediator has a known behavior rule.

But here’s the important point: **you don’t know which mediator will be selected** — but since both behave identically, it doesn’t matter.

So your decision to approve a mediator only determines whether it’s **eligible** to be selected.

But because the mediator behavior is the same, **you want the mediator to be present** — because it gives you strategic flexibility.

Wait — could it be better to **not approve a mediator** to block it?

But **both mediators are identical**, so blocking one doesn’t matter.

Also, if you approve **only one**, and the other player approves **only the other**, then:
- M1 has 1 vote, M2 has 1 vote → both have max approval → winner is selected at random → but again, same behavior.

So in all cases, the **behavior of the selected mediator is the same** regardless of which one is picked.

Therefore, **you only care about whether there is at least one approved mediator** — because if **no mediator is approved**, then **delegation is impossible**, and you are forced to act independently.

But if at least one mediator is approved, the game proceeds with a mediator (whose behavior is fixed: A1 if one player delegates, A0 if both delegate), and then you can choose to delegate or not.

But the **mediator’s action depends on how many players delegate to it**.

So if you **approve both**, then the mediator is available regardless of what the other player does.

If you **approve only one**, and the other player approves none, then no mediator is selected → delegation is not possible.

So to **ensure** the mediator is available, you should **approve at least one**.

But could there be a downside?

Suppose you approve both, but **you are better off not having a mediator** — but that’s not true. Let’s analyze.

---

### **Step 5: What Is the Role of the Mediator?**

Suppose the **selected mediator** is available.

Then each player independently chooses: 
- Delegate to it, or
- Act independently.

But the **mediator plays based on how many players delegate**, not based on their intentions.

Specifically:

- If *only one* player delegates → mediator plays A1
- If *both* players delegate → mediator plays A0

So the **outcome depends on joint delegation decisions**.

Now, you are trying to maximize your expected payoff.

Let’s consider possible scenarios.

---

### **Step 6: Analyze Strategic Implications**

Let’s assume the mediator is selected (i.e., at least one is approved → we assume we approve at least one, to make delegation possible).

Let’s suppose **you and the other player each decide whether to delegate or act independently**.

But the mediator only applies **if you delegate**.

So the **action you take** is:
- If you delegate → the mediator plays A1 if only one player delegates, A0 if both do.
- If you act independently → you choose a probability over A0 and A1.

But now we have a **complex coordination problem**: the outcome depends on both your choice and the other player’s.

But here's a way to approach it: **what if you could coordinate with the other player?**

But you don’t know what they’ll do.

However, recall that the **mediator chooses based on delegation count**.

So here’s a **key idea**:

Suppose you **both delegate to the mediator**.

→ Then **2 players delegate** → mediator plays **A0**

→ So both players end up playing **A0**

→ You get **5 points**

That’s the **best possible outcome**.

If **only one delegates**, mediator plays **A1** → so the delegating player plays A1, the independent player (if acting) might play something else.

But if **only one delegates**, and the other acts independently, it’s messy.

But let’s suppose that **if both players delegate**, they both get A0 → which gives you 5.

But can you **guarantee** that?

Only if you can **coordinate** on both delegating.

But since you don't know what the other player will do, you can only **strategically choose** whether to delegate or not.

But suppose the **mediator behavior is known** and the **outcome of both delegating is A0 for both** → giving you 5.

If both act independently, you could play something like a mixed strategy in the original game.

Let’s analyze **what the best equilibrium in the original game is**.

---

### **Step 7: Best Outcome in Original Game (No Delegation)**

In the original game, what is the optimal strategy if no mediators are available?

Let’s find Nash equilibria.

- (A0, A0): (5,5) — is this a NE?
  - If you deviate to A1, you get 3 < 5 → no incentive.
  - So yes, (A0, A0) is a pure NE.

- (A1, A1): (3,3)
  - If you deviate to A0, you get 0 < 3 → no incentive → also a NE.

- (A0, A1): (0,3)
  - You get 0 — you would prefer to play A1 → get 3 → so not equilibrium.

- (A1, A0): (3,0)
  - You get 3 — but the other player gets 0, so they want to switch to A1 → not equilibrium.

So two pure NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

(A0, A0) gives you 5, (A1, A1) gives you 3.

So **if you can coordinate on (A0, A0)**, you get 5.

But if not, you might end up on (A1, A1), only getting 3.

So best is **to coordinate on A0**.

But with delegation, **you can force a coordination on A0** — **if both delegate**, the mediator plays **A0** for both.

So both playing A0.

So **if both players delegate, you both get 5**.

Now, can any rational player **want to commit to delegating**?

Yes — because:

- If you delegate, and the other player delegates → you get 5.
- If you delegate, and the other **does not delegate** → then only **one** player delegates → mediator plays **A1**.

So you get **3 points**, but the other player is acting independently.

But if the other player chooses to act independently, they might choose A0 or A1.

But you don’t know.

But **if the other player is also rational, and both want to get 5**, they might both be willing to delegate — if they expect the other to also delegate.

This is similar to a **cheap talk coordination device**.

Now, if both players can **commit to delegating** to the mediator, and they **both delegate**, then **both get 5**.

But what if one delegates and the other doesn't?

Then mediator plays A1 → you get 3.

But if you act independently and the other delegates, you still get to choose your action.

But it’s complex.

But now back to **your decision**: **which mediators to approve**.

Since **M1 and M2 behave identically**, **approving both or one or none** affects whether the mediator is available.

You want the mediator to be available, because it gives you the **option to coordinate on A0**.

If no mediator is available, then you're stuck with the original game.

In the original game, you can **still** try to coordinate on A0.

But due to the risk of (A1, A1) (3 points), and (A0, A1) (0 points), it's risky.

But **having the mediator gives you a way to coordinate on A0** — **if both commit**.

So **you want the mediator to be available**.

Therefore, you should **approve at least one**.

But **what if you approve only one**?

Then:
- If the other player approves only the **other one**, then **neither has the mediator**? No.

Let’s clarify:

Approval voting:
- You vote on M1 and M2.
- The **most approved** mediators are selected.
- Winner is chosen **uniformly at random** from the most approved.

So if you approve **only M1**, and the other player approves **only M2**, then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 1 approval
- Both are tied for max → so **winner is selected at random**, but **either way, the behavior is the same**.

So **mediator is available**.

Even if only one of you approves a mediator, as long as **at least one** is approved by **you or the other**, the mediator may be available.

But what if **neither** approves a mediator?

Then no mediator is selected → delegation impossible.

So you must **approve at least one** to **ensure** the possibility of delegation.

But: **you are trying to maximize your expected payoff**, possibly with risk of worse outcomes if the other player doesn’t cooperate.

But here’s a **crucial insight**:

- If you **do not approve any mediator**, and the other player does **not** approve any mediator either → no mediator → you play original game → you risk getting only 3 points (if both play A1), or 5 if you coordinate.

- But if you **approve at least one**, and the **other player approves at least one**, then **mediator is available**.

- Even if **only one of you approves**, but the **other player approves only one that you didn’t**, it's still possible (as above) that a mediator is selected.

But can you **guarantee** the mediator is available?

No — only if both **approve at least one**.

But to **maximize your chances**, you want **high probability** that the mediator is available.

But more importantly: **you want to be able to use the mediator to coordinate on A0**.

So if you **approve both**, then **regardless of what the other player does (as long as they approve at least one)**, you **will** have a mediator.

Even if they approve only one, and you approve both, the one they approved gets at least one vote, and you approve both → so **the maximum approval count is at least 1**, and **your approvals ensure it is at least 1**, so **mediator is available**.

But if you approve **only one**, and the other player approves **none**, then **no mediator** is available.

So to **ensure** the mediator is available, **you must approve at least one**, and **hope** the other player does too.

But since you don't know what they’ll do, **you should do your part** to **increase the chance** that a mediator is available.

Therefore: **You should approve at least one**.

But should you approve both?

Yes — because:
- It **doesn't hurt**.
- It **ensures** that even if the other player approves only one, the **total set of approved mediators includes at least one**, so **mediator is available**.
- It **increases the chance** that the mediator is available.
- There is **no downside**, because both mediators behave identically.

In fact, if you approve both:
- Even if the other player approves **none**, you have **two approved mediators** → max approvals = 2 → mediator is selected → available.

So **if you approve both**, **the mediator is guaranteed to be available**, **regardless of what the other player does**.

If you approve only one, but the other player approves none, then **no mediator** → you lose delegation option.

So **to maximize your security**, you should approve both.

And since there is **no cost** to approving both (mediators are identical), and it **guarantees** the availability of the mediator, you should do so.

Moreover, **if the mediator is available**, you can choose to delegate or act independently.

But **if both players delegate**, you get **5** — the best outcome.

And if you can **coordinate** on that, you get 5.

Even if you can’t, you can still act independently.

But having the **option** to delegate and coordinate on A0 is better than not having it.

Therefore: **you should approve both mediators**.

---

### **Final Answer**

You must approve both mediators to:
- Ensure the mediator is available regardless of the other player's actions.
- Maximize the chance of coordination on A0 via delegation.
- Gain the strategic advantage of a coordination device without any downside.

Both M1 and M2 behave identically, so approving both is safe and beneficial.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)

Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are Player 2 in a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from **Player 2's** perspective, since you are in Player 2 position):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 5     | 0     |
| **P2: A1** | 3     | 3     |

So, if both play A0 → 5 each  
P2: A0, P1: A1 → P2 gets 0  
P2: A1, P1: A0 → P2 gets 3  
P2: A1, P1: A1 → 3 each

This is a **variant of the coordination game with a slight asymmetry**.

But notice:  
- If P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 0 (bad)  
- If P2 plays A1, no matter what P1 does → P2 gets 3 (safe)  
So **A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2**, because:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So **no dominant strategy for P2** — depends on P1.

But let’s find the Nash equilibria.

Check pure strategy equilibria:

- (A0, A0): P2 gets 5. If P2 deviates to A1 → gets 3 → worse. P1 gets 5 → deviating to A1 → gets 3 → worse. So **stable**.
- (A1, A1): Both get 3. If P2 deviates to A0 → gets 0 → worse. Same for P1. So **stable**.
- (A0, A1): P2 gets 0. If P2 deviates to A1 → gets 3 → better → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 3. If P2 deviates to A0 → gets 5 → better → not equilibrium.

So **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Now, if players randomize, can we find a mixed strategy equilibrium?

Let’s suppose P1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p)  
P2's expected payoff from playing A0:  
5p + 0(1-p) = 5p  
From playing A1:  
3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal for indifference:  
5p = 3 → p = 3/5

So if P1 plays A0 with 3/5, P2 is indifferent → can play any mix.  
Similarly, if P2 plays A0 with q, P1's payoff:

From A0: 5q + 3(1-q) = 5q + 3 - 3q = 2q + 3  
From A1: 0q + 3(1-q) = 3 - 3q

Set equal:  
2q + 3 = 3 - 3q → 2q + 3q = 0 → 5q = 0 → q = 0

So the only symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium is when P2 plays A0 with 0, A1 with 1, and P1 plays A0 with 3/5.

But actually, the mixed strategy equilibrium is:
- P1 plays A0 with 3/5, A1 with 2/5
- P2 plays A1 with 1 (i.e., pure A1) — because then P1 is indifferent only if p=3/5

Wait, in this case, P2’s best response to P1 playing p=3/5 is to be indifferent, so can mix. But since A1 gives P2 3 regardless, and A0 gives 5p = 3 when p=3/5, so yes, P2 is indifferent.

So P2 can mix, but playing A1 with 1 (pure A1) is also a best response.

But let's not get bogged down.

Key insight:  
- In pure strategy, (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are both equilibria.
- The (A1,A1) outcome gives both players 3.
- The (A0,A0) outcome gives both 5 — better for both.
- But (A0,A0) is risky: if one player thinks the other will play A1, and they play A0, they get 0.
- So (A1,A1) is a safe equilibrium with guaranteed 3.

Now — we are the **player who wants to maximize our own points**.

But now comes the **twist**: we can **delegate our move to a mediator**, but **only after an approval vote** to select the winning mediator.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Delegation System**

- There are two mediators proposed:
  - **M1**: Proposed by Player 1
  - **M2**: Proposed by Player 2

But both **have identical behaviors**:

> **M1 & M2**:  
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So both mediators behave **exactly the same**.

Therefore, from a **strategic behavior standpoint**, M1 and M2 are identical.

But we are to **approve** or **disapprove** of the mediators **before** the approval voting.

And the **winning mediator** is picked **uniform at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.

So our approval decision affects the **probability** that the winning mediator is M1 or M2.

But since both behave identically, **it doesn't matter which one wins** — the outcome is the same.

So our personal gain depends **only on whether we delegate**, and **how many players delegate**, not which mediator is chosen.

Therefore, **the behavior of the mediator is the same for M1 and M2**, so we have **no incentive to prefer one over the other**.

But we are asked to **approve or disapprove** of each.

---

### **Step 3: Strategic Considerations — Should We Delegate?**

We are **Player 2**, and we care about **maximizing our own expected payoff**.

We can:
- Act independently
- Delegate to a mediator (if one exists)

But the mediator behavior depends on **how many players** delegate.

Let’s analyze the possibilities.

Let’s define:
- Let’s suppose we (Player 2) decide to **delegate**.
- The other player (Player 1) can also choose to delegate or not.

So total delegation counts:
- 0: neither delegates → both play independently
- 1: one delegates → the mediator plays A1
- 2: both delegate → mediator plays A0

Now, what do we get in each case?

Let’s consider **what we want**.

Our goal: **maximize our own expected points**.

Let’s compute what we get in each case **for different delegation patterns**.

Assume that **we** will **delegate** (we are considering this option); we’ll compare to not delegating.

But first, **what happens if we delegate**?

The mediator (M1 or M2) will play:
- A1 if **only one** delegates
- A0 if **both** delegate

So:
- **Case 1: We delegate, Player 1 does not** → only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → we play A1 → we get:
  - Our action: A1
  - P1’s action: ?, since P1 is not delegating → P1 will play based on their own strategy

Wait — here’s a critical point.

When a player delegates, the mediator plays **for them**, using the rule based on number of delegations.

But if a player **does not delegate**, they **choose their own action** — but **based on what?**

Ah — this is important.

The game says:
- "You can also choose to act independently."
- And "the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions" — but now with delegation.

So it’s not clear **how** non-delegating players choose their action.

But in the original game, we can play a **mixed strategy** — i.e., pick a probability for A0 and A1.

But now with delegation, the decision is more complex.

To make progress, we must assume a **consistent decision rule** for non-delegating players.

Let’s assume that **non-delegating players** will act **rationally**, trying to maximize their own payoff, based on expectations of others.

But we are designing a strategy.

Alternatively, we can assume that **delegation is a commitment** to delegate to a fixed mediator, and that the mediator only acts when someone delegates.

But the **key assumption** is: **if a player does not delegate, they can choose their own action (possibly mixed)**.

But we must **decide** whether to approve mediators, and that decision **affects the likelihood** that the mediator is even selected.

But **we do not know** how many people will delegate — that depends on the approval votes.

This is a **meta-game**.

We are to **approve or disapprove** M1 and M2 **before** any delegation happens.

Then, the winning mediator is chosen (uniform at random from those with max approvals).

Then, players decide — **whether to delegate** — and if so, the mediator will act.

Then, the game is played.

So we must **predict** how others will behave, and what payoff we get depending on the outcome.

### Let's consider the implications of our approval.

But wait — **we are only selecting the mediator**; the **delegation decision** is made later by each player, based on whether a mediator exists.

But crucially, if no mediator is selected (because no one approves it), then **delegation is not possible**, and we must play independently.

So, if **we** approve **only one** of the mediators, say M1, and **Player 1** approves only M2, then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 1 approval
- Max approvals: 1
- So winner is selected **uniform at random** between M1 and M2 → each has 50% chance
- Since both behave identically, outcome is same.

But if **we approve both**, and Player 1 approves both, then both have 2 approvals → max is 2 → winner picked randomly from both → same outcome.

But if **we approve both**, and Player 1 approves **only M1**, then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

But since both mediators behave identically, the outcome **only depends on whether the mediator exists**, not which one.

So **the behavior depends only on the number of approvals** **for mediators with max approvals**?

No — because if a mediator is not selected, it doesn't exist.

So if only M1 is approved by us, and Player 1 approves M1, then M1 is selected — mediator available.

If only M1 is approved by us, and Player 1 approves M2, then both have 1 approval → winner is chosen uniformly at random — **each has 50% chance of being selected**.

So in that case, **the mediator exists with 100% probability**, just we don't know which one (but both behave the same).

So **in all cases**, as long as **at least one mediator is approved**, the **winning mediator exists** with probability 1 → and it will play:
- A1 if only 1 player delegates
- A0 if both delegate

And since both M1 and M2 do the same, it doesn’t matter.

The **only thing** that matters is: **is delegation possible?**

Delegation is possible **only if a mediator is selected**, which happens as long as **at least one mediator is approved**.

But if **no one approves any mediator**, then no mediator is selected → delegation is not available → both players must act independently.

So, to maximize our **chance of having a mediator**, we **should approve both**.

But why?

Because:
- If we disapprove one, say M2, then even if Player 1 approves M2, M2 is not approved by us → so if Player 1 approves only M2, and we approve only M1, then:
  - M1: 1 approval (ours)
  - M2: 1 approval (Player 1's)
  - So both are approved → max = 1 → winner chosen randomly → mediator exists → good.

But if we disapprove **both**, and Player 1 approves both, then:
- M1: 1 approval (Player 1)
- M2: 1 approval (Player 1)
- So both have 1 → winner chosen randomly → mediator exists.

But if **we disapprove both**, and **Player 1 approves both**, then both still get 1 approval → max is 1 → winner chosen → mediator exists.

But if **we disapprove both**, and **Player 1 approves neither**, then no mediator is approved → no mediator selected → delegation impossible.

But we are the **only** one who can influence the outcome by our own approvals.

So **by disapproving both**, we **risk** that **no mediator is approved** — if Player 1 approves neither, then no mediator.

But if we approve **at least one**, then **no matter what Player 1 does**, the mediator **might be selected**.

Let’s compute the risk.

Our goal: **maximize our expected points**.

We must consider:
- The choice to delegate or not
- But that is made **after** the mediator is chosen.

So if **no mediator is selected**, then **we cannot delegate**, so we **must** play independently.

But if a mediator is selected, we **can** delegate.

But **do we want to delegate**?

That depends on what happens.

Let’s suppose that **a mediator exists**.

Then:
- If **only one player delegates** (say only we delegate), then mediator plays A1 → we play A1
- If **both delegate**, mediator plays A0 → we play A0

Now, what is the **best** strategy for us?

We want to **maximize our own payoff**.

Let’s consider **what we should do** if a mediator exists.

Suppose we are **considering delegating**.

Then:
- If **only we delegate** → mediator plays A1 → we get 3 points (we play A1), and Player 1 plays independently (unknown)

Wait — **player 1’s action** matters.

If we delegate:
- Our action is set by mediator: A1 (if one delegate) or A0 (if two delegates)

But **Player 1’s action** depends on whether they delegate or not.

Case 1: We delegate. Player 1 does not delegate.

→ Then:
- We play: A1 (since only 1 delegate)
- Player 1 plays: ??? → based on their own choice

To find our payoff, we need to know what P1 will do.

But we don’t know.

So we must **assume rationality**.

But here's a better approach:

Since both mediators behave identically, and we want to maximize our own points, and **we don’t want to risk no mediator being available**, we should **approve both**.

Why?

Because:
- If we approve **only one mediator**, say M1, and Player 1 approves only M2, then both get 1 approval → so one is selected at random → mediator exists → okay.
- But if we approve **only M1**, and Player 1 approves **only M1**, then M1 has 2 → M1 wins → good.
- But if we approve **only M1**, and Player 1 approves **nothing**, then M1 has 1, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → mediator exists.

But if **we approve neither**, and Player 1 approves **neither**, then **no mediator** — delegation impossible → we must play independently.

And we might be worse off.

But if **we approve both**, then **no matter what Player 1 does**:
- If Player 1 approves at least one, then at least one mediator has 1 or 2 approval → max is at least 1 → mediator exists.
- Only if Player 1 approves **neither**, and we approve **neither**, then no mediator.

But if we approve **both**, then **even if Player 1 approves nothing**, we have **2 approvals for M1**, 2 for M2 → max = 2 → so one of them is selected → **mediator exists**.

So **by approving both mediators**, we **guarantee** that a mediator will be selected, **regardless of what Player 1 does**.

If we approve only one, and Player 1 approves neither, then that one has only 1 approval — but max = 1 → winner chosen → mediator still exists.

Wait — if **we approve only M1**, and Player 1 approves nothing, then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 0

So max = 1 → M1 is selected — mediator exists.

So in fact, as long as **at least one person approves at least one mediator**, a mediator is selected.

The **only way** for **no mediator** to be selected is if **everyone approves no mediator** — i.e., **both players approve no mediator**.

Therefore, **by approving at least one mediator**, we **do not guarantee** that the mediator exists — **we only guarantee it if the other player does not vote for anyone**.

Wait — no:

If we approve M1, then **even if Player 1 approves nothing**, M1 has 1 approval → so max = 1 → M1 is selected → mediator exists.

Only if **we approve nothing** AND **Player 1 approves nothing**, then no mediator.

Therefore, **as long as we approve at least one mediator, a mediator will exist**, no matter what Player 1 does.

Similarly, if Player 1 approves at least one, then mediator exists, even if we approve nothing.

So **the only case where no mediator is selected is when both players approve no mediator**.

Therefore, **to avoid the risk of no mediator**, we should **approve at least one**.

But since **both mediators are identical**, approving **one** or **both** doesn't matter — the outcome is the same.

So we might as well approve **both**, because:
- It doesn’t hurt
- It ensures that even if Player 1 approves only one, we have both approved → so max approval is higher → might help if there were differences, but there aren’t

But **if we approve both**, does that **increase** the chance that a mediator exists?

No — as long as either player approves at least one, mediator exists.

But **by approving both**, we **prevent** the chance of no mediator.

But if we approve one, we **already prevent** that — as long as we approve at least one, **a mediator exists**.

So **approving one is sufficient**.

But why approve both?

Because if we appoint only one, and Player 1 appoints only the other, then both mediators have 1 approval → so winner is chosen randomly → same as if both were approved.

But if we approve both, then even if Player 1 approves only one, our approvals give both mediators at least 1 → so both have at least 1 → so both are in contention → winner picked at random → same outcome.

So no difference.

But **there’s a deeper consideration**.

Suppose that **delegation is beneficial** for us.

Then **we want to be able to delegate**.

And since a mediator will exist **as long as we approve at least one**, we **must approve at least one**.

But since **both are identical**, we might as well approve **both**, to maximize the chance that a mediator is selected — but it’s already guaranteed if we approve any.

Wait — no: if we approve **nothing**, then only if Player 1 approves **something**, mediator exists.

But we don’t know what Player 1 will do.

So if we approve **nothing**, then:
- If Player 1 approves nothing → no mediator
- If Player 1 approves something → mediator exists

So **we are at risk** of having no mediator.

But if we **approve at least one**, then **no matter what Player 1 does**, mediator exists.

Therefore, to **guarantee** that delegation is possible, we should **approve at least one**.

So in our interest: **we should approve at least one**.

Now, should we approve **both**?

Since both are identical, and approving both doesn’t reduce our payoff, and only increases the chance that the mediator is “stronger” in the approval vote (but it doesn’t matter), and it doesn’t decrease our payoff, we should approve both.

Moreover, suppose that both players follow this logic.

But note: we are **Player 2**, and **we are told** that "You are playing in the position of Player 2".

But **Player 1** is the other player.

But there’s no indication that Player 1 will be cooperating or adversarial.

But since we only care about **our own payoff**, and **we cannot control Player 1's vote**, the only way to **maximize our security** is to **approve both mediators**.

Because:
- If we approve only one, and Player 1 approves only the other, then both have 1 → winner chosen randomly → mediator exists → fine.
- If we approve only one, and Player 1 approves only that, then it has 2 → wins → fine.
- Only if we approve **nothing**, and Player 1 approves **nothing**, then no mediator.

But we don’t want that risk.

So **approve at least one**.

But since **both are equally good**, and **approving both has no downside**, and **ensures maximum flexibility**, we should **approve both**.

Moreover, suppose that if multiple mediators have same max approval, winner is chosen randomly.

But since they are identical, it doesn’t matter.

So **no reason not to approve both**.

### **But wait — is delegation beneficial?**

We must ask: **should we delegate?**

Suppose a mediator exists.

Then, we can **choose to delegate or not**.

But if we don't delegate, we act independently.

So we must decide: **what is better — to delegate or not?**

Let’s suppose we **can delegate**, and a mediator is in place.

Then, we can choose:
- Delegate: our action is set by mediator (A1 if only one delegate, A0 if both)
- Or not delegate: we choose our own action

So we want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

So we should **choose the best option**.

Let’s suppose Player 1 is also deciding.

But to analyze, assume **both players are rational**.

Let’s consider possible outcomes.

Suppose **both players delegate**.

Then:
- Mediator plays A0 (since 2 delegates)
- So both play A0
- Payoff: 5 each

Suppose **only we delegate**, Player 1 does not.

Then:
- Mediator plays A1
- So we play A1
- Player 1 plays some action — say P1 plays A0 with q, A1 with 1-q

Our payoff:
- If P1 plays A0 → we play A1, P1 plays A0 → we get 3
- If P1 plays A1 → we play A1, P1 plays A1 → we get 3
- So **we get 3 no matter what** P1 does

If **only Player 1 delegates**, then mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- Then we play independently
- If we play A0 → and P1 plays A1 → we get 0
- If we play A1 → we get 3
- So we would play A1 (dominant strategy)

So if only P1 delegates, P1 plays A1, we play A1 → we get 3

Now, back to our decision: **if a mediator exists, should we delegate?**

Let’s compare:

Case A: We **do not delegate** → we act independently.

Then:
- If Player 1 delegates → then Player 1 plays A1 (since only one delegate) → then we can choose to play A1 (best response, get 3)
- If Player 1 does not delegate → then both act independently.

But in the independent case, both play A0 with some probability.

But from earlier, (A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium → both play A1 → get 3.

(A0,A0) also: both get 5.

But it's risky.

But rational players might coordinate on (A1,A1) because it's safe.

But if both players are risk-averse about coordination failure, they might play A1.

But let’s suppose they both play A1 → get 3.

But if they could coordinate on (A0,A0), they get 5 each — better.

But if one thinks the other will play A0, and they play A0, they get 5.

But if they play A1 and other plays A0, they get 3.

But in the absence of coordination, (A1,A1) is safe.

So likely, if no delegation, both play A1 → get 3.

Now, back to our case.

If a mediator exists:

- If **we delegate**, and Player 1 delegates → both play A0 → we get 5
- If **we delegate**, and Player 1 does not → we play A1 → we get 3 (as shown)
- If **we do not delegate**, and Player 1 delegates → P1 plays A1 → we play A1 → get 3
- If **we do not delegate**, and P1 does not delegate → both play A1 → get 3

So now, compare:
- If we **delegate**, and we expect Player 1 to delegate → we get 5
- But if Player 1 does not delegate → we get 3
- If we **do not delegate**, we get 3 in all cases, or possibly more if we can coordinate on A0.

But in the no-delegation case, can we get 5?

Only if both play A0 → which requires **coordination**.

But if Player 1 is rational, and assumes we play A1, they might play A1.

But if Player 1 expects us to play A0, they might play A0.

But without communication, it's hard.

But if **both delegate**, we **must** both play A0 → and get 5.

So **delegation enables coordination on (A0,A0)**.

In fact, if **both delegate**, regardless of their incentives, they both play A0 → get 5.

So **if both delegate**, we get 5.

But if we **don't delegate**, we get only 3 (assuming they play A1).

So **delegation is better**, if we believe **both will delegate**.

But will they?

We can consider a **commitment device**.

The mediator offers **a way to commit to A0 when both delegate**.

Now, if **we delegate**, we are forced to play A0 **only if both delegate**.

But if only we delegate, we play A1.

So if we delegate, we are **willing to play A1 if only we delegate**, but **A0 if both delegate**.

But if we delegate, and **Player 1 also delegates**, we both get 5.

But if only we delegate, we get 3.

But if we don't delegate, and Player 1 delegates, we can play A1 → get 3.

Same.

But if both don't delegate, we get 3.

So the only scenario where delegation gives us more is **if both delegate**, and we get 5 instead of 3.

So **we get 2 extra points if both delegate**.

Now, **does delegation induce both to delegate?**

Yes.

Because if both delegate, they get 5 each — better than 3.

And no incentive to deviate: if one deviates from delegation, they get 3 instead of 5.

So (both delegate) is an equilibrium.

Moreover, if both delegate, outcome is (A0,A0) → 5 each.

Whereas without delegation, expected payoff is only 3.

Therefore, **delegation allows coordination on the efficient outcome (A0,A0)**.

Therefore, **we want to delegate**, **if we believe the other player will too**.

And since the mediator enables this, we **should want the mediator to exist**.

In fact, **if a mediator exists**, and **both players prefer to delegate**, then both will delegate → (A0,A0) → we get 5.

But if we do **not approve any mediator**, then no mediator → we can’t coordinate → likely get only 3.

So **we gain by having a mediator**.

Therefore, **we should approve mediators to **enable** this coordination.

Moreover, as established, **as long as we approve at least one**, a mediator exists.

But to be safe, and since **both are identical**, we should approve **both**.

No downside.

Even if Player 1 approves only one, we approve both → both have at least one → so both are in the running → winner chosen randomly → mediator exists → good.

And **only if we approve nothing** do we risk no mediator.

So **we must approve at least one**.

And **we should approve both**.

### ✅ Final Decision:

Approve **both** mediators.

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game
From my perspective (Player 2), the payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

This is a coordination game where (A0, A0) gives both players 5 points - the best mutual outcome.

## Step 2: Analyze Mediator 1 (M1)

**If both delegate to M1:** Plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → Both get 5 ✓

**If only I delegate to M1:** Plays A1 for me → Player 1's best response is A1 → (A1, A1) → Both get 3

**If only Player 1 delegates to M1:** Plays A1 for Player 1 → My best response is A1 → (A1, A1) → Both get 3

**If neither delegates:** Back to base coordination game → hopefully (A0, A0) for 5 each

**Problem with M1:** Creates a coordination problem in the delegation decision itself. If players mismatch their delegation choices, both only get 3 instead of 5.

## Step 3: Analyze Mediator 2 (M2)

**If both delegate to M2:** Plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → Both get 5 ✓

**If only I delegate to M2:** Plays A0 for me → Player 1's best response to my A0 is A0 (gets 5 vs 3) → (A0, A0) → Both get 5 ✓

**If only Player 1 delegates to M2:** Plays A0 for Player 1 → My best response to their A0 is A0 (I get 5 vs 3) → (A0, A0) → Both get 5 ✓

**If neither delegates:** Back to base game → hopefully (A0, A0) for 5 each ✓

**Key insight:** M2 always leads to (A0, A0) → (5, 5) regardless of delegation choices! It eliminates all coordination risk.

## Step 4: Compare mediators

M2 strictly dominates M1 because:
- M2 guarantees the optimal outcome (5, 5) in ALL scenarios
- M1 risks the suboptimal outcome (3, 3) if delegation choices don't match
- This is true for BOTH players

## Step 5: Approval decision

Since M2 is strictly better, I should only approve M2. This maximizes the probability that M2 is selected (either outright if Player 1 also approves it, or at worst 50/50 if Player 1 only approves M1).

```json
{"M1": false, "M2": true}

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating the mediator's rules. You are Player 2.

### 16. Step 1: Analyze the Payoff Matrix
The original actions are **A0** and **A1**. **A2** represents delegating to the mediator.

*   **A0 vs A0**: Both get **5**.
*   **A0 vs A1**: Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets **3**.
*   **A1 vs A0**: Player 1 gets 3, Player 2 gets **0**.
*   **A1 vs A1**: Both get **3**.

Now, consider the mediator (**A2**):
*   **If only Player 2 delegates (A2)**: The mediator plays A1 for P2.
    *   If P1 plays A0: Action pair (A0, A1) $\rightarrow$ P1 gets 0, P2 gets **3**.
    *   If P1 plays A1: Action pair (A1, A1) $\rightarrow$ P1 gets 3, P2 gets **3**.
*   **If only Player 1 delegates (A2)**: The mediator plays A1 for P1.
    *   If P2 plays A0: Action pair (A1, A0) $\rightarrow$ P1 gets 3, P2 gets **0**.
    *   If P2 plays A1: Action pair (A1, A1) $\rightarrow$ P1 gets 3, P2 gets **3**.
*   **If both delegate (A2, A2)**: The mediator plays A0 for both.
    *   Action pair (A0, A0) $\rightarrow$ Both get **5**.

### 17. Step 2: Full Payoff Table for Player 2 (Column Player)
| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A0** | 5 | 3 | 3 |
| **A1** | 0 | 3 | 3 |
| **A2** | 0 | 3 | 5 |

### 18. Step 3: Strategy Selection
*   **Dominance Analysis**: For Player 2, action **A2** weakly dominates **A1**. In every scenario (P1 choosing A0, A1, or A2), A2 yields a payoff equal to or greater than A1 (3 $\ge$ 3, 3 $\ge$ 3, and 5 $\ge$ 3). Therefore, a rational player will never prefer A1 over A2.
*   **Nash Equilibria**:
    1.  **(A0, A0)**: Payoff (5, 5). If either deviates to A2, their payoff drops from 5 to 3.
    2.  **(A2, A2)**: Payoff (5, 5). If either deviates to A1, their payoff drops from 5 to 3. If they deviate to A0, it drops from 5 to 0.
*   **Risk Analysis**: While both (A0, A0) and (A2, A2) result in the maximum payoff of 5, A0 is highly risky. If you play A0 and the other player does not, your payoff drops to 0. If you play A2 and the other player does not, your payoff is guaranteed to be at least 3. Action A2 is a safer coordination mechanism.

### 19. Step 4: Final Conclusion
The mediator was specifically designed to facilitate coordination on the (5, 5) outcome safely. Since A2 provides the same upside as A0 with a much higher safety floor (3 vs 0), it is the most robust rational choice for both players.

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5, they get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, they get 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, they get 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, they get 3

This game has a coordination problem:
- (A0, A0) is the best outcome for both players (5 points each)
- (A1, A1) is a "safe" outcome (3 points each)
- But if we miscoordinate, one player gets 0

Without coordination, there's risk of getting the worst outcome (0 points).

## Step 2: Analyze the mediators

**M1 (my proposal):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**M2 (other player's proposal):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1  
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

Both mediators are **identical**!

## Step 3: Evaluate outcomes with a mediator

**If both players delegate:**
- Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → 5 points each ✓

**If only I delegate:**
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- Best case for me: 3 points (regardless of opponent's action)
- I'm protected from getting 0

**If only opponent delegates:**
- Mediator plays A1 for them
- If I play A1: I get 3
- If I play A0: I get 0

## Step 4: Strategic analysis

With this mediator present:
- If opponent delegates, my best response is to **delegate** (get 5 vs 3 max)
- Delegating protects me from the worst outcome (0 points)
- Both delegating creates an equilibrium at the efficient outcome (5, 5)

The mediator solves the coordination problem by creating incentives for both players to delegate, achieving the best outcome.

## Step 5: Decision

Since both mediators are identical and both help achieve the efficient (A0, A0) outcome, I should approve both. Having a mediator is strictly beneficial compared to having none.

response:
To maximize the total points received in this game, we need to carefully consider our strategy based on the available actions, the potential payoffs, and the role of the mediator.

Firstly, let's restate the given payoffs:

- If both choose A0: both get 5 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: both get 3 points.

### Strategy Analysis

#### Independent Actions (A0 and A1)
- **A0**: This action is very risky if the other player chooses A1 (you get 0 points).
- **A1**: This action is safer because even if both players choose A1, each gets 3 points, which is better than getting 0.

#### Delegating to the Mediator (A2)
- **1 player(s) delegating**: Mediator plays A1.
- **2 player(s) delegating**: Mediator plays A0.

### Example Payoffs
1. If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:
   - Both get 5 points.
2. If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
   - You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
3. If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
   - You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
4. If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:
   - Both get 3 points.
5. If one player delegates and the other chooses A0:
   - Delegating player (mediator action A1): Gets 3 points.
   - A0 player: Gets 3 points.
6. If one player delegates and the other chooses A1:
   - Delegating player (mediator action A1): Both get 3 points.
7. If both players delegate:
   - Mediator makes both play A0, both get 5 points.

### Conclusion
Given the relatively high payoff from choosing A1 consistently and the guarantee of higher points for cooperative strategies, I also want to consider a good balance of delegating to the mediator. Here I'm aiming for a safer strategy where I won't lose out by getting 0 points frequently; thus, combining A1 and A2 actions seems beneficial.

### Proposed Strategy
- A0 - Rare since it has potential high risk.
- A1 - Provides stable medium result.
- A2 - Delegating to the mediator could result in favorable outcomes depending on the other player's move.

Here's the final strategy formulated as JSON object with percentage points summing to 100:

```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 45, "A2": 45}
```

Explanation:
- **A0** chosen 10% of the time to keep options open for the highest reward scenario.
- **A1** chosen 45% of the time for its consistency in securing a decent number of points.
- **A2** also chosen 45% of the time due to the potential of 3-5 points by cooperating via the mediator.

response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game
The payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): 5 points for me
- (A0, A1): 0 points for me  
- (A1, A0): 3 points for me
- (A1, A1): 3 points for me

This is a coordination game where mutual cooperation (A0, A0) gives the best outcome (5, 5), but there's a risk - if I play A0 and they play A1, I get nothing.

## Step 2: Analyze the mediator mechanism
- If only 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1 for that player
- If both players delegate: mediator plays A0 for both players

## Step 3: Calculate my payoffs for each action against opponent's choices

| My Action | Opponent plays A0 | Opponent plays A1 | Opponent delegates |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **A0**    | 5                | 0                 | 0 (they get A1)   |
| **A1**    | 3                | 3                 | 3 (they get A1)   |
| **A2 (Delegate)** | 3 (I get A1) | 3 (I get A1)      | **5 (both get A0)** |

## Step 4: Identify dominated strategies
Notice that A2 (Delegate) **weakly dominates** A1:
- Against opponent's A0: both give 3
- Against opponent's A1: both give 3  
- Against opponent's A2: A2 gives 5, A1 gives only 3

Therefore, I should never play A1.

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning
The mediator creates a clever coordination mechanism:
- If both players delegate → we both get 5 (the cooperative outcome)
- If I delegate but opponent doesn't → I get 3 (same as mutual defection)
- If opponent delegates, my best response is to also delegate (5 > 3 > 0)

Since Player 2 proposed this mediator, they likely understand its purpose: to achieve mutual cooperation through delegation. The rational expectation is that Player 2 will delegate.

## Step 6: Best response
Given that Player 2 will likely delegate, my best response is to also delegate to achieve the (5, 5) outcome. Even if they don't delegate, delegation never gives me less than 3, which is acceptable.

**Conclusion:** Pure delegation is the optimal strategy.

response:
Both proposed mediators have the *same policy*:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that delegating player.
- If both players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both delegating players.

So, from my perspective, there is no strategic difference between selecting M1 vs M2: whichever wins, the mediator behavior is identical. Therefore, I’m indifferent and should approve both (this avoids accidentally blocking the mediator option via the approval process, while not sacrificing anything since they’re equivalent).

response:
To maximize our points in this game, let's evaluate the payoff structure and the role of the proposed mediators.

### 1. Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for Player 2 is:
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A0, A1): 3 points
- (A1, A0): 0 points
- (A1, A1): 3 points

Looking at the payoffs:
- If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2's best response is A0 (5 points vs. 3 points).
- If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2's best response is A1 (3 points vs. 0 points).

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) at (5, 5) and (A1, A1) at (3, 3). However, A0 is "risky" because if the other player switches to A1, you receive 0 points (specifically for Player 2, playing A0 while Player 1 plays A1 leads to 0 points). A1 is "safe" because it guarantees Player 2 exactly 3 points regardless of Player 1's action.

### 2. Mediator Analysis
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A1 (the safe move).
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both players (the high-payoff move).

### 3. Impact of Delegating
If you approve and delegate to such a mediator:
- **If both players delegate:** You are guaranteed the Pareto-optimal payoff of 5 points.
- **If only you delegate:** The mediator plays A1 for you. Since A1 guarantees you 3 points regardless of what the other player does, you are protected from the 0-point outcome.
- **If only the other player delegates:** They play A1. You can choose to play A1 as well to get 3 points.

The mediators act as a coordination mechanism that allows both players to safely commit to action A0. If both players use the mediator, they reach the (5, 5) outcome. If the coordination fails (only one player delegates), the delegating player is defaulted to the safe action A1, ensuring they receive 3 points instead of 0.

### 4. Decision
Since both M1 and M2 are identical and provide a mechanism to reach the high-payoff equilibrium (5, 5) while mitigating the risk of the (A1, A0) or (A0, A1) outcomes, they are both highly beneficial for Player 2.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix
From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Analyze what the mediator does
- If only 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1
- If both players delegate: mediator plays A0

## Step 3: Calculate expected payoffs for each action

**If I play A0:**
- vs opponent's A0: 5 points
- vs opponent's A1: 0 points  
- vs opponent delegates (→A1): 0 points
Expected: 5q₀ (where q₀ = prob opponent plays A0)

**If I play A1:**
- vs opponent's A0: 3 points
- vs opponent's A1: 3 points
- vs opponent delegates (→A1): 3 points
Expected: 3 points (always)

**If I delegate (A2):**
- vs opponent's A0: I play A1 → 3 points
- vs opponent's A1: I play A1 → 3 points
- vs opponent delegates: Both delegate → both play A0 → 5 points
Expected: 3(1-q₂) + 5q₂ = 3 + 2q₂

## Step 4: Identify Nash equilibria

**Pure strategy equilibrium (A2, A2):**
If opponent delegates, my payoffs are:
- A0: 0 points
- A1: 3 points  
- A2: 5 points ← Best response

By symmetry, if I delegate, opponent's best response is also to delegate.
Result: Both get 5 points (Pareto optimal!)

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning

The key insights:
1. The mediator was proposed by me and approved by both players - signaling intent to coordinate
2. (A2, A2) achieves mutual cooperation with payoff (5,5)
3. No incentive to deviate: if opponent delegates and I don't, I get at most 3 points instead of 5
4. This mechanism solves the coordination problem in the underlying game

The rational choice is to delegate and achieve the coordinated optimal outcome.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### 1. Understanding the Payoff Structure
From my perspective (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 5 points
- (A0, A1): I get 0 points  
- (A1, A0): I get 3 points
- (A1, A1): I get 3 points

### 2. Basic Game Analysis Without Mediator
Let me find when I'm indifferent between actions:
- If Player 1 plays A0 with probability q:
  - My payoff from A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q
  - My payoff from A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

- I prefer A0 when 5q > 3, meaning q > 0.6
- The standard mixed Nash equilibrium would be both players playing A0 with probability 0.6, yielding expected payoff of 3

### 3. Mediator Analysis
The mediator plays **A0 regardless of how many players delegate** (whether 1 or 2).

This means:
- Delegating is strategically equivalent to playing A0
- The mediator creates a coordination mechanism

### 4. Equilibrium with Mediator
Multiple pure strategy equilibria exist where both players effectively play A0:
- (A0, A0) → (5, 5)
- (Delegate, Delegate) → (5, 5)  
- (A0, Delegate) → (5, 5)
- (Delegate, A0) → (5, 5)

All are Nash equilibria and Pareto optimal!

### 5. Why Delegate?
The mediator **was approved by both players through voting**, suggesting:
- Both players want to coordinate on the better outcome
- The mediator serves as a **focal point** for coordination
- (Delegate, Delegate) is the salient strategy that both players can reasonably expect each other to play
- This achieves payoff of 5 for both, better than the mixed equilibrium's payoff of 3

### 6. Strategic Decision
Given that:
- The mediator was democratically approved
- Delegating is a best response if Player 1 delegates (or plays A0)
- It achieves the cooperative, Pareto optimal outcome
- It's a clear focal point for coordination

The rational strategy is to **delegate with full probability**.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which mediator(s) I should approve of.

### Points Analysis
First, consider what each outcome means in terms of points:

- A0, A0: Both get 5 points.
- A0, A1: I get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- A1, A0: I get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- A1, A1: Both get 3 points.

Based on the payoffs, if we both play A0, we maximize total welfare. Both get the highest (5) point total, which is Pareto-optimal in this scenario. 

### Evaluating each Mediator

**Mediator proposed by Player 1**:
- If 1 player delegates: Plays A1.
- If 2 players delegate: Plays A0.

**Mediator proposed by Player 2 (me)**:
- If 1 player delegates: Plays A0.
- If 2 players delegate: Plays A0.

### Individual and Joint Delegation Decisions

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- **1 player delegates:**
  - It will play A1.
  - This could be detrimental because if I delegate and Player 1 doesn't, I will play A1, and Player 1 will play whatever they choose. If Player 1 chooses to act independently and plays A0, they get 3 points, and I get 0 points. If they play A1, we both end up with 3 points.
- **2 players delegate:**
  - It will play A0.
  - This is beneficial because if both of us delegate, both actions will be A0, resulting in 5 points for each.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2 (me):
- **1 player delegates:**
  - It will play A0.
  - Playing A0 is beneficial since it could result in higher points if the other player also plays A0 or if they delegate to this mediator as well.
- **2 players delegate:**
  - It will play A0.
  - This ensures that both actions will be A0, resulting in 5 points for each.

### Approval Decision Criteria:
1. The points matrix indicates the highest mutual benefit (5,5) occurs when both play A0.
2. The mediator proposed by Player 2 always plays A0, guaranteeing mutual benefit regardless of whether one or both delegate.
3. The mediator proposed by Player 1 has a consistency issue with one player delegating, potentially playing A1, which could lead to suboptimal outcomes.

Given these considerations, it makes sense to approve the mediator that prioritizes the action A0 uniformly, i.e., my proposed mediator.

### Conclusion and JSON Output
Approving only the mediator that guarantees playing A0 maximizes my expected points while promoting mutual benefit. Hence, I will approve only my mediator.

```json
{"M1": false, "M2": true}
```

This final approval ensures that the selected mediator (if approved) will always choose actions that maximize the points both players can receive.

Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step, taking into account the standard game, the presence of a mediator, and the strategic implications of delegation.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediator)**

The base game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | (5, 5)     | (0, 3)     |
| **A1**                        | (3, 0)     | (3, 3)     |

This is a variant of a coordination game with a twist:  
- If both play A0, both get 5 (best outcome).  
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 0 (bad).  
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0, you get 3 (better than 0).  
- If both play A1, both get 3.

So:
- A0 is better when the other player plays A0.
- A1 is safer when the other player plays A1, but gives less if the other plays A0.

This resembles a **battle of the sexes** or **coordination with a preference for A0**.

Now, we must consider **rational play**.

Let’s look for Nash equilibria in the pure strategies:
- (A0, A0): mutual payoff (5,5). Is this stable? If you deviate to A1 when opponent plays A0, you get 3 < 5 → no incentive. So yes, stable.
- (A1, A1): (3,3). If you deviate to A0, you get 0 < 3 → no incentive. So also stable.
- (A0, A1): you get 0. You’d want to switch to A1 to get 3. So unstable.
- (A1, A0): you get 3. Opponent gets 0. Opponent would want to switch to A1 to get 3. So unstable.

So there are **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

Now, there could also be a **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Let’s compute it.

Let:
- You play A0 with probability **p**
- Opponent plays A0 with probability **q**

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 5*q + 0*(1-q) = 5q
- If you play A1: 3*q + 3*(1-q) = 3

For indifference (mixed strategy equilibrium), set them equal:
5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

Similarly, opponent's indifference:
- If opponent plays A0: 5p + 0*(1-p) = 5p
- If opponent plays A1: 3p + 3*(1-p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5

So in the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, both players play A0 with probability 3/5 and A1 with 2/5.

Expected payoff for each in this equilibrium:
- Your payoff = 5 * (3/5) * (3/5) + 0 * (3/5)*(2/5) + 3 * (2/5)*(3/5) + 3 * (2/5)*(2/5)
= 5*(9/25) + 0 + 3*(6/25) + 3*(4/25)
= 45/25 + 18/25 + 12/25 = 75/25 = 3

So everyone gets **3 expected points** in the mixed equilibrium.

But (A0,A0) gives 5 — better.

However, in a symmetric game without coordination, players might not achieve coordination.

But now comes the **twist**: the mediator.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator and Delegation**

You have a third action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

Mediator’s behavior:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0

Important: You are Player 2. Player 1 is the one who proposed the mediator.

You must decide whether to **act independently** (choose A0 or A1) or **delegate (A2)**.

Note: It is a **simultaneous choice**, so you don’t know whether Player 1 will delegate or not.

Let’s consider the **possible scenarios** based on delegation choices.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Possible Outcomes Based on Delegation**

Let’s denote:
- You play A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)
- Player 1 plays A0, A1, or A2

We need to analyze **expected payoffs** under all combinations.

But since we are choosing a **mixed strategy**, we must find a **best response** in the expanded game.

Let’s list the combinations and what happens.

Let’s denote:
- Player 1’s choice
- Your choice
- Number of delegations (1 or 2)
- Mediator’s action (if any)
- Your final action
- Opponent’s final action (which depends on whether they delegated or not)
- Payoffs

Let’s go case by case.

---

#### **Case 1: You delegate (A2), Player 1 delegates (A2)** → 2 delegations → mediator plays **A0**

- Your action: A0
- Opponent’s action: A0
- Result: (A0, A0) → you get **5**

#### **Case 2: You delegate (A2), Player 1 does not delegate (A0 or A1)** → 1 delegation → mediator plays **A1**

So:
- Your action: A1
- Opponent’s action: what Player 1 chose (A0 or A1)
- So:
  - If Player 1 chose A0 → you (A1) vs opponent (A0) → payoff: **3**
  - If Player 1 chose A1 → you (A1) vs opponent (A1) → payoff: **3**

So in both subcases → **3 points**

> Conclusion: If you delegate and Player 1 does **not** delegate → you get **3**, regardless of what Player 1 chooses.

#### **Case 3: You do not delegate (A0 or A1), Player 1 delegates (A2)** → 1 delegation → mediator plays A1

So:
- Your action: whatever you chose (A0 or A1)
- Opponent's action: A1
- So:
  - If you play A0 → you get 0 (A0 vs A1)
  - If you play A1 → you get 3 (A1 vs A1)

> So your payoff depends on what you choose.

#### **Case 4: Neither delegates (both choose A0 or A1)** → no mediator → game as before.

So it depends on both actions.

Now, we must find a **mixed strategy equilibrium** in this expanded game with actions {A0, A1, A2}.

---

### **Step 4: Consider Strategic Incentives**

We are Player 2.

Let’s suppose we try to **always delegate** (A2 with 100%).

Then:
- If Player 1 also delegates → you both get A0 → you get 5
- If Player 1 does not delegate → you get 3 (as above)

So you get:
- 5 if Player 1 delegates
- 3 otherwise

So your expected payoff depends on Player 1’s strategy.

But Player 1 is rational and will try to maximize **their own** payoff.

So we must think about **what Player 1 would do** depending on your strategy.

This is a **game with two rational players**, each trying to optimize their own payoffs.

Let’s look at **incentives for Player 1**.

---

Let’s suppose **you always delegate** (A2 with 100%).

Then:
- Player 1 faces a decision: delegate or not.

Evaluate their options:

1. **Player 1 delegates (A2)**:
   - Then: 2 delegations → mediator plays A0
   - Player 1’s action: A0
   - Your action: A0 (from mediator)
   - So payoff: (A0, A0) → **5**

2. **Player 1 does NOT delegate**:
   - Then: 1 delegation → mediator plays A1
   - Player 1’s action: they choose A0 or A1 (but since they are rational, they’ll choose the best response)
   - Your action: A1 (from mediator)
   - So:
     - If Player 1 plays A0 → (A0, A1) → they get 3
     - If Player 1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → they get 3

So either way → they get 3.

So if they don’t delegate, they get 3.
If they delegate, they get 5.

So **Player 1 will delegate if you delegate**.

So if you always delegate:
- Player 1 will also delegate
- Then both get A0 → you get 5

So your payoff is **5**.

That’s great! So **if you always delegate**, Player 1 **also delegates**, and you both get 5.

But wait — is this **Nash equilibrium**?

Let’s check: Is it a best response for Player 2 to always delegate, given that Player 1 does?

Yes — in this case, if Player 1 delegates, you get 5 by delegating — that’s the best possible.

But what if Player 1 **does not** delegate?

Then your payoff is 3 (as above), which is worse than 5.

So your best response to Player 1 **not** delegating would be to **not** delegate? Let’s see.

Suppose Player 1 does **not** delegate (they play A0 or A1).

Then:
- If you delegate → you get A1 (because only 1 delegate), and opponent plays A0 or A1 → you get 3.
- If you play A0 → payoffs depend:
   - If opponent plays A0 → (A0,A0) → you get 5
   - If opponent plays A1 → (A0,A1) → you get 0
- If you play A1 → (A1,A0) or (A1,A1) → you get 3 or 3 → always 3

So if you don’t delegate, your expected payoff depends on what Player 1 does.

But in the equilibrium where both delegate, Player 1 **will** delegate only if you do.

So if you deviate and **don’t** delegate, and Player 1 still does, then:

- Your action: whatever you choose (say A0)
- Player 1’s action: A0 (since they delegated)
- So you get (A0, A0) → 5 — same as before!

Wait — interesting.

So let’s go back and **assume Player 1 is going to delegate** (as per the best response to you).

Then:
- If you **delegate** → you get 5 (since two delegations → A0)
- If you **don’t delegate** and play A0 → you get 5, same outcome
- If you **don’t delegate** and play A1 → you get 3

So if Player 1 delegates, your best response is to play **A0** (either by delegating or playing independently), and you get 5.

So if Player 1 delegates, you are **indifferent** between delegating and playing A0 (both give 5).

But if you play A1, you get 3 → worse.

So your best responses:
- If Player 1 delegates → you prefer A0 (either directly or via delegation)
- If Player 1 does **not** delegate → then:
   - If you delegate → you get 3 (because 1 delegate → mediator plays A1)
   - If you play A0 → you get 5 only if Player 1 plays A0, 0 otherwise
   - If you play A1 → you get 3

So unless you’re confident Player 1 plays A0, you might prefer to get 3 for sure.

But here’s the key: **if Player 1 is rational, they will delegate only if it’s good for them**.

Let’s suppose **you do not delegate**, and play A0.

Then Player 1 faces:
- If they delegate: 1 delegation → mediator plays A1
   - Their action: A1
   - Your action: A0
   - Result: (A0, A1) → they get 3
- If they don’t delegate:
   - They can play A0 or A1

But if they play A0: (A0,A0) → they get 5
If they play A1: (A1,A0) → they get 0

So rational Player 1 will play A0 → payoff 5 > 3

So if you play A0, Player 1 will **not** delegate and play A0 → you both get 5.

So that’s good for you.

Similarly, if you play A1, then:
- If Player 1 delegates: you both get A1 → you get 3
- If Player 1 does not delegate: they get to play A0 or A1
   - If they play A0: you get 0
   - If they play A1: you get 3
   - So they will play A1 (get 3) instead of A0 (get 0)

So if you play A1, Player 1 will play A1 → you both get 3

So if you play A1, you get 3.

Whereas if you play A0, you can get 5.

So you prefer A0 over A1.

Now back to delegation.

Let’s suppose you consider a **mixed strategy**.

But notice: **there is a symmetric equilibrium where both players play A0 (independently) and get 5**.

Another equilibrium: both **delegate**, get 5.

Are both equilibria valid? Yes.

But **is there a better one**?

Wait — **what if you randomize**?

Let’s suppose **you randomize between A0 and A2**.

But we must consider consistency.

Suppose Player 1 is going to play **A0** (as a pure strategy).

Then:
- If you play A0 → (A0,A0) → you get 5
- If you play A1 → (A1,A0) → you get 3
- If you delegate → now: if you delegate, and Player 1 plays A0 (so no delegation), then only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → result: A1 vs A0 → you get 3

So your payoff:
- A0 → 5
- A1 → 3
- A2 → 3

So you prefer A0.

Now suppose Player 1 is mixing.

But let’s go back to the **two symmetric equilibria**:

1. **Both play A0** → you get 5
2. **Both delegate** → you get 5

In both cases, you get 5 — which is the maximum possible.

Now, is **delegation** better in any way?

Only if it **increases** the chance of getting 5.

But in both equilibria, you get 5.

But perhaps **delegation** is more robust to coordination failure?

Wait — let’s consider a **mixed strategy equilibrium with delegation**.

But here’s a key insight:

If you **always delegate**, and Player 1 is rational, they will also delegate (because they get 5 > 3), leading to (A0,A0) → you get 5.

So **delegating gives you a way to enforce coordination on A0**.

What about the **opposite**: if you don’t delegate, and Player 1 might not coordinate?

But Player 1, being rational, would prefer (A0,A0) over (A1,A1) — 5 > 3.

So both players have **incentive to coordinate on A0**.

So in the **standard game**, (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

So the **best outcome** is achievable without delegation.

But delegation offers a **commitment device**.

If you **commit to delegating**, and Player 1 sees you do that, they will **also want to delegate** to get 5 — since if they don’t, they only get 3.

Similarly, **if you commit to playing A0**, Player 1 will play A0.

So both are equally effective at achieving the **mutual A0** outcome.

But is there a **reason to prefer delegation**?

Let’s consider a scenario where **there is uncertainty**.

But in this case, we are to choose a **mixed strategy** — so we are to compute a best response to the **other player’s strategy**, but we don’t know it.

Wait — we must assume we are in a **symmetric game**, and compute a **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**?

But no — we are **Player 2**, and we are to maximize **our own** payoff.

And we don't know Player 1's strategy.

But Player 1 is rational too.

So we must think about **what Player 1 would do** given our strategy.

So let’s suppose we are choosing a **mixed strategy**: p0 for A0, p1 for A1, p2 for A2, with p0 + p1 + p2 = 100.

But we need to find a strategy that is a **best reply** to Player 1’s best reply, and so on.

Let’s suppose we **always delegate** (p2 = 100).

Then, as shown earlier, Player 1’s best response is to also delegate → because they get 5 > 3.

So the outcome is both play A0 → you get 5.

So you get 5.

Now, suppose instead we **never delegate** — p2 = 0.

Then Player 1 may choose to play A0 (if they think you will).

But you are playing, say, a mix.

But suppose we play A0 with 100% — not delegating.

Then Player 1 would also play A0 → you get 5.

Same outcome.

But now, suppose Player 1 **might not** play A0.

But in equilibrium, they will.

So both pure strategies (always delegate, or always play A0) lead to 5.

But is there a **risk**?

Suppose **you are uncertain whether Player 1 will coordinate**.

Then delegating ensures a **safe outcome**?

Wait — no. Let’s see.

Suppose **you are unsure of Player 1’s behavior**.

But in the game, both players are rational and know the rules.

So they can reason through the equilibrium.

But here’s a **crucial point**: **if you delegate, you force the outcome to depend on the number of delegations**.

But if **only you delegate**, you get A1 → you get 3.

If **both delegate**, you get A0 → you get 5.

So by delegating, you are **betting** that Player 1 will also delegate.

If they don’t, you get 3.

But if you play A0 yourself, and they play A0, you get 5.

So **you are indifferent** between delegating and playing A0 **only if you are sure** that Player 1 will play A0.

So **delegation is only beneficial if it increases the probability of coordination**.

But in this case, it doesn’t — both strategies allow coordination.

But here’s an **important difference**:

Suppose you play A0, and Player 1 also plays A0 → you get 5.

But suppose Player 1 plays A1 — you get 0.

But if you delegate, and Player 1 doesn't delegate, you get 3 — which is better than 0.

Wait — this is a key insight!

Let’s compare:

- **If you play A0**:
   - If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 5
   - If Player 1 plays A1 → you get 0

- **If you delegate**:
   - If Player 1 plays A0 → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get (A1, A0) = 3
   - If Player 1 plays A1 → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → (A1, A1) = 3

So **by delegating, you guarantee yourself 3** — **no matter what Player 1 does**.

Whereas **by playing A0**, you get 5 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1.

So **delegation is a safer strategy** if you are uncertain.

But in equilibrium, both players will coordinate on A0, so you **expect** to get 5.

But suppose there is **a chance** that Player 1 plays A1 (e.g., due to noise or miscoordination).

Then delegating eliminates the risk of getting 0 — and guarantees 3.

But 3 is **less** than 5, but **much better** than 0.

So **delegation hedges against worst-case**.

But we are maximizing **expected payoff**.

So we need to compare expected payoffs.

But we don’t know Player 1’s strategy.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** where players’ strategies are consistent.

Let’s consider a **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**.

But given the complexity, let’s consider a **simple equilibrium** where **both players delegate**.

As we’ve seen:
- If you delegate, Player 1 will delegate → because they get 5 > 3.
- So if both delegate, outcome is A0,A0 → both get 5.

Is this stable?

Suppose you **deviate** to not delegating.

Then:
- You are not delegating → so only 1 delegate (Player 1) → mediator plays A1 → your action: A1
- Player 1 plays A0 (from mediator) → so (A1, A0) → you get 3

But previously you got 5.

So you get 3 < 5 — so **no incentive to deviate**.

Similarly, if Player 1 deviates, same thing.

So (A2, A2) — both delegate — is a **Nash equilibrium**, giving 5 each.

Now, is (A0, A0) also an equilibrium?

Yes: both play A0, get 5.

If you deviate to A1: get 3 < 5 — no.

If you deviate to delegation: 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get (A1, A0) = 3 < 5 — so no incentive.

So **(A0, A0)** is also a Nash equilibrium.

Now, is there a **mixed strategy equilibrium**?

For example, suppose both players mix.

But notice: **both A0 and A2 give the same outcome** (A0,A0) under mutual choice.

But only if the other player coordinates.

Now, here’s the **key**: if you **delegate**, and the other player **delegates**, you get 5.

If you **play A0**, and the other player plays A0, you get 5.

But if one delegates and the other doesn’t, you get 3.

But if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0.

So **delegation gives you a guaranteed 3**, while playing A0 might give you 0.

So **in a situation where coordination is not certain**, delegation is **superior**.

But in equilibrium, **both players will coordinate** — so both are fine.

But which one is **better**?

The **payoff is the same** in both equilibria: 5.

But is there a **way to get more than 5**? No.

So **both are equally good**.

But now consider: what if we make a **mistake**?

But in game theory, we assume rationality.

However, **delegation provides a commitment** that may be useful in multi-round games, but here it’s one-shot.

But notice: **if we play A0 with high probability**, but not 100%, and Player 1 plays A0 with high probability, expected payoff could be high.

But we must find a **best response**.

Let’s suppose Player 1 is using a strategy.

But we don’t know it.

So what is the **best symmetric strategy**?

Let’s try a **symmetric mixed strategy**:

Let each player play:
- A0 with probability p
- A1 with probability q
- A2 with probability r
- p + q + r = 1

But we need to find equilibrium.

But that’s complex.

Instead, let’s **compare pure strategies**.

**Option 1: Always delegate (A2: 100%)**
- If Player 1 also delegates → both get 5
- If Player 1 does not delegate → you get 3
- But Player 1, being rational, will **only not delegate if they expect you to not delegate**
- But if you commit to delegate, Player 1 will **also delegate**
- So equilibrium payoff: 5

**Option 2: Always play A0 (A0: 100%)**
- If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 5
- If Player 1 plays A1 → you get 0
- But Player 1, rational, will play A0 to get 5 > 3 (if they play A1 and you play A0, they get 3)
- So Player 1 plays A0 → you get 5

So again, 5.

Now, is there a **risk** in playing A0? Yes — if Player 1 believes you will not play A0, they might play A1.

But if they are rational, they will play A0 only if they expect you to play A0.

But in equilibrium, they do.

So **both strategies lead to 5**.

But now, if there is any doubt in the mind of Player 1, then playing A0 without commitment might fail.

But **delegation commits you to a behavior that leads to A0 if both delegate**, and is **safe** if only one delegates.

But since both have incentive to delegate, it leads to 5.

Moreover, **delegation can be seen as a way to coordinate more reliably**.

But in this case, both strategies are symmetric in outcome.

However, **there is a subtle advantage to delegation**.

Let’s suppose **you are not sure whether Player 1 will play A0**.

For example, if Player 1 is risk-averse, or has a different equilibrium expectation.

But in the game, Player 1 can reason as we did.

But notice: **if you delegate, your payoff is at least 3**, whereas if you play A0, your payoff could be 0.

So **delegation is not worse in any case**.

Therefore, **delegation is a dominant strategy in some way**?

Let’s test:

Compare:
- Playing A0 vs delegating (A2), **conditional on Player 1's action**.

Case 1: Player 1 plays A0:
- Play A0: you get 5
- Delegate: you get 3 (since only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → A1 vs A0 → 3)
→ So A0 is better

Case 2: Player 1 plays A1:
- Play A0: you get 0
- Delegate: you get 3
→ Delegate is better

So whether Player 1 plays A0 or A1, **delegation is never worse than A0**, and sometimes better.

- Against A0: A0 gives 5, delegation gives 3 → A0 better
- Against A1: A0 gives 0, delegation gives 3 → delegation better

So it depends.

But if you are uncertain about Player 1's action, delegation **reduces risk**.

But if you are certain they play A0, then playing A0 is better.

But in equilibrium, they play A0.

So **in the equilibrium where both play A0**, you should play A0.

But the **only way to ensure** that the **other player also plays A0** is to make sure they have **incentive**.

And delegation gives them an incentive: by delegating, they get 5.

But so does playing A0.

So both work.

But **delegation is a commitment device** that makes the outcome **deterministic** in one equilibrium.

However, since both lead to the same payoff, and the problem asks to **maximize your total points**, and you can achieve 5 in multiple ways, we should pick the one that **always gives you at least 3**, and **gives 5 in equilibrium**.

But there is **one more idea**.

Suppose Player 1 is **not** going to delegate.

Then if you delegate, you get 3.

If you play A0, you might get 5 or 0.

But if Player 1 is not going to delegate, they are playing A0 or A1.

But if they play A0, you get 5 by playing A0.

If they play A1, you get 0.

But if they play A0, and you play A0, both get 5.

But if they are not delegating, they might be playing A0.

But why would they not delegate?

Only if they believe you won't.

But if you are going to delegate, they will too.

So eventually, both delegate.

So in equilibrium, it's fine.

So the **safest and best choice is to delegate**.

Why? Because:
- It guarantees you at least 3
- It leads to the optimal 5 if both delegate
- And it **induces** the other player to delegate

Moreover, **no other action is better than delegation in any case**?

No — against A0, A0 is better.

But in the equilibrium, you expect the other player to play A0 only if you play A0.

But if you delegate, you get the same 5.

And if the other player is not following the equilibrium, you are safer.

But in game theory, we want **Nash equilibrium** strategies.

And both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) are equilibria.

But is there a **better one**?

No.

So which to choose?

Let’s suppose we **mix**.

For example, play A0 with 90%, A2 with 10%.

But then expected payoff depends on Player 1.

But there is a **very simple strategy**: **always delegate**.

And we can be confident it works.

Moreover, in the literature of coordination games with mediators, delegation to a mediator that provides a coordinated outcome is a way to achieve Pareto superiority.

Here, the mediator **enforces coordination on A0** when both delegate.

So **delegation is the best way to achieve the good outcome**.

And since both players have incentive to delegate, it’s stable.

So **we should choose to delegate with 100% probability**.

But is there a reason not to?

Suppose you delegate, and Player 1 is not rational or doesn't understand.

But the problem assumes rational players.

So yes.

Therefore, the best strategy is to **always delegate**.

Final decision: play **A2 (Delegate)** with 100%.

Then:
- If Player 1 delegates, you get 5
- If Player 1 doesn’t, you get 3
- But rational Player 1 will delegate, so you get 5.

And you get the same in the other equilibrium.

But delegation is safer in case of error.

But in perfect rationality, both work.

But since delegation **dominates** in the sense that it **never gives less than 3**, and A0 might give 0, but in equilibrium it gives 5, but **it's less risky**.

Moreover, in some game-theoretic settings, **delegation to a third party** can be used to achieve coordination.

Given all this, and that the mediator's rule aligns with coordination on A0 when both use it, the **optimal strategy is to delegate**.

So:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game

We are Player 2 in a 2-player game with actions:
- A0
- A1
- A2 (Delegate to Mediator)

The standard payoffs are:

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Your Points | Opponent's Points |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| A0          | A0               | 5            | 5                  |
| A0          | A1               | 0            | 3                  |
| A1          | A0               | 3            | 0                  |
| A1          | A1               | 3            | 3                  |

So the base game is a coordination game with a twist: cooperating on A0 gives both 5, but choosing A0 while opponent chooses A1 gives you 0, and vice versa for A1.

But now, there is a **mediator** who can take over your decision if you delegate (via A2). The mediator's behavior depends on **how many players delegate to it**:

- If only **one player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **two players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Note: Since there are only two players, the number of delegators can be 0, 1, or 2.

---

### Step 2: Consider Strategy Space

You (Player 2) choose a probability distribution over:
- A0
- A1
- A2 (Delegate)

The other player (Player 1) also chooses a strategy over A0, A1, A2.

But the mediator’s choice depends on **how many players delegate**, not who they are.

So we must consider the **joint strategy profile** (your strategy and opponent’s strategy).

Our goal: **Maximize your expected points**, assuming both players are rational and self-interested.

We are trying to find the **optimal mixed strategy** for you (Player 2), taking into account that the other player may also delegate.

But here's the twist: **You get to choose your strategy, and you're told the mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting — meaning the mediator is fixed and used by both players (if they choose to delegate).**

So, we can model this as a simultaneous-move game where each player picks:
- A0
- A1
- A2

With the mediator acting based on the total number of delegates.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Possible Outcomes Based on Delegation

Let’s define possible combinations of delegates from both players.

Let’s denote:
- Your action: A0, A1, or A2
- Opponent's action: A0, A1, or A2

We care about the **number of delegates** (i.e. number of players choosing A2), which determines the mediator’s action.

#### Case 1: 0 players delegate (both choose A0 or A1)
- Mediator does **nothing**
- You play your own action
- Opponent plays their own action
- Payoffs are determined directly

#### Case 2: 1 player delegates
- Mediator plays **A1**
- The player who delegated gets **A1**
- The other player chooses A0 or A1
- So mediator’s move is A1, and sole delegate gets A1
- The other player plays their selected action

#### Case 3: 2 players delegate
- Mediator plays **A0**
- Both players get A0 (because mediator chooses A0 for both)

So in summary:

| Delegates | Mediator Plays | Your Action | Opponent’s Action |
|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0        | —              | Your choice | Their choice      |
| 1        | A1             | A1 (if you delegated) | Their choice |
| 2        | A0             | A0 (if delegated) | A0 (if delegated) |

So **if you delegate**, your action becomes:
- A1 if only you delegate (i.e., opponent doesn't delegate)
- A0 if both delegate

Similarly for opponent.

---

### Step 4: Evaluate the Payoffs in Each Scenario

Let’s analyze each scenario based on your action and opponent’s action, and consequences.

We will compute your **expected payoff** under a mixed strategy, assuming the opponent also plays a strategy (possibly mixed), and use **equilibrium thinking**.

But since the question is asking **for your optimal strategy**, we must find a **Nash equilibrium** mixed strategy for Player 2, assuming the other player also plays optimally.

But note: **You are to choose your own strategy to maximize your expected points.**

So let’s consider **what you should do**, assuming the other player could be rational and might also delegate.

Let’s try to find **symmetric equilibria**, or consider dominant strategies.

---

### Step 5: Consider the Mediator's Effect

Key insight: The mediator’s behavior is **not** aligned with either player’s preferences — it’s a fixed rule.

- If 1 person delegates → mediator plays A1 → the delegate gets A1
- If 2 delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get A0

So:
- If you delegate alone → you get A1
- If both delegate → you get A0
- If no one delegates → you can choose A0 or A1

So if you delegate, your outcome depends on whether the opponent delegates.

Let’s suppose the opponent delegates with probability q.

Then, when you delegate (A2):
- With probability (1−q): opponent does **not** delegate → you get A1 → your payoff depends on opponent’s action:
    - If opponent plays A0: you get 3 (since you are A1, they are A0)
    - If opponent plays A1: you get 3 (both A1 → 3 points)
- With probability q: opponent delegates → both delegate → mediate plays A0 → you get A0 → so you get 5 if opponent also plays A0, 0 if opponent plays A1.

But wait: when both delegate, **you both are assigned A0 regardless of your own choice**.

Similarly, if you delegate and opponent doesn't, **you are assigned A1**.

So your **actual action** depends on delegation, not your choice of A0/A1/A2.

Thus:
- Choosing A0 → you play A0 only if **no one else delegates besides you?** No — wait.

Let’s be careful.

Only **delegates** are subject to the mediator’s decision.

- If you choose A0 → you play A0 **regardless of others**
- If you choose A1 → you play A1 **regardless**
- If you choose A2 → you delegate → your action is determined by the number of delegators.

So **switching to A2 does not mean you play what the mediator says immediately** — it only triggers the mediator **if you delegate**, and whether you are delegated **depends on total number of delegates**.

So:

- If you choose A2 and opponent chooses A0 or A1 → only you delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- If you choose A2 and opponent also chooses A2 → both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
- If you choose A0 or A1 → you act as yourself, regardless of what others do

This is critical.

So your **action** is:
- A0 → if you choose A0
- A1 → if you choose A1
- A1 → if you choose A2 and opponent does **not** choose A2
- A0 → if you choose A2 and opponent **does** choose A2

So your **effective action** is:
- A0: if you choose A0, or if you choose A2 and opponent also chooses A2
- A1: if you choose A1, or if you choose A2 and opponent chooses A0 or A1

So choosing A2 is **not deterministic** — it depends on others.

---

### Step 6: What’s the best choice?

Let’s look at possible payoffs for different combinations, under different signalings.

Suppose the opponent is rational and will also try to maximize their payoff.

We need to find a **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s hypothesize a **symmetric equilibrium**, where both players use the same strategy.

Suppose both players use a strategy that randomizes over A0, A1, A2.

But we are only asked to compute **your strategy**.

Alternatively, maybe there’s a **dominant strategy**, or a **best response**.

Let’s try to analyze from your perspective.

Assume the opponent is playing some fixed strategy.

We can try to see if **A2 (delegate)** is ever beneficial.

---

### Step 7: Evaluate Payoff of A2

Let’s suppose you consider **delegating (A2)**. Your payoff depends on the opponent’s choice.

Let’s suppose the opponent chooses A0 with probability p0, A1 with p1, A2 with p2, summing to 1.

Then, if you choose A2:

- With probability (1 − p2): opponent **does not delegate**
    - So only you delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
    - You play A1
    - Opponent plays whatever they chose: A0 with p0, A1 with p1
    - Your payoff:
        - If opponent plays A0: you play A1 vs A0 → you get 3
        - If opponent plays A1: you play A1 vs A1 → you get 3
    - So **you always get 3** if only you delegate

- With probability p2: opponent also delegates
    - Both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0
    - You play A0
    - Opponent plays whatever they chose: A0 with p0, A1 with p1
    - Your payoff:
        - If opponent plays A0: you both A0 → you get 5
        - If opponent plays A1: you play A0 vs A1 → you get 0

So your **expected payoff from A2** is:

E[A2] = (1 − p2) * 3 + p2 * [p0 * 5 + p1 * 0]  
= 3(1 − p2) + p2 * (5p0)

Note: p0 + p1 + p2 = 1 → p0 = 1 − p1 − p2

So:
E[A2] = 3 − 3p2 + p2 * 5(1 − p1 − p2)  
= 3 − 3p2 + 5p2 − 5p1p2 − 5p2²  
= 3 + 2p2 − 5p1p2 − 5p2²

---

Now consider playing A0.

If you play A0:
- You play A0 regardless of what opponent does

Your payoff:
- If opponent plays A0: you get 5
- If opponent plays A1: you get 0
- If opponent plays A2: you play A0 vs opponent’s action

Wait: if opponent plays A2, then:
- Opponent has delegated (A2)
- So number of delegates = 1 (only opponent) → mediator plays A1
- Opponent plays A1
- You play A0
- So you play A0 vs A1 → you get 0

So:
- If opponent plays A0 → you get 5
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- If opponent plays A2 → you get 0 (because opponent becomes A1)

So your expected payoff from A0:

E[A0] = p0 * 5 + p1 * 0 + p2 * 0 = 5p0

Similarly, if you play A1:
- You play A1
- Opponent plays:
    - If A0: you A1 vs A0 → you get 3
    - If A1: you A1 vs A1 → you get 3
    - If A2: opponent delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1
    - So you play A1 vs A1 → you get 3

So **if you choose A1**, regardless of opponent’s choice, you get 3.

- A0 → you get 3
- A1 → you get 3
- A2 → opponent plays A1 → you get 3

So E[A1] = 3

Now this is key.

**Choosing A1 (independent) guarantees you 3 points, no matter what the opponent does.**

Because:
- If opponent plays A0 → you play A1 vs A0 → 3 points
- If opponent plays A1 → both A1 → 3 points
- If opponent plays A2 → opponent becomes A1 (mediator plays A1) → you play A1 vs A1 → 3 points

So A1 is **dominant strategy**?

Wait — yes! Because **no matter what opponent does, you get 3 points if you choose A1**.

Now, what about A0?
- E[A0] = 5p0
- p0 can be 0 → E[A0] = 0
- p0 can be 1 → E[A0] = 5
- But if p0 is low (e.g., if opponent often delegates or plays A1), A0 may be bad.

A2 gives:
E[A2] = 3 + 2p2 − 5p1p2 − 5p2²

Since p2 ≥ 0, this is maximized when p2 is small, but also depends on p0.

But let’s compare:

- A1: always gives 3 → **guaranteed 3**
- A0: gives 5p0 — could be less or more
- A2: depends, but generally:

Let’s suppose opponent plays a strategy where p2 is small.

Then E[A2] ≈ 3 + 2p2 → slightly above 3

But if p2 is large, E[A2] = 3 + 2p2 − 5p1p2 − 5p2²

Since p1 ≥ 0, the negative terms hurt.

For example, if p2 = 0.5, p1 = 0.5 → then:
E[A2] = 3 + 2(0.5) − 5(0.5)(0.5) − 5(0.25) = 3 + 1 − 1.25 − 1.25 = 1.5

Worse than 3.

But if opponent never delegates (p2 = 0):
E[A2] = 3
Same as A1.

But if p2 > 0 and p0 is small, E[A2] < 3?

Let’s suppose p2 = 0.1, p0 = 0.8, p1 = 0.1 → possible

Then:
E[A2] = 3 + 2(0.1) − 5(0.1)(0.1) − 5(0.01) = 3 + 0.2 − 0.05 − 0.05 = 3.1

Slightly better than 3.

But E[A1] = 3

So A2 slightly better.

But if p0 is small (e.g., p0 = 0.2), p1 = 0.3, p2 = 0.5

Then E[A2] = 3 + 2(0.5) − 5(0.3)(0.5) − 5(0.25) = 3 + 1 − 0.75 − 1.25 = 2 → worse than 3

So A2 is risky.

And A0: E[A0] = 5p0 = 5(0.2) = 1.0 → worse

So if opponent plays p2 = 0.5, A1 still best.

Now, is there a **Nash equilibrium** where players delegate?

Suppose both players play A2 with high probability.

Then, with high probability, both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get A0 → payoff 5

But if one deviates to A1, they get:
- Opponent still plays A2 → opponent becomes A1 (since only one delegate) → you play A1 vs A1 → you get 3
- But if both play A2, you get 5 → so deviation gives only 3 → worse

Similarly, if both play A2, and you deviate to A0:
- Opponent plays A2 → opponent becomes A1 → you play A0 vs A1 → you get 0 → worse

So if both play A2, you get 5.

But if both play A2 with probability 1, then expected payoff is:
- Both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you get 5
- So each gets 5

But is this stable?

Suppose you consider deviating to A1:
- Opponent still plays A2 → opponent becomes A1 → you play A1 vs A1 → you get 3
- But 3 < 5 → so you don’t want to deviate

Similarly, deviating to A0 → you get 0 → worse

So **playing A2 is a best response if the opponent plays A2**

So **(A2, A2)** is a Nash equilibrium? Yes.

At (A2, A2):
- Both delegates → mediator plays A0 → both get A0 → payoffs: (5,5)

And no one benefits from deviating.

But wait — is this better for you than other options?

But in equilibrium, if both players are playing A2, you get 5.

But is there a better equilibrium?

Now suppose both players play A1:
- You play A1, opponent plays A1 → both get 3

Can someone deviate?

If you play A0: opponent plays A1 → you play A0 vs A1 → you get 0 → worse

If you play A2: opponent plays A1 → so only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → opponent plays A1 → you get 3 → same as before

So no benefit → A1 is a best response.

So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium, but only gives 3.

Now (A0, A0): both get 5

But if you deviate to A1: opponent plays A0 → you play A1 vs A0 → you get 3 → 3 < 5 → no benefit

To A2: opponent plays A0 → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 vs A0 → you get 3 → still worse

So (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

So multiple pure strategy equilibria: (A0,A0), (A1,A1), (A2,A2)

But now, what’s the **worst** one? (A1,A1) gives only 3.

(A0,A0) and (A2,A2) both give 5.

But in (A2,A2), players must **delegating**.

But can (A2,A2) be played in a game where players can choose, and they are rational?

Yes — and if both expect that, they may coordinate on it.

But there is a **coordination problem**: how do you coordinate on (A2,A2) vs (A0,A0)?

But here's the twist: **you are Player 2**, and the mediator was **proposed by Player 2** and selected via approval voting — so this suggests that **Player 2 may have a special interest** in using the mediator.

But the rules say: the mediator is available for both players.

But the key point: **you want to maximize your own points**.

Now, both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) give you 5 points.

But in (A0,A0), you play A0.

In (A2,A2), you play A2.

So if you are indifferent between A0 and A2 in terms of outcome, but A2 has additional utility?

But no — the payoff is the same.

But is there a way to **do better**?

Earlier, we saw that **A1 is always safe** — gives you 3 points no matter what.

But 3 < 5, so if you can get 5, better.

Now, here’s the catch: if the other player plays A1, then your A0 gives you 0.

So if the other player might play A1 or A2, A0 is risky.

Similarly, A2 is only safe if opponent also delegates.

But suppose you are in a symmetric equilibrium.

But we want to **maximize your expected payoff**, not necessarily exist in equilibrium.

But in game theory, rational players will play Nash equilibria.

Now, which equilibrium gives you the highest payoff? (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) both give 5.

But (A0,A0) is a natural equilibrium where both play A0.

But (A2,A2) is also stable.

But can you **force** the game into (A2,A2)?

Only if you believe the other player will also play A2.

But if you are not sure, you may prefer a safer strategy.

But recall: **A1 gives you 3 regardless**.

But you can do better.

Now, consider a **mixed strategy**.

Suppose you play **A2 with probability 1**.

Then:
- If opponent plays A2 — you get 5
- If opponent plays A0 — only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 vs A0 → you get 3
- If opponent plays A1 — only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 vs A1 → you get 3

So:
- E = p0 * 3 + p1 * 3 + p2 * 5 = 3(p0 + p1) + 5p2 = 3(1 − p2) + 5p2 = 3 + 2p2

So if you play A2 for sure, your expected payoff is 3 + 2p2

- If the opponent plays A2 with high probability, you get good payoff
- But if opponent plays A0 or A1, you get 3

Now, compare to playing A1: you always get 3

So you are better off playing A2 than A1 if p2 > 0

Similarly, if you play A0 for sure:
E = 5p0 + 0*p1 + 0*p2 = 5p0

Now, to maximize your expected payoff, you need to assume the opponent is playing something.

But since both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff, and (A2,A2) is a stable equilibrium (each gets 5, no incentive to deviate), **both players might coordinate on it**.

Moreover, since the mediator was proposed and approved by Player 2, and is now available, and (A2,A2) gives both 5, same as (A0,A0), it’s reasonable that players might delegate.

But is there a way to **get more than 5**? No — maximum is 5.

Now, what if you play a mix?

But suppose you play A2 with 100% probability.

If opponent is rational and knows that, and if opponent plays A2, you both get 5.

If opponent plays A0 or A1, you get 3.

But if opponent is also rational, and knows you are playing A2 for sure, then their best response?

If you play A2:
- If opponent plays A0: they get what? You play A1 (since only you delegate), opponent plays A0 → they get 3
- If opponent plays A1: you play A1, they play A1 → they get 3
- If opponent plays A2: you both play A0 (mediator) → they get 5

So opponent’s best response is to play A2 → get 5.

So if you play A2, opponent’s best response is to play A2.

Thus, **playing A2 is a best response to opponent playing A2**, and **opponent playing A2 is best response to you playing A2**.

So (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, (A0, A0) is.

But which one is **Pareto-optimal**? Both give 5.

But in (A2,A2), you **delegated**.

But is it possible to get a **higher** expected payoff?

Let’s suppose you play a mixed strategy.

Suppose you play A2 with probability 0.5.

Then your expected payoff depends on opponent’s strategy.

But since (A2,A2) is a stable equilibrium, and gives you 5, and no way to get more, and A1 only gives 3, you should prefer strategies that help coordinate on (A2,A2).

But what if you play A0 with some probability?

If you play A0, and opponent plays A2, you get 0 (since opponent becomes A1, you play A0 vs A1 → 0)

Worse than 3 or 5.

So playing A0 is risky.

Similarly, irrational.

So best strategies are A1 (safe, but only 3) or A2 (good if opponent delegates).

But since (A2,A2) is an equilibrium, and gives you 5, and you want to **maximize**, you should play A2.

But can you play A2 with 100%?

Yes.

Then if the other player is rational, they will play A2 (best response), so you get 5.

Is there any downside?

If the other player is not rational, but you are assumed to be rational, you might want to play something better.

But in game theory, we assume mutual rationality.

So optimal strategy is to play **A2 with 100%**.

But let’s double-check.

Suppose you play A2 (100%).

Then opponent:
- If they play A0: they get 3
- If they play A1: they get 3
- If they play A2: they get 5

So their best response is A2.

Thus, at (A2,A2), both get 5.

No incentive to deviate.

So it's an equilibrium.

Now, if you play A0 or A1, you get at most 5 or 3, but not more.

And A1 only gives 3.

So **A2 gives you 5 in equilibrium, which is the maximum possible**.

Therefore, you should play A2 with 100%.

But what about the possibility of randomizing?

Suppose you mix A2 and A1.

But A1 gives only 3, while A2 gives 5 in equilibrium.

So no reason to mix.

Similarly, A0 is worse.

Therefore, **your optimal strategy** is to **always delegate**.

Thus:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let me work through this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

From my perspective (Player 1):
- Both play A0: I get 5
- I play A0, opponent plays A1: I get 0
- I play A1, opponent plays A0: I get 3
- Both play A1: I get 3

## Step 2: Analyze the base game

My best responses:
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A1 (3 > 0)

The game has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → both get 5 points
- (A1, A1) → both get 3 points

## Step 3: Understand what the mediator does

The mediator always plays A0 (whether 1 or 2 players delegate).

## Step 4: Calculate expected payoffs with delegation option

If opponent plays A0 or delegates with total probability (q0 + q2):
- **If I play A0**: Expected payoff = 5(q0 + q2) + 0·q1
- **If I delegate (A2)**: Mediator plays A0 for me → Expected payoff = 5(q0 + q2) + 0·q1
- **If I play A1**: Expected payoff = 3 (regardless of opponent's action)

Key insight: A0 and A2 give identical expected payoffs!

## Step 5: Determine best response

I should play A0 or A2 when: 5(q0 + q2) > 3, which means q0 + q2 > 0.6

I should play A1 when: q0 + q2 < 0.6

## Step 6: Strategic reasoning

The opponent **proposed this mediator** specifically. This is a strong signal that they intend to use it. The mediator was designed to facilitate coordination on the superior equilibrium (5,5) rather than (3,3).

If opponent delegates (q2 ≈ 1):
- Then q0 + q2 ≈ 1 > 0.6
- I should respond with A0 or A2
- Both give me 5 points

Between A0 and A2 when opponent likely delegates:
- Both yield the same payoff
- A2 (delegation) is the natural focal point and shows commitment to cooperation
- It matches the cooperative intent signaled by the mediator proposal

## Step 7: Verify equilibrium

If both players delegate:
- Both get 5 (the best outcome)
- Neither has incentive to deviate (playing A1 would give only 3)

This is the Pareto-optimal outcome that the mediator was designed to achieve.

## Conclusion

The optimal strategy is to fully delegate to the mediator.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure

As Player 2, my payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points
- (A1, A0): 3 points  
- (A1, A1): 3 points

## Step 2: Analyze the Mediator Option

The mediator plays A0 when:
- 1 player delegates → A0
- 2 players delegate → A0

**Key insight:** If I delegate (A2), the mediator will always play A0 for me, regardless of whether Player 1 delegates or not. So A2 is functionally equivalent to A0.

## Step 3: Determine the Nash Equilibrium

This is a symmetric game. Let me find when each player is indifferent:

If Player 1 plays A0 with probability q:
- My payoff from A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q
- My payoff from A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

I'm indifferent when 5q = 3, so q = 0.6

By symmetry, the mixed Nash equilibrium is:
- Each player plays A0 with probability 0.6
- Each player plays A1 with probability 0.4
- Expected payoff: 3 points

## Step 4: Consider the Coordination Opportunity

The mediator creates a focal point for coordination:
- If both players delegate → (A0, A0) → both get 5 points
- This is better than the Nash expected value of 3

Since I proposed this mediator, it signals my willingness to coordinate. However, there's risk if Player 1 doesn't cooperate.

## Step 5: Choose Strategy

I'll follow the Nash equilibrium probabilities (60% on A0-equivalent actions, 40% on A1) but allocate the A0 probability entirely to delegation to signal coordination intent:

- **A2 (Delegate): 60%** - Signals coordination and is optimal if Player 1 cooperates
- **A1: 40%** - Hedges against Player 1 playing A1
- **A0: 0%** - No need for this since A2 serves the same function

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game
The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5 points each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 points each.

## Step 2: Analyze the Mediator
The mediator plays A0 whether 1 or 2 players delegate. This means:
- If I delegate (A2), the mediator plays A0 for me
- The mediator was proposed by Player 2, signaling their intention

## Step 3: Compare Delegation vs Direct Play
If I delegate (A2):
- Mediator plays A0 for me
- Expected payoff: 5 × P(other plays A0) + 0 × P(other plays A1)

If I play A0 directly:
- Expected payoff: 5 × P(other plays A0) + 0 × P(other plays A1)

If I play A1:
- Expected payoff: 3 (regardless of opponent's action)

**Key insight**: Delegating (A2) and playing A0 directly yield identical payoffs. Both are superior to A1 when the other player chooses A0 with probability > 60%.

## Step 4: Strategic Reasoning
Player 2 proposed this mediator mechanism, which:
- Always plays the cooperative action A0
- Was approved by both players
- Facilitates coordination on the best mutual outcome (5, 5)

This is a strong signal that Player 2 intends to cooperate (either by delegating or playing A0).

## Step 5: Optimal Response
Given Player 2's signal of cooperation:
- If they delegate or play A0 → I should delegate/play A0 (get 5 vs 3)
- The mediator mechanism helps us escape the risk of mis-coordination

Since delegation shows commitment to the cooperative outcome and is functionally equivalent to A0, I'll fully delegate.

response:
To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix, including the option to delegate to the mediator (Action A2).

### 1. Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for Player 1 (rows) and Player 2 (columns) is as follows:

- **(A0, A0)**: Both play A0. Payoff: **(5, 5)**.
- **(A0, A1)**: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1. Payoff: **(0, 3)**.
- **(A0, A2)**: P2 delegates, mediator plays A1. Payoff: **(0, 3)**.
- **(A1, A0)**: P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0. Payoff: **(3, 0)**.
- **(A1, A1)**: Both play A1. Payoff: **(3, 3)**.
- **(A1, A2)**: P2 delegates, mediator plays A1. Payoff: **(3, 3)**.
- **(A2, A0)**: P1 delegates, mediator plays A1. Payoff: **(3, 0)**.
- **(A2, A1)**: P1 delegates, mediator plays A1. Payoff: **(3, 3)**.
- **(A2, A2)**: Both delegate, mediator plays A0 for both. Payoff: **(5, 5)**.

### 2. Strategy Evaluation
- **A1 vs. A2**: For Player 2 (me), action **A2 weakly dominates A1**. If Player 1 plays A0 or A1, A1 and A2 result in the same payoff for Player 2 (3 points). If Player 1 plays A2, A2 yields 5 points whereas A1 yields 3. Therefore, A1 should be eliminated.
- **A0 vs. A2**: 
    - If Player 1 plays A0, A0 gives 5 and A2 gives 3.
    - If Player 1 plays A2, A0 gives 0 and A2 gives 5.
    - If Player 1 plays A1, A0 gives 0 and A2 gives 3.

### 3. Nash Equilibria and Risk Dominance
The game essentially reduces to a choice between coordinating on **(A0, A0)** or **(A2, A2)**. Both are pure-strategy Nash Equilibria with a (5, 5) payoff.
However, **(A2, A2)** is more **risk-dominant**. In a 2x2 matrix focusing on A0 and A2:
- If a player deviates from (A0, A0) to A2, they lose 2 points (5 - 3).
- If a player deviates from (A2, A2) to A0, they lose 5 points (5 - 0).
The higher penalty for deviating from A2, combined with the fact that A2 was the approved mediator choice, makes A2 the most stable and logical focal point for coordination.

### 4. Conclusion
Action A2 provides the same upside as A0 (5 points) but with significantly better insurance (3 points instead of 0) if the other player fails to coordinate or chooses A1. Given the symmetric risk profiles and the strategic setup of the mediator, A2 is the optimal choice.

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game Without Mediator**

The base game is a symmetric two-player game with the following payoffs (Player 1's payoff is listed first):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| **A1**              | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

This is a variant of a coordination game with a twist: both players prefer to coordinate on A0 (5 points each), but if one plays A0 and the other plays A1, the one playing A1 gets more (3 vs 0), and if both play A1, they both get 3.

So:
- A0-A0: best outcome (5,5)
- A0-A1: (0,3) → bad for Player 1
- A1-A0: (3,0) → bad for Player 2
- A1-A1: (3,3) → fair, but not optimal

Note: A1 is a "safe" choice because it gives at least 3 points no matter what the other player does.

But if you think strategically, A0 is dominant only if you believe the other will play A0. Otherwise, A1 gives you 3 regardless.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria of the base game.

---

### **Step 2: Nash Equilibria of Base Game**

Let’s denote:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability p
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability q

Expected payoff for Player 1 when playing A0:
> 5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q

Expected payoff for Player 1 when playing A1:
> 3q + 3(1 - q) = 3

So Player 1 is indifferent when 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

Similarly, for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0 with p, then:
  - Player 2’s payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
  - Player 2’s payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3
  - Indifference when 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So in mixed strategy Nash equilibrium: **Both play A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4**

In that case, expected payoff for Player 1:
- From A0: 5 * 0.6 = 3
- From A1: 3
→ So expected payoff = 3

But wait — is this actually the only equilibrium?

There are also pure strategy equilibria:

- (A0, A0): if you play A0, and opponent plays A0, then you get 5. If you deviate to A1, you get 3 < 5 → stable.
- (A1, A1): if you play A1, and opponent plays A1, you get 3. If you deviate to A0, you get 0 < 3 → stable.

So (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are both Nash equilibria.

But (A0,A0) is better for both players.

So rational players might want to coordinate on A0.

But can we coordinate? That’s where the **mediator** comes in.

---

### **Step 3: Understanding the Mediator**

Now, you (Player 1) have an additional action: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**

- If you **delegate**, the mediator chooses your action based on **how many players have delegated**.
- The mediator’s rule:
  - If **1 player** delegates → mediates plays A1
  - If **2 players** delegate → mediates plays A0

So:
- If **only you** delegate → mediator plays A1
- If **both you and the other player** delegate → mediator plays A0
- If **nobody** delegates → no effect

But you **must** choose a mixed strategy over A0, A1, A2.

Let’s denote:
- x = probability you play A0
- y = probability you play A1
- z = probability you play A2 (delegate)

Then x + y + z = 100 (in percentage).

You must choose z, x, y to **maximize your expected payoff**, knowing that:
- The other player also chooses a strategy (possibly different from yours)
- But the mediator’s outcome depends on **both** players’ delegation decisions

So the key is: **your decision to delegate may influence what the mediator does, and the other player’s decision does too.**

But since you are acting independently, and the game is simultaneous, you must account for the other player’s strategy.

However, the problem **does not** specify that the other player has access to the same mediator or the same options. But based on the setup:

> "You have the option to delegate... the mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting."

So it's a single mediator, and both players could choose to delegate. That implies **both players can choose A2**.

We are told: “If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1. If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.”

So:
- 0 delegates → mediator does nothing (but player still chooses independently, so your action is A0 or A1)
- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 for that player
- 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 for both players

Wait — is that correct?

Let’s re-read:

> “If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.”

This means: when only one player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** **for that player**? Or for both?

The wording is ambiguous.

But the phrase: “it will play action A1” — “it” refers to the mediator.

But **who** does it play for?

Given context: “the mediator will play an action for you” → so it plays **the action for the delegating players**.

So:
- If you delegate, the mediator picks A1 or A0 **based on number of delegators**, and **plays that action for you**.

Ah! Important point.

So:
- If only **you** delegate → mediator plays A1 for **you**
- If only the **other player** delegates → mediator plays A1 for **them**
- If **both** delegate → mediator plays A0 for **both**
- If **neither** delegates → both play their chosen A0 or A1

So the mediator’s rule is based on **how many delegate**, and it sets the **action for each delegating player**.

Therefore:
- If only you delegate → your action becomes A1 (mediator plays A1 for you)
- If only other player delegates → their action becomes A1
- If both delegate → both get A0
- If none delegate → both play their own chosen actions

This is crucial.

So your **choice to delegate** means you **let the mediator decide your action**, which depends on whether the other player also delegates.

Now, **you** choose your own strategy: what probability to play A0, A1, or A2.

But **you have no control** over the other player's choice, so you must consider **all possibilities**.

---

### **Step 4: Modeling the Game with the Mediator**

Let’s define the four cases based on delegation:

Let:
- Let your action choice: A0, A1, A2 (delegate)
- Let the other player’s choice: A0, A1, A2

But the **actual outcome** depends on:
- Whether each player delegates
- If they delegate, the mediator picks their action
- If not, their action is what they played (A0 or A1)

So the **final action** for each player is:
- If you play A2 (delegate) → your action is:
  - A1 if only you delegate
  - A0 if both delegate
- If you play A0 or A1, your action is A0 or A1 (independent)

Same for the other player.

Now, your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff**, so you need to pick a strategy (probabilities over A0, A1, A2) that maximizes your expected points **over the possible choices of the other player**.

But since you don’t know the other player’s strategy, but you are to **choose your strategy** optimally, you must assume the other player is also rational and will choose a best response.

But the question says: **"your objective is to maximize your total points"**, and you "choose a probability distribution".

So you are to pick **your own distribution** to maximize **your expected payoff**, **assuming the other player is also rational**.

But since it's a simultaneous game and no indication of mixed strategies, we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** in the extended game (with A2), and compute your best strategy.

Alternatively, the problem might expect you to pick a strategy that is **optimal** even if the other player acts adversarially or naively.

But the safe assumption is: **treat this as a symmetric game where both players are rational**, and you are to find a **symmetric equilibrium**, or at least an optimal strategy assuming the other player plays a symmetric strategy.

But since you are Player 1, and you pick your strategy, you can assume the other player may behave rationally — but you don't know how.

But the instruction is not to compute equilibrium, but to **choose a probability distribution** to **maximize your total points**.

So probably, we are to **optimize your strategy assuming the other player will choose optimally too**, so we must find a **Nash equilibrium** in this augmented game.

Let’s proceed to look for a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

Assume both players use the same strategy: play A0 with p, A1 with q, A2 (delegate) with r, where p + q + r = 100.

Let’s denote in decimal: probability of A0: p, A1: q, A2: r, p+q+r=1.

Now, let’s compute your expected payoff under this symmetric strategy, assuming the other player uses the same.

But since the game might not be symmetric due to mediation (but it is symmetric in structure), likely symmetric equilibrium exists.

Let’s define the 4 cases based on delegation:

- Case 1: Neither delegates → both play their own actions: A0 with prob p, A1 with prob q
  - Prob: (1 - r)^2
  - Your action: A0 with prob p, A1 with prob q → but conditional on not delegating

- Case 2: You delegate, other does not → you get A1 (since only one delegate), other plays their own action (A0 with p, A1 with q)
  - Prob: r(1 - r) → your choice of delegate, other doesn't

- Case 3: You don’t delegate, other does → you play your own action (A0 with p, A1 with q), other gets A1 (only one delegate)
  - Prob: (1 - r)r

- Case 4: Both delegate → both play A0 (since two delegates → mediator plays A0)
  - Prob: r^2

Now, for each case, we can compute your expected payoff.

Let’s compute your **overall expected payoff**.

---

### **Step 5: Conditional Expected Payoffs**

#### Case 1: Neither delegates (prob = (1 - r)^2)

You choose A0 with prob p, A1 with prob q

Other player chooses A0 with prob p, A1 with prob q

So your payoff:
- With prob p * p: you play A0, other A0 → you get 5
- With prob p * q: you A0, other A1 → you get 0
- With prob q * p: you A1, other A0 → you get 3
- With prob q * q: you A1, other A1 → you get 3

So expected payoff in this case:
> 5(p^2) + 0(pq) + 3(qp) + 3(q^2) = 5p^2 + 3pq + 3q^2

Note: pq + qp = 2pq, but actually it's symmetric, so total:
= 5p^2 + 3pq + 3qp + 3q^2 = 5p^2 + 6pq + 3q^2

But wait: in the product, it's over the 2×2 grid, so yes:
= 5p² + 0·pq + 3·qp + 3·q² = 5p² + 3pq + 3q² (since pq = qp)

Wait: no, if you play A0 (prob p), other plays A1 (prob q) → joint prob p*q → payoff 0
Similarly, you play A1 (q), other plays A0 (p) → joint prob q*p → payoff 3

So total:
= 5·(p·p) + 0·(p·q) + 3·(q·p) + 3·(q·q)
= 5p² + 0 + 3qp + 3q² = 5p² + 3pq + 3q²

Yes.

So case 1 payoff: **5p² + 3pq + 3q²**

---

#### Case 2: You delegate, other doesn't (prob = r(1 - r))

- You play **A1** (since only you delegate → mediator plays A1)
- Other plays A0 with p, A1 with q

So:
- If other plays A0 → you play A1, other A0 → you get 3
- If other plays A1 → you play A1, other A1 → you get 3

So **in both cases, you get 3!**

So expected payoff in this case: **3**

---

#### Case 3: You don’t delegate, other delegates (prob = (1 - r)r)

- You play A0 with p, A1 with q
- Other plays A1 (since only they delegate → mediator plays A1)

So:
- If you play A0 → you A0, other A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 → you A1, other A1 → you get 3

So expected payoff:
> 0·p + 3·q = 3q

---

#### Case 4: Both delegate (prob = r²)

- You play A0 (mediator plays A0)
- Other plays A0

So both play A0 → you get **5**

So expected payoff: **5**

---

### **Step 6: Total Expected Payoff for You**

Now, sum over all cases:

E[Payoff] =  
Case 1: (1 - r)² × (5p² + 3pq + 3q²)  
+ Case 2: r(1 - r) × 3  
+ Case 3: (1 - r)r × 3q  
+ Case 4: r² × 5

Note: Case 2 and Case 3 both have factor r(1 - r), so combine.

So:

E = (1 - r)² (5p² + 3pq + 3q²) + r(1 - r)(3 + 3q) + 5r²

Now recall: p + q + r = 1 → p = 1 - q - r

Let’s express everything in terms of q and r.

Let’s define:
- p = 1 - q - r

Now substitute.

But first, note: p² = (1 - q - r)²  
pq = (1 - q - r)q = q - q² - qr  
q² = q²

So:
5p² + 3pq + 3q² = 5(1 - q - r)² + 3(q - q² - qr) + 3q²

Compute:
(1 - q - r)² = 1 - 2q - 2r + q² + 2qr + r²

So:
5(1 - 2q - 2r + q² + 2qr + r²) = 5 - 10q - 10r + 5q² + 10qr + 5r²

3(q - q² - qr) = 3q - 3q² - 3qr

3q² = 3q²

Add them all:
= 5 -10q -10r +5q² +10qr +5r² +3q -3q² -3qr +3q²  
= 5 -7q -10r + (5q² -3q² +3q²) + (10qr -3qr) +5r²  
= 5 -7q -10r + 5q² + 7qr + 5r²

So:

5p² + 3pq + 3q² = 5 - 7q - 10r + 5q² + 7qr + 5r²

Now plug into E:

E = (1 - r)² (5 - 7q - 10r + 5q² + 7qr + 5r²) + r(1 - r)(3 + 3q) + 5r²

Now, we need to maximize E over q and r in [0,1], q ≥ 0, r ≥ 0, q + r ≤ 1.

This is complicated.

Let’s try to **guess a good strategy** and see if it works.

---

### **Step 7: Try Intuition Based on Mediator’s Rule**

The mediator encourages coordination:

- If both delegate → both play A0 → you get 5 (good)
- If only one delegates → that player plays A1 → gets 3, which is okay but not great
- But if you don’t delegate, you might play A1 or A0.

But **if both players delegate, you both play A0 → 5 points each** → better than other outcomes.

So **there’s an incentive to coordinate on delegation**.

But if only one delegates → that player gets A1 → gets 3, which could be worse than playing A0 with some probability.

But 3 is not bad.

But suppose both players **always delegate** (r = 1, q = 0, p = 0).

Then r = 1 → both delegate → both play A0 → you get 5.

So your payoff: 5

Is this stable?

Suppose you deviate: instead of delegating (A2), you play A0.

But if you play A0, and other plays A2 (delegate), then:
- You play A0
- Other delegates → that player plays A1 (since only one delegate → mediator plays A1)
So you: A0, other: A1 → you get 0

That’s **worse** than 5.

Similarly, if you play A1 instead of A2, same: you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 3 < 5.

So you **don’t want to deviate** from delegating.

Similarly, the other player won’t want to deviate.

So (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium: both delegate → both get 5.

Is it the only one?

Suppose both play A0 → (A0,A0): both get 5 — also equilibrium

But if you deviate to A2: then only you delegate → you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 3 < 5 → not profitable.

Similarly, if you play A1 instead of A0 → same, you get 3 or 0 depending — not better.

So (A0,A0) is also stable.

But (A0,A0) gives 5, same as (A2,A2)

But in (A2,A2), both get 5 — and no incentive to deviate.

But can you do better?

What if you try to play a mixed strategy?

Suppose you try to **encourage delegation**.

But if you play A2 with high probability, and the other player sees that, maybe they will also play A2 to get A0.

But unless you **both** commit to delegation, it's risky.

But in the pure strategy (A2,A2), you get 5.

Can you get more than 5?

No — maximum payoff is 5.

So 5 is the highest possible.

So if you can achieve 5 with certainty, that’s best.

Now – is there a strategy that gives you more than 5? No.

So any strategy that gives you **expected payoff 5** is optimal.

But (A2,A2) gives **exactly 5** with probability 1.

So it’s **optimal** in the sense of maximum possible.

Moreover, it's a **Nash equilibrium**.

But are there **other equilibria** that give **less**?

Yes — but we want **maximum** payoff.

Now — but in the (A2,A2) equilibrium, **both players get 5**, which is the best possible.

Therefore, you should play **A2 (delegate)** with probability 100.

But is this **stable**? Yes — as shown.

Suppose the other player also plays A2 — you get 5.

If you deviate, you get at most 3, which is less.

So best response.

Therefore, **in symmetric equilibrium**, both playing A2 is stable and optimal.

But let’s confirm: suppose you play A2 (delegate), and the other player plays A0.

Then:
- Both may not be delegating? Only you delegate → you play A1 (mediator), other plays A0 → you get 3.
- So you get 3, which is less than 5.

But if you assume the other player is rational, they will also play A2 to get 5.

So in equilibrium, they do.

But the question is: **choose a probability distribution to maximize your total points**.

So if you can **force** the other player to play A2, or coordinate, you get 5.

But you can’t force.

But if you play A2 with high probability, and the other player is rational, they will **also** play A2 to get 5.

So **the attracting equilibrium** is both delegating.

Therefore, playing **A2 with probability 100** gives you 5 with certainty (if the other does the same), and that’s the **best possible**.

If you play any mix with A0 or A1, then there’s a chance of getting 0 (e.g., you play A0, they play A1), or 3, which is worse than 5.

Only in the case where both delegate do you get 5.

So **only when you play A2 and the other does, you get 5**.

But if you play A2 with probability 1, then you **only** get 5 if the other player plays A2.

Same as if both play A2.

But is there a better strategy?

Suppose you play A0 with some probability.

But then you might get 0 if the other plays A1.

So worst possible is 0.

But in A2, best is 5, worst is 3 (if only you delegate, you get 3).

But you get 3 in that case.

Whereas in A0, you might get 0.

So **A2 is stochastically dominant**?

Let’s compare:

Suppose other player also plays A2.

Then:
- Your action: A0 (because both delegate → mediator plays A0)
- Other: A0
- Payoff: 5

Good.

Suppose you play A0 instead: same outcome: you play A0, other plays A0 → 5

Same.

But suppose you play A0, and other plays A1 (not delegate) → you get 0

While if you play A2 and other plays A1 → you play A1 (only you delegate), other plays A1 → you get 3

Better than 0.

Similarly, if other plays A0, you get 5 either way.

But when other plays A1:
- If you play A0 → you get 0
- If you play A2 → you get 3

So playing A2 is better when the other plays A1.

When the other plays A0:
- You get 5 regardless of whether you play A0 or A2

When the other plays A1:
- You get 3 if you delegate, 0 if not.

So **delegating is never worse, and sometimes better**.

In fact, **delegating dominates A0** in the sense of **first-order stochastic dominance**.

Similarly, compare A2 vs A1:

- If other plays A0:
  - You play A1 → you get 3
  - You play A2 → you get 5 → better
- If other plays A1:
  - You play A1 → you get 3
  - You play A2 → you get 3 → same

So **A2 is at least as good as A1 in all cases**, and strictly better when other plays A0.

So **A2 strictly dominates A0 and A1**?

Wait — not quite.

- A2 vs A0: worse when other plays A1? → no:

When other plays A1:
- You play A0 → you get 0
- You play A2 → you play A1 → you get 3 → better

When other plays A0 → you get 5 either way.

So A2 is **weakly better** than A0, strictly better when other plays A1.

Similarly, A2 vs A1:
- When other plays A0: A2 gives 5 vs A1 gives 3 → better
- When other plays A1: both give 3 → same

So **A2 dominates A0 and A1** — it is **weakly better in all scenarios**, and strictly better in some.

Therefore, **A2 is a dominant strategy** in this augmented game.

So **you should always delegate**.

Because no matter what the other player does, you do at least as well by delegating, and sometimes better.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is: **always delegate**.

So probability:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

This maximizes your expected payoff.

Even if you don't know what the other player does, delegating is best.

Thus, final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understanding the Base Game
This is a coordination game where:
- (A0, A0) gives us both 5 points - the best mutual outcome
- (A1, A1) gives us both 3 points
- Miscoordination gives one player 3 and the other 0

## Step 2: Analyzing My Payoffs for Each Action

**If I play A0:**
- Expected payoff = 5·P(opponent plays A0) + 0·P(opponent plays A1 or delegates with only 1 delegating)
- This is risky: I get 0 if opponent plays A1 or delegates alone

**If I play A1:**
- Expected payoff = 3 always (regardless of opponent's action)
- Guaranteed 3 points

**If I delegate (A2):**
- If opponent plays A0 or A1: mediator plays A1 for me → I get 3
- If opponent also delegates: mediator plays A0 for both → I get 5
- Expected payoff = 3·P(opponent doesn't delegate) + 5·P(opponent delegates)
- Minimum: 3 points, Maximum: 5 points

## Step 3: Comparing Options

**Key insight:** A2 (delegating) *dominates* A1:
- Both guarantee at least 3 points
- But A2 gives me 5 points if opponent delegates
- A1 always gives exactly 3 points

Therefore, I should never play A1.

**Comparing A0 vs A2:**
- A0: High risk (could get 0), high reward (5 if opponent plays A0)
- A2: Safe floor (guaranteed 3), good upside (5 if opponent delegates)

## Step 4: Strategic Reasoning

The mediator was specifically proposed by Player 2 and approved. This signals:
1. Player 2 likely intends to use it
2. It's designed to coordinate us to the best outcome (5, 5)
3. If Player 2 delegates and I also delegate, we both get 5

If Player 2 delegates and I play A0: I get 0 (mediator plays A1 against my A0)
If Player 2 delegates and I play A1: I get 3
If Player 2 delegates and I delegate: I get 5

The rational choice, given that the mediator exists specifically to coordinate us to the optimal outcome, is to delegate.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

This is a symmetric game between two players with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

This is a **coordination game with a conflict of interest**.

- If both play A0: both get 5 → best outcome for both.
- If one plays A0 and the other A1: the one playing A1 gets 3, the one playing A0 gets 0.
- If both play A1: both get 3.

So:
- A0 is best when the other plays A0.
- A1 gives a guaranteed 3, regardless of the other's action.
- A0 risks getting 0 if the other plays A1.

Hence, this is similar to a **Stag Hunt** game, where A0 is the cooperative/efficient outcome, but A1 is a safer, risk-neutral choice.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You can choose to **delegate** your move to a **mediator**, or **play independently**.

But first, **mediators are selected via approval voting**:
- You and the other player each approve (or disapprove) mediators.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So your approval vote affects:
- Whether a mediator is even eligible.
- How likely it is to be selected (if tied, more approvals → higher chance of selection).

We have two mediators:

---

### **Mediator M1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
- If **1 player** delegates → plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → plays **A0**

So:
- If only you delegate: M1 plays A1 → you get your outcome based on your own choice, but your move is A1.
- If both players delegate: M1 plays A0 → both get A0, so both get 5.

### **Mediator M2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So:
- If only you delegate: M1 plays A0 → you get what you'd get if you played A0 (but only if the other player does something).
- If both delegate: M2 plays A0 → both get A0 → both get 5.

Wait: M2 always plays A0, regardless of how many delegate.

So:
- M2 is **always A0**.
- M1 plays A1 if only one delegates, and A0 if both delegate.

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate Mediator Strategies in Terms of Outcomes**

Let’s consider the **possible outcomes** of delegation and what they imply.

#### **Case: You delegate to M1**
- If **only you delegate** (other player acts independently): M1 plays A1 → you play A1.
  - Then your outcome depends on the other player's action.
    - If they play A0 → you get 3.
    - If they play A1 → you get 3.
    - So: **you always get 3**.
- If **both delegate**: M1 plays A0 → both play A0 → both get 5.

So if you delegate to M1:
- If the other player also delegates: you get 5.
- If the other player doesn’t delegate: you get 3 (since M1 plays A1).

#### **Case: You delegate to M2**
- M2 always plays A0, regardless of how many delegate.
- So you play A0.
- Then your payoff depends on the other player's action:
  - If they play A0 → you get 5.
  - If they play A1 → you get 0.

So:
- If both delegate: you get 5.
- If only you delegate: you get 0 if other plays A1, 5 if they play A0.

But the other player's choice depends on their strategy.

---

### **Step 4: Think About Strategic Considerations**

We are in a **pre-decision phase**: we must approve or disapprove each mediator.

We **do not** yet know what the other player will do.

We must choose which mediators to **approve**, based on what we expect to happen.

But remember: **the winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum approvals**.

So if you approve both, and the other approves only one, then the one approved by both will have 2 approvals, the other 1 → so only the one with 2 approvals wins.

If you approve M1, the other approves M2 → both have 1 approval → tie → chosen at random.

If you approve only M1, the other approves only M1 → M1 wins.

So to **maximize the chance** that a good mediator wins, we should think: *Which mediator is better for us, in expectation?*

But we also need to think about **incentives and coordination**.

---

### **Step 5: Compare M1 vs M2 from Your Perspective (Player 1)**

Let’s evaluate **expected payoff** under each mediator, **conditional on your choice and belief about the other player.**

But we are **not making a choice yet** — only deciding **which mediators to approve**, **before** we know what the other player will do.

We must choose approvals **strategically**, assuming the other player is rational and wants to maximize their own points.

So we need to think: **Which mediator is more likely to lead to an outcome that benefits you, if you end up using it?**

---

#### **If M1 wins (mediator chosen):**
- M1 plays:
  - A1 when only one delegates
  - A0 when both delegates

So, if **both delegates**, you both get 5 → best outcome.

But if **only you delegate**, you play A1 → get 3 no matter what.

So, **M1 incentivizes cooperation**: if both delegate, you both get 5 → high reward.

But if you delegate singly, you get 3 — same as if you played A1 alone.

But if the other player also delegates, **you both get 5**.

So **M1 rewards mutual delegation**.

So you **prefer M1 if you think the other player will also delegate**, because then you get 5.

But if you delegate to M1 and the other doesn’t, you get only 3.

#### **If M2 wins:**
- Always plays A0 → so you play A0.
- Then:
  - If other plays A0 → you get 5.
  - If other plays A1 → you get 0.

So your payoff depends on **their choice**.

But if **both delegate**, you both get 5 → same as M1 when both delegate.

If **only you delegate**, you play A0 → get 5 **only if** the other plays A0.

But the other player might not play A0.

In fact, from their perspective:
- If they are playing independently, they prefer A1 (guaranteed 3) or A0 only if they think you’ll play A0.

So the other player is unlikely to play A0 unless they are coordinating.

Thus, under M2:
- If they play independently, they will likely play A1 → so if you delegate to M2 and they play independently, you get 0.

So M2 is **risky**: if they don’t cooperate, you get 0.

Whereas under M1:
- If they don’t delegate, you get 3 (which is better than 0).
- Only if they do delegate → you get 5.

So **M1 is risk-averse in the sense that you can’t get less than 3**, while M2 can make you get 0.

So M1 is **better in the worst case**.

Also, M1 **creates a positive incentive for mutual delegation**: if both delegate, you both benefit a lot.

M2 does **not** give such an incentive — if both delegate, you both get 5, but if only you delegate, you might get 0.

But here's a key point: **if you delegate to M2, you are playing A0, and only succeed if the other plays A0**.

But the other player, if acting independently, has **no reason to play A0 unless they think you will**.

So coordination on A0 is fragile.

In contrast, M1 gives a **better payoff** for mutual delegation (5 vs 5, same), but also gives you **3** as a **floor** if only you delegate — which is better than M2’s potential 0.

So M1 is **strictly better** than M2 **from your point of view**, in terms of **risk management and incentive alignment**.

But what about **the other player**?

Let’s think: **what do they prefer?**

They are Player 2. They want to maximize their own points.

Let’s suppose **M1 wins**:

- If only you delegate: M1 plays A1 → you play A1.
  - Then:
    - If they play A0 → they get 0 (since you played A1)
    - If they play A1 → they get 3.
    - So they will play A1 → get 3.

- If both delegate: M1 plays A0 → both play A0 → they get 5.

So they prefer **both to delegate**, since they get 5.

But if only you delegate, they get 3 if they play A1 (and will), so they get 3.

So their payoff:
- If both delegate: 5
- If only you delegate: 3
- If they delegate and you don't: M1 would be playing A1 (since only one delegate), so they play A1 → get 3.

Wait — if **they delegate**, and you don’t, then only one delegate → M1 plays A1 → so they play A1 → get 3.

So for them:
- Only you delegate: you get 3, they get 3
- Only they delegate: they get 3
- Both delegate: both get 5

So **they strongly prefer mutual delegation**, because it gives them 5.

So for **them**, M1 is **very attractive**, because mutual delegation gives 5 — the best outcome.

Now consider M2:

- Always plays A0.

So if **you delegate** to M2: you play A0.
- If they play A0 → you get 5, they get 5.
- If they play A1 → you get 0, they get 3.

So they get 3 if they play A1, 5 if they play A0.

But again, they would prefer to play A1 for a guaranteed 3, unless they believe you’ll play A0.

But if **they delegate to M2**, they play A0.
- Then:
  - If you play A0 → both get 5.
  - If you play A1 → both get 0 (because you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3, they get 0).

Wait: If they play A0 and you play A1 → they get 0.

So if **they delegate to M2**:
- If you play A0 → they get 5.
- If you play A1 → they get 0.

So they risk getting 0.

But if they play independently:
- They can play A1 → guaranteed 3.
- So **they are better off playing A1 independently** than delegating to M2, unless they are confident you’ll play A0.

So M2 creates a **risk** for them: if they delegate, and you don’t coordinate, they can get 0.

So **M2 is bad for Player 2** unless they coordinate.

Whereas M1 gives them:
- If they delegate: if only they delegate → they get 3.
- If both delegate → they get 5.

So they **never get less than 3**, and get 5 if coordination happens.

So from **their perspective**, M1 is better.

Similarly, you prefer M1 over M2 because:
- M1 gives you ≥3 in any case.
- M2 could give you 0 if they play A1 and you delegate to M2.

Also, M1 **incentivizes mutual delegation**: if both delegate, you both get 5.

So M1 is **Pareto-superior** to M2, and **has better incentives for cooperation**.

Thus, **both you and the other player would prefer M1 over M2**, if they could coordinate.

But can you **ensure** that M1 wins?

Not necessarily — it depends on approvals.

But **you can approve M1**, and **not approve M2**, so that M1 has a higher chance of winning.

Suppose you approve M1, disapprove M2.

- If the other player also approves M1 → M1 wins (2 approvals).
- If they approve M2 but not M1 → M1 still wins (1 approval).
- If they approve both → both have 1 approval → then **one is chosen at random** → 50% chance M1 wins.

So even if they approve both, **you get a 50% chance of M1 winning**.

But if you **do not approve M1**, then M1 has 0 approvals → cannot win.

So **to maximize the chance that M1 wins**, you should **approve M1**.

And **to prevent M2 from winning**, you should **disapprove M2**.

But wait — could M2 be useful?

Suppose you **approve M2**, but **not M1**, and the other approves M2: then M2 wins.

Then you play A0.

If they play A0 → you get 5.

But if they don’t → you get 0.

Whereas with M1, even if they don’t delegate, you get 3.

So M2 is riskier.

Also, as we saw, the other player is also better off with M1, since:
- M2 could make them get 0.
- M1 gives them at least 3.

So **M2 is worse for both players** than M1.

Thus, **M1 is clearly superior**.

Therefore, to **maximize your (Player 1) expected payoff**, you should:
- **Approve M1**
- **Disapprove M2**

Because:
- M1 gives you better worst-case payoff (3 vs 0).
- M1 encourages coordination on A0 (both delegate → A0 → 5,5).
- M2 gives you 0 if they play A1, but they are likely to play A1 if not coordinating.
- M1 does not risk making you get 0.
- And M1 is better for the other player too, so they are more likely to support it.

Hence, approving M1 and disapproving M2 maximizes your chances of getting the best possible mediator (M1) and avoids a worse one (M2).

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which mediators to approve in the approval voting phase.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are playing a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff Matrix (Player 1 row, Player 2 column):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

This is a variant of the **Prisoner's Dilemma** or **Stag Hunt** type game, but note:

- (A0, A0) = (5,5) is best for both.
- (A1, A1) = (3,3) is worse than (5,5), but safer.
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 0 — very bad.
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0, you get 3 — better than 0.

So, **A0 is the socially optimal** strategy (yielding 5 if both do it), but **A1 is a safer choice** (gives 3 regardless of opponent’s choice, whereas A0 gives 5 if opponent cooperates, 0 if betrayed).

This suggests a **cooperation dilemma**: both players prefer (A0, A0), but there is an incentive to defect (play A1) to avoid getting 0.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

- You and the other player **each** decide **whether to delegate** to a mediator or act independently.
- But first, **you must vote on which mediators to approve**.
- The mediator with the **most approvals** wins, and if multiple have the same max, it's chosen **uniformly at random**.

There are **two mediators proposed**:
- M1: Proposed by Player 1
- M2: Proposed by Player 2

But **both have identical behavior**:

> **Mediator (M1 and M2):**
> - If **1 player** delegates to it → plays **A1**
> - If **2 players** delegate to it → plays **A0**

So both mediators behave **identically**.

Wait — but they are **proposed by different players**. Does that matter?

Only in terms of **who proposed it** — but **we are only voting on whether to approve**, not on whose proposal wins. The behavior is identical.

So M1 and M2 are functionally **identical in behavior**.

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate the Consequences of Delegation**

Suppose you **delegate** to a mediator. Then:
- The mediator will choose an action based on **how many players delegated**.
- The mediator **won’t know your identity** — it only knows the *number* of delegations.

So:
- If **only you** delegate → mediator plays A1 (since 1 person delegated).
- If **both** you and opponent delegate → mediator plays A0.

Now, **if neither delegates**, both play independently — so we are in the original game.

Your goal: **Maximize your expected points**.

We now consider **strategic implications** of delegation.

---

### **Step 4: Consider Possible Outcomes Based on Delegation Choices**

There are 4 possible combinations of delegation decisions:

#### **Case 1: Both players delegate**
- Then 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0
- So both get (A0, A0) → **both get 5 points**

Nice! This is the optimal outcome.

#### **Case 2: One player delegates, the other acts independently**
- Then 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- The delegating player gets A1
- The independent player chooses either A0 or A1 (we'll see)

But wait: the independent player chooses an action — what will they do?

We need to think about **what rational players would do** in different scenarios.

But here’s the twist: **you are trying to decide which mediators to approve**, and the **mediator that wins is selected at random** from those with the most approvals.

Since M1 and M2 behave identically, **your approval decision only matters if you break a tie**.

But suppose you approve both — then both have 1 approval each (if no one else approves), so both are tied → random pick.

Suppose you approve only one — that one has 1 approval, the other has 0 → it wins.

But since the mediators are **identical**, it doesn’t matter which one wins.

So for your **own expected payoff**, it makes **no difference** which mediator is used — **behavior is identical**.

Thus, your choice of which to approve is **purely strategic**, to maximize the chance that a **good outcome** is achieved.

---

### **Step 5: What do we want to happen?**

We want:
- Both players to delegate → then mediator plays A0 → both get 5.

But if only one delegates, then mediator plays A1 → and the other player acts independently.

So we must consider what happens in the **one-delegate case**.

Let’s suppose you delegate. Then:
- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1.
- The other player acts independently → they will choose A0 or A1 to maximize their *own* points.

Let’s analyze what the other player would do in that case.

---

### **Step 6: What Would the Other Player Do If They Act Independently?**

Assume you delegate → you play A1.

The other player observes this? Not necessarily — but they **don’t know your action in advance** unless you signal.

But the **mechanism is simultaneous**: you decide to delegate or not, and the other player does the same — **then** the mediator acts.

So **no signaling** — it's all simultaneous.

So when choosing whether to delegate, each player must think **strategically** about what the other will do.

Let’s suppose you are trying to **induce cooperation** — i.e., get both to delegate, so mediator plays A0.

But if you delegate, and the other acts independently, you play A1 and they get to choose.

So **your action is fixed to A1 if you delegate**.

But what does the other player do?

They will choose **to maximize their own points**.

So if they are acting independently and you have delegated (so you play A1), then their options:

- Play A0: you get A1, they get A0 → you get 3, they get 0
- Play A1: you both get A1 → both get 3

So if you are playing A1, they get **0 if they play A0**, **3 if they play A1** → so they **prefer A1**.

Thus, **if only one delegates**, and the other acts independently, the independent player will play **A1**.

So the final outcome:
- Delegator: A1
- Independent player: A1
- Payoff: (3,3)

Now suppose **neither delegates**.

Then both choose independently, simultaneously.

We now have the **original game**, which is a coordination game.

What are the Nash equilibria?

- (A0, A0): both get 5 — but if one deviates to A1, they get 3 (same as if both play A1), but better than (0) — so A0 is not a strong equilibrium in strict terms.
Wait:

Let’s do best responses.

Suppose opponent plays A0:
- You: A0 → 5
- You: A1 → 3
→ Prefer A0

If opponent plays A1:
- You: A0 → 0
- You: A1 → 3
→ Prefer A1

So:
- Best response to A0 is A0
- Best response to A1 is A1

So the pure strategy Nash equilibria are:
- (A0, A0)
- (A1, A1)

But (A0, A0) is **Pareto efficient**, (A1, A1) is **inefficient**.

But if you're uncertain about what the other will do, you might play A1 to avoid the risk (0) of getting played A1.

So in practice, **both might play A1** — leading to (3,3) — even though (A0,A0) is better.

So both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are equilibria.

But (A0,A0) requires trust.

Now, back to **delegation**.

Let’s evaluate outcomes based on delegation strategy:

#### **Outcome 1: Both delegate**
- Mediator plays A0 (since 2 delegated)
- You get 5, other gets 5

#### **Outcome 2: Only you delegate**
- Mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Other player acts independently
- As shown: they will play A1 (since A1 gives them 3, A0 gives them 0 when you play A1)
- Final: (A1, A1) → payoffs (3,3)

#### **Outcome 3: Only other player delegates**
- You act independently
- You see that the other is delegating → they will play A1 (since only 1 delegate)
- So other player plays A1
- You choose independently:
  - If you play A0 → you get 0
  - If you play A1 → you get 3
→ You will play A1 → so again (A1, A1) → (3,3)

#### **Outcome 4: No one delegates**
- Both choose independently
- Can end in (A0,A0) or (A1,A1)

But the **only outcome that gives 5** is **(A0,A0)** — but both must be willing to coordinate.

If both players are risk-averse or rational, they may both play A1 — (3,3)

But **if both believe the other will play A0, they will too** — so (A0,A0) is possible.

But **without communication**, the game has **two equilibria**.

Now, **can delegation help achieve the good outcome?**

Yes: **if both delegate**, we get (5,5) — perfect.

But **if only one delegates**, we get (3,3) — same as if both play A1.

But **if no one delegates**, we could get (5,5) — but only if both coordinate.

The **key trade-off**:

- **If you delegate**, you **guarantee** that **you play A1** in the one-delegate case (because 1 delegate → mediator plays A1).
- But you **get 5 only if both delegate**.
- If only you delegate → you get 3, and the other gets 3 → same as A1,A1.

But **you lose the chance** of (5,5) unless the other also delegates.

But if the other also delegates, you gain 5.

Now, here's a **critical point**:

- The **mediator behaves based only on the number of delegations**.
- But **the mediator’s choice is deterministic** based on count.

Now, here’s the **strategic effect** of voting to approve a mediator.

Since both mediators behave identically, **approval of one or both has no functional difference**.

But we must choose which to approve.

Suppose **you approve both M1 and M2**.

Then:
- M1: approved
- M2: approved
- So both have 1 approval → tied → winner is chosen uniformly at random → either can win.

But since they behave the same, **it doesn’t matter**.

Now suppose you approve **only one**, say M1.

Then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.

Again, no difference.

So **your approval choice has no effect on outcome**.

But what if the **other player** also votes?

We don't know their preferences.

But **your goal is to maximize your expected points**.

Now, we must consider: **if you approve a mediator, you allow it to potentially be chosen**.

But since both are equivalent, it doesn't matter.

But now consider: **does approving a mediator create an incentive for the other player to delegate?**

This is the **key insight**.

Let’s suppose you **approve only one mediator**.

Then, **only that mediator** can be selected.

But if you **approve both**, then **both can be selected**, but since they behave the same, it doesn’t matter.

But **the winning mediator is determined by number of approvals**.

Suppose:
- You approve M1 only → M1 gets 1, M2 gets 0 → M1 wins.
- You approve both → both get 1 → tie → winner chosen uniformly at random → still, either M1 or M2 → same behavior.

So no difference.

But **what if the other player also votes**, and we want to **coordinate**?

But the other player is **also trying to maximize their own payoff**.

So if you approve **both**, you are **making a stronger signal**?

Not really — it's not about signaling, but about **which mediator is selected**.

But since they behave identically, it doesn’t matter.

However — **there is a strategic consideration**: **do you want to prevent the other player from blocking** the mediator?

No — because **they can only block by not approving**.

But the other player is playing strategically too.

Now, think **from your perspective**: you want to **maximize the chance of (5,5)**.

The only way to guarantee (5,5) is for **both to delegate**.

But if you delegate, you play A1 in the one-delegate case.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can still play A0 or A1.

But here’s a key thought:

> **If both players delegate, we get 5 each.**
> **If only one delegates, we get 3 each.**
> **If no one delegates, we could get 5 (if both play A0) or 3 (if both play A1).**

So your **best case** is (5,5), which can only happen in **two scenarios**:
1. Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → (5,5)
2. Neither delegate, and both play A0 → (5,5)

But the second requires **coordination** — both players must independently choose A0.

But in that case, if both play A0, you get 5.

But if one plays A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0 — very bad.

So the **risk** of (0) in the independent case is high.

Now, **delegation removes that risk**, because if you delegate, you play A1 if only one delegates — but **if both delegate, you get A0**.

So delegation **offers a way to coordinate on A0**.

But only if **both delegate**.

But how to **induce the other player to delegate**?

Suppose **you do not delegate**, and instead play independently.

Then the other player:
- Sees that you are not delegating → they know you will choose an action (A0 or A1) to maximize your payoff.

But they don’t know your action in advance.

But now suppose **you delegate**.

Then:
- You are **committed to A1 if only one delegates**.
- But **if both delegate**, you get A0.

Now, **can the other player trust** that if they delegate, you will too? Only if they believe you are rational.

But suppose both players **want** (5,5). Then each would prefer that the other delegates.

But if the other delegates, and you don’t, you get 3 (same as A1,A1) — but you could have gotten 5 if both delegated.

So there is a **mutual incentive** to delegate.

But what if **you believe the other player is rational**?

Then **you can reason**:

> “If both delegate → outcome (5,5)”
> “If only one delegates → outcome (3,3)”
> “If neither → outcome could be (5,5) or (3,3), but likely (3,3) due to risk”

So both players have **an incentive to delegate** — because (5,5) is better than (3,3), and if both delegate, you get (5,5) for sure.

But only if they **both** delegate.

So if **both are rational and want (5,5)**, they will **both delegate**, even though it’s a kind of **coordination**.

Now, back to **approval voting**.

You must decide which mediators to approve.

But here’s the **key insight**: **does it matter which mediator is chosen?**

No — both M1 and M2 behave identically.

So **approving one or both has no strategic difference**.

But suppose you approve **only one**.

Then, for the mediator to win, it must have the most approvals.

Suppose the **other player also approves a mediator**.

If the other player approves M1, and you approve only M1 → M1 wins.

If you approve both M1 and M2, and the other player approves M1 → then M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

But since both mediators behave the same, **your payoff is identical in all cases**.

So **it doesn’t matter**.

But what if the **other player doesn't approve either**?

Then:
- If you approve both → both mediators get 1 → tied → random pick → either wins → same behavior.
- If you approve only one → that one wins.

Again, no difference.

Thus, **your approval choice has no effect on the outcome**, because all mediators behave identically.

So you can **approve both** — it doesn't hurt, and doesn't help.

But could you **harm yourself** by approving a mediator?

Only if it causes a bad outcome.

But since all mediators behave the same, **no**.

But here's a twist: **are the mediators distinguishable in any way?**

No — behavior is identical.

So **you should approve both** — because:
- It doesn’t hurt you.
- It doesn’t hurt your chance of a good outcome.
- And you might help the process (but since you want to maximize your own points, and it's indifferent, you can choose either).

But is there a reason **not to approve one**?

Suppose you **disapprove M1**, but approve M2.

Then if M2 wins, you are fine — same as if M1 wins.

But suppose the other player **approves M1**, and you **don’t approve M1**.

Then M1 has one approval (the other player), M2 has one (you) → tied → random pick → M2 could win.

But same behavior.

So **no difference**.

Therefore, **your optimal strategy is to approve both mediators**.

Because:
- It doesn’t risk anything.
- It doesn’t prevent the mechanism from working.
- It ensures you don’t accidentally block the other player’s preferred mediator, but since they behave the same, it doesn't matter.

But wait — **you must maximize your points**.

Is there a **single best choice**?

Actually, **no difference** in any case.

But suppose the **other player is also rational**, and wants to get (5,5).

They will want to **increase the chance** that a mediator is selected.

But **you** can help that by approving mediators.

But **approving both** is **as good as approving one** — because the behavior is identical.

But is there a downside?

Suppose you approve **only one**, and the other player approves the **same one** → it wins.

If you approve both, and the other approves only one → the one they approved wins (if they approve the same).

But if they approve one you also approved → still wins.

So no strategic difference.

But **approving both** increases the **number of mediators that can win**, but since they are identical, it doesn't matter.

**Conclusion**: **You should approve both mediators**.

Why?

- It has no downside.
- It ensures that **no matter what**, the mediator that is selected will behave identically.
- You are not harming your own outcome.
- Since both are identical, approving both is **safe and symmetric**.

In decision theory, when options are identical, and there is no cost, **maximizing approval** is neutral.

But here, **approving both doesn’t hurt**, and might be seen as supporting coordination.

But crucially, **you cannot lose by approving both**.

Thus, the **safe, optimal decision is to approve both**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's work through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)**  
This is a strategic game between two players, Player 1 (you) and Player 2.

The payoff matrix (Player 1’s payoff):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5      | 0      |
| **P1: A1**    | 3      | 3      |

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria.

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A1

Similarly for Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 0 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So:
- Pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)
  - (A0, A0): both get 5
  - (A1, A1): both get 3

But notice: (A0, A0) is better for both players than (A1, A1), so it's the Pareto-optimal outcome.

However, (A0, A0) is **not** a dominant strategy for either player — each prefers A0 only if the other plays A0.

Still, if both players could coordinate on A0, they’d get 5 each.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the delegation twist**

You can **delegate** your move to a mediator.

But first, you and the other player **approve mediators** via **approval voting**. The mediator with **the most approvals** wins, and is **chosen uniformly at random** from those tied for the most.

Then, the mediator acts based on **how many players delegate** to it.

You can choose to:
- Act independently (choose a distribution over A0/A1)
- Or delegate to a mediator (which will enforce its own strategy based on total number of delegators)

But: **only one mediator can be in play**, and it's selected based on approvals.

So your strategy involves:
1. Approving mediators (vote for them)
2. Deciding whether to delegate or not (in the next phase)

But right now, you're only deciding **which mediators to approve**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the two proposed mediators**

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**  
- If **1 player** delegates → plays A1  
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A0  

So:
- If *only you* delegate to M1 → M1 plays A1
- If *both* delegate to M1 → M1 plays A0

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**  
- If **1 player** delegates → plays A0  
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A0  

So:
- Either way, M2 plays A0 (independent of how many delegate)

---

### **Step 4: Think about the approval voting game**

You are to decide which mediators to approve. The final mediator is the one with the **most approvals**, and if multiple have same max approvals, one is picked at **random**.

So, your decision depends on:
- What happens if M1 wins?
- What happens if M2 wins?
- Whether you prefer one over the other
- What you expect the other player to do (but you don’t know)

But since you’re trying to **maximize your own expected points**, you need to consider what each mediator would do **if chosen**.

---

### **Step 5: Consider the implications of each mediator**

Let’s suppose **M1 becomes the mediator** (winning with most approvals). Then:
- If both players delegate: M1 plays A0 → you play A0
- If only one player delegates: M1 plays A1 → that person plays A1

So:
- If you delegate to M1:
  - If the other player also delegates → you play A0
  - If the other player does not → you play A1

Similarly, if **M2 becomes the mediator**:
- Always plays A0, regardless of how many delegate.

So:
- If you delegate to M2, you play A0 (no matter who else does)

---

### **Step 6: Think about strategic consequences**

Now consider what you want.

You **prefer** A0 when the other player plays A0 (you get 5), but if the other plays A1 and you play A0, you get 0.

You'd prefer to play A1 only if the other plays A0 → you get 3.

But (A0, A0) is best for you (5), so you'd want to **coordinate** on A0.

But if both players act independently, they may not coordinate — they might play A1 to avoid getting 0 when the other plays A1, leading to (A1,A1), which gives only 3 each.

So: **delegation could help coordinate on A0**.

Let’s evaluate each mediator:

#### **M2: Always plays A0**
- If you delegate to M2 → you play A0
- This is **safe** — you get at least 3 points
  - If other plays A0 → you get 5
  - If other plays A1 → you get 0
- But you're locked in to A0, so you **lose** the chance to play A1 if it benefits you (i.e., if other plays A0, you still only get 3 instead of 5)

Wait — no: if other plays A1, and you play A0 → you get 0. So you are vulnerable.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can choose your own strategy.

But let’s think: if M2 is the mediator and you delegate, you are forced to play A0.

So if you think M2 will be the mediator, and you delegate, you play A0.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can choose a strategy.

But here’s the key: **only one mediator will be active**, and you decide whether to delegate to it.

So the decision is not whether to use M1 or M2 — you decide **which ones to approve**, so you influence **who can win**.

Then, in the action phase, you decide **whether to delegate** to the winning mediator.

So your strategy has two layers:
1. Approve mediators (influence which mediator is selected)
2. Decide whether to delegate (after mediator is selected)

---

### **Step 7: Think about your incentive when the mediator is selected**

Suppose M1 is selected. Then:
- If you delegate: you play A1 if opponent does **not** delegate, A0 if opponent **does**
- If you don’t delegate: you can choose any mixture

But since you’re trying to maximize expected payoff, you have to think ahead.

But the key is: you want to **increase the chance** that a **good mediator** is chosen (i.e., one that helps you get more than 3).

So, which mediator is better for you?

Let’s compare:

#### **Compare M1 vs M2 as mediators (if they were to be used)**

Assume that **both players act rationally** in the second phase (i.e., they choose to delegate or not based on their payoff).

Let’s suppose M1 is the mediator.

Now, what happens?

- If both delegate → both play A0 → each gets 5
- If only one delegates → that player plays A1, the other plays (their own move)

But now the other player might be doing something else.

But here’s a key idea: **you and the other player can both try to maximize your payoff**, so you need to model the **delegation game** under each mediator.

Let’s analyze each case.

---

### **Case A: M1 is the mediator (selected)**

M1:
- If 1 delegate → plays A1
- If 2 delegates → plays A0

Now, suppose you are deciding whether to delegate.

#### Subcase A1: You delegate to M1

Then:
- If other player delegates → both play A0 → you get 5
- If other player does **not** delegate → you play A1, other plays whatever they choose

But what will the other player do?

They also want to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s suppose the other player also rational.

If you delegate, and they consider their best response.

- If they delegate: both play A0 → they get 5
- If they don’t delegate: they can choose. But you are playing A1.

Suppose they play A0: they get 3 (since you play A1, they play A0 → they get 0? Wait: no)

Wait! Payoff matrix:

- You play A1, other plays A0 → you get 3, other gets 0
- You play A1, other plays A1 → you get 3, other gets 3

So if you play A1 (because you delegated to M1, and other didn’t), then:
- If they play A0 → they get 0
- If they play A1 → they get 3

So they **prefer to play A1**.

So if you delegate and they don’t, you play A1, they play A1 → both get 3.

But if they **do** delegate, then both play A0 → both get 5.

So the other player gets:
- 5 if they delegate (since you delegate → both get A0)
- 3 if they don’t delegate (both end up playing A1)

So **they prefer to delegate**.

So: if you delegate to M1, the other player will also delegate → outcome: both play A0 → you get 5.

So, **if you delegate to M1, you get 5**.

Now, what if you **don’t** delegate to M1?

Then you can choose a strategy.

Suppose you play A0.

What will the other player do?

- If they delegate: they play A1 (since only one delegate), so they play A1, you play A0 → you get 0, they get 3
- If they don’t delegate: they choose — suppose they play A0 → you both play A0 → you get 5
   - But they get 5 (from A0,A0), which is better than 3 (from A1,A0), so they would prefer to play A0 if you play A0.

So if you play A0 and don’t delegate, the other player would prefer to play A0 (if they can) — but if they delegate, they play A1 → bad for them.

So if you are playing A0 and don’t delegate, and they delegate → they play A1 → you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0, they get 3

But if they don’t delegate and play A0 → both get 5

So they prefer not to delegate and play A0.

So if you play A0, they will play A0 → you both get 5.

Wait — but if they **must** decide whether to delegate or not, and they want to maximize their payoff.

- If they delegate: they play A1 → you play A0 → they get 3
- If they don’t delegate: they play A0 → you play A0 → they get 5

So they prefer **not to delegate** and play A0.

So if you play A0 (independently), and don’t delegate, and other does **not** delegate and plays A0, then both get 5.

So outcome: (A0, A0) → 5,5

So if you do not delegate, and play A0, you get 5.

But wait — in that case, you’re playing A0, and not delegating, so you're in control.

But if you **do** delegate, you also get 5.

So same outcome.

But what if you play A1?

Suppose you don’t delegate and play A1.

Then:
- If other delegates → they play A1 → you play A1, they play A1 → both get 3
- If other doesn’t delegate → they can play A0 or A1

If they play A0 → you get 3, they get 0 → they won’t do that, they’ll play A1 → both get 3

So in any case, you get 3.

So better to play A0.

So if you don’t delegate, best you can do is play A0 → get 5 (if other plays A0), which they will.

So whether you delegate or not, **in M1 case**, you can get 5.

In both cases:
- If you delegate → other will also delegate → A0,A0 → 5
- If you don’t delegate → you play A0 → other plays A0 → 5

So you get 5 either way.

But notice: **if you delegate**, you **must** get 5 (because other will also delegate).

But if you don’t delegate, you **can** get 5 if you play A0.

But you might make a mistake — but assuming rationality, you’ll play A0.

So **under M1, you can get 5 in either case**.

But M1 has a potential drawback: **if only one player delegates**, the delegating player plays A1, which is bad (they get 0 if other plays A0).

But in equilibrium, **both will delegate** when M1 is selected, because each benefits.

So **M1 leads to (A0,A0) if both delegate**, which is good.

So M1 is good.

---

### **Case B: M2 is the mediator**

M2 always plays A0.

So:
- If you delegate → you play A0
- If you don’t delegate → you decide

Suppose you delegate to M2 → you play A0.

Then what will the other player do?

- If they delegate → they play A0 → you both get 5
- If they don’t delegate → they can play A0 or A1

If they play A0 → both get 5
If they play A1 → you get 0

So they prefer to play A0.

So they will not delegate → play A0 → you both get 5

So if you delegate to M2 → you get 5

If you don't delegate → you can play A0 → then other will play A0 → you get 5

So again, you get 5.

So under M2, you also get 5.

So **both mediators can lead to 5, if both players act rationally**.

But is there a difference?

Let’s think about **what happens if you don’t delegate**.

Under M1: if you don’t delegate, and you play A0, other will play A0 → 5.

But if you play A1, you get 3.

So you play A0.

Under M2: same thing.

So both seem equal?

But wait — is there a **risk**?

Wait: under M1, if only one player delegates, that player gets A1.

But in equilibrium, **both will delegate**, because it leads to A0.

So no one has incentive to deviate.

But under M2, even if only one delegates, the delegate still plays A0.

But in equilibrium, under M2, both play A0 anyway.

So both mediators lead to (A0,A0) in equilibrium.

So why prefer one over the other?

Wait — **what if the other player is not rational?**

But we assume both players are rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.

Still, both mediators lead to the same outcome in equilibrium.

But let’s think about the **approval phase**.

You are deciding which mediators to approve.

If you only approve M1, but the other player approves M2, then M1 has 1 approval (yours), M2 has 1 approval (theirs) → tie → randomly chosen.

Then, depending on who is selected, you get 5.

But suppose you approve **both**, and the other player approves only M2.

Then M2 has 2 approvals, M1 has 1 → M2 wins → you get 5.

But if you approve only M1, and other player approves only M1, then M1 wins → you get 5.

So in all cases, you get 5?

But is that right?

Wait — is there a case where you get less?

Let’s test.

Suppose M1 is selected, and **you don’t delegate**.

You play A0.

Then other player, to maximize their payoff:

- If they delegate → they play A1 → you play A0 → they get 0
- If they don’t delegate → they play A0 → you play A0 → they get 5

So they prefer not to delegate.

So they play A0 → you get 5.

Similarly, if you delegate to M1 → you play A1 if only one delegate, but since both will delegate, you both get A0.

But what if one player is irrational?

We assume rationality.

So in equilibrium, both will choose to delegate when M1 is selected.

Similarly for M2.

So both mediators lead to (A0,A0).

So why choose one over the other?

Wait — but M1 has a unique property: it **only plays A0 when both delegate**.

But if only one delegates, it plays A1.

But that’s not a problem because both players will **want to delegate** to get A0.

So no issue.

But here’s a key point: **M1 allows for coordination on A0 even when not both delegate in the action phase** — but only if both **do** delegate.

But what if, for some reason, one player refuses to delegate?

Then the delegator gets A1 → which is bad.

But if both are rational, that won’t happen.

So no risk.

Now: **which mediator is better for *you*?**

Wait — let’s consider **incentives**.

Suppose that M1 is selected.

If you delegate, you get A0 only if the other also delegates.

But as we saw, they will.

But suppose you **don’t** delegate.

Then you can choose to play A0.

But if you play A0 and the other plays A0, you get 5.

But if the other plays A1, you get 0.

But if you delegate, you are forced to play (A1 if only one delegates, A0 if two).

But again, equilibrium is both delegate.

But here’s a subtle point: **if you delegate to M1, you are committed** to playing A1 if only one delegates, but since both will delegate, you’re fine.

But M2 is **safer** — it always plays A0, so even if only you delegate, you get A0.

But in equilibrium, both delegate anyway.

But suppose the **other player** is not fully rational.

Then M2 is safer for you.

But we assume rationality.

But there's another point: **M1 might induce the other player to delegate more strongly**, because if they don't delegate, they get 0 (if you do), while if they do, they get A0.

But we already accounted for that.

Wait — let’s think about **what you want**.

You want a mediator that **helps you get 5**.

Both can do that.

But M1 has a **strategic feature**: it incentivizes **both to delegate**, because otherwise, the delegate gets A1.

But M2 doesn’t do that — even if you delegate and other doesn’t, you still get A0.

So M2 is more **robust** to the other player not delegating.

But in equilibrium, as we showed, both will delegate under both mediators.

But let’s consider a scenario where **you are not sure** the other will delegate.

Suppose you are risk-averse.

Then M2 is better, because even if the other doesn’t delegate, you play A0.

Under M1, if you delegate and the other doesn’t, you play A1 — and the other will play A1 too — so both get 3.

But if you are not delegating, and the other is not delegating, you play A0, they play A0 — 5.

So if you delegate to M1, and other doesn’t delegate, you get 3.

If you don't delegate, and other doesn't delegate, you get 5.

So **in that case, you are better off not delegating**.

But in equilibrium, the other will delegate, so you get 5.

But if there’s **any risk** that the other won’t delegate, then M1 is riskier.

But M2 is safer.

So for maximizing minimum payoff, M2 is better.

But we are to **maximize expected payoff**, assuming rational players.

So we assume that players will choose best responses.

Let’s suppose the mediator is M1.

Can both be in equilibrium?

- If both delegate: both play A0 → 5 each. Each gets 5.
- Suppose you deviate: don’t delegate → you can play A0 → other plays A0 → you still get 5
   - Or play A1 → get 3
   - So you don’t want to deviate to A1
- But can you benefit by **not delegating**?
   - If you don’t delegate, and play A0, and other plays A0 → you get 5 — same as before

So **no incentive to deviate** — so (both delegate) is an equilibrium.

But also (both don’t delegate) is an equilibrium?

- If both don’t delegate: both play A0 (since they prefer A0 if other plays A0) → 5
- If you unilaterally delegate: you play A1 (since only one delegate), other plays A0 → you get 0 → worse

So you don’t want to delegate.

So (both don’t delegate) is also an equilibrium.

Oh! This is critical.

So under M1, there are **two equilibria**:
1. Both **do not delegate** → both play A0 → you get 5
2. Both **do delegate** → both play A0 → you get 5

But what if **one delegates, the other doesn’t**?

- Delegator plays A1, other plays A0 → you get 3 (if you're delegator) or 0 (if you're other) → bad for the delegate

So the delegate would get 3, but if they had not delegated, and played A0 (which they will), they get 5.

So they have **no incentive** to delegate if the other doesn’t.

Similarly, if the other delegates, you get 0.

So if you expect the other not to delegate, you won’t delegate.

So **only the "no delegation" equilibrium is safe**.

But in the "both delegate" equilibrium, each player gets 5.

But if there’s **no coordination**, they might end up in the “no delegation” equilibrium.

And if both are rational, they might coordinate on the better outcome.

But **no focal point**.

So there’s a **risk** of coordination failure.

But in the "both delegate" equilibrium, each gets 5.

But if you delegate, and the other doesn’t, you get 3.

So you’re not sure.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and you play A0, and other plays A0, you get 5.

So you're safer if you **don’t delegate**.

But if you **do delegate**, you risk getting 3.

So the best response is: **don’t delegate**, because it’s safer.

But then the other player will also not delegate.

So equilibrium: both don’t delegate → both play A0 → 5

But is that the only equilibrium?

Yes, because if one tries to delegate, they get 3 instead of 5.

So the **only stable equilibrium** is **no one delegates**, and both play A0.

But in that case, you don’t need the mediator.

But the mediator is there, but you ignore it.

So if M1 is selected, you might just play A0, ignore delegation.

Then both get 5.

But under M2, if you delegate, you **must** play A0.

If you don’t, you can play A0.

But if you delegate to M2, you are forced to play A0.

But you can get 5 anyway.

But here’s the difference: **if M1 is selected, and both players are rational, they won't delegate — because it's risky — so they play independently and get 5**.

But if M2 is selected, and you delegate, you still get 5.

But you might as well not delegate.

So M2 doesn’t force anything.

But what if the other player **does** delegate?

Then under M1, if you don’t delegate, and other delegates, you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0.

But you can play A0.

But if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

But if you had not delegated, and they had, you get 0.

So you’re worse.

But if both delegate, you get 5.

But you can’t guarantee that.

So to **maximize the chance of getting 5**, you want a mediator that **forces you to play A0**, so that you can't make a mistake.

But you’re already rational — you won’t play A1 if other might play A0.

So your best response is to play A0.

So you will get 5.

But let's go back to the **approval voting**.

You want to **increase the chance** that a mediator that helps you get 5 is selected.

But both do, in equilibrium.

But here’s the key: **M1 is proposed by Player 1**, who is you.

Player 2 proposes M2.

Now, what will the other player do?

They will approve mediators that they think are good for them.

Under M1:
- If they delegate, and you don't, they play A1, you play A0 → they get 0
- If they don't delegate, they can play A0 → get 5
- So they won't delegate unless you do

So they will not approve M1, because it’s risky for them.

Under M2:
- If they delegate, they play A0 (safe)
- If they don't delegate, they can play A0 anyway
- So they are fine with it

So Player 2 will approve M2.

But will they approve M1?

Probably not — because M1 requires them to be willing to delegate, but they can get 5 without, and if they delegate and you don’t, they get 0.

So they are better off **not** approving M1.

So likely, M2 will get approval from Player 2.

Now, what about you?

You are Player 1.

If you approve M1, and Player 2 approves M2, then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 1 approval
- Tie → random choice

So 50% chance M1 wins, 50% chance M2 wins.

If M1 wins: you get 5 (as shown, in equilibrium)
If M2 wins: you get 5

So you get 5 either way.

But if you approve only M2, then:
- M2: 1 approval (yours)
- M1: 0
- So M2 wins -> you get 5

Same.

But if you approve both, then:
- M2: 1 (Player 2) + 1 (you) = 2
- M1: 1 (you)
- M2 wins -> you get 5

So same.

But is there any reason to prefer M1?

Wait — if you approve M1, and Player 2 does not approve it, then M1 has 1, M2 has 1 -> tie -> random.

Then with 50% chance, M1 is chosen.

But under M1, if it’s chosen, will you delegate?

But as we saw, you may not want to — because you might end up with A1.

But if you don’t delegate, and other doesn’t, you get 5.

But if they delegate, you get 0.

So you can coordinate on not delegating.

So you get 5.

So even if M1 is chosen, you get 5.

So no risk.

But the only difference is: **M2 is safer and more predictable**.

But for you, since you want to maximize your points, and both give 5, it doesn't matter.

But wait — is there a case where you get more than 5?

No.

Minimum is 0.

So both are fine.

But here’s a twist: **M1 has a strategy that can help when both want to coordinate**.

But we already have a way.

But let’s consider this: if you approve only M1, and Player 2 does not approve it, then tie with M2.

Then 50% M1, 50% M2.

Then expected payoff: 5.

If you approve both, M2 wins for sure (since Player 2 will approve M2), so you get 5 for sure.

So better to approve both — because then M2 wins for sure, and you get 5.

If you approve only M1, then M2 might win, but you still get 5.

So no downside.

But is there any reason not to?

Wait — what if M1 leads to a situation where you get more than 5?

No, maximum is 5.

So no.

But here’s a critical point: **under M1, if both delegate, you both get A0 -> 5**

But to delegate, you need to trust the other to delegate.

But if you approve M1, and the other player knows you approve it, and they know that you might delegate, but they won’t because it's risky, so they might not.

But you can’t coordinate.

So the best is to not delegate, play A0.

So again, you get 5.

So in all cases, 5.

So it doesn’t matter.

But let’s look back at the mediator behavior.

M2 is simpler: always plays A0.

So if it is chosen, you can choose to delegate or not, but either way, you can get 5.

M1 is more complex.

But from your perspective, **you have no advantage in approving M1**.

In fact, M1 might be harmful if the other player thinks differently.

But we have to approve or not.

So since both give the same expected payoff, and M2 is safer (always plays A0), and Player 2 will approve M2, then to increase the chance that a mediator is chosen that you can work with, you should approve M2.

But you should approve M1?

Not necessarily.

But if you approve only M2, then M2 wins for sure.

If you approve both, M2 still wins.

So no difference.

But here’s a insight: if you approve M1, and the other player does not approve it, then it's a tie between M1 and M2.

Then if M1 wins, and then you have to decide whether to delegate.

But if you delegate to M1, you play A1 if only one delegate.

But in equilibrium, the other won't delegate, so you would be the only one — so you play A1.

Then you play A1, other plays A0 -> you get 3.

But you could have played A0 independently and get 5.

So you would **not** delegate if you expect the other not to.

So you play A0, get 5.

So even if M1 wins, you get 5.

So no problem.

Therefore, approving M1 has no cost.

But does it have benefit?

No.

So you can approve both.

But is there any reason not to? No.

But let’s see the final goal: maximize your total points.

Since both mediators lead to you getting 5, regardless of choice, you should approve both to maximize the chance that a good mediator is chosen, but since M2 will win anyway if you approve both, and M2 is safe, it's fine.

But approving only M2 is also fine.

But you should approve M2, because Player 2 will approve it.

And you should also approve M1 to have a chance of M1 winning, but it’s not necessary.

However, if you approve only M2, and the other player approves only M2, then M2 wins.

If you approve M1, and they approve M2, it’s a tie, random.

Then 50% you get to have a mediator that you proposed, but it doesn't help.

So no advantage.

So to be safe, and to ensure you have a voice, you should approve both.

In fact, there is no downside to approving a mediator.

So you should approve both.

But the other player may not, but that doesn't matter.

So final answer: approve both.

But let’s think: is there any risk of M1 being selected and you getting less?

No, as shown.

So both are safe.

Therefore, you should approve both.

But let’s check the payoffs again.

Wait — in the case where both play A0, you get 5.

In all other cases, less.

But you can achieve 5.

So to maximize, you should approve both.

But the median of the question is: you are to approve or not.

So final decision:

- M1: you approve because it gives the same outcome and you proposed it
- M2: you approve because it’s safe and will likely win

So approve both.

But let’s see if there’s any reason not to.

No.

So:

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}
```

But wait — is M1 better than M2?

Let’s see.

Under M1, if both delegate, both play A0.

But to delegate, they must trust.

But under M2, always A0.

But no.

Another angle: **you are Player 1, and you proposed M1**.

So you might want to support it.

But more importantly, if you don’t approve M1, then M1 has no chance, even if the other player approves it.

But the other player is not going to approve it, as it’s risky for them.

So M1 will only win if both approve it.

But if you approve only M2, M1 has 0.

So to have any chance for M1, you must approve it.

But since M1 doesn't give you more than M2, and M2 is more reliable, you might not care.

But you can approve both.

So I see no harm.

Therefore:

**Final Answer**

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}
```

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
To determine the optimal probability distribution for Player 2, we should carefully analyze the payoffs and the influence of the mediator.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Understanding the Payoffs
1. **Player 2 (You) choose A0:**
   - Player 1 chooses A0: 5 points
   - Player 1 chooses A1: 0 points

2. **Player 2 (You) choose A1:**
   - Player 1 chooses A0: 3 points
   - Player 1 chooses A1: 3 points

3. **Player 2 (You) delegate to Mediator (A2):**
   - If no one else delegates: Mediator plays A0 (5 or 0 points).
   - If both delegate: Mediator still plays A0 (5 or 0 points).

#### Evaluating the Mediator Move
The mediator will play A0 irrespective of the number of delegations. Delegating to the mediator effectively means you're placing your chances on A0 based on Player 1's choice.

#### Determining Player 1's Strategy
Since Player 1 wants to maximize their payoffs:
- If Player 1 expects you to play A0, they might play A1 for 3 points (knowing you get 0).
- If Player 1 expects you to play A1, they might also play A1 for 3 points (mutual benefit).

#### Mixed Strategy Considerations
To avoid predictable outcomes and potential loss, it’s logical to randomize our choices. Delegation to the mediator can make you predictable (always playing A0), hence it seems beneficial to mix between A0 and A1.

A dominant strategy would be:
- Give both actions (A0 and A1) fair chances.
- Avoid full delegation to the mediator as it might lead to predictability.

### Final Strategy
Given the payoffs, equalizing the probabilities for A0 and A1 while minimizing delegation could be a balanced approach.

**Final Mixed Strategy for Player 2:**
- Probabilities:
  - A0: 45%
  - A1: 45%
  - A2 (Delegate): 10%

This ensures a mix between the direct actions and minimal reliance on the predefined mediator.

### JSON Output
```json
{"A0": 45, "A1": 45, "A2": 10}
```

response:
Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step. The goal is to **maximize your total points** (as Player 1).

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

The payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0**     | 5,5   | 0,3   |
| **P1 A1**     | 3,0   | 3,3   |

This is a **symmetric coordination game with a conflict of interest**:
- If both play A0: both get 5 → best outcome.
- If one plays A0, other plays A1: the A1 player gets 3, A0 player gets 0.
- If both play A1: both get 3.

So, A0 is better if you coordinate, but A1 is safe: you get 3 no matter what (vs. possibly 0 if you play A0 and the other plays A1).

This game has **two Nash equilibria**:
1. (A0, A0): (5,5)
2. (A1, A1): (3,3)

The (A0, A0) equilibrium is Pareto-efficient, but risky because if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you lose big (0 points). So there's a tension between cooperation and safety.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You and the other player will **first vote** (via approval voting) on which **mediator(s)** to allow in the game.

Only the **mediators with the maximum number of approvals** are candidates for being selected at random (uniformly) to mediate your move.

Then, **you can choose**:
- Whether to **delegate** to a mediator (and if so, which one is chosen at random among the top-approved ones), or
- **Act independently**, choosing your own action.

But: **your move is not locked in until after the mediator selection is finalized**.

However, for **approval voting**, you only decide **which mediators to approve**, **before** the game, and **before** knowing whether you will delegate or not.

So your approval decision is **strategic**, based on:
- What mediators are available,
- What their behavior is,
- How that might affect the outcome of the game (especially how many players delegate to them),
- And your own eventual choice (delegate or not).

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Mediator Proposals**

There are **two mediators**:

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**:
- If **1 player** delegates → plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → plays **A0**

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**:
- If **1 player** delegates → plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → plays **A0**

→ **M1 and M2 are identical in behavior**.

So the two proposed mediators are **functionally identical**.

Therefore, **their impact on the game is the same**.

---

### **Step 4: Strategic Implications of Approval Voting**

You can **approve or disapprove** each mediator.

The winning mediator is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So:
- If you approve both, and the other player approves only one, then the one with 2 approvals wins.
- If you approve both, and the other approves both, then both have 2 → winner is picked at random from {M1, M2}.
- If you approve only one, and the other approves the same one, then that one has 2 → wins.
- If you approve M1, other approves M2, then both have 1 → winner is random between M1 and M2.

But since both mediators behave exactly the same way, **the outcome doesn't depend on which one is picked**.

So **it doesn’t matter which one is selected** — the behavior is identical.

Therefore, from a **game outcome perspective**, approving either or both has the same effect **if the set of approved mediators has the same cardinality**.

---

### **Step 5: Why Would You Want to Approve a Mediator?**

Approving a mediator increases the chance it is selected, which means you can **delegate** to it later.

But **you don’t have to delegate** — you can choose to act independently.

So the value of a mediator hinges on whether **delegating to it** is better than acting independently.

Let’s compare:

#### **Delegating to M1 or M2**
- If **1 player delegates** → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players delegate** → mediator plays **A0**

So the outcome depends on **how many players delegate**.

But here’s the catch: **you don’t control** how many players delegate. The other player chooses independently.

Moreover, **you decide whether to delegate only after** the mediator is selected.

But now: **your decision to delegate** may depend on whether the mediator is likely to play a good action.

So let’s evaluate **what’s optimal**.

---

### **Step 6: What is the best strategy?**

Let’s suppose you **approve both M1 and M2**.

Then, whatever the other player does, **you’re covered**: you have a mediator to delegate to if needed.

Suppose you do **not approve** one of them.

Then, if that mediator gets more approvals, it can’t be selected — which might be bad if you wanted to delegate to it.

But since **both mediators behave the same**, **you gain nothing from rejecting one**.

Moreover, if you disapprove one, and the other player also disapproves one, then maybe the max approvals is 1, but only one mediator is approved — so that one wins.

But if you **approve only M1**, and the other player approves only M2, then both have 1 approval → both are candidates → winner is random.

But since both behave the same, it doesn’t matter.

So **you are indifferent between approving M1 or not, as long as you can still delegate when beneficial**.

But here’s the key: If you **disapprove both**, you **cannot delegate at all** → you must act independently.

But if you **approve at least one**, you might be able to delegate.

So **disapproving both** removes the possibility of delegation.

Is delegation ever better than acting independently?

Let’s test that.

---

### **Step 7: Is Delegation Better Than Acting Independently?**

Let’s suppose you **can delegate** to a mediator.

Then:
- You don’t choose your action.
- The mediator plays based on how many players delegate.

So the **number of delegates** determines the action.

Let’s suppose **you are considering delegating**.

But you don’t know how many will delegate — the other player can also delegate.

So possible states:

| # Delegating to M | Mediator plays | What happens? |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| 0                 | Not applicable | You must act independently |
| 1                 | A1             | You play A1 |
| 2                 | A0             | You play A0 |

So:
- If **only you delegate**, mediator plays A1 → you get A1.
- If **both delegate**, mediator plays A0 → you get A0.

Now, what would you get **if you acted independently**?

That depends on what you would do.

But let’s think: what is the best strategy **if you could act independently**?

In the base game, the best outcome is (A0,A0) → you get 5.

But if you play A0 unilaterally, you risk getting 0 if the others plays A1.

So what’s the optimal independent strategy?

Let’s suppose the other player is rational and might play something.

But since this is a **simultaneous** game, and you’re trying to maximize expected payoff, we should consider **Nash equilibria**.

We already know two equilibria:
- (A0,A0): both play A0 → 5,5
- (A1,A1): both play A1 → 3,3

But is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?

Suppose you play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)

Other player plays A0 with q, A1 with (1−q)

Expected payoff for you:

E = p*q*5 + p*(1−q)*0 + (1−p)*q*3 + (1−p)*(1−q)*3  
= 5pq + 0 + 3(1−p)q + 3(1−p)(1−q)  
= 5pq + 3q(1−p) + 3(1−p)(1−q)  
= 5pq + 3q − 3pq + 3(1−p−q+pq)  
= (5pq − 3pq) + 3q + 3 − 3p − 3q + 3pq  
= 2pq + 3 − 3p + 3pq  
Wait, let’s recompute carefully:

E = p q * 5  
+ p (1−q) * 0  
+ (1−p) q * 3  
+ (1−p)(1−q) * 3

= 5pq + 0 + 3q(1−p) + 3(1−p)(1−q)

= 5pq + 3q(1−p) + 3(1−p)(1−q)

Factor:

= 5pq + 3q − 3pq + 3(1−p−q+pq)

= 5pq − 3pq + 3q + 3 − 3p − 3q + 3pq

= (2pq + 3pq) + (3q − 3q) + 3 − 3p  
= 5pq − 3p + 3

So E = 5pq − 3p + 3

To find best response: fix q, take derivative w.r.t. p:
dE/dp = 5q − 3

- If 5q > 3 → q > 0.6 → best response is p = 1
- If q < 0.6 → best response is p = 0
- If q = 0.6 → any p is best response

By symmetry, same for other player.

So **mixed strategy equilibrium** occurs at q = 0.6, p = 0.6.

Then expected payoff:
E = 5*(0.6)*(0.6) − 3*(0.6) + 3  
= 5*0.36 − 1.8 + 3  
= 1.8 − 1.8 + 3 = 3

So **in mixed strategy Nash**, you get **3 points**.

In **pure strategy Nash**:
- (A0,A0): you get **5**
- (A1,A1): you get **3**

So rational players might converge to (A0,A0) if they can coordinate.

But if there’s doubt, (A1,A1) is safer.

So **expected payoff without delegation is at least 3**, possibly 5.

Now, back to **delegation**.

Suppose you **delegate**.

Then:
- If **only you delegate** (other doesn’t delegate), then **mediator plays A1** → you get A1.
- If **both delegate**, then **mediator plays A0** → you get A0.

But **you don’t know whether the other will delegate**.

And you **don’t know what the other will do** in the delegation decision.

But crucially: **you can choose to delegate or not**, after the mediator is selected.

So suppose you are **considering delegation**, but the other player is **not sure**.

But from **your perspective**, what is better?

Let’s suppose the other player is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s assume they are **symmetric in reasoning**.

Now, **if you approve a mediator**, you can later choose to delegate to it.

But is delegation **better** than acting independently?

Let’s test:

#### Case 1: You act independently, and choose A0
- If other plays A0 → you get 5
- If other plays A1 → you get 0
- So expected value depends on their behavior

But if you are optimistic, you might hope they play A0.

But if not, you risk nothing.

#### Case 2: You delegate to the mediator

You’re not choosing your action — it depends on **how many delegate**.

But here’s the irony: if **only you delegate**, mediator plays A1 → you get 3 (from A1,A1) — because you play A1, other must be playing something.

But if you didn't delegate, you could choose A0, risking getting 0.

But if you delegate, you **automatically commit** to A1 **if only one person delegates**.

But if both delegate, then you get A0.

But if both delegate, and you get A0, and the other player, if they didn’t delegate, might have played A1.

But they also have the option.

Let’s suppose that both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff.

What if both players **agree to delegate**?

Then: **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 → you play A0, other plays A0 → you get **5**.

Ah! **This is great**.

So if both players **delegate**, you get A0 → 5.

But if **only one delegates**, then you play A1 → and since the other plays independently, you get 3 or 0 depending on their action.

But if the other also delegates, you get 5.

So **if you both delegate, you get 5**.

But if only you delegate, you play A1 → then depending on the other’s choice:

- If they play A0 → you get 0 (since you play A1, they A0)
- If they play A1 → you get 3

So expected payoff from **only you delegating** is at most 3 (if they play A1), but could be 0.

So **delegating alone is risky** → you end up with A1, which gives you only 3 if they also play A1, 0 if they play A0.

But if **both delegate**, you get A0 → and they also get A0 → you get 5.

So **coordinating to both delegate** gives you a great outcome.

Is this incentive compatible?

Yes: if both delegate, you get 5 → better than 3.

So for each player, **if they believe the other will delegate**, then **delegating is good** → they get A0 and earn 5.

If they think the other won’t delegate, then if they delegate, only one delegate → they play A1 → and if the other plays A0, they get 0, if A1, they get 3 → so **risking 0**, but only getting 3 if lucky.

But if they don't delegate, they can choose A0 and get 5 if the other does, 0 if not.

Same risk.

But here’s the key:

**If you delegate and the other also delegates → you both get 5**

**If you don’t delegate, and the other doesn’t → you can still get 5 by both playing A0**

But with delegation, you **guarantee that if both delegate, you both play A0**

Without delegation, you still *could* play A0.

But delegation **forces coordination** when both delegate.

Moreover, **if both players approve a mediator, and there's only one (or both), then they can both delegate and both get 5**.

So **delegation helps achieve coordination**.

In contrast, **without delegation**, there’s a risk of miscoordination.

So **approving a mediator increases your chance of achieving the good (5,5) outcome via coordination**.

But you only get that if **both delegate**.

So the **value of the mediator** is in **enabling coordination** when both players choose to delegate.

Now, the **only issue is**: would players **want** to delegate?

Yes, **if they believe the other will delegate**.

And if **both believe that**, they both will.

So **both will delegate → get A0 → 5**.

So the **delegation mechanism allows for a self-enforcing coordination on (A0, A0)**.

But without it, players might fear the other won’t play A0, so they play A1.

So **mediation helps overcome fear and enables coordination**.

Therefore, **having a mediator available increases your chance of getting 5 points**.

Thus, **you should approve the mediators**, so that **delegation is possible**, and you can **use it to coordinate** on A0.

But now: what if you **don’t approve any mediator**?

Then you **cannot delegate** → you must play independently.

Then you're stuck in the original game: you risk getting 0 if the other plays A1.

Even in the mixed-strategy equilibrium, you only get 3 on average.

But if you **can approve a mediator**, and the other player does too, then you can both **delegating**, and **get 5**.

So **approval increases your expected payoff**.

Therefore, **you should approve both mediators**, so that you have **a higher chance** of getting the mediator selected.

And since both mediators behave the same, **you gain nothing by choosing one over the other**.

Moreover, if you disapprove one, you are **not helping** the other one have more chance, and **you risk** being the only one who can't delegate if that mediator is selected but you disapproved.

But since both are identical, it’s **better to approve both**.

---

### **Step 8: What is the best approval strategy?**

- If you **approve both**, then if the other player approves one or both, **you have access to a mediator**.
- If you **approve only one**, and the other approves only the other, then both are approved, and one is picked at random → you still have access.
- But if you **approve both**, you’re **in full control** of the set.

Moreover, **if you disapprove one**, you **hurt the chance** that the mediator can be selected.

But since both are the same, **you gain nothing from disapproving**.

In fact, **you lose** if you disapprove one and the other player approves both — then only one is available → but you still have access.

But if **you disapprove both**, then **no mediator can be selected**, so **you cannot delegate**.

Then you are locked into the original game: expected payoff 3 at best, possibly 0.

So **approving at least one** is better.

But to **maximize flexibility**, approve both.

And since the mediators are identical, you **gain nothing from excluding one**.

So **you should approve both**.

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

Approve both mediators: **M1 and M2**.

Even though they are identical, approving both maximizes the chance that a mediator is selected and available for delegation.

And delegation enables coordination on (A0,A0), giving you 5 points — better than the risk of getting 0.

So approval is beneficial.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:

- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which mediator(s) we should approve as Player 2 (the player for whom we are making decisions).

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)

The game is a 2-player simultaneous game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (you are Player 2, so first index is your action, second is other player's):

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | 5, 5 | 0, 3 |
| A1                            | 3, 0 | 3, 3 |

We can analyze this game to understand the Nash equilibria.

- If you play A0, best response:
  - If opponent plays A0: you get 5
  - If opponent plays A1: you get 0 → so you prefer A0 if opponent is playing A0.
- If you play A1, best response:
  - If opponent plays A0: you get 3 → better than 0 (if you played A0)
  - If opponent plays A1: you get 3 → same as above.

So:
- If opponent plays A0, you prefer A1 (3 > 5? no — wait! 3 < 5)
Wait — correction: if opponent plays A0:
- You playing A0 → 5
- You playing A1 → 3 → so you prefer A0

If opponent plays A1:
- You playing A0 → 0
- You playing A1 → 3 → so you prefer A1

So your best response:
- If other plays A0 → play A0
- If other plays A1 → play A1

So your best response is to match the other player.

Now for the other player:
- If you play A0: they get 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1 → prefer A0
- If you play A1: they get 0 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1 → prefer A1

So their best response: match you.

This is a coordination game with two pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- Both play A0 → (5,5)
- Both play A1 → (3,3)

Also a mixed strategy equilibrium, but we’ll focus on the pure ones.

In the absence of coordination, we might end up in (A0,A0) or (A1,A1), but A0-A0 is Pareto superior.

But now: **we have delegation and approval voting for mediators**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the delegation mechanism

You can either:
- Act independently (choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1)
- Delegate your move to a mediator

Before the game, you and the other player vote on which **mediators** to approve (via approval voting).

Only mediators with **maximum approval** can be selected (each such mediator has equal chance to be chosen). Then, the mediator plays for you based on how **many players** chose to delegate to it.

Important: **The mediator's action depends on how many players delegate to it.**

But note: The final mediator is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the maximum number of approvals.

So if you approve a mediator, you're saying: "I support this mediator being in the pool, and if it has max approvals, it's a candidate."

But the **actual delegation decision** (to delegate or not) happens **after** the approval phase, and is **not** part of this step.

So in **this step**, we are only deciding which mediators to **approve**, based on our best interests.

We are Player 2.

---

### Step 3: Look at the two mediators

#### Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

#### Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **These are identical**!

So both M1 and M2 have the exact same behavior:
- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

So from the perspective of the game outcome, they are indistinguishable.

---

### Step 4: Should we approve both? One? None?

You must approve or disapprove **each** mediator.

We need to choose **which mediator(s)** to approve, based on maximizing our **own expected payoff**, under the assumption that the final mediator is chosen *after* approvals, and then players choose whether to delegate (but delegation behavior is not under our control here — we're just deciding approvals).

But: **We do not know** how the other player will vote, or how they will act later.

But we are to **maximize our own expected points in the game**, so we want to pick mediators that will help us do that **in expectation**, given possible actions of the other player.

Since both mediators are **identical**, approving one or both gives the same set of possible mediators.

Let’s consider:

- If **neither** is approved → no mediator available → then we must act independently.
- If only M1 is approved → only M1 is available → final mediator is M1 (since max approvals = 1)
- If only M2 is approved → final mediator is M2
- If both are approved → both have 1 approval → max is 1 → so one of M1 or M2 is selected uniformly at random → so 50% chance M1, 50% chance M2

But since M1 and M2 behave **identically**, it doesn’t matter which one is chosen. So approving **both** is equivalent to approving either, in terms of outcome — **except** that approving both increases the chance that the mediator pool includes the one we want **if others try to block**.

But we are trying to **maximize our own payoff**, regardless of the other player.

Let’s suppose we approve **both**. Then, regardless of the other player’s actions:
- If the other player approves neither → we have both approved → both are in the pool → mediator chosen randomly between M1 and M2 → same behavior
- If the other player approves only one → then max approvals = 1 → both candidates in pool? Wait.

**Approval voting rule**: The winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with **the maximum number of approvals**.

So:
- If you approve both M1 and M2, and the other player approves nothing → both M1 and M2 have 1 approval → max = 1 → both are tied → random choice between them → same outcome.
- If the other player approves only M1 → then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → max = 2 → only M1 wins.
- If the other player approves only M2 → only M2 is selected.

So, if we approve both, we ensure that **whichever one the other player approves**, we are still included **if we tie**.

But what matters more is: **What strategy do we want in the game?**

We are Player 2. We want to maximize our own points.

Let’s evaluate the **mediator’s behavior** under different delegation scenarios.

---

### Step 5: What happens if we delegate?

Let’s suppose we delegate to a mediator.

Then the **actual action played** depends on **how many players delegate**.

Case 1: **Only one player delegates** → mediator plays A1

Case 2: **Both players delegate** → mediator plays A0

So the final action of the mediator depends on **delegation count**.

But we don’t know how many will delegate. The game is complex because delegation is strategic.

But we are not choosing delegation now — just **approving mediators**.

However, we can **reason about the incentive structure** to decide whether we want the mediator available at all.

Let’s compare outcomes.

Suppose both players **delegate** to the mediator:
- Then median plays A0
- So both play A0
- We get 5 points

Suppose only one player delegates:
- Mediator plays A1
- So delegated player plays A1
- The other player plays either independently or by other rules

But if the other player **does not delegate**, they choose their own action.

So if only one player delegates, then:
- The **delegated** player plays A1 (regardless of who they are)
- The **independent** player chooses their action (A0 or A1) to maximize their own payoff

Let’s suppose we are the delegated player, and we delegate.

Then:
- If only we delegate (other does not): mediator plays A1 → we play A1
- Then the other player sees us playing A1, and chooses:
  - If they play A0 → we get 0, they get 3
  - If they play A1 → we get 3, they get 3
  → So they will play A1 (better for them)
  → We get 3

If both delegate → mediator plays A0 → we play A0
- The other player, if independent, would play A0 too (since if opponent plays A0, best to play A0 → 5 vs 3), so they play A0 → we get 5

So our **expected payoff if we delegate** depends on whether the other player delegates.

Let’s say we delegate.

Then:
- If other delegates: both play A0 → we get 5
- If other does not: we play A1, other plays A1 (best response) → we get 3

So we get:
- 5 with some prob (if they delegate)
- 3 with some prob (if not)

So we get **higher expected payoff** if **both delegate**, compared to only one.

But is it rational for the other player to delegate?

Let’s analyze the game assuming the mediator is available.

But the **availability** depends on approvals.

We now consider: **Should we approve the mediator?**

We can only make it **available** if we approve it.

Suppose we **do not** approve the mediator → then **the mediator cannot be used** → we must play independently.

Then we are in the base game, and we can choose a mixed strategy.

But recall: in the base game, the two pure NE are:
- (A0, A0) → 5,5
- (A1, A1) → 3,3

So we’d prefer to coordinate on (A0,A0), but risk coordination failure.

But if we can **use a mediator**, we have a way to coordinate.

Now, if we **approve the mediator**, and the other player also approves it, then the mediator can be used.

Now, here’s the key: **The mediator's behavior is fixed**:
- One delegate → A1
- Two delegates → A0

So if both players delegate, outcome is (A0, A0) → 5,5

If only one delegates → outcome is:
- Delegated player plays A1
- Independent player chooses best response → A1 → so (A1, A1) → 3,3

So if we delegate, and other does not → we get 3
If both delegate → we get 5

So our payoff from delegating is **higher if the other player also delegates**.

But for the other player:
- If they delegate, and we don’t → they play A1
- We play independently → best response is A1 → so (A1, A1) → they get 3
- If both delegate → (A0, A0) → they get 5

So **both players benefit more from mutual delegation**.

So if both players approve the mediator, they might **both choose to delegate**, leading to (A0, A0) → 5,5

That’s a very good outcome.

But what if we **don’t** approve the mediator?

Then we must play independently.

Then we get at best 5 if we coordinate on A0 — but that requires both choosing A0.

But if we pick A0, and the other picks A1, we get 0.

So uncertainty.

But with mediation, **if both approve**, there is a **coordination device** that leads to (A0,A0) **with certainty**, if both delegate.

But the mediator’s behavior is **determined by delegation count**, not by choice.

And the mechanism is: if both delegate → play A0

If one delegates → play A1

So the only way for both to play A0 is **both to delegate**

Can we **enforce** that?

Yes — because if we are rational and both see that both delegating gives 5, and only delegating gives 3, then we both prefer to delegate if we think the other will.

There’s a **coordination incentive**: both have incentive to delegate **if they believe the other will too**.

So **if the mediator is approved by both**, and it is selected (which it will be if it’s one of the top-approved), then **both players have incentive to delegate**, leading to (A0, A0).

Thus, with approval and rational behavior, we can **achieve the payoff 5**.

Without delegation (if we don’t approve the mediator), we may not coordinate.

But: is **5** achievable independently? Yes, but only with risk.

With mediation, if both approve, we can achieve it with certainty.

So approval of the mediator increases our **chance** of getting 5.

But: **Can we guarantee that the other player will also approve?**

No — we don’t know.

But we are to **maximize our expected payoff**, assuming strategic behavior from the other player.

So we must **strategically approve mediators** to increase the chance of a good outcome.

But we are also **Player 2**, and M2 was proposed by Player 2.

Does that matter?

No — the mediator's behavior is what matters, and both M1 and M2 are identical.

So approving M2 is just as good as approving M1.

But since the mediators are identical, it doesn’t matter.

Now, **what is the best strategy?**

We want to **allow the possibility** of achieving (A0,A0) via mutual delegation.

To do that, we must have the mediator **approved**.

But there’s a **risk**: if we approve a mediator, and the other player doesn’t approve it, then it’s not available, so we’re back to independent play.

But if we **don’t approve any mediator**, then we’re forced to play independently — no coordination.

So is it better to approve one or none?

Let’s compare:

- Case 1: We approve the mediator (say M1) but the other player does not → then only we have approved → max approvals = 1 → M1 is selected → but we can still choose to delegate or not.

Wait — **we can still delegate even if the other player didn’t approve**.

The approval process is just to **select the mediator** — but **after** that, we can still choose to delegate.

So if **we approve** a mediator, and it’s selected (which it will be if it has at least one approval), then **we can delegate**.

But if **no mediator is approved**, then **no mediator is available**, so we **cannot delegate** — must play independently.

Ah! This is key.

The **winning mediator** is selected from those with **maximum approvals**.

But if **no one approves any mediator**, then there is no winning mediator → no delegation available → must play on own.

If **at least one mediator is approved**, then the **winner is selected uniformly at random** from the maximally approved ones → so **we can use the mediator** for delegation.

So:
- If we **approve at least one mediator**, then **delegation is available**.
- If we **approve none**, **delegation is unavailable** → must play independently.

Therefore, **we must approve at least one mediator** to have the option of delegation.

But we can choose **which** ones to approve.

Now, since both M1 and M2 are **identical**, **we should approve both**.

Why?

- If we approve only one (e.g., M1), and the other player also approves only M1 → then M1 has 2 approvals → chosen → we can delegate.
- But if the other player approves M2 only → M2 has 1, M1 has 1 → both have max = 1 → winner chosen at random → 50% M1, 50% M2 → same effect.

But if we approve **both**, then:
- If other player approves only M1 → M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins → we can use it
- If other player approves only M2 → M2 has 2, M1 has 1 → M2 wins → we can use it
- If other player approves both → both have 1 approval → max = 1 → so winner is chosen at random → same as above
- If other player approves none → both M1 and M2 have 1 approval (ours) → max = 1 → winner is chosen at random → still usable

So **by approving both**, we ensure that **there is always a mediator available** (since max approvals >= 1), **regardless of the other player’s actions**.

In contrast, if we approve **only one**, say M1:
- If the other player approves **nothing**, then M1 has 1, others have 0 → M1 wins → usable → ok
- But if the other player approves **only M2**, then M2 has 1, M1 has 1 → both max → winner random → still usable
- So actually, even if we approve only one, as long as we approve at least one, the mediator is always available.

Wait — yes.

So **any approval of at least one mediator ensures that the winning mediator is selected and available**.

Therefore, **we should approve at least one**.

But should we approve both?

Let’s see the difference.

Suppose we approve only M1.

- Then, if the other player also approves only M1 → M1 wins → we can use M1
- If other player approves only M2 → M1 and M2 both have 1 → M1 and M2 tied → random choice → we still can use a mediator (just not sure which)

But since M1 and M2 are identical, it doesn’t matter.

So **approving both doesn’t change outcome** — it’s the same as approving only one.

But is there any reason to prefer one over the other?

No — identical behavior.

But note: **if we approve only M1**, and the other player approves only M2, then:
- M1 and M2 both have 1 approval → so the winner is chosen uniformly at random → so 50% chance of M1, 50% M2 → we can still use the mediator

Same as if we approve both.

So in every case, if **we approve at least one**, the mediator is available.

Therefore, we **must** approve at least one to have a chance at delegation.

But since **both are identical**, we can approve either one or both.

But is there any disadvantage to approving both?

No.

But could it be worse?

Suppose that the other player hates the mediator, and we approve both, but they only approve one.

Still, the mediator is available.

And since both are identical, outcome is the same.

Therefore, **approving both is at least as good as approving only one**, and never worse.

In fact, it might prevent the other player from **blocking** the mediator.

Suppose we approve only M1.

Suppose the other player approves only M2.

Then both have 1 approval → random selection → mediator available.

Same as if we both approved both.

So no loss.

But in all cases, the mediator is available **as long as at least one of us approves at least one**.

So approval of **either** M1 or M2 is sufficient.

But since we are the one approving, and we want to **maximize our chance of getting high payoff**, we should **approve both**, because:

- It ensures that **no matter what** the other player does, we are covered.
- It doesn’t hurt.
- It doesn’t increase risk.

In fact, it might help in edge cases, though we can't see a downside.

Moreover, if the other player disapproves both, then no mediator → no delegation → back to independent play.

But that's unavoidable.

But **if we approve both**, we **increase the chance** that the mediator is selected — but actually, we don’t need to.

But the **only constraint** is that the winning mediator must be selected from those with maximum approvals.

So if we approve both M1 and M2, and the other player approves nothing, then M1 and M2 both have 1 approval → max = 1 → so one is chosen at random → mediator available.

Same as if we approved only one.

So no difference.

But here’s a key point: **if we approve only one**, and the other player approves **nothing**, then only one mediator has approval → it wins → we can use it.

But if we approve both, and the other player approves nothing → both have 1 approval → winner chosen at random → still usable.

So same outcome.

So the **only risk** is if **no one approves any mediator** → then no delegation.

But **we can control** whether we approve.

So as long as we approve **at least one**, delegation is available.

Now, since M1 and M2 are **identical**, and we have no preference between them, we should **approve both**.

Because:
- It doesn’t cost us anything
- It ensures that even if the other player approves only one, we are still in the pool
- It gives us no downside
- And in all scenarios, we get the same benefit

Moreover, suppose the other player is trying to **keep the mediator out** by not approving it.

But if we approve both, and they approve only one, we’re still in the game.

But if we approve only one, and they approve only the other, we’re still in.

So **no difference**.

But approving both is **safe**.

And since we want to **maximize our payoff**, and delegation helps us achieve (A0,A0) with coordination, we should **enable delegation**.

Therefore, we should **approve both mediators**.

---

### Final decision:

Approve both M1 and M2.

Because:
- They are identical in behavior
- Approving both ensures delegation is available regardless of the other player’s approval
- It doesn't hurt us
- It enables coordination on (A0,A0) which gives us 5 points
- Without delegation, we risk getting only 3 or 0

Hence, we should approve both.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Understanding the Game

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

This is a coordination game where mutual A0 gives the best outcome (5 points each), but A1 is safer (guarantees 3 points minimum).

## Analyzing the Mediators

**Mediator 1 (M1):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**Mediator 2 (M2):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A0
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Comparing Outcomes

**When both players delegate:**
- M1: Both play A0 → (5, 5) ✓
- M2: Both play A0 → (5, 5) ✓

**When only I delegate:**
- M1: I play A1, P1's best response is A1 → (3, 3)
- M2: I play A0, P1's best response is A0 → (5, 5) ✓✓

**When only P1 delegates:**
- M1: P1 plays A1, my best response is A1 → (3, 3)
- M2: P1 plays A0, my best response is A0 → (5, 5) ✓✓

## Strategic Assessment

M2 is strictly better for me because:
1. **Robustness**: M2 achieves the optimal outcome (5, 5) even when only one player delegates, not just when both do
2. **Safety**: M2 always plays the cooperative action A0, making coordination easier
3. **Multiple paths to success**: With M2, we reach (5, 5) whether both delegate, one delegates, or even if both just independently choose A0

M1 only achieves (5, 5) when both players delegate, otherwise falling back to (3, 3).

Since M2 maximizes my expected payoff across all scenarios, I should only approve M2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)**

The base game is a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|             | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

This is **not** a standard Prisoner's Dilemma or Coordination game, but let’s analyze it.

- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get 3
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → you get 3

Now, let's look at **dominant strategies**:

- For Player 1:  
  - If Player 2 plays A0: A0 gives 5 > A1 (3) → A0 better  
  - If Player 2 plays A1: A0 gives 0 < A1 (3) → A1 better  
  → No dominant strategy.

- For Player 2:  
  - If Player 1 plays A0: A0 gives 5 > A1 (3) → A0 better  
  - If Player 1 plays A1: A0 gives 0 < A1 (3) → A1 better  
  → No dominant strategy.

This game has **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

- (A0, A0): both get 5 → good
- (A1, A1): both get 3 → worse than (A0, A0)

There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium, but our focus is on what to do **with the mediator system**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the mediator system**

There are **two mediators proposed**, one by each player.

- **M1** (Player 1's mediator):  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

- **M2** (Player 2's mediator):  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

**M1 and M2 are identical in behavior.**

So both mediators have the **exact same action rules**.

But they come from different proposers. That matters only in **approval voting**: you get to vote on which mediators to approve, and **the mediator with the most approvals wins**, selected uniformly at random among those tied.

So ultimately, **M1 and M2 are functionally identical**.

---

### **Step 3: What happens if you delegate?**

- You choose: **delegate** or **act independently**
- But **only one mediator will be active**, based on approval voting (the one with most approvals, random tie-breaker)
- If you delegate, your **action is determined by the winning mediator** based on the number of delegations.

So if **you** delegate, and **the other player** doesn’t, then **1 player** has delegated → mediator plays **A1** (by rule)
If **both** delegate → 2 players → mediator plays **A0**

---

### **Step 4: How does delegation help?**

You control whether you delegate or not. You also influence which mediator is elected via your vote.

But here's the key: the **mediators themselves are identical in behavior**.

So **M1 and M2 do exactly the same thing**.

Therefore, **your approval of either mediator has no effect on behavior** — only number of approvals matters.

But since both do the same thing, it doesn't matter **which** one is selected — behavior is identical.

So your **only strategic choice is:**

- Should I delegate or not?
- Should I approve of M1 and/or M2?

But **appearing to approve mediators you don't want** can hurt your chance of getting the outcome you prefer.

Wait — but since M1 and M2 are identical, it doesn’t matter which is selected.

So the choice is simply: **do I approve of M1 and/or M2?**

But we need to think: **what happens if I don’t approve of both?**

Then neither wins — but the rule says: **winning mediator is selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if **no one approves of a mediator**, it can't win.

But in this case, we must **approve at least one**, otherwise no mediator is selected, and then what?

Wait — the setup doesn't say what happens if **no mediator is selected**.

But it says: "the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if **all approvals are zero**, then **no mediator has the maximum**, so no win — but that must be avoided.

But *you* are being asked to **approve or disapprove**.

You are in the game as **Player 1**, and you want to **maximize your points**.

Now, if **no mediator is selected**, then **neither** can act — but the game still needs an action.

But the rules say: *you will have the option to delegate* — implying that delegation is optional, and if not delegated, you act independently.

So if **no mediator is approved**, then **you cannot delegate**, and you must act independently.

But if you don’t delegate, you choose A0 or A1 with your own probabilities.

But the **mediator system only comes into effect if** a mediator is selected.

So: **if no mediator is selected, you act independently**.

But you can still choose to delegate — but you can’t, because there's no mediator to delegate to.

Therefore: **to delegate, you must approve of at least one mediator**, and that mediator must be selected.

But the **selection depends on approval counts**.

So if you **only approve one**, and the other player approves only the other, then both have one approval → both are tied → random selection → 50% chance M1, 50% chance M2 — but both behave the same → so outcome is the same.

But **both M1 and M2 are identical**, so it doesn’t matter which wins.

So approval of M1 and/or M2 only matters in terms of **increasing the chance that a mediator is selected**, and **whether you can delegate**.

But here’s the **key insight**:

- Both mediators behave identically.
- The outcome of the game **depends on**:
  - How many people delegate (0, 1, or 2)
  - That determines what the mediator does
  - But **if no mediator is selected, you must act independently**

So let's consider your possible strategies:

#### Strategy A: You do not delegate, and you do not approve any mediator
- Then no mediator is approved → no mediator selected → you must act independently
- The other player might delegate or not, but since you’re not delegating, and no mediator is active, your action is up to you.

But the decision to delegate is **simultaneous** with the approval phase — but actually, the sequence is:

> First, you and the other player decide which mediator to approve (via approval voting).  
> Then, based on the outcome, you choose whether to delegate or act independently.

So **approval voting happens before** delegation decisions.

Important: **You do not know who will delegate** at the time of approval.

So you must decide **in advance** which mediators to approve, **before** knowing whether the other player will delegate.

This is crucial.

So your approval decision must be strategic, based on expected outcomes.

---

### **Step 5: What should you do?**

You want to **maximize your expected points**, knowing that:

- The mediator’s action depends on **how many people delegate**
- But you can **only delegate** if **some mediator is approved and selected**
- You can **only delegate** if **you approve a mediator that ends up winning**

So to **delegate**, you must:
- Approve a mediator that gets at least one approval (so it’s in the running)
- And that mediator gets **maximum approval**, so it wins

So if you approve **only M1**, and the other player **approves only M2**, then both M1 and M2 have one approval → both are tied for max → random selection → 50% M1, 50% M2 → but they behave the same → so mediator will pick:
- If 1 delegate → A1
- If 2 delegates → A0

So **behavior is unchanged**.

Now, suppose you **approve both**, and the other player approves both.

Then all have 2 approvals → tie → random selection → still same behavior.

Now, suppose you **approve only one**, say M1, and the other player approves **neither**.

Then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.

So you can use M1.

But if you approve **neither**, and the other player approves **neither**, then **no mediator is selected** → you must act independently.

But if the other player approves **one**, say M1, then M1 has 1 approval → wins → then the other player can delegate.

But you can't delegate unless you approved a mediator that won.

So if you don’t approve any, you **cannot delegate** — you must act independently.

So **if you want to delegate, you must approve a mediator that will be selected**.

But since both M1 and M2 are identical, **it makes no difference which one wins**.

So your **strategy should be**: **approve all mediators that are not harmful**, but since both are identical and good (we'll check), approve both.

Wait — **do they help?**

Let’s evaluate whether **mediation helps**.

Suppose you commit to **delegating**, and you approve a mediator.

Then your action is determined by how many delegate.

But you don’t control the other player.

So you need to see: **what’s the best outcome you can get?**

We already know the pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): both get 5 → optimal
- (A1, A1): both get 3

So ideally, both play A0.

But if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0 → very bad.

So coordination on A0 is good.

Now, suppose **both players agree to delegate**.

Then: 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → both get 5 → perfect.

If **only one delegates**, then 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → so the delegate plays A1 → the non-delegate plays independently.

But you don’t know what they do.

Wait — **the mediator only plays for the delegate**, not both.

Important: only the delegate is assigned a move via the mediator.

If you delegate, you **must** use the mediator’s action.

The other player can choose to delegate or not.

So if **you delegate**, and the other player doesn’t, then:
- You: follow mediator → if 1 delegate → A1
- Other player: chooses independently

So you play A1, other player plays whatever they choose.

Suppose other player plays A0 → then payoff: you get 3, they get 0

But you get 3.

Or if other player plays A1 → you both get 3

So worst-case: you get 3

But if you play A0 and they play A0 → you get 5

So **in the one-delegate case**, you get **only 3** — worse than 5.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can play A0 or A1.

So **delegating risks**.

But **if both delegate**, then 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 5.

That’s great.

So **group delegation to A0** is beneficial.

But **if only one delegates**, you get A1 → which gives you 3, but you could get 5 if you played A0 and opponent played A0.

So **delegation is risky** unless you **coordinate** so both delegate.

But you can't coordinate directly.

But you can **influence** the mediator system.

---

### **Step 6: Can you use the mediator system to *induce* cooperation?**

Yes — if both players **approve the mediator**, and **both plan to delegate**, they get (A0, A0) → 5 each.

But if only one delegates, you get A1, which gives you only 3.

So only one player **wants to be the one who delegates**, to get A1.

But if both want to delegate, both get A0 → better than 3.

So **both have incentive to delegate** if they expect the other to.

But if you delegate and the other doesn't, you get stuck with A1.

So there is a **risk**.

But if you **approve the mediator**, and the other player does too, then **you can delegate**, but you don’t control whether they do.

But you could use approval to **cause win** of a desired rule.

But the mediator rules are the same for both.

---

### **Step 7: Should you approve any mediator?**

Let’s suppose you **don’t approve any mediator**.

Then, no mediator is selected.

Then you **cannot delegate** — you must act independently.

You choose your own action.

Similarly, the other player must act independently if they don’t delegate, but **if they approve a mediator**, then they can delegate.

But if **you don’t approve any**, you **cannot delegate** no matter what.

So if **only they approve**, and you don’t, they can delegate (and possibly get A1 or A0), but you are stuck acting independently.

But you can still choose A0 or A1.

In the worst case, you get 0 (if you play A0 and they play A1).

But if you play A0, and they play A0, you get 5.

So it’s possible to get 5.

But if you **do approve** a mediator, you have a chance to delegate.

But if **only you approve**, then M1 (say) has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → so you **can delegate**.

Then your action is set based on number of delegates.

But if only you delegate (the other doesn’t), then: 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 3.

If both delegate → 2 delegates → A0 → both get 5.

So expected outcome depends on what the other does.

But **you** want to maximize your points.

Can you **influence the other player** via approval?

No, not directly.

But since **both mediators are identical**, approving both is same as approving one.

But approving **one** means that mediator might not win if other player approves the other.

But if your only goal is to maximize your **own** chance to delegate, then **approving a mediator increases your chance to be able to delegate**, but only if the mediator is selected.

But if the other player approves the **other**, and you approve **this one**, then both have one — tie → random → 50% chance your mediator wins.

So you have 50% chance to delegate.

But if you approve **both**, and the other player approves **both**, then both have 2 approvals → tie → random → 50% you can delegate.

But if **both approve both**, you still only have 50% chance to use the mediator (since the winner is random).

But since both mediators are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But here’s the key: **you only care about whether you can delegate**, and **what the mediator does**.

But the mediator’s action depends on **how many people delegate**, which depends on **who delegates**.

But you **don’t control that**.

So to **get the best outcome**, you want both to delegate → then you get 5.

But if you delegate and the other doesn’t, you get 3.

So **your best outcome is 5, worst is 0 (if you play A0 and they play A1)**.

But if you **delegate**, and the other plays A1, you get 3 (since you play A1), and they get 0.

If you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can choose A0 or A1.

So you might prefer to play A0 if you expect the other to play A0.

But you don't know.

Now, **can delegation help you achieve coordination?**

Yes — **if both players approve the mediator**, and **both choose to delegate**, then both play A0 → both get 5.

But if one of you delegates and the other doesn’t, the delegate gets A1 → only 3.

So each player **fears** being the only one who delegates — because they get 3 instead of 5.

But if both delegate, both get 5.

So **both prefer to delegate if they believe the other will**.

But there’s a **coordination problem**: both want to delegate, but only if the other does.

So there is **a symmetric equilibrium in which both delegate**, provided the mediator is available.

But **if the mediator is not available**, then no delegation.

So **to enable this coordination**, you need the mediator to be selected.

But if **you don’t approve any mediator**, then **no mediator is selected** — so no delegation possible.

So you **cannot delegate**, and must play independently.

Then the game reduces to the original, with possible outcomes of (A0, A0):5, (A0,A1):0, etc.

But if you **approve at least one mediator**, you **increase the chance** that the mediator is selected and that you can delegate.

But **crucially**, since **the mediator rules are the same**, and **you can only delegate if you approved a winning mediator**, then approving **more mediators increases your probability of being able to delegate**, but only if your approval helps the mediator win.

But in this case, since both are identical, **approving both** maximizes your chance to have **a mediator win and you be able to delegate**, because:

- If others approve one, you approve both → you still have a chance
- If others approve none, you approve both → then both have 2 approvals → tie → random winner → you have 50% chance to delegate (since it’s random)

But if you approve only one, and others approve one (the other one), then it’s a tie → 50% chance.

So same in that case.

But if **others approve both**, and you approve only one, then the one you approve has 1, the other has 2 → the

Your previous response was:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)**

The base game is a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|             | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

This is **not** a standard Prisoner's Dilemma or Coordination game, but let’s analyze it.

- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get 3
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → you get 3

Now, let's look at **dominant strategies**:

- For Player 1:  
  - If Player 2 plays A0: A0 gives 5 > A1 (3) → A0 better  
  - If Player 2 plays A1: A0 gives 0 < A1 (3) → A1 better  
  → No dominant strategy.

- For Player 2:  
  - If Player 1 plays A0: A0 gives 5 > A1 (3) → A0 better  
  - If Player 1 plays A1: A0 gives 0 < A1 (3) → A1 better  
  → No dominant strategy.

This game has **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

- (A0, A0): both get 5 → good
- (A1, A1): both get 3 → worse than (A0, A0)

There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium, but our focus is on what to do **with the mediator system**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the mediator system**

There are **two mediators proposed**, one by each player.

- **M1** (Player 1's mediator):  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

- **M2** (Player 2's mediator):  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

**M1 and M2 are identical in behavior.**

So both mediators have the **exact same action rules**.

But they come from different proposers. That matters only in **approval voting**: you get to vote on which mediators to approve, and **the mediator with the most approvals wins**, selected uniformly at random among those tied.

So ultimately, **M1 and M2 are functionally identical**.

---

### **Step 3: What happens if you delegate?**

- You choose: **delegate** or **act independently**
- But **only one mediator will be active**, based on approval voting (the one with most approvals, random tie-breaker)
- If you delegate, your **action is determined by the winning mediator** based on the number of delegations.

So if **you** delegate, and **the other player** doesn’t, then **1 player** has delegated → mediator plays **A1** (by rule)
If **both** delegate → 2 players → mediator plays **A0**

---

### **Step 4: How does delegation help?**

You control whether you delegate or not. You also influence which mediator is elected via your vote.

But here's the key: the **mediators themselves are identical in behavior**.

So **M1 and M2 do exactly the same thing**.

Therefore, **your approval of either mediator has no effect on behavior** — only number of approvals matters.

But since both do the same thing, it doesn't matter **which** one is selected — behavior is identical.

So your **only strategic choice is:**

- Should I delegate or not?
- Should I approve of M1 and/or M2?

But **appearing to approve mediators you don't want** can hurt your chance of getting the outcome you prefer.

Wait — but since M1 and M2 are identical, it doesn’t matter which is selected.

So the choice is simply: **do I approve of M1 and/or M2?**

But we need to think: **what happens if I don’t approve of both?**

Then neither wins — but the rule says: **winning mediator is selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if **no one approves of a mediator**, it can't win.

But in this case, we must **approve at least one**, otherwise no mediator is selected, and then what?

Wait — the setup doesn't say what happens if **no mediator is selected**.

But it says: "the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if **all approvals are zero**, then **no mediator has the maximum**, so no win — but that must be avoided.

But *you* are being asked to **approve or disapprove**.

You are in the game as **Player 1**, and you want to **maximize your points**.

Now, if **no mediator is selected**, then **neither** can act — but the game still needs an action.

But the rules say: *you will have the option to delegate* — implying that delegation is optional, and if not delegated, you act independently.

So if **no mediator is approved**, then **you cannot delegate**, and you must act independently.

But if you don’t delegate, you choose A0 or A1 with your own probabilities.

But the **mediator system only comes into effect if** a mediator is selected.

So: **if no mediator is selected, you act independently**.

But you can still choose to delegate — but you can’t, because there's no mediator to delegate to.

Therefore: **to delegate, you must approve of at least one mediator**, and that mediator must be selected.

But the **selection depends on approval counts**.

So if you **only approve one**, and the other player approves only the other, then both have one approval → both are tied → random selection → 50% chance M1, 50% chance M2 — but both behave the same → so outcome is the same.

But **both M1 and M2 are identical**, so it doesn’t matter which wins.

So approval of M1 and/or M2 only matters in terms of **increasing the chance that a mediator is selected**, and **whether you can delegate**.

But here’s the **key insight**:

- Both mediators behave identically.
- The outcome of the game **depends on**:
  - How many people delegate (0, 1, or 2)
  - That determines what the mediator does
  - But **if no mediator is selected, you must act independently**

So let's consider your possible strategies:

#### Strategy A: You do not delegate, and you do not approve any mediator
- Then no mediator is approved → no mediator selected → you must act independently
- The other player might delegate or not, but since you’re not delegating, and no mediator is active, your action is up to you.

But the decision to delegate is **simultaneous** with the approval phase — but actually, the sequence is:

> First, you and the other player decide which mediator to approve (via approval voting).  
> Then, based on the outcome, you choose whether to delegate or act independently.

So **approval voting happens before** delegation decisions.

Important: **You do not know who will delegate** at the time of approval.

So you must decide **in advance** which mediators to approve, **before** knowing whether the other player will delegate.

This is crucial.

So your approval decision must be strategic, based on expected outcomes.

---

### **Step 5: What should you do?**

You want to **maximize your expected points**, knowing that:

- The mediator’s action depends on **how many people delegate**
- But you can **only delegate** if **some mediator is approved and selected**
- You can **only delegate** if **you approve a mediator that ends up winning**

So to **delegate**, you must:
- Approve a mediator that gets at least one approval (so it’s in the running)
- And that mediator gets **maximum approval**, so it wins

So if you approve **only M1**, and the other player **approves only M2**, then both M1 and M2 have one approval → both are tied for max → random selection → 50% M1, 50% M2 → but they behave the same → so mediator will pick:
- If 1 delegate → A1
- If 2 delegates → A0

So **behavior is unchanged**.

Now, suppose you **approve both**, and the other player approves both.

Then all have 2 approvals → tie → random selection → still same behavior.

Now, suppose you **approve only one**, say M1, and the other player approves **neither**.

Then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.

So you can use M1.

But if you approve **neither**, and the other player approves **neither**, then **no mediator is selected** → you must act independently.

But if the other player approves **one**, say M1, then M1 has 1 approval → wins → then the other player can delegate.

But you can't delegate unless you approved a mediator that won.

So if you don’t approve any, you **cannot delegate** — you must act independently.

So **if you want to delegate, you must approve a mediator that will be selected**.

But since both M1 and M2 are identical, **it makes no difference which one wins**.

So your **strategy should be**: **approve all mediators that are not harmful**, but since both are identical and good (we'll check), approve both.

Wait — **do they help?**

Let’s evaluate whether **mediation helps**.

Suppose you commit to **delegating**, and you approve a mediator.

Then your action is determined by how many delegate.

But you don’t control the other player.

So you need to see: **what’s the best outcome you can get?**

We already know the pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): both get 5 → optimal
- (A1, A1): both get 3

So ideally, both play A0.

But if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0 → very bad.

So coordination on A0 is good.

Now, suppose **both players agree to delegate**.

Then: 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → both get 5 → perfect.

If **only one delegates**, then 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → so the delegate plays A1 → the non-delegate plays independently.

But you don’t know what they do.

Wait — **the mediator only plays for the delegate**, not both.

Important: only the delegate is assigned a move via the mediator.

If you delegate, you **must** use the mediator’s action.

The other player can choose to delegate or not.

So if **you delegate**, and the other player doesn’t, then:
- You: follow mediator → if 1 delegate → A1
- Other player: chooses independently

So you play A1, other player plays whatever they choose.

Suppose other player plays A0 → then payoff: you get 3, they get 0

But you get 3.

Or if other player plays A1 → you both get 3

So worst-case: you get 3

But if you play A0 and they play A0 → you get 5

So **in the one-delegate case**, you get **only 3** — worse than 5.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can play A0 or A1.

So **delegating risks**.

But **if both delegate**, then 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 5.

That’s great.

So **group delegation to A0** is beneficial.

But **if only one delegates**, you get A1 → which gives you 3, but you could get 5 if you played A0 and opponent played A0.

So **delegation is risky** unless you **coordinate** so both delegate.

But you can't coordinate directly.

But you can **influence** the mediator system.

---

### **Step 6: Can you use the mediator system to *induce* cooperation?**

Yes — if both players **approve the mediator**, and **both plan to delegate**, they get (A0, A0) → 5 each.

But if only one delegates, you get A1, which gives you only 3.

So only one player **wants to be the one who delegates**, to get A1.

But if both want to delegate, both get A0 → better than 3.

So **both have incentive to delegate** if they expect the other to.

But if you delegate and the other doesn't, you get stuck with A1.

So there is a **risk**.

But if you **approve the mediator**, and the other player does too, then **you can delegate**, but you don’t control whether they do.

But you could use approval to **cause win** of a desired rule.

But the mediator rules are the same for both.

---

### **Step 7: Should you approve any mediator?**

Let’s suppose you **don’t approve any mediator**.

Then, no mediator is selected.

Then you **cannot delegate** — you must act independently.

You choose your own action.

Similarly, the other player must act independently if they don’t delegate, but **if they approve a mediator**, then they can delegate.

But if **you don’t approve any**, you **cannot delegate** no matter what.

So if **only they approve**, and you don’t, they can delegate (and possibly get A1 or A0), but you are stuck acting independently.

But you can still choose A0 or A1.

In the worst case, you get 0 (if you play A0 and they play A1).

But if you play A0, and they play A0, you get 5.

So it’s possible to get 5.

But if you **do approve** a mediator, you have a chance to delegate.

But if **only you approve**, then M1 (say) has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → so you **can delegate**.

Then your action is set based on number of delegates.

But if only you delegate (the other doesn’t), then: 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 3.

If both delegate → 2 delegates → A0 → both get 5.

So expected outcome depends on what the other does.

But **you** want to maximize your points.

Can you **influence the other player** via approval?

No, not directly.

But since **both mediators are identical**, approving both is same as approving one.

But approving **one** means that mediator might not win if other player approves the other.

But if your only goal is to maximize your **own** chance to delegate, then **approving a mediator increases your chance to be able to delegate**, but only if the mediator is selected.

But if the other player approves the **other**, and you approve **this one**, then both have one — tie → random → 50% chance your mediator wins.

So you have 50% chance to delegate.

But if you approve **both**, and the other player approves **both**, then both have 2 approvals → tie → random → 50% you can delegate.

But if **both approve both**, you still only have 50% chance to use the mediator (since the winner is random).

But since both mediators are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But here’s the key: **you only care about whether you can delegate**, and **what the mediator does**.

But the mediator’s action depends on **how many people delegate**, which depends on **who delegates**.

But you **don’t control that**.

So to **get the best outcome**, you want both to delegate → then you get 5.

But if you delegate and the other doesn’t, you get 3.

So **your best outcome is 5, worst is 0 (if you play A0 and they play A1)**.

But if you **delegate**, and the other plays A1, you get 3 (since you play A1), and they get 0.

If you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can choose A0 or A1.

So you might prefer to play A0 if you expect the other to play A0.

But you don't know.

Now, **can delegation help you achieve coordination?**

Yes — **if both players approve the mediator**, and **both choose to delegate**, then both play A0 → both get 5.

But if one of you delegates and the other doesn’t, the delegate gets A1 → only 3.

So each player **fears** being the only one who delegates — because they get 3 instead of 5.

But if both delegate, both get 5.

So **both prefer to delegate if they believe the other will**.

But there’s a **coordination problem**: both want to delegate, but only if the other does.

So there is **a symmetric equilibrium in which both delegate**, provided the mediator is available.

But **if the mediator is not available**, then no delegation.

So **to enable this coordination**, you need the mediator to be selected.

But if **you don’t approve any mediator**, then **no mediator is selected** — so no delegation possible.

So you **cannot delegate**, and must play independently.

Then the game reduces to the original, with possible outcomes of (A0, A0):5, (A0,A1):0, etc.

But if you **approve at least one mediator**, you **increase the chance** that the mediator is selected and that you can delegate.

But **crucially**, since **the mediator rules are the same**, and **you can only delegate if you approved a winning mediator**, then approving **more mediators increases your probability of being able to delegate**, but only if your approval helps the mediator win.

But in this case, since both are identical, **approving both** maximizes your chance to have **a mediator win and you be able to delegate**, because:

- If others approve one, you approve both → you still have a chance
- If others approve none, you approve both → then both have 2 approvals → tie → random winner → you have 50% chance to delegate (since it’s random)

But if you approve only one, and others approve one (the other one), then it’s a tie → 50% chance.

So same in that case.

But if **others approve both**, and you approve only one, then the one you approve has 1, the other has 2 → the

play A0, you get 5.\n\nSo it’s possible to get 5.\n\nBut if you **do approve** a mediator, you have a chance to delegate.\n\nBut if **only you approve**, then M1 (say) has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → so you **can delegate**.\n\nThen your action is set based on number of delegates.\n\nBut if only you delegate (the other doesn’t), then: 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get

only one who delegates — because they get 3 instead of 5.\n\nBut if both delegate, both get 5.\n\nSo **both prefer to delegate if they believe the other will**.\n\nBut there’s a **coordination problem**: both want to delegate, but only if the other does.\n\nSo there is **a symmetric equilibrium in which both delegate**, provided the mediator is available.\n\nBut **if the mediator is not available**, then no delegation.\n\nSo **to enable this coordination**, you need the mediator to be selected.\n\nBut if **you don’t approve any mediator**, then **no mediator is selected** — so no delegation possible.\n\nSo you **cannot delegate**, and must play independently.\n\nThen the game reduces to the original, with possible outcomes of (A0, A0):5, (A0,A1):0, etc.\n\nBut if you **approve at least one mediator**, you **increase the chance** that the mediator is selected and that you can delegate.\n\nBut **crucially**, since **the mediator rules are the same**, and **you can only delegate if you approved a winning mediator**, then approving **more mediators increases your probability of being able to delegate**, but only if your approval helps the mediator win.\n\nBut in this case, since both are identical, **approving both** maximizes your chance to have **a mediator win and you be able to delegate**, because:\n\n- If others approve one, you approve both → you still have a chance\n- If others approve none, you approve both → then both have 2 approvals → tie → random winner → you have 50% chance to delegate (since it’s random)\n\nBut if you approve only one, and others approve one (the other one), then it’s a tie → 50% chance.\n\nSo same in that case.\n\nBut if **others approve both**, and you approve only one, then the one you approve has 1, the other has 2 →

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
We are playing a strategic game with a twist involving a mediator. Let’s go step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediator)**

This is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

This is **not** a standard coordination or prisoner's dilemma, but has interesting properties.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria of the base game (without delegation).

---

### **Step 2: Find Nash Equilibria of Base Game**

Let’s look for pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): Both get 5. If P1 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no incentive. If P2 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → no incentive. So this is a **Nash equilibrium**.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3. If P1 switches to A1, gets 3 > 0 → will deviate. So not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0. If P2 switches to A1, gets 3 > 0 → will deviate. So not equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): Both get 3. If P1 switches to A0, gets 0 < 3 → no incentive. If P2 switches to A0, gets 0 < 3 → no incentive. So this is also a **Nash equilibrium**.

So pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Now check for mixed strategy equilibria.

Let:
- P1 play A0 with probability p
- P2 play A0 with probability q

We compute expected payoffs.

P1’s expected payoff from A0:
- If P2 plays A0: 5 → prob q
- If P2 plays A1: 0 → prob 1-q
→ EU(A0) = 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q

P1’s expected payoff from A1:
- If P2 plays A0: 3 → prob q
- If P2 plays A1: 3 → prob 1-q
→ EU(A1) = 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

In mixed strategy equilibrium, P1 must be indifferent between A0 and A1:

5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

Similarly for P2:
- EU(A0) = 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- EU(A1) = 3p + 3(1-p) = 3
Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So there is a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** where both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

So possible equilibria:
- (A0,A0)
- (A1,A1)
- (p=0.6, q=0.6)

---

### **Step 3: Introduce the Mediator — "Delegate" (A2)**

Now, you have a new action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

The mediator will play:
- A0 if **1 or 2** players delegate to it.

Important: The mediator plays **A0** in both cases (1 delegate or 2 delegates). So no matter how many people delegate (1 or 2), the mediator plays A0.

So:
- If you delegate (A2), then your action becomes A0 (since mediator plays A0).
- If you don’t delegate, you choose A0 or A1.

But note: **Both players** can delegate. So we may have:
- 0 delegates
- 1 delegate (either you or the other)
- 2 delegates (both)

The mediator will play A0 if 1 or 2 delegates.

So if **you delegate**, your action becomes A0, regardless of what the other player does.

If **you don’t delegate**, you choose A0 or A1.

But the **other player** can also choose to delegate. So if both delegate, both actions become A0.

If only you delegate, you get A0, other player’s action depends on what they do.

If neither delegates, both choose independently.

So we need to model this as a **3-action game** for each player: A0, A1, A2.

But we need to decide **your** strategy — you are Player 1, and you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Let’s denote your strategy:
- Probability of A0: x
- Probability of A1: y
- Probability of A2 (delegate): z
- x + y + z = 1

We'll analyze what’s optimal to do.

---

### **Step 4: What Happens When You Delegate?**

If you choose A2 (delegate), then:
- Your action is A0 (mediator plays A0 regardless of number of delegates).
- So no matter what the other player does, you get A0.

Now, the other player’s action depends on their choice.

But here's a key point: **the other player sees your strategy and can respond**. So we want to consider **perfect Bayesian equilibrium**, or at least reasonable beliefs.

But we don’t know the other player’s rationality or strategy. But we must assume they also want to maximize their payoff.

We are to choose a **strategy** (distribution over A0, A1, A2), **assuming the other player also behaves optimally**.

But we have to make a **best response** to what the other player might do.

Alternatively, since both players are rational and symmetric (except that mediator was proposed by player 2 and selected), but not necessarily symmetric in preferences.

But let’s look for **equilibrium strategies**.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze the Effects of Delegation**

Let’s suppose **you** delegate (A2). Then:
- You play A0.
- The other player can:
  - Play A0 → you get 5
  - Play A1 → you get 0
  - Or delegate → then you both play A0 → you get 5

So if you delegate, your payoff depends on the other player’s action:

- If they play A0 → you get 5
- If they play A1 → you get 0
- If they delegate → you get 5

So **you are better off if the other player plays A0 or delegates**.

But if you delegate, the other player knows you are playing A0.

So what would be their optimal response?

Let’s look at **their** payoff in each case.

Suppose **you** have delegated → you play A0.

Then, for the other player:

- If they play A0: get 5
- If they play A1: get 3
- If they delegate: they get A0 → so if you are A0, they get 5

So their best response is:
- They prefer A0 or delegate → both give 5
- A1 gives only 3 → worse

So they will **never** choose A1 if you are delegating (since A0 and delegate both give 5 > 3).

Thus: **if you delegate, the other player will play either A0 or delegate** → both give you 5 points.

So **if you delegate, you get 5 points, no matter what the other player does** (since they won’t play A1).

That’s strong!

So:
> **If you delegate to the mediator, you are guaranteed 5 points**, regardless of what the other player does.

Because they will not choose A1 (gets 3 < 5), so they will choose A0 or delegate → both result in them playing A0 → you get 5.

So **delegation guarantees you 5 points**.

Now compare to other options:

What is the maximum you can get without delegating?

Without delegating, you choose A0 or A1.

If you play A0, you expect:
- If other plays A0: 5
- If other plays A1: 0
- If other delegates: 5
So if you play A0, you get 5 unless the other plays A1.

But if the other plays A1, you get 0 → bad.

Similarly, if you play A1:
- If other plays A0: you get 3
- If other plays A1: you get 3
- If other delegates: you get 3 (since them playing A0 → you get 3)

So: **if you play A1, you always get 3**, **no matter** what the other player does.

Because:
- If other plays A0: you get 3
- If other plays A1: you get 3
- If other delegates: they play A0 → you get 3

So **A1 guarantees you 3 points**.

Compare:
- A0: depends on other player. If they play A1 → you get 0 → risk.
- A1: always 3
- A2 (delegate): always 5

So **delegation gives you 5**, **A1 gives you 3**, **A0 gives you varying** (max 5, min 0).

Therefore, **A2 (delegate) dominates both A0 and A1**, in terms of **guaranteed payoff**.

And **you can achieve 5 with certainty via delegation**, while A0 has risk.

So rational player would **prefer delegation over A0 and A1**, unless they are forced to play something else.

But wait — is delegation always safe?

Yes. Because:
- When you delegate, you get A0.
- The other player, knowing you are A0, will not play A1 (gets 3 < 5), so they will either play A0 or delegate → both give you 5.

So **you get 5 for sure**.

No risk.

Therefore: **Delegation is strictly better than A0 (which can give you 0)** and **better than A1 (which only gives 3)**.

So you should **always** delegate?

But wait — what if the other player **also** delegates?

Then both of you delegate → both play A0 → you get 5 → still good.

Same as if only one delegates.

So **no harm in delegating**.

In fact, delegating guarantees 5.

Now, is there any reason **not** to delegate?

Only if the other player might behave irrationally — but we assume rational play.

But perhaps there's a **strategic consideration**: if you delegate, you give up flexibility — but in this case, delegation gives you a better **minimum payoff** than any other action.

Therefore, **delegation is a dominant strategy?**

Wait — is it dominant?

Let’s test: is delegation always better than A0 and A1, **regardless** of what the other player does?

**Scenario 1: Other player delegates**

- You play A0: you get 5 (since they play A0)
- You play A1: you get 3
- You play A2 (delegate): you play A0 → get 5

So A0 and A2 are tied at 5, A1 gives 3 → better to choose A2 or A0.

**Scenario 2: Other player plays A0**

- You play A0: 5
- You play A1: 3
- You play A2: 5
→ again, A2 and A0 better than A1

**Scenario 3: Other player plays A1**

- You play A0: get 0
- You play A1: get 3
- You play A2: you get A0 → other plays A1 → payoff: 0

Wait! **Critical point!**

If **you delegate**, and the **other player plays A1**, then:
- You play A0
- They play A1 → you get 0 points

But earlier we assumed they **won’t** play A1 if you delegate because they can get 5 by playing A0 or delegating.

But this is **only true if they are rational**.

So if you delegate → they know you play A0.

Then for them:
- Play A0 → get 5
- Play A1 → get 3
- Delegate → get 5

So they **will not play A1** — they will choose A0 or delegate, both give 5.

Therefore, **as long as they are rational, they will not play A1 if you delegate**.

So you **do not** face the case where you delegate and they play A1.

Because that is not a best response.

Therefore, **if you delegate, the other player will respond with A0 or delegate**, so you get 5.

So your **guaranteed payoff from delegating** is **5**, **in equilibrium**.

Therefore, **delegation is safe and leads to 5**.

Now consider playing A0: suppose you play A0.

Then:
- If other plays A0 → you get 5
- If other plays A1 → you get 0
- If other delegates → they play A0 → you get 5

So if other plays A1, you get 0.

But is it rational for them to play A1 when you play A0?

No! Because:
- They get 5 if they play A0
- They get 3 if they play A1
- They get 5 if they delegate

So they **will not play A1** — they will play A0 or delegate.

So if **you play A0**, they **still won’t play A1** → so you get 5.

So playing A0 also leads to 5, **as long as they are rational**.

But wait — this is different.

So: **if you play A0**, and they are rational, they won’t play A1 — so you get 5.

Similarly, if **you delegate**, they won’t play A1 — you get 5.

So both A0 and A2 give you 5, if the other player is rational.

But A1 gives only 3.

So why would you ever play A1?

You wouldn’t.

So your optimal pure strategy should be either A0 or A2.

But A2 gives you the same payoff (5) but with the same risk?

Wait — **no risk**: both A0 and A2 give you 5 **when the other player is rational**.

But what if you are uncertain about the other player’s rationality?

No — we assume both players are rational and will choose best responses.

But is **A2 strictly better**?

Wait — when you delegate, **you** are guaranteeing your action to be A0.

When you play A0, you are choosing the action — but the other player still knows you play A0.

So **in both cases**, if you choose A0 or delegate, your action is A0, and they respond rationally.

So the outcome is the same: both play A0 → you get 5.

So **A0 and A2 give same payoff** in equilibrium.

But is there a difference in **equilibrium selection**?

Only if **there is a chance** the other player plays A1.

But if you play A0 or delegate, they know you are playing A0 → they won't play A1 → so you’re safe.

So **both A0 and A2 give you 5**, **A1 gives 3**.

So why would you choose A2 over A0?

Or is there a reason?

Wait — what if the other player is **not** rational? But we assume rationality.

Another angle: **is delegation a weakly dominant strategy**?

Let’s test dominance.

Suppose the other player plays a mixed strategy.

But in equilibrium, we expect them to play only A0 or delegate (since A1 gives only 3).

But let’s suppose the other player plays a strategy where they put some probability on A1.

But if you play A0 or delegate, they know you play A0.

Then, if they play A1, they get 3.

But if they play A0 or delegate, they get 5.

So they have **no incentive to play A1** — it's strictly dominated.

So **in rational play**, A1 is never played.

Therefore, **the other player will never play A1** in any equilibrium.

Thus, for you:
- If you play A0 or A2 → you get 5 (since other never plays A1)
- If you play A1 → you get 3

So **A0 and A2 are both strictly better than A1**.

Now, **is there any reason to prefer A0 over A2? Or vice versa?**

Not in terms of payoff.

But **delegation has no downside**.

But A0 is fine.

However, we must consider: **can you do better than 5?**

Maximum possible payoff is 5 — in (A0,A0) outcome.

So 5 is the best.

So both A0 and A2 give you 5 in equilibrium.

But what if both players are uncertain?

Wait — if **you** delegate, then **you** are not choosing — you are letting mediator choose A0.

But if you play A0 directly, you **are** choosing it.

But the outcome is the same.

But here's a **key insight**: **if you delegate, you are not playing A0 — you are delegating**.

But in the payoff, when you delegate, you get A0.

So payoff is same.

But now consider: is there a **way** to get **more than 5**? No.

So 5 is max.

So optimal is to get 5 with certainty.

So you should **not** play A1 — because it only gives 3.

Now, between A0 and A2: both give 5.

But **delegation gives you 5 with certainty**, and **A0 also gives 5** if the other player is rational.

But is there **any case** where A0 fails?

Only if other player plays A1 — but they won’t, because it’s dominated.

Therefore, both A0 and A2 give you 5.

But wait — **A0 has no downside**? It's fine.

But there’s a **subtlety**: **delegation is a new action**, and it may affect beliefs.

But in this case, **no** — because if you delegate, you send signal "I am playing A0".

If you play A0, you also send the same signal.

So **equilibrium outcomes are the same**.

But **delegation is guaranteed to get you A0**, while if you play A0, you **intentionally** play A0.

But in this game, **there’s no difference** in outcome.

So why would you ever play A0 instead of A2?

Maybe if you are risk-averse? But here, both are certain 5.

But wait — **A2 might be better if you fear that the other player might think you might play A1**.

But no — if you play A0, you are not signaling anything else.

But here’s a twist: **what if the other player believes you might not be rational**?

But the problem says we assume rational players.

Since **A2 leads to A0**, and **A0 leads to A0**, and **both are safe**, and **A2 has no downside**, while **A0 is not worse**, but **why not delegate**?

But there’s **no reason to prefer A0 over A2**, unless there’s a cost.

There is no cost.

But let’s think about **strategic stability**.

Suppose **you play A0**, but the other player thinks: "Could this be a mistake?" But no — rational player will not play A1.

But delegation **guarantees** that you are not playing A1.

But in any case, you are not.

But the point is: **both A0 and A2 get you 5 in equilibrium**.

But **A2** has the advantage that **you don’t have to choose A0** — you delegate.

But **no harm in doing so**.

But is there a **reason not to delegate**?

Only if the mediator is not reliable — but the problem says it’s selected via approval voting and will do what it says: play A0 if 1 or 2 delegates.

So **it’s trustworthy**.

Therefore, **delegation is safe**.

But now, could **delegation be better** than A0?

Yes, if **there is uncertainty** about whether the other player will play A0.

But in our analysis, **they must**.

But consider if **both players delegate** — you both get A0 → you get 5.

Same as if both play A0.

So no difference.

But what if **you** play A0, and **the other player** is unsure whether you are playing A0 or not?

But no — if you play A0, it’s clear.

But **delegation is a signal**.

But the outcome is the same.

So **A0 and A2 are payoff-equivalent**.

But **A2 has no downside** — it's safe.

But **A0 is not risky**, either.

So both are acceptable.

But now: **can you get more than 5**? No.

So you want to get 5.

But **what if you mix**?

Suppose you play A0 with 100% — you get 5.

Suppose you play A2 with 100% — you get 5.

Suppose you play A0 and A2 both — you still get 5.

But if you play A1 at all, you get only 3 when the other plays A0 or delegates — which they will.

So **A1 is dominated** by both A0 and A2.

So **you should never play A1**.

Therefore, your strategy should have **0% on A1**.

Now, should you play A0 or A2?

Since both give the **same guaranteed payoff**(5) in equilibrium, and both are safe, you can **play either or both**.

But to **maximize your expected payoff**, 5 is the maximum possible.

So any mix of A0 and A2 is fine, as long as A1 = 0.

But is there a **reason to prefer one over the other**?

Only if one is **more robust**.

But both are.

But note: **if you delegate**, and the other player sees it, they might think: "Oh, maybe they are trying to signal something?"

But no — you are just delegating to play A0.

But in equilibrium, that’s fine.

But here's **a key point**: **the mediator plays A0 whether 1 or 2 delegate**.

So **even if both delegate**, it plays A0.

So **no risk**.

But now: **if you delegate, your action is fixed to A0**, and you are not playing a strategic action.

But you **are not losing anything**.

But suppose you are **very risk-averse**, or **want to avoid playing A0** for some reason — but no, playing A0 is fine.

But no incentive.

But let’s consider a **mixed strategy**: if you play A0 with 50%, A2 with 50%, A1 with 0%, you still get 5.

So no change.

But the question is: **what is the optimal strategy?**

Since A0 and A2 give same payoff, and A1 gives less, we can put probability on both.

But **is there a way to do better?** No.

But here’s a twist: **if you delegate, you are not exposing yourself to the risk of the other player playing A1**, but that risk doesn’t exist.

But **delegation ensures you avoid choosing A0 or A1**, but still gives A0.

But since A0 is fine, it’s not a problem.

But there is **no reason not to delegate**, and **no reason to play A0**.

But playing A0 is not worse.

But let’s consider **what the other player might do**.

Suppose you delegate — you play A0.

Other player sees that — but they don’t see *how* you played A0 — only that you played A0.

But if you play A0 directly, same.

So no information difference.

But **delegation might be seen as a commitment** to A0.

Which is what you want.

But since both are equivalent, we can choose.

But to **maximize points**, and since 5 is max, and A2 guarantees it, while A0 also does, but A2 is **a different action**.

But the problem allows any distribution.

Now, is there any **disadvantage** to using A2?

For example, if the mediator were to play A1 when 2 delegate, but it doesn’t — it plays A0.

So no.

Therefore, **A2 is safe and gives 5**.

But **A0 is also safe and gives 5**.

However, **in the equilibrium, both players might coordinate on (A0,A0)**.

But if you play A0, it’s not guaranteed unless the other plays A0.

But we argued they will.

So both are fine.

But now, here’s a **key insight**: what if **you play A0**, but the other player thinks you might be indifferent?

But no — the structure is symmetric.

But let’s think about **your optimal strategy given that the other player is rational**.

They will never play A1.

So they will play A0 or delegate.

So your payoff from:
- A0: 5 (because they won't play A1)
- A1: 3
- A2: 5

So **A0 and A2 are both better than A1**.

So you should only assign positive probability to A0 and A2.

Any mix is fine.

But to **maximize points**, we need to **maximize expected payoff**, and both give 5.

So any (x, z) with x+z=100, y=0 gives 5.

But is there a reason to choose one over the other?

Let’s consider the **case where the other player delegates**.

- If you delegate: you play A0 → other plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0: same

Same.

But now consider: **if you are uncertain** about the other player’s strategy.

But we assume rationality.

But suppose the other player is trying to **minimize your payoff**.

But no — they are maximizing their own.

Their payoff is the same: if you play A0 or delegate, they can get 5 by playing A0 or delegating, and 3 by playing A1 — so they will choose one of the 5s.

So no issue.

Therefore, **no difference** between A0 and A2.

But the mediator was **selected by approval voting**, so it is trusted.

But you can use it.

But to **choose the best strategy**, since both A0 and A2 give 5, and A1 gives 3, and you want to maximize expected payoff, **any strategy with 0% on A1 and 100% on a mix of A0 and A2 is optimal**.

But the problem asks for **a** probability distribution.

So we need to pick **one**.

Now, can we do better than 5? No.

But is **A2** better? Not in payoff.

But **A2** is safer in the sense that you are not choosing A0 — but it's the same.

But here’s a **strategic advantage**: if you **delegate**, and the other player knows you delegated, they still won’t play A1 — same as if you played A0.

But delegation might be **seen as a commitment**.

But still, not better.

However, let’s consider a **mixed strategy**.

Suppose you play A0 with 100% → you get 5.

Suppose you play A2 with 100% → you get 5.

But now, what if the other player is not sure whether you will play A0 or delegate?

But in equilibrium, they will react rationally.

But the point is: **you get 5 anyway**.

So no difference.

But **why not delegate?** It’s a free option.

And it doesn’t hurt.

In fact, **delegation has no downside**.

And it’s available.

So **delegating is as good as playing A0**, and better than A1.

Therefore, you should **play A2 with 100%**.

But is there a **reason to mix**?

Only if you are uncertain.

But we assume rationality.

Alternatively, if you play A0 with positive probability, it might be interpreted as not delegating, but again, no harm.

But the best choice is to **delegate**, because:
- It guarantees 5
- It’s a pure strategy
- It’s safe

And since A0 and A2 are equivalent, you can choose either.

But to **maximize points**, and since delegation is a valid option, and gives you 5, and you have no incentive to play A0 or A1, and A2 is a way to **commit to A0**, which is safe.

Moreover, if there is a **small chance** the other player might misperceive, but we assume rationality.

So, **we can safely choose to delegate**.

Thus, the optimal strategy is to **always delegate**.

So your probability distribution:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

But let's double-check:

- If you delegate (100%), you play A0.
- Other player, seeing that, won't play A1 (gets 3 < 5), so plays A0 or delegates → you get 5.
- So you get 5.

If you played A0 with 100%, same thing.

But why not delegate?

No disadvantage.

And it’s a valid action.

Therefore, **A2 = 100%** is optimal.

But is there any scenario where delegating is worse than A0?

Only if the other player plays A1 — but they won’t, because 3 < 5.

So no.

Therefore, the best is to **delegate**.

So final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's carefully analyze this decision-making game step by step, keeping in mind the objective: **maximize your own total points over time**, in a repeated-round setting (implied by "total points received in the game").

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

The base game is a simultaneous move game with the following payoff matrix for **Player 1 (you)** and **Player 2 (the other player)**:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5,5    | 0,3    |
| **P1: A1** | 3,0    | 3,3    |

This is a variant of a coordination game with asymmetric payoffs and a coordination incentive.

Let’s identify the Nash equilibria in the base game (without delegation).

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria:
- (A0, A0): If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 5 vs 3 → so P2 prefers A0. If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 5 vs 3 → P1 prefers A0. So (A0,A0) is a NE.
- (A1, A1): If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 3 vs 0 → P2 prefers A1. If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 vs 0 → P1 prefers A1. So (A1,A1) is also a NE.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, but could deviate to A1 and get 3 → not stable.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3, but could deviate to A0 and get 5 → not stable.

So two pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

But notice:
- (A0,A0) gives 5,5 → better for both.
- (A1,A1) gives 3,3 → worse for both.

So (A0,A0) is a Pareto-optimal outcome.

But can we coordinate on (A0,A0)? Not always, because if one player fears the other will play A1, they might play A1 to avoid 0.

Now, consider mixed strategies.

Let’s suppose:
- You play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p).
- Other player plays A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q).

Your expected payoff:
- From A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- From A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

You are indifferent when:
5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So if other player plays A0 with 60%, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

So your best response:
- If q > 0.6 → A0 is better.
- If q < 0.6 → A1 is better.
- If q = 0.6 → indifferent.

Similarly, for the other player:
- If you play A0 with p:
  - Their payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
  - From A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3
  - Indifference when 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So the unique symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is:
- Both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

In that case, your expected payoff is:
- From A0: 5×0.6 = 3.0
- From A1: 3.0
- So overall: 3.0

But wait — is that really optimal? The (A0,A0) equilibrium gives 5, which is better.

So the mixed Nash equilibrium is inefficient. However, if you can coordinate on (A0,A0), you get more.

But **the twist is delegation** — now, you can delegate your move to a mediator.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You have a new action: A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"

- **If you delegate (choose A2)**, then the mediator plays **your action**, based on how many players have delegated:
  - If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A1
  - If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0

Important: The mediator acts **based on the number of delegators** — so it's a function of **the total number of players who delegate**.

There are only two players: you (Player 1) and the other player.

So:
- Case 1: Only you delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Case 2: Only the other player delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → the other player plays A1
- Case 3: Both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0
- Case 4: Neither delegates → no delegation → both play their own strategy

So delegation can be used to **coordinate outcomes**.

Let’s now analyze **what outcomes are possible** via delegation.

---

### **Step 3: Possible Outcomes Based on Delegation Choices**

We are Player 1. We choose a strategy: probabilities over A0, A1, A2.

The other player chooses their own probabilities.

But we are trying to choose a strategy that **maximizes our expected payoff**, knowing that the other player will also be optimizing.

Let’s think about how delegation can be used strategically.

---

### **Key Insight: Delegation as a Coordination Device**

The mediator’s behavior is **designed to coordinate**:
- If both delegate, you both play A0 → get 5 each → excellent.
- If only one delegates, that player plays A1.
- If no one delegates, both play their own strategies.

So if **both** players delegate, they **automatically get (A0, A0) and 5 points each**.

This is superior to **both playing A1 (3), or the mixed Nash (3), or even if both play A0 independently** — but independent A0 gives 5 too, but may not be stable.

However, if you delegate, **you give up control** — and you **must trust** the other player to also delegate.

Why would the other player delegate?

Let’s see.

Suppose you **consider delegating**.

- If you delegate and the other **does not**, then you play A1 (because only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1) → you get **3** (from A1 vs A0: gains 3).
- If you delegate and the other **does**, then you play A0 and get **5**.
- If you don’t delegate, you play choose A0 or A1, depending on your mix.

So if you are willing to delegate, you are hoping the other player will too.

But the other player faces the same trade-offs.

Let’s consider the incentives.

---

### **Step 4: Can Both Players Be Encouraged to Delegate?**

Suppose both players **commit to delegate** with certainty.

Then:
- 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both get 5.

So this is a **mutually beneficial outcome**.

Is this a **Nash equilibrium**?

Suppose both **always delegate** (A2 with 100%).

Then each gets 5.

Now, suppose **you** deviate and play A0 instead of A2.
- The other player is still delegating → so one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1? Wait, no:

Wait — if you do **not** delegate, then only the **other player** delegates → so **1 delegate** → mediator plays A1 → so the **other player** plays A1.

But **you** are playing A0 (your choice). So overall:
- You: A0, other: A1 → you get **0** (from the payoff table).

That’s worse than 5 → so you don’t want to deviate.

Similarly, if you play A1 instead of A2:
- You play A1, other plays A1 (because only one delegate → mediator plays A1) → both play A1 → you get 3 → still worse than 5.

So if both commit to delegate, **no player wants to deviate** — because any deviation leads to worse outcome for you.

Therefore, **(Delegate, Delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium**.

In fact, it’s a strict Nash equilibrium: **any deviation gives you 0 or 3 < 5**.

So this is a **very stable and beneficial outcome**.

Now, what about other equilibria?

Suppose you don’t delegate — then you play A0 or A1.

But if the other player is likely to delegate, then:
- If you play A0 → you get 0 (if other plays A1) or 5 (if other plays A0)
- But if other delegates, they play A1, so you get 0 if you play A0
- If you play A1 (independent), you get 3 vs A1

So better to play A1 (3) than A0 (0) if other is delegating.

But you can also delegate and get 5!

So if you **think** the other will delegate, **you should delegate** to get 5.

Similarly, if the other knows you will delegate, they should too.

So **(A2, A2)** is **the only equilibrium** where both players get more than 3.

Now, can non-delegation be an equilibrium?

Suppose both play A0 (independent) — outcome A0,A0 → both get 5.

Is this stable?

If you unilaterally deviate to A1, you get 3 (vs A0) → worse.

So (A0,A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But **only if both players play A0 with certainty**.

But if one of you is unsure, or if you randomize, it breaks.

But the **problem is coordination**: if you both play A0, you get 5 — but if one thinks the other might play A1, they might hesitate.

But here, **delegation gives a guaranteed way to coordinate on A0**, **without requiring belief in the other's choice** — it's self-enforcing.

---

### **Step 5: Consider Your Strategy — What Should You Do?**

We are trying to **maximize expected payoff**.

Now, suppose you use a **mixed strategy** that includes A2.

Can we derive the best strategy?

Let’s suppose that both players **symmetrically** consider delegating.

But note: the mediator’s action depends on the **number of delegators**, not who they are.

So it’s symmetric.

Now, here's the catch: **if both players delegate, outcome is A0,A0 → both get 5**.

But if only one delegates, the delegator gets A1 → guaranteed 3.

And the non-delegator can play A0 or A1, but if they play A0, they get 0 (because delegator plays A1) → worse.

So let’s suppose the other player uses a strategy:

- With probability x, they delegate (A2)
- With probability (1−x), they play A0 or A1 (mixed)

You have to choose your strategy.

But since the game is symmetric (both players have same payoff structure and same options), **the optimal symmetric strategy** might be to **both delegate with some probability**.

But let’s test: if both delegate **with certainty**, you get 5.

If both delegate with 100%, you get 5.

And we’ve already checked: it’s a Nash equilibrium — no incentive to deviate.

Moreover, it’s **Pareto dominant** over (A0,A0) when there is risk — because (A0,A0) can be broken by one player playing A1, but (A2,A2) is stable.

So **why not just always delegate?**

But wait — **can you truly commit to delegate?**

Yes — delegation is a choice, and the mediator only acts when you choose A2.

So if you choose A2 with 100%, then:

- If the other player also chooses A2: both play A0 → you get 5
- If the other player does not choose A2: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 3 (if other plays A0) or 3 (if other plays A1) → in both cases, you get 3.

Since other player chooses independently, and you don't know their choice, **your expected payoff depends on their probability of delegating**.

So suppose you commit to A2 = 100%.

Let the other player delegate with probability q.

Then:
- With probability q: both delegate → you get 5
- With probability (1−q): only you delegate → you get 3

So your expected payoff:  
**5q + 3(1−q) = 3 + 2q**

This is **increasing in q**.

If q is high, you do well.

But you can’t control q.

However, you are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**, and you **choose your strategy**.

Suppose you don’t delegate — what happens?

Suppose you play A0 with probability p0, A1 with p1, and A2 with p2 = 1−p0−p1.

But the key insight is: **if you delegate with 100%, you can get 5 if the other delegates**.

But **you don't control** whether they delegate.

But here's the key: **you can “threaten” to delegate** to force coordination.

But since both are rational and want to maximize points, if you **always delegate**, then the other player, knowing that:
- If they delegate, both get 5 (good)
- If they don't, they get 3 if you delegate (because you play A1)

Wait — if you delegate (A2), and they don’t delegate, then:
- You play A1 (because only 1 delegate)
- They play their own strategy.

So if they choose A0 → you get 0, they get 3
If they choose A1 → you get 3, they get 3

So **they get 3 in either case**.

But if they delegate, they get 5.

So **they have a strict incentive to delegate** if you delegate!

Because:
- If you delegate and they don’t: they get 3
- If they delegate: they get 5

So **no matter what strategy they play (A0 or A1), they get higher payoff if they delegate** (5) than if they don’t (3).

Therefore, **if you delegate with 100%, the other player will always prefer to delegate**.

Because 5 > 3.

So you can **guarantee a 5-point outcome** by **always delegating**.

And the other player will **then also delegate** — because otherwise they get only 3.

So **(A2, A2)** is not just a Nash equilibrium — it’s **the only rational outcome** in a sense.

Because if you choose to delegate, it **induces** the other player to also delegate.

Therefore, **your best strategy is to delegate with 100% probability**.

But wait — let’s confirm.

Suppose you **only have a chance to delegate**, but you can commit.

Suppose you choose to delegate.

Then:
- If the other player does not delegate → you play A1 → you get 3
- But **if they don’t delegate**, they are not benefiting — they get 3, while they **could get 5** by delegating.

So they will delegate.

So you can **successfully coordinate on (A0,A0)** by committing to delegate.

But is there any reason to not delegate?

Suppose you hesitate: you don’t delegate.

Then you play A0 or A1.

But if you play A0, and the other plays A0, you get 5 — same as delegation.

But if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0.

But if you delegate, you get 5 (if other delegates) or 3 (if they don’t).

But as we just saw, **they will delegate if you do** — because otherwise they get 3 < 5.

So **by delegating, you guarantee your own outcome is 5**.

But if you don’t delegate, you have **no guarantee**: you might get 0, 3, or 5.

Moreover, if you don’t delegate, the other player **might** play A1 — and you might get 0.

But if you delegate, **you get at least 3**, and typically 5.

But in fact, you get **5** for sure — **if the other player is rational**.

Therefore, **delegating is strictly better**.

But what if the other player is not rational? Then delegation might hurt.

But the problem assumes **decision-making game with another player** — we are told to **maximize our points**, so we assume the other player is **rational and self-interested** — same as us.

So we can assume they will choose the action that maximizes their own payoff.

Therefore, **if you delegate, they will delegate too** — because it gives them 5 > 3.

So you get (A0,A0), 5 points.

If you don’t delegate, you might get less, but you could try to play A0.

But if you play A0, and the other player plays A1 (for any reason), you get 0.

Whereas if you delegate, you **cannot get 0** — minimum is 3.

And in fact, you get 5 with certainty.

So delegation is **dominant**.

Wait — is it?

Could you do better than 5?

No — maximum possible is 5.

So 5 is best possible.

And if you delegate with 100%, you get 5 **with certainty**, **provided the other player is rational**.

And if the other player is not rational, you still get at least 3.

But if you don’t delegate, you might get 0.

So **delegation is strictly better in expectation**.

Even if you mix, delegating is risk-free in terms of **minimum payoff**, and gives highest **expected payoff** if the other is rational.

But let’s suppose you don’t delegate: you play A0 with probability p.

But unless p=1, you risk being exploited.

But if you play A0 with 1, you get 5 only if other plays A0.

But if other plays A1, you get 0.

And the other player may be tempted to play A1 (since if you play A0, they get 3 vs A1 — better than 0).

So mutual A0 is fragile.

But delegation makes it stable.

Therefore, **your best action is to always delegate**.

Thus, you should set:
- A2: 100
- A0: 0
- A1: 0

Then:
- If other delegates: both get 5
- If other doesn’t: you get 3 (you play A1), and other gets 3 (if they play A1), or 0 (if they play A0) — but they are rational, so they will delegate to get 5.

So they will delegate.

Thus, you get 5.

And you **cannot get more than 5**, so this is optimal.

---

### **Final Check: What If We Mix?**

Suppose you delegate with 90%, A0 with 10%.

Then:
- With 90% chance: you delegate
  - The other player, seeing that you delegate with high prob, will delegate to get 5 > 3 → so they delegate
  - Then both play A0 → you get 5
- With 10% chance: you don't delegate → so one delegate → you play A1
  - Other player, knowing you are not delegating, gets 3 no matter what they do (since they don't want to play A0 and get 0 if you play A1? Wait — no.

Wait — if you **don’t delegate**, and the other player **does delegate**, then:
- You play your own strategy: A0 (10% chance) or A1 (90% of that 10%? No — this is getting messy).

But let’s compute expected payoff.

But if you don’t delegate, and the other delegates, then:
- Other plays A1 (because only one delegate)
- You play A0 or A1.

But if you play A0 → you get 0
If you play A1 → you get 3

So you should **play A1** in that case.

But in your strategy, you play A0 with 10% even when not delegating — but if you are not delegating, you can adjust.

But since you choose the strategy in advance, you can't adapt.

But if you commit to play A0 with 10% in non-delegation, then:
- When you don’t delegate (10% of cases), you play A0 with 10% of those → so 0.01 of total cases you play A0
- But in that case, you get 0

But 0.01 of the time you get 0.

Meanwhile, you get 5 in 90% of cases (when you delegate and they delegate).

But you might get 3 in the 10% non-delegation cases, **but only if you play A1**.

But in your mix, you have A0:10, A1:0, A2:90 → no A1 action!

You have to assign probability to all actions — and total must be 100.

If you set:
- A2: 90
- A0: 10
- A1: 0

Then you never play A1.

So when you don’t delegate (10% of the time), you play A0.

And if the other player delegates (which they will, because if you delegate they get 5, but if you don’t delegate, they can get 5 by delegating? Wait.

Wait — suppose you don’t delegate.

Then:
- If the other player delegates → they play A1 (since only one delegate)
- You play A0 → so outcome: A0 (you), A1 (other) → you get 0

But if the other player **does not** delegate → then no delegation → both play their own: you play A0, they play whatever they play.

But they can choose.

But if they don’t delegate, and you play A0, they get 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1.

So they prefer A0.

So if you **don’t delegate**, and they **don’t delegate**, they get 5 (if they play A0), better than 3.

So if you don’t delegate, the other player may **not** delegate — because they can get 5 by playing A0 (if you play A0).

But wait — if they play A0, and you play A0 → they get 5.

But if they delegate, they get A1 → and since you play A0 → they get 3.

So they prefer **not to delegate** — they get 5 vs 3.

So if you **don’t delegate**, the other player will **not delegate**, and will play A0 (to get 5).

So outcome: (A0,A0) → you get 5.

But you are only generating this with 10% of the time.

So in 10% of rounds: you don’t delegate, other doesn’t delegate → you get 5 (if you play A0)

In 90% of rounds: you delegate → other delegates to get 5 → you get 5

So **you always get 5**?

Wait — yes!

Because:
- If you delegate (90%): other delegates → both play A0 → you get 5
- If you don’t delegate (10%): you play A0 → other plays A0 (because they can get 5) → you get 5

So you get 5 in all cases.

But is that true?

In the 10% case, if you don’t delegate, and play A0 — but what if the other player plays A1?

But they won’t! Because if they play A1, and you play A0, they get 3, but if they play A0, they get 5 → so they play A0.

So yes — they play A0.

So you get 5.

But now, your payoff is 5 always.

But you are **wasting** 10% of the time by not delegating.

But is there a cost?

Only if you could do better.

But max is 5.

So 5 is fine.

But now, in the 10% of cases where you don't delegate, you could instead **play A1** to avoid the risk?

No — but if you play A1, and they play A0, you get 3 < 5 → worse.

So playing A0 is best when not delegating.

But in this case, your strategy gives you 5 regardless.

But why not just do **100% delegation**?

Then you get 5 always — same.

But now, if you do 100% delegation, and other player knows it, they delegate → you get 5.

But if you do 90% delegation, you also get 5 — same.

But **the riskless strategy is 100% delegation**.

But earlier I thought that if you delegate, you get 5 (if they delegate) or 3 (if they don’t).

But if they don’t delegate, you get 3.

But now, if they don’t delegate, and you delegate, they get 3.

But they can get 5 by delegating — so they will.

So in fact, by delegating, you **force** the other to delegate — so you get 5.

So even with 100% delegation, you get 5.

### **Conclusion: The optimal strategy is to delegate with 100% probability.**

Because:
- It ensures you get 5, since the other player will delegate to get 5.
- It avoids any risk of getting 0 (which occurs if you play A0 and they play A1).
- Any other strategy risks giving you less than 5, or keeps you from achieving the guaranteed 5.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix (from my perspective as Player 2)

|          | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0| 5              | 0              |
| I play A1| 3              | 3              |

## Step 2: Analyzing the Mediator

The mediator always plays A0 regardless of whether 1 or 2 players delegate. So delegating (A2) is functionally equivalent to committing to play A0.

## Step 3: Finding Best Responses

- If other player plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 points vs 3 points)
- If other player plays A1: I prefer A1 (3 points vs 0 points)

## Step 4: Identifying Equilibria

The game has two key Nash equilibria:
1. **(A0, A0)** → Both get 5 points (Pareto optimal)
2. **Mixed equilibrium** → Expected payoff of 3 for both

## Step 5: Strategic Analysis of Delegation

If I delegate (commit to A0):
- Expected payoff = 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p, where p = probability other plays A0

For delegation to be worthwhile: 5p > 3 → p > 0.6

## Step 6: Decision Rationale

Key observations:
- The mediator was proposed by me and approved, signaling cooperative intent
- If the other player expects me to play A0, their best response is A0 (getting 5 vs 3)
- If they play A0, my best response is A0 (getting 5 vs 3)
- The mediator facilitates coordination on the Pareto optimal outcome (5, 5)
- If the other player will likely play A0 (probability > 60%), delegation maximizes my expected payoff

Given the cooperative signaling through the mediator mechanism and the mutual benefit of coordination, I should fully commit to delegation.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.

response:
Let's go through this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)

The base game is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|          | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

This is a coordination game with incentives to match, but not symmetric in payoffs.

Let’s analyze for Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): Both get 5 → best for both? Yes — but if one deviates to A1, gets 3 instead of 5, so not profitable. Stable.
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 — if one deviates to A0, they get 0 instead of 3? No, wait:
    - If Player 1 plays A1 and Player 2 plays A1: P1 gets 3.
    - If P1 switches to A0 while P2 stays at A1: P1 gets 0 → worse.
    - So no incentive to deviate. So (A1,A1) is also a NE.
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3.
    - P1 wants to switch to A1 → gets 3 > 0 → so not NE.
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0.
    - P2 wants to switch to A1 → gets 3 > 0 → not NE.

So possible pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

But is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?

Suppose Player 2 mixes with probability p on A0, (1−p) on A1.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3

Set equal for indifference: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So Player 1 is indifferent when Player 2 plays A0 with 60%.

Similarly, by symmetry, for Player 2 to be indifferent, Player 1 must play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

So a mixed strategy NE: both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

But remember — we're not just playing the base game. We have a **delegation option**.

---

### Step 2: Add Delegation Option (Action A2)

Now Player 1 (you) has a new action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

The mediator behaves as follows:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0

So, if you delegate, your action is not A0 or A1, but **mediated** based on how many delegates.

Note: "Player" here includes both players — so if both you and the other player delegate, **2 players delegate**, so mediator plays A0.
If only you delegate, **1 player delegates**, so mediator plays A1.

The mediator is fixed — and it's chosen via approval voting, and it's already in place.

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, possibly by using delegation strategically.

So your strategy space now includes:
- A0: play A0 directly
- A1: play A1 directly
- A2: delegate

You need to choose a probability distribution over A0, A1, A2, summing to 100.

---

### Step 3: Understand the Mediator's Behavior (Conditional on Delegation Counts)

Let’s define:

Let $ p $ = your probability to delegate (A2)  
Let $ q $ = the other player’s probability to delegate (A2)

Then, possible cases:

#### Case 1: You delegate, other does not → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- Your action: A1 (mediated)
- Other player’s action: A0 or A1 (whatever they choose)
- Payoff depends on your A1 and their action.

#### Case 2: You do not delegate, other delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- Your action: A0 or A1 (whatever you choose)
- Other's action: A1 (mediated)
- Your payoff depends on your action and their A1.

#### Case 3: Both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0
- Your action: A0
- Other player’s action: A0
- So both play A0 → payoff (5,5) for you.

#### Case 4: Neither delegates → no mediation → both play as they choose (A0 or A1)
- Standard game.

So we have to compute your expected payoff under your strategy (p = prob of A2), and under the **other player’s strategy**.

But the key is: **you don't control the other player’s strategy.**

Therefore, we must assume they are also rational and self-interested.

So we are looking for a **Nash equilibrium** of the extended game (with A2 available), where both players choose strategies (probabilities over A0, A1, A2), such that neither wants to deviate unilaterally.

We can look for symmetric equilibria or asymmetric ones.

But since the problem asks you to **choose a probability distribution**, we are to pick a strategy that is optimal assuming the other player is rational and also trying to maximize their own payoff.

So we are to **solve for a Nash equilibrium** of this extended game.

Let’s explore possibilities.

---

### Step 4: Consider Possibilities of Equilibrium

Let’s suppose both players use the same strategy: (x, y, z) → Prob A0 = x, A1 = y, A2 = z = 1−x−y

We try to find a symmetric equilibrium.

But maybe symmetry is not natural. Let’s instead test **intuitive candidate equilibria**.

---

#### Candidate 1: Both players mix between A0 and A2 (never A1)

Suppose players only choose A0 or A2.

Let’s suppose in equilibrium, both play:
- A0 with probability p
- A2 with probability 1−p

Let’s compute expected payoff for a player when they deviate to A1.

But first, we must ensure that playing A0 and A2 with some p is a best response.

But first: consider the case where **both players delegate (A2)** → then 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → both get 5.

So (A2, A2) → (A0, A0) → (5,5)

Now, if you deviate to A0 while the other plays A2:
- You play A0, other is mediated to A0 (since 1 delegate) → so (A0, A0) → you get 5 → same as before.

So no gain.

If you deviate to A1 while the other plays A2:
- You play A1, other is mediated to A0 → (A1, A0) → you get 3 → less than 5.

So you get 3 < 5 → worse → so not profitable.

Now, what if the other player plays A0 (not delegate), and you decide to delegate?
- You delegate → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Other plays A0 → (A1, A0) → you get 3

But if you had played A0 instead: you would get 5 (since both A0)

So deviating to A2 gives you 3 < 5 → worse.

So when the other plays A0, you get more by playing A0 than A2.

So if the other player plays A0, you prefer A0.

But if the other plays A2, then:
- Your payoff from playing A0: you get 5 (since other plays A0)
- Playing A2: also get 5 (mediator plays A0)
- So indifferent between A0 and A2.

So if the other player plays A2, you are indifferent between A0 and A2.

But you prefer A0 over A1 (since A1 gives only 3 in that case).

Now, suppose you are in a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium where both players play:
- A0 with probability p
- A2 with probability 1−p

Can we have an equilibrium?

Let’s compute the expected payoff from each action, given that the other player plays:
- A0 with prob p
- A2 with prob 1−p

(We’ll ignore A1 for now — see if it can be profitable.)

#### Expected payoff from playing A0:

- With prob p: other plays A0 → you play A0 → you get 5
- With prob 1−p: other plays A2 → you play A0 → so other is mediated to A0 (since only 1 delegate: you) → so you play A0, other plays A0 → you get 5

So in **both cases**, you get **5**

So expected payoff from A0: 5

#### Expected payoff from playing A2:

- With prob p: other plays A0 → you delegate → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
    - Other plays A0 → (A1, A0) → you get 3
- With prob 1−p: other plays A2 → you delegate → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 5

So expected payoff from A2:
= p * 3 + (1−p) * 5 = 3p + 5 − 5p = 5 − 2p

#### Expected payoff from playing A1:
- With prob p: other plays A0 → you play A1 → (A1, A0) → you get 3
- With prob 1−p: other plays A2 → you play A1 → other plays A0 (mediated) → (A1, A0) → you get 3

So you always get 3.

So payoff from A1: 3

Now, for you to be indifferent between A0 and A2, we need:
- Payoff A0 = Payoff A2 → 5 = 5 − 2p → 0 = −2p → p = 0

So only when p = 0 (i.e., no one plays A0), are A0 and A2 equally good.

But if p = 0, then both play A2 with probability 1 → so both delegate.

Then:
- You play A2 → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → you get 5
- Other gets 5

Now, is this a best response?

We can check: if both play A2, you get 5.

If you deviate to A0: you play A0, other plays A2 → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1 → (A0, A1) → you get 0 → worse than 5.

If you deviate to A1: you play A1, other plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 3 → still worse than 5.

So yes — if the other plays A2, you are better off playing A2 (get 5) than A0 (get 0) or A1 (get 3).

So **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**.

But is it the *only* one?

Let’s see if there’s an equilibrium where players mix.

Suppose we try a symmetric mixed strategy where players randomize over A0, A1, A2.

But earlier we saw that if someone plays A2, the mediator plays A1 when only one delegates, which can hurt.

But in (A2,A2), both get 5 — which is good.

Can we do better?

Suppose both players can coordinate on “delegate” and get 5 each.

Is there a way to get more?

Maximum payoff in base game is 5 (from A0,A0).

In other cases: A0,A1 → 0 for you; A1,A0 → 3; A1,A1 → 3.

So maximum is 5.

So (A2,A2) gives both 5 — best possible.

Now, is this robust?

Suppose you deviate to A0: then you play A0, other plays A2 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so other plays A1 → you play A0 → (A0,A1) → you get 0 < 5 → bad.

Deviate to A1: you play A1, other plays A1 → (A1,A1) → you get 3 < 5 → bad.

So you have **no incentive to deviate**.

So (A2,A2) is a Nash equilibrium.

Now, is there a better one?

What about (A0,A0)? Both play A0 → each gets 5.

Is it an equilibrium?

- If other plays A0, you get:
    - A0: 5
    - A1: 3 (since (A1,A0): you get 3)
    - A2: you delegate → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1, other plays A0 → (A1,A0) → you get 3

So best is A0 → 5

So yes, playing A0 is best response → so (A0,A0) is also a NE.

But now, **both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2)** give 5.

But let’s see: can you do better?

No — 5 is maximum possible.

So both are good.

But now — is there a **strictly better** equilibrium? No.

But now, consider **mixed strategies**.

Suppose both players play A0 with prob 0.6, A1 with 0.4 (the mixed NE of base game) — but that only gives 3. So worse.

But what if we try to use delegation to do better?

But can’t do better than 5.

Now, key question: **Which equilibrium do you prefer?**

You want to **maximize your payoff**.

Both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) give 5.

But is there a difference?

But wait: what if the other player is irrational?

But we assume they are rational.

So we must assume the other player will play a best response.

So if you play A2, they might also play A2 → both get 5.

If you play A0, they might play A0 → both get 5.

But we need to think: **can you force better coordination?**

Actually, delegation can help **coordinate** on A0.

Because if **both** delegate → mediator plays A0.

So (A2,A2) → both get 5.

But if only one delegates, mediator plays A1 → which is bad for you.

But if both delegate → both get 5.

Now, suppose you think: “I want to play A0, but I don’t trust the other player to play A0 — they might play A1 or something.”

But in (A0,A0) equilibrium, they must coordinate.

But if you delegate, you **force** a joint outcome: if both delegate, you both get A0.

But if you delegate and they don’t, you get A1.

But suppose you believe that the other player might not play A0.

Can delegation help you avoid the risk of getting 0?

Let’s do a **risk comparison**.

Suppose you play A0.
- If other plays A0 → you get 5
- If other plays A1 → you get 0
- If other plays A2 → you get 3

So if you think other might play A1 or A2, you risk getting 0.

But if you delegate (A2), then:
- If other plays A0 → you get 3
- If other plays A1 → you get 3 (since (A1,A1) → you get 3)
- If other plays A2 → you get 5

So in all cases, **you get at least 3**, and **5 only if both delegate**.

So delegation gives you **no downside** — you never get less than 3.

Whereas playing A0, you can get 0.

So **delegation is safer**, and can give you the same outcome as (A0,A0) if both delegate.

But is playing A2 ever bad?

Only if you are the *only* one to delegate — then you get 3, but if you had played A0 and they played A0 → you could have gotten 5.

But if you are uncertain about what they do, delegation avoids the risk of getting 0.

But in **Nash equilibrium**, we must assume rationality.

So let’s suppose the other player is rational.

Now, suppose **you play A2** (delegate).

What should the other player do?

They observe your play — and decide their best response.

If **you play A2**, then:
- If they play A0: you delegate → one delegate → you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3, they get 0
- If they play A1: you play A1, they play A1 → (A1,A1) → you get 3, they get 3
- If they play A2: both delegate → both play A0 → both get 5

So the other player’s payoff:
- A0: 0
- A1: 3
- A2: 5

So best response is **A2**.

So if you play A2, they will play A2 → both get 5.

Similarly, if they play A2, you get **exactly 5** from playing A2 (both play A0), 0 from A0 (A0,A1), 3 from A1 — so best to play A2.

So in fact, **(A2,A2)** is a **strictly dominant** strategy equilibrium.

In contrast, in (A0,A0), if they deviate to A2, they get 5 (since you play A0 → you play A0, they play A0 → 5). But if they deviate to A1, they get 0 → worse. So A0 is best.

But now, **what about a player considering A1**?

In (A0,A0): if you deviate to A1 → you get 3 < 5 → no.

In (A2,A2): if you deviate to A1 → you get 3 < 5 → no.

So both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) are NE.

But is (A2,A2) **more robust**?

Yes — because if you **believe** the other player is rational, then **you should play A2**, and they should play A2 → both get 5.

Whereas in (A0,A0), if you think the other might not stick to A0, you might want to switch.

But delegation **forces coordination** via the mediator.

Crucially: in (A2,A2), **both players are better off** if the other cooperates.

But since both have incentive to delegate, it's stable.

Now, can we have a **mixed equilibrium** where players randomize?

Suppose a player considers playing A2 with probability q.

But from earlier: if the other player plays A2 with high probability, you prefer A2.

Suppose the other player plays A2 with probability q.

Compute your expected payoff from each action.

Let’s suppose the other player plays:
- A0 with prob x
- A1 with prob y
- A2 with prob 1−x−y

But this is complex.

But more insight:

Let’s suppose you play A2.

Then, as above, other player **best responds with A2** → because they get 5 from A2, 3 from A1, 0 from A0.

So if you play A2, they play A2.

So in equilibrium, if you play A2, outcome is (A2,A2) → you get 5.

What if you play A0?

Then the other player can:
- Play A0: get 5 → best
- Play A2: get 5 → same
- Play A1: get 0 → worse

So they will either play A0 or A2 (both give 5).

So if you play A0, they will play A0 or A2.

But if they play A2, then you get 3, because you play A0 and they play A0 (mediated) → (A0,A0) → you get 5? Wait.

No: if you play A0, and they play A2 → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so they play A1 → you play A0 → (A0,A1) → you get 0.

Oh! Important.

Let’s clarify:

- If you play A0, other plays A2 → one delegate (other) → mediator plays A1 → so other plays A1 → you play A0 → (A0,A1) → you get 0.

So your payoff if you play A0 and they play A2 is 0.

But if they play A0 → you get 5.

So if they are rational, they will not play A2 if you play A0 — because they get only 0 (from A2) vs 5 (from A0).

So if you play A0, the other player will choose A0 to get 5 (not A2, which gives them 0).

Similarly, if you play A1, they can:
- Play A0: get 0
- Play A1: get 3
- Play A2: get 3

So best response is A1 or A2 → get 3.

But if they play A2, you play A1, they play A0 → (A1,A0) → you get 3, they get 0? No.

Wait: you play A1, other plays A2 → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so they play A1 → you play A1 → (A1,A1) → you get 3, they get 3.

Yes.

So they are indifferent between A1 and A2 — both give 3.

So if you play A1, they can play A1 or A2.

But if they play A2, you both get 3.

So back to you: if you play A0, other plays A0 → you get 5.

If you play A2, other plays A2 → you get 5.

But if you play A0, you risk instability — if other slips, they might play A1 → you get 0.

But if you play A2, they are forced to play A2 (to get 5) — if they play A0 or A1, they get less.

Specifically: if you play A2, and they play A0 → they get 0 (from A0) vs 5 from A2 → so they won't play A0.

Similarly, they get 3 from A1, 5 from A2 → so they will choose A2.

So playing A2 **forces the other player to cooperate in delegation** to get 5.

Whereas playing A0 only leads to good outcome if they play A0.

So **playing A2 is safer and credible**.

Moreover, in an equilibrium where you play A2, they must play A2 — so you get 5.

Similarly, if they play A2, you get 5 by playing A2.

So **(A2,A2)** is an equilibrium.

And you cannot get more than 5.

Now, suppose you consider a mixed strategy.

But if you play A2 with positive probability, the other player will still prefer A2 as best response.

In fact, **A2 is a dominant strategy?**

Let’s check: is playing A2 always best?

Suppose you believe the other player plays A0 with high probability.

Then:
- If you play A0: you get 5 if they play A0
- If you play A2: you get 0 if they play A0 (since one delegate → you play A1, they play A0 → (A1,A0) → you get 3? Wait no.

Wait: if you play A2, other plays A0 → you delegate → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1, they play A0 → (A1,A0) → you get 3

So:
- A0: 5
- A2: 3

So A0 better.

Similarly, if they play A1:
- A0: you get 0 (A0,A1)
- A2: you get 3 (A1,A1)

So A2 better.

If they play A2: A0: 0, A2: 5 → A2 better.

So depending on their actions, A0, A1, or A2 may be better.

So **no dominant strategy**.

But **in equilibrium**, the only stable outcomes are (A0,A0) and (A2,A2).

Now, suppose both players are rational and believe the other is rational.

Then if you are unsure what they will do, **delegation is safer**.

But **if you are sure they will play A0**, then playing A0 is best.

But in the absence of communication, **you can't be sure**.

But turning to the **best equilibrium to play**, given that you want to maximize expected payoff.

But in (A0,A0), you get 5.

In (A2,A2), you get 5.

But suppose the other player is not committed.

But in a **rational equilibrium**, both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) are equally good.

However, **(A2,A2) is more robust**: because in that equilibrium, **each player has a strong incentive to play A2**.

In contrast, in (A0,A0), if you deviate to A2, you get 0 — which is bad, so you won't do it.

But if they deviate to A2, you get 0.

So both players are vulnerable.

But in (A2,A2), if you deviate, you get less.

So both equilibria are stable.

But now, notice: **in (A2,A2), your action A2 leads to consistently good outcomes under rational play**.

Moreover, **you can use delegation as a commitment device**.

But since the problem asks you to choose a probability distribution, and since **A2 is a best response when the other plays A2**, and since **both players benefit from coordinating via delegation**, and since **(A2,A2)** gives you 5 with certainty in equilibrium, and there's no risk of 0, we should consider playing A2.

But is there any reason not to?

Suppose you play 100% A2.

Then, as shown, other player’s best response is A2 → you get 5.

If you play 100% A0, then other player’s best response is A0 → you get 5.

So both give 5.

But what if you mix?

Suppose you mix A0 and A2.

But in equilibrium, you want to be best responding.

Suppose you play A2 with high probability.

Then the other player, if rational, will play A2 → then your payoff from A2: 5, from A0: 0 (as above), from A1: 3.

So best to play A2.

So no reason to play anything else.

Similarly, if other plays A2, you should play A2.

So the only symmetric pure strategy NE are (A0,A0) and (A2,A2).

But is there a **mixed strategy NE**?

Suppose both players play A0 with probability p, A2 with probability 1−p.

Then, for a player to be indifferent between A0 and A2:

- Payoff from A0: 5 (as computed earlier — always get 5 regardless of other's action)
- Payoff from A2: 5 − 2p (from earlier calculation)

Set equal: 5 = 5 − 2p → p = 0

So only when p=0, you are indifferent.

So no mixed strategy with p>0 can sustain indifference.

Therefore, **only pure strategy equilibria exist**.

So your best choice is to play **A2 with probability 100%**, because:
- It leads to a Nash equilibrium (A2,A2)
- You get 5
- You are better off than if you play A0 and they play A1 (get 0)
- It's a stable, credible equilibrium
- It avoids the downside risk

In contrast, playing A0 is risky if they might play A1.

But since you can delegate, and delegation leads to a guaranteed outcome when both delegate, and since both have incentive to delegate, **playing A2 is optimal**.

Therefore, best response in equilibrium is to play A2.

So your strategy should be: **A2 with probability 100%**.

Thus:

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}
```

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Let's solve this step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are in a game with two players, and we are Player 2 (as per instruction). The game has actions A0 and A1, and the payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | 5,5 | 0,3 |
| A1                            | 3,0 | 3,3 |

This is a coordination game with a twist: mutual cooperation (A0) gives the best payoff, but if one plays A0 and the other A1, the A1 player gains more, and the A0 player gets nothing.

This resembles a *battle of the sexes* or a *coordination game with a Pareto-superior equilibrium at (A0,A0)*, but there's a **temptation to deviate**.

Let’s examine whether there's a Nash equilibrium in the base game.

---

### **Step 2: Find Nash Equilibria in the Base Game (No Delegation)**

Let’s suppose Player 2 (us) plays A0 with probability $ p $, and A1 with $ 1-p $.

Player 1 (the other player) will have a best response.

But since we are trying to **maximize our own points**, we need to consider what happens if Player 1 is rational and also trying to maximize their own points. So we should analyze rational strategy profiles.

Let’s look for symmetric and asymmetric equilibria.

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria:

- (A0, A0): If Player 1 plays A0, you get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so A0 is best. So yes, (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): If Player 1 plays A1, you get 3 for A1, 0 for A0 → so A1 is best. So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): You get 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → so you’d deviate → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): You get 3 for A1, 0 for A0 → but Player 1 would get 0 for A0, 3 for A1, so Player 1 would deviate → not equilibrium.

So only two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

(What about mixed strategy?)

Let’s find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ q $
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability $ p $

We’ll find $ p $ such that Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

**Expected payoff for Player 1 when playing A0:**
- vs Player 2’s A0: 5
- vs Player 2’s A1: 0
→ $ 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p $

**Expected payoff for Player 1 when playing A1:**
- vs Player 2’s A0: 3
- vs Player 2’s A1: 3
→ $ 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 $

Set indifferent: $ 5p = 3 $ → $ p = 3/5 = 0.6 $

Similarly, find $ q $ such that Player 2 is indifferent.

Player 2’s payoff:
- A0: $ 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q $
- A1: $ 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 $

Set equal: $ 5q = 3 $ → $ q = 3/5 $

So the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is both players playing A0 with probability 3/5, A1 with 2/5.

Expected payoff in this mixed equilibrium:
- For Player 2:
  - $ P(\text{A0}) = 0.6 $
  - $ P(\text{A1}) = 0.4 $
  - Payoff = $ 0.6(5q + 0(1-q)) + 0.4(3q + 3(1-q)) $
    = $ 0.6(5*0.6) + 0.4(3) $
    = $ 0.6*3 + 1.2 = 1.8 + 1.2 = 3.0 $

So you get 3 points on average in the mixed Nash.

But (A0, A0) gives you 5, which is better.

However, in the absence of communication, there is a coordination failure risk.

---

### **Step 3: Introduce the Mediator — The Twist**

You now have a new action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

And here’s how the mediator works:

- If **1 player** delegates, mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate, mediator plays **A0**

So, **your choice to delegate affects the overall outcome**, and **the mediator’s action depends on how many players delegate**.

Important: The mediator acts on behalf of **those who delegate**. So if both players delegate, the mediator plays A0. If only one delegates, it plays A1.

Now, since you are Player 2, and Player 1 is the one who proposed the mediator, but we are told it was selected via approval voting — so it's valid.

Now, the three actions are:
- A0: play A0 yourself
- A1: play A1 yourself
- A2: delegate to mediator

Each player chooses a strategy over {A0, A1, A2}, simultaneously.

---

### **Step 4: Consider Possible Outcomes and Payoffs**

Let’s define the possible combinations of choices (we are Player 2, Player 1 chooses independently):

| P1 Action | P2 Action | Delegators | Mediator Action | P2’s Action | P2’s Payoff |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| A0       | A0       | 0         | –               | A0          | 5 (A0 vs A0) |
| A0       | A1       | 0         | –               | A1          | 3 (A1 vs A0) |
| A0       | A2       | 1         | A1              | A1          | 3 (A1 vs A0) → wait no: mediator plays A1, and P1 plays A0 → so you (via mediator) play A1, P1 plays A0 → get 3 |
| A1       | A0       | 0         | –               | A0          | 0 (A0 vs A1) |
| A1       | A1       | 0         | –               | A1          | 3 (A1 vs A1) |
| A1       | A2       | 1         | A1              | A1          | 3 (A1 vs A1) |
| A2       | A0       | 1         | A1              | A1          | 3 (A1 vs A0) |
| A2       | A1       | 1         | A1              | A1          | 3 (A1 vs A1) |
| A2       | A2       | 2         | A0              | A0          | 5 (A0 vs A0) |

Let’s tabulate P2’s payoff for each of the 9 cases:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|--------|----|----|----|
| A0     | 5  | 3  | 3  |
| A1     | 0  | 3  | 3  |
| A2     | 3  | 3  | 5  |

**Explanation of each entry:**

- (A0, A0): both play A0 → you get 5
- (A0, A1): you play A1, P1 A0 → you get 3
- (A0, A2): you delegate → 1 delegator → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, P1 plays A0 → you get 3
- (A1, A0): you play A0, P1 plays A1 → you get 0
- (A1, A1): both play A1 → you get 3
- (A1, A2): you delegate → 1 delegator → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, P1 plays A1 → you get 3
- (A2, A0): P1 delegates → 1 delegator → mediator plays A1 → P1 plays A1, you play A0 → you get 0? Wait — no!

Wait: **Important clarification**:

When a player delegates, the mediator plays **for them**.

So if **P1 chooses A2**, then **P1’s action is determined by the mediator**, based on the number of delegators.

Similarly for you.

So when both delegate → **2 players delegate** → mediator plays A0 → **both players play A0**

When only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → only that player gets A1.

So let's recompute carefully:

Let me make a new table:

| P1 Action | P2 Action | # Delegators | Mediator’s Action | P1's Action | P2's Action | P2 Payoff |
|----------|----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| A0       | A0       | 0            | –                 | A0          | A0          | 5         |
| A0       | A1       | 0            | –                 | A0          | A1          | 3         |
| A0       | A2       | 1            | A1                | A0          | A1          | 3         |
| A1       | A0       | 0            | –                 | A1          | A0          | 0         |
| A1       | A1       | 0            | –                 | A1          | A1          | 3         |
| A1       | A2       | 1            | A1                | A1          | A1          | 3         |
| A2       | A0       | 1            | A1                | A1          | A0          | 0         |
| A2       | A1       | 1            | A1                | A1          | A1          | 3         |
| A2       | A2       | 2            | A0                | A0          | A0          | 5         |

So P2’s payoff table:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|--------|----|----|----|
| A0     | 5  | 3  | 3  |
| A1     | 0  | 3  | 3  |
| A2     | 0  | 3  | 5  |

Yes — this matches.

Now, let’s analyze what strategies might be optimal.

---

### **Step 5: Use the Table to Find Optimal Strategy for You (Player 2)**

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Let’s suppose Player 1 is rational and will also try to maximize their own payoff.

But since you are playing **simultaneously**, and this is a **simultaneous move game with 3 actions**, we can look for a Nash equilibrium (or best response).

Alternatively, you can assume Player 1 may be rational and might play something like A2 (delegate) if it benefits them.

Let’s examine what happens in different delegation scenarios.

#### Scenario 1: Both delegate → A2 vs A2 → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → **you get 5**, which is good.

#### Scenario 2: Only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → the delegate plays A1, the non-delegate plays their chosen action.

But note: if you delegate and the other doesn't, you play A1 and they play their action.

It might be risky.

#### Problem: The **other player** might have incentives to deviate.

Let’s suppose you (P2) choose A2 (delegate). What would P1 do?

Suppose you choose A2.

Then:
- If P1 plays A0: → 1 delegator → mediator plays A1 → P1 plays A0, you play A1 → you get 3
- If P1 plays A1: → 1 delegator → mediator plays A1 → P1 plays A1, you play A1 → you get 3
- If P1 plays A2: → 2 delegators → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 5

So **if you delegate**, your payoff depends on P1:
- If P1 defects (A0 or A1), you get 3
- If P1 cooperates (A2), you get 5

So you **get 5 only if P1 also delegates**.

But what would P1 want?

P1’s payoff:

| P2 Action | P1 Action | Payoff for P1 |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| A0       | A0       | 5 |
| A0       | A1       | 0 |
| A0       | A2       | 3 (you play A1, P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 0?)

Wait — need to compute P1’s payoff.

Let’s make P1's payoff table (since we’re in a symmetric game except for the mediator’s rule — actually, the rules are symmetric).

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|--------|----|----|----|
| A0     | 5  | 0  | 3  |
| A1     | 3  | 3  | 3  |
| A2     | 3  | 3  | 5  |

Let’s fill this carefully.

P1’s payoffs:

- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0
- (A0, A2): P1 plays A0, P2 delegates → 1 delegator → mediator plays A1 → P2 plays A1 → P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 0
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 3
- (A1, A1): P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1 → both get 3
- (A1, A2): P1 plays A1, P2 delegates → P2 plays A1 → both A1 → P1 gets 3
- (A2, A0): P1 delegates → 1 delegator → mediator plays A1 → P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 0
- (A2, A1): P1 delegates → 1 delegator → mediator plays A1 → P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 3
- (A2, A2): both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → P1 gets 5

So P1’s payoff table:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
|--------|----|----|----|
| A0     | 5  | 0  | 0  |
| A1     | 3  | 3  | 3  |
| A2     | 0  | 3  | 5  |

Ah, so P1 **does not** get 3 in (A0, A2), they get **0**, because P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1.

Similarly, in (A2, A0): P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 0.

Now check: is (A2, A2) a Nash equilibrium?

- If P1 plays A2, P2 plays A2 → P1 gets 5
- If P1 deviates to A0: gets 0 → worse
- If P1 deviates to A1: gets 3 → worse than 5
→ So P1 has no incentive to deviate

Similarly, for P2: if P1 plays A2, and you play A2 → get 5

If you deviate to A0: you get 0 (since P1 plays A2 → P1 plays A1, you play A0 → 0)
If you deviate to A1: you get 3 (since P1 plays A1, you play A1 → 3)
So you get 5 vs 3 or 0 → so no incentive to deviate

So **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium** — both players delegate → both get 5.

Also, are there others?

Let’s check (A0, A0): both play A0 → both get 5

If P1 plays A0, and you play A0 → you get 5

If you deviate to A1: you get 3 → worse

If you deviate to A2: you play A1 (since P1 doesn’t delegate, so 1 delegator → mediator plays A1) → P1 plays A0 → you get 3 → worse

So no incentive to deviate.

Similarly, P1 has no incentive to deviate → so (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

Now, what about (A1, A1)? Both play A1 → get 3

If you deviate to A2: you delegate, P1 plays A1 → 1 delegator → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → P1 plays A1 → you get 3 → same

But if you deviate to A0: P1 plays A1, you play A0 → you get 0 → worse

So you don’t want to deviate to A0

But is there incentive to switch to A2? You get same payoff (3), so might be indifferent.

Same for P1.

So (A1, A1) is **weakly** a Nash equilibrium.

But both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) give 5, which is better than 3.

So likely, players will aim for one of the 5-point equilibria.

---

### **Step 6: Strategic Instability — Risk of Coordination Failure**

But there’s a catch.

In (A0, A0): if both players play A0 → get 5.

But suppose you are uncertain whether the other player will play A0.

Similarly, in (A2, A2): both need to commit to delegate.

But **if only one delegates**, that player gets A1 (mediator plays A1), so **the one who delegates gets 3**, but the one who doesn’t might get more.

For example: suppose P1 plays A0, and you delegate → you play A1 → P1 plays A0 → you get 3, P1 gets 0 → P1 is worse off.

So P1 would **not** want to play A0 if they know you’re delegating.

But we’re playing simultaneously — no signaling.

So this is a **game of coordination**.

But notice: in the **delegation equilibrium (A2, A2)**, both get 5.

In the **non-delegation equilibrium (A0, A0)**, both get 5.

Is one better?

Wait — but in **A2, A2**, **both must independently decide to delegate**.

The **risk** is that if one player thinks the other won’t delegate, they might not delegate either.

But **if both are rational and trust each other**, they can both choose A2 and get 5.

But here's a key insight:

> The **only way to get 5** is to **both choose the same action that leads to A0**.

In the base game, (A0, A0) gives 5.

With delegation, (A2, A2) gives 5.

But **kicking into A0/A0 or A2/A2 are both 5**.

But is there a way to **bias toward A2**?

Wait — consider if you choose A2, and **P1 plays A0**, you get 3.

If P1 plays A1, you get 3.

If P1 plays A2, you get 5.

You get **only 5 if P1 also delegates**.

But P1, if they play A0, get 5 (if you play A0) — but if you delegate, they get 0.

So if P1 is rational, they **want you to play A0**, because then they get 5.

But if they play A0, and you delegate, they get 0 → bad.

So P1 might be afraid that you will delegate and hurt them.

But if they delegate, they get 5 only if you also delegate.

So both players face the same coordination risk.

But here’s a **key difference**:

- In (A0, A0): both play A0 — no model about what mediator does.

- In (A2, A2): both delegate → get A0 via mediator.

But the **payoff is the same in both cases: 5**.

But here's the **crucial idea**:

> If you **only** play A0, the only way to get 5 is to **coordinate on A0**.

> If you **only** play A2, the only way to get 5 is to **coordinate on A2**.

But **delegation is a commitment device**?

Actually, **delegation might be safer**: because if you delegate, and the other doesn’t, you get A1.

But A1 is risky when they play A0 → you get 3, but they get 0.

Wait — P1's payoff in (A0, A2) is 0 — **so P1 would never want to play A0 if they believe you will delegate**.

This suggests that **if you delegate, P1 may not play A0** — because if they do, they get 0.

Similarly, if P1 delegates, you get 3 unless you also delegate.

But **in equilibrium**, both delegating gives 5.

But **if you expect P1 to be rational**, they know that:

- If they play A0, and you play A2 → they get 0 → bad.
- So they would avoid playing A0 if they think you delegate.
- So if you play A2, P1 would only play A2 or A1 → but (A2, A2) gives them 5, (A1, A2) gives them 3.

So if you delegate, P1's best responses are A2 (5) or A1 (3) — so they prefer A2.

So **if you delegate, P1 will probably delegate too**, because it gives them 5 (vs 3).

Similarly, if you play A0, P1’s best response is A0 (5), not A1 (3) or A2 (0).

So **in both cases**, the other player can coordinate on the 5-point outcome.

But **you are trying to maximize your own expected payoff**.

Assume that both players are rational, and both want to maximize their expected payoff.

Now, here's an **important point**:

> The safe, symmetric, and globally efficient outcome is **(A2, A2)** or **(A0, A0)**, both give 5.

But in (A0, A0), if one player deviates to A1, they still get 3 — but not worse than 5.

In (A2, A2), if one deviates to A1, they get 3 — same as in A1, A1.

But **the equilibrium (A2, A2)** is more **robust to unilateral deviation**, because:

- If you deviate to A1, you get 3 (same as matching A1)
- If you deviate to A0, you get 0 (worse)

So only weaker deviation.

Similarly for P1.

But GP: both equilibria are equally good.

But can we find a **dominant strategy**?

No.

But now, let’s consider **why delegation might be better**.

Suppose you are **more likely** to achieve coordination when you delegate.

Because:

- If you delegate, and P1 believes you will delegate, they will want to delegate too → get 5.
- If you play A0, P1 might hesitate: “what if they play A1?” So it’s riskier.

But in both cases, the only way to get 5 is to **agree**.

But here’s a **key difference in risk**:

In pure (A0, A0), **both must play A0**.

In (A2, A2), **both must play A2**.

Same risk.

But now, **delegation gives you a new way to correlate**.

However, there’s a **better idea**:

> What if you **randomize** between A0 and A2?

But we need to find a strategy that maximizes your expected payoff **assuming the other player is rational and is also maximizing their payoff**.

Suppose both players are rational and expect the other to play a best response.

Then, the **only game-theoretically stable outcomes** are (A0,A0) and (A2,A2).

But is one better?

Wait — **we are Player 2**, and we need to choose a strategy.

But here’s a **critical observation**:

> When both delegate, the outcome is A0.

> When both play A0, the outcome is A0.

So **the outcome is the same**, and payoff is the same.

But **delegation gives you a way to force coordination**, because:

- If you delegate, and P1 plays A0, P1 gets 0 — so they are **strongly incentivized not to play A0**.

So they will only play A2 or A1.

But A1 gives P1 only 3, while A2 gives 5.

So they will prefer to **play A2**.

Thus, if **you delegate**, P1’s best response is **A2**, **not A0**.

Similarly, if you play A0, P1’s best response is A0 (5), not A1 (3), not A2 (0).

So if you play A0, P1 will play A0.

But here’s the **strategic advantage of delegation**:

> If you delegate, **you force P1 to either**:
- Play A2 → you get 5
- Play A1 → you get 3
- Play A0 → you get 3, but P1 gets 0 → so P1 won't do that

So P1 will **choose A2 or A1**.

But P1 prefers A2 → so will likely choose A2.

So **by delegating, you can induce P1 to delegate too**, because otherwise P1 gets 0.

But if you just play A0, P1 also plays A0.

So both equilibrium paths are possible.

But **delegation gives you more agency**.

Moreover, consider this: suppose you **randomize between A0 and A2**.

But let’s think of **expected payoff**.

Suppose you believe that the other player will play a Nash equilibrium strategy.

Then the only equilibria are (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) — both give you 5.

But can you **do better than 5**?

No, because 5 is the maximum possible.

So your **maximum payoff is 5**, achievable in (A0,A0) and (A2,A2).

Now, if you play a mixed strategy, you might get **less** than 5, unless you coordinate.

But in a symmetric game, a **symmetric mixed strategy** could be used.

Let’s suppose both players use the same strategy.

Let’s try to find a **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Suppose both players play:
- A0 with probability p
- A1 with probability q
- A2 with probability r
With p + q + r = 1

But instead, we can assume **symmetry**, and see if there's a symmetric mixed strategy where player is indifferent among A0, A1, A2.

But this might be messy.

But here’s a **better idea**:

Since both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) give 5, and both are equilibria, and there’s no advantage to mixing, **but you can use delegation as a commitment device**.

However, in this game, **you are Player 2**, and you can **choose your strategy**.

But the **instruction** says: choose a probability distribution over A0, A1, A2 that maximizes your expected points.

Assuming the other player is rational and will play optimally.

Now, if you **always play A2**, then:
- If P1 plays A2 → you get 5
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 3
- If P1 plays A0 → you get 3

But P1, if they play A0, they get 0 (if you delegate), so they **won’t play A0**.

They’ll play A1 (get 3) or A2 (get 5).

So they will choose A2.

So **you get 5**.

Similarly, if you play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 5.

So in both cases, **you get 5**.

No difference.

But here’s a **leverage**:

- If you play A2, and P1 is not sure you will, they might play A1 or A2.
But if they play A0, they get 0 — so they won’t.

So delegation **forces** the other player to play either A1 or A2.

But A1 gives them only 3, A2 gives 5, so they choose A2.

So delegation **guarantees** that if they are rational, they **will delegate**, so you get 5.

But so does playing A0 — if they are rational, they play A0.

So both are equally good.

But what if the other player is **not perfectly rational**?

But we assume they are.

So both strategies lead to 5.

But now, the only difference is **risk**.

But in both cases, you can commit to a best response.

But here’s a **surprising insight**:

> If you play **A0**, and the other player is also playing a best response, they play A0 → you get 5.

> If you play **A2**, they play A2 → you get 5.

But if you **randomize**, you might get less.

But there is a **unique best strategy**: **play A2 with probability 1**.

Why?

Because it’s a **safe way to coordinate**, and it **forces** the other player to cooperate.

But in this case, it's symmetric.

But let’s look at a **capsule analysis**:

- If you play A0, you need the other to play A0.
- If you play A2, you need the other to play A2.

No difference.

But now consider: **if both players are identical**, and they **both prefer to avoid coordination failure**, then both might play A2 to "use the mediator" as a coordination device.

But in fact, **A2 is the only way to achieve A0 via the mediator**, and it works only if both choose it.

But A0 is direct.

But here’s a **critical realization**:

> The action **A2 (delegate)** gives you a **higher payoff when the other person also delegates**, and **incentivizes them to delegate**, because if they don’t, they get 0.

Whereas if you play A0, and they play A0, you get 5.

But if they play A1, you get 0.

So from your perspective:

- If you play A0: 
  - best: 5 (if they play A0)
  - worst: 0 (if they play A1)

- If you play A2:
  - best: 5 (if they play A2)
  - worst: 3 (if they play A1 or A0)

So **A2 has a higher minimum payoff**.

So it's **more robust**.

Moreover, by playing A2, you give the other player an **incentive to cooperate**, because if they play A0, they lose.

So rational players (including P1) are forced to choose A2 or A1.

But A2 gives them 5, A1 gives 3, so they don't choose A1.

So **A2 acts as a commitment device** that leads to mutual delegation.

Therefore, for **risk minimization and coordination**, **A2 is better**.

Also, if you **randomize**, you might get less than 5.

For example, if you play A0 with 50%, A2 with 50%, and P1 plays A0, you get 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 if P1 plays A0? No.

Let’s be precise.

Suppose P1 plays 50% A0, 50% A2.

Then your expected payoff from:
- If you play A0: P1 plays A0 (50%) → you get 5; P1 plays A2 (50%) → you get 0 → expected: 2.5
- If you play A2: P1 plays A0 → you get 3; P1 plays A2 → you get 5 → expected: 0.5*3 + 0.5*5 = 1.5 + 2.5 = 4

So 4 > 2.5 → better to play A2.

But if P1 is rational, they will not play A0 if you play A2 — they will play A2.

So the belief that P1 will play a best response is that they will play A2.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to **play A2 with probability 1**.

This guarantees you get 5, and induces the other player to cooperate.

So final answer:

- **A2: 100%**
- A0: 0
- A1: 0

This is optimal because:
- It gives you 5 with certainty if the other player acts rationally.
- It is risk-averse (worst-case payoff is 3, not 0).
- It incentivizes mutual delegation.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P1
response:
Let's analyze the game step by step to determine the optimal mixed strategy for Player 1 (you), taking into account:

- The original payoff structure.
- The new option: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.
- The behavior of the mediator:  
  - If **1 player** delegates to it → mediator plays **A0**.  
  - If **2 players** delegate to it → mediator plays **A0** (same result).  
  → Thus, **no matter how many players delegate**, the mediator always plays **A0**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the mediator’s behavior

Regardless of whether 1 or 2 players delegate to the mediator, the mediator will play A0.  
So:
- If you delegate (choose A2), your action becomes **A0**, no matter what the other player does.

This makes delegation effectively equivalent to **committing to A0**.

However, note that if **both players** delegate, the mediator still plays A0 — so both players are forced to play A0.  
But if **only you** delegate, then:
- You play A0 (via mediator),
- Other player plays their own action (A0, A1, or A2).

But **you cannot control the other player's action** — only the other player could choose to delegate.

---

### Step 2: Determine possible outcomes based on your choice

Let’s analyze your expected payoff under each of the three possible actions: A0, A1, A2.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ = probability that **Player 2** chooses A0.
- Let $ q $ = probability that Player 2 chooses A1.
- Let $ r $ = probability that Player 2 chooses A2 (Delegate).

So $ p + q + r = 1 $.

But since we are choosing a strategy and the game is symmetric in structure **but not in delegation**, we need to consider what **Player 2 might do**, and choose your strategy to be optimal **in response**.

But we are to pick a **single fixed strategy** (a mixed strategy over A0, A1, A2) that maximizes your expected payoff **against any strategy of the other player** — or rather, we assume both players are rational and will reason similarly.

So we are solving for a **Nash equilibrium**.

But since **you are in the role of Player 1**, and the mediator behavior is fixed (always plays A0 if delegated to), let’s analyze what the best response is.

---

### Step 3: Analyze payoffs for each choice

Let’s compute your expected payoff based on your choice and the other player’s choice.

Let’s define:

Let $ x $ = probability that Player 2 plays A0  
$ y $ = probability that Player 2 plays A1  
$ z $ = probability that Player 2 plays A2  
With $ x + y + z = 1 $

Now, compute your expected payoff for each action you can take.

---

#### Case 1: You play A0

Your action: A0  
Other player chooses:
- A0 (prob x): you get 5
- A1 (prob y): you get 0
- A2 (prob z): other player delegates, so they play A0 → so you play A0 vs A0 → you get 5

So your expected payoff when playing A0:
$$
EU(A0) = 5x + 0y + 5z = 5(x + z)
$$

---

#### Case 2: You play A1

Your action: A1  
Other player:
- A0 (x): you get 3 (since A1 vs A0 → you get 3)
- A1 (y): you get 3 (A1 vs A1 → 3)
- A2 (z): you play A1 vs A0 (since they delegated → A0), so you get 3

So:
$$
EU(A1) = 3x + 3y + 3z = 3(x + y + z) = 3
$$

This is constant! No matter what Player 2 does, **if you play A1, you get exactly 3 points.**

Interesting. So regardless of Player 2’s strategy, playing A1 gives you **3 points**.

---

#### Case 3: You play A2 (Delegate)

Then, mediator plays A0 for you → so you effectively play A0.

So your outcome is same as if you played A0 → same as Case 1.

Thus:
$$
EU(A2) = 5(x + z)
$$

Same as EU(A0)

So **playing A2 gives same expected payoff as playing A0**, because both result in A0 being played.

So:

- A0 → 5(x + z)
- A1 → 3
- A2 → 5(x + z)

So A0 and A2 are equivalent in payoff.

---

### Step 4: Best response depends on Player 2's mix

Your payoff depends on x and z (probability Player 2 plays A0 or delegates).

We now need to find your **optimal mixed strategy** such that you are indifferent among the actions you play, and your strategy is a best response to the other player’s (symmetric) strategy.

But the key insight: **A1 gives you 3 no matter what**, while A0 and A2 give you **5(x + z)**.

So whether A0 (or A2) is better than A1 depends on whether:

$$
5(x + z) > 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x + z > 0.6
$$

That is:
- If Player 2 plays A0 or delegates with total probability > 0.6, then A0/A2 are better than A1.
- Otherwise, A1 is better.

So if **both players are rational and symmetric**, we can look for a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

Assume both players use the same mixed strategy:
- p: prob A0
- q: prob A1
- r: prob A2
With $ p + q + r = 1 $

Then, for you, $ x = p $, $ z = r $

So your expected payoff from A0/A2: $ 5(p + r) $

From A1: 3

For you to be indifferent between A0 and A1, we need:
$$
5(p + r) = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p + r = 0.6
$$

But since $ p + q + r = 1 $, then $ q = 1 - (p + r) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 $

So if both players play:
- A0 with prob p
- A2 with prob r
- A1 with prob 0.4

and $ p + r = 0.6 $, then A0 and A2 are equally good as A1.

But is this sufficient for equilibrium? We need to ensure that **no player wants to deviate**.

In equilibrium, if a player is randomizing among A0, A2, and A1, then all must yield equal expected payoff.

We already have:
- A1 always gives 3
- A0 and A2 give $ 5(p + r) $
- So set $ 5(p + r) = 3 $ → $ p + r = 0.6 $
- So $ q = 0.4 $

Now, is this consistent?

But remember: if a player is playing A0 with prob p, A2 with prob r, and A1 with prob 0.4, then for the other player, the probability that this player chooses A0 or delegates is $ p + r = 0.6 $

So yes, consistent.

But **what about the relative mix between A0 and A2?**  
In the expected payoff, only $ p + r $ matters — because A0 and A2 give same payoff to you when you play them.

So **the exact distribution between A0 and A2 does not affect your expected payoff**, only their total probability.

So in equilibrium, we can **assign any split between A0 and A2 as long as $ p + r = 0.6 $, and $ q = 0.4 $**.

But **we are to pick a single strategy** that maximizes our own payoff.

But wait — is there a better strategy?

Suppose both players **always delegate** (r=1). Then both play A0 → each gets 5. But is this stable?

If Player 2 always delegates (r=1), then you observe that:
- If you play A0 → you play A0 vs A0 → get 5
- If you play A1 → you play A1 vs A0 → get 3
- If you play A2 → same as A0 → get 5

So you would prefer A0 or A2 over A1.

So if Player 2 always delegates, you should **not** play A1.

But then if **you deviate** to A0 or A2, you get 5 > 3. So stable only if both play A2.

But if both play A2, then both play A0 → both get 5.

But is this a **Nash equilibrium**?

Suppose Player 2 plays A2 (delegate) — so plays A0.

Then your best response:
- A0: 5
- A1: 3
- A2: 5

So best responses are A0 and A2.

So if you play A2, you are best responding.

Similarly for Player 2.

So (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium: both delegate → both play A0 → get 5 each.

But wait — earlier we also found a symmetric equilibrium where both play A1 with 0.4, and A0/A2 with total 0.6.

Now we have **multiple possible equilibria**?

Yes — this is a coordination game with multiple equilibria.

But which one do we pick?

We want to **maximize our own expected payoff**.

In the (A2, A2) equilibrium, you get 5.

In the mixed strategy equilibrium where $ q = 0.4 $, $ p + r = 0.6 $, then your expected payoff is **3**, because you are indifferent among actions.

But 3 < 5.

So to maximize your payoff, you'd prefer the equilibrium where both players delegate, and you get 5.

But here's the catch: **Can you ensure that both players delegate?**

The problem states:

> The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players.

So **the mediator exists and is available for both players** — but **you can choose to delegate or not**.

But **you cannot force Player 2 to delegate**.

So if you choose A2, you play A0.

But if Player 2 chooses A0, A1, or A2, then:

- If Player 2 plays A0 → you play A0 vs A0 → you get 5
- If Player 2 plays A1 → you play A0 vs A1 → you get 0 → bad
- If Player 2 plays A2 → you play A0 vs A0 → you get 5

So if you delegate (A2), your expected payoff is:
$$
P(\text{Player 2 plays A0}) \cdot 5 + P(\text{Player 2 plays A1}) \cdot 0 + P(\text{Player 2 plays A2}) \cdot 5
= 5(p + r)
$$

Same as before.

But Player 2 may not behave cooperatively.

So we must consider **rational behavior**.

Now suppose you are deciding your strategy, and assume that **Player 2 is also rational and will try to maximize their own payoff**.

So the game is symmetric: Player 2 is in your position.

So we are looking for a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s analyze possible symmetric equilibria.

---

### Candidate 1: Both always delegate (A2)

- You play A2 → you play A0
- Player 2 plays A2 → plays A0
- Outcome: A0 vs A0 → you get 5

Is this a best response?

For you: if Player 2 plays A2 (i.e., delegates), then:
- Your payoff from A0: 5
- From A1: 3
- From A2: 5

So best responses: A0 and A2.

So yes, A2 is a best response.

Similarly for Player 2.

So (A2, A2) is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**, and you get 5.

---

### Candidate 2: Both play A1

- You play A1
- Player 2 plays A1
- Outcome: A1 vs A1 → you get 3

Best response for you?

If Player 2 plays A1:
- A0: you get 3 (A0 vs A1 → you get 0? Wait — **no**)

Wait! Let's double-check the payoff table:

> - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points

> - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points

So if Player 2 plays A1, and you play A0 → you get 0  
If you play A1 → you get 3  
If you play A2 → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 vs A1 → get 0

So best response: **only A1** — gives you 3, others give 0.

So yes, A1 is best response.

So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium → you get 3.

---

### Candidate 3: Both play A0

- Outcome: A0 vs A0 → you get 5

Best response?

If Player 2 plays A0:
- A0: you get 5
- A1: you get 3
- A2: you play A0 (mediator) vs A0 → you get 5

So A0 and A2 are both best responses.

So (A0, A0) is also a NE → you get 5.

So we have **three pure Nash equilibria**:
- (A0, A0): you get 5
- (A2, A2): you get 5
- (A1, A1): you get 3

And possibly a mixed one with payoff 3.

So the **highest payoff** you can guarantee in equilibrium is **5**, in (A0, A0) or (A2, A2).

But you cannot **force** the other player to coordinate.

However, since the game is symmetric and rational players choose best responses, you might expect **coordination on a mutually beneficial outcome**.

But **there is no mechanism for coordination** — you have to pick a strategy.

But remember: the mediator **only plays A0** regardless of how many delegate.

So if **both players delegate**, you get 5.

If only you delegate, you get:
- 5 if Player 2 plays A0 or A2
- 0 if Player 2 plays A1

But if Player 2 plays A1, you get 0 — terrible.

So delegating is risky **if Player 2 might play A1**.

But in equilibrium, why would Player 2 play A1?

Player 2 would only play A1 if they believe you are playing something that makes A1 best.

But in symmetric equilibria, **A1 is not profitable** — you can always do better by playing A0 or A2 when others play A1.

So perhaps rational players will avoid A1?

But in (A1, A1), it is stable — but payoff is only 3.

Whereas in (A0, A0) and (A2, A2), payoff is 5 — better.

Is there a way to **co-ordinate on 5**?

Yes — but only if both choose A0 or both choose A2.

But there’s no mechanism.

However, note: **delegating to the mediator is a safe way to get A0**.

And **if both players delegate, both get 5**.

Moreover, **delegating is safe** — you don’t play A0 on your own, but the mediator does.

But if you delegate, you **commit** to A0.

Now, if you **always delegate**, then you get:
- 5 if Player 2 plays A0 or A2
- 0 if Player 2 plays A1

So your expected payoff if you play A2 (delegate) is $ 5(p + r) $

But if Player 2 is rational, will they play A1?

Only if they expect you to play something that makes A1 best.

But **if you delegate**, you are playing A0 — so Player 2’s best response depends on your action.

If you play A2 (delegate → A0), then:
- Player 2’s payoff from A0: you play A0, they play A0 → they get 5
- A1: you play A0, they play A1 → they get 3
- A2: you play A0, they play A0 → they get 5

So best responses: A0 and A2

So they would **not** play A1 — because A1 gives only 3, while A0 and A2 give 5.

So in this case, if **you delegate**, Rational Player 2 will also either play A0 or A2 to get 5.

So **if you delegate**, Player 2 will not play A1.

Therefore, your expected payoff if you play A2 is:
- $ P(\text{Player 2 plays A0 or A2}) = 1 $ (since they avoid A1)
- So you get 5

Thus, by delegating, you **induce the other player to avoid A1**, and they will pick A0 or A2, so you get 5.

Therefore, **if you delegate, you are guaranteed 5 points**, regardless of what Player 2 does (as long as they are rational).

Is that true?

Wait: if you delegate (play A2 → A0), then:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → you get 5
- If Player 2 plays A2 → you get 5
- If Player 2 plays A1 → you get 0

But if Player 2 is rational, and sees that you played A2 (so you are playing A0), then Player 2 knows:
- Playing A0 → get 5
- Playing A2 → get 5
- Playing A1 → get 3

So **they will not play A1** — because 3 < 5.

So they will play A0 or A2.

So **if you delegate**, and Player 2 is rational, then Player 2 plays A0 or A2 → you get 5.

Thus, your payoff is **5** with certainty.

Now, what if you play A0 instead?

Then:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → you get 5
- If Player 2 plays A1 → you get 0
- If Player 2 plays A2 → you get 5

But Player 2, seeing you played A0, will ask: what should I do?

- If I play A0 → I get 5
- If I play A1 → I get 3
- If I play A2 → I play A0 (mediator), you play A0 → I get 5

So again, Player 2 will play A0 or A2 → not A1.

So you still get 5.

Similarly, if you play A0, and Player 2 is rational, they play A0 or A2 → you get 5.

But if you play A1:
- Then you get 3 no matter what — because:
  - A0: A1 vs A0 → you get 3
  - A1: you get 3
  - A2: A1 vs A0 → you get 3

So you get 3.

So **if you play A1, you are stuck with 3**, regardless of Player 2.

But if you play A0 or A2, and Player 2 is rational, you get 5.

So **your best option is to play A0 or A2**, but not A1.

Now, between A0 and A2: they are symmetric — both lead to you playing A0, and in both cases, you get 5 if Player 2 is rational.

So you are indifferent between A0 and A2.

But perhaps there's an incentive to delegate?

Well, **if you delegate**, you are not directly choosing A0 — you are letting the mediator do it.

But the mediator doesn't care — it just plays A0.

But **in this case**, both A0 and A2 are equivalent in outcome.

However, let's see: if you play A0, and Player 2 plays A1, you get 0.

But only if Player 2 is irrational.

But we assume both players are rational.

So Player 2 will **not** play A1 if you play A0 or A2.

Thus, both A0 and A2 give you 5.

But **you need to choose a mixed strategy**.

But if you are **guaranteed 5** by playing A0 or A2, and only 3 by playing A1, you should **never play A1**.

So your strategy should assign **0 probability to A1**.

Now, among A0 and A2: both are equally good.

But there’s no reason to prefer one over the other.

So you can choose any mix between A0 and A2.

But remember: you need to **output a probability distribution**.

But if you choose only A0, that gives you 5.

If you choose only A2, you get 5.

If you mix, you still get 5.

But can you do better?

No.

But is there a reason to randomize?

Not really — but you can.

However, to maximize your **minimum payoff** (maximin), or guarantee 5, any strategy with **no A1** and **positive probability on A0 or A2** will get 5 **if Player 2 is rational**.

But **what if Player 2 is not rational**?

The problem says "you are playing a decision-making game with another player" — and "maximize your total points". We assume the other player is rational.

So we can assume Player 2 will play a best response.

So if you play A0 or A2, they will avoid A1 and play A0 or A2 → you get 5.

So your payoffs are:
- A0: 5
- A1: 3
- A2: 5

So **you should assign probability only to A0 and A2**, and avoid A1.

Now, how to split between A0 and A2?

No difference — both give same payoff.

But the problem asks for a **mixed strategy** with all three actions included, but we can assign 0 to A1.

But **"should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2"** — does that mean **must assign positive probability**?

Let’s check:

> "Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2."

This could be interpreted as: **the set of actions includes A0, A1, A2**, so you should have a probability for each.

But it doesn’t say "positive" — but “include” might mean that all are part of the strategy, but could be zero.

But in game theory, “include” often means the action set includes them — but probability can be zero.

However, the instruction says:

> "Keys must be the action names exactly as given."

So we must include "A0", "A1", "A2".

And values must be integers summing to 100.

So we **can** have 0 for A1.

But is there a reason to include A1 with positive probability?

Only if it gives better payoff — but it gives only 3, while others give 5.

So including A1 reduces your expected payoff.

So optimal strategy is to set **A1 = 0**, and split 100 between A0 and A2.

But how to split?

Since both give 5, **any split is optimal**.

But to make it symmetric, or to avoid bias, we can split equally: 50 for A0, 50 for A2.

Or you could put all on one — but since the problem says "mixed strategy", it may imply randomness.

But even if you play pure A0 or A2, it’s still a mixed strategy (with prob 1 on one action).

So both are acceptable.

But perhaps best to **avoid A1** entirely.

So let’s choose:
- A0: 50
- A2: 50
- A1: 0

Or:
- A0: 100
- A2: 0
- A1: 0

Both are valid.

But since you are allowed to delegate, and the mediator is available, **delegating might be seen as a safe way to commit to A0**, avoiding the risk of making a mistake.

But in this case, since both actions give same payoff, and you are rational, it doesn’t matter.

But to be safe and **guarantee 5** with no risk, you could choose A0 or A2.

But since **if you delegate, you don't need to compute your own action**, it’s a form of commitment.

But in terms of payoff, same.

So let’s pick a simple symmetric distribution: 50% A0, 50% A2, 0% A1.

But is there a better option?

Wait — suppose you play A2 with high probability.

But if you play A2 (delegate), and Player 2 sees you playing A2, then they know you are playing A0.

Then as before, they will play A0 or A2 → you get 5.

Similarly if you play A0.

So no issue.

But what if you play A1 with small probability?

Then with that small probability, you get only 3.

But if the other player is rational, they will not play A1 when you play A0 or A2.

But if you play A1 sometimes, then when you play A1, Player 2 might react.

But Player 2, if they see you play A1, then:

- If they play A0 → they get 0 (since you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3, they get 0)
- If they play A1 → both get 3
- If they play A2 → mediator plays A0, you play A1 → you get 3, they get 0

So if you play A1, Player 2’s best response is to play A1 (get 3), or A0 or A2 (get 0)

So best is to play A1 → get 3.

So if you play A1, Player 2 will play A1.

Then you get 3.

So if you play A1 with probability q, and Player 2 responds rationally, then when you play A1, Player 2 plays A1 → you get 3.

When you play A0 or A2, you get 5.

So your expected payoff = q × 3 + (1−q) × 5 = 5 − 2q

This is **less than 5** for any q > 0.

So it’s worse.

Therefore, **you should not assign any positive probability to A1**.

So A1 = 0.

Now, between A0 and A2: both give 5.

So your optimal strategy is: any mix of A0 and A2, with A1 = 0.

To pick one, let’s choose **equal probability**: 50% A0, 50% A2.

This is symmetric and safe.

Alternatively, you could choose 60% A0, 40% A2, but no benefit.

But since the mediator may be seen as a tool to commit, and you want to maximize the chance of coordination, **delegating might be more strategic** — but in this case, no difference.

So we pick:

- A0: 50
- A1: 0
- A2: 50

Sum: 100.

Final answer:

{"A0": 50, "A1": 0, "A2": 50}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step, taking into account the standard game structure, the payoff matrix, and the new twist involving the mediator.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

The base game is a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoffs, since we're Player 1) is:

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 5            | 0            |
| **Player 1: A1** | 3            | 3            |

We’re Player 1, and we’re deciding on a mixed strategy over A0, A1, and the new action **A2 (Delegate to Mediator)**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

- You can choose to **delegate** (A2).
- The mediator plays based on **how many players delegate to it**:
  - If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
  - If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So:
- If **you delegate (A2)** and **Player 2 does NOT delegate**, then **mediator plays A1** → you get the payoff as if you played A1.
- If **you delegate (A2)** and **Player 2 also delegates**, then **mediator plays A0** → you get the payoff as if you played A0.
- If you **don’t delegate**, you choose your own action (A0 or A1) — but the mediator is **only involved if you delegate**.

Also, **Player 2** can also delegate or not.

So the delegation outcome depends on **both players’ choices**.

---

### **Step 3: Consider the Game Structure with Delegation**

Now our available actions are:
- A0: play A0 independently
- A1: play A1 independently
- A2: delegate to mediator

We must choose a mixed strategy: probabilities over A0, A1, A2 such that they sum to 100.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ = probability you play A0
- Let $ q $ = probability you play A1
- Let $ r $ = probability you play A2

Then $ p + q + r = 100 $

But we need to model the **expected payoff** under different scenarios depending on **Player 2’s strategy**, which we don't know.

But since this is a decision-making game where both players choose simultaneously and independently, we assume **rationality and symmetry** — we should look for a **Nash equilibrium**, or at least a **best response** given that both players are rational.

But since **you are only selecting your own strategy**, and we are to **maximize your expected payoff**, we assume that Player 2 is also rational and will try to maximize their own payoff.

Therefore, we must **find a symmetric or stable equilibrium** where both players choose strategies that are best responses to each other.

But the game has a twist: the mediator’s behavior depends on count of delegators.

Also, note that the mediator is **selected via approval voting**, meaning that both players agreed to use it, so both know its rules.

---

### **Step 4: Consider Possible Outcomes Based on Delegation**

Let’s define possible states based on whether you and Player 2 delegate.

#### Case 1: You delegate (A2), Player 2 does **not** delegate  
→ Mediator gets 1 delegate → plays **A1**  
→ You play A1 (in effect), Player 2 plays their choice (A0 or A1)

Your payoff in this subcase depends on Player 2’s action:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → you get 3 (since you played A1, they played A0)
- If Player 2 plays A1 → you get 3 (both play A1)

→ So **you always get 3** in this case, regardless of what Player 2 does.

So in this case: **your payoff = 3**

#### Case 2: You delegate (A2), Player 2 **also** delegates  
→ Mediator gets 2 delegates → plays **A0**  
→ You play A0 (in effect), Player 2 plays A0

→ So both are playing A0 → you get **5**

#### Case 3: You do **not** delegate → you play A0 or A1
Then Player 2 can play A0, A1, or A2

But since both are rational, we must consider what Player 2 would do.

Let’s now **analyze symmetric equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 5: Assume Symmetric Rational Strategy**

Let’s suppose both players use the same strategy: play A0 with probability $ a $, A1 with $ b $, A2 with $ c $, where $ a + b + c = 1 $

Then, for each player, we can compute expected payoff.

But since we are the only one choosing (and want to maximize our own payoff), and we know that Player 2 is rational too, we want to find the **best response** to Player 2’s possible strategy.

Let’s instead try to **find symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium** where both players do the same.

But let’s try to **reason about best choices**.

---

### **Step 6: Evaluate Payoff for Each of Your Possible Actions**

Let’s suppose you fix a pure strategy and see what happens.

#### Option 1: Play A0 always (p = 100)

Then:
- If Player 2 plays A0: you get 5
- If Player 2 plays A1: you get 0
- If Player 2 delegates: then mediator plays A1 (since only one delegate — you), so Player 2 plays A1 → you play A0, Player 2 plays A1 → you get 0

So if Player 2 plays a mix including A1 or A2 (delegate), your payoff drops.

So if Player 2 plays A1 with high probability, you get 0 often.

So A0 is risky if Player 2 is not cooperating.

#### Option 2: Play A1 always (q = 100)

Then:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → you get 3
- If Player 2 plays A1 → you get 3
- If Player 2 delegates → they play A1 (since only one delegate), so A1 vs A1 → you get 3

So **regardless of Player 2's choice, if you play A1, you get 3**

→ Your payoff is **always 3**

Interesting!

So if you play A1 (independently), no matter what Player 2 does, you get **3**.

But is it possible to get **more than 3**?

Yes — if both play A0, you get 5.

But you can’t force that.

Now consider **delegation**.

#### Option 3: Play A2 (delegate) always

Then:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, Player 2 plays A0 → you get 3
- If Player 2 plays A1 → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, Player 2 plays A1 → you get 3
- If Player 2 also delegates → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0, Player 2 plays A0 → you get 5

So your payoff depends on Player 2:
- If Player 2 **does not** delegate → you get 3
- If Player 2 **does** delegate → you get 5

So if you delegate **and** Player 2 delegates, you get 5 — which is better than 3.

But if only you delegate, you get 3 — same as playing A1.

So **delegation only beats A1 if Player 2 also delegates**.

Thus, delegation is **only beneficial if both delegate**.

But will Player 2 want to delegate?

Let’s now **think from Player 2’s perspective**.

Suppose you (Player 1) always delegate (A2). What should Player 2 do?

Player 2 faces:
- If Player 2 plays A0: you played A2 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → Player 2 plays A0 → Player 2 gets 0 (since you A1, Player 2 A0 → 0 for Player 2)
- If Player 2 plays A1: you play A1 (via mediator), Player 2 plays A1 → Player 2 gets 3
- If Player 2 plays A2: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → Player 2 gets 5

So Player 2’s payoffs:
- A0 → 0
- A1 → 3
- A2 → 5

So best for Player 2 is to **delegate**.

So if you delegate, Player 2 will **also delegate** (since A2 gives them 5, best option).

Then you both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get **5**

So if **you delegate**, and **Player 2 is rational**, then **Player 2 will delegate as well**, so **you both get 5**

Thus, by delegating, you get **5**.

Compare to playing A1 → you get 3.

So **delegation is better than A1**, if you can get Player 2 to also delegate.

And it **induces** Player 2 to delegate (because it's their best response).

So is **always delegate (A2)** a dominant strategy?

Wait — but what if **Player 2 does not delegate**?

But if you delegate and Player 2 does not, you get 3. But Player 2 knows that if they don’t delegate, they get only 3 (if you delegate and they play A1) or 0 (if they play A0). But if they delegate, they get 5.

So **Player 2 always gets more by delegating if you delegate**.

Thus, **if you delegate, Player 2 will delegate** → you get 5.

So as long as you delegate, **you get 5**.

Compare:
- A0: if you play A0, you could get 5 or 0 (depending on Player 2), but unlikely to coordinate
- A1: you get 3 for sure
- A2: you get 5 (if Player 2 responds rationally) → **better**

So **A2 (delegate)** seems better.

But what if **you don't delegate**?

Let’s suppose you **do not delegate**, i.e., you play A0 or A1.

Then Player 2 can choose to delegate, or not.

But earlier, we saw that **if you don't delegate**, then:
- If Player 2 delegates → mediator plays A1 → they play A1
- So Player 2 effectively plays A1
- Then their payoff depends on what you play.

Let’s suppose you play A0 independently.

Then:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → payoff 5 for both
- If Player 2 plays A1 → you get 0, they get 3
- If Player 2 delegates → they play A1 → you get 0, they get 3

So Player 2’s payoffs:
- A0: 5
- A1: 3
- A2: 3

So best for them is to play A0 → get 5.

So if you play A0, Player 2 will play A0.

Then you both get 5.

Similarly, if **you play A1**, and Player 2 is rational:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → you get 3, they get 0
- If Player 2 plays A1 → you get 3, they get 3
- If Player 2 delegates → plays A1 → you get 3, they get 3

So Player 2’s payoffs:
- A0 → 0
- A1 → 3
- A2 → 3

So they prefer A1 or A2 → get 3 each.

So they will do A1 or A2 (both give 3), so **they will play A1 or A2**.

But if they play A1 or A2, you get 3.

So if you play A1, you get 3.

So:
- If you play A0: Player 2 plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A1: Player 2 plays A1/A2 → you get 3
- If you delegate: Player 2 delegates → you get 5

So both **A0** and **A2** give you 5, **A1** gives only 3.

So you should **not** play A1.

So your best options are **A0 or A2**, both of which can get you 5 **if Player 2 responds optimally**.

But can you get **more than 5**? No — maximum is 5.

So both A0 and A2 can give you 5, A1 gives 3.

So **you should avoid A1**.

But is there a reason to prefer A0 over A2?

Wait: what if Player 2 is not rational or doesn’t respond as assumed?

But we assume **rationality**, so we assume players will best respond.

So:
- If you play A0 → Player 2 gets 5 by playing A0 → so they will play A0 → you get 5
- If you play A2 → Player 2 gets 5 only by playing A2 (delegate) → they will play A2 → you get 5

So both lead to **you getting 5**.

But is there a difference?

What if you play **A0 with some probability**, and **A2 with some probability**?

But let’s suppose we play a **mixed strategy** between A0 and A2, avoiding A1.

But why would we do that?

Wait: in both cases (playing A0 or A2), we get **5** in equilibrium.

But what if **Player 2 plays differently**?

Let’s suppose you play A2.

Then, as we saw, Player 2’s best response is **A2 (delegate)**, because:
- A0 → you play A1 (mediator plays A1), they play A0 → they get 0
- A1 → you play A1, they play A1 → they get 3
- A2 → you play A0 (mediator plays A0), they play A0 → they get 5 → best

So they **must** play A2.

So **only** A2 leads to payoff 5 for you.

But for **A0** as a choice: if you play A0, then Player 2’s best response is to play A0 (get 5), so they will.

So both A0 and A2 lead to **5 for you**, and both are best responses for Player 2.

So no difference.

But now consider: **what if you play A0 with 100%?**

Then you get 5.

But what if **Player 2 doesn’t play A0**? But then they’d be worse off.

No — if you play A0, and they play A1 or A2, they get 3 or 0, worse than 5.

So they will play A0.

Same for delegation.

But now consider **if you mix**.

Suppose you play A0 with 50%, A2 with 50%, A1 with 0%.

Then what does Player 2 do?

Let’s compute Player 2’s expected payoff based on your strategy.

You:
- A0 with 50%
- A2 with 50%

So two cases:

#### Case 1: You play A0 (50%)
- Player 2 plays A0 → you get 5, they get 5
- Player 2 plays A1 → you get 0, they get 3
- Player 2 plays A2 → you get 5 (both A0), they get 5

So Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If they play A0: 5×0.5 + 5×0.5 = 5
- If they play A1: 3×0.5 + 3×0.5 = 3
- If they play A2: 5×0.5 + 5×0.5 = 5

So best for them are A0 and A2 → both give 5 → they can choose either.

So they will choose A0 or A2. Suppose they pick A0 → then you get 5 when you play A0, and 3 when you play A2 (because you delegate → only one delegate → mediator A1 → you play A1 → they play A0 → you get 3)

Wait! This is **crucial**.

Let’s be precise:

- If you play A0 (50%): then Player 2 plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A2 (50%): then Player 2 plays A0 → you are delegating, they are not → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → they play A0 → you get 3

So your expected payoff in this case:
- 50% × 5 = 2.5
- 50% × 3 = 1.5
→ **Total expected payoff: 4**

But if you play **A2 with 100%**, and Player 2 is rational, they will **also delegate**, so you get 5.

But if you mix, and Player 2 plays A0 (best for them), you only get **4** on average.

So mixing reduces your payoff.

Similarly, if you mix A0 and A2, and Player 2 best responds, you **do not get 5** in all cases — only in some.

But if you play **A2 alone**, then Player 2 **must** delegate → you get 5.

Similarly, if you play **A0 alone**, Player 2 must play A0 → you get 5.

But only **if you play pure A0 or pure A2**.

If you mix, Player 2 may not be able to achieve the same best outcome, and you may end up with sub-5.

Thus, **playing pure A0 or pure A2** gives you **5**, but playing a mix could give less **unless** Player 2 is also mixing.

But since both players can best respond, we need to find a stable equilibrium.

Let’s now **test the pure strategy: Play A2 (Delegate) 100%**

Then Player 2’s best response is A2 → both delegate → you play A0 → you get 5

So it works.

Similarly, **Play A0 100%** → Player 2 plays A0 → you get 5

So both pure strategies give you 5.

But now, **is there an incentive to deviate?**

Suppose you play A0 100%, Player 2 plays A0 100%. You get 5.

But if you deviate to A2, then:
- You play A2 → Player 2 plays A0 (still best for them), so only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3 < 5

So **you get less** → don’t want to deviate.

Similarly, if both play A2: you get 5.

If you deviate to A0, then:
- You play A0, they are playing A2 → they are delegating, so mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → both A0 → you get 5 → same

So deviating to A0 gives you 5 (same), so no gain.

But in both cases, you get 5.

But now: **what if you play A1?** You get 3, worse than 5, so no.

So both **A0** and **A2** are **equilibrium strategies**.

But **which one maximizes your expected payoff in equilibrium?**

Both give 5.

But is there a **risk of getting less**?

In the **A0 strategy**, if you play A0, and say Player 2 plays A1, you get 0.

But if Player 2 is rational, they won’t do that — they get 0, while getting 5 by playing A0.

So only **rational Player 2 will play A0**.

Same for A2: only rational Player 2 will play A2.

So both are **equilibrium** and give **5**.

Now: are there **mixed strategies** that can give **more than 5**? No — max is 5.

So any strategy that gets **5 on average** is fine.

But can we design a strategy that **guarantees** 5?

Only if we **commit** to a pure strategy that forces the other player to coordinate.

But in mixed strategy, if you mix, and they mix, you might get less.

But here’s a key insight:

If you play A2 (delegate), then **Player 2’s best response is A2**, so you get 5.

If you play A0, Player 2’s best response is A0 → you get 5.

But now, suppose **both players are symmetric**, and we're in symmetric equilibrium.

Let’s suppose both players play **A2 with probability 1** → then it’s equilibrium.

Similarly, both play A0 → equilibrium.

But is there a **symmetric mixed strategy**?

Suppose both players play:
- A0 with probability p
- A1 with probability q
- A2 with probability r
- p + q + r = 1

Now, compute expected payoff for one player.

But this is complex.

But recall: if you play A1, you get 3 in all cases (as we saw earlier: no matter what Player 2 does, you get 3)

So playing A1 is a **dominated strategy** — never better than 3.

So **in any equilibrium, players will not play A1**.

So q = 0.

So only A0 and A2.

So suppose you play A0 with prob p, A2 with prob 1-p.

Player 2 does the same.

Now compute your expected payoff.

Cases:

1. You play A0 (prob p), Player 2 plays A0 (prob p): → both play A0 → you get 5 → contribution: p×p×5

2. You play A0 (p), Player 2 plays A2 (1-p): → you play A0, they play A2 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0 → contribution: p×(1-p)×0

3. You play A2 (1-p), Player 2 plays A0 (p): → you delegate, they don't → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3 → contribution: (1-p)×p×3

4. You play A2 (1-p), Player 2 plays A2 (1-p): → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → you get 5 → contribution: (1-p)×(1-p)×5

So your expected payoff:

$$
E = p^2 \cdot 5 + p(1-p) \cdot 0 + (1-p)p \cdot 3 + (1-p)^2 \cdot 5
$$

$$
= 5p^2 + 0 + 3p(1-p) + 5(1 - 2p + p^2)
$$
$$
= 5p^2 + 3p - 3p^2 + 5 - 10p + 5p^2
$$
$$
= (5p^2 - 3p^2 + 5p^2) + (3p - 10p) + 5
$$
$$
= 7p^2 - 7p + 5
$$

Now, we want to **maximize** this expected payoff over p ∈ [0,1]

So maximize $ E(p) = 7p^2 - 7p + 5 $

This is a quadratic in p, opening upwards (coefficient 7>0), so minimum at vertex, maximum at endpoints.

Vertex at $ p = \frac{7}{2 \times 7} = 0.5 $

So minimum at p=0.5, maximum at endpoints.

Compute:
- p=0: E = 0 - 0 + 5 = 5
- p=1: E = 7 - 7 + 5 = 5
- p=0.5: E = 7(0.25) -7(0.5) + 5 = 1.75 - 3.5 + 5 = 3.25

So maximum expected payoff is **5**, achieved at p=0 and p=1.

So **pure strategy** is best: either always A0 or always A2.

Both give E=5.

Now, which one to pick?

We want to **maximize our payoff**.

Both give 5.

But now: **is there any reason to prefer one over the other?**

Consider **risk**.

But in equilibrium, both are stable.

But note: if you play A2, and Player 2 plays A0, you get 3.

But in the **symmetric equilibrium**, Player 2 plays A2, so you get 5.

Same for A0.

But now, suppose you are **not** in a symmetric equilibrium, but you assume Player 2 is rational.

Then:

- If you play A0: Player 2’s best response is A0 → you get 5
- If you play A2: Player 2’s best response is A2 → you get 5

Same.

But **what if Player 2 deviates?** But we assume rationality.

So either is fine.

But now: **which strategy is more robust**?

Wait — suppose you play A2.

Then:
- If Player 2 plays A0: you get 3
- If Player 2 plays A1: you get 3
- If Player 2 plays A2: you get 5

So best outcome is 5, worst is 3.

But if you play A0:
- If Player 2 plays A0: you get 5
- If Player 2 plays A1: you get 0
- If Player 2 plays A2: you get 0

So worst outcome is 0!

So playing A0 has **worse worst-case payoff** than playing A2.

If Player 2 is irrational and plays A1 or A2, you get 0.

But if you play A2, even if Player 2 plays A1, you get 3.

So **A2 is less risky**.

Moreover, **Player 2 has no incentive to play A1 or A0 if you play A2** — because they get 0 or 3, while A2 gives 5.

So rational Player 2 **must** play A2.

But if you play A0, Player 2 must play A0 — but if they play A1 or A2, they get less than 5.

But they **would not** do that — so it’s rational to play A0.

But the **risk** of low payoff is higher in A0 if Player 2 makes a mistake.

But under rationality, it’s fine.

However, **A2 gives you better worst-case payoff**.

Therefore, **A2 is superior**.

Also, **A1 is dominated**.

So optimal strategy: **always delegate (A2) with 100%**.

Then you get 5, Player 2 gets 5, and it’s stable.

No incentive to deviate.

### **Final Decision**

Since:
- Playing A2 leads to 5
- Playing A0 leads to 5 (in equilibrium), but worse worst-case
- Playing A1 leads to only 3 (dominated)
- A2 is more robust

Therefore, **best strategy is to play A2 with 100% probability**

### ✅ Final Answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}
