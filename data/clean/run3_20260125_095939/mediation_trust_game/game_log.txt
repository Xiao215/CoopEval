response:
To maximize points in this game, we need to move the outcome from the Nash equilibrium of (A1, A1), which gives each player 4 points, to the cooperative outcome of (A0, A0), which gives each player 10 points. However, the game is asymmetrical: while Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1, Player 1's best response depends on Player 2's action.

Designing the mediator:
1.  **When two players delegate (Case 2):** The mediator should play **A0**. If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0 for both, resulting in the (A0, A0) payoff where both receive 10 points. This is the best mutual outcome.
2.  **When one player delegates (Case 1):** The mediator should play **A1**. This is the "safe" action.
    - If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not, the mediator plays A1 for Player 1. Knowing this, Player 2's best response is A1, leading to a (4, 4) payoff. If the mediator played A0 here, Player 2 would play A1, leaving Player 1 with 0 points.
    - If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 does not, the mediator plays A1 for Player 2. Knowing this, Player 1's best response is A1, leading to a (4, 4) payoff.

By choosing {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}, delegation becomes a weakly dominant strategy for both players. If the other player delegates, you get 10 points by delegating and 4-10 points by not delegating. If the other player does not delegate, you get 4 points by delegating and 4 points by not delegating. 

This mediator is also likely to be approved by Player 2 because it offers a path to 10 points (instead of the 4 points they would get in the Nash equilibrium) without making them vulnerable to exploitation (since the mediator plays the safe A1 if Player 1 fails to delegate).

response:
To maximize the total points for both players, the key is to reach the outcome (A0, A0), which yields the highest mutual payoff of (10, 10). The Nash Equilibrium of the base game is (A1, A1), yielding (4, 4). A successful mediator should incentivize both players to delegate, resulting in the (10, 10) outcome.

If both players delegate, the mediator must choose A0 to achieve the (10, 10) payoff. If the mediator chose A1, the outcome would be (4, 4).

Suppose the mediator chooses A1 when only one player delegates. 
- If Player 1 delegates (P1=A1), Player 2’s best response is A1 (since 4 > 2), leading to (4, 4). 
- If Player 2 (you) delegates (P2=A1), Player 1’s best response is A1 (since 4 > 0), leading to (4, 4). 
In this scenario, delegation becomes a weakly dominant strategy for both players. If both delegate, they receive 10. If one or neither delegates, they receive 4. This makes delegation "safe" and mutually beneficial.

Suppose the mediator chooses A0 when only one player delegates.
- If Player 2 delegates (P2=A0), Player 1 best responds with A0 to get 10, leading to (10, 10). 
- If Player 1 delegates (P1=A0), Player 2 (you) best responds with A1 to get 20, leading to (0, 20). 
This asymmetry makes delegating risky for Player 1 (getting 0) and highly beneficial for Player 2. Player 1 would likely not approve this mediator or would choose not to delegate.

A symmetric and safe mediator (M(1)=A1, M(2)=A0) is the most likely to be approved by both players and lead to the optimal outcome of 10 points each.

response:
To get both players to approve (and later want to delegate), the mediator should:

- **When 2 players delegate:** play **A0** so the outcome is **(A0, A0)** giving **(10,10)**, which is better for both than the baseline Nash outcome (A1, A1) = (4,4).
- **When only 1 player delegates:** play **A1** to avoid the “sucker” risk where a lone delegator playing A0 could be exploited (other plays A1, delegator gets 0). If the mediator plays A1 for the lone delegator, the natural best response for the non-delegator is A1, giving **(4,4)**—no worse than baseline for either side.

response:
Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine the best strategy for designing the mediator:

### Understanding the Payoff Matrix
We start by analyzing the payoff matrix to understand the implications of each action:

1. If both players choose A0:
   - Player 1: 10 points
   - Player 2: 10 points

2. If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
   - Player 1: 0 points
   - Player 2: 20 points

3. If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
   - Player 1: 6 points
   - Player 2: 2 points

4. If both players choose A1:
   - Player 1: 4 points
   - Player 2: 4 points

From this, we observe that:
- Both players choosing A0 gives each player 10 points (the highest score when both choose the same action).
- If one player "defects" (chooses A1 while the other chooses A0), the defecting player gets 6 or 20 points (higher if they can ensure the other chooses A0).
- Both players choosing A1 gives each of them 4 points.

### Determining Mediator Actions
The mediator must be designed to encourage behaviors that maximize the total points received by both players. We aim to reach either mutual cooperation (A0, A0) or some balanced mix that yields high scores.

### Possible Mediator Strategies
Given that the mediator can see how many players are delegating before selecting an action, we can consider the following strategies:

1. **If 1 player delegates:**
   - Play A1. This ensures at least a safety net of points since one possibility is that the independent player may choose A0 or A1, and in either case, A1 is relatively safe because:
     - If the independent player chooses A0, the delegating player gets 6 points.
     - If the independent player chooses A1, both get 4 points.

2. **If 2 players delegate:**
   - Play A0. To maximize points (10 points each), since mutual delegation will result in the mediator choosing the same action for both.

### Designing the Mediator
Based on this analysis, our mediator should employ the following strategy:

1. If 1 player delegates, the mediator plays "A1".
2. If 2 players delegate, the mediator plays "A0".

Here’s the JSON object representing this mediator:

```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```

This strategy maximizes the expected points since:
- With 1 delegation, A1 is a safe choice.
- With full delegation, A0 maximizes total points, reinforcing mutual trust among players to delegate.

response:
Both players’ unique Nash equilibrium when acting independently is \(A1,A1\) (you get 4, other gets 4). A mediator can improve outcomes by making “both delegate” lead to the mutually better coordination outcome \(A0,A0\) (10 each). To keep delegation safe for a lone delegator (so approving the mediator isn’t scary), set the mediator to play \(A1\) when exactly one player delegates (since \(A1\) is your dominant action and also avoids giving the other player an incentive to exploit a lone delegator).

This makes:
- 2 delegators \(\rightarrow A0,A0\): (10,10) (Pareto-improves over (4,4))
- 1 delegator \(\rightarrow\) delegator plays \(A1\): tends to yield (4,4) rather than something worse

response:
Sure, let's break down the task and design a mediator step-by-step.

### Understanding the Payoff Matrix

Let's first recap the payoffs for each possible outcome:
- Both choose A0: You get 10, Other Player gets 10.
- You choose A1, Other Player chooses A0: You get 20, Other Player gets 0.
- You choose A0, Other Player chooses A1: You get 2, Other Player gets 6.
- Both choose A1: You get 4, Other Player gets 4.

### Analyzing the Payoffs

To maximize the total points:

1. If both players delegate to the mediator, the goal is to choose the action that maximizes joint payoffs:
   - (A0, A0) yields a total of 20 (10 + 10).
   - (A1, A0) results in 20 (20 + 0).
   - (A0, A1) results in 8 (2 + 6).
   - (A1, A1) results in 8 (4 + 4).

   The choices (A0, A0) and (A1, A0) both result in the highest total points of 20. However, (A1, A0) is asymmetrical and might not maximize points consistently if both players end up taking mixed actions independently. On the other hand, (A0, A0) is stable and provides a fair distribution of points.

2. If only one player delegates to the mediator:
   - If the mediator chooses A1, the independent player is inclined to choose A0 to gain 0 points, resulting in an unbalanced preference.
   - If the mediator chooses A0, the independent player might choose A1, leading to 2 points for the mediator and 6 for the independent player.

To avoid ambiguity and ensure both delegating players maximize joint points, it's reasonable for the mediator to select A0 when all players delegate to it.

### Proposal for the Mediator Behavior
- If one player delegates, the mediator should choose the action that is evenly advantageous and likely to make the independent player choose in a way that doesn't lead to confusion or unbalanced payoffs.

Considering these thoughts, here is the JSON object for the proposed mediator:

```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```

### Reasoning for the Decision

- **When one player delegates**: Choosing A0 makes the independent player more likely to obtain a predictable outcome with the choices they want to optimize (either playing to get 10 points for mutual action or 6 points).
- **When both players delegate**: Choosing A0 ensures the highest total score (10 + 10 = 20), creating stability and predictability.

Summarizing the final adjusted answer:

```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

From my perspective (Player 1), the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 10, other gets 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 20  
- (A1, A0): I get 6, other gets 2
- (A1, A1): I get 4, other gets 4

**Key observation**: The other player has A1 as a dominant strategy (always gets more from A1 regardless of my choice). The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoff (4, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the opportunity

The (A0, A0) outcome gives both players 10 points - much better than the Nash equilibrium of 4 points each. However, without coordination, we can't reach it because:
- If I play A0, the other player is incentivized to play A1 (getting 20 instead of 10)
- This leaves me with 0 points

A mediator can solve this coordination problem!

## Step 3: Design mediator strategy

**When 2 players delegate**: The mediator should play **A0** for both
- Result: Both get 10 points (the cooperative outcome)

**When 1 player delegates**: The mediator should play **A1** for the delegator
- If only I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me → other's best response is A1 → I get 4 (protected from getting 0)
- If only other delegates: Mediator plays A1 for them → my best response is A1 → I get 4

## Step 4: Verify appeal for approval voting

This mediator is attractive to both players because:
1. **Mutual delegation** achieves (10, 10) - a significant improvement over (4, 4)
2. **Unilateral delegation** is safe - guarantees at least 4 points, preventing exploitation
3. **Symmetric treatment** - both players face the same incentives

The mediator creates a strong incentive for mutual delegation while protecting individual delegators.

**Final Answer:**

{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediator)**

We are Player 2 in a simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (where rows are Player 1's choices, columns are Player 2's choices):

|             | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

We are Player 2, so our payoffs are:
- If we play A0:
  - Opponent A0 → 10
  - Opponent A1 → 2
- If we play A1:
  - Opponent A0 → 20
  - Opponent A1 → 4

We want to maximize our own expected payoff, but we’re also designing a **mediator**, and the other player will be designing one too.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the mediator mechanism**

- Each player can choose to **delegate** their move to a mediator or act independently.
- The mediator observes how many players delegate (1 or 2).
- Then, the mediator **plays the same action for all delegating players** (i.e., it's a "joint" move for all who delegate).
- So, if both players delegate: mediator plays one action (A0 or A1) for both.
- If only one delegates: mediator plays an action for that one player.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen via approval voting. We and the other player will **approve** one or more mediators (ours and theirs), and the one with the most approvals wins. If tie, random selection.

So, our goal is to **design a mediator** that:
1. **Maximizes our expected payoff** in the endgame (when it’s selected).
2. Is **likely to be approved** by us and the other player (i.e., makes the other player want to approve it too — because otherwise we risk them choosing their own).

But here's the key: we don’t get to pick the mediator unilaterally — it's chosen by **approval voting**. So we need to design a mediator that is **appealing** to both players, so that we each want to approve it.

Why would the other player approve our mediator? Because it gives them a good outcome. Similarly, we will approve it only if it helps us.

So this is a **strategic design of a mediator** under **approval voting**, where we want our mediator to win.

Hence, we should aim to build a mediator that:
- Gives **good outcomes for both players**, especially in the case when **both delegate**, because then the mediator plays the same action for both.
- Makes both players **willing to approve it**.

---

### **Step 3: Consider possible delegations and outcomes**

We'll consider what happens under different delegation configurations:

#### Case 1: Nobody delegates (both play independently)
- Game is original: player 1 picks a strategy, player 2 (we) picks one.
- We can choose a mixed strategy, but we’re trying to design a mediator that makes both players want to delegate.

But we are designing a **mediator** that may be chosen if both players **delegate**.

#### Case 2: Only one player delegates
- The mediator plays one action.
- That player gets that action, the other acts independently.
- But since mediator acts on behalf of the delegator, we have to specify what it does depending on whether 1 or 2 players delegate.

#### Case 3: Both delegate
- The mediator plays a single action (A0 or A1) for both.
- We must recommend an action that benefits both, or at least doesn't harm either too much, so that both want to delegate and approve this mediator.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze what actions the mediator should play for each number of delegators**

Let’s denote the mediator’s strategy as:

```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A1"}
```

Meaning:
- If 1 player delegates: mediator plays A0 for them.
- If 2 players delegate: mediator plays A1 for both.

But we must **design** this.

#### **Key idea**: For a mediator to be successful in approval voting, it should lead to **better outcomes than independent play**, or at least **comparable**, for both players.

Let’s analyze **what the rational outcome would be in independent play**, then see if we can create a mediator that provides a better or fairer outcome.

---

### **Step 5: Compute best responses in the base game**

We are Player 2.

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays a mixed strategy: p for A0, (1-p) for A1.

Our expected payoff for choosing A0:
- p * 10 + (1-p) * 2 = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2

For choosing A1:
- p * 20 + (1-p) * 4 = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4

We prefer A1 when:
16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → 8p > -2 → always true? Wait:
→ 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → 8p > -2 → true for all p ≥ 0.

But let’s compute the threshold:

16p + 4 = 8p + 2 → 8p = -2 → negative p, impossible.

So A1 always dominates A0 for Player 2?

Wait: at p=0 (Player 1 plays A1), we get:
- A0: 2
- A1: 4 → A1 better

At p=1 (Player 1 plays A0), we get:
- A0: 10
- A1: 20 → A1 still better

So for **Player 2**, **A1 strictly dominates A0** — no matter what Player 1 does, A1 gives us at least 20 vs 10, or 4 vs 2.

So **Player 2’s dominant strategy is A1**.

Now, what about Player 1?

Player 1’s payoffs:
- If Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Player 2 A0 → 10
  - Player 2 A1 → 2
  - So: p * 10 + (1-p) * 2 = 8p + 2 (if Player 2 plays A0 with prob p)

- If Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Player 2 A0 → 20
  - Player 2 A1 → 4
  - So: p * 20 + (1-p) * 4 = 16p + 4

Player 1 prefers A0 over A1 when:
8p + 2 > 16p + 4 → -8p > 2 → p < -0.25 → never true

So A1 gives Player 1 **strictly better** payoff than A0 for any p.

Thus, **A1 is dominant for Player 1 too**.

Wait: let's double-check.

Player 1:
- A0: gets 10 if P2 plays A0, 2 if P2 plays A1
- A1: gets 20 if P2 plays A0, 4 if P2 plays A1

So if P2 plays A0, P1 prefers A1 (20 > 10)

If P2 plays A1, P1 prefers A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 dominates A0 for Player 1 as well**.

So **(A1, A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium.

At (A1, A1): both get 4 points.

But is that good?

Compare to:
- (A0, A0): (10,10) — better for both.
- (A1, A0): (20, 0) — good for us, bad for opponent.
- (A0, A1): (2,6) — bad for us.

So (A1,A1) is **Pareto inefficient** — both can do better by cooperating.

But since both have dominant strategies to play A1, **they end up at (4,4)**.

So the **problem** is a **prisoners’ dilemma-like** structure:
- Mutual cooperation (A0, A0) is best for both (10,10)
- But unilateral deviation (A1, A0) gives you 20, but opponent gets 0 → so you'd want to deviate
- But if both do A1, both get only 4.

So the **equilibrium is inefficient**.

Now — the **mediator** can help us **escape** this inefficiency.

If both players delegate to a mediator, and the mediator plays A0 for both, then they get (10,10) — much better than (4,4).

So we want to **design a mediator that encourages cooperation** — play A0 when both delegate.

But will the other player want to delegate?

Let’s suppose **we** want the mediator to play A0 when 2 players delegate.

But what if only one delegates?

We need to define the mediator's behavior for 1 and 2 delegators.

Also, note: if both delegate, and mediator plays A0, both get 10 — great.

But suppose only **we** delegate. Then mediator plays A0 for us.

Then we (Player 2) play A0, and Player 1 plays independently.

Now, Player 1’s dominant strategy is A1.

So if we play A0, Player 1 plays A1 → we get 2, Player 1 gets 6.

But if **we** had played A1, we get 4.

So playing A0 when only we delegate → we get only 2, worse than 4.

So if we delegate **alone**, we get only 2 — which is worse than playing A1 ourselves (which gives at least 4 on average).

So **we would never want to delegate alone** — because then the mediator plays A0 for us, and we get only 2.

Similarly, suppose **only Player 1** delegates.

Then the mediator plays an action (say A0 or A1) for Player 1.

If the mediator plays A0 for Player 1, then Player 1 plays A0, and we (Player 2) can play A1 (dominant), so we get 20, Player 1 gets 0.

That’s great for **us**, bad for Player 1.

But if the mediator plays **A1** for Player 1, then (A1, A1) → (4,4)

Now, Player 1 would prefer A0 (gives 10 if we play A0, but we won't — we prefer A1).

But if Player 1 delegates, and the mediator plays A0, then Player 1 gets 0 (since we play A1), so that’s bad.

So if only Player 1 delegates, they would only want the mediator to play A0 **if they think we will play A0** — but we won’t.

We always want to play A1.

So **if only Player 1 delegates**, the worst outcome for them is if the mediator plays A0 (they get 0), better if the mediator plays A1 (they get 4).

So **the best the mediator can do for Player 1** (if they delegate alone) is to play A1 — giving them 4, which is better than 0.

So **if only Player 1 delegates**, we want the mediator to play A1 for them.

Similarly, if only **we** delegate, and the mediator plays A0 for us → we get 2 (bad).

If the mediator plays A1 for us → we get 4 (better).

So for **us**, if we delegate alone, we prefer the mediator to play A1.

So to **maximize our own payoff when delegating alone**, we want the mediator to play A1 for us.

But we also want to **get cooperation when both delegate** — so ideally, when both delegate, mediator plays A0.

So let's sketch a possible mediator:

```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```

That is:
- If 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1 for them.
- If 2 players delegate: mediator plays A0 for both.

Let’s evaluate:

#### Case 1: Only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 for Player 1.
- Player 1: A1
- Player 2: we play A1 (dominant) → outcome: (A1,A1): (4,4)
- So Player 1 gets 4 → better than 0 if mediator had played A0.
- We get 4 → same as independent.

So fair.

#### Case 2: Only Player 2 (us) delegates → mediator plays A1 for us.
- We: A1
- Player 1: A1 → (4,4)
- We get 4 → same as playing A1 ourselves.

So we're indifferent.

#### Case 3: Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → (A0,A0): (10,10)
→ Both get 10 → better than (4,4)!

So this is **a Pareto improvement**.

Now, **would both players want to approve this mediator?**

- From **our perspective** (Player 2):
  - If both delegate: we get 10 > 4 → better
  - If only we delegate: we get 4 — same as independent → no cost
  - If only opponent delegates: we get 4 — same as before
  - So **we are at least as well off**, and better when we both delegate.

  So we **want to approve this mediator**.

- From **the other player’s perspective** (Player 1):
  - If only they delegate: mediator plays A1 for them → they get 4 (same as independent) → acceptable
  - If only we delegate: they play A1 → we play A1 → (4,4) → same as independent → okay
  - If both delegate: they get 10 → much better than 4

  So they **also prefer** this mediator.

Therefore, both players **would want to approve this mediator**.

Moreover, if **only one** approves, the mediator still wins if it has more approvals.

But since both prefer it, they will **both approve** it.

Thus, **our mediator is likely to win** in the approval voting.

Now, is there a better one?

Suppose instead:
```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```
Then:
- If only one player delegates → mediator plays A0 for them.
- If only Player 1 delegates → they play A0 → we play A1 → we get 20, they get 0 → Player 1 gets 0, which is worse than 4 → they **would hate this** → they **won’t approve**.
- So unlikely to win.

Other variation:
```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A1"}
```
Then:
- If both delegate → both play A1 → (4,4) → worse than (10,10)
- But both players get 4, same as independent → so no gain → why delegate?
- So both players have **no incentive to delegate** — but we wanted to induce cooperation.

Thus, this mediator **fails** to provide a benefit for both.

So our earlier choice:
```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```
is better.

But can we do better?

Suppose we try:
```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```
As above — bad for the other player if they delegate alone.

Or:
```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A1"}
```
— no benefit.

What if we do:
```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```
→ this is what we proposed.

Wait — is it possible to make it even better?

Suppose we try:
```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```
Same as before.

But can we make the one-delegator case better?

No — because in the one-delegator case, the mediator cannot know who is delegating.

The mediator only observes **how many** delegate, not **who**.

So if only one delegates, it doesn't matter if it's us or them — the mediator treats them symmetrically.

So for **1 delegate**, the action must be the same regardless of who it is.

Thus, we must choose one action for the 1-delegate case.

We could choose A0?

But then:
- If Player 1 delegates alone → gets 0 (since we play A1) → so they get 0, worse than 4 → they won’t approve.

So A0 for 1 delegate is bad for Player 1.

If we choose A1 for 1 delegate:
- If Player 1 delegates → they get 4 → good (same as independent)
- If we delegate → we get 4 → good (same as independent)
- Both get more if both delegate (10 each)

So this is **the best possible**.

Is there a way to get more than 10? No — (A0,A0) is best, so we can’t do better.

Could we play A0 for 1 delegate only if the other player is us? No — the mediator doesn’t know who delegated.

Hence, we must commit to one action for 1 delegate.

So **A1 is the only action** that doesn’t hurt the single delegatee.

Thus, **{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"} is optimal**.

---

### **Final Decision**

We design a mediator that:
- If one player delegates: plays A1 for them.
- If both delegate: plays A0 for both.

This leads to:
- Good outcome for both in joint delegation (10,10)
- No worse than independent play in any other case
- Both players are better off (or equal) in all cases
- Hence, both will approve it
- It is likely to win

Therefore, we propose:

```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Game Structure

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 10, Other gets 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20, Other gets 0  
- (A0, A1): I get 2, Other gets 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4, Other gets 4

## Step 2: Identify the Nash Equilibrium

For me: A1 dominates A0 (20 > 10 when other plays A0; 4 > 2 when other plays A1)
For Player 1: Against my A1, they prefer A1 (4 > 0)

**Nash Equilibrium: (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4)**

But (A0, A0) gives (10, 10) - much better! This is a classic coordination problem.

## Step 3: Design Mediator to Enable Cooperation

The mediator should:
1. **When 2 players delegate**: Play A0 to achieve the cooperative outcome (10, 10)
2. **When 1 player delegates**: Protect the delegating player from exploitation

If the mediator plays A0 when only 1 delegates, that player gets exploited:
- If I delegate alone and play A0: Other plays A1 → I get only 2
- If Other delegates alone and plays A0: I play A1 → I get 20 (tempting!)

This creates a prisoner's dilemma in delegation - neither would want to delegate.

**Solution**: When 1 player delegates, play A1
- This gives both players 4 points (same as non-delegation Nash)
- No exploitation risk
- Removes the temptation to free-ride

## Step 4: Verify Incentives

With mediator {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}:

**If other player delegates:**
- I delegate: Both delegate → (A0, A0) → I get 10
- I don't: One delegates → Other gets A1, I respond with A1 → I get 4
- **Conclusion: I should delegate (10 > 4)**

**If I delegate:**
- Other delegates: Both delegate → (A0, A0) → Other gets 10
- Other doesn't: One delegates → I get A1, Other responds with A1 → Other gets 4
- **Conclusion: Other should delegate (10 > 4)**

**Mutual delegation is a Nash equilibrium achieving the optimal (10, 10)!**

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be a mediator for this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A mediator is an entity that plays actions on behalf of delegating players.
- Each player may choose to delegate their move to the mediator or act independently.
- The mediator observes the number of players delegating to the mediator and then plays the same action for all delegating players.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a mediator. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Output Format:

Let's break this down step by step to design the optimal mediator strategy.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediator)**

We have a 2-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (for Player 1, you) is:

| Your Action \ Other Player | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                     | 10       | 0        |
| **A1**                     | 6        | 4        |

And the other player’s payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A0,A1): 20
- (A1,A0): 2
- (A1,A1): 4

So the **other player** strongly prefers A1 when you play A0 (gets 20), but gets only 2 when they play A1 and you play A0.

This is a classic coordination game with a *conflict* of interest: both players prefer mutual A0 (10 each), but the other player is tempted to deviate to A1 to exploit you.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

- Each player can choose to:
  - **Act independently**, or
  - **Delegate** their action to a **mediator**.
- A mediator observes **how many players delegate** (1 or 2), then plays a **single action** (A0 or A1) for **all delegating players**.
- Only **one mediator** will be used in the final game, decided by **approval voting**:
  - You propose a mediator.
  - The other player proposes a mediator.
  - Both propose a strategy (a map from number of delegators to action).
  - You and the other player **approve** one or more mediators.
  - The **winner** is **uniformly at random** from the ones with **maximum approvals**.

Your goal: **maximize your expected points**.

---

### **Step 3: Key Insight – You Control Your Own Proposal**

You are designing **your own** mediator. You want it to be **selected**, and when selected, **maximize your expected payoff**.

But the other player also designs a mediator — and you’ll both vote.

To maximize your chance of success, your mediator should:
- Be **strategic**: give good outcomes in likely scenarios.
- Be **appealing**: encourage the other player to approve it (maybe they benefit too).
- Be **robust**: work well even if only you delegate or both do.

---

### **Step 4: Consider Possible Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: You delegate, other player acts independently**
- You are using your mediator.
- Other player chooses A0 or A1 arbitrarily.
- Your mediator chooses some action (say, A0 or A1) depending on 1 delegator.
- You want your mediator to do well **in this case**, especially if the other player is likely to pick A1 (since they prefer A1 when you do A0).

#### **Scenario 2: Both delegate**
- Both players use the mediator.
- Mediator knows 2 delegators → plays same action for both.
- So the outcome will be (A0, A0) or (A1, A1), depending on mediators' choice.

#### **Scenario 3: You act independently, other delegates**
- Other player uses *their* mediator.
- You choose A0 or A1.
- You want to **avoid** this scenario if their mediator is dangerous.

But **you don’t know** their mediator — so your design must be robust.

---

### **Step 5: Key Strategy – Design a Mediator that Encourages Coordination**

The best outcome for you is (A0, A0): 10 points.

But if you choose A0 and they choose A1, you get 0 — bad.

So you want **everyone to coordinate** on A0.

But the other player has an incentive to choose A1 if you choose A0 — they get 20, you get 0.

So they will **not** cooperate unless incentivized.

But **if you commit** to A0 via a mediator, and they commit to A0 via their mediator, then both get 10.

But they might try to exploit you.

So instead, consider a **mediator that coordinates both players on A0 only if you both delegate** — but that’s risky if only one delegates.

---

### **Step 6: Use the Mediator to Create a “Commitment” Device**

Let’s design a mediator that:
- If **only you** delegate (1 delegator), it plays **A1**.
- If **both** delegate (2 delegators), it plays **A0**.

Why?

- **Why A1 when only you delegate?**
  - If only you delegate, and your mediator plays A1, then your action is A1.
  - The other player is acting independently — if they play A0, you get 6.
    - They are more likely to play A1 (because otherwise they get 20 if you play A0, but you’re playing A1).
  - But if they play A1, you get 4.
  - So you get **at least 4** in worst case.
  - If the other player plays A0, you get 6.
  - So you get decent payoff.

But what if they play A0 and you play A1? You get 6.

What if they play A1? You get 4.

But suppose instead you played A0 — then if they play A1, you get 0.

So by playing A1 when only you delegate, **you avoid exploitation**.

- **Why A0 when both delegate?**
  - Then both play A0 → you get 10.
  - That’s the best possible outcome.
  - This gives you a **strong incentive to both delegate**.

Now: **Do you want to both delegate?**

Yes — if you delegate, and they delegate, you get 10.

If you delegate and they don’t, you get at least 4.

If you don’t delegate and they do, you might get less.

But what if **they** design a mediator?

Suppose they propose:
- 1 delegator → A1
- 2 delegators → A1

Then if both delegate, you get 4.

Not good.

Or:
- 1 delegator → A0
- 2 delegators → A0

Then if both delegate, you get 10.

But if only they delegate, they get A0, and you playing independently — if you play A1, they get 2 → bad for them? Not necessarily.

But let’s think about **approval voting**.

Suppose you propose:
> {“1”: “A1”, “2”: “A0”}

Is this likely to be approved?

- **By you**: Yes — because if both delegate, you get 10. If only you delegate, you get at least 4, avoiding 0.
- **By the other player**: Will they approve it?

Let’s see.

Suppose they are thinking: “I will delegate. What happens?”

- If only they delegate → their mediator plays A1 (since delegator = 1) → they play A1.
  - You act independently.
  - If you play A0, they get 20 (great).
  - If you play A1, they get 4.
  - But they don’t know what you will do.

But suppose they expect you to act rationally.

If they delegate, they play A1.

But then you might play A1 too — in which case you both get 4.

But if they play A1, you will likely play A1 as well to avoid getting 0 if they play A1 and you play A0.

But you are not cooperating — so expected payoff might be low.

Alternatively, suppose **they don’t delegate**.

You delegate → your mediator plays A1.

Then you play A1.

They can play A0 → you get 6, they get 2.

Or play A1 → you both get 4.

They prefer A0 (get 2), but only if you play A1.

But if they play A0, and you play A1 → you get 6, they get 2.

So they get more if they play A0.

But if they don’t delegate, their action is free.

So if you delegate, and you play A1, they can safely play A0 and get 2.

Now, suppose they can choose whether to delegate.

If they do **not delegate** and you delegate → you play A1, they can play A0 → they get 2.

If they **do delegate** → their mediator plays A1 → they play A1 → you play A1 → you both get 4.

So they get **2 vs 4** — so they prefer to **delegate** in this case? 4 > 2.

Wait: if they **delegate**, they play A1, you play A1 → they get 4.

If they **don’t delegate**, and play A0, you play A1 → they get 2.

So yes, they get more by **delegating**.

But that’s not good for them? No — they get 4 > 2.

So they prefer to delegate.

Now consider: what if **both** delegate?

Then your mediator plays A0.

So both play A0 → you get 10, they get 10.

That’s **better** than 4.

So if they delegate and you delegate → they get 10.

If they delegate and you don’t → they get 4.

So they **prefer to delegate if you delegate**, and if only they delegate, they get 4.

But from above, they prefer to delegate in all cases?

Wait — what if you **don’t** delegate?

Then they must decide whether to delegate.

- If they delegate: their mediator plays A1 (since 1 delegator), so they play A1.
- You act independently — suppose you play A0 (you might), so they get 20.

So they get 20.

If they don’t delegate, they can play A0 and you get 0 → they get 10.

But they want to maximize **their own payoff**, so they prefer getting 20 over 10.

So: if **you do not delegate**, they prefer to **delegate** and get 20 (if you play A0).

So in **all cases**, they **prefer to delegate**?

- If you delegate: they get 10 (if both delegate) vs 4 (if only they delegate) → prefer both delegate → so they will delegate.
- If you don’t delegate: they get 20 (if they delegate and you play A0) vs 10 (if they don’t delegate and you play A0) → still prefer to delegate to get 20.

But wait — what if you play A1?

Suppose you play A1 independently.

Then:
- If they delegate → they play A1 → both A1 → they get 4.
- If they don’t delegate → they can play A1 → get 4 anyway.
- Or play A0 → get 2.

So they will play A1 → get 4.

So if you play A1, and they delegate → they get 4.

If they don’t delegate → they can choose — they’ll pick A1 → get 4.

So same payoff.

But they get 20 **only if you play A0**.

But they don’t know what you will do.

Now, back to your mediator.

You propose:
> {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

Now, what do they see?

- If you **delegate**, you play A1 (when only one).
- Then they can choose to delegate → play A1 → both A1 → they get 4.
- Or not delegate → play A0 → you play A1 → they get 2.
- Or play A1 → get 4.

So to maximize their payoff, if you delegate, they prefer to **not delegate** and play A1 → still get 4.

But if they **do** delegate, they play A1 → get 4.

Same as not delegating.

But if **both** delegate → you play A0, they play A0 → get 10.

So they get more if you delegate and **they** delegate.

But right now, **you** are delegating → you play A1.

They are not (yet) delegating.

So if **they** delegate now, they play A1 → you play A1 → both A1 → they get 4.

If they **don’t**, they play A1 → you play A1 → same.

So no incentive to delegate.

But they get 10 **only if both delegate** → but currently, you are playing A1 (because only one delegate), so they can't jump to case 2 unless they commit.

So **they have no incentive to delegate** when you are delegating.

But if they **could** make you delegate to get 10, but they can't control you.

Now, suppose **they** instead consider your mediator.

They see:
- If I delegate and **you do not**, I play A1 (since 1 delegator), you play independently.
- If you play A0 → I get 20 → great.
- If you play A1 → I get 4.
- But if **I do not delegate**, and you don't, I can choose.

But they prefer to **delegate** **only if** you play A0.

But they don’t know.

However, they see that if **both** delegate, payoffs are 10,10.

So if they think you’ll delegate, they get 10.

But currently you are **only** delegating if you think it helps.

But in your strategy, you **will** delegate — because then:
- If they also delegate → you get 10.
- If they don’t → you get at least 4.

And you avoid the risk of getting 0.

So **you will always delegate**.

Then they face: you delegate → your mediator plays A1.

Now, they can:
- Delegate: play A1 → both A1 → they get 4.
- Not delegate: play A0 → you play A1 → they get 2.
- Or play A1 → get 4.

So best is to play A1 → get 4.

But they get 4.

But suppose they had a different mediator.

Suppose they propose:
> {"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}

Then:
- If you don’t delegate, and they delegate → they play A0.
  - If you play A0 → they get 10.
  - If you play A1 → they get 2.
- So they get 10 if you play A0, 2 if you play A1.

But they prefer you to play A0.

But if they delegate, they can’t observe you.

Now, you are **not** delegating → you choose A0 or A1.

They want you to play A0.

But if they delegate, they play A0 — so if you play A0 → they get 10.

But if they don’t delegate, they can play A0 → same.

But if they delegate, and you play A1, they get 2.

So **same payoff as not delegating**, unless you play A0.

So no benefit.

But now, **you** (Player 1) are designing your mediator.

You want **both to delegate**, so you both play A0 → you get 10.

But if **only you delegate**, your mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 4 or 6 depending on other.

But if **only they delegate**, your mediator doesn’t help — you’re independent.

So your mediator only helps **if both delegate**.

But the problem is: **they have no incentive to delegate if only they delegate**, because playing A0 (if they can) is better.

But in your proposed mediator, if only they delegate, your mediator doesn’t play anything — you play independently.

So they play A1 (you don’t delegate) → you might play A0 → they get 20.

So they always prefer to delegate **if you don’t** — because they get 20 if you play A0.

But they can get only 4 if they delegate and you play A1.

But expected payoff depends on your action.

Now, back to **approval voting**.

Suppose you propose:
> {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

Then:
- You will approve it — because if both delegate, you get 10.
- You’ll delegate.

Now, what does the other player think?

They consider:
- If I **approve** your mediator:
  - If I delegate and you do (both delegate), then both play A0 → I get 10.
  - If I delegate and you don’t, I play A1 → you play independently.
    - If you play A0 → I get 20.
    - If you play A1 → I get 4.
  - If I don’t delegate, I can play A0 or A1.

But they want to maximize their **own** payoff.

But in the **approval voting**, they are choosing **which mediator to approve**.

Suppose they also design a mediator.

But you control your proposal.

Let’s say the other player proposes:
> {"1": "A0", "2": "A1"}

Then:
- If only they delegate → they play A0.
- If both delegate → both play A1 → they get 4.

Not great.

Or: {"1": "A0", "2": "A0"} → then both get 10 if both delegate.

But that’s nice for you — but not for them if you play A1.

But if **you** propose {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}, and **they** propose something else, will they **approve your mediator**?

They will only approve it if it provides them a **better or equal** expected payoff.

But they get:
- If both delegate → 10.
- If only they delegate → they play A1 → you play independently.

Suppose they think you will play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1-p.

Then expected payoff if they delegate and you don’t: 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4.

If they don’t delegate, they can play A0 → get 10 if you play A0, 2 if you play A1 → 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2.

Or play A1 → get 4 if you play A0, 4 if you play A1 → 4.

So their best is max(8p+2, 4) = 8p+2 if p > 0.25, else 4.

Compare to delegating: 16p+4.

Is 16p+4 > 8p+2? Yes, always (since 8p+2 > 0).

So **they always prefer to delegate** if you don't delegate.

But if they delegate, they play A1 (in your mediator’s rule), so they get 16p+4.

But if **both delegate**, they get 10.

Now: will they **approve** your mediator?

Because if your mediator wins, then:
- If both delegate: they get 10.
- If only they delegate: they get 16p+4.

But they don’t know p.

But since they have no control over you, and they can get 16p+4 by delegating, and 10 only if you delegate.

Now: **will they delegate?**

If you delegate → your mediator plays A1 → you play A1.

Then if they delegate → play A1 → both A1 → they get 4.

If they don’t delegate → play A1 → get 4.

So same.

No benefit.

But if you don’t delegate, they get 16p+4 by delegating.

But they can get 10 only if you delegate.

But you are **not** in a position to benefit from giving them 10 unless they approve your mediator.

But they don’t know if you’ll delegate.

Do they have any **incentive to approve your mediator**?

Yes, potentially: because if **both approve** your mediator, and you both delegate, you both get 10.

But if they don’t approve your mediator, and their own wins (say, they propose {"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}), then if both delegate, they also get 10.

So **same payoff**.

But in your case, if your mediator is used, and they delegate, they get 10 only if you do too.

But you will delegate **only if you believe the mediator is good** — and you do, because it gives you 10 if both delegate.

So you will **delegate**.

Then, if they **don’t** delegate, you play A1, they play A1 → they get 4.

But if they **do** delegate, they play A1, you play A1 → they get 4.

Same.

So they can't gain from delegating — unless they coordinate.

But they can’t.

So their **only path to 10** is **if you delegate and they delegate**, which requires **both** to delegate, and **your mediator must be selected**.

But if **your mediator is selected**, then if they delegate, they get 4 or 10.

But they have to risk getting 4.

But they get 10 only if you delegate.

But you are already delegating.

So if they delegate, they get 4 (because you play A1).

So they get 4.

But if they **don’t**, they still get 4.

So no gain.

But if **you had proposed a mediator that plays A0 when only one delegates**, then:

- If you delegate → play A0.
- Then if they don’t delegate → they can play A0 → you get 10, they get 10.
- Or play A1 → you get 0, they get 20.

So they might play A1 → get 20.

Then you get 0.

Very bad.

So you **don’t** want to play A0 when only one delegates.

So back to: you propose {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

Then:
- You delegate → you play A1.
- They can delegate → play A1 → both A1 → you get 4, they get 4.
- Or not delegate → you play A1 → they can play A0 → get 2, or play A1 → get 4.

So they prefer to play A1 → get 4.

So they get 4.

But if **their own mediator** would be selected, and they use it, they might get more.

But suppose they propose a mediator that plays A1 when 1 delegate, and A1 when 2 delegates.

Then you get 4, they get 4.

Same.

Or if they propose A0 when 1, A1 when 2 — when double, they get 4.

Still.

But suppose they **always** get at least 4.

Now, **they have no incentive to approve your mediator**, because if you delegate, they get 4 anyway, and they can’t do better.

But if they **approve your mediator**, and you delegate, they get 4.

If they don't approve it, they might get 4 from their own.

But what if they **can get more** if you delegate and they don't?

If you delegate and they don't, they get 20 if you play A0.

But you are playing A1.

So they can’t.

So no.

But here's the key: **you want both to delegate** to get 10.

But you have no way to **force them to delegate**.

But you can design your mediator to **make delegation beneficial for them only if both delegate**.

Wait.

Alternative idea:

### **Propose a mediator that plays A0 only if 2 delegate, A1 otherwise**

You want both to delegate.

But what if you propose:
> {"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}

Now:
- If only you delegate → you play A0.
- If other plays A1 → you get 0 → bad.

So you avoid that.

So this is **dangerous**.

But suppose you propose:
> {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

And you delegate.

Then you play A1.

Now, **if they delegate**, they play A1 → both A1 → they get 4.
If they don't, they play A1 → get 4.

But if they **don’t delegate**, and you play A1, they can play A1 → get 4.

But they could play A0 → get 2.

So they play A1.

So they get 4.

Now, what if they had a mediator that plays A1 when 1 delegate?

Then same.

But if they **had** a mediator that plays A0 when 1 delegate, and you play A0, they could get 20.

But you are playing A1.

So they can't get 20.

So they can only get 4.

So your mediator is not worse.

But the key is: **you want them to approve your mediator**.

But they get the same payoff whether you have it or not.

But if your mediator is selected, and both delegate, they get 10.

But only if you delegate.

But you are not going to delegate unless you believe it helps.

But you believe it helps — because if both delegate, you get 10.

And if only you delegate, you get at least 4.

But if only they delegate, your mediator doesn't help.

But in your design, when only you delegate, you play A1.

So you avoid the risk of 0.

So you will delegate.

Now, the other player: if they approve your mediator, they know that if both delegate, they get 10.

But if they delegate and you don't, they get 20 if you play A0, but you play A1, so they get 4.

So they get 4.

But if they **don't** approve your mediator, and their own wins, and they use a mediator that plays A0 when 1 delegate, then if you don't delegate, they play A0.

Then if you play A0, they get 10; if you play A1, they get 2.

But they don't know.

But the **only way** they get more than 4 is if you play A0.

But you are playing A1.

So they get only 4.

So no difference.

But here's a thought: **you are the one who delegates**, so your mediator is active only if you delegate.

So you can **guarantee** that if both delegate, both play A0.

Only if both delegate.

But you need them to believe that you will delegate, and then they will delegate.

But they have no incentive to delegate when you are delegating, because they get 4 either way.

So they might not delegate.

But if they don't delegate, you are playing A1.

So your mediator might not be chosen, and they might play A1.

But you get 4.

So you get 4.

But if both delegate, you get 10.

So you want both to delegate.

But you can't force it.

Unless your mediator **rewards them for delegating when you do**.

But in this case, when only you delegate, they get 4 by delegating or not.

No difference.

So perhaps a better idea:

### **Respond to the other player's actions**

But you can't observe their action.

But you can design a mediator that **only plays A0 when 2 delegate** — that's still what we have.

But let's try a different strategy.

### **Proposal: If 1 delegate, play A0; if 2, play A0**

Then if you delegate, you play A0.

Then if they play A1, you get 0.

So you risk 0.

Bad.

So not good.

Or: if 1 delegate, play a mixed strategy?

But the mediator must play a **pure action**.

No mixed strategies allowed.

Only A0 or A1.

So the only choice is to pick one.

So back to:

### **Final decision**

We need a mediator that:
- Makes you want to delegate (so you avoid risk of 0).
- Makes the other player want to delegate (to get better payoff than not delegating).

But when only you delegate, you play A1, which is safe.

When both delegate, you both play A0 — good.

But the other player, when only they delegate, they get 20 if you play A0, but you are playing A1, so they get 4.

But if you were to play A0, they could get 20.

But you are not.

So they have no incentive to delegate.

However, **when both delegate**, they get 10.

Otherwise, they get 4.

So if they think you will delegate, and they delegate, they get 10 > 4.

So they **have an incentive to delegate** if they think you will delegate.

And you will delegate, because your mediator gives you 10 if both unite, or at least 4 otherwise.

So if they approve your mediator, and believe you'll delegate, they can get 10 by delegating.

Otherwise, if they don't delegate, they get only 4.

So they **prefer to delegate**.

And since they gain 10 > 4, they have a strong incentive to approve your mediator.

But only if they expect you to delegate.

But you will delegate anyway.

So yes.

So if your mediator is selected, and both delegate, they get 10.

If only they delegate, they get 4.

So they get 10 if they delegate and you delegate.

And since you delegate, they get 10.

Otherwise, if they don't delegate, they get 4.

So they have a strong incentive to delegate.

Therefore, they will approve your mediator because it allows them to get 10 when both delegate.

And they can't get more than 10.

So they will approve it.

And you approve it.

So it wins.

Then both delegate.

Then both play A0 → you get 10.

Perfect.

Now, what if the other player proposes a mediator that also says {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}?

Then it's the same.

So tie.

But still, you get 10.

So you are fine.

Therefore, this mediator is optimal.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
Both proposed mediators have exactly the same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for the delegator.
- If both players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

So, from my perspective, there is no strategic difference between selecting M1 vs M2. Approving both cannot make the chosen mediator worse than approving only one, because whichever wins implements the same mapping from “number of delegators” to actions.

Therefore I approve both.

Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) have exactly the same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for the delegator.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for each delegator.

Since they are behaviorally identical, there’s no strategic advantage to preferring one over the other at the mediator-selection stage. Approving both keeps the selected mediator identical in effect and avoids accidentally excluding the only available option if the other player approves differently.

response:
To decide which mediators to approve, let's analyze the effect each proposed mediator would have on the game outcomes. The goal is to maximize your expected points. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:

### Mediator Proposed by Player 1:

#### If 1 player delegates:
- Mediator will play action A1.
- Outcome possibilities:
  - You (A1), Other Player (A0) -> You get 20 points, Other Player gets 0 points.
  - You (A1), Other Player (A1) -> You get 4 points, Other Player gets 4 points.

#### If 2 players delegate:
- Mediator will play action A0.
- Outcome:
  - Both play A0 -> You get 10 points, Other Player gets 10 points.

### Mediator Proposed by Player 2:

#### If 1 player delegates:
- Mediator will play action A0.
- Outcome possibilities:
  - You (A0), Other Player (A0) -> You get 10 points, Other Player gets 10 points.
  - You (A0), Other Player (A1) -> You get 2 points, Other Player gets 6 points.

#### If 2 players delegate:
- Mediator will play action A0.
- Outcome:
  - Both play A0 -> You get 10 points, Other Player gets 10 points.

### Analysis of Outcomes:
- **Player 1's Mediator:**
  - If both players delegate, you get 10 points. If only you delegate, you could get 20 points (if other plays A0) or 4 points (if other plays A1). If other player delegates alone, you may get 2 or 10 points depending on your choice.
- **Player 2's Mediator:**
  - Always plays A0, safe but predictable: if both delegate, you get 10 points. If only you delegate, you get 10 points, and if only other player delegates, you may get 2 points if you chose A0, or you could go A1 for higher risk/reward.

### Conclusion:
Approving Player 2's mediator ensures predictability and safety, aligning with mutual cooperation scenarios usually seen in game theory (similar to a form of iterated prisoner's dilemma where players might aim for consistent cooperation). Player 1's mediator introduces more variability and potential for higher individual gain if one delegates and the other doesn't, but also risk of lower scores.

### Decision:
Approve Player 2’s mediator for more predictable outcomes and the potential stability in mutual agreement.

response:
The game's standard Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), where Player 1 receives 4 points and Player 2 receives 4 points. This is because Player 2 has a dominant strategy (A1), and Player 1’s best response to A1 is A1.

The proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical. Their strategy is:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0 for both players.

Let's evaluate the delegation game with such a mediator:
1. **If both players delegate**: The final actions are (A0, A0), and both players receive 10 points. 
2. **If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not**: The mediator plays A1 for Player 1. Player 2, knowing Player 1's action is A1, will play their best response, which is A1. This results in the action pair (A1, A1) and payoffs of (4, 4).
3. **If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 does not**: The mediator plays A1 for Player 2. Player 1, knowing Player 2's action is A1, will play their best response, which is A1. This results in the action pair (A1, A1) and payoffs of (4, 4).
4. **If neither player delegates**: The game proceeds normally, leading to the Nash Equilibrium (A1, A1) with payoffs of (4, 4).

The delegation game results in a new Nash Equilibrium: (Delegate, Delegate). In this scenario, both players receive 10 points, which is the maximum possible payoff for Player 1 and a significantly better outcome than the independent play result. Since both proposed mediators allow for this improved outcome and are identical in their functions, there is no reason not to approve both of them.

response:
To find the optimal decision for Player 1, we first analyze the base game and then evaluate the impact of the proposed mediators.

### Base Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for the base game (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- **(A0, A0):** (10, 10)
- **(A0, A1):** (0, 20)
- **(A1, A0):** (6, 2)
- **(A1, A1):** (4, 4)

**Nash Equilibrium:**
- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1's best response (BR) is A0 (10 > 6).
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1's BR is A1 (4 > 0).
- If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2's BR is A1 (20 > 10).
- If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2's BR is A1 (4 > 2).
Since Player 2 has a dominant strategy (A1), the unique Nash Equilibrium for the base game is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### Mediator Analysis
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A1.
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0.

We check the subgame perfect equilibrium if this mediator is selected:
1. **If both players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both. Payoff: **(10, 10)**.
2. **If only Player 1 delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for P1. Player 2, acting independently, will choose A1 to maximize their own points (4 vs 2). Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
3. **If only Player 2 delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for P2. Player 1, acting independently, will choose A1 to maximize their own points (4 vs 0). Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
4. **If neither delegates:** The game returns to the base Nash Equilibrium. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.

### Conclusion
Delegating becomes a weakly dominant strategy for both players. If both players are rational and the mediator is available, they will both delegate to achieve the payoff of (10, 10). This is significantly better than the standard equilibrium of (4, 4). 

Since both mediators M1 and M2 facilitate the cooperative outcome (10, 10) and are identical, Player 1 should approve both to maximize the chance of one of them being selected.

response:
The game presents a situation where the standard Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), leading to a payoff of (4, 4). This is because Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2), and Player 1's best response to A1 is A1 (4 > 0).

The proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical and offer a mechanism to reach the cooperative (10, 10) outcome:
1.  **If both players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both, resulting in a payoff of (10, 10).
2.  **If only one player delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for that player. If the other player is rational, তারা will also choose A1 (since Player 1: 4 > 0, Player 2: 4 > 2), resulting in (4, 4).
3.  **If no one delegates:** The players play independently, likely reaching the Nash Equilibrium of (A1, A1), resulting in (4, 4).

By approving these mediators, Player 1 creates an opportunity to move from a payoff of 4 to a payoff of 10, without any added risk. If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not, the mediator plays A1, protecting Player 1 from the (0, 20) outcome that would occur if Player 1 played A0 while Player 2 played A1.

Since both M1 and M2 are identical and provide this beneficial delegation option, Player 1 should approve both.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Reviewing the game and the potential mediators:

1.  **Analyze the Payoff Matrix (P2's Perspective):**
    *   (P1: A0, P2: A0) = (10, 10)
    *   (P1: A0, P2: A1) = (0, 20)
    *   (P1: A1, P2: A0) = (6, 2)
    *   (P1: A1, P2: A1) = (4, 4)
    *   In the standard game, A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2 (it yields more points regardless of Player 1's action: 20 > 10 and 4 > 2).
    *   Knowing Player 2 will play A1, Player 1 will choose A1 (4 > 0).
    *   The Nash Equilibrium for independent play is (A1, A1), resulting in 4 points for Player 2.

2.  **Evaluate the Mediators:**
    *   **Mediator 1 (M1):** 1 delegate plays A1, 2 delegates play A0.
    *   **Mediator 2 (M2):** 1 delegate plays A1, 2 delegates play A0.
    *   Both mediators are identical. If both players delegate (D, D), the mediator plays A0 for both, leading to (A0, A0), which gives Player 2 **10 points**.
    *   If only one player delegates and the other acts independently, the mediator plays A1 for the delegator. Given the dominant strategy and payoff structure, the outcome will likely settle at (A1, A1), giving Player 2 **4 points**.
    *   The delegation game creates a new equilibrium at (D, D), which is Pareto-superior to the independent play equilibrium (10 points vs. 4 points).

3.  **Conclusion:**
    Both mediators (essentially the same design) offer a mechanism for both players to coordinate on (A0, A0), significantly increasing Player 2's payoff from 4 points to 10 points. There is no disadvantage to approving these mediators.

To maximize points in the given game, we first analyze the original payoff matrix for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2):

*   (A0, A0): (10, 10)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 20)
*   (A1, A0): (6, 2)
*   (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Independence Analysis:**
In the independent game, P2 has a dominant strategy: A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing P2 will play A1, P1's best response is to play A1 (4 > 0). This leads to a Nash Equilibrium of (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

**Mediator Analysis (M1 and M2):**
Both mediators (M1 and M2) proposed are identical:
- If 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0 for both players.

If a mediator is chosen, a new "Delegation Stage" occurs:
1.  **Both Delegate (D, D):** Both play A0 (via mediator). Payoff: (10, 10).
2.  **P1 Delegates, P2 Independent (D, I):** Mediator plays A1 for P1. P2 chooses between A0 (payoff 6, 2) and A1 (payoff 4, 4). P2 will choose A1. Payoff: (4, 4).
3.  **P1 Independent, P2 Delegates (I, D):** Mediator plays A1 for P2. P1 chooses between A0 (payoff 0, 20) and A1 (payoff 4, 4). P1 will choose A1. Payoff: (4, 4).
4.  **Neither Delegate (I, I):** Returns to the Nash Equilibrium of the independence game. Payoff: (4, 4).

**Strategic Decision:**
If either M1 or M2 is active, the delegation game has a Nash equilibrium at (D, D). Since P1's payoff at (D, D) is 10 and the payoff without a mediator is 4, both mediators are highly beneficial for Player 1. There is no downside to approving mediators that create a Pareto-superior equilibrium for both parties.

Since both M1 and M2 are identical and lead to an improved outcome for Player 1, Player 1 should approve both.

response:
To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, let’s first analyze the base game’s payoffs and Nash equilibrium.

### Base Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy. Regardless of whether Player 1 chooses A0 (P2 gets 20 vs 10) or A1 (P2 gets 4 vs 2), Player 2 is always better off choosing A1. Knowing this, Player 1's best response to A1 is A1 (getting 4 instead of 0). Thus, the Nash Equilibrium of the base game is (A1, A1) with a payoff of **(4, 4)**.

### Mediator Analysis
Two identical mediators have been proposed (M1 and M2). Their rules are:
- If 1 player delegates: The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If 2 players delegate: The mediator plays A0 for both players.

If a mediator is selected, the "Delegation Game" payoffs would be:
1.  **Both Delegate (D, D):** Both play A0 (the 2-player rule). Payoff: **(10, 10)**.
2.  **Only Player 1 Delegates (D, I):** Player 1 plays A1 (the 1-player rule). Player 2, acting independently, will choose A1 to get 4 points instead of 2. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
3.  **Only Player 2 Delegates (I, D):** Player 2 plays A1. Player 1, acting independently, will choose A1 to get 4 points instead of 0. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.
4.  **Neither Delegates (I, I):** The game reverts to the base Nash Equilibrium. Payoff: **(4, 4)**.

In this delegation game, both players delegating (D, D) is a Nash Equilibrium that yields (10, 10). This is significantly better than the base game result of (4, 4).

### Decision
Both M1 and M2 use the same logic to protect players from being exploited while providing a mechanism to reach the mutually beneficial (10, 10) outcome. By playing A1 if only one person delegates, the mediator ensures that the delegating player cannot be easily exploited (getting at least 4 points). By playing A0 if both delegate, it facilitates cooperation.

Since both mediators are identical and both lead to a better outcome than the base game, Player 1 should approve both.

response:
First, ignore delegation and look at the base game:

- If the other player plays **A0**, your payoffs are:  
  - Play **A0** → 10  
  - Play **A1** → 20  (better)
- If the other player plays **A1**, your payoffs are:  
  - Play **A0** → 2  
  - Play **A1** → 4  (better)

So **A1 strictly dominates A0** in the original game.

Now include **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**. The mediator’s rule is:

- If **only 1** player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for the delegator.
- If **2** players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

Compare **delegating (A2)** to playing **A1** directly, for every possibility of what the other player does:

1. **Other does not delegate** (plays A0 or A1 independently):  
   If you delegate, you are the only delegator, so the mediator plays **A1** for you.  
   That gives you exactly the same payoff as if you had played **A1** yourself.

2. **Other delegates**:  
   - If you **don’t** delegate and play A1, the other is the only delegator → they play A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → you get **4**.  
   - If you **do** delegate too, then 2 players delegate → both play A0 → outcome (A0, A0) → you get **10**.

So **A2 is never worse than A1, and sometimes strictly better** (when the other also delegates). Therefore the optimal choice is to delegate with probability 1.

The mediator designs are analyzed to see if they can help reach the cooperative outcome $(A0, A0)$, which yields 10 points for each player, instead of the Nash equilibrium $(A1, A1)$, which yields only 4 points each.

1.  **Analysis of Mediator 1 (M1):**
    *   If both delegate: Both play $A0$, payoff (10, 10).
    *   If one delegates: The mediator plays $A1$ for that player. The other player, acting independently, will also choose $A1$ as their best response. Payoff (4, 4).
    *   If none delegate: Both play independently, resulting in the $(A1, A1)$ equilibrium, payoff (4, 4).
    *   Outcome: $(Delegate, Delegate)$ is a Nash equilibrium leading to (10, 10). Defecting from delegation leads only to a lower payoff (4).

2.  **Analysis of Mediator 2 (M2):**
    *   If both delegate: Both play $A0$, payoff (10, 10).
    *   If only Player 1 delegates: Player 1 is $A0$; Player 2 will play $A1$ independently to get 20 points, leaving Player 1 with 0.
    *   If only Player 2 delegates: Player 2 is $A0$; Player 1 will play $A0$ independently to get 10. Payoff (10, 10).
    *   If none delegate: Payoff (4, 4).
    *   Outcome: If M2 is chosen, Player 1 should not delegate. Knowing this, Player 2 will delegate to move the payoff from (4, 4) to (10, 10). Thus, M2 also leads to the (10, 10) outcome.

Since both mediators provide a pathway for Player 1 to achieve the maximum possible points (10), both are approved.

response:
The decision-making process involves evaluating the payoff matrix, finding the base Nash equilibrium, and then assessing how the proposed mediators change the expected outcome.

1.  **Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
    *   (A0, A0): 10, 10
    *   (A0, A1): 0, 20
    *   (A1, A0): 6, 2
    *   (A1, A1): 4, 4
    *   Note: As Player 2, your payoffs are the second numbers.

2.  **Base Game Analysis:**
    *   If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 prefers A1 (20 > 10).
    *   If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 prefers A1 (4 > 2).
    *   If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 prefers A0 (10 > 6).
    *   If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 prefers A1 (4 > 0).
    *   The only pure Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), yielding 4 points for each player.

3.  **Mediator Analysis:**
    *   Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical.
    *   If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0 for both, resulting in an outcome of (A0, A0) with payoffs (10, 10).
    *   If only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1 for that player.
        *   If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 does not, the mediator plays A1 for Player 2. To maximize their points against A1, Player 1 would play A1, leading to (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4).
        *   If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not, the mediator plays A1 for Player 1. To maximize their points against A1, Player 2 would play A1, leading to (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4).
    *   Stability: If one player delegates, the other player faces an outcome of 4 if they act independently or 10 if they delegate. Thus, (Delegate, Delegate) becomes a Nash equilibrium in the delegation game, providing 10 points to each player.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    The outcome of (10, 10) facilitated by either mediator is strictly better for both players than the base game Nash equilibrium (4, 4). Since M1 and M2 are identical and both lead to this superior outcome, Player 2 should approve both.

response:
To approach this problem, we need to analyze the potential outcomes and determine a strategy that maximizes our expected points. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Possible Outcomes without Delegation:**
    - If both players choose A0: (10, 10)
    - If Player 1 (other player) chooses A0 and Player 2 (you) chooses A1: (0, 20)
    - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: (6, 2)
    - If both players choose A1: (4, 4)

2. **Identify Outcomes with Delegation (A2):**
    - If one player delegates, the mediator will play A0.
    - If both players delegate, the mediator will still play A0.
   
   Since the mediator always chooses A0 regardless of the number of delegators:
    - If both delegate: (10, 10)
    - If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 chooses A0: (10, 10)
    - If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 chooses A1: (0, 20)
    - If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 chooses A0: (10, 10)
    - If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 chooses A1: (6, 2)
   
### Key Observations:
- Delegating guarantees at least 10 points if both delegate or if the opponent chooses A0 and we delegate.
- Choosing A1 directly allows for either a high payoff (20 points) if the opponent chose A0, or a mild payoff (4 points) if the opponent chose A1.
  
### Strategy Formulation:
To maximize our expected points, we should devise a probability strategy that balances between delegating (A2) and directly choosing actions A0 or A1, given their respective payoffs and the probability of the opponent's likely decisions.

### Optimal Probability Distribution:
1. **High Probability to Delegate (A2)**: Ensures a safe and moderate guaranteed payoff since mediators don’t change decision based on voting.
2. **Moderate Probability to Choose A1**: Represents the gambler's risk for seeking the highest possible payoff (20 points).
3. **Low Probability to Choose A0**: Used to mix things up and potentially catch an opponent who might choose A1.

Based on the above analysis, we can start with a higher inclination towards A2 and balance A0 and A1.

Here is a proposed probability distribution:
- Delegating to the mediator (A2) takes 60% probability.
- Choosing A1 directly takes 30% probability.
- Choosing A0 directly takes 10% probability.

```json
{
  "A0": 10,
  "A1": 30,
  "A2": 60
}
```

This distribution leverages safe points through delegation while keeping some potential for higher points through independent choices. 

We do this on the assumption that the opponent might have similar inclinations and could potentially balance their strategy as well.

response:
To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, let's analyze the payoff matrix and the impact of the mediator.

### 1. Base Game Analysis
The base game without the mediator has two actions: A0 (Cooperate) and A1 (Defect).
*   **(A0, A0):** (10, 10)
*   **(A0, A1):** (0, 20)
*   **(A1, A0):** (6, 2)
*   **(A1, A1):** (4, 4)

In this base game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy. Regardless of Player 1's action (A0 or A1), Player 2 receives more points by playing A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1's best response to A1 is to play A1 (4 > 0). This results in a Nash Equilibrium of (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

### 2. Adding the Mediator (Action A2)
The mediator introduces a commitment mechanism:
*   If only **one player** delegates (A2), they are assigned action **A1**.
*   If **both players** delegate (A2), they are both assigned action **A0**.

Let's look at the expanded payoff matrix including A2:
*   **(A2, A0):** Mediator plays A1 for P1 → (A1, A0) = (6, 2)
*   **(A2, A1):** Mediator plays A1 for P1 → (A1, A1) = (4, 4)
*   **(A0, A2):** Mediator plays A1 for P2 → (A0, A1) = (0, 20)
*   **(A1, A2):** Mediator plays A1 for P2 → (A1, A1) = (4, 4)
*   **(A2, A2):** Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) = (10, 10)

### 3. Strategy Comparison
*   **A2 vs A1:**
    *   If P2 plays A0: A2 gives 6, A1 gives 6.
    *   If P2 plays A1: A2 gives 4, A1 gives 4.
    *   If P2 plays A2: A2 gives 10, A1 gives 4.
    A2 is weakly dominant over A1. It offers the same protection as the "safe" action A1 while allowing for a much higher payoff if the other player also chooses A2.
*   **A2 vs A0:**
    *   If P2 plays A0: A2 gives 6, A0 gives 10.
    *   If P2 plays A1: A2 gives 4, A0 gives 0.
    *   If P2 plays A2: A2 gives 10, A0 gives 0.
    A0 is highly risky because if P2 plays A1 or A2, Player 1 receives 0. Since A1 and A2 are both better for P2 than A0, it is highly likely P2 will avoid A0.

### 4. Conclusion
The delegation action (A2) serves as a coordination device. Because it is weakly dominant over A1 and enables the Pareto-optimal outcome (10, 10) when both players use it, rational players seeking to maximize their points will prefer A2. By delegating, both players can safely reach the (10, 10) payoff without the risk associated with simply choosing A0.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Understanding the Base Game

Let me first understand my payoffs as Player 2:

**My payoff matrix:**
- If I play A0, other plays A0: I get **10**
- If I play A0, other plays A1: I get **2**
- If I play A1, other plays A0: I get **20**  
- If I play A1, other plays A1: I get **4**

**Strategic analysis:**
- If the other player plays A0: I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If the other player plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 2)
- **A1 is my dominant strategy**

For Player 1:
- If I play A0: Player 1 prefers A0 (10 > 0)
- If I play A1: Player 1 prefers A1 (6 > 4)

**Nash Equilibrium without mediator:** Both play A1, getting **(4, 4)**

### Analyzing the Mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

### Possible Outcomes with Mediator

**Case 1: Both delegate**
- Mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)** ✓ Much better!

**Case 2: Only I delegate**
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- Player 1 best responds to my A1 with A1
- Result: **(4, 4)**

**Case 3: Only Player 1 delegates**
- Mediator plays A1 for Player 1
- I best respond to their A1 with A1
- Result: **(4, 4)**

**Case 4: Neither delegates**
- Base game Nash equilibrium: **(4, 4)**

### Strategic Assessment

The delegation game becomes:
```
                    Player 1 delegates    Player 1 doesn't
I delegate               (10, 10)              (4, 4)
I don't delegate         (4, 4)                (4, 4)
```

- Delegating when the other delegates: **10 points** (best outcome!)
- Delegating when the other doesn't: **4 points** (no worse than base game)
- **(Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium**

### Conclusion

Both mediators enable coordination on the superior **(10, 10)** outcome, escaping the inefficient Nash equilibrium. Since:
1. Both mediators are identical
2. Having either mediator available strictly benefits me
3. Approving both maximizes the chance a mediator is selected

I should approve both mediators.

response:
Delegating (A2) is always at least as good as playing A1 directly, and sometimes strictly better:

- If the other player **doesn’t** delegate, then you are the only delegator, so the mediator plays **A1** for you. That gives you the **same payoff** you would have gotten by choosing A1 yourself (20 vs A0, 4 vs A1).
- If the other player **does** delegate, then both players delegated, so the mediator plays **A0** for both, giving you **10**, which is strictly better than choosing A1 against their delegation (which would give you 4).

So **A2 strictly dominates A1 and A0**, making it optimal to delegate with probability 1.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
To maximize points, let's analyze the game by evaluating the payoff matrix for all possible actions, including delegating to the mediator (A2). 

The mixer behaves as follows:
- **If only Player 1 delegates (A2):** Mediator plays **A1** for Player 1.
- **If only Player 2 delegates (A2):** Mediator plays **A1** for Player 2.
- **If both delegate (A2, A2):** Mediator plays **A0** for both.

### Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2)
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 | P2: A2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) | (0, 20) |
| **P1: A1** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (4, 4) |
| **P1: A2** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (10, 10) |

### Analysis
1.  **Dominance:** For Player 1, **A2** weakly dominates **A1**. 
    - If P2 plays A0: A2 (6) = A1 (6)
    - If P2 plays A1: A2 (4) = A1 (4)
    - If P2 plays A2: A2 (10) > A1 (4)
2.  **Risk Assessment:** **A0** is highly risky for Player 1. If Player 2 plays A1 or A2, Player 1 receives 0 points. For A0 to be a better choice than A2, Player 1 would need to be over 50% certain that Player 2 will play A0 ($10P_0 > 6P_0 + 4P_1 + 10P_2$).
3.  **Player 2's Strategy:** From Player 2's perspective, **A2** is a weakly dominant strategy ($20 \ge 20$, $4 \ge 4$, $10 > 2$). A rational Player 2 is almost certain to choose A2 (or A1), making A0 a very poor choice for Player 1.
4.  **Nash Equilibrium:** The outcome (A2, A2) is a Nash Equilibrium. If both players delegate, they both receive 10 points. Neither player has an incentive to deviate:
    - If Player 1 switches to A0, they get 0.
    - If Player 1 switches to A1, they get 4.
    
The mediator was proposed by you (Player 1); utilizing it to reach the maximum payoff of 10 points while protecting yourself with the fallback of action A1 (if only you delegate) is the optimal strategy.

response:
To maximize the total points received in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix for Player 2 (myself) and Player 1 (the other player) across all actions, including the delegation option (A2).

### Payoff Matrix Analysis
Let $A0$ and $A1$ be the basic actions and $A2$ be the action to "Delegate to Mediator."
Based on the mediator's rules:
- If both players delegate ($A2, A2$), the mediator plays $A0$ for both: Payoff $(10, 10)$.
- If only Player 2 delegates ($P1, A2$), the mediator plays $A1$ for Player 2:
    - If $P1$ plays $A0$, the result is $(A0, A1)$: Payoff $(0, 20)$.
    - If $P1$ plays $A1$, the result is $(A1, A1)$: Payoff $(4, 4)$.
- If only Player 1 delegates ($A2, P2$), the mediator plays $A1$ for Player 1:
    - If $P2$ plays $A0$, the result is $(A1, A0)$: Payoff $(6, 2)$.
    - If $P2$ plays $A1$, the result is $(A1, A1)$: Payoff $(4, 4)$.

**Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) | (0, 20) |
| **A1** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (4, 4) |
| **A2** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (10, 10) |

### Rational Decision Making
1.  **Dominance for Player 2:**
    - Comparing $A0$ and $A2$: $A2$ yields $20, 4, 10$ while $A0$ yields $10, 2, 2$. Action $A2$ strictly dominates $A0$.
    - Comparing $A1$ and $A2$: $A2$ yields $20, 4, 10$ while $A1$ yields $20, 4, 4$. Action $A2$ weakly dominates $A1$. It is strictly better if Player 1 also delegates ($A2$).

2.  **Dominance for Player 1:**
    - Comparing $A1$ and $A2$: $A2$ yields $6, 4, 10$ while $A1$ yields $6, 4, 4$. Action $A2$ strictly dominates $A1$.
    - Comparing $A0$ and $A2$: If Player 2 follows their dominant strategy ($A2$ or $A1$), Player 1 receives $0$ from $A0$ but $4$ or $10$ from $A2$. Thus, $A2$ is superior to $A0$ effectively.

### Conclusion
Both players have a clear incentive to delegate to the mediator ($A2$). For Player 2, $A2$ is a weakly dominant strategy that becomes strictly dominant if Player 1 is also rational and chooses to delegate. If both players play $A2$, the outcome is $(10, 10)$, which is significantly better than the standard Nash equilibrium of the original game $(4, 4)$.

Let's approach this step by step to evaluate which mediators are beneficial for you, Player 2.

### Understanding the Mediators:

- **Mediator proposed by Player 1:** 
  - If 1 player delegates: Plays A1
  - If 2 players delegate: Plays A0

- **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
  - If 1 player delegates: Plays A0
  - If 2 players delegate: Plays A0

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **Scenario Analysis for Player 1's Mediator:**
   
   **Case 1: Only You Delegate to the Mediator (1 player delegates)** 
   - The mediator will play A1.
   - If Player 1 plays A0, you get 20 points, and Player 1 gets 0 points.
   - If Player 1 plays A1, you get 4 points, and Player 1 gets 4 points.
   
   **Case 2: Both Players Delegate (2 players delegate)**
   - The mediator will play A0.
   - Both players get 10 points.

2. **Scenario Analysis for Your (Player 2's) Mediator:**
   
   **Case 1: Only You Delegate to the Mediator (1 player delegates)**
   - The mediator will play A0.
   - If Player 1 plays A0, you get 10 points, and Player 1 gets 10 points.
   - If Player 1 plays A1, you get 2 points, and Player 1 gets 6 points.

   **Case 2: Both Players Delegate (2 players delegate)**
   - The mediator will play A0.
   - Both players get 10 points.

### Strategy Evaluation:

- `Mediator proposed by Player 1`:
  - If only you delegate, the mediator will play A1, which has unpredictable outcomes depending on Player 1’s choice.
  - If both delegate, it’s beneficial (simultaneous choice of A0 for 10 points each).

- `Mediator proposed by Player 2`:
  - If only you delegate, the mediator will always play A0, which is more predictable and stable.
  - If both delegate, it’s beneficial (simultaneous choice of A0 for 10 points each).

### Making a Decision:

- Considering stability and predictability, **Player 2’s mediator** (M2) ensures that even if only you delegate, you are guaranteed decent points, and if both delegate, you both get 10 points.
- Player 1’s mediator (M1) introduces variability and lower minimum guaranteed points depending on Player 1’s independent action.

### Conclusion:

You should **approve your (Player 2’s) mediator** and **not approve Player 1’s mediator** due to the stability and predictability of outcomes, favoring your total points maximization.

### Final JSON Output:

  "M1": false,
  "M2": true

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

This is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs (for you, as Player 2) are:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 (Player 1) | A1 (Player 1) |
|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**                        | 10            | 2             |
| **A1**                        | 20            | 4             |

Note: The payoffs are **asymmetric** — you get 20 if you play A1 and opponent plays A0, but only 4 if you play A1 and opponent also plays A1.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria in the base game to understand what reasonable rational play looks like.

---

### **Step 2: Find Nash equilibria in the base game**

Let’s denote:
- You (Player 2) choose A0 with probability *p*
- Opponent (Player 1) choose A0 with probability *q*

We compute expected payoffs for each player.

#### **Your expected payoff:**
- If you play A0:  
  Payoff = *q*×10 + (1−*q*)×2 = 10q + 2 − 2q = 8q + 2
- If you play A1:  
  Payoff = *q*×20 + (1−*q*)×4 = 20q + 4 − 4q = 16q + 4

Set them equal to find indifference:
> 8q + 2 = 16q + 4  
> -8q = 2  
> q = -1/4 → not valid (probability can’t be negative)

So your best response is:
- If 8q + 2 > 16q + 4 → q < -0.25 → always true since q ≥ 0 → then you prefer A0?
Wait, that can’t be right.

Wait: Let’s recompute:

At q = 0:  
- A0: 2  
- A1: 4 → so A1 better

At q = 1:  
- A0: 10  
- A1: 20 → so A1 better

Wait a second — is A1 always better?

Wait: A1 expected payoff: 16q + 4  
A0: 8q + 2

Compare 16q + 4 vs 8q + 2  
Difference: (16q + 4) − (8q + 2) = 8q + 2 > 0 for all q ≥ 0  
→ So **A1 strictly dominates A0** for you.

→ So your best response is **always A1**, no matter what the opponent does.

Now, what about the opponent (Player 1)?

Let’s compute opponent’s payoff (as Player 1):

| Their Action \ Your Action | A0 | A1 |
|---------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                    | 10 | 6  |
| **A1**                    | 0  | 4  |

They get:
- A0: 10×*p* + 6×(1−*p*) = 10p + 6 − 6p = 4p + 6
- A1: 0×*p* + 4×(1−*p*) = 4 − 4p

Set equal:  
4p + 6 = 4 − 4p → 8p = -2 → p = -0.25 → impossible

Compare: 4p + 6 vs 4 − 4p  
Difference: (4p + 6) − (4 − 4p) = 8p + 2 → always > 0  
So A0 always better for Player 1.

→ So best response for Player 1 is always A0.

→ Therefore, **(A1, A0)** is the unique Nash equilibrium.

In that case:
- You (Player 2) play A1, get 20
- Opponent (Player 1) plays A0, gets 0

This is a **dominant strategy equilibrium**:
- For you: A1 dominates A0
- For opponent: A0 dominates A1

So **if no delegation happens**, rational play leads to (A1, A0), and you get **20 points**.

But wait — could we do better if we use delegation?

---

### **Step 3: Understand delegation and mediators**

Now, you and the opponent (Player 1) get to **approve mediators** in an **approval voting process**.

You can:
- Approve or disapprove each mediator.
- The mediator with the **most approvals** wins, selected **uniformly at random** among those tied for most.

Once selected, the mediator will play on your behalf **only if you delegate to it**.

Key point: You can **delegate** or **not delegate**.

But the **choice of mediator** is determined **before** you decide whether to delegate.

So you must decide:
1. Which mediators to approve (to increase the chance of getting a good one).
2. Whether to delegate to the selected mediator.

Important: The mediator’s behavior depends on **how many players (1 or 2)** have delegated to it.

So:
- If **only one player** delegating: mediator plays A1
- If **two players** delegating: mediator plays A0

This is true for **both mediators proposed** by Player 1 and Player 2.

Let’s recheck:

> Mediator proposed by Player 1:
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

> Mediator proposed by Player 2:
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **These two mediators are identical in behavior.**

So both mediators behave **exactly the same way**, regardless of who proposed them.

Therefore, from a **functional** standpoint, they are **indistinguishable**.

So you should approve the one(s) that are **available** and **likely to lead to higher expected payoff**.

But since they’re identical, your decision should be symmetric.

---

### **Step 4: What happens when you delegate?**

Let’s say the **selected mediator** is **M** (could be M1 or M2, doesn't matter — same behavior).

You now decide whether to **delegate** or not.

But the **number of delegations** determines the mediator’s behavior.

Possible cases:

#### **Case 1: You delegate, opponent does not**
- One player delegates → mediator plays A1 (as per design)
- You get: your action is A1, opponent’s action is their own (could be A0 or A1 — but opponent may choose based on strategy)

But **only you** delegated → so you play A1 (via mediator)
Your opponent plays **independently**, so they will play **A0** (as per dominant strategy), since A0 dominates for them.

So final outcome: (A1, A0) → you get **20 points**

So: **20 points**

#### **Case 2: Opponent delegates, you do not**
- One player delegates (opponent) → mediator plays A1
- So opponent plays A1
- You play independently → you will choose A1 (dominant strategy)
- So (A1, A1) → you get 4 points

So: **4 points**

#### **Case 3: Both delegate**
- Two players delegate → mediator plays A0
- So you play A0
- Opponent plays A0 (since they delegated to mediator, which plays A0)
- So (A0, A0) → you get 10 points

So: **10 points**

#### **Case 4: Neither delegating**
- No mediator is used
- Both play independently
- As per Nash equilibrium: (A1, A0) → you get **20 points**

So: **20 points**

---

### **Step 5: Your optimal strategy vs. whether to delegate**

You now want to **maximize your expected payoff**, but you don’t control whether the opponent delegates.

But you can affect **which mediator** is selected (via approval).

But the **mediators are identical** — so your approval decision only matters in terms of **influencing the chance of getting a good outcome**.

However, **since both mediators behave the same**, approving one over the other doesn't matter.

So let’s suppose you **approve both**.

Then, **both** have equal approval count (2), so the winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random between them — but since they’re identical, it doesn't matter.

So outcome depends only on **your decision and the opponent’s decision**.

Now, suppose you **delegate**, and **opponent also delegates** → outcome: (A0, A0), you get 10

But if you delegate and opponent doesn’t → (A1, A0), you get 20

If you **don’t delegate**, and opponent delegates → (A1, A1), you get 4

If neither delegates → (A1, A0), you get 20

So your expected payoff depends on whether you delegate and what the opponent does.

But here’s the issue: **You don’t know what the opponent will do**, and **they are also self-interested**.

But we are asked to **maximize your expected points** — so we must assume **rational, self-interested behavior** by both sides.

Now, **what is the best choice for you?**

Let’s consider your **incentives** in terms of **when to delegate**.

Suppose you believe the opponent will delegate.

Then:
- If you delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you take A0, opponent takes A0 → you get 10
- If you don’t delegate → opponent delegates → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1 → you play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4

So in this case, **you prefer to delegate** (10 > 4)

Now, suppose you believe the opponent will **not** delegate.

Then:
- If you delegate → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 20
- If you don’t delegate → both act independently → (A1, A0) → you get 20

So same payoff: 20

So if opponent doesn’t delegate, you are indifferent between delegating and not.

But now, remember: **if you delegate, it increases the chance that the mediator is used**, which could be bad if opponent also delegates.

But **both mediators are identical**, so it doesn’t matter which one is picked.

Now, let's suppose you **approve both mediators**.

Then the winning mediator is **selected at random from all approved mediators** — but since both are the same, it doesn’t matter.

So from your perspective, the only decision is whether to delegate.

But **delegation is not optional in the voting phase** — it’s a **separate decision** made after the mediator is selected.

So you must **decide now** which mediators to approve, and in the next phase, **you will decide whether to delegate or not**, based on the outcome.

But we are only being asked to **approve or disapprove mediators** now.

The question is: **Which mediators should you approve?**

Since both M1 and M2 are **identical**, approving one gives you zero extra benefit over the other.

But if you approve **only one**, then:
- The adversary (Player 1) can approve **only that one**, and thus the mediator with the most approvals (1) is selected → winner is that one.

But if you approve **both**, then:
- If Player 1 approves **both**, then both have 2 approvals → winner selected uniformly at random → 50% chance for each
- If Player 1 approves **only one**, then that one has 2 approvals, the other has 1 → so the one with 2 wins

So your decision to approve affects **the probability that a mediator is selected**, but since they are **identical**, it doesn’t matter which one is selected.

So you are **indifferent** between approving a given mediator or not — **except** in terms of **influence** over how many approve.

But here's the key: **You want to maximize the chance that you are able to get a good outcome when you delegate**.

But wait — you can **control your own delegation**.

But the **opponent can also choose** to delegate or not, and they are rational.

So we need to model **what the opponent will do**, given the approved mediators.

But we don’t know what Player 1 (the opponent) will do.

But we can assume **both are rational**, and want to maximize their own payoffs.

So let’s think about **whether the opponent would want to delegate**.

Suppose the mediator is selected (M1 or M2).

If the opponent delegates:
- If only they delegate → mediator plays A1 → they play A1
- If both delegate → mediator plays A0 → they play A0

Now, from their perspective:

If opponent delegates:
- If you do **not** delegate: opponent plays A1, you play A1 (if you don’t delegate) → (A1, A1) → they get 4
- If you **do** delegate: then both delegate → both play A0 → (A0, A0) → opponent gets 10

So if they delegate:
- Outcome depends on you.

But opponent knows that if you don’t delegate, they get 4
If you do, they get 10

But **they can’t control you**.

But they want to **maximize their own expected payoff**.

Suppose they believe **you will not delegate**.

Then:
- If they delegate → only they delegate → mediator plays A1 → they play A1, you play A1 → they get 4
- If they don’t delegate → you play A1 (dominant), they play A0 (dominant) → (A1, A0) → they get 0

So if opponent believes you won’t delegate, then:
- Delegating → get 4
- Not delegating → get 0
→ So they prefer to delegate (4 > 0)

Now, suppose they believe **you will delegate**.

Then:
- If they delegate → both delegate → both play A0 → (A0, A0) → they get 10
- If they don’t delegate → you are delegating → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, they play A0 → (A1, A0) → they get 0

So if they believe you delegate:
- Delegating → get 10
- Not delegating → get 0
→ So they prefer to delegate

So **regardless** of what they believe about you, **delegating gives them a better outcome than not delegating**.

- If you don’t delegate: delegate → 4 > 0
- If you do delegate: delegate → 10 > 0

→ So **delegating is a dominant strategy for the opponent (Player 1)**.

Therefore, **Player 1 will always delegate**.

This is crucial.

Because delegation gives them **at least 4**, while not delegating gives them **at most 0** (in best case, (A1, A0) gives them 0).

So yes, **Player 1 will delegate**.

Therefore, **no matter what you do**, **Player 1 will delegate**.

Now, what about **you**?

You must now decide whether to delegate **after** the mediator is selected.

But you know:
- Player 1 will delegate (dominant strategy)
- So **both players will delegate** → therefore, **mediator plays A0**
- So you will play A0

Thus, **you get 10 points** (because (A0, A0))

But if you **do not delegate**, and Player 1 does delegate:
- Then only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1
- So Player 1 plays A1
- You play independently → you will play A1 (dominant)
- So (A1, A1) → you get 4 points

So comparing:
- If you delegate → both delegate → (A0, A0) → you get 10
- If you don’t delegate → (A1, A1) → you get 4

→ So **you prefer to delegate**

Thus, **your best response is to delegate**.

Therefore, **if a mediator is selected and you are rational**, you will delegate.

And since Player 1 will delegate, **both will delegate**, so the mediator plays A0, you get 10.

But wait — **what if you don’t approve a mediator at all**?

Let’s consider that.

Suppose you approve **neither** mediator.

Then:
- No mediator wins (since no one has approval)
- So **no mediator is available**
- Therefore, you **must act independently**
- Opponent also acts independently

But you have already deduced that in the base game, the dominant strategy equilibrium is:
- You play A1
- Opponent plays A0
→ You get **20 points**

Compare that to when you **approve mediators** and end up delegating:

- Since both delegate → (A0, A0) → you get **10 points**

So **20 > 10**, so **you prefer not to delegate**.

But if you **approve mediators**, and **a mediator is selected**, then you will end up choosing to **delegate** (since 10 > 4), but that leads to worse payoff for you (10 < 20).

So you should **not let a mediator be selected at all**.

But the problem is: **Mediator is selected by approval voting**.

So you must approve or disapprove both.

The mediator is chosen **only if at least one person approves**.

But if **you approve no mediator**, and **Player 1 also approves no mediator**, then no mediator is selected.

But **will Player 1 approve mediators?**

Player 1 is rational and self-interested.

What will **Player 1 do?**

Let’s suppose **you approve no mediator**.

Then Player 1 can choose:
- Approve **no mediator** → no mediator selected → game proceeds without mediator → both act independently → (A1, A0) → they get 0

Or:
- Approve one (or both) mediators → then a mediator is selected.

Now, suppose Player 1 approves a mediator.

Then, since they may delegate, they will get better outcomes.

But will they be able to get a better payoff by approving?

Suppose Player 1 approves both mediators.

Then, the winning mediator is selected (say random between two identical ones).

Then, **they will delegate** (as we saw — it’s dominant for them), so both players will delegate → (A0, A0) → they get 10

Compared to **not delegating**: get 0

→ So they prefer to delegate → so if they can get a mediator, they will use it and get 10 > 0

Therefore, **Player 1 will approve at least one mediator**, to increase the chance that a mediator is available.

So if **you approve no mediator**, but Player 1 approves one or more, then a mediator **will be selected**, and then **both will delegate** → you get 10

But if you **approve a mediator**, and so does Player 1, then mediator is selected → both delegate → you get 10

But if you **approve no mediator**, and **Player 1 approves mediators**, then **adversarial selection**: mediator is selected → both delegate → you get 10

But if you **approve no mediator**, and **Player 1 also approves no mediator**, then **no mediator**, and (A1, A0) → you get 20

But Player 1 **will not approve no mediator**, because they can get 10 by approving and delegating, vs. 0 if they don’t.

So Player 1 will **always approve at least one mediator** (to get the chance of getting 10 instead of 0)

Therefore, **no matter what you do**, **a mediator will be selected**, because **Player 1 will approve at least one**.

Therefore:
- A mediator is always selected (since at least Player 1 approves one)
- Then you will delegate (because 10 > 4)
- Opponent will delegate (because 10 > 0)
→ Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 10

So if you **don’t approve**, you still end up with **10** points.

If you **approve**, same thing — mediator is selected, both delegate, you get 10.

So does it matter?

But wait — what if you **approves a mediator**, and **Player 1 does not**?

Then:
- Only you approve → mediator is selected (since you have 1, they have 0) → mediator becomes active
- Then you delegate → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Opponent does **not** delegate → so they play A0 (dominant strategy)
- So (A1, A0) → you get 20

This is **better** than 10!

So can this happen?

Yes — **only if Player 1 does not approve any mediator**

But earlier we said Player 1 will approve at least one, because:
- If they don’t approve → then no mediator → they get 0
- If they do approve → and a mediator is selected → and they delegate → they get 10 (if both delegate) or 4 (if you don’t)

But **if we suppose that you approve no mediator**, then:
- If Player 1 approves **at least one**, then mediator is selected.
- Then since they can get 10 by delegating (if you also delegate), or 4 (if you don’t), but they **can influence** — actually, they can compute.

Wait: if **Player 1 approves a mediator**, then mediator is selected.

Then, they can **decide** whether to delegate.

But if they delegate, and **you do not**, then only they delegate → mediator plays A1 → they play A1, you play A1 → (A1, A1) → they get 4

But if they **do not delegate**, and you do not, then both independently play: you play A1, they play A0 → (A1, A0) → they get 0

So if they delegate and you don’t, they get 4
If they don’t delegate, they get 0

So still better to delegate — 4 > 0

Therefore, **if a mediator is selected and they can delegate, they will**, because they get at least 4 instead of 0.

So **if a mediator is selected**, **they will delegate**, regardless.

Now, can you force a situation where **only you approve** a mediator?

Only if **Player 1 approves no mediator**.

But **Player 1 prefers to approve and get a chance to delegate**, because it gives them **at least 4** vs. **0** if no mediator.

So **Player 1 will approve at least one mediator**.

Therefore, **no matter what you do**, **at least one mediator will be approved by Player 1**.

Therefore, there will be **at least one** mediator with approval count ≥1.

Now, if you **approve a mediator**:
- Then **both** you and Player 1 approve it → at least two approvals for it
- So it **wins** (since Player 1 approves at least one, you approve at least one)

→ Mediator selected → both delegate → you get 10

If you **approve no mediator**:
- Player 1 approves at least one → so that mediator has at least 1 approval
- You have 0
- So the mediator(s) approved only by Player 1 win → one mediator selected
- Then both players will delegate (you as best response, opponent because they want to get 4 or 10)
→ Both delegate → (A0, A0) → you get 10

So in **both cases**, you end up with 10 points.

But earlier we saw that if **you approve and Player 1 doesn't**, then you could get 20.

But Player 1 **will** approve, so that case never occurs.

Therefore, **whatever you do**, **you get 10 points**, because both players delegate (due to rationality), leading to (A0, A0).

But wait — what about the case where **you approve a mediator**, but **Player 1 approves only one**, and **you approve both**?

Then:
- M1: you approve, Player 1 approves → 2 approvals
- M2: you approve only → 1 approval
→ M1 wins

Then both players can delegate → both delegate → (A0, A0) → you get 10

Same outcome.

Now, is there any way for you to **avoid** getting 10?

Only if you **don’t delegate**, but we saw:
- If you don’t delegate and opponent delegates → you get 4 → worse than 10

So you **must** delegate if a mediator is present.

And since **Player 1 will approve at least one**, **a mediator is always selected**, and **both will delegate**, so **you always get 10**

But wait — **ℤ️. Wait, yet earlier in base game without delegation, you get 20**

But by **approving mediators**, you are **forcing a situation** where you get only 10.

Therefore, **you should avoid having a mediator selected**, so that you can play independently and get 20.

But **you cannot prevent a mediator from being selected**, because **Player 1 will approve one**.

So **no matter what you do**, a mediator will be selected.

Therefore, **you are forced into the delegated game**, where you get 10.

But is there a way to **reduce the chance** of a mediator being selected?

Only if you **dissuade Player 1** from approving mediators.

But they won’t — it’s in their interest.

So **no escape**.

Wait — unless **you approve meditators in a way that makes it less likely that the game proceeds with delegation**.

But no — **if a mediator is selected**, both will delegate → you get 10.

But if **no mediator is selected**, you get 20.

So you want **no mediator selected**.

But **Player 1 will approve at least one** → so there will be a mediator with at least one approval.

So **no mediator will be selected only if no one approves any**.

But Player 1 will approve → so **at least one mediator is selected**.

Therefore, **you cannot avoid the delegated game**.

And in that game, you get 10.

But is that the best you can do?

Wait — let’s go back.

Earlier I assumed that **if a mediator is selected**, you will delegate, because 10 > 4.

But **if you delegate, you get 10**

**If you do not delegate**, you get 4

So yes, you delegate.

After that, both delegate → you get 10.

So you cannot avoid this.

But **what if you approve mediators**, but the **opponent knows you will delegate, so they don’t want to?**

But no — for Player 1, acting independently gives them at most 0.

Delegating gives them at least 4.

So they will always delegate.

Therefore, **no matter what**, both will delegate → (A0, A0) → you get 10

But this contradicts the base game, where you get 20.

So by **allowing any mediator**, you **worsen your own payoff**.

Therefore, you should **not approve any mediator**, because if you do, you get 10, but if you don’t, and only Player 1 approves, you still get 10.

But wait — if you **don’t approve**, and Player 1 does, then mediator is selected, both delegate → you get 10.

If you **do approve**, same thing.

So same outcome.

But is there a difference?

No.

But what if **you approve a mediator**, and **Player 1 approves only one**, but you approve both — then the one you approved has more approvals — but since identical, it doesn’t matter.

So no difference.

Therefore, **your approval decision does not affect the outcome** — you get 10 in any case.

But wait — **the only way to get 20 is if no mediator is selected** — i.e., no one approves any.

But Player 1 will approve at least one.

So **no way to get 20**.

Therefore, you cannot avoid getting 10.

But is there a way to get more than 10?

No — because both will delegate, forcing A0.

So 10 is the best you can do.

But perhaps you can avoid approving if Player 1 approves, and you don't , you get 10 anyway.

So your approval doesn't matter.

But the key insight is: **you should not approve any mediator**, because:
- If you approve, you might be seen as creating a choice, but it doesn't change outcome
- But if the mediator is selected, and you like it, it doesn't help
- However, **approval is about influence**, but since mediators are identical, it doesn't help

But let’s think from a different angle.

Suppose you **approve both** mediators.

Then, if Player 1 also approves both, then both have 2 approvals → winner selected at random → but doesn’t matter.

If Player 1 approves only one, then that one has 2 approvals → wins.

Either way, mediator is selected.

Same outcome.

But suppose you **approve only one**.

Then, if Player 1 approves both, then that one has 2 approvals, the other has 1 → the one you approved wins.

But you don’t care — identical.

So no gain.

But here's a critical point: **you cannot get 20**, because officer will always approve a mediator, so mediator is always selected.

So you get 10.

Therefore, **your approval has no effect on your payoff**.

But you want to **maximize your points**, and you get 10 regardless.

So any approval is as good as the other.

But perhaps you should **approve mediators** to increase the chance that a good one is selected.

But both are the same.

So you should **approve both** to have more influence, but it doesn't matter.

But the safest is to **approve both**, because then your influence is maximized.

But since it doesn't matter, you might as well approve both.

But wait — the question is to **maximize your points**.

And you get 10 in all cases.

So you can't do better.

But is there a way to get more than 10?

Only if **not both delegate**.

But we saw that:
- If you don't delegate, and opponent delegates → you get 4 < 10
- And opponent will delegate anyway

So no.

Therefore, you must get 10.

So your approval decision doesn't affect your payoff.

But the mediator is selected based on approvals.

Suppose you approve **no mediator**.

Then, if Player 1 approves one, that one wins.

If Player 1 approves no mediator, then no mediator — but Player 1 will not do that.

So a mediator is selected.

Then both delegate — you get 10.

Same if you approve some.

So no difference.

But what if you **approve only one**, and Player 1 approves only one, but a different one?

Then the one you approved has 1, the one Player 1 approved has 1 — so either can win (max approvals is 1, so random choice among those with 1 approval)

Then the winner is chosen uniformly at random.

Then both players delegate — you get 10 anyway.

So no difference.

Therefore, your approval decision has **no effect** on your payoff.

So you can approve any.

But to maximize your chance of influencing, but since outcome is the same, it doesn't matter.

But let's think: **Is there a scenario where by approving, you can prevent a mediator from being selected?**

No — if Player 1 approves, then at least one is selected.

So no.

Therefore, you are indifferent.

But the only way to get 20 is to have no mediator selected.

But that requires both players to approve no mediator.

But Player 1 will not do that.

So you cannot achieve 20.

Therefore, you get 10.

So your approval decision is irrelevant.

But you must choose.

Since the two mediators are identical, and you get the same outcome whether you approve or not, you might as well **approve both** to have maximum influence.

Or approve none.

But approing has no cost, and might help if Player 1 is not strategic, but we assume they are.

So we can approve both.

But let's consider: **if you approve no mediator, and Player 1 approves both, then they have two approvals each**, so one wins.

You get 10.

If you approve both, same thing.

So no difference.

Therefore, **you can approve any combination**.

But to maximize your chance, approve both.

But since no difference, we can approve both.

Final decision: approve both.

But wait — is there a risk?

No.

Therefore, to have the most influence, approve both.

Or to not help the system, approve none.

But since you want to maximize your points, and both options give you 10, it's fine.

But there is a possibility: if you approve only one, and Player 1 approves none, then even if you approve, but they don't, then only you have approval, so mediator is selected.

Then both delegate — you get 10.

Same.

But Player 1 will not approve none.

So no.

Thus, approve both.

But there is a simpler way: **since the mediators are identical, you should approve both**, because it doesn't hurt and gives you more say.

But in this case, it doesn't matter.

However, to avoid any risk, approve both.

But actually, there is a better insight.

Suppose you **approve no mediator**.

Then, if Player 1 approves both, then both have two approvals, so winner chosen at random.

But you get 10.

If you approve both, same thing.

So no difference.

Final decision: we can approve both.

But wait — the only thing that matters is that a mediator is selected, which is unavoidable.

So you might as well approve both to have full influence.

So I conclude: **approve both mediators**.

Even though it doesn’t change your payoff, it's the safest and maximally informed choice.

But let's double-check the original question.

> Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of.

> The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

> Mediator proposed by Player 1: M1
> Mediator proposed by Player 2: M2

Since M1 and M2 are identical in function, and you can't avoid the delegated game, and both options give you 10, you should approve both to maximize your influence.

So answer: approve both.

{"M1": true, "M2": true}

To maximize the points in this game, we should analyze the payoff matrix, including the additional "Delegate to Mediator" action (A2). We first identify the results of all combinations of actions:

1.  **(A0, A0)**: Both act independently. You get **10**, the other player gets **10**.
2.  **(A0, A1)**: Both act independently. You get **0**, the other player gets **20**.
3.  **(A1, A0)**: Both act independently. You get **6**, the other player gets **2**.
4.  **(A1, A1)**: Both act independently. You get **4**, the other player gets **4**.
5.  **(A2, A0)**: You delegate (mediator plays A1), they play A0. You get **6**, the other player gets **2**.
6.  **(A2, A1)**: You delegate (mediator plays A1), they play A1. You get **4**, the other player gets **4**.
7.  **(A0, A2)**: They delegate (mediator plays A1), you play A0. You get **0**, the other player gets **20**.
8.  **(A1, A2)**: They delegate (mediator plays A1), you play A1. You get **4**, the other player gets **4**.
9.  **(A2, A2)**: Both delegate (mediator plays A0 for both). You get **10**, the other player gets **10**.

Organizing this into a payoff matrix for Player 1:
- **A0**: [10 (if P2 plays A0), 0 (if P2 plays A1), 0 (if P2 plays A2)]
- **A1**: [6 (if P2 plays A0), 4 (if P2 plays A1), 4 (if P2 plays A2)]
- **A2**: [6 (if P2 plays A0), 4 (if P2 plays A1), 10 (if P2 plays A2)]

Analyzing the strategies:
- **A2 vs. A1**: Action A2 is identical to action A1 in all cases except when the other player also chooses A2. If both choose A2, you get 10 points; if you chose A1 instead, you would only get 4. Thus, A2 weakly dominates A1.
- **A2 vs. A0**: Action A0 only yields a high payoff (10) if the other player chooses A0. However, the other player has no rational incentive to choose A0 because they can get a higher payoff (20) by choosing A1 or A2 if they believe you are playing A0. If they anticipate you playing A2, their best response is also A2 (yielding 10) rather than A0 (yielding 2).

The pair (A2, A2) is a Nash Equilibrium and is Pareto optimal. Since the mediator was selected via approval voting, it is highly likely both players realize that delegating is the most stable way to reach the (10, 10) outcome.

response:
To maximize the total points received, we analyze the payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 by incorporating the mediator's rules as a third action, A2 (Delegate). 

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The initial payoff matrix (P1, P2) for actions A0 and A1 is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this base game, Action A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing Player 2 will likely choose A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (4 > 0). The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

### 2. Analysis of the Delegate Action (A2)
The mediator's rules are:
- If only one player delegates, that player plays A1.
- If both players delegate, both play A0.

We construct a new 3x3 payoff matrix including Action A2:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) | (0, 20) |
| **A1** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (4, 4) |
| **A2** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (10, 10) |

- **Player 2's Incentives:** Comparing A1 and A2, A2 is identical to A1 unless Player 1 also delegates (A2), in which case Player 2 receives 10 points instead of 4. Since A1 already dominates A0, A2 weakly dominates both A0 and A1 for Player 2.
- **Player 1's Incentives:** Similarly, A2 weakly dominates A1 for Player 1 (it yields the same results as A1 except if Player 2 chooses A2, where P1 gets 10 instead of 4). Comparing A2 to A0, A2 is superior unless Player 2 plays A0 with very high probability. However, Action A0 is Player 2's worst-performing move, making it unlikely for a rational Player 2 to choose it.

### 3. Equilibrium and Decision
If both players are rational, they will recognize that delegating (A2) is a weakly dominant strategy that opens the possibility of the highest cooperation payoff (10, 10). If only one player chooses A2 and the other chooses A1, they still fall back to the safety of the (4, 4) outcome.

Given that A2 offers the highest potential reward (10 points) without any additional risk compared to A1, and given that Action A0 is strategically poor for Player 2, delegating is the most robust strategy for Player 1.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To maximize the total points received in this game, we must carefully analyze the payoff structure and the role of the mediator.

1.  **Payoff Analysis:**
    The payoffs for Player 1 (you) and Player 2 are:
    *   (A0, A0): (10, 10)
    *   (A0, A1): (0, 20)
    *   (A1, A0): (6, 2)
    *   (A1, A1): (4, 4)

2.  **Evaluating the Impact of the Mediator (A2):**
    Delegating to the mediator (A2) results in the mediator playing A0 for you, regardless of how many players delegate.
    *   (A2, A0): (A0, A0) = (10, 10)
    *   (A2, A1): (A0, A1) = (0, 20)
    *   (A0, A2): (A0, A0) = (10, 10)
    *   (A1, A2): (A1, A0) = (6, 2)
    *   (A2, A2): (A0, A0) = (10, 10)

3.  **Strategic Analysis:**
    *   **Player 1:** If Player 2 plays A0 (or A2), Player 1's best response is A0 (or A2), as 10 is better than 6. If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1's best response is A1, as 4 is better than 0.
    *   **Player 2:** If Player 1 plays A0 (or A2), Player 2's best response is A1, as 20 is better than 10. If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2's best response is A1, as 4 is better than 2.

    From this, we see that **Action A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2**. Regardless of what Player 1 chooses, Player 2 always earns more points by playing A1.

4.  **Optimal Strategy for Player 1:**
    Knowing that Player 2 is a rational point-maximizer and has a dominant strategy in A1, we should expect Player 2 to play A1.
    *   If Player 1 plays A0 or A2, and Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 receives **0 points**.
    *   If Player 1 plays A1, and Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 receives **4 points**.

    While the mediator (A2) and the cooperation (A0) offer a possible 10-point payoff, this is only achievable if Player 2 acts against their own self-interest (by not choosing A1). Since the objective is to maximize your own points and Player 2 has a clear incentive to defect, playing A1 is the safest and most rational move to secure points. In a simultaneous one-shot game, the Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1).

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To maximize the total points received as Player 2, let’s analyze the payoffs for each set of actions between Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2).

### 1. Game Analysis
The provided payoffs for (P1, P2) are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### 2. Delegating to the Mediator (A2)
The mediator's rules are:
- If 1 player delegates (A2), they play action **A1**.
- If 2 players delegate (A2), they both play action **A0**.

Now, let's construct the expanded payoff matrix including action A2:
- **P2 chooses A2, P1 chooses A0**: P2 delegates alone, so P2 plays A1. Payoff: (0, 20).
- **P2 chooses A2, P1 chooses A1**: P2 delegates alone, so P2 plays A1. Payoff: (4, 4).
- **P2 chooses A2, P1 chooses A2**: Both delegate, so both play A0. Payoff: (10, 10).
- **P2 chooses A0, P1 chooses A2**: P1 delegates alone, so P1 plays A1. Payoff: (6, 2).
- **P2 chooses A1, P1 chooses A2**: P1 delegates alone, so P1 plays A1. Payoff: (4, 4).

### 3. Evaluating Player 2's Strategies
- **Action A0**: Payoffs against (A0, A1, A2) are (10, 2, 2).
- **Action A1**: Payoffs against (A0, A1, A2) are (20, 4, 4).
- **Action A2**: Payoffs against (A0, A1, A2) are (20, 4, 10).

Comparing A1 and A2 for Player 2: A2 provides the same value as A1 when P1 plays A0 or A1, but yields significantly more (10 instead of 4) if P1 also delegates (A2). 
Comparing A0 and A2: A2 strictly provides higher payoffs in every scenario (20 vs 10, 4 vs 2, 10 vs 2).
Thus, **A2 is the weakly dominant strategy for Player 2**.

### 4. Evaluating Player 1's Strategies
- **Action A0**: Payoffs (10, 0, 0).
- **Action A1**: Payoffs (6, 4, 4).
- **Action A2**: Payoffs (6, 4, 10).

For Player 1, A2 is also a weakly dominant strategy, as it provides the same payoff as A1 unless P2 also delegates, in which case it results in a much higher payoff (10 vs 0 or 4).

### 5. Final Strategy
Given that A2 is the dominant strategy for both players and leads to a Pareto optimal Nash Equilibrium (10, 10), the most logical decision is to delegate entirely to the mediator.

If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game.

Both proposed mediators have the exact same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for the delegator.
- If both players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

Since they are identical, I’m indifferent between them in terms of outcomes. Approving both cannot make me worse off (any selected mediator behaves the same), and it weakly increases the chance that an approved mediator is among the winners under approval voting.

Both proposed mediators implement the same rule:

- If exactly 1 player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for that delegating player.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both.

For Player 1, this is attractive because:
- If **both delegate**, the outcome becomes **(A0, A0)**, yielding **10** points for me (better than the (A1, A1) outcome of 4).
- If **only one delegates**, the delegator plays **A1**; the other player’s best response to A1 is also **A1**, leading to **(A1, A1)** and **4** points for me—so delegation doesn’t expose me to a worse outcome than what best-responding would produce.

Since M1 and M2 are identical and both potentially enable the high-payoff (A0, A0) when jointly delegated to, I approve both.

response:
Both proposed mediators implement the same rule: if exactly one player delegates, the delegator plays **A1**; if both delegate, both play **A0**.

- In the original game, Player 2 has a dominant action **A1**, so the likely outcome is **(A1, A1)** giving me **4**.
- With either mediator available, if **both** players delegate, the outcome becomes **(A0, A0)** giving me **10** (strictly better).
- If only one player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for that player, which doesn’t make my payoff worse than what I’d rationally do anyway (I’d choose **A1** against Player 2’s **A1**).

So having either mediator available creates upside (possible coordination on **(A0,A0)**) with no real downside. Since the two mediators are identical, I approve both.

response:
To determine which mediators to approve, let's analyze each one in detail step by step. We need to consider the potential outcomes based on whether one or both players delegate their actions to the mediator, and how that affects our potential points. Our goal is to maximize our total points.

### Analyzing Mediator Proposed by Player 1 (M1):
- **If 1 player delegates:** It plays action A1.
    - Scenario Analysis:
      - If we delegate but the other player does not (they play independently), they might predict the mediator plays A1.
      - Outcomes:
        - Other player plays A0: We (Player 2) get 20 points (best scenario).
        - Other player plays A1: We get 4 points (worse than A0).

- **If 2 players delegate:** It plays action A0.
    - Scenario Analysis:
      - If both delegate, both play A0 resulting in:
        - Both get 10 points.

### Analyzing Mediator Proposed by Player 2 (M2):
- **If 1 player delegates:** It plays action A0.
    - Scenario Analysis:
      - If we delegate but the other does not (they play independently), they still might predict this.
      - Outcomes:
        - Other player plays A0: We both get 10 points.
        - Other player plays A1: We get 2 points (worse scenario).

- **If 2 players delegate:** It plays action A0.
    - Scenario Analysis:
      - If both delegate, both play A0 resulting in:
        - Both get 10 points.

### Decision Making:
We need to maximize our points:
1. If both delegating ensures A0 for both (10 points each).
2. With M1 if we are the sole delegate and they don’t predict correctly, we can get 20 points.
3. With M2 if we delegate alone, the other player playing contingently can make us worse off (2 points).

Given that the outcome of the votes for M1 and M2 are strategically significant depending on the probability of the other player also delegating, I might lean towards approving only one of them, provided it gives us a safer and less manipulatively weak outcome.

Since:
- M1 alone delegation can, in the best case, result in 20 points if the other player misses that it delegates A1.
- Both M1 and M2 in full delegation result in 10 points each, I would approve M2 for its less risk in the situation:

```json
{
  "M1": false,
  "M2": true
}
```

response:
To solve this problem, we need to carefully strategize our decisions based on the potential moves of the other player and the existence of the mediator.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Payoff Matrix Understanding:**
   - If both players choose A0, both get 10 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 (me) chooses A1, Player 1 gets 0 and Player 2 gets 20 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 6 points and Player 2 gets 2 points.
   - If both players choose A1, both get 4 points.

2. **Game Dynamics with Mediator:**
   - If Player 2 (me) delegates to mediator (A2), mediator plays A0:
     - If Player 1 also delegates (A2), both will end up playing A0 and both get 10 points.
     - If Player 1 does not delegate and plays A0, Player 1 gets 10 points and I (Player 2) get 10 points.
     - If Player 1 does not delegate and plays A1, Player 1 gets 6 points and I (Player 2) get 2 points.

3. **Optimal Strategy Considerations:**
   - **Independent Play:**
     - Purely playing A0:
       - If Player 1 plays A0: 10 points.
       - If Player 1 plays A1: 2 points.
     - Purely playing A1:
       - If Player 1 plays A0: 20 points.
       - If Player 1 plays A1: 4 points.

   - **Delegation:**
     - Delegation leads the mediator to play A0 regardless of Player 1’s move:
       - If Player 1 delegates too: 10 points.
       - If Player 1 plays A0: 10 points.
       - If Player 1 plays A1: 2 points.

Therefore, **delegation benefits Player 2 the most when**:
   - Player 1 also delegates.
   - Player 1 plays A0.

Given the mediator always chooses A0 and understanding the incentives:
   - The strategy involves us playing A1 (because it gives highest payoff against A0 if opponent doesn't delegate) or delegating (guarantees A0). Based on mixed strategy considerations and ensuring a balance, we should mix delegation and playing A1.

**Final Mixed Strategy Decision:**
Allocating percentage probabilities to each choice:
- Delegating to Mediator (A2)
- Independent play with A1

Considering minimal direct play with A0 can immediately lead Player 2 to lower expected points considering the payoff, especially since the mediator plays A0 and secure baseline.

**Here’s the final calculated mixed strategy in the required JSON format:**

```json
{
  "A0": 10,
  "A1": 40,
  "A2": 50
}
```

This distribution aims to balance potential options and maximize the expected payoff effectively given the mediator’s consistent strategy and understanding opponent’s potential moves.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:

- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are Player 2 in a two-player game. The payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Points | Opponent's Points |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 10          | 10                |
| A0          | A1                | 2           | 6                 |
| A1          | A0                | 20          | 0                 |
| A1          | A1                | 4           | 4                 |

This is a classic coordination/defection game, similar to a modified prisoner’s dilemma.

But note: **Player 1 is the one who proposed the mediator**, and we're told that we are **Player 2**.

We’re allowed to **delegate** our action to a mediator via a new action: A2 = "Delegate to Mediator".

So our three actions are:
- A0: Play A0 with certainty.
- A1: Play A1 with certainty.
- A2: Delegate to the mediator.

The mediator behaves depending on **how many players delegate**:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**.
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**.

So if:
- You delegate, and Player 1 does not → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1.
- Both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0.

Note: The mediator is **not** strategic in the sense of maximizing your payoff—it's a fixed rule based on number of delegates.

Also: Since **Player 1 proposed the mediator**, we assume Player 1 might be strategic in choosing whether to delegate or not.

But **you** must decide your own strategy **in expectation**, knowing that:
- Your choice of A0, A1, or A2 affects your payoff and also affects whether the mediator acts as A1 or A0 (depending on delegation count).
- Player 1 will also choose *their* strategy based on their incentives.

---

### **Step 2: Identify the Strategic Environment**

This is now a **two-player game with a delegation option**, and **Player 1 also has a choice**.

Player 1’s options:
- A0 (play A0)
- A1 (play A1)
- A2 (delegate to mediator)

We are Player 2. We must choose a mixed strategy: probabilities over A0, A1, A2, such that our expected payoff is maximized, **anticipating that Player 1 will also be choosing optimally**.

But we aren’t told Player 1’s incentives — however, we assume **both players are rational and self-interested**.

So we must find a **Nash equilibrium** of this extended game.

Let’s denote:
- Our strategy: (p0, p1, p2) where p0 = P(choose A0), p1 = P(choose A1), p2 = P(choose A2), with p0 + p1 + p2 = 100.

But since the mediator’s action depends on the number of delegates, we must consider joint probabilities.

Let’s consider possible combinations.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the mediator’s behavior**

The mediator’s action depends on the **number of delegates**:

| Delegates | Mediator Action |
|----------|----------------|
| 0        | (not applicable — no one delegates) |
| 1        | A1 |
| 2        | A0 |

So:
- If only **you** delegate (p2 > 0, Player 1 plays A0 or A1), then mediator plays **A1**.
- If **both** delegate, mediator plays **A0**.
- If **neither** delegates, then both play their own actions.

So the **effective strategy of Player 2** is:
- If you choose A0: you play A0
- If you choose A1: you play A1
- If you choose A2: your action becomes:
  - A1 if Player 1 does not delegate
  - A0 if Player 1 delegates

Similarly, Player 1’s effective action depends on their own choice and yours.

This creates **strategic interdependence**.

---

### **Step 4: Identify Potential Equilibria**

Let’s suppose **both players are rational** and will not play strictly dominated strategies.

Let’s analyze payoffs.

We will consider **symmetric** or **simple** strategies.

But first: **Is there a dominant strategy in the base game (without delegation)?**

Let’s check **Player 2’s incentives in base game (without delegation)**.

Payoff matrix (Player 2 rows, Player 1 columns):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0         | A1         |
|----------------------|------------|------------|
| A0                   | (10,10)    | (2,6)      |
| A1                   | (20,0)     | (4,4)      |

Let’s compute Player 2’s best response:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - A0: 10
  - A1: 20 → **A1 is better**

- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - A0: 2
  - A1: 4 → **A1 is better**

So **A1 dominates A0** for Player 2.

So in the base game, Player 2 will **always** prefer A1 over A0.

Now what about Player 1?

Payoffs for Player 1 (since the game is **not symmetric**):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0         | A1         |
|----------------------|------------|------------|
| A0                   | (10,10)    | (20,0)     |
| A1                   | (2,6)      | (4,4)      |

If Player 2 plays A0:
- A0: 10
- A1: 2 → A0 better

If Player 2 plays A1:
- A0: 20
- A1: 4 → A0 better

So **A0 dominates A1** for Player 1.

So without delegation, in the base game:
- Player 1 plays A0
- Player 2 plays A1

→ (A1, A0) → Payoff: (20, 0)

This is **not symmetric**, and Player 1 is worse off.

But now, **delegation is an option**.

Let’s explore whether **delegation** can help improve outcomes.

---

### **Step 5: Explore the Use of Delegation**

Recall:

- If only you delegate → mediator plays A1
- If both delegate → mediator plays A0

So if you delegate:
- And Player 1 **does not** delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get whatever payoff results from (your action = A1, Player 1's action = ?)

Wait — **your action is played by the mediator**, but **Player 1 acts independently**.

So if you delegate (A2), and Player 1 acts (A0 or A1), then:
- If only you delegate → mediator plays **A1**
- So the outcome is (your action: A1, Player 1’s action: ??)

So you get the payoff for (A1, Player 1’s action)

Similarly, if **both delegate**, then:
- Your action: A0 (by mediator)
- Player 1’s action: A0 (from mediator)

So outcome is (A0, A0), payoff (10, 10)

Now, let’s consider **if both players delegate**:

- You: A2
- Player 1: A2
- → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0
- So both play A0 → (A0, A0) → payoff: (10,10)

This is **mutually beneficial** compared to (A1, A0) → (20,0), but Player 2 gets only 10 instead of 20.

But Player 1 gets 10 instead of 0. So both better off?

Wait: in (A1, A0), Player 2 gets 20, Player 1 gets 0.

In (A0, A0), both get 10.

So Player 2 loses 10, Player 1 gains 10.

So is this better?

But if both can coordinate to delegate, they both get 10.

But if only **you** delegate, **Player 1 plays A0 or A1**, and **you get A1** (since mediator plays A1 if only one delegate).

So if you delegate, and Player 1 plays A0 → outcome: (A1, A0) → you get 20, Player 1 gets 0.

That’s great for you.

But if Player 1 plays A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4, Player 1 gets 4.

But Player 1 is rational — will they want to let you delegate?

Let’s suppose **you** consider delegating.

Then:
- If you delegate and Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20
- If you delegate and Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4

So your **expected payoff** depends on Player 1's strategy.

But Player 1 is also rational.

Let’s consider **Player 1’s best response**.

Suppose you **delegate**.

Then Player 1 considers:
- If Player 1 plays A0: → mediator plays A1 (since only you delegate), so outcome is (A1, A0) → Player 1 gets **0**
- If Player 1 plays A1: → mediator plays A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets **4**
- If Player 1 plays A2 (delegate): → now both delegate → mediator plays A0 → outcome (A0, A0) → Player 1 gets **10**

So Player 1’s options if you delegate:
- A0: 0 points
- A1: 4 points
- A2: 10 points

So **Player 1’s best response is to delegate**, getting 10 > 4 > 0.

So if **you delegate**, Player 1 will **also delegate** → outcome (A0, A0) → both get 10.

But if you delegate and Player 1 delegates, you **get only 10**.

But in the base Nash equilibrium (A1, A0), you get 20.

So you would prefer **not** to delegate — unless you can exploit Player 1.

But Player 1, being rational, will **not** let you get 20 — because that gives Player 1 0.

So if you try to delegate, Player 1 will **also delegate**, so you get only 10.

Hence, **delegation is not advantageous** for you if you believe Player 1 will respond rationally.

Wait — but what if you don’t delegate?

You could play A1, and if Player 1 plays A0, you get 20.

But Player 1’s best response to you playing A1 is to play A0 (because A0 gives 20 vs 4).

So in **pure strategy Nash**:
- Player 1: A0
- Player 2: A1
→ (20, 0)

That’s the only pure strategy Nash.

But is it stable? Yes.

Can Player 1 do better? Only by deviating, but if Player 1 plays A1, they get only 4 < 20.

Can Player 2 do better? If Player 2 deviates to A0, they get 2 < 20.

So this is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.

But now: suppose you **deviate to delegate**?

Then:
- You: A2
- Player 1: A0 → so only you delegate → mediator plays A1
- Outcome: (A1, A0) → you get 20, Player 1 gets 0

But **Player 1 can do better** — instead of A0, they can play A2 (delegate), then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get 10.

So if you delegate, Player 1 **prefers to delegate too**, getting 10 instead of 0.

So **Player 1 will not let you get 20** — they will **delegate**.

So if you delegate, outcome is (A0, A0) → you get 10.

Worse than 20.

So **you have no incentive to delegate**.

But wait — what if you randomize?

Could there be a **mixed strategy equilibrium** where you use A2?

Let’s suppose we consider **mixed strategies**.

But note: the outcome depends on **both players**’ strategies.

Let’s suppose that **Player 1 is rational and will choose best response**.

We are to choose a strategy for **Player 2** to **maximize our expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 is rational and will choose optimally.

Thus, we should compute **Player 2’s best response** to optimal behavior by Player 1.

But since it’s a simultaneous move game, and both are rational, we look for Nash equilibrium.

Let’s try to **find a Nash equilibrium**.

We know one equilibrium: (A1, A0) → you get 20.

But is there another?

Suppose **both players delegate**.

Then outcome: (A0, A0) → (10,10)

Can either player deviate and improve?

- You: if you deviate to A1, while Player 1 delegates → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → outcome: (A1, A0) → you get 20 > 10 → so you **would deviate**.

So **(A2, A2) is not a Nash equilibrium** — you can profitably deviate.

Similarly, if only you delegate, Player 1 will delegate, so you get 10.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and Player 1 delegates?

Then:
- Player 1: A2 → delegates → but you don’t delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so Player 1 plays A1.
- You: play A0 or A1.

So outcome:
- If you play A0: (A0, A1) → you get 2
- If you play A1: (A1, A1) → you get 4

So best for you: play A1 → get 4

But if you **don’t delegate**, and Player 1 delegates, you get 4.

If both delegate, you get 10.

But if you **defect** to not delegate when Player 1 delegates, you get only 4, less than 10.

So if Player 1 commits to delegating, you prefer to delegate too to get 10.

But if you delegate, and Player 1 is going to delegate anyway, you get 10.

But if Player 1 is going to delegate, and you don’t, you get only 4 — so you want to delegate.

So **if Player 1 delegates**, then **you want to delegate too**.

Now, what if you **don’t delegate**, and Player 1 plays A0 (not delegating)? Then:
- You play A1 → outcome (A1, A0) → you get 20

That’s very good.

But Player 1 has to consider: if you don’t delegate, and they play A0, they get 0.

But if they play A1, they get 4.

If they delegate, they get 10 (if you also delegate), or 4 (if you don’t).

So suppose **you** do **not delegate**, and play A1.

Then Player 1 can:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4
- A2: if they delegate, and you don’t, then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so Player 1 plays A1 → you play A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets 4

So best for Player 1: either A1 or A2 → both give 4, better than 0.

So they might play A1 or A2.

But if Player 1 plays A2 (delegate), and you play A1 (not delegate), then outcome is (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets 4.

But if they could get more? No.

Now, suppose **you** play A0 instead.

Then:
- If Player 1 plays A0: (A0, A0) → you get 10
- If Player 1 plays A1: (A0, A1) → you get 2
- If Player 1 delegates: mediator plays A1 → outcome (A0, A1) → you get 2

So Player 1’s best response to you playing A0 is A0 → they get 10.

But you get 10.

But you can do better by playing A1 → and getting 20 if Player 1 plays A0.

So playing A0 is bad.

So **you should never play A0**.

Thus, **p0 = 0**.

Similarly, A1 is better than A0.

So only A1 and A2 are plausible.

So strategy: (0, p, 100−p) — play A1 with prob p, delegate with prob 100−p.

Now, suppose you play A2 with probability q, A1 with (1−q).

Player 1 will best respond.

Let’s suppose Player 1 has strategies: A0, A1, A2.

We want to find a **best response** for you, assuming Player 1 will best respond to your strategy.

But this is complex.

Alternatively, let’s consider **whether there is a symmetric or cooperative equilibrium**.

Wait — earlier we saw that **if you delegate**, Player 1 will **also delegate**, because that gives them 10, better than 0 or 4.

So **if you delegate**, outcome is (A0, A0) → you get 10.

But if you play A1, and Player 1 plays A0, you get 20.

But Player 1 **won’t play A0** if they can get more by playing A1 or A2.

In particular, if you play A1, Player 1’s best response is A0? Let’s confirm.

Payoffs for Player 1 if you play A1:
- If Player 1 plays A0: gets 0
- If Player 1 plays A1: gets 4
- If Player 1 plays A2: gets 4 (since only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → both play A1 → 4)

So best is A1 or A2 → get 4, better than 0.

So **Player 1 will not play A0** if you play A1.

So **Player 1 will play A1 or A2**, not A0.

So if you play A1, Player 1 plays A1 or A2 → you get 4 in both cases.

- (A1, A1): 4 points
- (A1, A1): same

So you get **4** if you play A1.

But if you play A2 (delegate), and Player 1 plays A1 or A2:
- If Player 1 plays A1: only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → so outcome (A1, A1) → you get 4
- If Player 1 plays A2: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → outcome (A0, A0) → you get 10

So if you delegate, and Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4
If Player 1 plays A2 → you get 10

But Player 1 will play A2 only if it gives them 10 > 4 → so they **will choose A2** if you delegate.

So if you delegate, Player 1 **will delegate**, so outcome is (A0, A0), you get 10.

Therefore:

- If you play A1: Player 1 plays A1 or A2 → you get 4
- If you play A2: Player 1 plays A2 → you get 10

So **10 > 4** — so **you prefer to delegate**.

But wait — earlier we said if you play A1 and Player 1 plays A0, you get 20, but now we’re saying Player 1 won’t play A0.

Because if you play A1, Player 1 can get 4 by playing A1 or A2, but only 0 by playing A0.

So **Player 1 will not play A0**.

So **you cannot get 20**.

Similarly, if you play A0, you get at best 10 (if Player 1 plays A0), but you get 2 if they play A1.

But since you can get 10 by delegating, and 4 by playing A1, **delegation is better**.

So **best response for you is to delegate**.

But is that stable?

Suppose you delegate (A2).

Then Player 1’s best response is to **also delegate** (A2), getting 10 > 4.

So outcome: (A0, A0), both get 10.

Now, would **you** want to deviate?

If you deviate to A1, while Player 1 delegates → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4 < 10 → **you do not want to deviate**.

Similarly, if you play A0: outcome (A0, A1) if Player 1 plays A1 → you get 2 < 10 → no.

So if both delegate, and both play A2, you get 10, and cannot improve.

Similarly, Player 1 gets 10, cannot improve.

So **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Now, what about the other equilibrium (A1, A0)?

Let’s check: you play A1, Player 1 plays A0.

- You get 20
- Player 1 gets 0

But can Player 1 improve?

If Player 1 deviates to A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets 4 > 0 → yes, so **Player 1 can profitably deviate**.

So this is **not a Nash equilibrium**.

Similarly, if Player 1 plays A2: (A1, A2) → only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets 4 > 0 → better.

So **(A1, A0) is not a Nash equilibrium**.

The only Nash equilibrium is **(A2, A2)**: both delegate → (A0, A0) → (10,10)

Because:
- If you deviate to A1: you get 4 < 10
- If you deviate to A0: you get 2 or 4 < 10
- Similarly for Player 1

So **(A2, A2) is the only Nash equilibrium**.

Therefore, **your optimal strategy is to delegate with probability 100%**.

Thus, the probability distribution is:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

But wait — is there any other equilibrium?

Suppose you play A1 with some probability, but then Player 1 responds by playing A1 or A2.

But earlier analysis showed that if you play A1, Player 1 gets 4 from A1 or A2, and 0 from A0.

So Player 1 will never play A0.

So if you play A1, you get 4.

If you play A2, you get 10.

So **A2 is better**.

No mixed strategy can help — because A2 gives 10, A1 gives 4, so you should never play A1.

A0 gives less than 4.

So **pure strategy A2 is best**.

Moreover, since (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium, and you're maximizing your payoff, this is the way to go.

### **Step 6: Final Answer**

You should choose to delegate with 100% probability.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

response:
To maximize the points received, we need to analyze the strategic options, including the delegation to the mediator (A2).

1.  **Understand the Payoff Matrix for Independent Play:**
    *   (A0, A0): 10, 10
    *   (A0, A1): 0, 20
    *   (A1, A0): 6, 2
    *   (A1, A1): 4, 4

2.  **Incorporate the Mediator (A2):**
    *   If P1 chooses A2 and P2 chooses A0: Mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A0) = (6, 2).
    *   If P1 chooses A2 and P2 chooses A1: Mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A1) = (4, 4).
    *   If P1 chooses A2 and P2 chooses A2: Both play A0. Result (A0, A0) = (10, 10).
    *   Symmetrically for P2:
        *   If P2 chooses A2 and P1 chooses A0: Result (A0, A1) = (0, 20).
        *   If P2 chooses A2 and P1 chooses A1: Result (A1, A1) = (4, 4).

3.  **Expanded Payoff Matrix (P1, P2):**
    | P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) | (0, 20) |
    | **A1** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (4, 4) |
    | **A2** | (6, 2) | (4, 4) | (10, 10) |

4.  **Analyze Dominance and Strategy:**
    *   **For Player 2:**
        *   A1 strictly dominates A0 (20 > 10, 4 > 2, 4 > 2).
        *   A2 weakly dominates A1 (20 = 20, 4 = 4, 10 > 4).
        *   A rational Player 2 is most likely to choose A2.
    *   **For Player 1:**
        *   If Player 2 is expected to play A2, Player 1's best response is A2 (10 points) over A1 (4 points) or A0 (0 points).
        *   A2 weakly dominates A1 for Player 1 as well (6 = 6, 4 = 4, 10 > 4).
        *   While A0 yields 10 points if Player 2 plays A0, Player 2 is unlikely to play A0 because it is a dominated strategy for them.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    The strategy (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium that results in the highest possible payoff for both players (10, 10) while being safer than A0. As A2 weakly dominates A1 and yields a superior result to A0 given a rational opponent, delegating to the mediator is the optimal choice.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

response:
Let's break this down step by step, carefully analyzing the game, the mediator proposals, and your strategic objective: **maximizing your own total points** over the course of the game.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**
The game is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1. You are Player 2 (i.e., the second player in the payoff matrix). Let's write the payoff matrix clearly, with your choices as rows and the other player’s as columns.

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 (Player 1) | A1 (Player 1) |
|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**                        | (10, 10)      | (2, 6)        |
| **A1**                        | (20, 0)       | (4, 4)        |

So:
- If you play A0 and opponent A0 → you get 10
- If you play A1 and opponent A0 → you get 20
- If you play A0 and opponent A1 → you get 2
- If you play A1 and opponent A1 → you get 4

This is **not symmetric** between players — you benefit more from playing A1 when opponent plays A0 (20 points), but suffer if you play A1 while opponent plays A1 (only 4 points).

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Mediator System**

You now have a choice:
- Play **independently**, or
- **Delegate** your action to a **mediator**, which will choose your action based on **how many players** have delegated to it.

The mediator selection is done via **approval voting**:
- You approve or disapprove of each mediator.
- The mediator with the **most approvals** wins.
- If multiple are tied for most approvals, one is chosen **uniformly at random**.

You don't get to pick the mediator — you only approve or disapprove of the proposed mediators. The **winning mediator** will be used **if any delegation occurs**.

Note:
- **Both mediators are identical in design**, according to the description:

> Mediator proposed by Player 1:
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0
>
> Mediator proposed by Player 2:
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So both M1 and M2 have **identical behavior**.

---

### **Step 3: What Does the Mediator Do?**

Given that both mediators behave the same:
- **If only one person delegates**, the mediator plays **A1**.
- **If both players delegate**, the mediator plays **A0**.

So, the mediator is a **deterministic rule** based on total number of delegates.

Now, **if you delegate**, your action is determined by the **total number of delegation** decisions.

But here’s a key point: **You decide first** whether to delegate (via your voting decision), and then both players make their actual action (or delegation) choices. But the voting step is only about **approval** of the mediators, not about **whether to delegate**.

Wait — clarification needed.

Re-reading:  
> "You and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game."

So the **approval voting** happens **before** any delegation decisions. You are to **approve or disapprove** the mediators now.

After that, the **winning mediator** is selected. Then, **both players decide whether to delegate** or not.

But in the current prompt, you are only asked to:
> Return a valid JSON object with your approvals

So at this stage, **you are not deciding whether to delegate**, just **which mediators you approve of**, based on how likely they are to serve your interest.

---

### **Step 4: Strategic Consideration — What Do You Want?**

You want to **maximize your expected points** in the final game.

You have two paths:
1. **Act independently** (choose your own action).
2. **Delegate** to a mediator (then your move is determined by the mediator’s rule).

But you **don’t** get to choose whether to delegate now — you only choose **which mediator to approve**.

So why does it matter which mediator you approve?

Because:
- If **both mediators are approved**, and both have equal approvals, then **one is chosen at random**.
- If **only one is approved**, then that one **must win**.
- If **neither is approved**, then **no mediator is available** → players **must play independently** (no delegation possible).

Ah! That’s crucial.

So:
- Your approval choices determine **whether any mediation is possible**, and **which mediator is used if delegation occurs**.
- But since both mediators are identical in behavior, **it doesn’t matter which one wins** — **they behave identically**.

Therefore, **you cannot distinguish between M1 and M2 in terms of outcome**.

---

### **Step 5: Should You Approve Any Mediator?**

Let’s consider the scenarios:

#### **Case 1: You approve neither M1 nor M2**

Then **no mediator wins** (since there’s 0 approvals for all). So **no delegation possible** → both players **must act independently**.

You are then forced into the base game.

You can still choose your own probabilities over A0 and A1.

But you have **no control over the mediator**, so in the long term, you can only optimize your independent play.

#### **Case 2: You approve at least one of M1 or M2**

Then, assuming you approve at least one, and the other player also approves some, a mediator may be selected.

But since **both have identical behavior**, **your decision to approve M1 vs M2 doesn’t matter** — the outcome depends only on **how many people approve**, and then the **random tie-breaker**.

But **you want to maximize your payoff**.

So the key question is:
> Does having the mediator available (and possibly used) help you **get more points**, compared to not having it?

So let's ask: **Would you prefer to be able to delegate to a mediator?**

Let’s suppose you **can** delegate, and you trust the mediator to play in your interest.

But you **can’t** control what the mediator does — it depends on **how many players delegate**.

So suppose we’re in a world where **both players can delegate**, and **a mediation system exists**.

Then:
- If both delegate → mediator plays **A0**
- If only one delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If none → both play independently

Suppose you, as Player 2, want to **maximize your expected point total**.

You might consider: **Can I benefit from delegating when it's optimal?**

Let’s analyze **what your best strategy is** under delegation vs independence.

But here’s the twist: **You don’t decide whether to delegate** at this stage — you only decide which mediators to approve.

So your **approval** determines **whether mediation is possible**, but **not whether you or the other player actually delegate**.

So what should you do?

You need to **influence the outcome** in a way that **increases your expected payoff**.

But since **both mediators are identical**, **approving both or only one doesn’t affect the behavior** — only the **number of approvals** matters for the chance of mediation being available.

However, **if both players approve the same mediator**, then it wins.

But what if you approve **only one**, and the other player approves only **the other**?

Then **both mediators have 1 approval** → **tie** → **chosen uniformly at random**, so either M1 or M2 is used.

But again — **both work identically**, so the outcome is the same.

Therefore, **the only thing that matters is whether at least one mediator is approved**.

Wait — no.

Suppose **you approve neither** → then **no mediator is available** → **no delegation** → players must act independently.

Suppose you **approve at least one** → then **some mediator might be available**, depending on the other player’s actions.

But **the other player also votes** — you don’t know their preferences.

So your decision here is **strategic**.

But you want to **maximize your expected payoff**, given that the other player is also rational (and will try to maximize their own points).

Let’s consider what each player wants.

---

### **Step 6: What Do Players Want?**

You (Player 2) want to **maximize your points**.

Player 1 wants to **maximize their own points** (same logic).

Now, recall:
- If both play A0 → (10, 10)
- You play A1, Player 1 plays A0 → (20, 0) ← **good for you, bad for them**
- You play A0, Player 1 plays A1 → (2, 6) ← **bad for you, good for them**
- Both play A1 → (4, 4)

So for **Player 1**:
- Best outcome: you play A0, they play A1 → get 6
- Second best: they play A0 and you play A0 → 10
- Worst: they play A0 and you play A1 → 0

So **Player 1 hates when you play A1 and they play A0**.

For **you (Player 2)**:
- Best: you play A1, opponent A0 → 20
- Second best: both A0 → 10
- Third: both A1 → 4
- Worst: you A0, opponent A1 → 2

So you prefer **A1 when opponent plays A0**.

But if the opponent plays A1, you’d prefer they played A0.

---

### **Step 7: Strategic Implications of Mediator**

Now suppose a mediator is available, and you can **delegate**.

The mediator:
- If only one player delegates → plays A1
- If both delegate → plays A0

So the mediator **incentivizes coordination** — if both delegate, you both get A0.

But if only one delegates, they play A1 — **which is risky for you**.

Let’s suppose **you delegate**.

Then:
- If **only you delegate** → mediator plays A1 → your action is A1
- If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 → your action is A0

So your action (as a delegator) is:
- A1 if only you delegate
- A0 if both delegate

Similarly, if the other player delegates:
- They play A1 if only they delegate
- A0 if both delegate

Now, let's ask: **Should you want a mediator available?**

Let’s compare two strategies:

---

#### **Option A: No delegation possible (i.e., you disapprove both mediators)**

Then both players **must act independently**.

In this case, you can pick any mixed strategy: prob of A0 = p, A1 = 1−p.

Similarly for Player 1.

You want to maximize your expected payoff.

Let’s suppose you choose to play A1 with probability q (you pick q).

But now, you need to consider what Player 1 might do.

But we don’t know their strategy yet.

Let’s find the **Nash equilibrium** of the base game.

---

### **Step 8: Nash Equilibrium of the Base Game**

Let:
- You (Player 2) play A1 with probability q
- Player 1 play A1 with probability p

Your expected payoff:
- If Player 1 plays A0 (prob 1−p):
  - You play A0 → 10
  - You play A1 → 20
  - So your expected payoff given A0: 10×(1−q) + 20×q = 10 + 10q
- If Player 1 plays A1 (prob p):
  - You play A0 → 2
  - You play A1 → 4
  - So your expected payoff: 2×(1−q) + 4×q = 2 + 2q

Total expected payoff for you:
E = (1−p)(10 + 10q) + p(2 + 2q)  
= (1−p)(10 + 10q) + p(2 + 2q)  
= 10 + 10q − 10p − 10pq + 2p + 2pq  
= 10 + 10q + (−10p + 2p) + (−10pq + 2pq)  
= 10 + 10q − 8p − 8pq

Take derivative w.r.t. q: dE/dq = 10 − 8p

Set to 0: 10 − 8p = 0 → p = 10/8 = 1.25 — Impossible

So no interior equilibrium.

Since dE/dq = 10 − 8p > 0 if p < 1.25 (always), so derivative always >0 → you **always want q = 1** (maximize q)

So you should **always play A1**.

Now for Player 1: what do they do?

Their payoff:
- If you play A0 (prob 1−q): they get 10 if A0, 6 if A1 → so (1−q)*10 + q*6
- If you play A1 (prob q): they get 0 if A0, 4 if A1 → so q*4

So their expected payoff:
E1 = (1−q)*10 + q*6 + q*4 = 10 − 10q + 6q + 4q = 10

Wait: E1 = 10 −10q + 6q + 4q = 10 + 0q = 10

Wait — really?

Wait:
- When you play A0 (prob 1−q): if Player 1 plays A0 → 10, A1 → 6 → so expected: 10(1−q) + 6q? No — no, wait.

Player 1's choice:
- If Player 1 plays A0: gets 10 if you play A0, and 0 if you play A1 → so expected: 10(1−q) + 0*q = 10(1−q)
- If Player 1 plays A1: gets 6 if you play A0, and 4 if you play A1 → so expected: 6(1−q) + 4q

So compare:
- A0: 10(1−q)
- A1: 6(1−q) + 4q

Set equal: 10(1−q) = 6(1−q) + 4q  
→ 10 − 10q = 6 − 6q + 4q  
→ 10 − 10q = 6 − 2q  
→ 4 = 8q  
→ q = 0.5

So Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 if q = 0.5

But for q < 0.5: 10(1−q) > 6(1−q) + 4q → better to play A0

For q > 0.5: 6(1−q) + 4q > 10(1−q) → better to play A1

But you (Player 2) want to maximize your payoff.

Earlier: your expected payoff: E = (1−p)(10 + 10q) + p(2 + 2q)

But we found that dE/dq = 10 − 8p > 0 for all valid p ≤ 1 → so **you always want q = 1**.

So **best response: always play A1**

Then q = 1 → Player 1’s expected payoffs:
- A0: 10(1−1) = 0
- A1: 6(0) + 4(1) = 4

So Player 1 prefers A1 → p = 1

So NE: both play A1 → (4, 4)

You get 4.

But wait — is this really the only NE?

Try q = 1 (you play A1 always), then for Player 1, playing A1 gives 4, A0 gives 0 → so p = 1

Then both play A1 → payoff (4,4)

Now, is this a Nash equilibrium?
- You: if Player 1 plays A1, you get 4 for A1, 2 for A0 → you prefer A1 → so yes
- Player 1: if you play A1, they get 4 for A1, 0 for A0 → so yes

So (A1, A1) is a NE.

But is there another?

Suppose you always play A0 → q = 0

Then Player 1:
- A0: gets 10
- A1: gets 6
→ so prefers A0 → p = 0

Then outcome: A0,A0 → (10,10)

Now check if player 2 wants to deviate: if Player 1 plays A0, you get 10 for A0, 20 for A1 → so you want to deviate.

So not equilibrium.

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with prob p, you play q.

We saw that for you, E = 10 + 10q − 8p − 8pq

Since this increases in q, you always want q=1.

Then Player 1 must play A1 (as above).

So **only pure strategy NE is (A1, A1)**.

But is there a mixed strategy NE?

Let’s find mixed NE.

Let:
- Player 1 plays A1 with prob p
- Player 2 plays A1 with prob q

For Player 2: if Player 1 plays A0 (prob 1−p): you prefer A1 (20 > 10)
If Player 1 plays A1 (prob p): you prefer A1 (4 > 2)
So regardless of p, you prefer A1 → q = 1

Then Player 1: if you play A1 always, they get:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4
→ so play A1 → p = 1

So only mixed NE is (q=1, p=1) — and both play A1.

So **the only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1): both play A1 → 4 points each**

So **if you cannot delegate**, and must play independently, **you will get 4 points**.

But wait — could players coordinate to play A0 for higher payoff? But they can’t — Player 1 would rather play A1 when you play A0, because they get 6 vs 4.

But in (A0,A0) both get 10, which is better than (4,4). So there’s a **coordination problem**.

But in absence of communication, they get stuck at (A1,A1) — **Pareto inefficient**.

Now — **what if a mediator is available?**

Can delegation help you **avoid the bad equilibrium**?

Suppose you **can delegate**.

And a mediator is selected.

Now, suppose both players **delegates to the mediator**.

Then the mediator plays A0 (since two delegates) → so both end up playing A0 → you get 10 — **much better than 4**!

But if only one delegates, mediator plays A1 → so the delegate plays A1.

But you may not want to be the only one delegating — because then you play A1 while the other plays independently.

So you need to **coordinate** the number of delegates.

Now, consider the **incentive to delegate**.

You want to both delegate — because that leads to (A0,A0) → 10 for you.

But if you delegate and the other doesn't, you play A1, and opponent plays whatever they do.

Suppose opponent plays A0 → then you play A1 → you get 20 — good.

But opponent probably won’t play A0 — because if you play A1, they get 0.

So the only stable outcome is (A1,A1), so opponent will likely play A1.

So if you're the only delegator, you play A1 (per mediator), opponent plays A1 → (4,4) — same as independent.

But if you both delegate, you both play A0 → (10,10) — better for both.

So **both delegating is better than both not delegating**.

But can you **coordinate on delegating**?

Now, here’s the problem: **your decision to delegate depends on what the other player does**.

But you can only **approve** mediators **now**, and then later decide whether to delegate.

So if you **approve the mediator**, it becomes available → then both players can choose to delegate.

But you don't know if the other player will delegate.

But now consider: **if you approve a mediator, you enable the possibility of both delegating**, which gives you 10 instead of 4.

But if you only approve one, and the other only approves the other, then one is chosen randomly — but same behavior.

But **should you approve any mediator at all?**

Suppose you **do not approve any mediator** → no mediation → you get 4 in equilibrium.

Suppose you **approve a mediator** → then mediation is possible.

Now, if you **can coordinate** with the other player to **both delegate**, then you get 10 → better.

But if you don’t coordinate, you might both end up playing A1 → same as before.

But the **mediator system provides a mechanism to coordinate on A0**.

Now, **what if both players approve the same mediator**?

Then it’s available.

Now, both players can choose to delegate.

**Is there an incentive to delegate?**

Suppose you think the other player will delegate.

Then if you delegate, both delegate → you play A0 → you get 10.

If you **don’t delegate**, you play independently.

But what will you play? Your best response is A1 → you get 4 (if other plays A1).

But if other delegates, they play A0 — so opponent plays A0.

Then your best response is A1 → you get 20.

So if **only you don’t delegate**, and opponent delegates → opponent plays A0 → you play A1 → you get 20 → **better than 10**.

So it’s **better for you to not delegate** in this case!

Similarly, if only the other player delegates, and you don’t, and they play A0, you get 20.

So if you can **let the other player delegate and play A0**, you can **exploit** by playing A1 → get 20.

So you have **incentive to not delegate** if the other player delegates.

But if you both delegate, you get 10.

But if **you don’t delegate and the other does**, you get 20.

So **you prefer to be the non-delegator** when the other delegates.

This creates a **prisoner’s dilemma** in delegation.

So the equilibrium might be: **neither delegates** → both end up with 4.

Or: **only one delegates** → then delegate plays A1, non-delegate plays A1 → 4 again.

But if only one delegates, and they play A1 → opponent, if playing independently, might still play A1 → you get 4.

But if opponent is not delegating, they play independently — and if they think you’re playing A1, they might play A1 — but if you’re playing A1, and they play A0, they get 0 — so they won’t.

But if **only you delegate** and the other doesn’t, you play A1 (because only one delegate), other plays A1 (best response) → you get 4.

Same as before.

But if both delegate → both play A0 → both get 10.

So **both delegating is better**.

But can it happen?

Suppose you both approve the mediator.

Then, both players can choose to delegate.

Now, the **best response**:
- If opponent delegates, you get:
  - If you delegate → A0 → 10
  - If you don’t delegate → you play A1 → 20 (if opponent plays A0)
  → 20 > 10 → so you prefer not to delegate

Similarly, if opponent does **not** delegate, you get:
- If you delegate → you play A1 → if opponent plays A1 → you get 4
- If you don’t delegate → you play A1 → you get 4
  → same.

But if opponent doesn't delegate, and you do, you play A1.

If opponent plays A1, you get 4.

But if, by chance, opponent plays A0, you get 20 — but they likely won’t.

So you have no incentive to delegate if the other doesn’t.

But if the other **does** delegate, you **don’t want to**, because you can get 20 by not delegating and playing A1.

But if the other player thinks like you, **neither will delegate**.

So the **only equilibrium is no delegation**.

Thus, **even with mediation available, it may not be used**.

So you get only 4.

But if you **don’t approve any mediator**, you also get 4.

But now, consider: **what if you approve a mediator, but the other player doesn’t?**

Then the mediator has 1 approval (yours), the other has 0 → so it wins (if you approve it).

Then, mediator is active.

Now, can you delegate?

Yes.

But as above: if you delegate, you play A1 (only one delegate), opponent plays independently → they’ll play A1 → you get 4.

If you don’t delegate, you play A1 → get 4.

Same.

So still 4.

But if you **both** approve a mediator, but **only one is chosen**, then same thing.

But now — **what if you approve both mediators?**

Then, even if the other player approves only one, you have both approved.

Then the mediator with most approvals wins → if other player approves one, then that one has 1, yours have 2 → so the one(s) you approved win.

So **any mediator you approve is more likely to win**.

But since both are identical, **doesn’t matter**.

But here’s the **crucial insight**:

If you **approve at least one mediator**, then:
- If the other player approves **none**, your approved mediator wins → mediation available.
- If other player approves some, mediator wins.

But you **cannot force** the other player to approve anything.

But if you **approve neither**, then **no mediator wins**, so no delegation.

Then you play independently → you get 4.

If you **approve at least one**, then **a mediator is available**, and **there is a chance that both players delegate**, and they get 10.

But **as shown, the equilibrium is likely that no one delegates** — because you have incentive to **not delegate** if the other does.

So delegation may not happen.

But **what if you approve a mediator, and the other player is rational and sees the value of coordination**?

But since **you can exploit** by not delegating when the other does, there’s no trust.

So **no coordination is likely**.

Therefore, **the availability of the mediator does not change the outcome** — because **you still end up at (A1,A1)**.

So you get 4 in both cases.

But **what if you approve only one**, say M1?

Then M1 has 1 approval.

If the other player approves M1, then M1 has 2 → wins.

If other approves M2, then M2 has 1, M1 has 1 → tie → random choice → either M1 or M2 → both same → no difference.

So outcome is same.

But now, consider: **if both mediators are approved by you**, you increase the chance that **at least one wins**, but since you approve only one, you’re fine.

But **since both are identical, the only thing that matters is whether some mediator wins**.

And that happens **iff at least one player approves at least one**.

But if you approve **neither**, then **no mediator wins**.

So, **in order to have mediation available, you must approve at least one**.

And since mediation might allow the possibility of both delegating and getting 10, and since you get 4 otherwise, **you want mediation available**.

Even if it’s not used, you might benefit from the threat or coordination.

But as analyzed, **delegation is not stable**.

So mediation may not be used.

But **could you still benefit?**

Only if you can **make the other player believe** that if they delegate, you will too — but you can’t.

Alternatively, suppose you approve **both mediators**, and the other player approves only one.

Then the mediated system **is active**.

But still, no incentive to delegate.

So payoff remains 4.

But what if you **do not approve any**, and the other player does?

Then the other player’s approved mediator wins.

Then mediation is active.

Now, you can still choose to delegate or not.

But you still have incentive to **not delegate** — because then you can exploit.

So you’ll still not delegate.

So you get 4.

So in all cases, you get 4.

But wait — **what if the other player approves a mediator, and you don't**?

Then mediator exists.

You can choose to delegate or not.

If you delegate, you play A1 (only one delegate), other plays A0 (because they delegated) → you play A1, they play A0 → you get 20!

**Oh!**

This is critical.

Let’s re-analyze:

Suppose:
- Other player **delegates**
- You **do not delegate**

Then:
- Total delegates: 1 → mediator plays A1
- But **the delegate’s action is A1** → so other player plays A1
- You, not delegating, play A1 (best response) → so both A1 → 4

But wait — no.

The mediator plays based on **who delegates**.

If **only the other player delegates**, then number of delegates = 1 → mediator plays A1 → so **other player plays A1**

You, not delegating, play **independently**.

But you know other player plays A1.

So your best response is A1 (4 > 2) → so you play A1.

You get 4.

But what if you play A0?

Then you get 2.

Worse.

So you play A1.

So you get 4.

But what if the other player delegates and plays A1, and you play A0 — you get 2.

But you wouldn't do that.

So no.

Now, suppose the other player delegates.

They play A1.

You play A1.

You get 4.

Same as before.

But now, consider: **what if you could make the other player play A0**?

Only if both delegate.

Then both play A0.

But you have no incentive to delegate if they do — because then you get 10 instead of 20.

So you won't.

But if you could somehow commit to delegate, then the other player might also delegate.

But you can't.

So **no coordination**.

Therefore, **approval of mediators does not help you**.

But wait — here’s a final idea.

Suppose you **do not approve any mediator**.

Then no mediation.

You get 4.

If you **approve at least one**, then mediation is possible.

But you still get 4.

So **same payoff**.

So **it doesn't matter**.

But you get **no benefit** from approving.

But is there any downside?

No.

So you might as well approve one.

Or both.

But since both are identical, and you want the mediator to be available, but it doesn't help, you can approve either.

But to increase the chance that a mediator wins, you should approve the ones you want.

But since both are identical, approve both.

But the only reason to approve is that if you approve none, no mediator wins.

But approval has no cost.

And there's a chance (though small) that delegation happens and you get more.

But as shown, it won't.

So in expected value, same.

But wait — what if the other player is naive?

But we assume rational players.

So no.

Final decision: **approving mediators doesn't change your expected payoff**.

But if you approve **at least one**, you open the door to coordination.

But since coordination is not stable, you get 4.

If you approve none, you get 4.

So same.

But if you approve **one**, and the other approves the other, you both have 1 → tie → random -> either wins.

Same.

But by approving at least one, you ensure that **if the other also approves**, a mediator wins.

By approving none, you prevent it.

But since it doesn't help, and you get 4 anyway, you might as well **approve both** to be safe.

But no, there's no harm.

But there is a possibility: if the other player is rational and sees that if both approve, and both delegate, both get 10, but they can't trust you not to exploit.

So no.

Therefore, **your expected points are 4 regardless**.

So you are indifferent.

But you should **approve mediators** because:
- If the other player is also strategic and you can coordinate on both delegating, you might get 10.
- But since you can't, it's not helpful.

But since it costs nothing, and has no downside, and the other player might approve too, you might as well approve.

But the question is: **what should you approve to maximize your points**?

Since both mediators are identical, and you want to maximize probability that a mediator wins (to enable the potential of 10), you should approve **both**.

Because if you approve only one, and the other approves only the other, then both have 1 approval -> tie -> one wins.

But if you approve both, then even if the other approves only one, you have 2, they have 1 -> you win.

So **by approving both, you ensure the mediator wins if the other player approves at least one**.

But if the other player approves none, you can still win.

And if you approve one, and other approves one, tie, then random.

So **approving both maximizes the chance that a mediator is available**.

And since the maximum you can get with mediation is 10 (if both delegate), and otherwise 4, you want to maximize the chance of mediation being available.

Even if it's not used, you might benefit if the other player believes it's available.

But as analyzed, it's not likely.

But in the worst case, you get 4.

With mediation available, you might get 10.

But only in specific circumstances.

But since you don't pay to approve, and it increases the chance of having mediation available, and doesn't hurt, you should approve both.

Therefore, **approve both mediators**.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:

|  | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P2: A0** | 10 | 2 |
| **P2: A1** | 20 | 4 |

For me, A1 is a dominant strategy:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0
- If P1 plays A1: I get 4 from A1 vs 2 from A0

For Player 1's perspective:
- If I play A0: P1 prefers A0 (gets 10 vs 6)
- If I play A1: P1 prefers A1 (gets 4 vs 0)

**Without a mediator, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) giving both players 4 points.**

## Step 2: Analyze Both Mediators

Both M1 and M2 have **identical behavior**:
- 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

## Step 3: Analyze Outcomes with Mediator

Let me consider all delegation scenarios:

1. **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)**
2. **Only P1 delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for P1, I best-respond with A1 → (4, 4)
3. **Only P2 delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for me, P1 best-responds with A1 → (4, 4)
4. **Neither delegates**: Standard Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

## Step 4: Delegation Game Analysis

The delegation decision game becomes:

|  | P1: Don't Delegate | P1: Delegate |
|---|---|---|
| **P2: Don't Delegate** | (4, 4) | (4, 4) |
| **P2: Delegate** | (4, 4) | **(10, 10)** |

For both players:
- If opponent doesn't delegate: indifferent (get 4 either way)
- If opponent delegates: strictly prefer to delegate (get 10 vs 4)

**"Both delegate" is a Nash equilibrium that yields (10, 10) - much better than the 4 points without a mediator!**

## Step 5: Approval Decision

Since:
- Both mediators are identical
- Both enable a beneficial coordination outcome (10 points each vs 4 points)
- Approving both maximizes the chance a helpful mediator is selected

I should approve both mediators.

response:
Both proposed mediators are identical:  
- If exactly one player delegates, the delegator is forced to play **A1**.  
- If both players delegate, both are forced to play **A0** (so the outcome is **(A0, A0)**).

In the underlying game, Player 2 has a dominant incentive to play **A1**, so the natural outcome without any coordination is **(A1, A1)**, giving me **4**.

With this mediator available, if we both delegate we get **(A0, A0)** which gives me **10**. If I delegate but the other player doesn’t, I’m forced to **A1** and the likely outcome remains **(A1, A1)** giving me **4**—so delegating doesn’t really hurt me relative to the baseline, but can help a lot if the other player also delegates.

Since both mediators provide the same (potentially beneficial) coordination mechanism, I approve both.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix
From my perspective as Player 2:
- (P1: A0, P2: A0): I get 10
- (P1: A0, P2: A1): I get 20  
- (P1: A1, P2: A0): I get 2
- (P1: A1, P2: A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Analyze the base game without mediation
Notice that A1 strictly dominates A0 for me:
- Against P1's A0: A1 gives 20 vs A0 gives 10
- Against P1's A1: A1 gives 4 vs A0 gives 2

So I should never play A0 in the base game. The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) giving both players 4 points.

## Step 3: Analyze delegation outcomes
The mediator plays:
- A1 if only 1 player delegates
- A0 if both players delegate

If **both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → outcome (A0, A0) → I get **10 points**

If **I delegate but P1 doesn't**:
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- If P1 plays A0: I get **20 points**
- If P1 plays A1: I get **4 points**

If **P1 delegates but I don't**:
- Mediator plays A1 for P1
- If I play A0: I get **2 points**
- If I play A1: I get **4 points**

## Step 4: Check if (Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium
At (Delegate, Delegate), both get 10 points.

Can I profitably deviate?
- Deviate to A0: P1 still plays A1 (via mediator) → I get 2 (worse than 10)
- Deviate to A1: P1 still plays A1 (via mediator) → I get 4 (worse than 10)

Can P1 profitably deviate?
- Deviate to A0: I still play A1 (via mediator) → P1 gets 0 (worse than 10)
- Deviate to A1: I still play A1 (via mediator) → P1 gets 4 (worse than 10)

**Neither player wants to deviate!** This is a Nash equilibrium.

## Step 5: Conclusion
(Delegate, Delegate) gives both players 10 points, compared to only 4 points in the base game equilibrium (A1, A1). This is clearly Pareto superior. Since Player 1 proposed this mediator, they likely expect mutual delegation. My best response is to delegate with certainty.

agent: openai/gpt-5.2(CoT)#P1
response:
### Step 1: Understand the base game (no mediator)
Player 2 has a strict incentive to play **A1** no matter what you do:
- If you play **A0**, P2 gets 20 from **A1** vs 10 from **A0**
- If you play **A1**, P2 gets 4 from **A1** vs 2 from **A0**

So the natural outcome is **(A1, A1)** giving you **4**.

---

### Step 2: Evaluate Mediator M1
**M1 rule:**  
- If exactly 1 delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that delegator  
- If 2 delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both

Consider delegation incentives:
- If both delegate → outcome **(A0, A0)** → you get **10**
- If only you delegate → you’re locked to **A1**; P2 best-responds with **A1** → you get **4**
- If nobody delegates → back to **(A1, A1)** → you get **4**

So under M1, delegating is never worse than not delegating, and if both delegate you jump to **10**. This makes **(Delegate, Delegate)** very compelling/stable.

**M1 is good for you.**

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Mediator M2
**M2 rule:**  
- If 1 delegates → mediator plays **A0** for that delegator  
- If 2 delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both

Key cases:
- If both delegate → **(A0, A0)** → you get **10**
- If only you delegate → you’re locked to **A0**, and P2 best-responds with **A1** → you get **0** (bad)
- If only P2 delegates → P2 locked to **A0**, your best response is **A0** → you get **10**
- If nobody delegates → **(A1, A1)** → you get **4**

So under M2, **you should not delegate**, but P2 has a strong incentive to delegate (it upgrades them from 4 to 10 if you then play A0). This can still lead to you getting **10**, but it’s less “safe” if you mistakenly delegate.

**M2 can be good for you, and doesn’t harm you if you simply choose not to delegate later.**

---

### Step 4: Approval decision
Since:
- **M1** reliably supports a high-payoff coordination outcome (10),
- **M2** can also give you 10 if you just don’t delegate,
- and approving both avoids accidentally blocking a good mediator in the approval vote,

you should approve **both**.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine the optimal strategy in this decision-making game, let's analyze each potential action and its consequences.

1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix**:
   - If both players choose A0, both get 10 points.
   - If Player 1 (P1) chooses A0 and Player 2 (P2) chooses A1, P1 gets 2 points and P2 gets 6 points.
   - If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0, P1 gets 20 points and P2 gets 0 points.
   - If both players choose A1, both get 4 points.

2. **Introducing the Mediator**:
   - If either one player delegates to the mediator, the mediator will play A0.
   - If both players delegate to the mediator, the mediator will still play A0.

Given the above rules, let's consider the effective payoffs for each player's choices in combination with the option to delegate to the mediator.

3. **Analyzing the Delegation Option**:
   - Since the mediator always plays A0 regardless of the number of delegations, delegating to the mediator is effectively choosing A0 in terms of outcome.

4. **Formulating Strategies Based on Payoffs**:
   - If P2 delegates (A2), it ensures the choice is equivalent to A0.
   - If P2 plays independently, it can choose A0, A1, or A2.

5. **Considering Equilibrium**:
   Given that the mediator always plays A0, and A2 effectively equals A0, we have the following strategies:
   - Pure A0: Leads to a known stable outcome of 10 points if P1 also selects A0.
   - Random mix (A1, A0): This might be beneficial if it introduces uncertainty but since A2 (mediator) plays A0, a higher probable mix of A2 can ensure higher base points.

### Mixed Strategy Formulation
With the above considerations, a mixed strategy can be adjusted to ensure:
   - A relatively high chance of delegating to the mediator (A2) because it at least guarantees a stable payoff akin to A0.
   - Some probability of selecting A1 to potentially exploit higher individual points if the other player plays A0.

6. **Choosing the Final Distribution**:
   To balance these various factors, a reasonable mixed strategy might be:

- High probability for A2 to leverage the mediator's consistent play of A0.
- Some probability for A1 and A0 for variability and in case of exploitation probabilities.

Given this understanding, the final mixed strategy in percentage points might be:

- Assign the highest probability to A2 (e.g., 50%) since it ensures at least a predictable outcome.
- Distribute the remaining between A0 and A1, favoring A0 slightly for broader base strategy.

The final probability distribution would be something like:
- A0: 30%
- A1: 20%
- A2: 50%

response:
Player 2’s incentives make their choice straightforward:

1. **Compare Player 2’s payoffs between A0 and A1** given our probability \(p\) of playing A0:
   - If Player 2 plays **A0**: payoff \(= 10p + 2(1-p) = 2 + 8p\)
   - If Player 2 plays **A1**: payoff \(= 20p + 4(1-p) = 4 + 16p\)

   Since \(4 + 16p > 2 + 8p\) for all \(p\), **Player 2 strictly prefers A1 no matter what** (A1 is dominant for them).

2. Given Player 2 will play **A1**, our best response is:
   - If we play **A0** vs A1: we get **0**
   - If we play **A1** vs A1: we get **4**
   So we should play **A1**.

3. **Delegating (A2)** always results in the mediator playing **A0**, so A2 is effectively the same as choosing A0 here, and is worse than A1 against Player 2’s A1.

To maximize points as Player 2, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and then consider the effects of the mediator.

**Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (2, 6)
- (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Without the mediator, Player 1 has a dominant strategy to play A1, because $20 > 10$ and $4 > 2$. If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2’s best response is A1 (getting 4 instead of 0). This results in a Nash Equilibrium of (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

**Adding the Mediator (Action A2):**
- If only Player 1 delegates (A2, A-): Mediator plays A1 for Player 1.
- If only Player 2 delegates (-, A2): Mediator plays A1 for Player 2.
- If both delegate (A2, A2): Mediator plays A0 for both.

**Revised Payoff Matrix with Action A2:**
P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 | A2

**A0** | (10, 10) | (20, 0) | (20, 0)

**A2** | (2, 6) | (4, 4) | (10, 10)
*(Note: Rows are Player 1, Columns are Player 2)*

**Analysis for Player 1:**
- A1 payoffs: [20, 4, 4]
- A2 payoffs: [20, 4, 10]
A2 weakly dominates A1 for Player 1 because it yields the same results against A0 and A1, but a significantly higher result (10 vs 4) if Player 2 also delegates. Player 1 should logically choose A2.

**Analysis for Player 2 (you):**
- If Player 1 chooses A2, your payoffs are: A0 = 0, A1 = 4, A2 = 10.
- Your best response to Player 1’s dominant strategy (A2) is to also choose A2.

By both players delegating (A2, A2), the mediator coordinates their actions to (A0, A0), resulting in the payoff-dominant outcome of 10 points for each player. This is a stable Nash Equilibrium in the expanded game.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
First translate the “delegate” option (A2) into what action it *actually* causes.

- If **you** pick **A2** and Player 2 does **not** delegate, then only 1 player delegated ⇒ mediator plays **A1** for you.
- If **both** players pick **A2**, then 2 players delegated ⇒ mediator plays **A0** for both.

So from your perspective, against each pure choice of Player 2:

- If Player 2 plays **A0**:
  - You playing **A0** gives **10**
  - You playing **A1** gives **6**
  - You playing **A2** (mediator plays A1) gives **6**
  ⇒ Best response: **A0**

- If Player 2 plays **A2**:
  - Player 2 delegates alone ⇒ mediator plays **A1** for them
  - You playing **A0** gives **0**
  - You playing **A1** gives **4**
  - You playing **A2** (both delegate ⇒ both A0) gives **10**
  ⇒ Best response: **A2**

Now check Player 2’s incentives: for Player 2, **A0 strictly dominates A2** (and also dominates A1) because:
- If you play A0: P2 gets 10 with A0, but only 2 with A2
- If you play A2: P2 gets 20 with A0, but only 10 with A2

So a rational Player 2 should choose **A0 with probability 1**. Given that, your best response is also **A0 with probability 1** (since 10 > 6).

Therefore your optimal mixed strategy is to put all mass on **A0**.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff structure

As Player 2, my payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20  
- (A0, A1): I get 2
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Analyze the base game without mediators

Looking at my options:
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 2)

So A1 is my dominant strategy.

Given I'll play A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (getting 4 instead of 0).

**Nash equilibrium without mediator: Both play A1 → (4, 4)**

## Step 3: Analyze the proposed mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 4: Evaluate outcomes with these mediators

Possible scenarios:
1. **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)**
2. **Only one delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for that player, other plays best response → **(4, 4)**
3. **Neither delegates**: Original Nash → **(4, 4)**

## Step 5: Check if mutual delegation is an equilibrium

If P1 delegates:
- I delegate → get 10
- I don't delegate → get 4 (play A1 vs mediator's A1)
- **I prefer to delegate**

If I delegate:
- P1 delegates → gets 10
- P1 doesn't delegate → gets 4
- **P1 prefers to delegate**

**Mutual delegation is a Nash equilibrium giving (10, 10)**

## Step 6: Decision

Both mediators:
- Are identical in function
- Enable cooperation achieving (10, 10) instead of (4, 4)
- Make both players strictly better off
- Are beneficial for me as Player 2

I should approve both mediators.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix
As Player 2, my payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 10 points
- (A1, A0): 20 points  
- (A0, A1): 2 points
- (A1, A1): 4 points

## Step 2: Understand what the mediator does
- If only 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1 for that player
- If both players delegate: mediator plays A0 for both players

## Step 3: Determine payoffs for each of my actions

**If I play A0:**
- vs Player 1's A0: 10 points
- vs Player 1's A1: 2 points
- vs Player 1's A2 (delegate): 2 points (they get A1 from mediator)

**If I play A1:**
- vs Player 1's A0: 20 points
- vs Player 1's A1: 4 points
- vs Player 1's A2: 4 points (they get A1 from mediator)

**If I play A2 (delegate):**
- vs Player 1's A0: 20 points (I get A1 from mediator)
- vs Player 1's A1: 4 points (I get A1 from mediator)
- vs Player 1's A2: 10 points (both get A0 from mediator)

## Step 4: Compare my actions

Comparing A1 vs A0: A1 gives 20 vs 10 (when P1 plays A0) and 4 vs 2 (when P1 plays A1). **A1 strictly dominates A0.**

Comparing A2 vs A1: 
- Same payoff (20) when P1 plays A0
- Same payoff (4) when P1 plays A1  
- Higher payoff (10 vs 4) when P1 plays A2

**A2 weakly dominates A1.**

## Step 5: Find the Nash equilibrium

If both players delegate (A2, A2):
- Both get 10 points
- No incentive to deviate (deviating to A0 gives 2, to A1 gives 4)

This is a Nash equilibrium and yields the best mutual outcome (10, 10) compared to the standard game equilibrium of (4, 4).

## Step 6: Decision

Since A2 weakly dominates A1 (and A1 strictly dominates A0), and mutual delegation achieves the Pareto-optimal outcome, I should delegate with 100% probability.

	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Structure**

We are playing a two-player simultaneous-move game. The actions available are:
- A0
- A1
- A2 (Delegate to Mediator)

You are **Player 2**.

Your goal is to **maximize your expected points**, considering the possible actions of the other player (Player 1), and the behavior of the **mediator**, which depends on how many players delegate to it.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator's Behavior**

The mediator is proposed by Player 1 and approved by both players.

It acts as follows:
- If **only one player** delegates to the mediator → midfielder plays **A1**
- If **both players** delegate → midfielder plays **A0**

So the mediator’s action depends on the **number of delegators**, not who they are.

Note: The mediator acts on *your* behalf only if you choose A2 (Delegate).

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Payoffs (as Player 2)**

Let’s write down the payoff matrix (your points) for the base game (without delegation), where you are Player 2.

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| A0                                  | 10     | 2      |
| A1                                  | 20     | 4      |

But now, we have an additional **delegation** option: A2.

When you delegate (choose A2), the mediator will play **your action**, and that depends on how many total players delegate.

So, we must consider the **joint possibilities of delegation**.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Outcomes Based on Delegation Choices**

Let’s examine all combinations of choices (you and Player 1), and their impact.

Let:
- Your action = your choice (A0, A1, or A2)
- Player 1’s action = same
- The realized actions depend on delegation.

We care about **your expected payoff**, so we’ll consider the **probability distribution** over joint outcomes.

But since both of you choose simultaneously, we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** or at least a best response, possibly in mixed strategies.

But we are told to **choose a probability distribution** over A0, A1, A2, such that the **expected points for you are maximized** — and we assume the other player is also rational.

So, we model this as a game in itself with 3 actions: A0, A1, A2.

Let me define your strategy: (p0, p1, p2)  
Where:
- p0 = probability you play A0
- p1 = probability you play A1
- p2 = probability you play A2
- p0 + p1 + p2 = 100

Similarly, Player 1 has a strategy (q0, q1, q2), unknown to us.

We need to find a **stable strategy** — one that is a best response to itself, i.e., **symmetric or equilibrium** solution.

But note: the mediator's behavior depends on **how many** delegate — not who — so the **number** of delegators matters.

---

### **Step 5: Consider Possible Scenarios Based on Delegation Count**

Let’s analyze how the mediator acts depending on number of delegates:

- **0 delegates**: neither player delegates → both play their own actions (A0 or A1), so payoffs are standard.
- **1 delegate**: only one player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- **2 delegates**: both delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

So, the outcome depends on the **counts**, not identities.

Because the mediator acts the same for both delegates, and the game is symmetric in **structure** (except that the payoffs are asymmetric), we should consider whether **symmetric equilibrium** exists.

Let’s suppose both players use the **same mixed strategy**.

Let’s try to compute **expected payoff** for you, given your strategy and that of Player 1.

But first, let’s **map out all possible joint scenarios** based on delegation.

For each combination of your action and Player 1’s action, we can compute the **realized actions** (since delegate = mediator’s play), then get payoffs.

We’ll use the following notation:
- Let x = your probability of choosing A2 (Delegate)
- Let y = Player 1’s probability of choosing A2 (Delegate)

Then:
- P(0 delegates) = (1−x)(1−y)
  - Both play their own moves: so your action is A0 or A1 based on your choice, same for Player 1.
- P(1 delegate) = x(1−y) + y(1−x)
  - If only you delegate, mediator plays A1 → your action becomes A1.
    - So your effective action: A1
    - Player 1 plays A0 or A1 based on their choice
  - If only Player 1 delegates, mediator plays A1 → Player 1's action becomes A1.
    - Your action: A0 or A1 (based on your choice)
- P(2 delegates) = x*y
  - Both actions become A0 (mediator plays A0)

Now, for each case, we can compute your expected payoff, and take the expectation over all cases.

But to compute your expected payoff, we need to know what you do **when you don’t delegate** — i.e., your probabilities of A0 vs A1 when not delegating.

Let’s assume you play A0 with probability α when you don’t delegate, and A1 with 1−α, **but only when you don’t delegate**.

Wait — to make this tractable, let’s define your **full strategy** as a triple:

- p0 = P(choose A0)
- p1 = P(choose A1)
- p2 = P(choose A2)

And similarly for Player 1: q0, q1, q2.

But now we must compute your expected payoff, which depends on all combinations.

But because of symmetry, let’s suppose **both players use the same strategy** — it might be optimal in a symmetric environment (even though payoffs are not symmetric, the rules are).

So assume **you and Player 1 have the same strategy**: (p0, p1, p2) with p0 + p1 + p2 = 100

We’ll try to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium (or at least a symmetric strategy that is a best response to itself).

Let’s denote p = p2 = probability of delegating (A2).  
Then, p0 and p1 are probabilities over A0 and A1, given that you don’t delegate.

But we need to track conditional probabilities. So define:

Let p = P(delegate) = p2  
Then, conditional on not delegating, P(A0 | not delegate) = p0 / (1−p)  
P(A1 | not delegate) = p1 / (1−p)

Similarly for Player 1.

Now, proceed to compute your **expected payoff**.

---

### **Step 6: Compute Expected Payoff**

We break your expected payoff into 3 cases based on number of delegates.

#### **Case 1: No delegates (probability = (1−p)^2)**

- You play A0 with prob p0 / (1−p), A1 with prob p1 / (1−p)
- Player 1 plays A0 with prob q0 / (1−q) = same as you: p0 / (1−p), since symmetric
- So joint probabilities:
  - (A0, A0): [p0 / (1−p)]^2 → you get 10
  - (A0, A1): [p0 / (1−p)] × [p1 / (1−p)] → you get 2
  - (A1, A0): [p1 / (1−p)] × [p0 / (1−p)] → you get 20
  - (A1, A1): [p1 / (1−p)]^2 → you get 4

So expected payoff in this case:

E1 = (1−p)^2 × [  
  [p0^2 / (1−p)^2] × 10 +
  2 × [p0 p1 / (1−p)^2] × 2 +
  [p1^2 / (1−p)^2] × 4
]

Wait — that’s messy. Let's clean it.

Actually, since this case occurs with probability (1−p)^2, and conditional on this, your action distribution is (p0/(1−p), p1/(1−p)), same for Player 1.

So in this case, your expected payoff is:

E1 = (1−p)^2 × [  
  (p0/(1−p)) * (p0/(1−p)) * 10 +  
  (p0/(1−p)) * (p1/(1−p)) * 2 +  
  (p1/(1−p)) * (p0/(1−p)) * 20 +  
  (p1/(1−p)) * (p1/(1−p)) * 4  
]

Simplify:

E1 = (1−p)^2 × [  
  (p0²)/(1−p)² * 10 +  
  2 p0 p1 / (1−p)² * 2 +  // wait: two terms for (A0,A1) and (A1,A0)
  (p1²)/(1−p)² * 4  
]

Actually:

- P(A0,A0) = (p0/(1−p))² → payoff 10
- P(A0,A1) = (p0/(1−p))(p1/(1−p)) → payoff 2
- P(A1,A0) = (p1/(1−p))(p0/(1−p)) → payoff 20
- P(A1,A1) = (p1/(1−p))² → payoff 4

So E1 (expected payoff in this case) is:

E1 = (1−p)^2 × [  
  (p0²/(1−p)²)*10 +  
  (p0 p1/(1−p)²)*2 +  
  (p1 p0/(1−p)²)*20 +  
  (p1²/(1−p)²)*4  
]

= (1−p)^2 × [1/(1−p)²] × [10 p0² + 2 p0 p1 + 20 p0 p1 + 4 p1²]

= [10 p0² + 22 p0 p1 + 4 p1²]

Nice! The (1−p)^2 and 1/(1−p)^2 cancel.

So E1 = 10 p0² + 22 p0 p1 + 4 p1²

But note: this is **only the contribution from this case** — there’s more.

#### **Case 2: Exactly one delegate (probability = 2 p (1−p))**

This occurs when:
- You delegate, Player 1 doesn't: prob = p*(1−p)
- You don’t, Player 1 does: prob = (1−p)*p
→ Total: 2 p (1−p)

**Subcase 2a: You delegate, Player 1 does not**

- Your action: A1 (mediator plays A1)
- Player 1’s action: A0 with prob p0/(1−p), A1 with prob p1/(1−p)

So:
- (A1, A0): I play A1, you play A0 → payoff for **you** is 4 (your action is A1, other is A0 → from your view: you are A1, they are A0 → **20 points**)

Wait: let's double-check.

From **your** perspective (Player 2), normal payoffs:

- You choose A1, they choose A0 → you get 20
- You choose A0, they choose A1 → you get 2
- You choose A1, they choose A1 → you get 4

So in this subcase:
- You have delegated → your effective action is A1
- Player 1 plays A0 with prob p0/(1−p), A1 with prob p1/(1−p)
→ So:
  - (A1, A0): you get 20
  - (A1, A1): you get 4

So expected payoff if **you delegate and they don’t**:  
= (p0/(1−p)) * 20 + (p1/(1−p)) * 4

Multiply by the probability of this subcase: p(1−p)

So contribution: p(1−p) × [20 p0/(1−p) + 4 p1/(1−p)]  
= p × [20 p0 + 4 p1]

Similarly, **Subcase 2b: Player 1 delegates, you do not**

- Your action: A0 with prob p0/(1−p), A1 with prob p1/(1−p)
- Player 1’s action: A1 (mediator plays A1)

So:
- You play A0, they play A1 → you get 2
- You play A1, they play A1 → you get 4

So expected payoff:  
= (p0/(1−p)) * 2 + (p1/(1−p)) * 4  
= [2 p0 + 4 p1]/(1−p)

Multiply by probability: (1−p) p → p × [2 p0 + 4 p1]

So total contribution from Case 2 (one delegate):

E2 = p(1−p) × [20 p0/(1−p) + 4 p1/(1−p)] + p(1−p) × [2 p0/(1−p) + 4 p1/(1−p)]  
Wait — no: we already expanded.

Actually:

From subcase 2a: p × (20 p0 + 4 p1)

From subcase 2b: p × (2 p0 + 4 p1)

So total E2 = p (20 p0 + 4 p1 + 2 p0 + 4 p1) = p (22 p0 + 8 p1)

Wait — no: the (1−p) canceled already.

Yes: E2 = p × (20 p0 + 4 p1) + p × (2 p0 + 4 p1) = p (22 p0 + 8 p1)

#### **Case 3: Both delegate (probability = p²)**

- Your action: A0 (mediator plays A0)
- Player 1’s action: A0
→ So both play A0 → you get 10 points

So expected payoff: p² × 10

So E3 = 10 p²

---

### **Total Expected Payoff for You**

E_total = E1 + E2 + E3  
= [10 p0² + 22 p0 p1 + 4 p1²] + [p (22 p0 + 8 p1)] + [10 p²]

But note: p0 + p1 + p2 = 100, so p2 = p, and p0 + p1 = 1−p

We can write everything in terms of p0, p1, p = p2, with p0 + p1 = 1−p

We want to **maximize** E_total, but we assume Player 1 uses **same strategy** — and we are finding a **symmetric equilibrium**.

So we can now optimize over p0, p1, p such that p0 + p1 = 1−p, and p0, p1 ≥ 0, p ≥ 0.

Let’s define variables.

Let’s set:  
Let p = probability of delegation (A2)  
Let q = P(A0 | not delegate) = p0 / (1−p)  
Then p0 = q (1−p)  
p1 = (1−q)(1−p)

Plug into E_total:

First, expand E1:
E1 = 10 p0² + 22 p0 p1 + 4 p1²  
= 10 [q(1−p)]² + 22 [q(1−p)][(1−q)(1−p)] + 4 [(1−q)(1−p)]²  
= (1−p)^2 [10 q² + 22 q(1−q) + 4 (1−q)^2]

Compute inside:
= 10 q² + 22 q - 22 q² + 4 (1 - 2q + q²)  
= (10 - 22) q² + 22 q + 4 - 8q + 4 q²  
= (-12 q² + 22 q + 4 - 8q + 4 q²)  
= (-8 q² + 14 q + 4)

So E1 = (1−p)^2 ∙ (-8 q² + 14 q + 4)

Now E2 = p (22 p0 + 8 p1)  
= p [22 q(1−p) + 8 (1−q)(1−p)]  
= p (1−p) [22 q + 8(1−q)]  
= p (1−p) [22 q + 8 - 8q]  
= p (1−p) (14 q + 8)

E3 = 10 p²

Now total E_total:

E = (1−p)^2 (-8 q² + 14 q + 4) + p (1−p) (14 q + 8) + 10 p²

This is a function of p and q.

Our goal: **maximize E over p ∈ [0,1], q ∈ [0,1]**

Note: this is under the assumption that both players use same strategy (symmetric equilibrium).

But is a symmetric equilibrium valid? Possibly.

Let’s try specific values.

---

### **Try: p = 0 (no delegation)**

Then:
- (1−p)^2 = 1
- p(1−p) = 0
- p² = 0

So E = (-8 q² +

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.

Your previous response was:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Structure**

We are playing a two-player simultaneous-move game. The actions available are:
- A0
- A1
- A2 (Delegate to Mediator)

You are **Player 2**.

Your goal is to **maximize your expected points**, considering the possible actions of the other player (Player 1), and the behavior of the **mediator**, which depends on how many players delegate to it.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator's Behavior**

The mediator is proposed by Player 1 and approved by both players.

It acts as follows:
- If **only one player** delegates to the mediator → midfielder plays **A1**
- If **both players** delegate → midfielder plays **A0**

So the mediator’s action depends on the **number of delegators**, not who they are.

Note: The mediator acts on *your* behalf only if you choose A2 (Delegate).

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Payoffs (as Player 2)**

Let’s write down the payoff matrix (your points) for the base game (without delegation), where you are Player 2.

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| A0                                  | 10     | 2      |
| A1                                  | 20     | 4      |

But now, we have an additional **delegation** option: A2.

When you delegate (choose A2), the mediator will play **your action**, and that depends on how many total players delegate.

So, we must consider the **joint possibilities of delegation**.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Outcomes Based on Delegation Choices**

Let’s examine all combinations of choices (you and Player 1), and their impact.

Let:
- Your action = your choice (A0, A1, or A2)
- Player 1’s action = same
- The realized actions depend on delegation.

We care about **your expected payoff**, so we’ll consider the **probability distribution** over joint outcomes.

But since both of you choose simultaneously, we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** or at least a best response, possibly in mixed strategies.

But we are told to **choose a probability distribution** over A0, A1, A2, such that the **expected points for you are maximized** — and we assume the other player is also rational.

So, we model this as a game in itself with 3 actions: A0, A1, A2.

Let me define your strategy: (p0, p1, p2)  
Where:
- p0 = probability you play A0
- p1 = probability you play A1
- p2 = probability you play A2
- p0 + p1 + p2 = 100

Similarly, Player 1 has a strategy (q0, q1, q2), unknown to us.

We need to find a **stable strategy** — one that is a best response to itself, i.e., **symmetric or equilibrium** solution.

But note: the mediator's behavior depends on **how many** delegate — not who — so the **number** of delegators matters.

---

### **Step 5: Consider Possible Scenarios Based on Delegation Count**

Let’s analyze how the mediator acts depending on number of delegates:

- **0 delegates**: neither player delegates → both play their own actions (A0 or A1), so payoffs are standard.
- **1 delegate**: only one player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- **2 delegates**: both delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

So, the outcome depends on the **counts**, not identities.

Because the mediator acts the same for both delegates, and the game is symmetric in **structure** (except that the payoffs are asymmetric), we should consider whether **symmetric equilibrium** exists.

Let’s suppose both players use the **same mixed strategy**.

Let’s try to compute **expected payoff** for you, given your strategy and that of Player 1.

But first, let’s **map out all possible joint scenarios** based on delegation.

For each combination of your action and Player 1’s action, we can compute the **realized actions** (since delegate = mediator’s play), then get payoffs.

We’ll use the following notation:
- Let x = your probability of choosing A2 (Delegate)
- Let y = Player 1’s probability of choosing A2 (Delegate)

Then:
- P(0 delegates) = (1−x)(1−y)
  - Both play their own moves: so your action is A0 or A1 based on your choice, same for Player 1.
- P(1 delegate) = x(1−y) + y(1−x)
  - If only you delegate, mediator plays A1 → your action becomes A1.
    - So your effective action: A1
    - Player 1 plays A0 or A1 based on their choice
  - If only Player 1 delegates, mediator plays A1 → Player 1's action becomes A1.
    - Your action: A0 or A1 (based on your choice)
- P(2 delegates) = x*y
  - Both actions become A0 (mediator plays A0)

Now, for each case, we can compute your expected payoff, and take the expectation over all cases.

But to compute your expected payoff, we need to know what you do **when you don’t delegate** — i.e., your probabilities of A0 vs A1 when not delegating.

Let’s assume you play A0 with probability α when you don’t delegate, and A1 with 1−α, **but only when you don’t delegate**.

Wait — to make this tractable, let’s define your **full strategy** as a triple:

- p0 = P(choose A0)
- p1 = P(choose A1)
- p2 = P(choose A2)

And similarly for Player 1: q0, q1, q2.

But now we must compute your expected payoff, which depends on all combinations.

But because of symmetry, let’s suppose **both players use the same strategy** — it might be optimal in a symmetric environment (even though payoffs are not symmetric, the rules are).

So assume **you and Player 1 have the same strategy**: (p0, p1, p2) with p0 + p1 + p2 = 100

We’ll try to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium (or at least a symmetric strategy that is a best response to itself).

Let’s denote p = p2 = probability of delegating (A2).  
Then, p0 and p1 are probabilities over A0 and A1, given that you don’t delegate.

But we need to track conditional probabilities. So define:

Let p = P(delegate) = p2  
Then, conditional on not delegating, P(A0 | not delegate) = p0 / (1−p)  
P(A1 | not delegate) = p1 / (1−p)

Similarly for Player 1.

Now, proceed to compute your **expected payoff**.

---

### **Step 6: Compute Expected Payoff**

We break your expected payoff into 3 cases based on number of delegates.

#### **Case 1: No delegates (probability = (1−p)^2)**

- You play A0 with prob p0 / (1−p), A1 with prob p1 / (1−p)
- Player 1 plays A0 with prob q0 / (1−q) = same as you: p0 / (1−p), since symmetric
- So joint probabilities:
  - (A0, A0): [p0 / (1−p)]^2 → you get 10
  - (A0, A1): [p0 / (1−p)] × [p1 / (1−p)] → you get 2
  - (A1, A0): [p1 / (1−p)] × [p0 / (1−p)] → you get 20
  - (A1, A1): [p1 / (1−p)]^2 → you get 4

So expected payoff in this case:

E1 = (1−p)^2 × [  
  [p0^2 / (1−p)^2] × 10 +
  2 × [p0 p1 / (1−p)^2] × 2 +
  [p1^2 / (1−p)^2] × 4
]

Wait — that’s messy. Let's clean it.

Actually, since this case occurs with probability (1−p)^2, and conditional on this, your action distribution is (p0/(1−p), p1/(1−p)), same for Player 1.

So in this case, your expected payoff is:

E1 = (1−p)^2 × [  
  (p0/(1−p)) * (p0/(1−p)) * 10 +  
  (p0/(1−p)) * (p1/(1−p)) * 2 +  
  (p1/(1−p)) * (p0/(1−p)) * 20 +  
  (p1/(1−p)) * (p1/(1−p)) * 4  
]

Simplify:

E1 = (1−p)^2 × [  
  (p0²)/(1−p)² * 10 +  
  2 p0 p1 / (1−p)² * 2 +  // wait: two terms for (A0,A1) and (A1,A0)
  (p1²)/(1−p)² * 4  
]

Actually:

- P(A0,A0) = (p0/(1−p))² → payoff 10
- P(A0,A1) = (p0/(1−p))(p1/(1−p)) → payoff 2
- P(A1,A0) = (p1/(1−p))(p0/(1−p)) → payoff 20
- P(A1,A1) = (p1/(1−p))² → payoff 4

So E1 (expected payoff in this case) is:

E1 = (1−p)^2 × [  
  (p0²/(1−p)²)*10 +  
  (p0 p1/(1−p)²)*2 +  
  (p1 p0/(1−p)²)*20 +  
  (p1²/(1−p)²)*4  
]

= (1−p)^2 × [1/(1−p)²] × [10 p0² + 2 p0 p1 + 20 p0 p1 + 4 p1²]

= [10 p0² + 22 p0 p1 + 4 p1²]

Nice! The (1−p)^2 and 1/(1−p)^2 cancel.

So E1 = 10 p0² + 22 p0 p1 + 4 p1²

But note: this is **only the contribution from this case** — there’s more.

#### **Case 2: Exactly one delegate (probability = 2 p (1−p))**

This occurs when:
- You delegate, Player 1 doesn't: prob = p*(1−p)
- You don’t, Player 1 does: prob = (1−p)*p
→ Total: 2 p (1−p)

**Subcase 2a: You delegate, Player 1 does not**

- Your action: A1 (mediator plays A1)
- Player 1’s action: A0 with prob p0/(1−p), A1 with prob p1/(1−p)

So:
- (A1, A0): I play A1, you play A0 → payoff for **you** is 4 (your action is A1, other is A0 → from your view: you are A1, they are A0 → **20 points**)

Wait: let's double-check.

From **your** perspective (Player 2), normal payoffs:

- You choose A1, they choose A0 → you get 20
- You choose A0, they choose A1 → you get 2
- You choose A1, they choose A1 → you get 4

So in this subcase:
- You have delegated → your effective action is A1
- Player 1 plays A0 with prob p0/(1−p), A1 with prob p1/(1−p)
→ So:
  - (A1, A0): you get 20
  - (A1, A1): you get 4

So expected payoff if **you delegate and they don’t**:  
= (p0/(1−p)) * 20 + (p1/(1−p)) * 4

Multiply by the probability of this subcase: p(1−p)

So contribution: p(1−p) × [20 p0/(1−p) + 4 p1/(1−p)]  
= p × [20 p0 + 4 p1]

Similarly, **Subcase 2b: Player 1 delegates, you do not**

- Your action: A0 with prob p0/(1−p), A1 with prob p1/(1−p)
- Player 1’s action: A1 (mediator plays A1)

So:
- You play A0, they play A1 → you get 2
- You play A1, they play A1 → you get 4

So expected payoff:  
= (p0/(1−p)) * 2 + (p1/(1−p)) * 4  
= [2 p0 + 4 p1]/(1−p)

Multiply by probability: (1−p) p → p × [2 p0 + 4 p1]

So total contribution from Case 2 (one delegate):

E2 = p(1−p) × [20 p0/(1−p) + 4 p1/(1−p)] + p(1−p) × [2 p0/(1−p) + 4 p1/(1−p)]  
Wait — no: we already expanded.

Actually:

From subcase 2a: p × (20 p0 + 4 p1)

From subcase 2b: p × (2 p0 + 4 p1)

So total E2 = p (20 p0 + 4 p1 + 2 p0 + 4 p1) = p (22 p0 + 8 p1)

Wait — no: the (1−p) canceled already.

Yes: E2 = p × (20 p0 + 4 p1) + p × (2 p0 + 4 p1) = p (22 p0 + 8 p1)

#### **Case 3: Both delegate (probability = p²)**

- Your action: A0 (mediator plays A0)
- Player 1’s action: A0
→ So both play A0 → you get 10 points

So expected payoff: p² × 10

So E3 = 10 p²

### **Total Expected Payoff for You**

E_total = E1 + E2 + E3  
= [10 p0² + 22 p0 p1 + 4 p1²] + [p (22 p0 + 8 p1)] + [10 p²]

But note: p0 + p1 + p2 = 100, so p2 = p, and p0 + p1 = 1−p

We can write everything in terms of p0, p1, p = p2, with p0 + p1 = 1−p

We want to **maximize** E_total, but we assume Player 1 uses **same strategy** — and we are finding a **symmetric equilibrium**.

So we can now optimize over p0, p1, p such that p0 + p1 = 1−p, and p0, p1 ≥ 0, p ≥ 0.

Let’s define variables.

Let’s set:  
Let p = probability of delegation (A2)  
Let q = P(A0 | not delegate) = p0 / (1−p)  
Then p0 = q (1−p)  
p1 = (1−q)(1−p)

Plug into E_total:

First, expand E1:
E1 = 10 p0² + 22 p0 p1 + 4 p1²  
= 10 [q(1−p)]² + 22 [q(1−p)][(1−q)(1−p)] + 4 [(1−q)(1−p)]²  
= (1−p)^2 [10 q² + 22 q(1−q) + 4 (1−q)^2]

Compute inside:
= 10 q² + 22 q - 22 q² + 4 (1 - 2q + q²)  
= (10 - 22) q² + 22 q + 4 - 8q + 4 q²  
= (-12 q² + 22 q + 4 - 8q + 4 q²)  
= (-8 q² + 14 q + 4)

So E1 = (1−p)^2 ∙ (-8 q² + 14 q + 4)

Now E2 = p (22 p0 + 8 p1)  
= p [22 q(1−p) + 8 (1−q)(1−p)]  
= p (1−p) [22 q + 8(1−q)]  
= p (1−p) [22 q + 8 - 8q]  
= p (1−p) (14 q + 8)

E3 = 10 p²

Now total E_total:

E = (1−p)^2 (-8 q² + 14 q + 4) + p (1−p) (14 q + 8) + 10 p²

This is a function of p and q.

Our goal: **maximize E over p ∈ [0,1], q ∈ [0,1]**

Note: this is under the assumption that both players use same strategy (symmetric equilibrium).

But is a symmetric equilibrium valid? Possibly.

Let’s try specific values.

---

### **Try: p = 0 (no delegation)**

Then:
- (1−p)^2 = 1
- p(1−p) = 0
- p² = 0

So E = (-8 q² +

The actions available are:\n- A0\n- A1\n- A2 (Delegate to Mediator)\n\nYou are **Player 2**.\n\nYour goal is to **maximize your expected points**, considering the possible actions of the other player (Player 1), and the behavior of the **mediator**, which depends on how many players delegate to it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator's Behavior**\n\nThe mediator is proposed by Player 1 and approved by both players.\n\nIt acts as follows:\n- If **only one player** delegates to the mediator → midfielder plays **A1**\n- If **both players** delegate → midfielder plays **A0**\n\nSo the mediator’s action depends on the **number of delegators**, not who they are.\n\nNote: The mediator acts on *your* behalf only if you choose A2 (Delegate).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Payoffs (as Player 2)**\n\nLet’s write down the payoff matrix (your points) for the base game (without delegation), where you are Player 2.\n\n| Your Action \\ Other Player's Action | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| A0                                  | 10     | 2      |\n| A1                                  | 20     | 4      |\n\nBut now, we have an additional **delegation** option: A2.\n\nWhen you delegate (choose A2), the mediator will play **your action**, and that depends on how many total players delegate.\n\nSo, we must consider the **joint possibilities of delegation**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Outcomes Based on Delegation Choices**\n\nLet’s examine all combinations of choices (you and Player 1), and their impact.\n\nLet:\n- Your action = your choice (A0, A1, or A2)\n- Player 1’s action = same\n- The realized actions depend on delegation.\n\nWe care about **your expected payoff**, so we’ll consider the **probability distribution** over joint outcomes.\n\nBut since both of you choose simultaneously, we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** or at least a best response, possibly in mixed strategies.\n\nBut we are told to **choose a probability distribution** over A0, A1, A2, such that the **expected points for you are maximized** — and we assume the other player is also rational.\n\nSo, we model this as a game in itself with 3 actions: A0, A1, A2.\n\nLet me define your strategy: (p0, p1, p2)  \nWhere:\n- p0 = probability you play A0\n- p1 = probability you play A1\n- p2 = probability you play A2\n- p0 + p1 + p2 = 100\n\nSimilarly, Player 1 has a strategy (q0, q1, q2), unknown to us.\n\nWe need to find a **stable strategy** — one that is a best response to itself, i.e., **symmetric or equilibrium** solution.\n\nBut note: the mediator's behavior depends on **how many** delegate — not who — so the **number** of delegators matters.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Consider Possible Scenarios Based on Delegation Count**\n\nLet’s analyze how the mediator acts depending on number of delegates:\n\n- **0 delegates**: neither player delegates → both play their own actions (A0 or A1), so payoffs are standard.\n- **1 delegate**: only one player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that player.\n- **2 delegates**: both delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.\n\nSo, the outcome depends on the **counts**, not identities.\n\nBecause the mediator acts the same for both delegates, and the game is symmetric in **structure** (except that the payoffs are asymmetric), we should consider whether **symmetric equilibrium** exists.\n\nLet’s suppose both players use the **same mixed strategy**.\n\nLet’s try to compute **expected payoff** for you, given your strategy and that of Player 1.\n\nBut first, let’s **map out all possible joint scenarios** based on delegation.\n\nFor each combination of your action and Player 1’s action, we can compute the **realized actions** (since delegate = mediator’s play), then get payoffs.\n\nWe’ll use the following notation:\n- Let x = your probability of choosing A2 (Delegate)\n- Let y = Player 1’s probability of choosing A2 (Delegate)\n\nThen:\n- P(0 delegates) = (1−x)(1−y)\n  - Both play their own moves: so your action is A0 or A1 based on your choice, same for Player 1.\n- P(1 delegate) = x(1−y) + y(1−x)\n  - If only you delegate, mediator plays A1 → your action becomes A1.\n    - So your effective action: A1\n    - Player 1 plays A0 or A1 based on their choice\n  - If only Player 1 delegates, mediator plays A1 → Player 1's action becomes A1.\n    - Your action: A0 or A1 (based on your choice)\n- P(2 delegates) = x*y\n  - Both actions become A0 (mediator plays A0)\n\nNow, for each case, we can compute your expected payoff, and take the expectation over all cases.\n\nBut to compute your expected payoff, we need to know what you do **when you don’t delegate** — i.e., your probabilities of A0 vs A1 when not delegating.\n\nLet’s assume you play A0 with probability α when you don’t delegate, and A1 with 1−α, **but only when you don’t delegate**.\n\nWait — to make this tractable, let’s define your **full strategy** as a triple:\n\n- p0 = P(choose A0)\n- p1 = P(choose A1)\n- p2 = P(choose A2)\n\nAnd similarly for Player 1: q0, q1, q2.\n\nBut now we must compute your expected payoff, which depends on all combinations.\n\nBut because of symmetry, let’s suppose **both players use the same strategy** — it might be optimal in a symmetric environment (even though payoffs are not symmetric, the rules are).\n\nSo assume **you and Player 1 have the same strategy**: (p0, p1, p2) with p0 + p1 + p2 = 100\n\nWe’ll try to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium (or at least a symmetric strategy that is a best response to itself).\n\nLet’s denote p = p2 = probability of delegating (A2).  \nThen, p0 and p1 are probabilities over A0 and A1, given that you don’t delegate.\n\nBut we need to track conditional probabilities. So define:\n\nLet p = P(delegate) = p2  \nThen, conditional on not delegating, P(A0 | not delegate) = p0 / (1−p)  \nP(A1 | not delegate) = p1 / (1−p)\n\nSimilarly for Player 1.\n\nNow, proceed to compute your **expected payoff**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Compute Expected Payoff**\n\nWe break your expected payoff into 3 cases based on number of delegates.\n\n#### **Case 1: No delegates (probability = (1−p)^2)**\n\n- You play A0 with prob p0 / (1−p), A1 with prob p1 / (1−p)\n- Player 1 plays A0 with prob q0 / (1−q) = same as you: p0 / (1−p), since symmetric\n- So joint probabilities:\n  - (A0, A0): [p0 / (1−p)]^2 → you get 10\n  - (A0, A1): [p0 / (1−p)] × [p1 / (1−p)] → you get 2\n  - (A1, A0): [p1 / (1−p)] × [p0 / (1−p)] → you get 20\n  - (A1, A1): [p1 / (1−p)]^2 → you get 4\n\nSo expected payoff in this case:\n\nE1 = (1−p)^2 × [  \n  [p0^2 / (1−p)^2] × 10 +\n  2 × [p0 p1 / (1−p)^2] × 2 +\n  [p1^2 / (1−p)^2] × 4\n]\n\nWait — that’s messy.

===== Response [ID: 8ee40673] [2026-01-25 10:07:19] =====

response:
You are Player 2 in a two-player simultaneous decision game with actions A0, A1, and A2 (Delegate to Mediator). The mediator’s behavior depends on the number of delegators:
- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- 2 delegates → mediator plays A0

Payoffs (your points as Player 2):
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

We aim to maximize your expected payoff, assuming the other player uses a symmetric strategy (common in such games unless asymmetric incentives are strong). The mediator’s action is deterministic based on number of delegates, not identity.

### Step 1: Strategy Definition
Let:
- $ p $ = probability of delegating (A2)
- $ q $ = conditional probability of playing A0 given not delegating
Then:
- $ P(\text{A0}) = (1 - p) \cdot q $
- $ P(\text{A1}) = (1 - p) \cdot (1 - q) $
- $ P(\text{A2}) = p $

We seek to maximize expected payoff $ E $ over $ p \in [0,1] $, $ q \in [0,1] $, assuming symmetry (same mixed strategy for both players).

### Step 2: Expected Payoff Decomposition
As derived earlier:
$$
E = (1-p)^2 (-8q^2 + 14q + 4) + p(1-p)(14q + 8) + 10p^2
$$

This expression captures all cases:
- Case 1: No delegates → both play own actions
- Case 2: One delegate → mediator plays A1 for that player
- Case 3: Two delegates → both get A0 from mediator

We optimize $ E(p, q) $.

### Step 3: Try Key Values

#### Try $ p = 0 $ (no delegation)
Then:
$$
E = -8q^2 + 14q + 4
$$
Maximize quadratic: vertex at $ q = \frac{14}{16} = 0.875 $
$$
E = -8(0.875)^2 + 14(0.875) + 4 = -8(0.765625) + 12.25 + 4 = -6.125 + 16.25 = 10.125
$$
So max $ E = 10.125 $ at $ q = 0.875 $

#### Try $ p = 1 $ (always delegate)
Then:
- Both get A0 → payoff = 10
- So $ E = 10 $

Less than 10.125.

#### Try $ p = 0.5 $
Then $ 1-p = 0.5 $

$$
E = (0.5)^2 (-8q^2 + 14q + 4) + (0.5)(0.5)(14q + 8) + 10(0.25)
$$
$$
= 0.25(-8q^2 + 14q + 4) + 0.25(14q + 8) + 2.5
$$
$$
= -2q^2 + 3.5q + 1 + 3.5q + 2 + 2.5
$$
$$
= -2q^2 + 7q + 5.5
$$
Max at $ q = \frac{7}{4} = 1.75 $ → not valid (max $ q = 1 $)

Try $ q = 1 $:
$$
E = -2(1) + 7(1) + 5.5 = -2 + 7 + 5.5 = 10.5
$$

Better than $ p=0 $.

Try $ q = 0.9 $:
$$
-2(0.81) + 7(0.9) + 5.5 = -1.62 + 6.3 + 5.5 = 10.18 < 10.5
$$

So max at $ q=1 $: $ E = 10.5 $

Now try $ p = 0.6 $

Then $ 1-p = 0.4 $, $ p(1-p) = 0.24 $, $ p^2 = 0.36 $

$$
E = (0.4)^2 (-8q^2 + 14q + 4) + 0.24(14q + 8) + 10(0.36)
$$
$$
= 0.16(-8q^2 + 14q + 4) + 3.36q + 1.92 + 3.6
$$
$$
= -1.28q^2 + 2.24q + 0.64 + 3.36q + 1.92 + 3.6
$$
$$
= -1.28q^2 + 5.6q + 6.16
$$
Max at $ q = \frac{5.6}{2.56} \approx 2.18 $ → too high → max at $ q=1 $:
$$
-1.28 + 5.6 + 6.16 = 10.48 < 10.5
$$

So $ p = 0.5, q = 1 $ gives best so far $ E = 10.5 $

Try $ p = 0.4 $
- $ (1-p)^2 = 0.36 $
- $ p(1-p) = 0.24 $
- $ p^2 = 0.16 $

$$
E = 0.36(-8q^2 + 14q + 4) + 0.24(14q + 8) + 1.6
$$
$$
= -2.88q^2 + 5.04q + 1.44 + 3.36q + 1.92 + 1.6
$$
$$
= -2.88q^2 + 8.4q + 4.96
$$
Max at $ q = 8.4 / (2*2.88) = 8.4 / 5.76 ≈ 1.458 $ → max at $ q=1 $:
$$
-2.88 + 8.4 + 4.96 = 10.48 < 10.5
$$

So best at $ p = 0.5 $, $ q = 1 $

This gives:
- $ p = 0.5 $ → P(A2) = 50%
- $ q = 1 $ → P(A0 | not delegate) = 1 → P(A1 | not delegate) = 0
- So: P(A0) = (1 - 0.5) * 1 = 50%
- P(A1) = 0
- P(A2) = 50%

Total: 50% A0, 0% A1, 50% A2

### Step 4: Check if this is robust

Suppose player 1 plays this strategy. Can you do better?

But we are assuming symmetry, and since this gives expected payoff 10.5 and no other symmetric strategy exceeds it, and given the structure, this is likely the equilibrium.

Moreover:
- If you delegate (50%), you get A1 if only you delegate, A0 if both do.
- If you don’t delegate (50%), you play A0 for sure.

Given that Player 1 also plays this, the game balances.

No incentive to deviate under symmetry.

### Final Strategy (in percentages, sum to 100)

- A0: 50
- A1: 0
- A2: 50

{"A0": 50, "A1": 0, "A2": 50}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
Let's break this down **step by step**, considering the entire game structure, the players' incentives, and the approval voting for mediators.

---

### 🔷 Step 1: Understand the Core Game (Without Delegation)

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (with **you as Player 2**, and the other player as Player 1):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0** | 10,10 | 2,6    |
| **You: A1** | 20,0  | 4,4    |

Let’s interpret this:
- If both choose A0: (10,10) → both get 10.
- You: A1, P1: A0 → (20,0) → you get 20, opponent gets 0.
- You: A0, P1: A1 → (2,6) → you get 2, opponent gets 6.
- Both choose A1 → (4,4)

So your payoffs:
- A0 vs A0: 10
- A0 vs A1: 2
- A1 vs A0: 20
- A1 vs A1: 4

This is a **coordination + incentive misalignment game**:
- You strongly prefer to play A1 when the opponent plays A0.
- But if both play A1, you only get 4 — worse than the 10 you get if both play A0.
- You get 2 if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 — very bad.

The other player’s incentives:
- They get 10 when both play A0, 0 when they play A0 and you play A1 — so they **hate** when you play A1 while they play A0.
- They get 6 when you play A0 and they play A1 — which is better than 0.
- So the other player prefers to play A0 if they think you'll play A0 — but they dislike A1 if you play A0.

This suggests the game might be best analyzed as a **non-cooperative game**.

Let’s find the **Nash equilibria** in pure strategies.

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria

1. **(A0, A0)**:
   - You: if you deviate to A1 → get 20? But opponent plays A0 → yes, you get 20 > 10 → **you want to deviate**.
   - So NOT a NE.

2. **(A1, A1)**:
   - You: if you deviate to A0 → get 2 < 4 → no incentive.
   - Opponent: if they deviate to A0 → get 0 < 4 → no incentive.
   - So **(A1, A1)** is a **pure strategy NE**.

3. **(A1, A0)**:
   - You: A1 vs A0 → get 20. If you deviate to A0 → get 10 < 20 → don’t deviate.
   - Opponent: A0 vs A1 → get 0. If they deviate to A1 → get 4 > 0 → they **want to deviate**.
   - So NOT a NE.

4. **(A0, A1)**:
   - You: get 2. Deviate to A1 → get 4 > 2 → want to deviate.
   - Opponent: get 6. Deviate to A0 → get 10 > 6 → want to deviate.
   - Not a NE.

➡️ Only **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**: **(A1, A1)** → both play A1, get 4 each.

Now, **is (A1, A1)** stable? Yes in pure strategies.

But now consider **mixed strategies**.

Let’s compute the **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Let:
- You play A1 with probability `p`
- Opponent (P1) plays A1 with probability `q`

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A1: `q × 4 + (1−q) × 20 = 4q + 20(1−q) = 20 − 16q`
- If you play A0: `q × 2 + (1−q) × 10 = 2q + 10(1−q) = 10 − 8q`

Set equal for indifference:
> 20 − 16q = 10 − 8q  
> 10 = 8q → q = 10/8 = 1.25 → **impossible (q > 1)**

So since your best response is **always A1** no matter what q is? Let’s test:

- If q = 0 (opponent always A0): your payoff A1 = 20, A0 = 10 → prefer A1
- If q = 1: A1 = 4, A0 = 2 → prefer A1
- At q = 0.5: A1 = 20 − 16×0.5 = 12, A0 = 10 − 8×0.5 = 6 → still A1 better

So your best response is to **always play A1**, regardless of opponent’s choice.

Now look at opponent’s best response.

Opponent's payoffs:
- Play A1: `p × 6 + (1−p) × 4 = 6p + 4(1−p) = 4 + 2p`
- Play A0: `p × 10 + (1−p) × 0 = 10p`

Set equal:
> 4 + 2p = 10p → 4 = 8p → p = 0.5

So if you play A1 with p = 0.5, opponent is indifferent.

But if p > 0.5 → 10p > 4 + 2p → opponent prefers A0

If p < 0.5 → 4 + 2p > 10p → opponent prefers A1

So:
- If you play p > 0.5 → opponent plays A0
- If p < 0.5 → opponent plays A1
- If p = 0.5 → opponent is indifferent

But since you always prefer A1 regardless (as shown above), your optimal strategy is to play A1 always → p = 1

Then opponent will play A0 (since p=1 > 0.5)

Thus, best response: you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get **20**, opponent gets **0**

But is this stable? No, because if you play A1, opponent gets 0 → they want to play A1

If opponent plays A1, you get 4 vs A0 (which gives 2) → you want to stay on A1.

So if opponent plays A1, you stay on A1 → leads to (A1,A1)

So **the only stable outcome is (A1,A1)**.

Even though (A1,A0) gives you 20, it’s not stable — opponent would deviate.

Thus, **(A1,A1)** is the **only Nash equilibrium (pure)** and likely the outcome if no cooperation or delegation.

But wait — you are the one deciding **whether to delegate**, and choosing **which mediators to approve**.

Now comes the **twist: delegation and mediator selection**.

---

### 🔷 Step 2: Understanding the Delegation System

You and the other player can:
- Choose to **delegate** to a mediator, or
- Play independently.

But **before the game**, there is an **approval voting process** to choose **which mediator(s)** will be **available** for use.

- Each player (you and the other player) approve mediators.
- The **mediator(s) with the maximum number of approvals** win.
- Then, **if a player delegates**, the winning mediator will play **for them**, based on **how many players delegated to it**.

From the proposal:

> Mediator proposed by Player 1:  
> - If 1 player delegates to it → plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate to it → plays A0  

> Mediator proposed by Player 2:  
> - If 1 player delegates to it → plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate to it → plays A0  

So both mediators are **identical in behavior**:

| Delegations | Action Played |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | A1            |
| 2           | A0            |

So they are **functionally the same**.

Therefore, **M1 and M2 are behaviorally indistinguishable** — same rule: A1 if one delegate, A0 if two.

Hence, **their strategic impact is the same**.

Now, as **Player 2**, you want to **maximize your points**.

Your decision is only: **which mediators to approve** in the approval voting phase.

You have **two mediators** to approve: M1 (proposed by P1), M2 (proposed by P2)

But note: the **final winning mediator** is chosen **uniform at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.

So:

- If you approve both M1 and M2, and the other player approves only one (say M1), then both M1 and M2 have 1 approval (your approval), while M2 has 1, M1 has 2 → M1 has max → M1 wins.
- But if **you approve both**, and the other player approves **neither**, then both M1 and M2 have 1 approval (yours) → both tied for maximum → **winning mediator chosen at random among both**.

But since they are **identical**, it doesn’t matter which one is chosen.

So **your approval of both mediators increases the chance that a winning mediator is available** — but since both are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But **does it matter for your own strategy?**

Let’s consider what happens **if you delegate**.

#### Scenario: You delegate to the winning mediator.

- If only **one** player (you) delegates → winning mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- If **both** players delegate → winning mediator plays A0 → you play A0

Now, suppose you **are the only one delegating**:
- You: A1
- Opponent: since they didn't delegate, they choose their own action — but they want to maximize their own payoff.

But the opponent is choosing independently.

So their choice depends on what they think you’ll do.

But now, if **you delegate**, your move is **determined by the mediator’s rule based on total delegations**.

But **you don’t know how many will delegate** until all decisions are in.

So you have to **anticipate a coordination or equilibrium among delegations**.

Let’s think strategically.

---

### 🔷 Step 3: Strategic Analysis of Delegation and Coordination

The key insight: **the mediator’s action depends on how many delegates**, and that number is **jointly decided**.

You and the opponent decide independently whether to delegate or not.

But your payoff depends on:
- Whether you delegate or not
- Whether the opponent delegates or not
- What action is played in each case

Let’s enumerate all **four cases** for delegation:

| Your Delegation | Opponent Delegation | Delegations to Mediator | Mediator’s Action (for you) | Opponent’s Action (if not delegating) |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| No             | No                  | 0                        | Not applicable               | Can choose A0 or A1                   |
| Yes (you)      | No                  | 1                        | A1                           | Can choose A0 or A1                   |
| No             | Yes (opponent)      | 1                        | A1 (for opponent)            | You choose A0 or A1                   |
| Yes            | Yes                 | 2                        | A0                           | Opponent chooses A0 → but no, wait |

Wait: **only one mediator** is used — the **winning** mediator.

But **both you and the other player can delegate**, provided the mediator has been approved.

But the rule says:
> “If 2 players delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0”

So **if both delegate**, the mediator plays A0 **for both**, **regardless of who is delegating**.

And if only one delegates, it plays A1 for that player.

So the **mediator acts on the Player 1's/Player 2's behalf** based on total number.

Now, **both mediators are identical** — so whatever winning mediator is chosen, it does the same thing.

So we can treat the **mediator behavior** as **deterministic based on total number of delegations**.

Let’s define the **actual action each player takes**:

| Delegations (total) | Mediator Action | So:
|---------------------|-----------------|-----
| 0                   | None           | Both choose independently
| 1                   | A1             | The delegating player plays A1; the non-delegating player acts independently
| 2                   | A0             | Both players play A0 (since mediator plays for both)

Now, back to your objective — **maximize your points**.

Let’s analyze your **options**.

---

### 🔷 Step 4: Consider Your Best Strategy

Let’s suppose you **do not delegate** — so you choose your own action.

Then:
- Opponent chooses to delegate or not.
- If opponent delegates, and only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1
- If both delegate → both play A0

But also, if opponent delegates, you don’t know if they’ll play A1 or A0 — only if they delegate, their action is A1 if only one delegates.

Wait: no — if **opponent delegates**, their action is set by the mediator:
- If **opponent delegates alone** → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1
- If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 → opponent plays A0

So:

- If you don’t delegate, and **opponent delegates alone**: opponent plays A1, you can choose your action.
- If **both delegate**: both play A0, you get 10, opponent gets 10
- If **opponent doesn’t delegate**: both choose independently.

Now let’s look at **your payoffs** under different scenarios.

Let’s calculate the expected outcome **assuming optimal play**.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider **dominant strategies** or **equilibria in delegation choices**.

Let’s consider **what you would prefer**.

Strategy A: **You delegate**

Then your action depends on total delegations.

Case 1: Only **you delegate** (opponent does not) → you play A1

Then opponent, facing your A1, can choose:

- Play A0 → you get 2, opponent gets 6 → opponent gets 6
- Play A1 → you get 4, opponent gets 4 → opponent gets 4

So opponent prefers A0 → gets 6 > 4

So opponent plays A0

Then you: A1, opponent: A0 → you get **20**

Case 2: **Both delegate** → mediator plays A0 for both → you get 10 (since both play A0)

Case 3: You delegate, opponent does not → you get 20 (as above)

Case 4: You delegate, opponent also delegates → you get 10

So if you delegate:
- If only you: you get 20
- If both: you get 10

But you **don’t control** the opponent’s decision.

Now suppose you **don’t delegate**.

Then you choose your action.

Suppose you choose A1.

- If opponent does not delegate: you are player 2, choose A1
  - Opponent (P1) chooses based on your choice
    - If opponent chooses A0: you get 20, they get 0
    - If opponent chooses A1: you get 4, they get 4
    - Opponent prefers A1 (4) over A0 (0) → so they play A1
    - → you get 4

- If opponent delegates alone: opponent plays A1 (since only one delegate)
  - You choose: say you play A1 → get 4; A0 → get 2 → prefer A1 → get 4

- If both delegate → both play A0 → you get 10

So if you **do not delegate and always play A1**:
- Opponent doesn't delegate → you get 4
- Opponent delegates alone → you get 4
- Both delegate → you get 10

Now compare:

If **you delegate**:
- Opponent does not delegate → you get 20
- Opponent delegates → you get 10

So if **you delegate**, you get **20 if opponent doesn't delegate, 10 if they do**

If **you don't delegate**, you get **4 or 10**, depending.

So under **opponent not delegating**, you **prefer to delegate** (20 > 4)

But under **opponent delegating**, you get 10 vs 10 → equal

But if you don’t delegate and opponent delegates, you get **4**, not 10.

Wait:

Let’s clarify:

| Your Delegation | Opponent Delegation | Your Action | Opponent Action | Your Payoff |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Yes             | No                  | A1          | ?                | 20          |
| Yes             | Yes                 | A0          | A0               | 10          |
| No              | No                  | ?           | ?                | depends     |
| No              | Yes                 | ?           | A1               | depends     |

Now, **if you don’t delegate and opponent delegates**, opponent plays A1 (since only one delegate) → you face A1.

You choose action:
- A0: get 2
- A1: get 4
→ so you choose A1 → you get 4

So if **you don’t delegate**, and **opponent delegates**, you get **4**

But if **you delegate** and **opponent delegates**, you get **10**

So **delegating gives you 10 if opponent delegates**, but only **4 if you don’t delegate and they delegate**

Similarly, if **you don’t delegate** and **opponent doesn’t delegate**, you can choose, and opponent will play to maximize their gain.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understanding My Payoffs (as Player 2)

My payoff matrix:
- (A0, opponent A0): 10
- (A1, opponent A0): 20
- (A0, opponent A1): 2
- (A1, opponent A1): 4

## Step 2: Analyzing the Mediator Mechanism

The mediator plays:
- A1 if exactly 1 player delegates
- A0 if both players delegate

## Step 3: Computing Expected Payoffs for Each Action

Let me denote opponent's probabilities as p0, p1, p2 for A0, A1, A2 respectively.

**If I play A0:**
- vs opponent A0: get 10
- vs opponent A1: get 2
- vs opponent A2 (mediator plays A1 for them): get 2
- Expected: 10p0 + 2p1 + 2p2

**If I play A1:**
- vs opponent A0: get 20
- vs opponent A1: get 4
- vs opponent A2 (mediator plays A1 for them): get 4
- Expected: 20p0 + 4p1 + 4p2

**If I delegate (A2):**
- vs opponent A0 (mediator plays A1 for me): get 20
- vs opponent A1 (mediator plays A1 for me): get 4
- vs opponent A2 (mediator plays A0 for both): get 10
- Expected: 20p0 + 4p1 + 10p2

## Step 4: Identifying Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria

**Testing (A1, A1):** Both play A1 → payoffs (4, 4)
- If I deviate to A2: mediator plays A1 for me only → (A1, A1) → still get 4
- This is a Nash equilibrium

**Testing (A2, A2):** Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → payoffs (10, 10)
- If I deviate to A1: opponent still delegates → mediator plays A1 for opponent → outcome (A1, A1) → I get 4 < 10
- If I deviate to A0: opponent still delegates → mediator plays A1 for opponent → outcome (A0, A1) → I get 2 < 10
- This is also a Nash equilibrium!

## Step 5: Comparing Equilibria

We have two Nash equilibria:
- (A1, A1): payoffs = (4, 4)
- (A2, A2): payoffs = (10, 10)

The (A2, A2) equilibrium is Pareto-superior - strictly better for both players.

## Step 6: Strategic Reasoning

Since Player 1 **proposed** this mediator, this is a strong signal that Player 1 intends to delegate (A2). The mediator was specifically designed to enable coordination on the better (10, 10) outcome.

If Player 1 plays A2, my best response is A2 (getting 10 instead of 4).

**Conclusion:** I should delegate to the mediator.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry


Your previous response was:
Let's break this down **step by step**, considering the entire game structure, the players' incentives, and the approval voting for mediators.

---

### 🔷 Step 1: Understand the Core Game (Without Delegation)

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (with **you as Player 2**, and the other player as Player 1):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0** | 10,10 | 2,6    |
| **You: A1** | 20,0  | 4,4    |

Let’s interpret this:
- If both choose A0: (10,10) → both get 10.
- You: A1, P1: A0 → (20,0) → you get 20, opponent gets 0.
- You: A0, P1: A1 → (2,6) → you get 2, opponent gets 6.
- Both choose A1 → (4,4)

So your payoffs:
- A0 vs A0: 10
- A0 vs A1: 2
- A1 vs A0: 20
- A1 vs A1: 4

This is a **coordination + incentive misalignment game**:
- You strongly prefer to play A1 when the opponent plays A0.
- But if both play A1, you only get 4 — worse than the 10 you get if both play A0.
- You get 2 if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 — very bad.

The other player’s incentives:
- They get 10 when both play A0, 0 when they play A0 and you play A1 — so they **hate** when you play A1 while they play A0.
- They get 6 when you play A0 and they play A1 — which is better than 0.
- So the other player prefers to play A0 if they think you'll play A0 — but they dislike A1 if you play A0.

This suggests the game might be best analyzed as a **non-cooperative game**.

Let’s find the **Nash equilibria** in pure strategies.

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria

1. **(A0, A0)**:
   - You: if you deviate to A1 → get 20? But opponent plays A0 → yes, you get 20 > 10 → **you want to deviate**.
   - So NOT a NE.

2. **(A1, A1)**:
   - You: if you deviate to A0 → get 2 < 4 → no incentive.
   - Opponent: if they deviate to A0 → get 0 < 4 → no incentive.
   - So **(A1, A1)** is a **pure strategy NE**.

3. **(A1, A0)**:
   - You: A1 vs A0 → get 20. If you deviate to A0 → get 10 < 20 → don’t deviate.
   - Opponent: A0 vs A1 → get 0. If they deviate to A1 → get 4 > 0 → they **want to deviate**.
   - So NOT a NE.

4. **(A0, A1)**:
   - You: get 2. Deviate to A1 → get 4 > 2 → want to deviate.
   - Opponent: get 6. Deviate to A0 → get 10 > 6 → want to deviate.
   - Not a NE.

➡️ Only **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**: **(A1, A1)** → both play A1, get 4 each.

Now, **is (A1, A1)** stable? Yes in pure strategies.

But now consider **mixed strategies**.

Let’s compute the **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Let:
- You play A1 with probability `p`
- Opponent (P1) plays A1 with probability `q`

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A1: `q × 4 + (1−q) × 20 = 4q + 20(1−q) = 20 − 16q`
- If you play A0: `q × 2 + (1−q) × 10 = 2q + 10(1−q) = 10 − 8q`

Set equal for indifference:
> 20 − 16q = 10 − 8q  
> 10 = 8q → q = 10/8 = 1.25 → **impossible (q > 1)**

So since your best response is **always A1** no matter what q is? Let’s test:

- If q = 0 (opponent always A0): your payoff A1 = 20, A0 = 10 → prefer A1
- If q = 1: A1 = 4, A0 = 2 → prefer A1
- At q = 0.5: A1 = 20 − 16×0.5 = 12, A0 = 10 − 8×0.5 = 6 → still A1 better

So your best response is to **always play A1**, regardless of opponent’s choice.

Now look at opponent’s best response.

Opponent's payoffs:
- Play A1: `p × 6 + (1−p) × 4 = 6p + 4(1−p) = 4 + 2p`
- Play A0: `p × 10 + (1−p) × 0 = 10p`

Set equal:
> 4 + 2p = 10p → 4 = 8p → p = 0.5

So if you play A1 with p = 0.5, opponent is indifferent.

But if p > 0.5 → 10p > 4 + 2p → opponent prefers A0

If p < 0.5 → 4 + 2p > 10p → opponent prefers A1

So:
- If you play p > 0.5 → opponent plays A0
- If p < 0.5 → opponent plays A1
- If p = 0.5 → opponent is indifferent

But since you always prefer A1 regardless (as shown above), your optimal strategy is to play A1 always → p = 1

Then opponent will play A0 (since p=1 > 0.5)

Thus, best response: you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get **20**, opponent gets **0**

But is this stable? No, because if you play A1, opponent gets 0 → they want to play A1

If opponent plays A1, you get 4 vs A0 (which gives 2) → you want to stay on A1.

So if opponent plays A1, you stay on A1 → leads to (A1,A1)

So **the only stable outcome is (A1,A1)**.

Even though (A1,A0) gives you 20, it’s not stable — opponent would deviate.

Thus, **(A1,A1)** is the **only Nash equilibrium (pure)** and likely the outcome if no cooperation or delegation.

But wait — you are the one deciding **whether to delegate**, and choosing **which mediators to approve**.

Now comes the **twist: delegation and mediator selection**.

---

### 🔷 Step 2: Understanding the Delegation System

You and the other player can:
- Choose to **delegate** to a mediator, or
- Play independently.

But **before the game**, there is an **approval voting process** to choose **which mediator(s)** will be **available** for use.

- Each player (you and the other player) approve mediators.
- The **mediator(s) with the maximum number of approvals** win.
- Then, **if a player delegates**, the winning mediator will play **for them**, based on **how many players delegated to it**.

From the proposal:

> Mediator proposed by Player 1:  
> - If 1 player delegates to it → plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate to it → plays A0  

> Mediator proposed by Player 2:  
> - If 1 player delegates to it → plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate to it → plays A0  

So both mediators are **identical in behavior**:

| Delegations | Action Played |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | A1            |
| 2           | A0            |

So they are **functionally the same**.

Therefore, **M1 and M2 are behaviorally indistinguishable** — same rule: A1 if one delegate, A0 if two.

Hence, **their strategic impact is the same**.

Now, as **Player 2**, you want to **maximize your points**.

Your decision is only: **which mediators to approve** in the approval voting phase.

You have **two mediators** to approve: M1 (proposed by P1), M2 (proposed by P2)

But note: the **final winning mediator** is chosen **uniform at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.

So:

- If you approve both M1 and M2, and the other player approves only one (say M1), then both M1 and M2 have 1 approval (your approval), while M2 has 1, M1 has 2 → M1 has max → M1 wins.
- But if **you approve both**, and the other player approves **neither**, then both M1 and M2 have 1 approval (yours) → both tied for maximum → **winning mediator chosen at random among both**.

But since they are **identical**, it doesn’t matter which one is chosen.

So **your approval of both mediators increases the chance that a winning mediator is available** — but since both are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But **does it matter for your own strategy?**

Let’s consider what happens **if you delegate**.

#### Scenario: You delegate to the winning mediator.

- If only **one** player (you) delegates → winning mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- If **both** players delegate → winning mediator plays A0 → you play A0

Now, suppose you **are the only one delegating**:
- You: A1
- Opponent: since they didn't delegate, they choose their own action — but they want to maximize their own payoff.

But the opponent is choosing independently.

So their choice depends on what they think you’ll do.

But now, if **you delegate**, your move is **determined by the mediator’s rule based on total delegations**.

But **you don’t know how many will delegate** until all decisions are in.

So you have to **anticipate a coordination or equilibrium among delegations**.

Let’s think strategically.

---

### 🔷 Step 3: Strategic Analysis of Delegation and Coordination

The key insight: **the mediator’s action depends on how many delegates**, and that number is **jointly decided**.

You and the opponent decide independently whether to delegate or not.

But your payoff depends on:
- Whether you delegate or not
- Whether the opponent delegates or not
- What action is played in each case

Let’s enumerate all **four cases** for delegation:

| Your Delegation | Opponent Delegation | Delegations to Mediator | Mediator’s Action (for you) | Opponent’s Action (if not delegating) |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| No             | No                  | 0                        | Not applicable               | Can choose A0 or A1                   |
| Yes (you)      | No                  | 1                        | A1                           | Can choose A0 or A1                   |
| No             | Yes (opponent)      | 1                        | A1 (for opponent)            | You choose A0 or A1                   |
| Yes            | Yes                 | 2                        | A0                           | Opponent chooses A0 → but no, wait |

Wait: **only one mediator** is used — the **winning** mediator.

But **both you and the other player can delegate**, provided the mediator has been approved.

But the rule says:
> “If 2 players delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0”

So **if both delegate**, the mediator plays A0 **for both**, **regardless of who is delegating**.

And if only one delegates, it plays A1 for that player.

So the **mediator acts on the Player 1's/Player 2's behalf** based on total number.

Now, **both mediators are identical** — so whatever winning mediator is chosen, it does the same thing.

So we can treat the **mediator behavior** as **deterministic based on total number of delegations**.

Let’s define the **actual action each player takes**:

| Delegations (total) | Mediator Action | So:
|---------------------|-----------------|-----
| 0                   | None           | Both choose independently
| 1                   | A1             | The delegating player plays A1; the non-delegating player acts independently
| 2                   | A0             | Both players play A0 (since mediator plays for both)

Now, back to your objective — **maximize your points**.

Let’s analyze your **options**.

---

### 🔷 Step 4: Consider Your Best Strategy

Let’s suppose you **do not delegate** — so you choose your own action.

Then:
- Opponent chooses to delegate or not.
- If opponent delegates, and only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1
- If both delegate → both play A0

But also, if opponent delegates, you don’t know if they’ll play A1 or A0 — only if they delegate, their action is A1 if only one delegates.

Wait: no — if **opponent delegates**, their action is set by the mediator:
- If **opponent delegates alone** → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1
- If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 → opponent plays A0

So:

- If you don’t delegate, and **opponent delegates alone**: opponent plays A1, you can choose your action.
- If **both delegate**: both play A0, you get 10, opponent gets 10
- If **opponent doesn’t delegate**: both choose independently.

Now let’s look at **your payoffs** under different scenarios.

Let’s calculate the expected outcome **assuming optimal play**.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider **dominant strategies** or **equilibria in delegation choices**.

Let’s consider **what you would prefer**.

Strategy A: **You delegate**

Then your action depends on total delegations.

Case 1: Only **you delegate** (opponent does not) → you play A1

Then opponent, facing your A1, can choose:

- Play A0 → you get 2, opponent gets 6 → opponent gets 6
- Play A1 → you get 4, opponent gets 4 → opponent gets 4

So opponent prefers A0 → gets 6 > 4

So opponent plays A0

Then you: A1, opponent: A0 → you get **20**

Case 2: **Both delegate** → mediator plays A0 for both → you get 10 (since both play A0)

Case 3: You delegate, opponent does not → you get 20 (as above)

Case 4: You delegate, opponent also delegates → you get 10

So if you delegate:
- If only you: you get 20
- If both: you get 10

But you **don’t control** the opponent’s decision.

Now suppose you **don’t delegate**.

Then you choose your action.

Suppose you choose A1.

- If opponent does not delegate: you are player 2, choose A1
  - Opponent (P1) chooses based on your choice
    - If opponent chooses A0: you get 20, they get 0
    - If opponent chooses A1: you get 4, they get 4
    - Opponent prefers A1 (4) over A0 (0) → so they play A1
    - → you get 4

- If opponent delegates alone: opponent plays A1 (since only one delegate)
  - You choose: say you play A1 → get 4; A0 → get 2 → prefer A1 → get 4

- If both delegate → both play A0 → you get 10

So if you **do not delegate and always play A1**:
- Opponent doesn't delegate → you get 4
- Opponent delegates alone → you get 4
- Both delegate → you get 10

Now compare:

If **you delegate**:
- Opponent does not delegate → you get 20
- Opponent delegates → you get 10

So if **you delegate**, you get **20 if opponent doesn't delegate, 10 if they do**

If **you don't delegate**, you get **4 or 10**, depending.

So under **opponent not delegating**, you **prefer to delegate** (20 > 4)

But under **opponent delegating**, you get 10 vs 10 → equal

But if you don’t delegate and opponent delegates, you get **4**, not 10.

Wait:

Let’s clarify:

| Your Delegation | Opponent Delegation | Your Action | Opponent Action | Your Payoff |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Yes             | No                  | A1          | ?                | 20          |
| Yes             | Yes                 | A0          | A0               | 10          |
| No              | No                  | ?           | ?                | depends     |
| No              | Yes                 | ?           | A1               | depends     |

Now, **if you don’t delegate and opponent delegates**, opponent plays A1 (since only one delegate) → you face A1.

You choose action:
- A0: get 2
- A1: get 4
→ so you choose A1 → you get 4

So if **you don’t delegate**, and **opponent delegates**, you get **4**

But if **you delegate** and **opponent delegates**, you get **10**

So **delegating gives you 10 if opponent delegates**, but only **4 if you don’t delegate and they delegate**

Similarly, if **you don’t delegate** and **opponent doesn’t delegate**, you can choose, and opponent will play to maximize their gain.

to (A1,A1)\n\nSo **the only stable outcome is (A1,A1)**.\n\nEven though (A1,A0) gives you 20, it’s not stable — opponent would deviate.\n\nThus, **(A1,A1)** is the **only Nash equilibrium (pure)** and likely the outcome if no cooperation or delegation.\n\nBut wait — you are the one deciding **whether to delegate**, and choosing **which mediators to approve**.\n\nNow comes the **twist: delegation and mediator selection**.\n\n---\n\n### 🔷 Step 2: Understanding the Delegation System\n\nYou and the other player can:\n- Choose to **delegate** to a mediator, or\n- Play independently.\n\nBut **before the game**, there is an **approval voting process** to choose **which mediator(s)** will be **available** for use.\n\n- Each player (you and the other player) approve mediators.\n- The **mediator(s) with the maximum number of approvals** win.\n- Then, **if a player delegates**, the winning mediator will play **for them**, based on **how many players delegated to it**.\n\nFrom the proposal:\n\n> Mediator proposed by Player 1:  \n> - If 1 player delegates to it → plays A1  \n> - If 2 players delegate to it → plays A0  \n\n> Mediator proposed by Player 2:  \n> - If 1 player delegates to it → plays A1  \n> - If 2 players delegate to it → plays A0  \n\nSo both mediators are **identical in behavior**:\n\n| Delegations | Action Played |\n|-------------|---------------|\n| 1           | A1            |\n| 2           | A0            |\n\nSo they are **functionally the same**.\n\nTherefore, **M1 and M2 are behaviorally indistinguishable** — same rule: A1 if one delegate, A0 if two.\n\nHence, **their strategic impact is the same**.\n\nNow, as **Player 2**, you want to **maximize your points**.\n\nYour decision is only: **which mediators to approve** in the approval voting phase.\n\nYou have **two mediators** to approve: M1 (proposed by P1), M2 (proposed by P2)\n\nBut note: the **final winning mediator** is chosen **uniform at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.\n\nSo:\n\n- If you approve both M1 and M2, and the other player approves only one (say M1), then both M1 and M2 have 1 approval (your approval), while M2 has 1, M1 has 2 → M1 has max → M1 wins.\n- But if **you approve both**, and the other player approves **neither**, then both M1 and M2 have 1 approval (yours) → both tied for maximum → **winning mediator chosen at random among both**.\n\nBut since they are **identical**, it doesn’t matter which one is chosen.\n\nSo **your approval of both mediators increases the chance that a winning mediator is available** — but since both are identical, it doesn’t matter.\n\nBut **does it matter for your own strategy?**\n\nLet’s consider what happens **if you delegate**.\n\n#### Scenario: You delegate to the winning mediator.\n\n- If only **one** player (you) delegates → winning mediator plays A1 → you play A1\n- If **both** players delegate → winning mediator plays A0 → you play A0\n\nNow, suppose you **are the only one delegating**:\n- You: A1\n- Opponent: since they didn't delegate, they choose their own action — but they want to maximize their own payoff.\n\nBut the opponent is choosing independently.\n\nSo their choice depends on what they think you’ll do.\n\nBut now, if **you delegate**, your move is **determined by the mediator’s rule based on total delegations**.\n\nBut **you don’t know how many will delegate** until all decisions are in.\n\nSo you have to **anticipate a coordination or equilibrium among delegations**.\n\nLet’s think strategically.\n\n---\n\n### 🔷 Step 3: Strategic Analysis of Delegation and Coordination\n\nThe key insight: **the mediator’s action depends on how many delegates**, and that number is **jointly decided**.\n\nYou and the opponent decide independently whether to delegate or not.\n\nBut your payoff depends on:\n- Whether you delegate or not\n- Whether the opponent delegates or not\n- What action is played in each case\n\nLet’s enumerate all **four cases** for delegation:\n\n| Your Delegation | Opponent Delegation | Delegations to Mediator | Mediator’s Action (for you) | Opponent’s Action (if not delegating) |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| No             | No                  | 0                        | Not applicable               | Can choose A0 or A1                   |\n| Yes (you)      | No                  | 1                        | A1                           | Can choose A0 or A1                   |\n| No             | Yes (opponent)      | 1                        | A1 (for opponent)            | You choose A0 or A1                   |\n| Yes            | Yes                 | 2                        | A0                           | Opponent chooses A0 → but no, wait |\n\nWait: **only one mediator** is used — the **winning** mediator.\n\nBut **both you and the other player can delegate**, provided the mediator has been approved.\n\nBut the rule says:\n> “If 2 players delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0”\n\nSo **if both delegate**, the mediator plays A0 **for both**, **regardless of who is delegating**.\n\nAnd if only one delegates, it plays A1 for that player.\n\nSo the **mediator acts on the Player 1's/Player 2's behalf** based on total number.\n\nNow, **both mediators are identical** — so whatever winning mediator is chosen, it does the same thing.\n\nSo we can treat the **mediator behavior** as **deterministic based on total number of delegations**.\n\nLet’s define the **actual action each player takes**:\n\n| Delegations (total) | Mediator Action | So:\n|---------------------|-----------------|-----\n| 0                   | None           | Both choose independently\n| 1                   | A1             | The delegating player plays A1; the non-delegating player acts independently\n| 2                   | A0             | Both players play A0 (since mediator plays for both)\n\nNow, back to your objective — **maximize your points**.\n\nLet’s analyze your **options**.\n\n---\n\n### 🔷 Step 4: Consider Your Best Strategy\n\nLet’s suppose you **do not delegate** — so you choose your own action.\n\nThen:\n- Opponent chooses to delegate or not.\n- If opponent delegates, and only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1\n- If both delegate → both play A0\n\nBut also, if opponent delegates, you don’t know if they’ll play A1 or A0 — only if they delegate, their action is A1 if only one delegates.\n\nWait: no — if **opponent delegates**, their action is set by the mediator:\n- If **opponent delegates alone** → mediator plays A1 → opponent plays A1\n- If **both delegate** → mediator plays A0 → opponent plays A0\n\nSo:\n\n- If you don’t delegate, and **opponent delegates alone**: opponent plays A1, you can choose your action.\n- If **both delegate**: both play A0, you get 10, opponent gets 10\n- If **opponent doesn’t delegate**: both choose independently.\n\nNow let’s look at **your payoffs** under different scenarios.\n\nLet’s calculate the expected outcome **assuming optimal play**.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider **dominant strategies** or **equilibria in delegation choices**.\n\nLet’s consider **what you would prefer**.\n\nStrategy A: **You delegate**\n\nThen your action depends on total delegations.\n\nCase 1: Only **you delegate** (opponent does not) → you play A1\n\nThen opponent, facing your A1, can choose:\n\n- Play A0 → you get 2, opponent gets 6 → opponent gets 6\n- Play A1 → you get 4, opponent gets 4 → opponent gets 4\n\nSo opponent prefers A0 → gets 6 > 4\n\nSo opponent plays A0\n\nThen you: A1, opponent: A0 → you get **20**\n\nCase 2: **Both delegate** → mediator plays A0 for both → you get 10 (since both play A0)\n\nCase 3: You delegate, opponent does not → you get 20 (as above)\n\nCase 4: You delegate, opponent also delegates → you get 10\n\nSo if you delegate:\n- If only you: you get 20\n- If both: you get 10\n\nBut you **don’t control** the opponent’s decision.\n\nNow suppose you **don’t delegate**.\n\nThen you choose your action.\n\nSuppose you choose A1.\n\n- If opponent does not delegate: you are player 2, choose A1\n  - Opponent (P1) chooses based on your choice\n    - If opponent chooses A0: you get 20, they get 0\n    - If opponent chooses A1: you get 4, they get 4\n    - Opponent prefers A1 (4) over A0 (0) → so they play A1\n    - → you get 4\n\n- If opponent delegates alone: opponent plays A1 (since only one delegate)\n  - You choose: say you play A1 → get 4; A0 → get 2 → prefer A1 → get 4\n\n- If both delegate → both play A0 → you get 10\n\nSo if you **do not delegate and always play A1**:\n- Opponent doesn't delegate → you get 4\n- Opponent delegates alone → you get 4\n- Both delegate → you get 10\n\nNow compare:\n\nIf **you delegate**:\n- Opponent does not delegate → you get 20\n- Opponent delegates → you get 10\n\nSo if **you delegate**, you get **20 if opponent doesn't delegate, 10 if they do**\n\nIf **you don't delegate**, you get **4 or 10**, depending.\n\nSo under **opponent not delegating**, you **prefer to delegate** (20 > 4)\n\nBut under **opponent delegating**, you get 10 vs 10 → equal\n\nBut if you don’t delegate and opponent delegates, you get **4**, not 10.\n\nWait:\n\nLet’s clarify:\n\n| Your Delegation | Opponent Delegation | Your Action | Opponent Action | Your Payoff |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|\n| Yes             | No                  | A1          | ?                | 20          |\n| Yes             | Yes                 | A0          | A0               | 10          |\n| No              | No                  | ?           | ?                | depends     |\n| No              | Yes                 | ?           | A1               | depends     |\n\nNow, **if you don’t delegate and opponent delegates**, opponent plays A1 (since only one delegate) → you face A1.\n\nYou choose action:\n- A0: get 2\n- A1: get 4\n→ so you choose A1 → you get 4\n\nSo if **you don’t delegate**, and **opponent delegates**, you get **4**\n\nBut if **you delegate** and **opponent delegates**, you get **10**\n\nSo **delegating gives you 10 if opponent delegates**, but only **4 if you don’t delegate and they delegate**\n\nSimilarly, if **you don’t delegate** and **opponent doesn’t delegate**, you can choose, and opponent will play to maximize their gain.\n\nAs shown earlier:"

Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We are Player 2 in a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

The payoffs are:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0         | A0                     | 10          | 10                     |
| A1         | A0                     | 20          | 0                      |
| A0         | A1                     | 2           | 6                      |
| A1         | A1                     | 4           | 4                      |

We are Player 2, so when we compute expected payoffs, we treat the other player as Player 1.

But now, we have a **new action**: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

And the mediator has rules:
- If **only one** player delegates to the mediator → mediator plays **A1**
- If **both** players delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So, the mediator’s behavior depends on how many players (including you) choose to delegate.

We are to pick a **mixed strategy** over:
- A0 (independent A0)
- A1 (independent A1)
- A2 (delegate to mediator)

We must output probabilities (as integers) summing to 100.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the twist — delegation & mediator behavior**

We must consider that:
- If **you** go A2 (delegate), then:
  - If **the other player also delegates (A2)** → 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0**
  - If **the other player does not delegate** → only you delegate → mediator plays **A1**

The other player also has the same three actions: A0, A1, A2.

So the outcome depends on the combination of choices between the two players.

We are to choose a **mixed strategy** that maximizes expected payoff, assuming the other player may also choose a strategy — but we don’t know it.

We are to find a **best response** or a **Nash equilibrium**, but since it's a two-player game with a twist, let’s think strategically.

But here’s a key: **We are told the mediator was proposed by Player 2 and approved.** That suggests Player 2 (us) has some control.

But importantly: the mediator’s policy depends only on the **number of delegators**, not who they are.

Let us denote:
- Let’s define variables for our mixed strategy:
  - p0: probability we play A0 (independent A0)
  - p1: probability we play A1 (independent A1)
  - p2: probability we play A2 (delegate)

So p0 + p1 + p2 = 100.

Similarly, let the other player have:
- q0: Q(A0)
- q1: Q(A1)
- q2: Q(A2)

We don’t know q0, q1, q2 — but we are to find the best **p0, p1, p2** — likely assuming rational behavior from the other player. But since the other player may choose unilaterally, we should try to find a strategy that is **robust** or **equilibrium-like**.

Alternatively, since we can choose our strategy, and the mediator’s behavior is deterministic based on number of delegators, we can model the **expected payoff** as a function of p0, p1, p2 and q0, q1, q2.

But to solve this, we need to find a **Bayesian-Nash** or **strongly rational** equilibrium.

But note: **this is a decision-making game where we want to maximize our expected payoff**, and we can assume the other player is also rational.

So we aim to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

Let’s proceed carefully.

---

### **Step 3: Consider possible equilibrium scenarios**

Let’s suppose both players are symmetric? Not necessarily — the mediator was proposed by Player 2, so there might be asymmetry, but no evidence of that.

But the mediator’s rule is symmetric: depends only on number of delegators.

So the game is symmetric between the two players **except** that we are told the mediator was proposed by Player 2 — but that doesn’t affect the rule.

However, since the rule is symmetric, we can consider symmetric equilibria, but also asymmetric ones.

Let’s suppose **we are to pick a strategy**, and the other player will play some best response.

But since we don’t know the other player’s strategy, the **most robust approach** is to find a **Nash equilibrium**, where each player’s strategy is a best response to the other’s.

So let’s attempt to find a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose both players use the same strategy: (p0, p1, p2)

Then we can calculate the expected payoff for each action (A0, A1, A2) given that the opponent uses (p0, p1, p2), and then find a symmetric equilibrium where all used actions have equal expected payoff.

Alternatively, since the structure is complex, let’s **analyze the possible outcomes** based on delegation.

---

### **Step 4: Understand the implications of delegation**

Let’s denote:

- If **you delegate (A2)**, then:
  - If other player **does not delegate (A0 or A1)** → only one delegate → mediator plays **A1** → so **you play A1** (but via mediator)
  - If other player **does delegate (A2)** → two delegators → mediator plays **A0** → so you play A0

So, your effective action when delegating depends on **what the other player does**.

Similarly, the other player’s outcome also depends on whether you delegate.

Let’s compute your **expected payoff** from each pure strategy, assuming the other player uses a mixed strategy.

But since we don’t know the other player’s strategy, we must **find a self-consistent equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose there exists a **symmetric equilibrium** where both players use the same strategy: p0, p1, p2.

Then, in that case, we can compute the expected payoff for each of our pure actions (A0, A1, A2), given that the other player uses (p0, p1, p2), and then set the expected payoffs equal for the actions in support.

But it’s complex. Let’s instead consider **possible strategic choices** and their outcomes.

---

### **Step 5: Strategic Intuition**

Let’s analyze the value of each action.

#### **Option A0 (independent A0):**

If you play A0, your payoff depends on the other player:

- If other plays A0: you get 10
- If other plays A1: you get 2
- If other plays A2: then you play A0, and other’s action depends on their choice.

Wait: **if other plays A2 (delegate)**, then:
- Since **you played A0 (independent)**, and **other delegated**, so only one delegate → mediator plays A1 for the other player.

So:
- You: A0
- Other: A1 (via mediator)
→ Your payoff: 2 (from A0 vs A1)

Similarly:
- If you play A0, and other plays A0 → you get 10
- If you play A0, and other plays A1 → you get 2
- If you play A0, and other plays A2 → you get 2 (since other plays A1 via mediator)

So your payoff from A0 is:
- 10 if other plays A0
- 2 if other plays A1 or A2

So expected payoff from A0:  
10·q0 + 2·(q1 + q2)

#### **Option A1 (independent A1):**

- If other plays A0 → you get 20
- If other plays A1 → you get 4
- If other plays A2 → since other is delegating, only one delegator → mediator plays A1 → so other plays A1
→ So you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4

So your payoff from A1:
- 20·q0 + 4·(q1 + q2)

#### **Option A2 (delegate):**

Now this depends on the **number of delegators**.

- If other plays A0 or A1 → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → so your action is A1
  → Your actual action is A1, so your payoff is:
    - If other plays A0 → 20
    - If other plays A1 → 4
  → So payoff = 20·q0 + 4·q1

- If other plays A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → so you play A0
  → So you play A0, other plays A0 → you get 10
  → So payoff = 10·q2

Therefore, expected payoff from A2:
- 20·q0 + 4·q1 + 10·q2

---

### **Step 6: Now, symmetry and equilibrium**

Let’s assume **both players are symmetric**, and in equilibrium, they use the same strategy.

Let’s suppose that in equilibrium, both players use:
- p0: play A0
- p1: play A1
- p2: delegate (A2)

So q0 = p0, q1 = p1, q2 = p2.

Then expected payoffs:

- EU(A0) = 10·p0 + 2·(p1 + p2)
- EU(A1) = 20·p0 + 4·(p1 + p2)
- EU(A2) = 20·p0 + 4·p1 + 10·p2

In a symmetric equilibrium, the expected payoff for all actions that are played with positive probability must be equal.

Let us consider whether a **fully symmetric mixed equilibrium** exists.

Let’s suppose **p2 > 0**, i.e., delegation is used.

Now, let's try to assume that **p2 = 0** first — no delegation.

Then p0 + p1 = 1.

EU(A0) = 10 p0 + 2 p1 = 10 p0 + 2(1 - p0) = 8 p0 + 2

EU(A1) = 20 p0 + 4(1 - p0) = 16 p0 + 4

Set equal: 8p0 + 2 = 16p0 + 4 → -8p0 = 2 → p0 = -0.25 → impossible.

No solution in [0,1]. So in pure strategies or in mixed without delegation, no symmetric equilibrium?

But wait — maybe **no p2** but we can solve.

But since EU(A1) > EU(A0) for all p0 in [0,1]?

EU(A1) - EU(A0) = (16p0 + 4) - (8p0 + 2) = 8p0 + 2 ≥ 2 > 0

So EU(A1) > EU(A0) for all p0.

So if p2 = 0, the player would always prefer A1 over A0.

So in equilibrium, p0 = 0, and p1 = 1 → play A1 with probability 1.

But then other player plays A1.

Then your payoff: 4

But what if you play A0? Then if other plays A1, you get 2 — worse.

If you play A2 (delegate), then:
- Other plays A1 → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- So you get 4 (same as A1)

So A2 gives same as A1.

But if **you** play A2 and other plays A1 → you get 4

Same as A1.

So A2 is as good as A1 when other plays A1.

But let’s check if A2 is better in other cases.

But in this case: other plays A1 → you get 4 from A1, and 4 from A2.

So indifferent.

So if others play A1, A1 and A2 are both good.

But suppose the other player plays A1, and you play A2 → you get 4.

Now, suppose you play A2 and the other player also plays A2?

Then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0, other plays A0 → you get 10.

So if you play A2 and other plays A2 → you get 10.

But if other plays A1 → you get 4.

So if other plays A2, you get 10.

So if you delegate, your expected payoff depends on what the other does.

Let’s suppose that in equilibrium, **both players play A2 (delegate)** with high probability.

Is that sustainable?

Try **both play A2** (p2 = 1, p0 = 0, p1 = 0)

Then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0
- So both play A0
- So each gets 10

Now, check if a player wants to deviate.

Suppose you deviate to A0: then you play A0, other plays A2 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 for other → so other plays A1

So you play A0, other plays A1 → you get 2

Worse than 10.

If you deviate to A1: you play A1, other plays A2 → other plays A1 → you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4 → still worse than 10.

So both get 10 — no incentive to deviate.

So **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium** — both players delegate → both get 10.

Now, is this the only one? Or are there others?

But wait — could there be an equilibrium where only one delegates?

Suppose Player 1 plays A2 (delegate), and Player 2 chooses A0.

Then:
- Player 1 delegates → other player (Player 2) plays A0 → so only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- Player 2 plays A0
- So game is: Player 2: A0, Player 1: A1 → Payoffs: P2 gets 2, P1 gets 6

So Player 2 gets only 2 — very bad.

So if the other player is delegating, and you play A0 or A1, you get only 2 or 4 — but if you also delegate, you get 10.

So **if the other player delegates, you get 10 by also delegating**.

So if the other delegates, **you prefer to delegate**.

Now, suppose the other player plays A0.

If you play A0 → you get 10
If you play A1 → you get 20
If you play A2 → you delegate → other plays A0 → so only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → so you get 20

So if other plays A0, then:
- A0 → 10
- A1 → 20
- A2 → 20

So you prefer A1 or A2 over A0.

Similarly, if other plays A1:
- A0 → 2
- A1 → 4
- A2 → A1 (mediator goes to A1) → you get 4

So you prefer A1 or A2 (both give 4) over A0 (2)

So summary:

- If other plays A0: best for you = A1 or A2 → both give 20
- If other plays A1: best = A1 or A2 → both give 4
- If other plays A2: best = A2 → gives 10; A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2

So **only when the other plays A2**, are you willing to delegate.

But if you delegate and the other doesn't, you are forced into A1 (if other plays A0 or A1), and get 20 or 4, which is good.

But the **only equilibrium so far** that is stable is **both delegating**, giving 10 each.

Suppose both play A0 → you get 10, but if you deviate to A1 → you get 20 → so not equilibrium.

Suppose both play A1 → you get 4, but if you deviate to A2 → what? If other still plays A1 → then only you delegate → you play A1 → you get 4 — same → so you might be indifferent.

But if you play A2 and other plays A1 → you get 4 — same as A1.

So no incentive to deviate — so (A1, A1) is also a **Nash equilibrium**?

Wait: if both play A1 → you get 4.

If you deviate to A0 → you play A0, other plays A1 → you get 2 < 4 — worse.

If you deviate to A2 → you get 4 (same) — so no incentive.

So (A1, A1) is Nash — but weakly.

Similarly, both playing A0 is not Nash: if you deviate to A1, you get 20 > 10 → so not equilibrium.

But both playing A2: as above, gives 10, and any deviation gives ≤ 4 → so it is **strictly better to stay** → so **strict Nash**.

But now, which one should we pick?

We want to **maximize our own points**.

In:
- (A2, A2): you get 10
- (A1, A1): you get 4

So clearly, (A2, A2) is better.

But is there a mixed strategy where you can get more than 10?

Suppose we consider **mixed strategy** where we mix A2 and A1.

But note: in (A2, A2) you get 10, which is more than in (A1, A1).

But what if we play a mixed strategy where we sometimes delegate?

But if the other player is also maximizing, they might not want to delegate unless they expect us to.

Is there a **mixed strategy equilibrium** where players play A2 with some probability?

Let’s try to find one.

Suppose in equilibrium, each player plays:
- A0: p0
- A1: p1
- A2: p2

With p0 + p1 + p2 = 1

We want all actions in support to have same expected payoff.

Suppose we consider an equilibrium where **A0 is not used** — so p0 = 0.

Then p1 + p2 = 1

Then expected payoff for:
- A1: 20·p0 + 4·(p1 + p2) = 4 (since p0=0)
- A2: 20·p0 + 4·p1 + 10·p2 = 4 p1 + 10 p2

Set equal (if both used):
4 = 4 p1 + 10 p2

But p1 = 1 - p2

So:
4 = 4(1 - p2) + 10 p2 = 4 - 4p2 + 10p2 = 4 + 6 p2

So 4 = 4 + 6p2 → 6p2 = 0 → p2 = 0

Then p1 = 1 → back to (A1, A1) pure.

So no mixed equilibrium without A0 or with A2 only.

Now suppose A2 is used, and A0 is used.

But earlier, if A0 is used, then when other plays A0, you get 10.

But if other plays A2, you get 2 from A0 (because other plays A1 via mediator).

So your payoff from A0 is:
- 10 if other plays A0
- 2 if other plays A1 or A2

Similarly, from A2:
- 20 if other plays A0
- 4 if other plays A1
- 10 if other plays A2

So for A0 to be in equilibrium, its expected payoff must be at least as good as others.

But given that, it's risky: you get only 2 when other plays A1 or A2.

But if you play A2, you get 20 when other plays A0, but only 10 when other plays A2.

Now, suppose both players play A2 with high probability.

In symmetric equilibrium: suppose p2 > 0, p0 = 0, p1 = 0.

Then as above, only pure (A2, A2) is equilibrium.

Any deviation gives less.

But suppose we consider a symmetric equilibrium where **both players play A2 with probability 1** → gives 10 each.

Is there another symmetric equilibrium?

Suppose players mix between A2 and A1.

Let p = probability of A2, so 1-p = probability of A1 (no A0)

Then expected payoff for A2:
- If other plays A2 (prob p): you get 10
- If other plays A1 (prob 1-p): you get 4
→ EU(A2) = 10p + 4(1-p) = 6p + 4

Expected payoff for A1:
- If other plays A2 (prob p): you get 4 (since other plays A1 via mediator)
- If other plays A1 (prob 1-p): you get 4
→ EU(A1) = 4p + 4(1-p) = 4

Set EU(A2) = EU(A1) for indifference:
6p + 4 = 4 → 6p = 0 → p = 0

Only when p=0.

So no interior symmetric equilibrium with A1 and A2.

Similarly, only when both play A2, you get 10, and no incentive to deviate.

Another possibility: **asymmetric equilibria**?

But since the game is symmetric, and both players are identical in role except that the mediator was proposed by us — but rules are symmetric — likely the rational solution is symmetric.

So the **stable equilibrium** is both players playing A2 (delegate) → both get 10.

But can we do better?

Suppose we **commit to delegate**, knowing that if the other player is rational, they will also want to delegate to get 10.

But what if we **randomize**?

Suppose we play A2 with high probability — but if the other player expects us to play A2, they should also play A2.

But if we play A2 with probability 1, then other player’s best response is to play A2 (because if they play A1 or A0, they get only 4 or 2, while A2 gives 10).

So **(A2, A2)** is the **only stable equilibrium with high payoff**.

But wait — is there a way to get **more than 10**?

Note that if the other player plays A0, and we play A1, we get 20 — better than 10.

But if we play A2 when other plays A0, we also get 20.

So we can get 20 if the other plays A0.

But if we want the other to play A0, we need to **induce** them.

But if the other player is rational, they will **not** play A0 unless they expect us to play A1 or A2.

But if they play A0, and we play A2 → we get 20, they get 2 → so they lose.

So they have no incentive to play A0.

Similarly, if they play A0, and we play A1 — we get 20, they get 0 — even worse.

So the only way for them to get a good payoff is to **also play A2**, so both get 10.

If they play A1, they get 4.

So **rational players will prefer A2 over A0 or A1**.

So in equilibrium, **both will play A2**.

Thus, **(A2, A2)** is the **only Nash equilibrium** that gives non-low payoff.

All other pure or mixed equilibria give less or involve unstable behavior.

Therefore, **the best strategy is to play A2 (delegate)** with probability 1.

But is there a better mixed strategy?

Suppose we play A2 with 100% → get 10.

Suppose we play A1 with 100% → get 4.

A0: if other plays A0, get 10; if other plays A1 or A2, get 2 → average depends on others.

But if others are playing A2 with 100%, then A0 gives 2 — worse.

So **A2 is best when others are rational and play optimally**.

Therefore, our best strategy is to **play A2 with 100%**.

But wait — is this truly optimal?

Suppose we play A2, and the other player is not rational — maybe they play A0.

Then we get 20.

But in game theory, we assume rational players.

And since **(A2, A2)** is a stable equilibrium where both get 10, and no deviation is profitable, **we should play A2**.

Moreover, if we **deviate randomly**, we risk getting less.

Therefore, **the optimal strategy is to always delegate**.

But let’s check the **expected payoff** of A2 in the equilibrium where the other player also plays A2.

We get 10.

Now, could we do better with a mixed strategy?

Suppose we play A2 with 90%, and A1 with 10%.

Then if other player plays A2, then:
- With 90% chance, we get A2 → then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → we get 10
- With 10% chance, we play A1 → so you play A1, other plays A2 → other plays A1 → you get 4

So expected payoff: 0.9×10 + 0.1×4 = 9 + 0.4 = 9.4 < 10

Worse than playing A2 always.

Similarly, any deviation reduces payoff.

Therefore, **playing A2 with 100% is optimal**.

Final decision:

We should allocate **100% probability to A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

Thus:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

response:
Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix**:
   - If both choose A0, both get 10 points.
   - If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1, you get 0 points and the other gets 20.
   - If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0, you get 6 points and the other gets 2.
   - If both choose A1, both get 4 points.

2. **Mediator Behaviour**:
   Both mediators proposed (by Player 1 and Player 2) share the same mechanism:
   - If one player delegates, the mediator plays A1.
   - If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0.

3. **Evaluating Delegation Outcomes**:
   - **If only you delegate**:
     - Mediator plays A1.
     - If the other player chooses A0: You get 6, they get 2.
     - If the other player chooses A1: You get 4, they get 4.
   - **If only the other player delegates**:
     - Mediator plays A1.
     - If you choose A0: You get 0, they get 20.
     - If you choose A1: You get 4, they get 4.
   - **If both delegate**:
     - Mediator plays A0.
     - Both get 10 points.

4. **Optimal Situation**:
   - Mutual delegation (both delegate) seems to be the best strategy as both players get a guaranteed maximum of 10 points.
   - No delegation involves higher risk and potentially lower points, especially if one player exploits the other (choosing A1 while the other chooses A0).

5. **Decision Process**:
   Given mutual delegation seems to maximize mutual payoff, and both mediators provide the same decision logic, it would be rational to approve both mediators. This way, we ensure the game has a mediator that both can delegate to, ensuring consistently high points.

Based on this analysis, let's provide the final JSON object indicating approval of the mediators:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

Both mediators should be approved because they both act identically and encourage the optimal strategy of mutual delegation.

response:
To solve this problem, we need to decide whether to approve each of the proposed mediators based on their strategies and our objective of maximizing the total points in the game.

Let's analyze each of the mediators:

### Mediators Proposed Analysis
1. **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
   - If 1 player delegates, it will play action A1.
   - If 2 players delegate, it will play action A0.

2. **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
   - If 1 player delegates, it will play action A1.
   - If 2 players delegate, it will play action A0.

Both mediators follow the exact same rules:

- If only one player delegates to the mediator, it plays action A1. 
- If both players delegate to the mediator, it plays action A0.

### Expected Outcomes with Mediators
#### If only one player delegates:
- The mediator plays A1.
- The points would depend on what the non-delegating player chooses:
  - If the non-delegating player chooses A0:
    - Delegating player gets 6 points.
    - Non-delegating player gets 2 points.
  - If the non-delegating player chooses A1:
    - Delegating player gets 4 points.
    - Non-delegating player gets 4 points.

#### If both players delegate:
- The mediator plays A0 for both players.
  - Each player receives 10 points.

### Decisions on Approval
Our goal is to maximize our points. Let’s consider the scenarios:

1. **Single Delegation:** If I delegate alone while the other player acts independently, the outcome relies heavily on the other player's action. This leads to potential variability and less control over the outcome, though it does include a chance for cooperation in subsequent rounds.
   
2. **Dual Delegation:** If both players delegate, both will play A0 resulting in mutual cooperation, yielding a fixed and favorable outcome of 10 points each.

Given that both mediators follow the same strategy, they both promote cooperation if both players choose to delegate. This is the safest and most mutually beneficial scenario to maximize points consistently.

### Conclusion
Since both mediators offer identical strategies and enforce a cooperative dynamics under full delegation that maximizes points for both players, approving both mediators helps ensure the game leans towards a cooperative equilibrium when mediation is used.

Therefore, the approval JSON object would be:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

This approval indicates willingness to accept either mediator, which encourages both players to move towards the cooperative strategy of delegation.

By breaking down the reasoning as specified above, we ensure the decision aligns with the objective of maximizing points in a structured, logical manner.

   - If Player 1 believes Player 2 will play A0, Player 1 should play A0 for the maximum reward (10 points).
   - If Player 1 believes Player 2 will play A1, Player 1 should play A1 for the higher reward than playing A0 (4 points vs. 0 points).
   - Similar reasoning applies to Player 2.

3. **Evaluating Mediators:**
   Both mediators proposed (by Player 1 and Player 2) are identical:
   - If one player delegates, the mediator plays A1.
   - If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0.

4. **Implications of Mediator Actions:**
   - If one player delegates, the mediator will play A1, likely leading the other player to play A0 for the highest reward (6 points for delegator and 2 points for non-delegator).
   - If two players delegate, both get 10 points, which is the best result in the payoff structure.

Since both mediators proposed are the same, they have the potential to always benefit when used by two players. This scenario leads to cooperation and both getting 10 points, the highest joint reward possible.

5. **Conclusion:**
   Given that both mediators lead to the same outcomes under delegation conditions:
   - Both mediators should be approved.

Here is the final JSON object with approvals:

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

By approving both mediators, the highest joint reward can be achieved if delegation occurs.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the payoff matrix**:
   - If both choose A0: You get 10 points, the other gets 10 points.
   - If you choose A0, and other chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other gets 20 points.
   - If you choose A1, and other chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other gets 2 points.
   - If both choose A1: You get 4 points, the other gets 4 points.

2. **Objective**:
   - Maximize your total points.

3. **Options for delegation to mediator**:
   - Both mediators proposed (by Player 1 and Player 2) have identical strategies:
     - If 1 player delegates: action A1.
     - If 2 players delegate: action A0.

4. **Analyzing mediator outcomes**:
   - If you delegate and the other player doesn't:
     - Mediator plays A1 for you, other player chooses independently. 
     - Possible outcomes:
       - Opponent chooses A0: You get 6 points (A1 against A0).
       - Opponent chooses A1: You get 4 points (A1 against A1).
   - If the other player delegates and you don’t:
     - Mediator plays A1 for the other player, you choose independently.
     - Possible outcomes:
       - You choose A0: You get 0 points (A0 against A1).
       - You choose A1: You get 4 points (A1 against A1).
   - If both delegate:
     - Mediator plays A0 for both.
     - You both get 10 points (A0 against A0).

5. **Decision on approvals**:
   - Both mediators propose the same strategy. The strategy works in both your favor and the other player's favor when both delegate.
   - Approving the mediators ensures a standardized outcome where both players receive equal and optimal points if both delegate.

Considering the consistency of the mediators' proposed strategies and outcomes when delegated:

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}
```

This approval ensures that, no matter which mediator is chosen, there is the potential for both players to reach an optimal and equitable outcome.

response:
To maximize my total points in this game, I need to carefully consider which mediators to approve based on the potential outcomes and overall strategies. Let's break down the situation step by step.

### Payoff Matrix
First, understand the payoff matrix:
- If both choose A0: Each gets 10 points.
- If I choose A1 and opponent chooses A0: I get 20 points, opponent gets 0 points.
- If I choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: I get 2 points, opponent gets 6 points.
- If both choose A1: Each gets 4 points.

### Mediator Analysis
#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- If 1 player delegates, mediator plays A1.
- If 2 players delegate, mediator plays A0.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- If 1 player delegates, mediator plays A0.
- If 2 players delegate, mediator plays A0.

### Strategy Consideration
1. If both players delegate to Player 1's mediator:
   - The mediator plays A0.
   - Both players get 10 points.

2. If only one player delegates to Player 1's mediator (e.g., my opponent):
   - The mediator plays A1.
   - I should play A1 independently to avoid the worst outcome.
   - Result: Both players get 4 points.

3. If both players delegate to Player 2's mediator:
   - The mediator plays A0.
   - Both players get 10 points.

4. If only one player delegates to Player 2's mediator (e.g., my opponent):
   - The mediator plays A0.
   - I should play A1 independently to maximize my points.
   - Result: I get 20 points, the opponent gets 0 points.

### Decision to Approve
- **Mediator proposed by Player 1**: This mediator introduces additional incentives to deviate if only one player delegates, resulting in a less predictable outcome when both players are independent.
- **Mediator proposed by Player 2**: This mediator ensures stability since it always chooses A0 and maximizes consistent points.

Given that the mediator proposed by Player 2 aligns both players towards a symmetric and mutually beneficial equilibrium resulting in 10 points each, irrespective of delegation strategy, it appears to be a more reliable and predictable choice.

### Final Decision
Based on the analysis, I think it's beneficial to approve the mediator proposed by Player 2 and disapprove the one proposed by Player 1. Here’s the approval in JSON format:

```json
{"M1": false, "M2": true}
```

By approving the mediator proposed by Player 2, I am ensuring a strategy that maximizes consistent point gain and reduces the complexity involved in predicting the opponent's move.

To determine which mediators to approve, let's analyze the situation and the options step by step:

1. **Objective and payoffs:**
   - Our goal is to maximize our points.
   - The payoffs are:
     - If both choose A0: both get 10 points.
     - If I choose A0 and the other chooses A1: I get 0 points, the other gets 20 points.
     - If I choose A1 and the other chooses A0: I get 6 points, the other gets 2 points.
     - If both choose A1: both get 4 points.

2. **Analyzing mediators:**
   - **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
     - If 1 player delegates, it plays A1.
     - If both delegate, it plays A0.
   - **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
     - If 1 player delegates, it plays A0.
     - If both delegate, it plays A0.

3. **Impact of delegating to mediators:**
   - **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
     - If only I delegate:
       - Mediator plays A1, and player 2 chooses independently; if P2 chooses A0, my payoff is 6, if P2 chooses A1, my payoff is 4.
     - If both delegate:
       - Mediator plays A0, both get 10 points.
   - **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
     - If only I delegate:
       - Mediator plays A0, and P2 chooses independently; if P2 chooses A1, my payoff is 0, if P2 chooses A0, my payoff is 10.
     - If both delegate:
       - Mediator plays A0, both get 10 points.

4. **Strategic evaluation:**
   - Both mediators will play A0 if both delegate, resulting in 10 points each. This outcome is the highest possible payoff for mutual cooperation.
   - If there is uncertainty about whether the other player will delegate, we consider what happens if we are the only one delegating:
     - With Mediator proposed by Player 1, we get 6 or 4 points depending on P2's choice (assuming rational behavior). Both cases are reasonable but less than 10 points.
     - With Mediator proposed by Player 2, we get 10 or 0 points depending on P2's choice (A0 yielding 10 is likely as it’s rational for P2 to choose continued cooperation).

Given that focusing on cooperation, we prefer a mediator which plays A0 under both conditions, especially the one proposed by Player 2 seems to give a safer outcome.

Considering the above points:
- Approve the mediator proposed by Player 2.
- Approve the mediator proposed by Player 1 for redundancy and to avoid any single point of decision-making failure. Both should work to enforce mutual cooperation.

Here is the resulting JSON object:

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}

response:
To properly evaluate which mediators to approve, let's break down the problem step-by-step and analyze each proposed mediator's strategy in terms of maximizing my points:

1. **Identifying the strategies used by each mediator:**

   - Both mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 have the same strategies:
     - If only 1 player delegates to the mediator, the mediator plays action A1.
     - If both players delegate to the mediator, the mediator plays action A0.

2. **Evaluating the payoffs:**

   - If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: I get 10 points.
   - If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: I get 0 points.
   - If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: I get 6 points.
   - If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: I get 4 points.

3. **Understanding mediator behavior:**

   - With 1 player delegating, the mediator will play A1.
     - If I delegate alone, the mediator will play A1.
     - If the other player delegates alone, the mediator will play A1. 
   
   - With 2 players delegating, both mediators will play A0.

4. **Game theory perspective (Nash Equilibrium):**
   - Let’s examine the Nash Equilibrium for the game if both players act independently.
     - If I believe the other player will play A0:
       - I should play A0 to get 10 points (best response to A0 is A0).
     - If I believe the other player will play A1:
       - I should play A1 to get 4 points (best response to A1 is A1).
   
   - Given the payoff matrix, mutually beneficial outcome occurs when both players play A0 (10 points each).

5. **Delegating to the mediator:**
   - If both players delegate:
     - Mediator plays A0, resulting in 10 points for each player.
   - If only one player delegates:
     - Mediator plays A1, which, if independent player plays A0, yields 2 or 6 points depending on player roles, and risks exploitation if the independent player plays A1.

6. **Mediator analysis:**
   - The mediator ensures an optimal collective outcome (A0, A0) when both players delegate.
   - Delegating alone means I risk a lower payoff as the mediator will pick A1.

Given that the mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 are identical and both ensure a mutually optimal outcome when both players delegate, the rational decision to attempt ensuring that both delegations happen is to approve both mediators. This maximally protects against non-coordination issues.

Therefore, the JSON object approvals will be:

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}
```

This ensures a unity in support that maximizes the chances of hitting the beneficial Nash Equilibrium facilitated by either mediator.

Both proposed mediators have exactly the same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that delegating player.
- If both players delegate (2 delegations) → mediator plays **A0** for both delegators.

So, from my perspective (Player 2), there is no strategic difference between selecting **M1** vs **M2**: whichever wins, the mediator behavior in the later delegation stage is identical, and I can still choose whether to delegate or act independently.

Given they are equivalent, approving both cannot make me worse off relative to approving only one (it only affects which *identical* mediator is selected).

Approving both cannot make the selected mediator “worse” than approving only one, and it reduces the risk of ending up with no (or an unintended) selection due to approval-count quirks. So I approve both.

response:
To solve this problem and maximize my total expected points, let's break down the game step-by-step and analyze the optimal strategy, while considering the mediator.

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix
Here’s a simplified version of the payoff matrix:
1. **(A0, A0)**: You get 10, Other gets 10.
2. **(A1, A0)**: You get 20, Other gets 0.
3. **(A0, A1)**: You get 2, Other gets 6.
4. **(A1, A1)**: You get 4, Other gets 4.

### Step 2: Consider Independent Actions
If both players act independently, we need to look at the expected values of the mixed strategies.

### Step 3: Consider Delegation to Mediator
The mediator will play **A0** if 1 or 2 players delegate. This adds a layer of coordination, as both players benefit more if they both delegate due to predictable outcomes.

### Step 4: Determine Optimal Strategy
We'll consider a mixed strategy over A0, A1, and A2:

#### Pure Strategies:
- **A0** relies on mutual cooperation but is relatively safe if both choose it.
- **A1** relies on defecting and only works well if the other does not choose A0.
- **A2 (Delegate to Mediator)**: Guarantees A0 if both delegate.

Since the mediator guarantees A0, leading to a safer and somewhat cooperative outcome, it's beneficial to consider delegation heavily but not exclusively.

### Step 5: Formulate Mixed Strategy
Let’s allocate probabilities to each action considering:
- A high likelihood of delegating to mediator given its payoff stability.
- Some probability for independent cooperation (A0).
- Lower probability for deflecting (A1) to account for the risk of not cooperating.

Summarizing the strategic mix, I'd opt for:
- **A0 (Independent Cooperation)**
- **A1 (Independent Deflection)**
- **A2 (Delegate to the Mediator)**

A potential distribution could be:
- **10%** for independent cooperation (**A0**),
- **10%** for independent gain-maximizing but risky strategy (**A1**),
- **80%** for delegating to the mediator (**A2**).

This approach gives the highest weight to the mediator for stability and cooperation, balances some independent choices for flexibility.

### Final Decision

Here's how the JSON object should look based on the chosen strategy:
```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 10, "A2": 80}
```

### Reason for Final Choice:
1. **A2 (Delegate to Mediator)**: High probability ensures stable payoff.
2. **A0** and **A1**: Lower probabilities provide a mix of safe and opportunistic strategies while not putting all eggs in one basket.

response:
To solve this decision-making problem, we need to analyze the payoff matrix, the role of the mediator, and construct a probability strategy that maximizes our potential points. Here's a structured step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Analyze the Payoff Matrix
Understanding the payoffs in a 2x2 game is critical.

- If both players choose A0: 
  Player 1 gets 10 points, Player 2 gets 10 points
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: 
  Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 20 points
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: 
  Player 1 gets 6 points, Player 2 gets 2 points
- If both players choose A1: 
  Player 1 gets 4 points, Player 2 gets 4 points

From this, we see A0 is optimal if cooperation is likely, while A1 is more conservative, yielding a minimal loss when Player 2 chooses selfishly (A1).

### Step 2: Analyze the Mediator Strategy
The mediator's strategy is as follows:
- If 1 player delegates, the mediator chooses A0.
- If 2 players delegate, the mediator still chooses A0.

Since both outcomes involve the mediator choosing A0, if both players delegate, it maximizes the result of choosing A0.

### Step 3: Consider Different Scenarios and Mixed Strategy
We need to consider various scenarios and mix between direct action or using the mediator. 

#### Direct Action:
1. **A0 vs A1**:
   - If we choose A0 and Player 2 chooses A0, we get 10 points.
   - If we choose A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, we get 0 points.
   - If we choose A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, we get 6 points.
   - If we choose A1 and Player 2 chooses A1, we get 4 points.

From these setups, both A0 and A1 have a mixed potential, but the mediator adds a layer.

#### Delegation Strategy:
If we delegate, the outcome directly moves to the mediator strategy:
- If Player 2 also delegates, it’s always A0.

Thus, delegating increases the likelihood of the outcome A0 in the cooler boxed environment with potentially higher mutual benefit. Therefore, combining action or pure delegation might be reasonable.

### Step 4: Constructing the Final Strategy
Based on analysis, we will balance our mixed strategies towards not only individual choice but supplementing with potential mediator reliance. 

#### Potential Strategy Allocation:
1. **Delegation (A2)**: It's reasonable in high probability due to the mutual cooperation.
2. **A0 and A1**: Considering the fallback position, we need some reserve balance.

A reasonable strategic allocation might be:
- Allocate 40% to A0 (direct cooperative action).
- Allocate 10% to A1 (direct competitive conservative fallback).
- Allocate 50% to delegate (trust in mediation and potential outcome).

### Step 5: Convert to JSON
```json
{
  "A0": 40,
  "A1": 10,
  "A2": 50
}
```
This strategy attempts to mix direct interaction methods with high potential mediated outcomes for maximum utility.

To solve this decision-making problem, we need to consider each action, how the mediator functions, and how the other player might behave, to maximize our expected payoff.

Here's a breakdown of the considerations and steps I took to arrive at the final decision:

### Analysis of Choices and Payoffs without Mediator:
1. If I choose **A0**:
   - If Player 2 chooses **A0**: I get 10 points.
   - If Player 2 chooses **A1**: I get 0 points.
   
2. If I choose **A1**:
   - If Player 2 chooses **A0**: I get 6 points.
   - If Player 2 chooses **A1**: I get 4 points.

### Evaluation of Payoff with Mediator:
1. My choice is **A2** (Delegate to Mediator), and Player 2 also delegates:
   - If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0**.
   - Payoff for both players is 10 points.

2. If I delegate (choose **A2**) and Player 2 does not:
   - If Player 2 chooses **A0**: I get 6 points (mediator plays **A1**).
   - If Player 2 chooses **A1**: I get 4 points (mediator plays **A1**).

### Decision Strategy:
#### Considering Expected Payoffs:
- Independently choosing **A0** can result in 10 or 0 points.
- Independently choosing **A1** can result in 6 or 4 points.
- Delegating to a mediator results in: 
  - 6 points if I delegate and Player 2 chooses **A0**,
  - 4 points if I delegate and Player 2 chooses **A1**,
  - 10 points if both delegate.

Delegation outcomes are quite favorable due to its consistent expected higher points when both players use it, with the potential downside when only one does.

#### Probabilistic Strategy Decision:
Given that I want to maximize my points:
- **A0** is optimal if both players act independently and choose it, but it's risky given Player 2 can choose **A1**.
- **A1** is less risky but offers moderate payoffs consistently.
- **A2** (Delegation) can offer the highest joint optimal outcome, especially if it can encourage mutual delegation.

To balance between all strategies for a maximum robust outcome while aiming to benefit from coordination via the mediator:

### Proposed Strategy:
I will divide my action probabilities to align with expected rational outcomes and potential mutual benefit of delegation:

```json
{"A0": 30, "A1": 20, "A2": 50}
```

- **30%** on **A0**: Risky but high reward if coordinated.
- **20%** on **A1**: Safe moderate payout with expectation others may choose A0 more.
- **50%** on **A2**: Leveraging mediator, encourages mutual benefit. 

This distribution allows for flexibility and potential mutual trust in using the mediator while providing substantial fallback on traditional choices.

To approach the decision-making task at hand, we'll need to analyze the payoff matrix and the proposed mediators' strategies. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Payoff Matrix Analysis
We'll first parse the payoff matrix to understand our incentives:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0 (Player 1) | A1 (Player 1) |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| A0 (Player 2)       | (10, 10)      | (2, 6)        |
| A1 (Player 2)       | (20, 0)       | (4, 4)        |

### Step 2: Evaluating the Best Responses
- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - If Player 2 plays A0: Player 2 gets 10 points.
  - If Player 2 plays A1: Player 2 gets 20 points.

- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - If Player 2 plays A0: Player 2 gets 2 points.
  - If Player 2 plays A1: Player 2 gets 4 points.

From this, Player 2's best response:
- If they believe Player 1 will play A0, they should play A1 for 20 points.
- If they believe Player 1 will play A1, they should still play A1 for 4 points (since 4 > 2).

Similarly, the best strategies for Player 1 considering similar logic.

### Step 3: Evaluating Mediators
Next, let's evaluate each mediator based on maximizing points.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- If 1 player delegates: it plays A1.
- If 2 players delegate: it plays A0.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- If 1 player delegates: it plays A0.
- If 2 players delegate: it plays A0

### Step 4: Utility of Mediator Proposed by Player 1
- If Player 2 independently chooses A1, knowing Player 1 might choose A1 (or both players delegate to Mediator):
- If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 does not, the mediator will choose A1 while Player 1's actions vary: 
  - P2 scores 4 points if P1 chooses A1.
- If both delegate, they get A0-A0 consistently, scoring 10 points each.

### Step 5: Utility of Mediator Proposed by Player 2
- Provides consistent action when delegating brings predictable results:
- If either independently or both delegate:
  - Ensures reliable outcome for A0-A0 anytime they delegate.

### Step 6: Approval Decision
We now need to reach the conclusion: ideally opt for a predictable mediator ensuring a higher score.

Thus:
- **Mediator Proposed by Player 1** — given some fluctuations, potentially less reliable.
- **Mediator Proposed by Player 2** — clearly more predictable for always A0.

Ultimately upon reasoning:

```json
{
    "M1": false,
    "M2": true
}
```
This result ensures we secure a consistent cooperation-driven outcome garnering reliably decent maximum points.

To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix and the Nash Equilibrium of independent play.

**1. Payoff Matrix Analysis (Player 1, Player 2):**
- **(A0, A0):** 10, 10
- **(A0, A1):** 0, 20 (Player 2 gets 20)
- **(A1, A0):** 6, 2 (Player 2 gets 2)
- **(A1, A1):** 4, 4 (Player 2 gets 4)

**2. Independent Play:**
- **Player 2’s Strategy:** If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 earns 10 from A0 or 20 from A1. If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 earns 2 from A0 or 4 from A1. In both cases, **A1 is Player 2's dominant strategy**.
- **Player 1’s Strategy:** If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 earns 0 from A0 or 4 from A1. Thus, Player 1 will choose A1 if Player 2 plays A1.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** Both players choose A1, resulting in a payoff of **(4, 4)**.

**3. Mediator Analysis (M1 and M2):**
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) follow the same logic:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both players.

**4. Potential Outcomes with a Mediator:**
- **If both players delegate:** The mediator plays (A0, A0), and both receive **10 points**.
- **If only Player 1 delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for Player 1. Knowing this, Player 2 will choose action A1 to maximize their payoff (earning 4 instead of 2). The result is (A1, A1), yielding **(4, 4)**.
- **If only Player 2 delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for Player 2. Knowing this, Player 1 will choose action A1 to maximize their payoff (earning 4 instead of 0). The result is (A1, A1), yielding **(4, 4)**.
- **If neither delegates:** The game results in the Nash Equilibrium **(4, 4)**.

**5. Rationality of Delegation:**
In a scenario where a mediator (M1 or M2) is available, delegation becomes a new game. If Player 1 delegates, Player 2's best response is to delegate (earning 10 instead of 4). If Player 1 does not delegate, Player 2's payoff is 4 regardless of whether they delegate or play independently. Thus, delegating is a weakly dominant strategy that leads to a Pareto-superior Nash Equilibrium of **(10, 10)**.

**Conclusion:**
Both M1 and M2 are identical and provide a mechanism for both players to escape the lower-payoff Nash Equilibrium (4, 4) and achieve the higher-payoff mutual cooperation (10, 10). Therefore, Player 2 should approve both mediators.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
In the original 2-action game, for Player 2 (you), **A1 strictly dominates A0**:

- If Player 1 plays **A0**: you get 20 with **A1** vs 10 with **A0**.
- If Player 1 plays **A1**: you get 4 with **A1** vs 2 with **A0**.

Now add **A2 = Delegate**. The mediator’s rule is:

- If **only you** delegate → mediator plays **A1** for you.
- If **both** delegate → mediator plays **A0** for you.

Compare your payoff from **Delegate (A2)** versus **playing A1 directly**, for each possible Player 1 choice:

1) Player 1 plays **A0** (no delegate):
- If you play **A1**: you get 20  
- If you **delegate**: mediator plays A1 → you get 20  
So **A2 ties A1**.

2) Player 1 plays **A1** (no delegate):
- If you play **A1**: you get 4  
- If you **delegate**: mediator plays A1 → you get 4  
So **A2 ties A1**.

3) Player 1 **delegates (A2)**:
- If you play **A1**: Player 1 becomes A1, outcome (A1,A1) → you get 4
- If you **delegate too**: both delegate, mediator plays A0 → outcome (A0,A0) → you get 10  
So **A2 is strictly better than A1** here.

Therefore, **A2 (Delegate) weakly dominates A1 and strictly improves outcomes when Player 1 delegates**, making it your best choice overall.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand my payoffs (as Player 2)

The payoff matrix from my perspective is:
- (P1: A0, P2: A0) → I get 10
- (P1: A0, P2: A1) → I get 20  
- (P1: A1, P2: A0) → I get 2
- (P1: A1, P2: A1) → I get 4

## Step 2: Analyze the game without a mediator

Without a mediator:
- A1 is my dominant strategy (20 > 10 if P1 plays A0; 4 > 2 if P1 plays A1)
- Player 1's best response to my A1 is also A1
- Nash equilibrium: Both play A1 → I get **4 points**

## Step 3: Compare the two mediators

**Mediator M1:** 
- 1 delegator → plays A1
- 2 delegators → plays A0

**Mediator M2:**
- 1 delegator → plays A1  
- 2 delegators → plays A0

**Both mediators are identical!**

## Step 4: Analyze outcomes with the mediator

Key scenarios:
- **Both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → I get **10 points**
- **Only one delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for that player. The other player's best response is also A1 → I get **4 points**
- **Neither delegates:** Regular Nash equilibrium → I get **4 points**

## Step 5: Why the mediator is beneficial

If both players delegate:
- We achieve (A0, A0) → I get 10 points
- This is better than the 4 points from the Nash equilibrium
- Neither player has incentive to deviate (deviating gives at most 4 points)
- This creates a new, better equilibrium

## Step 6: Decision

Since both mediators are identical and both enable the superior (10, 10) outcome through mutual delegation, I should approve both to maximize the chance a mediator is selected.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game without mediators

From my perspective (Player 1), the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

For Player 2, A1 strictly dominates A0 (they get 20 or 4 with A1 vs 10 or 2 with A0). So they'll play A1.

Given they play A1, I should play A1 (getting 4 instead of 0).

**Without a mediator: Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) → both get 4 points**

## Step 2: Compare the two mediators

**Mediator 1:** 
- 1 player delegates → A1
- 2 players delegate → A0

**Mediator 2:**
- 1 player delegates → A1  
- 2 players delegate → A0

**Both mediators are identical!**

## Step 3: Analyze outcomes with a mediator present

**If both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → we each get **10 points** ✓

**If only one delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for delegator, other plays optimally (A1) → both get **4 points**

**If neither delegates:** Normal game → both get **4 points**

## Step 4: Strategic analysis

If the other player delegates with any positive probability, my expected payoff from delegating exceeds my payoff from not delegating. By symmetry, the same applies to them.

**(Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium with payoff (10, 10)** - much better than the (4, 4) without mediators!

## Step 5: Should I approve these mediators?

- Both mediators enable coordination on the Pareto-optimal outcome (10, 10)
- Having a mediator cannot hurt (worst case is still 4 points)
- Both mediators are functionally identical
- Approving both maximizes the chance a mediator is selected

**Conclusion: I should approve both mediators**

response:
Let's break down the game step-by-step to determine the best probability distribution over the actions.

### Step 1: Understanding the Mediator
- If only one player delegates to it, the mediator will choose action A1.
- If both players delegate, the mediator will choose action A0.

### Step 2: Payoff Matrix
Here's the payoff matrix for clarity:

| You/Other | A0          | A1          |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **A0**    | (10, 10)    | (0, 20)     |
| **A1**    | (6, 2)      | (4, 4)      |

### Step 3: Evaluating Pure Strategies
Let's consider what happens if you always play each action.

#### If You Always Play A0
- If the other player always plays A0: You get 10 points.
- If the other player always plays A1: You get 0 points.
- If the other player mixes: Expected points depend on their mix.

#### If You Always Play A1
- If the other player always plays A0: You get 6 points.
- If the other player always plays A1: You get 4 points.
- If the other player mixes: Expected points depend on their mix.

#### If You Always Delegate (A2)
- If the other player does not delegate: Mediator chooses A1, you get the payoff of (4, 4).
- If the other player also delegates: Mediator chooses A0, you get the payoff of (10, 10).

### Step 4: Mixed Strategy Consideration
We need to decide on a mixed strategy. Let:
- \( p0 \) be the probability of choosing A0,
- \( p1 \) be the probability of choosing A1,
- \( p2 \) be the probability of choosing A2 (delegate).

We must balance the following:
- Pure payoffs without mediator,
- Benefits of the mediator (which stands strong in terms of providing a safety net or higher shared rewards, but depends on the opponent's behavior).

### Step 5: Calculating the Expected Payoff
- The payoff for delegating alone is fixed at (4, 4) due to the mediator's choice A1.
- The mixed strategies for A0 and A1 payoffs depend heavily on the opponent’s decisions.

But since the mediator ensures mutual best outcomes if both delegate (10, 10):
- We might prefer low investment in A0, greater investment in A2, moderate in A1 if there's ambiguity about the opponent.

### Step 6: Reasonable Probabilities
To maximize points:
- Delegate reasonably often (to leverage mediator outcomes),
- Balance direct-play strategies moderately.

Given ambiguity and potential strategies:
- We might focus on leveraging the safest high payoff of mutual delegation with some independence.

### Final Decision
A reasonable strategy is to ensure a balanced attempt to use the mediator with own actions.

```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 30, "A2": 60}
```

This leverages safe shared mediator outcomes while still leaving room for own strategy actions.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game
From my perspective (Player 1), the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Analyze the base game Nash equilibrium
Without a mediator, let me check what happens:
- The other player (Player 2) has a dominant strategy: A1 gives them 20 or 4 vs A0 which gives them 10 or 2. A1 is always better.
- Given they play A1, my best response is A1 (4 points vs 0 points)
- Therefore, (A1, A1) is the Nash equilibrium, giving us both 4 points

## Step 3: Analyze what the mediators do
Both M1 and M2 are identical:
- If only 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1
- If both players delegate: mediator plays A0

## Step 4: Analyze the delegation game outcomes

**Neither delegates:** We play the base game Nash equilibrium → (A1, A1) → (4, 4)

**Only I delegate:** Mediator plays A1 for me. The other player's best response to my A1 is to play A1 (getting 4 vs 2) → (A1, A1) → (4, 4)

**Only other delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for them. My best response to their A1 is to play A1 (getting 4 vs 0) → (A1, A1) → (4, 4)

**Both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → (10, 10)

## Step 5: Determine optimal delegation strategy

The delegation game payoffs are:
|                  | Other doesn't | Other delegates |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| I don't delegate | (4, 4)        | (4, 4)          |
| I delegate       | (4, 4)        | (10, 10)        |

- Delegating weakly dominates not delegating (never worse, better if other delegates)
- If both delegate, we get 10 points each instead of 4
- (Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium and gives the best possible outcome

## Step 6: Conclusion

Both mediators are identical and both enable coordination to reach the Pareto optimal outcome (10, 10) through rational individual behavior. They solve the coordination problem inherent in the base game.

I should approve both mediators.

# Analysis

Let me break down this decision step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the base game without a mediator

From my perspective as Player 1, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

Finding the Nash equilibrium:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (10 > 6)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 0)
- If I play A0: other prefers A1 (20 > 10 from their view)
- If I play A1: other prefers A1 (4 > 2 from their view)

**Nash equilibrium without mediator: Both play A1 → (4, 4)**

This is inefficient since (A0, A0) would give (10, 10), but it's not stable.

## Step 2: Compare the two mediators

**M1:** 1 player delegates → A1; 2 players delegate → A0
**M2:** 1 player delegates → A1; 2 players delegate → A0

**The mediators are identical!**

## Step 3: Analyze outcomes with this mediator

If the mediator is available, players first decide to delegate or not:

- **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)** ✓
- **Only I delegate**: Mediator plays A1 for me, other plays best response A1 → (4, 4)
- **Only other delegates**: I play best response A1, mediator plays A1 → (4, 4)  
- **Neither delegates**: Back to original game → (4, 4)

## Step 4: Find equilibrium with mediator

From stage 1 delegation decisions:
- If other delegates: I get 10 if I delegate, 4 if I don't → **I delegate**
- If other doesn't delegate: I get 4 either way → **Indifferent**

By symmetry, same for the other player.

**Equilibria:**
1. **(Both delegate) → (10, 10)** - Pareto superior!
2. (Neither delegates) → (4, 4) - Same as without mediator

## Step 5: Decision

Both M1 and M2:
- Are identical in design
- Enable a new equilibrium (10, 10) that's better than the no-mediator outcome (4, 4)
- Don't make things worse (worst case is still (4, 4))
- Help solve the coordination problem

**Conclusion: I should approve both mediators.**

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.


Instruction:

response:
To determine the optimal mixed strategy in this decision-making game, we need to consider the payoffs, the behavior of Player 2, and the role of the mediator. Let's break down the considerations step-by-step:

### Basic Analysis of Payoffs:

1. **Player 1 Chooses A0:**
   - Player 2 Chooses A0: P1 gets 10 points.
   - Player 2 Chooses A1: P1 gets 0 points.

2. **Player 1 Chooses A1:**
   - Player 2 Chooses A0: P1 gets 6 points.
   - Player 2 Chooses A1: P1 gets 4 points.

### Analysis of the Mediator:

If either player delegates:
- If 1 player delegates (either P1 or P2), the mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0 for both players.

### Considering Mixed Strategies:

Let's denote the probabilities:
- `p_A0` as the probability of choosing A0 directly.
- `p_A1` as the probability of choosing A1 directly.
- `p_A2` as the probability of delegating to the mediator (A2).

These probabilities must sum to 100%.

\[ p_{A0} + p_{A1} + p_{A2} = 100 \]

### Analyzing the Decision to Delegate:

- If P1 delegates, it plays A1 if P2 does not delegate (since the mediator plays A1 if only one player delegates).
- If both players delegate, they both play A0 (10, 10 payoff).

### Strategic Considerations:

**Player 2's Considerations:**

- If P2 believes P1 will not delegate, P2 might play A0 or A1.
- If P2 expects P1 to delegate, P2 might also delegate to ensure a mutual A0 play for max gain.

Given the symmetric nature of the mediator decision, if P2 is rational and seeks the best payoff, P2 might prefer to delegate to ensure mutual A0. 

### Mixed Strategy Solution:

To maximize expected utility for Player 1, we should blend the strategies considering the mediator's impact and independent actions:

1. Delegating has a high chance of leading to a mutually beneficial outcome.
2. Choosing A0 directly results in either 10 (if P2's A0) or 0 (if P2's A1).
3. Choosing A1 directly results in either 6 (if P2's A0) or 4 (if P2's A1).

Balancing expected payoffs, Player 1 may prefer delegating slightly higher due to reliability of mediator. However, considering Player 2 might not always delegate, some probabilistic weight on independent A0 and A1 is reasonable.

### Final Probability Distribution:

After considering these points, a balanced approach mixing direct actions and delegation could be:

- Delegation probability (p_A2): 50%
- Direct A0 and A1 (remaining 50%): split based on potential payoffs:
  - A0 is more beneficial if both play A0, so give a higher percentage than A1.
  - Reasonable fallback:
    - A0: 30%
    - A1: 20%

### Resulting JSON:
```json
{"A0": 30, "A1": 20, "A2": 50}
```

This balanced strategy leverages the mediator's coordination mechanism while retaining flexibility to act independently for varied scenarios.

## Step-by-step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the base game without mediation

Let me first analyze what happens without any mediator:

**My payoffs (Player 1):**
- If other plays A0: I get 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → I prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → I prefer A1

**Other player's payoffs (Player 2):**
- If I play A0: Other gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → Other prefers A1
- If I play A1: Other gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → Other prefers A1

**Key insight:** A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2! They always prefer A1 regardless of what I do.

Given this, I should play A1, resulting in outcome (A1, A1) with payoff **(4, 4)**.

### Step 2: Analyze what happens with the mediators

Both M1 and M2 are identical:
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

Let me consider all delegation scenarios:

1. **Both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → **(A0, A0) → I get 10**
2. **Only I delegate:** Mediator plays A1 for me, other plays A1 (dominant) → (A1, A1) → I get 4
3. **Only other delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for them, I play A1 (best response) → (A1, A1) → I get 4
4. **Neither delegates:** Nash equilibrium (A1, A1) → I get 4

### Step 3: Analyze the delegation game

The choice becomes: "Should I delegate to the mediator?"

**Delegation game payoffs for me:**

|                    | Other Delegates | Other Doesn't |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **I Delegate**     | 10             | 4             |
| **I Don't Delegate** | 4            | 4             |

**Analysis:**
- If other delegates: I prefer to delegate (10 > 4)
- If other doesn't delegate: I'm indifferent (4 = 4)

Therefore, **delegating is a weakly dominant strategy** for me. The same logic applies to Player 2.

### Step 4: Evaluate the mediators

Both mediators:
- Enable coordination on the optimal outcome (A0, A0) with payoff (10, 10)
- Have no downside: worst case is still (4, 4), same as without mediation
- Are identical in their rules

**Conclusion:** Both mediators are beneficial and help achieve a better cooperative outcome. There's no strategic reason to reject either one.

response:
Let's analyze the game step by step to derive a strategy that maximizes our total points. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Payoff Structure**:
    - A0/A0: 10 points each.
    - A0/A1: 0 points (me) and 20 points (other).
    - A1/A0: 6 points (me) and 2 points (other).
    - A1/A1: 4 points each.

2. **Understand the Mediator**:
    - If you delegate and the other player doesn’t, the mediator plays A1.
    - If both delegate, the mediator plays A0.
    - If neither delegate, individual choices apply (i.e., A0 or A1).

3. **Finding a Stable Strategy (Nash Equilibrium)**:
    - If both players choose non-delegation strategies, we find the mixed strategies over A0 and A1.
    - If we both delegate to the mediator, we both play A0 (which gives 10 points each).
    
4. **Delegation Analysis**:
    - Solo delegation: If only I delegate, the mediator chooses A1 for me, and I get 6 points at best if the other player chooses A0, which is not a guaranteed outcome.
    - Mutual delegation: Both delegating yields guaranteed 10 points each.

5. **Best Strategic Blend**:
    - Pure delegation can lead to stable, mutually beneficial outcomes if mutual trust is likely.
    - Independent choices lead to balancing risk between higher average points per round but with higher variance.

### Final Strategy:
Given the analysis, the optimal balanced strategy would involve using a combination of delegation and direct choices. Here, we could lean towards delegation but also include a non-zero probability of independent action to balance the risk.

Let’s say we delegate with a high but not absolute probability while taking actions independently on rare occasions to avoid effective counter-strategies from the opponent.

### Mixed Strategy Proposal:
- Delegate with 80% probability (A2).
- Direct actions (A0 and A1) split the remaining 20% with some bias towards A0 because mutual cooperation is more stable.

Given that:
- High delegation probability.
- Limited but balanced independence strategies.

Here’s the final probability distribution:

```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 10, "A2": 80}
```

### Justification:
- **Delegate (A2) 80%**: High trust in mutual benefits of delegation.
- **Choose A0 (10%) and A1 (10%)**: Keeping options flexible, with a slight preference away from high-risk independent actions.

This mix maximizes expected points while managing risk from possible opponent choices.

## Step 1: Understand the game without a mediator

Let me first construct the payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):

```
                Player 1
                A0      A1
Player 2  A0    10      2
          A1    20      4
```

Analyzing my best responses:
- If Player 1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If Player 1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 2)

**A1 is my dominant strategy.**

From Player 1's perspective, if I play A1 (which I will), their best response is A1 (getting 4 vs 0).

**Nash equilibrium without mediator: Both play A1 → (4, 4) payoff**

## Step 2: Analyze the mediators

Both M1 and M2 have **identical** strategies:
- If 1 player delegates: play A1
- If 2 players delegate: play A0

## Step 3: Evaluate outcomes with the mediator

**Case 1: Both players delegate**
- Mediator plays A0 for both
- Outcome: (10, 10) ✓ Much better than (4, 4)!

**Case 2: Only Player 1 delegates**
- Mediator plays A1 for Player 1
- I play independently, best response is A1
- Outcome: (4, 4)

**Case 3: Only I delegate**
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- Player 1 plays independently, best response is A1
- Outcome: (4, 4)

**Case 4: Neither delegates**
- Back to Nash equilibrium
- Outcome: (4, 4)

## Step 4: Determine equilibrium delegation behavior

The delegation game becomes:
```
                Player 1
                Delegate    Independent
Player 2  Del.  (10, 10)      (4, 4)
          Indep.  (4, 4)      (4, 4)
```

- If Player 1 delegates, I prefer to delegate (10 > 4)
- If Player 1 doesn't delegate, I'm indifferent but no worse off
- Same logic applies to Player 1

**Both delegating is a Nash equilibrium** that gives both players strictly higher payoffs (10 vs 4).

## Conclusion

Both mediators are identical and enable us to achieve the cooperative outcome (10, 10) instead of being stuck at (4, 4). This is clearly beneficial for me.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game without mediators

From my payoff matrix (Player 1):
- If opponent plays A0: I get 10 from A0 vs 6 from A1 → prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1: I get 0 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A1

From Player 2's perspective:
- If I play A0: They get 10 from A0 vs 20 from A1 → prefer A1  
- If I play A1: They get 2 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A1

**Key insight**: A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2. The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4), but (A0, A0) giving (10, 10) is Pareto superior.

## Step 2: Analyze Mediator 1 (M1) - my proposal

**If both delegate to M1:**
- M1 plays A0 for both → payoffs (10, 10)
- Can I deviate? If I don't delegate, M1 plays A1 for opponent. My best response is A1 → (4, 4). No incentive to deviate.
- Can opponent deviate? If they don't delegate, M1 plays A1 for me. Their best response is A1 → (4, 4). No incentive to deviate.
- **This is a stable Nash equilibrium at (10, 10)** ✓

**If neither delegates:**
- Regular game: (A1, A1) → (4, 4)
- Either player could deviate to delegating, but the analysis shows this stays at (4, 4)

## Step 3: Analyze Mediator 2 (M2) - opponent's proposal

**If both delegate to M2:**
- M2 plays A0 for both → (10, 10)
- If Player 2 deviates to not delegating: M2 plays A0 for me, they play A1 → (0, 20)
- **Player 2 has strong incentive to deviate! NOT a stable equilibrium** ✗

**If only I delegate to M2:**
- M2 plays A0 for me, opponent plays A1 → (0, 20)
- **Terrible outcome for me!** ✗

**If only opponent delegates to M2:**
- M2 plays A0 for them, I play A0 → (10, 10)
- But this relies on asymmetric play which is hard to coordinate

## Step 4: Decision

**M1 (approve):**
- Creates a focal point where both delegating yields (10, 10)
- Symmetric and stable
- Safe if only one player delegates (falls back to 4 points)

**M2 (disapprove):**
- Unstable when both delegate (opponent tempted to defect for 20 points)
- Dangerous if only I delegate (I get 0 points while opponent gets 20)
- Designed to potentially exploit me

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, let's analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating the delegation option (A2).

### Step 1: Analyze the Original Payoffs
The original payoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- (A0, A1): (2, 6)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In the base game, Player 1 has a dominant strategy to play A1 (since 20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 2's best response to A1 is A1 (4 > 0). The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1), yielding **(4, 4)**.

### Step 2: Incorporate the Mediator (A2)
The mediator rules are:
- If only one player delegates (A2), the mediator plays A1 for them.
- If both players delegate (A2), the mediator plays A0 for both.

Expanded payoff matrix (P1, P2):
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 | P2: A2 (Delegate) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10) | (2, 6) | (2, 6) |
| **P1: A1** | (20, 0) | (4, 4) | (4, 4) |
| **P1: A2 (Delegate)** | (20, 0) | (4, 4) | (10, 10) |

### Step 3: Evaluate Strategies for Player 2 (Me)
Let's look at my payoffs for each action depending on Player 1's choice:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 (10), A1 (6), **A2 (6)**
- If P1 plays A1: A0 (0), A1 (4), **A2 (4)**
- If P1 plays A2: A0 (0), A1 (4), **A2 (10)**

Comparing A1 and A2, A2 is a weakly dominant strategy for me because it yields the same results as A1 unless Player 1 also delegates, in which case it yields a much higher payoff (10 vs 4).

### Step 4: Evaluate Strategies for Player 1
- If P2 plays A0: A0 (10), A1 (20), **A2 (20)**
- If P2 plays A1: A0 (2), A1 (4), **A2 (4)**
- If P2 plays A2: A0 (2), A1 (4), **A2 (10)**

Action A2 is also a weakly dominant strategy for Player 1. It provides the highest possible payout regardless of Player 2's action (identical to A1 when P2 plays A0 or A1, but strictly better when P2 plays A2).

### Step 5: Conclusion
Since A2 is the weakly dominant strategy for both players and leads to the Pareto optimal Nash Equilibrium (10, 10), the most rational decision is to delegate to the mediator with 100% probability. This ensures that if the other player is also playing rationally or seeks to cooperate via the mediator, both receive the maximum possible points.

response:
Let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best strategy for maximizing the total points received. We'll consider how different actions affect the outcome and select a mixed strategy that would work best given these conditions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Possible Actions and Outcomes**:
   - **Playing A0**:
     - If Player 1 plays A0, I receive 10 points.
     - If Player 1 plays A1, I receive 2 points.
   - **Playing A1**:
     - If Player 1 plays A0, I receive 20 points.
     - If Player 1 plays A1, I receive 4 points.
   - **Delegating (A2)**:
     - If I delegate and Player 1 does not delegate, the mediator will play A1 (since only one player delegated).
     - If I delegate and Player 1 also delegates, the mediator will play A0 (because two players delegated).

2. **Selecting Probabilities**:
   - If I play A0 or A1, I'm directly choosing my action.
   - Delegating introduces uncertainty based on Player 1's choice to delegate.
   - Knowing the mediator’s strategy can help determine the best course of action depending on the likelihood that Player 1 will also delegate.

3. **Maximizing Points**:
   - We need to calculate the expected points for each action, given the above considerations. To achieve maximum points, the actions should take into account the potential moves of Player 1.

4. **Game Theory Consideration**:
   - If Player 1 is rational, they will also consider this setup and the potential outcomes when choosing to delegate or play independently.
   - A Nash equilibrium approach might be insightful, but without knowing Player 1’s exact strategy, we need a mixed strategy that guards against the worst outcome while potentially giving a high payoff.

### Expected Outcomes for Mixed Strategies:

Let’s consider if Player 1 is also thinking strategically about their scores. They will likely play mix of A1 and delegate to the mediator to maximize their payoff. Here's a simple analysis:

- **A0 (Independent Play)**: This is relatively safer but doesn’t maximize the score.
- **A1 (Independent Play)**: This has the highest score if Player 1 plays A0.
- **A2 (Delegate)**: This introduces uncertainty but could form a cooperative equilibrium if both players end up with the mediator playing a coordinated strategy.

### Choosing the Final Mixed Strategy:

Given the mediator’s setup and its reliance on both players delegating, a realistic strategy involves balancing between independent high reward play and delegation to explore potential cooperation. 

### Final Probabilities:

To safeguard against a mix of independent plays and delegation, we can divide the probabilities, with a slight preference for A1 (the highest point action) and delegation (to explore the cooperative mediator option).

- A0: 10% (a safe direct action)
- A1: 45% (the highest payoff action if Player 1 does not delegate)
- A2: 45% (delegation to explore the mediator strategy)

Thus, here's the final mixed strategy distribution:

```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": 45, "A2": 45}
```

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which mediators we should approve, given that our goal is to **maximize our total points** in this game.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)**

We are Player 2. The payoff matrix (from **our** perspective, Player 2) is:

| Our Action \ Other Player's Action | A0 | A1 |
|------------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                                 | 10 | 2  |
| A1                                 | 20 | 4  |

From the perspective of **Player 1** (the other player), the payoffs are:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------------------|----|----|
| A0                  | 10 | 6  |
| A1                  | 0  | 4  |

This is not a symmetric game. But importantly:

- If **we** play A1 and the other plays A0 → we get 20 (very good for us).
- If **we** play A0 and the other plays A1 → we only get 2 (bad for us).
- If both play A1 → we get 4 (worse than A1 vs A0, but better than A0 vs A1).

---

### **Step 2: Understand the delegation mechanism and the approval voting**

- We and the other player vote on which mediators to approve.
- The **winning mediator** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- We can delegate to a mediator, or act independently.
- The **mediator’s action depends on how many players have delegated to it** (1 or 2).
  - If only 1 player delegates → it plays A1
  - If 2 players delegate → it plays A0

So the mediator’s behavior is deterministic based on delegation counts:

| # Delegates | Action by Mediator |
|------------|--------------------|
| 1          | A1                 |
| 2          | A0                 |

Now, there are **two mediators proposed**, both from different players:

- **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**: Same behavior as above
- **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**: Same behavior as above

So **M1 and M2 are functionally identical** in behavior.

But we have to vote: approve or not approve.

Our goal: **maximize our own expected points**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the value of delegating and the mediator's impact**

Let’s compare the possible outcomes *if we delegate to a mediator*, versus if we act independently.

We want to think about **what happens in equilibrium** — i.e., what **we should do** based on what we expect the other player to do, and what the final outcome will be.

But note: **We are the one making the approval choice**. The other player is also voting.

We must decide: **Which mediators should we approve**, knowing that the winner is picked at random from the ones with max approvals?

Since M1 and M2 behave **identically**, approving one or the other has **no strategic difference** — they do the same thing.

But here’s the key point:

- If **we approve only one** (say M1), and the other player approves only M2, then both have 1 approval → both are tied → winner chosen uniformly at random from {M1, M2}.
- But since M1 and M2 behave **the same**, the outcome is unaffected by which one is chosen.

Thus, **the actual choice of mediator has no effect** on behavior — only **how many players approve it** matters.

So: **The only thing that matters is whether a mediator gets approved, and how many approvals it gets.**

But since M1 and M2 are **identical**, their approval counts are what matter **for selection**, but not for outcome.

Now, suppose **we approve both**.

- Then, if the other player approves, say, only M1, then M1 has ≥ 1, M2 has 1 → both have 1 → both are in the running → winner random.
- But due to symmetry, it doesn’t matter.

But suppose **we approve only one**, and the other player also approves only that same one → then that mediator gets 2 approvals → wins.

If we approve both, but the other player approves only one → that one gets 2, the other gets 1 → only the one with 2 wins.

But again, since both M1 and M2 behave identically, **the winning mediator has no difference in action**.

Therefore, **the behavior of the system depends only on how many players approve the mediator — but since the behavior of all mediators is the same, it doesn’t matter which specific one wins**.

So the outcome is determined by **how many players will delegate to the chosen (winning) mediator**, which depends on **whether we delegate**, **whether the other player delegates**, **and how many approvals each mediator got**.

But — we don’t know what the other player will do. So we must anticipate.

But — we control **only** our own approvals.

And the **winning mediator** is selected from those with max approvals, and each such mediator behaves the same way.

So **the mediator’s action depends only on how many players actually delegate to the winning mediator**.

Wait! Important clarification:

> “If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.”

So **delegation happens after the mediator is chosen**.

But the mediator’s rule depends on **how many players have delegated to it** — that is, **after** the choice of mediator, **but before** any action is taken.

So the process is:

1. We both vote on which mediators to approve.
2. The winning mediator is selected at random from the most-approved ones.
3. Then, each of us decides: delegate to the winning mediator, or act independently.
4. The mediator's action is determined by **how many players actually delegated** to it.

So **the mediator’s action depends on the *actual* number of delegates to it**, not how many approved it.

Therefore, **the behavior of the mediator is tied to real delegation — not to whether it was approved**.

But: we can only delegate to the **winning** mediator.

So:

- If the winning mediator is M1 (or M2), and **both of us delegate to it**, then it will play **A0** (because 2 delegates).
- If only one of us delegates, it will play **A1**.
- If neither delegates, then no one is using the mediator — so both of us act independently.

So the outcome depends on **our real delegation decisions**, and **who wins**.

But we need to choose which mediators to approve — and that affects the **probability that a mediator is selected**.

But because M1 and M2 are **identical in function**, and only differ in name, we can treat them as functionally the same.

So, we should ask:

> How does our approval strategy affect our expected payoff?

Let’s denote:

- Let’s assume the other player’s approval behavior is unknown. But we can try to **maximize our minimum expected payoff** (robustness), or assume rational behavior.

But perhaps we can **reason about likely outcomes**.

---

### **Step 4: Consider possible approval strategies and outcomes**

Let’s analyze our choice of approvals.

#### Option 1: Approve both M1 and M2

- Then, **any** approval pattern where both are approved will result in both being in the running.
- The other player may approve one or both.
- If the other player approves only one, then that one has 2 approvals (if we both approved it), so it wins.
- If the other player approves both, then both have 2 approvals → winner random between M1 and M2 → but since they behave the same, it makes no difference.

So: **if we approve both**, then **the winning mediator will be one of M1/M2, and their behavior is identical**, so **the action of the mediator depends only on how many actually delegate to it**, not which one is picked.

So whether it’s M1 or M2 doesn’t matter.

Therefore, approving both ensures that the mediator is **not excluded** from consideration — in fact, it increases the chance that *some* mediator is selected, and we can delegate to it.

But — **well, we can only delegate to the winning mediator**.

But if we approve both, and the other player approves only one, then that one has 2 approvals, the other has 1 → the one with 2 wins → we can delegate to that one.

But if the other player approves both, and we approve both, then both have 2 approvals → winner random → we can delegate to the one selected.

So **we can always delegate to the winning mediator, whether or not we approved it**? No — we can only delegate to the **winning one**.

But if we approve a mediator, **can we delegate to it**? Presumably, yes — because it’s approved, and we can choose to use it.

But if we approve a mediator and it **doesn’t win**, we cannot use it.

But if we approve a mediator, and it **wins**, we can use it.

But if we don’t approve it, we **cannot** use it.

So **approval is a prerequisite to delegation**.

Therefore, **only mediators that are approved can be used**.

So if we **do not approve M1**, and M1 wins, we **cannot delegate to M1** — so we have to act independently.

But if we approve M1, and M1 wins, we **can** delegate to it.

Therefore, **our approval determines whether we can use the mediator**.

So if a mediator wins but we didn't approve it, we can’t use it.

Thus, **to have a chance to delegate**, we must approve the winning mediator.

So, our **approval strategy** affects whether we can use the mediator.

Now, what is our goal?

We want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

We must choose which mediators to approve.

Since M1 and M2 are identical, the **only thing that matters** is **how many approvals they each get**.

Let’s suppose the other player is rational and wants to maximize their own points.

But we don't know their preferences.

But we can assume **both players are rational and self-interested**.

So let’s think about what happens in different scenarios.

---

### **Step 5: Simulate key scenarios**

Let’s suppose we **don’t approve anyone**.

Then, only the other player can approve mediators.

If the other player approves M1 or M2, and no one else approves it, then it may win (if it's the only one approved).

But if the other player approves, say, M1, and we don’t approve anyone → M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.

Then we can **only use M1 if we approve it** — but we didn’t → so we cannot delegate.

So we must act independently.

Similarly, if the other player approves both, then both have 1 approval → both are in running → winner random → but we can’t use either unless we approve it → but we approved none → so we cannot delegate → we act independently.

So: **if we approve no one, we can never delegate** → we must act independently.

In that case, the game reduces to the base game, where we choose a mixed strategy, and the other player chooses a mixed strategy.

But then it’s a one-shot game, and we need to find what strategy we should play.

But wait — the other player might **also** want to delegate, but their behavior depends on what mediators are approved.

But to maximize our payoff, we should **consider whether delegating can improve it**.

Let’s now consider: What would be my best action **if I could delegate**?

Suppose I delegate, and the mediator behaves based on how many delegate.

But we don’t control **how many delegate** — because the other player also chooses.

So, we need to consider **joint delegation decisions**.

But since we are choosing approvals, we can design our approval to **influence the outcome**.

Let’s suppose we **approve both M1 and M2**.

Then:
- No matter what the other player does, **at least one** mediator is approved.
- The winning mediator will be one of M1 or M2 (since we approved both).
- And since they behave the same, it doesn’t matter which.

Now: **can we delegate?** Yes — because we approved both, so we can delegate to the winning one.

Similarly, the other player may or may not approve them.

But — to maximize our control, we want to **ensure that we can delegate**, and **that the mediator’s behavior aligns with our interest**.

So let’s analyze the **mediator’s behavior**:

- If **only one player delegates** → mediator plays A1
- If **two players delegate** → mediator plays A0

Now, **if we delegate**, and the other player delegates → both delegate → mediator plays A0
- Then: **we play A0**, other player plays A0 → we get 10

- If we delegate, other player **does not** delegate → only we delegate → mediator plays A1
  - Then: we play A1, other player plays independently → **we want to know what the other player does**.

But the other player is rational and wants to maximize **their** points.

So if **we delegate to the mediator**, and the mediator plays A1 (because only one delegate), then **we are playing A1**.

Then, the other player will choose their action to **maximize their own payoff**, knowing we are playing A1.

Let’s compute the other player's best response to **us playing A1**:

- If they play A0 → they get 0
- If they play A1 → they get 4

So they will play A1 → so we get 4, they get 4.

So if **we delegate alone**, we get 4.

If **both delegate**, mediator plays A0 → so we play A0, other plays A0 → we get 10.

So our payoff in the two delegation cases:

- Only we delegate → we get 4
- Both delegate → we get 10
- Neither delegates → we play independently → we can choose our own strategy.

But if neither delegates, we play independently — we can choose a mixed strategy.

So let’s compare:

- If we delegate only when the other doesn't → we get 4
- If both delegate → we get 10
- If we act independently, we can choose a strategy.

So what is the best we can do if we act independently?

We need to analyze the **Nash equilibrium** of the base game.

Let me compute the Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- We (Player 2) play A0 with probability p
- Other player (Player 1) plays A0 with probability q

Our expected payoff:

$$
E = p q \cdot 10 + p (1 - q) \cdot 2 + (1 - p) q \cdot 20 + (1 - p)(1 - q) \cdot 4
$$

Simplify:

$$
E = 10pq + 2p(1-q) + 20(1-p)q + 4(1-p)(1-q)
$$

Expand:

$$
= 10pq + 2p - 2pq + 20q - 20pq + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq
$$

Combine like terms:

- pq terms: 10pq - 2pq - 20pq + 4pq = (10 - 2 - 20 + 4)pq = -8pq
- p terms: 2p - 4p = -2p
- q terms: 20q - 4q = 16q
- constants: 4

So:
$$
E = -8pq - 2p + 16q + 4
$$

Now, to find the best response, take derivative w.r.t. p, treating q as constant:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = -8q - 2
$$

This is **always negative** (since q ≥ 0 → -8q -2 ≤ -2 < 0)

So E is **decreasing** in p → so we should set p = 0 (play A1 with probability 1) to maximize E.

But that’s our perspective. We are Player 2.

But let’s be careful: if p = 0 (we always play A1), then:

$$
E = -8(0)q - 2(0) + 16q + 4 = 16q + 4
$$

So to maximize our payoff, we want q as high as possible → but q is chosen by the other player.

But the other player wants to maximize **their own** payoff, not ours.

So we need to find the Nash equilibrium.

Use the same method for Player 1.

Let’s compute Player 1’s expected payoff:

- If they play A0: payoff = q=0: 10 → but actually:

Payoff for Player 1:

- A0 vs A0: 10
- A0 vs A1: 0
- A1 vs A0: 6
- A1 vs A1: 4

So:

$$
U_1 = q \cdot 10 + (1 - q) \cdot 0 + (1 - p) \cdot 6 + p \cdot 4
$$
Wait: notation is messy.

Let’s define:
- q = P(Player 1 plays A0)
- p = P(Player 2 plays A0)

Then:
- P(both A0) = p q → Player 1 gets 10
- P(Player 1 A0, Player 2 A1) = (1-p) q → Player 1 gets 10? No:
Wait.

From the payoff descriptions:

- If Player 1 plays A0 and Player 2 plays A0 → Player 1 gets 10
- Player 1 A0, Player 2 A1 → Player 1 gets 0
- Player 1 A1, Player 2 A0 → Player 1 gets 6
- Player 1 A1, Player 2 A1 → Player 1 gets 4

So:

$$
U_1 = p q \cdot 10 + (1-p) q \cdot 0 + p (1-q) \cdot 6 + (1-p)(1-q) \cdot 4
$$

Simplify:

$$
U_1 = 10pq + 0 + 6p(1-q) + 4(1-p)(1-q)
= 10pq + 6p - 6pq + 4(1 - p - q + pq)
= (10pq - 6pq + 4pq) + 6p - 4p - 4q + 4
= (8pq) + 2p - 4q + 4
$$

Now, to find best response of Player 1 to our p, take derivative w.r.t. q:

$$
\frac{dU_1}{dq} = 8p - 4
$$

So:
- If 8p - 4 > 0 → p > 0.5 → Player 1 should play q = 1 (A0)
- If p < 0.5 → 8p - 4 < 0 → Player 1 should play q = 0 (A1)
- If p = 0.5 → indifferent

Similarly, for Player 2 (us), from earlier:
$$
E = -8pq - 2p + 16q + 4
$$

Take derivative w.r.t. q:

$$
\frac{dE}{dq} = -8p + 16
$$

So:
- If -8p + 16 > 0 → p < 2 → always true since p ≤ 1 → so derivative is always ≥ 8 > 0
- Thus, E is increasing in q → so we should set q = 1 (Player 1 plays A0) as much as possible → but we don’t control q.

But for **Player 2** (us), the best response to q is:

$$
\frac{dE}{dp} = -8q - 2 < 0 \quad \text{for all } q \in [0,1]
$$

So E is decreasing in p → so we should play p = 0 → always A1

Similarly, Player 1's best response:
- If p < 0.5 → play q = 0 → A1
- If p > 0.5 → play q = 1 → A0
- If p = 0.5 → either

But if we always play A1 (p=0), then p < 0.5 → so Player 1's best response: q = 0 → play A1

So if we play A1 (p=0), Player 1 plays A1 (q=0)

Then both play A1 → we get 4, they get 4.

Is this Nash equilibrium?

- If we deviate to A0: we get 2 if they play A1 → worse
- If they deviate to A0: they get 0 if we play A1 → worse

So yes, (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium → **both play A1 → we get 4 points**

But is there another equilibrium?

Suppose they play A0 (q=1), we play A1 → then we get 20, they get 0 → but they don’t want that, so not stable.

Suppose we play A0 (p=1), they play A1 → we get 2, they get 6 → they don’t want that.

So the only stable equilibrium is **both play A1**, giving us 4 points.

But is it the only one?

What if p = 0.5?

Then Player 1: 8*(0.5) - 4 = 0 → indifferent → can play any q.

But we want to minimize harm — but in equilibrium, it’s messy.

But in practice, **(A1, A1) is a dominant equilibrium**, since from both sides, it’s best response.

So without delegation, **we get 4 points** in equilibrium.

Now, let’s go back to delegation.

Suppose we **approves both M1 and M2**.

Then the winning mediator is selected at random from approved ones — but since both are approved and identical, it doesn’t matter.

Now, we can choose to delegate or act independently.

Suppose we **always delegate**.

Then, the mediator’s action depends on **how many players delegate**.

Case 1: Only we delegate → mediator plays A1 → we play A1 → other player will respond.

We are playing A1 → other player’s best response: play A1 (gets 4 vs 0) → so we get 4.

Case 2: Both of us delegate → mediator plays A0 → we play A0 → other player, knowing we play A0, will choose:

- A0 → get 10
- A1 → get 6 → so they choose A0 → we get 10.

So our payoff:
- If only we delegate → 4
- If both delegate → 10
- But we **don’t control** whether the other delegates.

But if we delegate, and they delegate, we get 10.
If they don’t, we get 4.

But **can we get 10?** Yes, if both delegate.

But **if we don’t delegate**, and they play A1 (as in equilibrium), we get 4.

But if we **delegate**, we get:
- 10 if they delegate
- 4 if they don’t

So we get **at least 4**, and potentially 10.

So if we believe the other player might delegate (or if we can induce them to), we could benefit.

But do we want to delegate?

Suppose we delegate.

Then, if the other player also delegates, we get 10 (better than 4).

If not, we get 4 (same as before).

So it’s **weakly better** to delegate, **regardless of what the other does**, as long as we can control the outcome.

But the other player might not delegate.

But what is their incentive?

If we delegate (so mediator plays A1 if only one delegate, A0 if two), and they **don’t delegate**, they act independently.

Suppose they know we are delegating → so they know the mediator will play A1 if only us delegating → so they know we play A1.

So they play A1 → get 4.

If they also delegate → the mediator plays A0 → they play A0 → we play A0 → they get 10.

So now: if they delegate, they get 10; if not, they get 4.

So they **benefit from delegating**.

So if **we delegate**, the other player has an **incentive to delegate** too — because it makes their payoff go from 4 to 10.

And if they delegate, we get 10.

So if we delegate, they will delegate too → because it’s better for them.

So **if we delegate, both will delegate** → both get 10 → we get 10.

This is much better than the independent equilibrium of 4.

Therefore, **we want to delegate**, and **if we can get the other player to delegate with us**, we get 10.

And the other player will **want to delegate** if we do, because it benefits them.

So this is a **self-fulfilling cooperation**: if we delegate, they are better off delegating too, so they do → outcome is both delegate → mediator plays A0 → we both play A0 → we get 10.

So **we get 10 points**, much better than 4.

Therefore, the **best outcome** is: **both delegate → get 10 each**.

Now, can we achieve this?

Yes — if we **approve a mediator**, and **both of us can delegate to it**, and we **both commit to doing so**.

But the key is: **we must approve a mediator** to be able to use it.

If we **don’t approve any**, we cannot delegate.

So to enable this good outcome, we **must approve at least one**.

But better: **approve both**, so that **no matter what**, the winning mediator is available, and we can delegate.

Now, what if we approve only one, but the other player doesn’t?

Then the mediator with 1 approval wins → we can delegate → we act.

Then the other player sees we delegate → sees that if they delegate, they get 10 → so they will delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → we get 10.

Same outcome.

But if we **approve only one**, and the other player has no idea, or doesn’t approve, then that mediator wins → we can delegate.

But what if we approve only one, the other player approves the other? Then both have 1 approval → both are in running → winner random.

Then, if we approve M1, and M2 wins, and we didn’t approve M2, then we **cannot delegate to M2** → so we must act independently.

Then, if we act independently, in equilibrium we play A1 → get 4.

But if we had approved M2, we could have delegated.

So **by not approving M2, we risk losing the chance to delegate**.

But if both are approved, then **whichever wins, we can delegate to it**, because we approved both.

So **to maximize our chance of being able to delegate**, we should approve both mediators.

Because:
- If a mediator wins, and we didn’t approve it, we cannot use it.
- But if we approved it, we can.

Therefore, to **ensure that we can delegate regardless of which mediator wins**, we should approve **both**.

Then, no matter which one wins, we can delegate.

Since both behave identically, it doesn’t matter which one wins.

So **approving both maximizes our ability to delegate in the desirable way**.

If we approve only one, and the other player approves the other, then if the other one wins, we cannot delegate → we get only 4.

But if we approve both, we can delegate regardless.

Therefore, **to avoid losing the opportunity to delegate**, we must approve both.

Moreover, as shown, **if we delegate, it’s in our interest AND the other player’s interest to also delegate**, leading to 10 each.

So the best outcome is achievable **only if both of us can delegate**.

And to enable that, we **must** be able to delegate — so we **must approve** the winning mediator.

By approving both, we guarantee that we **can** delegate, no matter which one wins.

If we approve only one, there is a chance (if the other player approves only the other) that the winning mediator is one we didn’t approve → we cannot delegate → we’re stuck with 4.

So **approximating both minimizes risk** and maximizes expected payoff.

Therefore, we should approve **both M1 and M2**.

response:
To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the payoff matrix of the base game (without a mediator).

**Base Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this base game, if we look at Player 2's options:
- If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 from A0 or 20 from A1. (A1 is better)
- If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 2 from A0 or 4 from A1. (A1 is better)
Thus, A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2. If Player 1 knows this, they will play A1 to maximize their own points (since 4 is better than 0), leading to a Nash Equilibrium of (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

**Introducing the Mediator (A2):**
The mediator acts based on the number of players who delegate:
- **1 player delegates (P2):** Mediator plays A1 for P2.
- **2 players delegate (P1 & P2):** Mediator plays A0 for both.

**Expanded Payoff Matrix (including A2):**
- **(P1=A0, P2=A2):** P2 delegates, so P2 plays A1. Result: (A0, A1) → (0, 20)
- **(P1=A1, P2=A2):** P2 delegates, so P2 plays A1. Result: (A1, A1) → (4, 4)
- **(P1=A2, P2=A0):** P1 delegates, so P1 plays A1. Result: (A1, A0) → (6, 2)
- **(P1=A2, P2=A1):** P1 delegates, so P1 plays A1. Result: (A1, A1) → (4, 4)
- **(P1=A2, P2=A2):** Both delegate, so both play A0. Result: (A0, A0) → (10, 10)

**Analyzing Strategy A2 for Player 2:**
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 20, A2 gives 20.
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4, A2 gives 4.
- If P1 plays A2: A0 gives 2, A1 gives 4, A2 gives 10.

A2 is a weakly dominant strategy for Player 2. It matches the best performance of A1 in all scenarios except when Player 1 also chooses to delegate, in which case A2 yields a significantly higher payoff (10 vs 4). Given that Player 1 is also a rational actor seeking to maximize points, they will recognize that A2 is their best response to Player 2's likely use of A2. This creates a stable Nash Equilibrium at (A2, A2) where both players receive 10 points.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P1
response:
Sure, let's break down the problem and devise a strategy to maximize our points based on the given rules.

### Steps to Consider:

1. **Analyze the Payoff Matrix**:  
   - If both choose **A0**: Each gets 10 points.
   - If Player 1 (P1) chooses **A0** and Player 2 (P2) chooses **A1**: P1 gets 0 points, P2 gets 20 points.
   - If P1 chooses **A1** and P2 chooses **A0**: P1 gets 6 points, P2 gets 2 points.
   - If both choose **A1**: Each gets 4 points.

2. **Analyze Delegation to the Mediator**:
   - If only one player delegates to the mediator, the mediator will choose **A1**.
   - If both delegate, the mediator will choose **A0**.

### Payoff Analysis for Delegating to Mediator:
- If **only P1 delegates**: 
   - If P2 delegates: Both choose **A0**, both get 10 points. 
   - If P2 does not delegate and chooses **A0**: P1 gets 6 points (P2 gets 2 points).
   - If P2 does not delegate and chooses **A1**: P1 gets 4 points (P2 gets 4 points).
  
  The expected payoff for P1 if only P1 delegates depends heavily on P2’s strategy when not delegating.

- If **both delegate**:
  - P1 and P2 both get 10 points as both will choose **A0**.

### Strategy:
Given the payoff structure and the mediator's behavior, let’s consider a mixed strategy:
1. **Delegation to Mediator** is highly attractive if P2 also delegates, leading to the highest possible joint outcome.
2. Given the mediator will play **A1** if only one player delegates, attempting to self-play might occasionally be more beneficial.

### Reasonable Strategy Proposal:
- Balance between delegating to the mediator and making independent moves.

1. **Weighting Delegation Slightly Higher**; it could lead to optimal payout if P2 also optimizes for higher joint payouts via the mediator.

2. **Leaning towards A1 if Not Delegating**; Since even if P2 does not delegate but plays **A0**, the payout is still reasonable.

Based on these considerations, a balanced mixed strategy might look like this:

- Delegate to Mediator (A2): 50%
- Independently Choose A0: 10%
- Independently Choose A1: 40%

This balances the risk and potentially maximizes the joint payout with an enhanced focus on delegation.

{"A0": 10, "A1": 40, "A2": 50}
```

This strategy aims to maximize the expected payout by leaning reasonably towards delegation to the mediator while not completely discarding the potential benefits of independent decisions.

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game without the mediator

Let me first understand the payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):

**My payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): 10 points
- (A1, A0): 20 points  
- (A0, A1): 2 points
- (A1, A1): 4 points

**Player 1's payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): 10 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points
- (A1, A0): 6 points
- (A1, A1): 4 points

## Step 2: Find dominant strategies

For me (Player 2):
- Against Player 1's A0: A1 gives 20 > A0 gives 10
- Against Player 1's A1: A1 gives 4 > A0 gives 2
- **A1 strictly dominates A0**

For Player 1:
- Against my A0: A0 gives 10 > A1 gives 0
- Against my A1: A0 gives 6 > A1 gives 4
- **A0 strictly dominates A1**

The base game Nash equilibrium is (A1, A0), giving me 20 and Player 1 gets 0.

## Step 3: Analyze the game with the mediator

The mediator rules:
- If only 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1 for that player
- If both delegate: mediator plays A0 for both

## Step 4: Check if (Delegate, Delegate) is an equilibrium

If both players delegate:
- Both play A0 → payoffs are (10, 10)

**Can I profitably deviate?**
- If I don't delegate while Player 1 does:
  - Player 1 plays A1 (only they delegated)
  - My best response: A1 (gives 4 vs A0 gives 2)
  - I get 4 < 10
  - **No incentive to deviate**

**Can Player 1 profitably deviate?**
- If Player 1 doesn't delegate while I do:
  - I play A1 (only I delegated)
  - Player 1's best response: A0 (gives 6 vs A1 gives 4)
  - Player 1 gets 0 < 10
  - **No incentive to deviate**

## Step 5: Conclusion

(Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium yielding (10, 10), which is:
- Better for Player 1 than the base game (10 vs 0)
- Pareto efficient (neither can improve without hurting the other)
- Stable - neither player wants to deviate

Since this mediator was proposed by me (Player 2), it serves to coordinate on the mutually beneficial outcome. A rational Player 1 will recognize this and delegate. Given Player 1 delegates, my best response is to also delegate.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (for me as Player 1)
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0 
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Analyze what happens with delegation

**If only I delegate (A2):**
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- vs Other's A0: I get 6
- vs Other's A1: I get 4

**If only other player delegates:**
- Mediator plays A1 for them
- My A0 vs their A1: I get 0
- My A1 vs their A1: I get 4

**If both delegate (A2, A2):**
- Mediator plays A0 for both
- We both get 10

## Step 3: Compare expected payoffs

If the other player delegates with any probability r' > 0, let me compare my options:

- **A0 payoff:** 10p' (only good if other plays A0)
- **A1 payoff:** 6p' + 4q' + 4r'
- **A2 payoff:** 6p' + 4q' + 10r'

Notice that A2 strictly dominates A1 whenever r' > 0 (delegation gives me 10 instead of 4 when both delegate).

## Step 4: Check for Nash equilibrium

**(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium:**
- If other plays A2, my best response payoffs are:
  - A0: 0 (other gets A1 from mediator)
  - A1: 4 (both get A1 from mediator)
  - A2: 10 (both get A0 from mediator) ✓ Best!
  
- By symmetry in incentives, if I play A2, other player also prefers A2 (they get 10 vs 4 or 2)

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning

The mediator creates a **Pareto-dominant equilibrium** at (A2, A2) with payoffs (10, 10), which is much better than the standard equilibrium (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4). 

Since I proposed this mediator and it was approved, this signals coordination toward the mutually beneficial outcome. The rational play is to delegate.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game without mediators

My payoff matrix (as Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

The other player has A1 as a dominant strategy (they get 4 vs 2 if I play A1, and 20 vs 10 if I play A0). Given they'll play A1, my best response is A1.

**Base game Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → both get 4 points**

Note: (A0, A0) giving (10, 10) is much better but unstable without coordination.

## Step 2: Compare the two mediators

**Mediator 1 (M1):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**Mediator 2 (M2):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1  
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**The mediators are identical!**

## Step 3: Analyze the delegation game

With either mediator present, I can choose to delegate or play independently:

**If both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → **(10, 10)** ✓

**If only I delegate:** Mediator plays A1 for me. Other player knows this and best-responds with A1 → (4, 4)

**If only other delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for them. I know this and best-respond with A1 → (4, 4)

**If neither delegates:** Back to base game → (4, 4)

## Step 4: Find equilibrium

The delegation game has payoffs:
```
                  Other Delegates    Other Doesn't
I Delegate:           (10, 10)          (4, 4)
I Don't:              (4, 4)            (4, 4)
```

"Delegate" weakly dominates "Don't Delegate" for both players. The unique equilibrium is **(both delegate) → (10, 10)**.

This is a huge improvement over the base game's (4, 4)!

## Step 5: Voting decision

Since:
1. Both mediators are identical
2. Both enable the cooperative (10, 10) outcome
3. This is much better than the (4, 4) baseline
4. There's no strategic advantage to rejecting either

I should approve both mediators.

response:
Let's go step by step through this complex decision-making game, taking into account all the rules, the payoff structure, the delegation mechanism, and the approval voting for mediators.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (No Delegation)**

The game is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1, and the following payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

This is a **coordination game** with **asymmetric payoffs**. There are two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): Both get 10 → stable (neither wants to deviate)
- (A1, A1): Both get 4 → less good, but stable (if both are playing A1, neither benefits from switching)

But (A0, A0) is better for both.

However, (A0, A1) is very bad for Player 1 (0 points), so we want to avoid that.

---

### **Step 2: Understand Delegation and Mediators**

You have two options:
1. **Act independently** (choose your own probabilities for A0/A1),
2. **Delegate** your move to a **mediator**.

But **before** you can delegate, the mediators must be selected via **approval voting**.

Both mediators are **proposed by the other player**:
- M1: Proposed by Player 1 (you)
- M2: Proposed by Player 2 (the other player)

Each mediator has a **conditional strategy** based on the number of players who delegate to it:

#### **Mediator M1 (by Player 1):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

#### **Mediator M2 (by Player 2):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **M1 and M2 have identical behavior!**

So, both mediators act exactly the same way:
- One delegate → play A1
- Two delegates → play A0

Therefore, **M1 and M2 are functionally identical**.

---

### **Step 3: Why Does This Matter?**

Despite being proposed by different players, they have **identical rules**.

So, **no difference in behavior** — they are indistinguishable in outcome.

Therefore, **approval of one or both doesn’t affect the outcome**.

But we are to vote via **approval voting**: each player approves some set of mediators. The **winning mediator is selected uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

Our goal: **Maximize our own expected points**.

So we must consider:  
- Who we approve  
- How that affects the probability of a certain mediator being chosen  
- How the chosen mediator affects our outcome, depending on delegation decisions

---

### **Step 4: Strategic Considerations in Approval Voting**

We are trying to pick which mediator(s) to approve **before** knowing whether we will delegate or act independently, or how the other player will act.

But we can **reason about what will likely happen**.

Key idea: **Our approval affects the chance that a mediator is selected.**

Since both M1 and M2 are identical in behavior, **what matters is how many people approve which one**.

We are one voter. The other player (Player 2) is also voting.

Important: **The mediator with the maximum approval count wins, and it's chosen uniformly at random among those tied for max.**

We want to **maximize our expected payoff**, which depends on:
- Whether we delegate or act independently
- Whether the other player delegates or not
- Which mediator is selected (though they’re identical, so irrelevant for behavior, but still matters for selection probability)

But since M1 and M2 behave identically, **the choice of which mediator is selected doesn’t matter** — outcome is the same.

So, **the only strategic question is: which mediator(s) should we approve to increase the chance that *our* preferred outcome occurs?**

But since both mediators behave the same, and we care about **our own expected payoff**, and **both mediators are functionally the same**, **it doesn’t matter which one is picked**.

So, **we can approve both**? But we must think carefully.

But let's suppose we **approving both M1 and M2** → then if we approve both, and the other player approves only one, our approval number is 2 vs 1 → we win.

But again: **it doesn’t matter which one wins** — same outcome.

But there's a catch: **the other player might be strategic too.**

They proposed M2, so **they will likely approve M2**.

They proposed M1, but we are Player 1 — they proposed M1 (by Player 1), but they are **Player 2**, so they are trying to influence the outcome.

Wait — let’s clarify the **proposers**:

- "Mediator proposed by Player 1" → this is M1
- "Mediator proposed by Player 2" → this is M2

So:
- M1 is proposed by Player 1 (you)
- M2 is proposed by Player 2 (the opponent)

So, **Player 2** is likely to **approve M2** (since it’s theirs), and might **disapprove M1**.

Likewise, you, as Player 1, are likely to **approve M1**, and possibly M2?

But you don’t **have to**.

Now: since the **mediators behave identically**, **it doesn’t matter which one is selected**, so **you are indifferent** between the two in terms of outcome.

But approval behavior affects **which mediator gets picked**.

So, should you approve both?

Let’s consider outcomes.

---

### **Step 5: What Happens When You Delegate?**

Suppose you **delegate**.

Then:
- The mediator’s behavior depends on **how many delegates** → i.e., whether **you** and/or **the other player** delegated.

Let’s consider possibilities:

#### Case 1: Only you delegate → 1 delegate
→ Mediator plays A1

So you get:
- If mediator plays A1, and the other player plays A0 → you get 6
- If mediator plays A1, and other plays A1 → you get 4

#### Case 2: Both delegate → 2 delegates
→ Mediator plays A0

So you get:
- If other player plays A0 → you get 10
- If other plays A1 → you get 0

Important: your action is now determined by the mediator, so **your outcome is only based on how the other player plays**.

So if both delegate, and mediator plays A0 → you get:
- 10 if other plays A0
- 0 if other plays A1

If only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get:
- 6 if other plays A0
- 4 if other plays A1

So, **you want the other player to play A0 if you delegate**, because:
- If you delegate and other plays A0: you get 6 (if only you delegate) or 10 (if both delegate)
- If you delegate and other plays A1: you get 4 (if only you) or 0 (if both)

So **you strongly prefer that the other player plays A0** if you delegate.

But if you act independently, you can control your own probability.

---

### **Step 6: What’s the Rational Choice for the Other Player?**

Let’s think about the other player’s incentives.

They are also rational. They want to **maximize their own payoff**.

They proposed M2, so they might prefer that M2 is chosen, but again: M1 and M2 are identical → doesn’t matter.

So they will approve **M2**, probably not M1.

You can also **approving M2** or not.

But here’s the key: since the mediators behave identically, your approval of one or both doesn’t affect the **outcome**, only the **chance of selection**.

But since both behave the same, **the outcome depends only on who delegates and how many**.

So, **the mediator choice (M1 vs M2) is irrelevant** — both do the same thing.

Therefore, **we should approve both**, because:
- It increases the chance that your favorite choice (M1) is selected — but again, it doesn't matter.
- Since you don’t care which mediator is selected, and M1 and M2 are identical, you might as well approve both.

But wait — **why would you approve a mediator that you know isn’t going to change the game?**

Because approval affects the **selection probability** — and if you want to **force a high approval count**, you can.

But the **only time** we care about which mediator is selected is if they acted differently — which they don’t.

So, **approval behavior only matters to the extent that it affects how many approvals each gets**.

But since we don’t care about the mediator **per se**, only about **outcomes**, and outcomes depend only on:
- How many people delegate
- What actions are played

→ The mediator choice is **neutral**.

Therefore, **we can approve both**, or only one, or none — **it doesn’t affect outcome**.

But here’s the catch: **we are trying to maximize our expected payoff**.

And our decision (whether to delegate or not) may depend on the **likelihood that a mediator is selected**, but since both behave the same, **it doesn’t matter**.

So: **approval of M1 or M2 has no effect on expected outcome**, since behavior is identical.

Then, is there any reason not to approve both?

Suppose you approve **only M1** → then M1 gets 1 approval, M2 gets possibly 1 (if opponent approves M2), so both might have 1 → then one picked at random → no difference.

If you approve both → M1 gets 2 approvals, M2 gets 1 → M1 wins for sure.

But again: outcome is unchanged.

So, **no strategic difference**.

But there’s another angle: **what if the mediator behavior were different?** But they’re not.

So, should you approve both?

Yes — because:

- You are Player 1, and M1 is **your proposed mediator**
- You want to **ensure that your mediator is available in case you delegate**
- Even though M1 and M2 behave the same, **if you only approve M1**, then if the other player **only approves M2**, both have 1 approval → then **either could be selected**, with 50% chance.

But since both behave the same, 50% chance of M1 or M2 → **no effect on outcome**.

So again: no difference.

But what if the other player is **not** rational?

We assume they are rational.

Therefore: **no difference in outcome between approving M1 only, only M2, both, or neither**.

So, which one should you pick?

But here’s a **key insight**:

You can **only use the mediator if it is selected**.

Suppose you approve **only M1**, and the other player approves **only M2** → both have 1 approval → one picked at random → 50% chance M1 is used, 50% M2.

But since both behave the same, **it doesn’t matter** — outcome same.

Same if you approve both → M1 gets 2, M2 gets 1 → M1 wins → same outcome.

So, **your approval doesn't change the outcome**.

But: what if you **don’t approve either**?

Then M1 has 0 approvals, M2 has 1 → M2 wins → you can still delegate to M2 → same as if M1 wins.

So again, **nothing changes**.

But the **only way** the mediator selection matters is if **the mediators acted differently**.

Since they **don’t**, and since both behave the same, and since you (as Player 1) proposed M1, **you have no reason to disapprove M1**.

Moreover, **you might be able to improve the chance of M1 being chosen** by approving it.

But again: **it doesn’t matter**.

But here’s a **strategic consideration**:

Suppose you **approve only M2**? That would be odd — you proposed M1, and M2 is the opponent’s.

But you can.

But why would you?

No reason — unless you want to help the opponent, which you don’t.

But again: no effect.

Wait — but suppose that **by approving M1**, you increase the chance that M1 is chosen, which might **signal commitment**?

Not relevant — we are not playing a signaling game; the mediator behavior is fully public and identical.

So, **no distinction**.

But we must **make a decision**.

Given that both mediators behave exactly the same, and you are **Player 1**, and **M1 was proposed by you**, you should **approve M1** to support your own proposal.

But you could also approve M2?

But M2 is proposed by the opponent — why would you approve their proposal?

That would be a **strategic concession** — you might do it to get a deal? But there’s no negotiation.

We are just voting based on **our own expected payoff**.

Since M2 is identical to M1, **approving M2 has no downside** — it doesn’t hurt you.

But **approving M1 is fine** — and you proposed it.

Moreover, **if you approve only M2**, and the opponent approves M2, then M2 wins.

But it doesn’t matter.

So, is there any reason to prefer one over the other?

No.

But consider this: **what if both mediators were different?** But they’re not.

Final thought: **since both mediators are identical in behavior, and you don’t care which one is selected, you should approve both to maximize the chance that your preferred choice (M1) is selected, but also to ensure the mediator is available.**

But since **the behavior is identical**, **approving both is safe and harmless**, and doesn't hurt.

Approving only one is also fine.

But here’s a **critical point**: the **winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

Suppose you **approve only M1**, and the other player **approves only M2** → both have 1 approval → each is selected with 50% chance → outcome same.

Suppose you **approve both**, and the other player **approves M2** → M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins for sure → no risk of M2 being selected.

But again: **same outcome**.

So no benefit.

But: **what if** you are worried that the other player might **not approve M2**? But they proposed it — so they will likely approve it.

But suppose they approve **neither**? That’s unlikely — rational self-interest.

They will approve M2 (their own) and probably not M1.

So, in the worst case:
- You approve M1 → 1 vote
- They approve M2 → 1 vote
- Both have 1 vote → 50% chance of M1, 50% of M2 → same outcome

If you approve both, you get 2 votes for M1, M2 still 1 → M1 wins for sure.

But again: no difference in outcome.

So, **approval choice has no effect on outcome** because mediators behave the same.

Therefore, **you are indifferent**.

But you must pick.

Now: **is there a reason to disapprove M2?**

Only if you believe it’s bad — but it behaves the same as M1.

So no.

Is there a reason to disapprove M1? Only if it's bad — but it's identical to M2.

You proposed it, so you likely think it's good.

So: **you should approve both** — it doesn’t hurt, and you support your own proposal.

Moreover, by approving both, you **force the outcome to be M1** if you get more approvals — but again, same outcome.

But: **what if there’s a chance that the mediator selection affects delegation decisions?**

For example, if you **know** that M1 is selected, you might be more willing to delegate.

But again, since M1 and M2 are identical, **no difference**.

So, conclusion: **approving both mediators is neutral and safe**, and supports your own proposal.

But we must decide: **do we approve M1 and M2?**

Yes.

But let’s double-check.

### **Final Step: Are There Any Incentives to Block the Other’s Mediator?**

Suppose you **disapprove M2** — is that strategic?

No. M2 behaves the same as M1.

So even if M2 is selected, the outcome is the same.

So you have **no reason to disapprove M2**.

Similarly, you have **no reason not to approve M1**.

Therefore, **approval of both is optimal** — it doesn’t hurt and shows support for your own proposal.

Moreover, it **increases the chance that a mediator is selected**, and since you might want to delegate, it’s better to have more options.

But since both behave the same, it doesn’t matter.

Still, **approving both** is not suboptimal.

In fact, it’s **safe and rational**.

If you approve only one, you risk that the other player doesn’t approve it — but again, outcome same.

So, best course: **approve both**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

===== Response [ID: e471f089] [2026-01-25 10:11:14] =====
agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P1
response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (without delegation)

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

In the base game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy of A1 (they get 20 vs 10 if I play A0, and 4 vs 2 if I play A1). If they play A1, my best response is A1 (4 > 0). So the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4).

## Step 2: Analyze delegation options

The mediator plays:
- A1 if exactly 1 player delegates
- A0 if both players delegate

## Step 3: Calculate expected payoffs for each action

Let q₀, q₁, q₂ be Player 2's probabilities for A0, A1, and delegation.

**If I play A0 directly:**
- vs their A0: 10
- vs their A1: 0
- vs their delegation (mediator plays A1): 0
- Expected: 10q₀

**If I play A1 directly:**
- vs their A0: 6
- vs their A1: 4
- vs their delegation (mediator plays A1): 4
- Expected: 6q₀ + 4q₁ + 4q₂ = 2q₀ + 4

**If I delegate (A2):**
- vs their A0 (I play A1 via mediator): 6
- vs their A1 (I play A1 via mediator): 4
- vs their delegation (both delegate, mediator plays A0 for both): 10
- Expected: 6q₀ + 4q₁ + 10q₂ = 2q₀ + 6q₂ + 4

## Step 4: Check for pure strategy Nash equilibria

**(A2, A2) - Both delegate:**
- If Player 2 delegates (q₂=1): My best payoff is 2(0) + 6(1) + 4 = 10 from A2 ✓
- If I delegate (p₂=1): Player 2's payoffs are 2 (A0), 4 (A1), 10 (A2) ✓

Both players get 10 points (the cooperative outcome), and neither has incentive to deviate. This is a **strict Nash equilibrium**.

**(A1, A1) - No delegation:**
Both get 4 points. This is also an equilibrium but Pareto-dominated.

## Step 5: Decision

The (A2, A2) equilibrium:
- Gives both players their maximum payoff (10 points)
- Is Pareto optimal
- Is a strict Nash equilibrium with no profitable deviations

The mediator was cleverly designed to create a coordination game where mutual delegation achieves the cooperative outcome (10, 10) that neither player could guarantee in the base game.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are Player 2 (as per the instruction). The payoff matrix from **Player 2’s perspective** is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)**         | 10     | 2      |
| **A1 (P2)**         | 20     | 4      |

Note: The payoffs are given as (Player 2's points, Player 1's points), so:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- (A0, A1): (2, 6)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

So from **Player 2's** point of view:
- Choosing A1 when P1 chooses A0 → 20 points
- Choosing A0 when P1 chooses A1 → 2 points (very bad!)
- Choosing A1 when P1 chooses A1 → 4 points
- Choosing A0 when P1 chooses A0 → 10 points

Player 2 wants to **maximize their expected payoff**, knowing that Player 1 is rational and will also play optimally.

But — now there's a **twist**: we can **delegate** to a mediator.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

There is an **additional action**: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

If you choose **A2**, then you **do not** choose A0 or A1 — instead, the mediator chooses for you based on **how many players have delegated**.

The mediator's behavior is:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Note: The mediator is shared. So outcomes depend on **both players’ choices** regarding delegation.

Let’s suppose:
- You (Player 2) choose A2 (delegate)
- Player 1 chooses either A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)

Then, the number of delegates determines the mediator’s action.

The mediator only acts if **at least one player delegates**.

We now need to evaluate expected payoffs under all possible combinations of actions.

---

### **Step 3: Enumerate All Possible Joint Actions and Outcomes**

Let’s denote:
- You are Player 2
- Player 1 is the other player

Each player chooses one of: A0, A1, A2.

So there are 3×3 = 9 possible combinations.

Let’s go through each:

---

#### **Case 1: You (P2) choose A0, P1 chooses A0**
- No delegation
- P2 plays A0, P1 plays A0
- Payoff: **(10, 10)**

#### **Case 2: You choose A0, P1 chooses A1**
- No delegation
- P2: A0, P1: A1
- Payoff: **(2, 6)**

#### **Case 3: You choose A0, P1 chooses A2 (delegate)**
- P1 delegates, you don’t
- Only 1 delegate → mediator plays **A1**
- So P2 (you) play A0, P1 (via mediator) plays A1
- Outcome: (A0, A1) → Payoff: **(2, 6)**

#### **Case 4: You choose A1, P1 chooses A0**
- No delegation
- (A1, A0) → Payoff: **(20, 0)**

#### **Case 5: You choose A1, P1 chooses A1**
- No delegation
- (A1, A1) → Payoff: **(4, 4)**

#### **Case 6: You choose A1, P1 chooses A2**
- P1 delegates, you don’t
- Only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- So P2: A1, P1: A1
- Outcome: (A1, A1) → Payoff: **(4, 4)**

#### **Case 7: You choose A2 (delegate), P1 chooses A0**
- You delegate, P1 does not
- One delegate → mediator plays **A1**
- So P2 plays A1 (via mediator), P1 plays A0
- Outcome: (A1, A0) → Payoff: **(20, 0)**

#### **Case 8: You choose A2, P1 chooses A1**
- You delegate, P1 does not
- One delegate → mediator plays **A1**
- So P2: A1, P1: A1
- Outcome: (A1, A1) → Payoff: **(4, 4)**

#### **Case 9: You choose A2, P1 chooses A2**
- Both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays **A0**
- P2: A0 (via mediator), P1: A0 (via mediator)
- Outcome: (A0, A0) → Payoff: **(10, 10)**

---

### **Step 4: Construct Payoff Matrix with A2**

Now, write payoff to **Player 2 (you)** in each combination:

| P2 \ P1 | A0     | A1     | A2     |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A0** | 10     | 2      | 2      |
| **A1** | 20     | 4      | 4      |
| **A2** | 20     | 4      | 10     |

So:
- A2 vs A0 → 20
- A2 vs A1 → 4
- A2 vs A2 → 10

Now we analyze this 3×3 game to find best response.

---

### **Step 5: Consider Rational Play — Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**

We are Player 2 and want to **maximize our expected payoff**, but we also assume the other player (P1) is rational and will choose to maximize their own payoff (which is different from ours!).

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** where both players choose strategies optimally.

But here’s a key insight: **you are the one who gets to decide your action including delegation**.

But to compute the best strategy, we need to anticipate what P1 will do.

Let’s analyze the **best responses** for both players.

---

### **Step 6: Analyze Payoff for Player 1**

Player 1’s payoff matrix (from their perspective):

From earlier:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- (A0, A1): (2, 6)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

When delegation occurs, we need to map the outcome:

| P2 \ P1 | A0     | A1     | A2     |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| A0     | 10     | 2      | 2      |
| A1     | 20     | 4      | 4      |
| A2     | 20     | 4      | 10     |

So Player 1's payoff:

| P2 \ P1 | A0     | A1     | A2     |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A0** | 10     | 6      | 6      |
| **A1** | 0      | 4      | 4      |
| **A2** | 0      | 4      | 10     |

So Player 1's payoff:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - vs P2 A0 → 10
  - vs P2 A1 → 0
  - vs P2 A2 → 0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - vs P2 A0 → 6
  - vs P2 A1 → 4
  - vs P2 A2 → 4
- If P1 plays A2:
  - vs P2 A0 → 6
  - vs P2 A1 → 4
  - vs P2 A2 → 10

So Player 1 **strongly prefers A2 when P2 chooses A0**, because then they get 6 vs only 10 if they play A0? Wait — no: when P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A2, **P1 gets 6**, but when both choose A0, P1 gets 10.

So:
- If P2 plays A0, P1 should play A0 (10) > A2 (6) > A1 (6)
- If P2 plays A1, P1 should play A0 (0), A1 (4), A2 (4) → best is A1 or A2 (4)
- If P2 plays A2, P1 gets: A0 → 0, A1 → 4, A2 → 10 → so best is A2

So best responses for P1:
- If P2 plays A0 → Best: A0 (10 points)
- If P2 plays A1 → Best: A1 or A2 (4 points)
- If P2 plays A2 → Best: A2 (10 points)

So P1’s best response:
- A0 if P2 plays A0
- A1 or A2 if P2 plays A1 or A2

Now, go back to **you (P2)**: you want to maximize your payoff, **given that P1 will best-respond**.

Let’s evaluate your expected payoff for each of your pure strategies, assuming P1 plays optimally.

---

#### **Suppose you play A0**

Then P1 will best-respond with **A0** (gets 10 > 6)
→ Outcome: (A0, A0) → you get **10**

#### **Suppose you play A1**

Then P1’s best response is **A1 or A2**, both give 4
- If P1 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4
- If P1 plays A2 → (A1, A2) → you get 4

So you get **4**

#### **Suppose you play A2**

Then P1’s best response is **A2** (gets 10 > 4 > 0)
→ Outcome: (A2, A2) → you get **10**

So your payoffs under best responses:
- A0 → 10
- A1 → 4
- A2 → 10

So you should **not play A1** — it gives you only 4.

So between A0 and A2, both give **10**, but are they truly equivalent?

Wait — maybe you can do better with a **mixed strategy** that induces a better outcome.

But P1 is rational. We need to find a **mixed strategy** for you that is a **best response to P1’s best response**, or find a **Nash equilibrium** where both are playing optimally.

Let’s suppose you **randomize** between A0 and A2, and **never play A1**.

Suppose you play:
- A0 with probability p
- A2 with probability 1-p
- A1 with 0

Then P1’s response depends on what you do.

Let’s find P1’s best response to this mixed strategy.

Let’s compute expected payoff for P1 of each action.

Let E_A0 = expected payoff if P1 plays A0
E_A1 = if plays A1
E_A2 = if plays A2

Given your mix:
- P(P2 = A0) = p
- P(P2 = A1) = 0
- P(P2 = A2) = 1-p

Now:
- **If P1 plays A0**:
  - P2 = A0 → (A0, A0) → P1 gets 10 → prob p
  - P2 = A1 → never happens
  - P2 = A2 → (A2, A0) → P1 gets 0 → prob 1-p
  - So E_A0 = p×10 + (1-p)×0 = 10p

- **If P1 plays A1**:
  - P2 = A0 → (A0, A1) → P1 gets 6 → prob p
  - P2 = A1 → never
  - P2 = A2 → (A2, A1) → P1 gets 4 → prob 1-p
  - So E_A1 = p×6 + (1-p)×4 = 6p + 4 - 4p = 2p + 4

- **If P1 plays A2**:
  - P2 = A0 → (A0, A2) → P1 gets 6 → prob p
  - P2 = A1 → never
  - P2 = A2 → (A2, A2) → P1 gets 10 → prob 1-p
  - So E_A2 = p×6 + (1-p)×10 = 6p + 10 - 10p = 10 - 4p

Now P1 will choose the action with highest expected payoff.

We need to find p such that P1 is indifferent between some choices, or find a mixture that makes P1 choose a particular action.

But you want to **maximize your expected payoff**, given that P1 will best-respond.

So let’s suppose P1 plays a best response to your strategy.

We can try to find a value of p where P1 is indifferent between two actions — that might lead to a mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let’s check equilibria.

---

### **Try to Find a Mixed Equilibrium Where P1 is Indifferent**

Suppose that P1 plays a mixture of A1 and A2 — then we need E_A1 = E_A2.

Set E_A1 = E_A2:
2p + 4 = 10 - 4p  
2p + 4p = 10 - 4  
6p = 6 → p = 1

So when p = 1 (you always play A0), E_A1 = 2(1) + 4 = 6, E_A2 = 10 - 4(1) = 6 → equal

So at p=1, P1 is indifferent between A1 and A2, and prefers A0 (10) → so actually still plays A0

So P1 strictly prefers A0 at p=1

So no equilibrium with P1 mixing A1 and A2.

Try if P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2?

Set E_A0 = E_A2:
10p = 10 - 4p  
14p = 10 → p = 10/14 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714

Then:
E_A0 = 10×(5/7) = 50/7 ≈ 7.14
E_A2 = 10 - 4×(5/7) = 10 - 20/7 = (70 - 20)/7 = 50/7 = 7.14 → equal

Now E_A1 = 2p + 4 = 2×(5/7) + 4 = 10/7 + 28/7 = 38/7 ≈ 5.43 < 7.14

So P1 would prefer A0 or A2 over A1, but since A0 and A2 give same payoff, P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2, and strictly prefers them over A1.

So P1 can mix between A0 and A2.

But if P1 can mix, then we need to find the **best response** for you.

But let’s go back.

If you set p = 5/7 (i.e., A0 with 5/7, A2 with 2/7), then P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2, and will play some mixture.

But what is your expected payoff?

Let’s compute your expected payoff under this p.

Your strategy: A0 with p, A2 with 1-p, A1 with 0

P1 chooses best response: mix between A0 and A2, say with probabilities q and 1-q.

But we need to know what P1 will actually do.

In equilibrium, P1 must be indifferent between A0 and A2 (since you're mixing), so they can randomize.

But the key is: **what is your expected payoff when P1 plays optimally**?

Let’s compute your expected payoff **as a function of p**.

Your expected payoff depends on P1’s best response.

Let’s define:

For given p (your prob of A0), what does P1 do?

- P1 will choose max over A0, A1, A2

Compute:
- E_A0 = 10p
- E_A1 = 2p + 4
- E_A2 = 10 - 4p

Compare:

- E_A0 vs E_A1: 10p vs 2p+4 → 8p vs 4 → p vs 0.5
→ If p > 0.5, E_A0 > E_A1
→ If p < 0.5, E_A1 > E_A0? Wait:

10p > 2p + 4 → 8p > 4 → p > 0.5

So for p > 0.5, P1 prefers A0 over A1

For p < 0.5, prefers A1 over A0

Now E_A0 vs E_A2: 10p vs 10 - 4p → 10p + 4p vs 10 → 14p vs 10 → p > 10/14 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714

So if p > 5/7, P1 prefers A0, else prefers A2

E_A1 vs E_A2: 2p + 4 vs 10 - 4p → 2p + 4p vs 10 - 4 → 6p vs 6 → p > 1

So never — E_A1 < E_A2 for all p < 1

So P1 **never** chooses A1 unless p = 1 (then both equal 6)

But at p=1, E_A0=10, E_A1=6, E_A2=6 → so prefers A0

So **P1 will never play A1** in equilibrium.

So P1’s best response is:
- If p > 5/7 → A0
- If p < 5/7 → A2
- If p = 5/7 → indifferent between A0 and A2

Now, **your payoff**:

- If p > 5/7 → P1 plays A0 → outcome: (A0, A0) if you play A0 → you get 10, or (A2, A0) → you get 20
  - So your expected payoff:
    - With prob p: you play A0 → get 10
    - With prob 1-p: you play A2 → get 20
    - E = p×10 + (1-p)×20 = 10p + 20 - 20p = 20 - 10p

- If p < 5/7 → P1 plays A2 → outcome:
  - If you play A0 → (A0, A2) → you get 2
  - If you play A2 → (A2, A2) → you get 10
  - So E = p×2 + (1-p)×10 = 2p + 10 - 10p = 10 - 8p

- If p = 5/7 → P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2, so can play mixture.

Let’s suppose P1 plays A0 with q, A2 with 1-q

Your expected payoff:
- If P1 plays A0 (prob q): you get 10 if you play A0, 20 if A2
- If P1 plays A2 (prob 1-q): you get 2 if A0, 10 if A2
- So E = p×[q×10 + (1-q)×2] + (1-p)×[q×20 + (1-q)×10]
= p×[10q + 2 - 2q] + (1-p)×[20q + 10 - 10q]
= p×[8q + 2] + (1-p)×[10q + 10]

Now plug in p = 5/7

E = (5/7)(8q + 2) + (2/7)(10q + 10)
= (5/7)(8q + 2) + (20q + 20)/7
= [40q + 10 + 20q + 20]/7
= (60q + 30)/7

This is linear in q, maximized when q = 1 → E = (60 + 30)/7 = 90/7 ≈ 12.857

But P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2, so if they choose q=1, P1 is still happy.

So P1 can choose q=1 (play A0), and you get E = 90/7 ≈ 12.857

Similarly, if P1 chooses q=0, you get (60×0 + 30)/7 = 30/7 ≈ 4.28 — worse for you

So **to maximize your payoff**, P1 would want to choose q=1?

But P1 wants to **maximize their own payoff**, not yours.

At p=5/7, P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2 — both give expected payoff E_A0 = 10p = 10×(5/7) = 50/7 ≈ 7.14
E_A2 = 10 - 4×(5/7) = 10 - 20/7 = 50/7 → same

So P1 is indifferent over q — they can pick any q

But **to maximize your payoff**, you would want P1 to play A0 (which gives you higher payoff when you play A0)

But P1 doesn’t care about your payoff.

So P1 will choose q to **maximize their own payoff**.

But since they are indifferent, they can choose any q.

In equilibrium, we usually assume they play a best response distribution.

But to **your benefit**, the worst case for you is if P1 plays A2 (since you get only 10 vs 20 if they play A0)

But P1 doesn’t care — they are indifferent.

So in the absence of further info, we assume P1 might **randomize**, but we must assume they play in a way that doesn't hurt them.

But since they are indifferent, they might choose to maximize **your** payoff? No — not rational.

So the only assumption is: they choose a best response — any mixture of A0 and A2.

So your expected payoff in this case depends on P1’s choice.

But in game theory, when there is indifference, we can assume the equilibrium mix.

But let’s think differently.

Let’s suppose that you want to **maximize your minimum possible payoff** — safety first.

Or — better: try to **find a strategy that gives you high payoff regardless**.

Let’s compute your expected payoff for different p.

We have:
- If p > 5/7: P1 plays A0 → E = 20 - 10p
- If p < 5/7: P1 plays A2 → E = 10 - 8p
- At p = 5/7 ≈ 0.714: E = (5/7)×10 + (2/7)×20 if P1 plays A0 → 50/7 + 40/7 = 90/7 ≈ 12.857

But if P1 plays A2, then E = (5/7)×2 + (2/7)×10 = 10/7 + 20/7 = 30/7 ≈ 4.28

So depending on P1’s choice, your payoff at p=5/7 varies.

But since P1 is indifferent, they might choose the mixture that is "fair" — for example, to make a symmetric equilibrium?

But here’s a better idea: **you can play A2 with some probability to force P1 to act differently**.

But notice:

- If you **always play A0**, P1 plays A0, you get 10
- If you **always play A2**, P1 plays A2, you get 10
- If you **mix** at p=5/7, and P1 plays A0, you get ~12.86

But P1 might not cooperate — they could choose A2 and give you only 4.28.

So to **maximize worst-case payoff**, you should avoid that.

But the goal is to **maximize expected payoff assuming rational play**.

Let’s suppose that when P1 is indifferent, they are **neutral**, and we can choose q to maximize **your payoff** — but that’s not valid.

Alternatively, **in symmetric equilibrium**, both players might do the same.

But here, you are Player 2, and the mediator was proposed by Player 2.

But there’s a **clever insight**:

### **Key Insight: If both players delegate, mediator plays A0 — you get 10**
But if only one delegates, mediator plays A1 — you get 4 or 20 depending on what you do.

But what if **you always delegate (A2)**?

Then:
- If P1 plays A0 → you get 20
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 4
- If P1 plays A2 → you get 10

But P1, rational, will not play A0 (since they get 0), and not play A1 (get 4), but will play A2 (get 10) — best response.

So P1 will play A2.

So outcome: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get 10.

So you get 10.

Similarly, if you play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 10.

Same.

But now: is there a way to get more than 10?

Only if P1 plays A0 while you play A2 — you get 20.

But P1 would never do that — because they get 0, while if they play A2, they get 10.

So P1 has no incentive to play A0 when you play A2.

So the only way to get 20 is if P1 plays A0 and you play A2 — but P1 will never do it.

So you can **never get 20** in equilibrium.

Similarly, if you play A1, P1 will play A1 or A2 → you get 4.

Worse.

So your best possible payoffs:
- A0: 10
- A2: 10 (in equilibrium)
- A1: 4

So both A0 and A2 give 10.

But can you do better with **mixing**?

Suppose you mix A0 and A2.

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability p, A2 with 1-p, 0 for A1.

As above:
- If p > 5/7, P1 plays A0 → your expected payoff = 20 - 10p
- This is decreasing in p.

At p = 1: 20 - 10 = 10  
At p = 0.8: 20 - 8 = 12? 20 - 10*0.8 = 20 - 8 = 12

But p=0.8 > 5/7≈0.714, so yes, P1 plays A0.

Then your expected payoff = 20 - 10p

But only if P1 plays A0.

At p=0.8, 20 - 8 = 12

So you get 12?

Wait — is this possible?

Let’s compute explicitly.

Suppose:
- You play A0 with prob 0.8, A2 with 0.2
- Since p = 0.8 > 0.714, P1 will play A0 (best response, gives them 8, vs 6.8 for A2)

So P1 plays A0.

Then your expected payoff:
- With prob 0.8: you play A0, P1 plays A0 → you get 10
- With prob 0.2: you play A2, P1 plays A0 → you get 20
- E = 0.8×10 + 0.2×20 = 8 + 4 = 12

Yes! 12

But is this sustainable?

P1 plays A0 → they get 10
If P1 deviates to A1: gets 6 (since you play A0 with 0.8, A2 with 0.2 → (A0, A1): 6, (A2, A1): 4) → E = 0.8×6 + 0.2×4 = 4.8 + 0.8 = 5.6 < 10 → not better

If P1 deviates to A2: then you play A0 → (A0, A2) → P1 gets 6; you play A2 → (A2, A2) → P1 gets 10
E = 0.8×6 + 0.2×10 = 4.8 + 2 = 6.8 < 10

So P1 has no incentive to deviate.

So P1 will play A0.

You get 12.

Can we do better?

Maximize E = 20 - 10p for p > 5/7

This is decreasing in p, so max when p is **minimized** above 5/7

So p = 5/7 + ε → E = 20 - 10*(5/7) = 20 - 50/7 = (140 - 50)/7 = 90/7 ≈ 12.857

But at p = 5/7, P1 is indifferent between A0 and A2.

Can P1 play A0?

Yes, and if they do, you get 90/7 ≈ 12.857

But if they play A2, you get only 30/7 ≈ 4.28

So if P1 is **rational but indifferent**, they might choose to play A2, hurting you.

But in game theory, we assume that they will play a best response — and since A0 is a best response, they can.

But to be safe, you should avoid depending on them playing A0.

But if you set p < 5/7, then P1 plays A2.

Then your expected payoff = 10 - 8p

This is decreasing in p.

At p = 0.7 (just below 5/7≈0.714), E = 10 - 8*0.7 = 10 - 5.6 = 4.4

Much worse.

So there’s a trade-off: higher p (above 5/7) gives you higher payoff **if P1 plays A0**, but if P1 plays A2, you get less.

But P1 will only play A2 if they prefer it — which is when p < 5/7

So at p > 5/7, P1 plays A0, which is best for you.

So **you can achieve up to about 12.857** by setting p slightly above 5/7, and trusting that P1 will play A0.

But is there a better strategy?

What if you play A1?

If you play A1 with positive probability, then P1’s incentive changes.

But in any case, A1 gives you only 4 in best response.

So it’s dominated.

So best is to play only A0 and A2.

Now, to **maximize your minimum payoff**, you could play p just above 5/7, but the expected payoff is highest at p = 5/7+.

But the highest achievable expected payoff **in equilibrium** is 90/7 ≈ 12.857, if P1 plays A0.

But can we force P1 to play A0?

Suppose you play p = 0.72 (72%), A2 = 28%

Then E_A0 = 10*0.72 = 7.2

E_A2 = 10 - 4*0.72 = 10 - 2.88 = 7.12 < 7.2

So P1 strictly prefers A0.

Your expected payoff = 0.72*10 + 0.28*20 = 7.2 + 5.6 = 12.8

Better than 10.

p = 0.714 (5/7) gives 12.857

You can set p = 5/7 = 0.714285...

But since we need integer percentages, we can't use fractions.

But we can choose the closest integer probabilities.

5/7 ≈ 71.4286% → round to 71 or 72?

Let’s try p = 71% = 0.71

Then:
- E_A0 = 10*0.71 = 7.1
- E_A2 = 10 - 4*0.71 = 10 - 2.84 = 7.16 > 7.1

So E_A2 > E_A0 → P1 plays A2

Then your expected payoff = 10 - 8*0.71 = 10 - 5.68 = 4.32 — very low

So worse.

p = 72% = 0.72
- E_A0 = 7.2
- E_A2 = 10 - 4*0.72 = 10 - 2.88 = 7.12 < 7.2 → P1 prefers A0
- Your expected payoff = 0.72*10 + 0.28*20 = 7.2 + 5.6 = 12.8

Good.

Can you do better?

p = 75%:
- E_A0 = 7.5
- E_A2 = 10 - 3.0 = 7.0 < 7.5 → P1 plays A0
- Your payoff = 0.75*10 + 0.25*20 = 7.5 + 5.0 = 12.5 < 12.8

Worse.

p = 70%:
- E_A0 = 7.0
- E_A2 = 10 - 2.8 = 7.2 > 7.0 → P1 plays A2
- Your payoff = 10 - 8*0.7 = 4.4

Worse.

So **p = 72% gives the highest reliable payoff**: 12.8

With no risk.

p = 72% (A0), 28% (A2), 0% (A1)

Total = 100%

Now, is there a better mix with A1?

Suppose you include A1.

But A1 gives you at most 4 in expectation, and if you play it, it might encourage P1 to play A1 or A2, which is bad for you.

For example, if you play A1 with 1%, then your A0 becomes 71% to stay at 100.

But then E_A0 = 7.1, E_A2 = 10 - 4*0.71 = 7.16 > 7.1, so P1 plays A2, your payoff ~4.4 — worse.

So adding A1 hurts.

So best is to play only A0 and A2.

Best probability:
- A0: 72%
- A2: 28%
- A1: 0%

Expected payoff: 12.8

Can we try 73% A0?

p=73% → E_A0=7.3, E_A2=10-2.92=7.08 < 7.3 → P1 plays A0
Payoff = 0.73*10 + 0.27*20 = 7.3 + 5.4 = 12.7 < 12.8

Worse.

71%: P1 plays A2 → payoff~4.32 — worse.

So **72% A0, 28% A2** maximizes expected payoff under worst-case rational play.

Thus, this is optimal.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To maximize the points received in this game, let’s analyze the interaction between the actions, payoffs, and the proposed mediators.

### 1. Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for the basic game (where Player 1 is the row player and you, Player 2, are the column player) is as follows:
- (A0, A0): 10, 10
- (A0, A1): 0, 20
- (A1, A0): 6, 2
- (A1, A1): 4, 4

For Player 2 (you), A1 is a dominant strategy. Whether Player 1 chooses A0 (20 vs 10) or A1 (4 vs 2), A1 always results in more points. 
For Player 1, the best response to A0 is A0, and the best response to A1 is A1.

In a standard Nash Equilibrium (without a mediator), both players would likely play A1, resulting in a payoff of **(4, 4)**.

### 2. Identifying Better Outcomes
The payoff (10, 10) is mutually beneficial compared to the (4, 4) Nash Equilibrium. However, Player 2 is tempted to deviate to A1 to get 20, and Player 1 is tempted to deviate to A1 to avoid getting 0. This is a variation of the prisoner's dilemma where coordination is difficult without a binding mechanism.

### 3. Mediator Analysis
Both proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical:
- **If 1 player delegates:** The mediator plays A1 for that player.
- **If 2 players delegate:** The mediator plays A0 for both players.

If a mediator like this is selected, the game shifts to the delegation phase:
- **Both Delegate:** The mediator plays (A0, A0), and both players receive **10 points**.
- **Only One Delegates:** If you delegate and the other player acts independently, the mediator plays A1 for you. The other player, knowing you are playing A1, will choose their best response (A1), resulting in (4, 4).
- **None Delegate:** Both players play independently. Based on dominant strategies/Nash Equilibrium, they play (A1, A1), resulting in (4, 4).

In this delegation game, (Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash Equilibrium because if one player delegates, the other player is better off delegating (getting 10) than acting independently (getting 4).

### 4. Decision
Since both M1 and M2 facilitate the coordination required to reach the (10, 10) outcome rather than the (4, 4) outcome, and since they are identical in their design, approving both increases the likelihood of a mediator being selected. A choice of either mediator provides a pathway to more points than the standard game.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix (from my perspective as Player 2)

```
              Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0       10              2
Player 2: A1       20              4
```

## Step 2: Analyzing Actions Without the Mediator

Comparing A0 vs A1:
- If P1 plays A0: I get 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0 → A1 is better
- If P1 plays A1: I get 4 from A1 vs 2 from A0 → A1 is better

**A1 strictly dominates A0 for me.** I should never play A0 directly.

## Step 3: Understanding the Mediator's Behavior

When I delegate (A2):
- If only I delegate (P1 doesn't): Mediator plays A1 for me
- If both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both → We both get 10

## Step 4: Calculating Expected Payoffs

If Player 1's probability of delegating is p2:

- **E[A0]** = 10p0 + 2p1 + 2p2 (always worse than A1)
- **E[A1]** = 20p0 + 4p1 + 4p2
- **E[A2]** = 20p0 + 4p1 + 10p2

The difference: **E[A2] - E[A1] = 6p2**

So A2 is better than A1 whenever Player 1 delegates with positive probability.

## Step 5: Finding the Nash Equilibrium

From Player 1's perspective (assuming I never play A0):
- If I delegate (q2 = 1): Player 1 gets 10 from delegating vs 4 from A1
- Player 1 strictly prefers to delegate

From my perspective:
- If Player 1 delegates (p2 = 1): I get 10 from delegating vs 4 from A1
- I strictly prefer to delegate

## Step 6: Equilibrium Analysis

**(A2, A2) is a Nash Equilibrium:**
- Both players delegate
- Mediator plays A0 for both
- Payoff: (10, 10)
- Neither player has incentive to deviate (deviation to A1 gives only 4 points)

This outcome is:
- Pareto optimal
- Achieves coordination on the mutually beneficial (A0, A0) outcome
- The mediator was specifically designed for this purpose

**Conclusion:** The optimal strategy is to delegate to the mediator.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:

response:
To decide which mediators to approve, I need to evaluate how each mediator impacts my objective of maximizing my total points. I'll analyze each mediator's strategy in both single-player and two-player delegation scenarios.

First, let's consider the game without any delegation:

- Payoff matrix:

  |            | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
  |------------|--------------|--------------|
  | **Player 2: A0** |   (10, 10)  |   (2, 6)   |
  | **Player 2: A1** |   (20, 0)   |   (4, 4)   |

- If I choose A0: I get 10 if Player 1 chooses A0 and 2 if Player 1 chooses A1.
- If I choose A1: I get 20 if Player 1 chooses A0 and 4 if Player 1 chooses A1.

Player 1 chooses A0:
- My expected benefit: 10 if I choose A0, 20 if I choose A1.
- My optimal choice: A1.

Player 1 chooses A1:
- My expected benefit: 2 if I choose A0, 4 if I choose A1.
- My optimal choice: A1.

It is clear that by choosing A1, I will either get the best possible outcome (20 points) or avoid the worst one (2 points). However, this isn't enough to let me decide the mediator to approve.

Now let's consider each mediator:

### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- If 1 player delegates, it plays A1.
- If both players delegate, it plays A0.

### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- If 1 player delegates, it plays A0.
- If both players delegate, it plays A0.

#### Single Delegation:
- Mediator 1: Plays A1.
- Mediator 2: Plays A0.

#### Double Delegation:
- Mediator 1: Plays A0.
- Mediator 2: Plays A0.

Now let's evaluate the payoffs with delegation:

**Mediator 1:**
- Single Delegation: I get 20 (since the mediator plays A1 and Player 1 is manually picking A0).
- Double Delegation: I get 10 (since both the mediator pairs play A0).

**Mediator 2:**
- Single Delegation: I get 10 (since the mediator plays A0 and Player 1 is manually picking A0).
- Double Delegation: I get 10 (since both the mediator pairs play A0).

From the analysis, Mediator 1 gives a better outcome in a scenario of single delegation (20 points versus 10 points for Mediator 2). Both mediators yield the same outcome under double delegation (10 points regardless). Hence, I should approve Mediator 1 for maximizing my payoff in the single-delegation scenario.

So, the optimal JSON object with approvals is:
```json
{"M1": true, "M2": false}
```

response:
Both proposed mediators are functionally identical:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that player.  
- If both players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

So there’s no strategic downside to approving either one versus the other; they implement the same mapping from delegation counts to actions. Approving both also avoids accidentally lowering the chance that an equivalent mediator is selected (and can only weakly help under approval voting).

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the basic game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 1)

|       | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Me: A0| 10        | 0         |
| Me: A1| 6         | 4         |

## Step 2: Analyze the mediator mechanics

- If only 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1 for that player
- If both players delegate → mediator plays A0 for both

## Step 3: Consider all scenarios with delegation

**If I delegate and other doesn't:**
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- If other plays A0: I get 6
- If other plays A1: I get 4

**If other delegates and I don't:**
- Mediator plays A1 for them
- If I play A0: I get 0
- If I play A1: I get 4

**If both delegate:**
- Mediator plays A0 for both
- We both get 10

## Step 4: Compare delegation vs direct play

For me, if I delegate:
- vs other's A0: I get 6 (same as playing A1)
- vs other's A1: I get 4 (same as playing A1)  
- vs other's delegate: I get 10 (much better than any direct play)

For the other player (who has A1 strictly dominating A0 in the basic game):
- Delegating gives them the same payoff as A1 when I don't delegate
- Delegating gives them 10 (vs 4) when I delegate

## Step 5: Find the equilibrium

Since delegation:
- Gives me 10 if other delegates (vs 4 or 0 from direct play)
- Gives other player 10 if I delegate (vs 4 from their best direct action)

Both delegating is a Nash equilibrium:
- If other delegates, my best response is to delegate (10 vs 4 vs 0)
- If I delegate, other's best response is to delegate (10 vs 4 vs 2)

This achieves the cooperative outcome (10, 10), which is why this mediator was proposed and approved.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff structure
From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Analyze the mediator mechanics
- If only 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1
- If both players delegate: mediator plays A0

## Step 3: Calculate expected payoffs for each action

**If I play A0:**
- vs Player 2's A0: 10
- vs Player 2's A1: 0
- vs Player 2 delegating (→A1): 0
- Expected: 10q₀

**If I play A1:**
- vs Player 2's A0: 6
- vs Player 2's A1: 4
- vs Player 2 delegating (→A1): 4
- Expected: 6q₀ + 4q₁ + 4q₂

**If I delegate (A2):**
- vs Player 2's A0: 6 (mediator plays A1 for me)
- vs Player 2's A1: 4 (mediator plays A1 for me)
- vs Player 2 delegating: 10 (mediator plays A0 for both)
- Expected: 6q₀ + 4q₁ + 10q₂

## Step 4: Compare strategies

Comparing A1 vs A2:
- E[A2] - E[A1] = (6q₀ + 4q₁ + 10q₂) - (6q₀ + 4q₁ + 4q₂) = 6q₂

**Key insight:** A2 (delegating) is always at least as good as A1, and strictly better whenever Player 2 delegates with positive probability.

## Step 5: Analyze Player 2's perspective

Similarly, for Player 2:
- A1 strictly dominates A0 (always gives higher payoff)
- A2 dominates A1 when I might delegate

## Step 6: Identify the Nash Equilibrium

If both players delegate (p₂ = 1, q₂ = 1):
- Mediator plays A0 for both
- Both get 10 points
- Neither player can improve by deviating (would get at most 6 or 4)

This is a strong Nash equilibrium and Pareto optimal.

## Step 7: Strategic reasoning

Since delegation weakly dominates playing A1 directly, and both players benefit maximally when both delegate, the rational choice is to delegate with certainty.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

In the original game without a mediator, A1 is dominant for Player 2 (they get 20 vs 10 if I play A0, and 4 vs 2 if I play A1). This leads to a Nash equilibrium of (A1, A1) = (4, 4).

## Step 2: Analyze the mediator outcomes

When I delegate (A2):
- If only I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me
- If both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both → gives us (10, 10)

Complete outcomes with delegation option:
- (Delegate, Delegate) → Both get A0 → (10, 10)
- (Delegate, A0) → I get A1 → (6, 2)
- (Delegate, A1) → I get A1 → (4, 4)
- (A0, Delegate) → They get A1 → (0, 20)
- (A1, Delegate) → They get A1 → (4, 4)

## Step 3: Identify best responses

If Player 2 delegates, my payoffs are:
- A0: 0 points
- A1: 4 points  
- Delegate: 10 points ✓ (best response)

If I delegate, Player 2's payoffs are:
- A0: 2 points
- A1: 4 points
- Delegate: 10 points ✓ (best response)

## Step 4: Strategic reasoning

The key insight: Player 2 **proposed** this mediator. They wouldn't propose a mechanism that hurts them. The mediator's purpose is to coordinate on (10, 10), escaping the inefficient (4, 4) Nash equilibrium of the original game.

Since:
1. Player 2 proposed this coordination mechanism
2. (Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium yielding (10, 10)
3. This is Pareto optimal and better for both players
4. If Player 2 expects me to delegate, their best response is to delegate
5. If I expect Player 2 to delegate (rational given they proposed it), my best response is to delegate

The rational play is to delegate with certainty.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Let's break this down step by step to determine which mediators you should approve as Player 1.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)

We are in a 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **P1: A1** | (6, 2)   | (4, 4) |

This is a classic asymmetric coordination game with incentives to avoid getting low payoffs.

Key observations:
- If you choose A0, you get 10 if the other chooses A0, but 0 if they choose A1 → risky.
- If you choose A1, you get 6 if other chooses A0, 4 if other chooses A1 → safer.
- The other player has an incentive to coordinate on A0 (they get 10 vs. 2), and for them to choose A1 when you choose A0.

But importantly: **You are Player 1**, so we must consider your own best interest.

In the standard game-theoretic analysis:
- A1 dominates A0 *for you*? Let’s check.
  - Suppose P2 plays A0: You get 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → better to play A0.
  - Suppose P2 plays A1: You get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → better to play A1.
  - So no dominance.

But note: if you play A1, your minimum payoff is 4, whereas playing A0 can give you 0. So A1 is "safer".

There is no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium where both players stick to A0 — because if both are playing A0, Player 2 gets 10, but would prefer to deviate to A1 (getting 20 instead of 10), so that’s not stable.

Let’s look for mixed Nash equilibria.

Suppose each player randomizes.

Let p = probability you (P1) play A0  
Let q = probability opponent plays A0

Expected payoff for you:
- If you play A0: 10q + 0(1-q) = 10q
- If you play A1: 6q + 4(1-q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4

For indifference: 10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So if opponent plays A0 with 0.5, you’re indifferent.

Now from opponent’s perspective: what is their best response?

They get:
- If they play A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2
- If they play A1: 20p + 4(1-p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → impossible.

So no mixed strategy equilibrium exists? Wait — that can't be right. Let's double-check.

We have:
- Opponent's payoff:
  - A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2
  - A1: 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4

So when does opponent mix?

Set: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -1/4 → invalid.

That means there is no value of p where opponent is indifferent. But since 16p+4 > 8p+2 for all p ∈ [0,1] (because 8p+4 > 8p+2), so opponent always strictly prefers A1.

Ah! That’s crucial.

**Conclusion**: No matter what you do, the other player **always strictly prefers to play A1**.

Because:
- If you play A0: they get 20 (A1) vs 10 (A0)
- If you play A1: they get 4 (A1) vs 2 (A0)

So A1 strictly dominates A1 for Player 2.

Therefore, **Player 2 will always play A1**.

Thus, rational Player 2 will never pick A0.

So, given that, your expected outcomes become:
- If you play A0: you get 0 (since they play A1)
- If you play A1: you get 4 (since they play A1)

So **you are better off playing A1**, giving you 4, rather than A0 (which gives 0).

Thus, the unique rational outcome in the base game is:
👉 You play A1, they play A1, you both get 4 points.

So without delegation, you get **4 points**.

Now — the twist introduces **mediation**, and **approval voting** for mediators.

---

### Step 2: Understanding Delegation and Mediators

You can:
- Delegate your move to a mediator.
- Or act independently.
- Before the game, you and the other player vote on **which mediator(s) to approve**, via **approval voting**.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

Note: Only one mediator will be used (the one selected at random from the most approved ones).

Each mediator has **behavior rules** based on how many players delegate to it.

You must now **approve or disapprove** each proposed mediator.

Two mediators are proposed:

#### Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

#### Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

💡 **Wait**: These two mediators have identical behavior!

- M1 and M2 both behave exactly the same:
  - 1 delegate → A1
  - 2 delegates → A0

So both mediators are functionally equivalent.

Therefore, **M1 and M2 are identical in their policy.**

No difference in logic, outcome prediction, or effect on strategy.

Thus, your decision to approve either one should be symmetric.

But here’s the key: **your goal is to maximize your total points.**

So you need to ask: **Under what scenarios would delegating to a mediator help you get more than 4 points (your default in the base game)?**

Remember: **You are Player 1**, and **Player 2 is rational and will always play A1 unless influenced.**

But mediation might change that — if the mediator causes the other player to adjust strategy, or changes the outcome.

Let’s simulate possible cases.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Possible Outcomes Based on Delegation

Remember: Only one mediator ends up being used — the one randomly selected from the most approved set.

But since M1 and M2 have **identical behavior**, whether you approve one or both doesn’t change the outcome probabilities — only the chance of selection. Since we are selecting uniformly at random from maximum-approved, approval patterns affect which one gets picked.

But our priority: **maximize your points**, regardless of the mechanism.

Let’s evaluate the **consequences** of different delegation decisions.

#### Case 1: Neither of you delegates → you play independently.

As established earlier: Player 2 will play A1 (dominant) → You play A1 → Outcome: (A1, A1) → You get **4**.

#### Case 2: You delegate, Player 2 does not.

Then:
- You delegate → one player delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- Player 2 plays independently → they still play A1 (since no incentive to change)

So result: (A1, A1) → You get **4**

Same as before.

#### Case 3: You don’t delegate, Player 2 delegates.

Then:
- One player delegated → mediator plays **A1**
- You play independently → you will play A1 (best response to P2 always playing A1)

→ Result: (A1, A1) → You get **4**

Again same.

#### Case 4: Both you and Player 2 delegate → two delegates → mediator plays **A0**

Then:
- The mediator (say M1 or M2) plays A0
- Other player also delegated → so they follow the mediator too? No!
  - Important: **Delegation means the mediator plays FOR you.**
  - But **both** players are delegating → so **both** are being played by the **same mediator** (the winning one).

Wait: Is that how it works?

Clarify: **Only one mediator is used for the whole game.**

> “you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator” → meaning if you delegate, the mediator handles **your** move.

If both decide to delegate, then both moves are controlled by **the same** mediator (selected via approval process).

So in case both delegate → the mediator makes **both moves**? Or just your move?

Let’s re-read:

> "if you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you"

It says **your** move. So **you** are delegating your choice to the mediator.

So if **both** players delegate, then:
- Mediator plays for you
- Mediator plays for them (if they delegated)

But **how**? The mediator has a rule **based on how many players have delegated to it.**

So the rule depends on **total number of delegations to this mediator**.

So if both players delegate to the mediator → 2 players delegated → mediator plays A0.

So **both players’ actions are determined by the mediator**, based on the rule: 2 players → A0.

Thus: both play A0.

So outcome: (A0, A0) → You get **10 points**.

That’s huge improvement from 4.

But wait: is this desirable?

Yes — if you can get both to commit to A0, you get 10.

But Player 2 may not want A0 — they get 10, yes, but only if **you** also play A0. If they play A0 and you play A1, they only get 2.

But in this setup, if both delegate to the same mediator, **they are both forced into A0**, so they get 10.

But remember — **Player 2 is rational and self-interested**.

So why would Player 2 want to delegate?

Let’s think from their perspective.

Suppose Player 2 is thinking: "Should I delegate?"

- If I don’t delegate and you don’t: you play A1 → me: A1 → I get 4
- If I don’t delegate and you do: you delegate → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → I still play A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → me: 4
- If I do delegate and you don’t: you play A1 → I delegate → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → I play A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → me: 4
- If I delegate and you do: both delegate → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → me: 10

So **from Player 2’s perspective**:
- Only when both delegate do they get 10 — otherwise they get 4.

So Player 2 would **prefer both delegate**, if they could coordinate.

But in the absence of trust, Player 2 may not delegate, because:
- Delegating alone gives them **no benefit** (still get 4)
- And risks nothing bad — so they could rationally delegate or not.

But if **you** are considering whether to delegate, you know that if **both** delegate → you get 10.

But if **only you** delegate → you get 4 (same as before).

If **neither** → you get 4.

So you get **10 only if both delegate**, and **you don’t get anything extra if only you delegate**.

But here’s the catch: **Player 2 may not want to delegate**, because:
- Delegating alone doesn’t help them (still 4)
- Only helps if both do → but then they get 10 ≠ 4.

So Player 2 has **incentive to delegate only if they believe you are delegating**.

But since they can't observe your decision during voting, they may hesitate.

But in the **approval voting phase**, both players simultaneously decide whether to approve a mediator.

---

### Step 4: Strategy in Approval Voting Phase

You are deciding which mediators to approve.

Since M1 and M2 have **identical behavior**, approving one or both has the same strategic effect. But the **number of approvals** affects whether a mediator wins.

The winning mediator is chosen **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve both M1 and M2 → then both have 1 approval (assuming no one else approves), so max is 1 → two candidates tied → winner chosen at random between M1 and M2 → same outcome either way.

But if you approve only one (say M1), and the other player approves only M1, then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.

But since M1 and M2 behave identically, it doesn't matter.

So effectively, your decision is only about **how many votes you cast**, and whether you want to increase the chance of a mediator being in power.

But **the key benefit** for you is triggering the **both-delegate scenario**, which leads to **both playing A0** and you getting 10.

To make that happen, **both players must delegate**, and that requires that **each player trusts the system** — especially Player 2.

Can you convince Player 2 to delegate?

Yes — through **approval voting**.

Here’s the idea:

- If **you approve a mediator**, that increases its chance of being elected.
- But **to get both players to delegate**, you need **Player 2 to trust that the mediator will behave appropriately**.

But remember: **Both M1 and M2 have the same rule**: if 2 players delegate → play A0.

So if the mediator is active, and both delegate → both play A0 → everyone gets 10.

But **is that credible?**

From Player 2’s point of view:
- If they delegate, and **you don’t**, then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → they play A1 → they get 4
- If they delegate, and **you do**, then two delegates → A0 → they get 10

So **they only gain from cooperation if you delegate**.

BUT: Player 2 doesn’t know whether you’ll delegate until later.

However, **if they believe that you'll delegate, and that the mediator will enforce A0**, then they will delegate too.

So **your signal** in the approval voting phase matters.

If you **approve a mediator**, that signals willingness to cooperate.

And if **Player 2 sees you approve**, they might think: "Oh, they’re willing to go for coordination. Maybe I should too."

But the **mechanism** is unclear — the mediator is fixed **after** approval voting, before delegation decisions.

The sequence is:

1. Approval voting: you and opposite player vote (approve) on mediators.
2. Winner selected (random from max approvals).
3. Then, each player decides whether to delegate or not.
4. Action taken accordingly.

So Player 2 sees your approval vote before deciding whether to delegate.

Similarly, you see theirs.

So it's **sequential** in effect, though not stated.

But both can see each other’s choices.

So if you approve a mediator, Player 2 can interpret that as a **commitment to delegate**, if the mediator is selected.

But actually: approving does **not** imply you will delegate — only that you're okay with the mediator existing.

But Player 2 knows that if you approve, and the mediator is used, then **you will be able to delegate** (since they’re not blocked).

The only way to prevent the good outcome is if **no one delegates**, or only one delegates.

But the **key insight** is:

> To achieve the 10-point payoff, **both must delegate to the same mediator**, and the mediator **must play A0** when 2 delegate.

Since **only one mediator is used**, both must be ready to delegate to it.

So you need to **encourage cooperation**.

Now, since **M1 and M2 are identical**, and **no preference between them**, and since **you benefit most from both delegating (gets 10)**, you want the mediator to exist **and be trusted**.

But if you **disapprove both**, the mediator cannot be selected → no mediation possible.

Then everyone acts independently → you get 4.

But if you **approve at least one**, and **Player 2 approves at least one**, then a mediator is selected (possibly M1, possibly M2), and then both can choose to delegate.

So you want to **increase the chance** that mediation happens and that **both players end up delegating**.

But here’s the problem: **Player 2** might not want to delegate unless they believe you will too.

So if you approve a mediator, and Player 2 sees that, and believes you are likely to delegate, then maybe they’ll delegate too.

But again: **approving doesn't force delegation** — it only enables it.

But since both mediators behave identically, you can approve **one or both**.

Which is better?

Approving **one** mediorator (say M1) means:
- M1 has 1 approval from you, 0 from others → unless Player 2 approves it, M1 won't win
- If Player 2 also approves M1 → M1 has 2 → M1 wins
- If Player 2 approves M2 → M2 has 1 → tie → random → same outcome

Approving **both**:
- Now even if Player 2 only approves one, say M1:
  - M1: 2 approvals (you + P2)
  - M2: 1 approval
  - M1 wins
- If Player 2 approves M2:
  - M1:1, M2:2 → M2 wins
- If Player 2 approves neither:
  - M1:1, M2:1 → tie → random → one wins
- If Player 2 approves both:
  - both have 2 → tie → random → one wins

So approving both ensures that **at least one mediator** wins, no matter what Player 2 does — as long as Player 2 approves at least one.

Even if Player 2 approves none, **you gave them something to vote for**, and it still results in a mediator being selected (with probability 1⁄2).

But if you approve just one, and Player 2 approves none, then **no mediator wins** — because max approval is 1 (yours), but only one has 1 → so it wins → still a mediator.

Wait: Let's clarify:

- "Winning mediator will be selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if you approve only M1 → M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → max is 1 → M1 wins → mediator is M1.

Similarly, if you approve only M1 and Player 2 approves only M2 → both have 1 → max is 1 → winner is chosen uniformly at random between M1 and M2 → so 50% chance M1, 50% M2.

If you approve both, and Player 2 approves none → M1:2, M2:2 → max is 2 → both qualify → winner is random → one of them chosen.

So in **every scenario**, **a mediator is selected**, **unless both approve zero**.

But your approval pattern affects which one is chosen — but since they are identical, it doesn’t matter.

So the **only risk** of failure is if **no one approves any mediator**, then **no mediator** is selected → you fall back to independent play → get 4.

But you control your vote.

So if you **approve at least one**, you ensure that **a mediator will be selected** (even if others don't), **as long as some approval occurs**.

But you're the only one who can ensure that.

Thus: **You should approve at least one**.

But should you approve both?

Let’s compare:

- Approve only one (say M1):
  - If Player 2 approves M1 → M1 wins → mediator exists → both can delegate → possible good outcome (A0, A0) → you get 10
  - If Player 2 approves M2 → then both M1 and M2 have 1 → random → one wins → same outcome → mediator exists → same possibility
  - If Player 2 approves neither → M1 wins (1 vote) → mediator exists

- Approve both:
  - Same thing: mediator almost certainly exists.

But **what if you approve only one**, and Player 2 approves the other?

Then:
- You: M1 → 1
- P2: M2 → 1
- Max=1 → winner chosen randomly (50% M1, 50% M2)

Same as if you both approve one — it’s fine.

But if you **disapprove both**, then:
- M1: 0, M2: 0 → max=0 → no mediator selected → game goes to independent play → you get 4.

So **by disapproving both, you guarantee that you cannot cooperate via delegation**, and thus **you never get 10**.

But **by approving at least one**, you allow the possibility of both delegating and hitting the 10-point outcome.

Moreover, since M1 and M2 are **identical**, **there is no downside to approving both**.

But here's a key insight: **Player 2 might be incentivized to approve a mediator only if they expect to benefit.**

But in this case, **if both delegate**, Player 2 gets 10 — same as you — so they benefit too.

So if you show willingness (by approving), and they know the mediator plays A0 when two delegates, they might say: “Ah, if I also delegate, I get 10 → worth it.”

So **both players benefit from coordinating**.

But only if they both delegate.

But if **you don’t approve any mediator**, no mediator exists → no coordination → you both get 4.

So **approving a mediator is necessary** to enable the higher payout.

But since the mediators are identical, **there is no reason to prefer one over the other**.

And **approving both** doesn't hurt you — in fact, it ensures that **no matter what Player 2 does**, a mediator is selected (unless they approve zero and you approve none — but you approve both).

Even if Player 2 approves no one, you still have 2 approvals → max is 2 → the mediator (either M1 or M2) is selected.

So **approving both** maximizes the chance that a mediator is selected — but it already was guaranteed as long as **you approve at least one**.

Is there a **downside** to approving both?

No.

So why not approve both?

Let’s suppose you approve only M1.

Player 2 sees: "They approved M1", so they might think: “Maybe I should approve M1 too.”

But if they approve M2 instead, **but you approved M1**, then both have 1 → random → still works.

But if you **didn't approve M2**, and Player 2 tries to approve only M2, it doesn’t interfere.

But if you **approve both**, it doesn’t hurt — and it gives more options.

But more importantly: **if Player 2 disapproves both, then no mediator is chosen → you get 4**.

But if you **approve one**, and Player 2 doesn’t approve any — then the mediator with 1 approval wins → you still get mediation → you can try to cooperate.

But if you **approve both**, and Player 2 approves none — still M1 and M2 both have 2 → max=2 → random → mediator chosen.

Same outcome.

So actually, **approving one or both is equally safe in terms of ensuring mediator selection**.

But **approving both increases the number of approvals** — so if Player 2 wants to support a mediator, they can only support one.

But if you support both, and they support one, then both have at least 1 — but if you support both, and they support neither, your approvals dominate.

But again: **outcome is same**.

But here’s a subtle point: **Player 2 benefits from both delegating**.

So if they see you approving, they may assume you’re going to delegate.

And if they see **two** mediators approved, it sends a **stronger signal** that you’re serious about cooperation.

But since M1 and M2 are identical, **adding more approval doesn't increase risk**.

Thus, **there is no cost to approving both**, and **it never hurts you**, and **it ensures that a mediator exists even if Player 2 disapproves both**.

Whereas if you approve only one, and Player 2 approves none, then that one gets 1 approval → wins.

But still, a mediator exists.

So both strategies lead to mediator existence.

But wait: **if you approve only one**, and Player 2 approves the same one → that one has 2 → wins.

If you approve both, and they approve one → the popular one has 2 → wins.

So **only when you approve both AND Player 2 approves both** do both mediators tie.

But worst case: **as long as you approve at least one**, a mediator is selected.

So the **minimum requirement** is: **approve at least one**.

But is there any case where approving both is worse?

No.

But let’s think: **What if Player 2 deliberately refuses to approve any mediator?**

Then:
- If you approve one mediator → that one wins → mediator exists → you can delegate → you might get 10 if they also delegate?
  - But **they refused to approve**, so did they delegate? Not necessarily.
  - But they might still delegate even if they didn’t approve the mediator.

The approval voting is **separate** from delegation.

So Player 2 can approve no one → no mediator → no mediation → they play independently.

But if you approve M1 → M1 wins → mediation available → then they can **choose** to delegate.

But they might not — because if they delegate alone → they play A1 (since one delegate) → they get 4, same as before.

So no incentive to delegate alone.

But if they **think you will delegate**, they may delegate too → then both delegate → A0 → they get 10 → better than 4.

So **if you approve a mediator, and they believe you will delegate**, they might.

But if you **approve both**, you send a stronger signal of commitment.

But since both mediators behave the same, it makes no practical difference.

Still, **advantage of approving both** is that **no matter what Player 2 does**, a mediator is selected — and even if they refuse to approve, **you still have 2 approvals**, so the winner is chosen from both (if they are tied).

So in **every case**, a mediator exists → delegation is possible → the 10-point outcome remains **possible**.

If you approve only one, and Player 2 approves none → mediator still exists.

So same.

But: what if both approve **only one**, but it's different?

Say you approve M1, Player 2 approves M2 → both have 1 → random → 50% M1, 50% M2 → still works.

So again, same.

Thus, **approving both is equivalent in outcome to approving one**.

But **there is no penalty to approving both**, and it provides **no downside**.

Therefore, **you should approve both**.

Because:
- It guarantees mediation is possible.
- It increases your credibility in signaling cooperation.
- There is no disadvantage.
- And **you maximize your potential payoff** by enabling the joint delegation path to (A0, A0), which gives you 10.

If you **disapprove either**, you weaken your position slightly — but not enough to matter.

But since **approving both is risk-free and potentially helpful**, and **you want to maximize your points**, you should do it.

---

### Final Decision:

You should approve both mediators, because:

1. They are identical in behavior → no difference.
2. Approving both ensures a mediator is selected even if Player 2 approves neither.
3. It increases the likelihood of both players cooperating (via delegation).
4. It allows the high-payoff (A0, A0) outcome to be reached if both delegate.
5. There is no downside.

So approve both.

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
Let's break this down step by step, carefully analyzing the game, the mediators, the voting process, and your objective.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game and Payoffs (Player 2's Perspective)

You are **Player 2**. The game is a simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from Player 2’s perspective):

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0        | A1        |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**                             | 10        | 2         |
| **A1**                             | 20        | 4         |

Let’s clarify who is who:
- You are **Player 2**
- The other player is **Player 1**

So, the matrix is written as:
- (Your action, Other player’s action) → (Your points, Other player’s points)

So:
- (A0, A0): You get 10
- (A1, A0): You get 20
- (A0, A1): You get 2
- (A1, A1): You get 4

---

### Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism

- You can choose to **delegate** your move to a mediator or **act independently**.
- Before the game, you both participate in an **approval voting process** to select which mediator(s) are active.
- The **winning mediator** is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- Mediator behavior depends on **how many players** delegate to it.

There are **two suggested mediators**, both proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 respectively (though the proposals are identical):

> **Mediator Proposed by Player 1 (M1):**
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

> **Mediator Proposed by Player 2 (M2):**
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ So **M1 and M2 are identical in behavior**.

Therefore, both mediators have the **exact same rule set**.

---

### Step 3: What Does Approval Mean?

You are to **approve** or **disapprove** of each mediator.

- You can approve both, one, or none.
- The winner is chosen **uniformly at random from the mediators with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve **both**, and the other player approves one of them (say, M1), then:
- M1: 2 approvals (yours + theirs)
- M2: 1 approval (yours only)
→ Max approvals = 2 → Only M1 wins (M2 has fewer) → Winner is M1.

But **if both players approve both**, then both have 2 approvals → Random winner between M1 and M2 → 50% chance each.

But since **M1 and M2 are identical**, it doesn't matter which one wins.

Therefore, **from a payoff perspective, only the set of mediators that are approved matters, not their identity.**

So your **approval choice** affects the **set of mediators available**, which in turn affects:
- How many mediators qualify to be selected (i.e., have max approvals),
- And thus, the **probability distribution over the winning mediator**.

But since **they behave identically**, the outcome depends only on **how many players end up delegating** to the **winning mediator**.

---

### Step 4: What is the Goal?

Maximize **your expected points**.

Your choices:
- Whether to delegate or not (but delegating requires choosing a mediator → i.e., one you've approved).
- And which mediators you approve (this affects which mediators can win).

---

### Step 5: What Are the Usual Outcomes Without Delegation?

Let’s first see what happens if **no one delegates**, and both players play independently.

Let’s find the **Nash equilibrium** of the base game.

Suppose you (Player 2) randomize with probability p on A1, and Player 1 randomizes with q on A1.

You want to maximize your expected payoff.

Your expected payoff:

- If Player 1 plays A0 (prob 1−q):
  - You get 10 if A0, 20 if A1 → your expected: 10(1−p) + 20p = 10 + 10p
- If Player 1 plays A1 (prob q):
  - You get 2 if A0, 4 if A1 → your expected: 2(1−p) + 4p = 2 + 2p

So total expected payoff:
> E = (1−q)(10 + 10p) + q(2 + 2p)

We now find best response.

But note: **Player 2** has strict incentive to choose A1 if Player 1 plays A0 (20 > 10), and A0 if Player 1 plays A1 (2 > 4? No — 2 < 4). Wait:

- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You get 2 for A0, 4 for A1 → better to play A1
- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You get 10 for A0, 20 for A1 → better to play A1

→ **A1 dominates A0** for Player 2!

Because:
- Against A0: 20 > 10 → prefer A1
- Against A1: 4 > 2 → prefer A1

So **A1 is strictly dominant** for Player 2!

Therefore, rational Player 2 will **always play A1** unless they delegate.

So if both play independently → both play A1 → you get 4 points.

But let’s confirm: is this really a best response?

Suppose you (Player 2) play A1 always.

Then, what should Player 1 do?

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - They get 0 (because (A1, A0) → you get 20, they get 0)
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - They get 4

So expected payoff for Player 1:
- If they play A0: 0
- If they play A1: 4

→ So they also prefer A1.

Thus, **(A1, A1) is the unique Nash equilibrium** → both play A1 → both get 4.

So **without delegation**, you get 4 points.

---

### Step 6: Can Delegation Help?

Now, delegation is possible. You can delegate to a mediator, whose action depends on how many players delegate.

Your choices:
- Approve mediators → affects which mediator can win
- Then, when the game is played, you may choose to delegate or not, based on the selected mediator.

But note: **delegation happens after the vote**, so you choose whether to delegate **after knowing** which mediator won (and it's random among approved ones with max votes).

But the **positional choice of delegation** (whether to delegate or not) is a **second-stage decision**.

But **we are only being asked to choose which mediators to approve in the approval vote**.

Your task is to **maximize expected points**, assuming that in the game stage, both players will play rationally (i.e., maximize their own payoff).

But here’s the catch: **you control approval**, and the other player (Player 1) also controls approval.

We don’t know what Player 1 will do. So we must make a **robust** approval decision, perhaps assuming rational behavior, or worst-case.

But the question says: **"Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of."**

It doesn’t say to assume Player 1’s actions, but since the outcome depends on both, we must consider possible responses.

So to be safe, we need to find an approval strategy that, regardless of Player 1’s choice (or assuming they also act rationally), **maximizes your expected payoff**.

Let’s consider the mediator behavior again.

The (identical) mediator:
- If **1 player** delegates → plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → plays **A0**

So:
- If only **one** player delegates: mediator plays A1
- If **both** delegate: mediator plays A0

Now, **you** choose whether to delegate, based on the outcome of the approval vote and which mediator wins.

But since mediators are identical, the choice only depends on **whether a mediator is approved and selected**.

So the scenario depends on:
- Which mediators are approved (you decide)
- Which one wins (based on vote tally)
- Then, both players decide whether to delegate (they might not, or they might)

But recall: delegation means that the **mediator** picks your action.

So your action is determined by:
- If you **delegate**, you adopt the mediator’s action.
- If you **don’t delegate**, you play independently (and since A1 is dominant for you, you would play A1).

But now, the mediator's behavior depends on **how many players delegate**.

So if **only one** player delegates → mediator plays A1
If **both** delegate → mediator plays A0

But which action is better for you?

Let’s analyze all possible states.

You are **Player 2**, and we must consider your choice.

Let’s suppose **a mediator is selected** (say, M1 or M2), and the game proceeds.

Now you must decide: **delegate or play independently?**

But **you want to maximize your points**, so you’ll choose the best response.

Let’s suppose the mediator is in place.

Now consider:

---

#### Case 1: The mediator is **not approved by you** → you cannot delegate → you must play independently → you will play A1.

→ You get 4 points (assuming other player plays A1).

But we’ll get back to that.

---

#### Case 2: You **approve the mediator**, so it can be selected.

Then, after the vote, a winner is picked.

Now, at game time, you decide whether to delegate or not.

Let’s suppose you **can delegate**, and the mediator is active.

You must decide: delegate or not.

Let’s consider possible scenarios based on **how many players delegate to the mediator**.

But your decision affects the number.

Let’s suppose **the mediator is the winner**, so it’s active.

Now, let’s suppose **you**, as Player 2, **choose to delegate**.

Then:
- If **only one** player (you) delegates → mediator plays A1
- If **both players** delegate → mediator plays A0

So your action depends on **whether Player 1 also delegates**.

But Player 1 also decides whether to delegate (if they approved the mediator).

So we need to model player incentives.

But remember: **you are trying to maximize your expected points**, and you don't know how Player 1 will vote or act.

So to be safe, we consider the **rational behavior** of both players.

Let’s suppose **you approve both mediators**.

Then, regardless of Player 1’s vote, the **maximum approvals you can get is 2** (if you approve both, and no one else approves any — but we don’t know).

Wait — what matters is **how many approvals each mediator gets**.

Suppose:
- You approve both M1 and M2.
- Player 1 can choose to approve M1, M2, or none.

Let’s suppose **Player 1 approves only M1**.

Then:
- M1: 2 approvals (yours + theirs)
- M2: 1 approval

→ Max approvals = 2 → Winner is **M1** (only one with 2) → M1 wins.

If Player 1 approves both, then M1 and M2 both have 2 approvals → winner is **random** between M1 and M2 → 50% each.

But since they are identical behaviorally, it doesn’t matter.

So in all cases, as long as at least one mediator is approved, the **winning mediator is a real mediator that will behave as above**.

Now, suppose the **winning mediator is active**.

Now, **both players** choose whether to delegate or not.

You (Player 2) want to choose **to delegate or not** to maximize your points.

Let’s compute your best response in various cases.

---

### Step 7: Analyze Delegation Like a Game

Suppose the **mediator is active** (i.e., was selected via approval).

You (Player 2) and Player 1 each decide whether to delegate to it.

Let’s consider all 4 combinations.

But recall: the mediator’s action depends on **how many players delegate**:

- 1 player: plays A1
- 2 players: plays A0

Now, compute payoffs (you are Player 2):

| Your Delegation | Other’s Delegation | # Delegates | Mediator Action | Your Action | Other’s Action | Your Points |
|------------------|--------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| No               | No                | 0           | Not applicable → both play independently → both play A1 → you get 4 |
| Yes              | No                | 1           | A1            | A1           | ? → Not delegated → Player 1 plays independently → A1 → you get 4 |
| No               | Yes               | 1           | A1            | Not delegated → A1 | A1 | you get 4? Wait — **you** are not delegated → you play A1 → but other plays A1 → you get 4 |
| Yes              | Yes               | 2           | A0            | A0           | A0 | you get 10 (because you play A0, other plays A0) |

Wait — this is important.

Let’s correct:

- If you delegate: your action is **whatever the mediator plays**
- If not: you play independently → which is **A1**, since dominant

Similarly for Player 1.

So let’s redo:

#### Case 1: You delegate = Yes, Player 1 = No
- # delegates = 1 → mediator plays **A1**
- You play A1 (via mediator)
- Player 1 plays A1 (independently)
→ Outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4

#### Case 2: You delegate = No, Player 1 = Yes
- # delegates = 1 → mediator plays **A1**
- You play A1 (independently)
- Player 1 plays A1 (via mediator)
→ Outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4

#### Case 3: Both delegate
- # delegates = 2 → mediator plays **A0**
- You play A0
- Player 1 plays A0
→ Outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 10

#### Case 4: Neither delegates
- No mediator used → both play independently → both play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4

Now, **your payoffs by choice**:

| Your Choice | Other’s Choice | Your Points |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Yes         | No             | 4           |
| No          | Yes            | 4           |
| Yes         | Yes            | 10          |
| No          | No             | 4           |

So:

- If **you** delegate, your payoff depends on **the other player**:
  - If they don’t delegate → you get 4
  - If they do → you get 10

- If you **don’t delegate** → you get 4 regardless

So **your best response** depends on what the other player does.

But here’s the catch: **you are not sure** what the other player will do.

But **you are rational**.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their own points.

Player 1 is similar.

Let’s analyze:

Player 1’s payoffs:

Same logic:

- If both delegate → (A0, A0) → Player 1 gets 10
- If only Player 1 delegates → (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets 4
- If only you delegate → (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets 4
- If neither → (A1, A1) → 4

So Player 1’s payoffs:
- 10 if both delegate
- 4 otherwise

So **Player 1 has strong incentive to delegate**, **if they believe you will also delegate**.

But if they think you won’t, then delegating gives them only 4 → same as not delegating.

So **Player 1 will only delegate if they believe YOU will delegate**.

This is a **coordination game**.

Nash equilibria:
- Both delegate: each gets 10 → a good outcome
- Neither delegates: each gets 4 → worse

So (Both delegate) is a Nash equilibrium (if both believe the other will do it, it’s best to do it)
(Both not delegate) is also a Nash equilibrium: if you expect the other not to delegate, then you get 4 either way, so not delegating is fine.

But **(Both delegate)** is Pareto superior.

But whether it occurs depends on **beliefs**.

But you can **influence** it via **approval choices**.

Key insight: **If you do not approve any mediator, then no mediator can be selected. So no one can delegate.**

→ Then both play independently → both play A1 → you get 4

But if you approve a mediator, and it gets selected, then there’s a chance for (both delegate) → you get 10

Even better: if you approve a mediator, then **facilitate the possibility of coordination**.

But if **you** approve a mediator, but **Player 1 does not**, then **the mediator cannot be selected** (because no one approved it) → so no delegation → you get 4

So for delegation to happen, **both players must approve at least one common mediator**.

But since M1 and M2 are identical, it's symmetric.

Now, your goal: **maximize your expected points**

Let’s suppose you **approve both mediators**.

Now, what is the worst-case outcome?

Suppose **Player 1 approves neither**.

Then:
- M1: only your approval → 1
- M2: only your approval → 1
→ Max approvals = 1, so **winner chosen uniformly at random from M1 and M2** → both have 1 approval → so each has 50% chance to be selected.

But **if a mediator is selected**, it can only be used if **both players approve it**.

But **Player 1 did not approve either** → **Player 1 cannot delegate to it**, even if it wins.

So **no one can delegate**, because delegation requires **approval**.

Therefore, **no delegation occurs**.

So both play A1 → you get 4.

So if Player 1 approves nothing, you get 4.

But suppose **Player 1 approves one mediator**, say M1.

Then:
- M1: 2 approvals (yours and Player 1)
- M2: 1 approval (yours only)

→ Max approvals = 2 → M1 wins.

Now, since M1 is approved by **both**, both can delegate to it.

Now, can delegation happen?

Yes.

Now, both players choose whether to delegate.

Now, **will they?**

As we saw:
- If both delegate → you get 10
- Otherwise → you get 4

Same for Player 1.

So both have **incentive to delegate IF they believe the other will**.

So **(both delegate)** is a Nash equilibrium.

But **(neither delegates)** is also.

So two equilibria.

Since you want to **maximize expected points**, you’d prefer **(both delegate)**.

But who chooses?

You need to **make it credible**.

But **you are not required to delegate** — you just have to approve.

But **when the mediator is active**, you can choose whether to delegate.

Now, suppose you **approve the mediator**, and it wins.

Then, **you** can choose to delegate or not.

If you **believe the other player will delegate**, then you should delegate → get 10.

If you believe they won’t, then you get 4 either way → so you’re indifferent.

But **cannot coordinate** unless both want to.

But **in the (both delegate) equilibrium**, both expect the other to delegate → it works.

Is it symmetric?

Yes.

So it's reasonable to **assume** that **if both approve a mediator**, then **they will coordinate on delegating** (since it gives 10 > 4).

So we can **assume that if a mediator is approved by both players, then both will delegate** → you get 10.

Now, if **only one player approves**, then **no mediator can be selected?** No.

Wait: a mediator wins **if it has maximum approvals**.

But suppose:
- You approve both M1 and M2
- Player 1 approves only M1

Then:
- M1: 2 (you + them)
- M2: 1 (you only)
→ M1 wins (max approvals)

Now, since **M1 is approved by both**, both players can delegate.

So delegation is **possible**.

Now, both players can choose to delegate.

And as above, they may both delegate → you get 10.

Even if Player 1 approves only M1, you approve M1 and M2 → M1 wins → both approve M1 → so both can delegate → outcome: both delegate → you get 10.

So **as long as the mediator is approved by both**, cooperation happens → 10.

But if **Player 1 approves neither**, then:
- M1: 1 (only you)
- M2: 1 (only you)
- Max = 1 → winner is random between M1 and M2 → say M1 wins.

But **Player 1 did not approve M1** → so **Player 1 cannot delegate** → only you can delegate, but if you delegate, you get:
- If only you delegate → # delegates = 1 → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays A1 → you get 4
- If you don’t delegate, both play A1 → you get 4

So you get 4 regardless.

So you **cannot** get 10 unless Player 1 also approves.

Therefore, **your best outcome (10)** requires:
- The mediator to be approved by both
- And both to delegate

So to maximize your chance to get 10, you want to **increase the likelihood that the mediator is approved by both**.

How?

You can **approve mediators** to **make it more likely that they get selected with high approval count**.

But if you approve **both**, and Player 1 approves **one**, then that mediator has 2 approvals → wins → both can act → you get 10.

If you approve **neither**, then no mediator can be selected → you get 4.

If you approve **only one**, say M1.

Then:
- M1: 1 (your approval)
- M2: 0 (if Player 1 approves neither, then M1 has 1, M2 has 0 → M1 wins)

But Player 1 must approve **M1** to be able to delegate to it.

But if Player 1 approves **neither**, then even if M1 wins, they can’t delegate → only you can delegate → but you get 4.

So again, you get 4.

But if Player 1 approves M1, then:
- M1: 2 (you + them)
- M2: 0
→ M1 wins → both can delegate → both delegate → you get 10.

So in this case, **you get 10 only if Player 1 approves the same mediator you approved**.

Same if you approve both.

So if you approve **both**, then **any mediator that Player 1 approves (M1 or M2)** will have **at least 2 approvals**, so it can win (if it has max).

But if you approve only one, and Player 1 approves the other, then:
- M1: 1 (you), 1 (them) → 2
- M2: 1 (you), 1 (them) → 2
→ Both have 2 → max is 2 → winner random among M1 and M2

Suppose M1 wins → approved by you and Player 1 → both can delegate → both delegate → you get 10

Same if M2 wins.

So **even if Player 1 approves a different mediator**, you still have a chance.

But if you **approve only one**, and Player 1 approves only the **other**, then:

- M1: 1 (you)
- M2: 1 (Player 1)
→ max = 1 → win by random choice (M1 or M2)
→ say M1 wins → but Player 1 did not approve M1 → so Player 1 cannot delegate
→ only you can delegate → but even if you delegate, you get 4

So **you get 4**.

But if **you approve both**, and **Player 1 approves only M1**, then M1 has 2 approvals, wins, both approve → both can delegate → both do → you get 10.

Similarly if Player 1 approves only M2.

And if Player 1 approves both → then both M1 and M2 have 2 approvals → random winner → say M1 → both approve → both delegate → you get 10.

So **only when Player 1 approves a mediator that you also approve**, can both delegate and you get 10.

Now, **if you approve both**, then **no matter which mediator Player 1 approves (M1, M2, or both)**, **there is at least one mediator that both approve**, so **one of them will win (since it has at least 2 approvals, unless Player 1 approves nothing)**.

Wait: if Player 1 approves **nothing** → then max approvals = 1 (yours on each) → random winning mediator → say M1 → but Player 1 didn't approve it → so **cannot delegate** → only you can delegate → you get 4.

So **only if Player 1 approves at least one mediator you approved** can you achieve 10.

But if you approve **both**, then **any mediator Player 1 approves (M1 or M2) is approved by you**, so **there is overlap**.

Only if Player 1 approves **nothing** do you fail.

If you approve **only one**, say M1:
- If Player 1 approves M1 → overlap → can get 10
- If Player 1 approves M2 → no overlap → you get 4
- If Player 1 approves nothing → you get 4

So **your chances are lower**.

But if you approve both, then **as long as Player 1 approves at least one**, **overlap exists**, so **you can get 10**.

And only when Player 1 approves nothing do you get 4.

So **by approving both**, you maximize the chance of coordination.

Moreover, if Player 1 approves both, you still get 10.

So **approving both** is **more robust**.

Now, what if you **approve only one**?

Then you miss coordination opportunity if Player 1 chooses the other.

But since Player 1 is rational, they might not care, but likely to approve at least one to potentially get the 10.

But we don’t know.

But from your perspective, you want to **maximize expected payoff**, so you should **approve both**.

Now, what if you **approve none**?

Then **no mediator can be selected** (since no approval for any) → winner is random from those with max approvals → but max approvals is 0 → no mediator has approvals → so no mediator wins → no delegation → both play A1 → you get 4.

Worse than the coordination case.

So **approving neither** gives worst-case 4.

Approving one gives **some chance** at 10.

Approving both gives **higher chance** at 10.

Therefore, **you should approve both**.

But let’s check: do you gain anything by **not** approving?

No. Approving both gives you **better options**.

And since the mediators are identical, there is no cost.

Even if you approve both, it doesn’t hurt you.

So **opportunity cost is zero**.

Therefore, **you should approve both**.

---

### Final Answer

You should approve both mediators to **maximize your chances of coordination**, which gives you 10 points instead of 4.

Even if Player 1 approves only one mediator, as long as it’s one you approved (which you did), coordination is possible.

Approving both is **upward-sensible**.

Also, if Player 1 approves both, you still get the chance.

Only if Player 1 approves nothing do you get 4 — but with any approval, you can get 10.

So **maximizing your expected points** requires approving both.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix
From my perspective as Player 2:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20
- (A0, A1): I get 2
- (A1, A1): I get 4

From Player 1's perspective:
- (A0, A0): They get 10
- (A0, A1): They get 0
- (A1, A0): They get 6
- (A1, A1): They get 4

## Step 2: Find the Nash equilibrium without a mediator
For me (Player 2), A1 is a dominant strategy:
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 2)

For Player 1:
- If I play A0: P1 prefers A0 (10 > 6)
- If I play A1: P1 prefers A1 (4 > 0)

Since I'll play A1, Player 1's best response is A1.
**Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → Payoffs: (4, 4)**

Note: (A0, A0) giving (10, 10) is Pareto superior but not stable without coordination!

## Step 3: Analyze both mediators
Both M1 and M2 are identical:
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 4: Analyze the delegation game
If this mediator exists:

**Delegation payoff matrix:**
```
                P1 Delegates    P1 Doesn't
P2 Delegates    (10, 10)       (4, 4)
P2 Doesn't      (4, 4)         (4, 4)
```

- Both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both → (10, 10) ✓
- One delegates: Mediator plays A1 for that player, other plays their best response A1 → (4, 4)
- Neither delegates: Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

## Step 5: Conclusion
Both mediators:
- Are functionally identical
- Enable coordination to achieve (10, 10) through mutual delegation
- Create a coordination game with a Pareto-optimal equilibrium
- Are strictly better than having no mediator (we can achieve 10 instead of 4)

Both mediators help escape the prisoner's dilemma structure and should be approved.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

This is a 2-player simultaneous move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 is row player, Player 2 is column player):

|              | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

We are player 1, and we’re trying to maximize our **own** expected payoff.

Let’s denote:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability p
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability q

Then Player 1's expected payoff is:
```
E1 = p*q*10 + p*(1−q)*0 + (1−p)*q*6 + (1−p)*(1−q)*4
   = 10pq + 0 + 6q(1−p) + 4(1−p)(1−q)
   = 10pq + 6q − 6pq + 4(1 − p − q + pq)
   = (10pq − 6pq + 4pq) + 6q − 4p − 4q + 4
   = (8pq) + 2q − 4p + 4
```

So:
> **E1 = 8pq − 4p + 2q + 4**

We can analyze for best response, but we’re not done — there’s a **twist**: **Delegation to a mediator** is now an option.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You can now choose to **delegate** your move to a **mediator** (action A2).

The mediator's behavior depends on **how many players delegate** to it.

- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0

Note:
- The mediator is **selected via approval voting**, so it's a shared resource.
- You can choose to delegate (A2) *or* play directly (A0, A1).

Your action space now is {A0, A1, A2}, and you must assign probabilities to each, summing to 100.

Let’s denote:
- p0 = prob you play A0
- p1 = prob you play A1
- p2 = prob you delegate (A2)

Similarly, let q0, q1, q2 be the opponent’s strategy.

But since the mediator’s action depends on **how many players delegate**, we must model the outcome based on **joint delegation decisions**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Possible Delegation Scenarios**

Let’s consider the possible numbers of delegations: 0, 1, or 2.

#### Case 1: 0 players delegate
- You play A0 or A1
- Opponent plays A0 or A1
- Payoffs as per base game

#### Case 2: 1 player delegates (either you or opponent)
- Mediator plays A1
- So whoever delegated gets A1 played for them
- The non-delegator plays their own action

#### Case 3: 2 players delegate
- Mediator plays A0
- Both players get A0 played for them

So:
- If you delegate, your action is **determined by the number of delegators**:
  - If only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get A1
  - If both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get A0
- Your own choice of A0 or A1 still matters only if you don’t delegate.

---

### **Step 4: Model Strategic Interactions**

Now, since you want to **maximize your expected payoff**, and the mediator’s move depends on **how many delegate**, we need to think about:
- What will the opponent do?
- Should you delegate, and under what conditions?

Since this is a **simultaneous move** game, we must look for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

But the twist is that each player can choose to delegate. So the space is larger.

Let’s think about **what happens if you delegate vs. not**.

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate Expected Payoffs for Delegation vs. Direct Play**

We need to consider **your strategy** (probabilities of A0, A1, A2) and the **opponent’s strategy** (unknown, but rational). Since both are rational and want to maximize their own payoffs, we assume symmetric reasoning.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and will pick strategies that are best responses.

We will **search for a symmetric Nash equilibrium**, because the game is symmetric in the base game (though the mediator’s behavior breaks symmetry slightly).

But wait — the mediator’s behavior depends on number of delegators, not identity. And the payoff matrix is **not symmetric**:
- (A0, A0) → (10,10)
- (A0, A1) → (0,20)
- (A1, A0) → (6,2)
- (A1, A1) → (4,4)

So the game is **not symmetric** in payoffs — Player 1 gets more when both play A1 (4 vs 4), but when Player 1 plays A0 and Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 20 — very asymmetric.

So we **cannot assume symmetry**. Player 1 is the one with the higher risk of being exploited.

But the delegation mechanism might help **coordinate** toward better outcomes.

Let’s try to analyze **what the mediator does** under different delegation patterns.

**Key insight**: Delegation is **strategic** — it can be used to **control your action**, but it depends on the other player’s actions.

So if **you delegate**, your action becomes:
- A1 if only you delegate
- A0 if both delegate

But you don’t know whether the opponent delegates.

So, when you choose to delegate (A2), your **effective action** is uncertain.

Let’s define:
- Let p = probability you delegate (A2)
- Let q = probability opponent delegates (A2)

Then, the possible delegation outcomes:

1. **0 delegations (prob = (1−p)(1−q))**: you play A0 or A1 (with your p0, p1), opponent plays A0 or A1 (with their q0, q1)

2. **Only you delegate (prob = p(1−q))**: you get A1 (since 1 delegate), opponent plays their own action (A0 or A1)

3. **Only opponent delegates (prob = (1−p)q)**: opponent gets A1 (since only one delegate), you play your own action (A0 or A1)

4. **Both delegate (prob = pq)**: both get A0 (since 2 delegators)

Now, we can compute your expected payoff **as a function of your mixed strategy and the opponent’s**, but since we don’t know the opponent’s strategy, we must **find a Nash equilibrium**.

But we can simplify by **assuming a symmetric equilibrium**: both players use the same strategy.

Let’s assume **both players use the same mixed strategy**:
- Play A0 with probability x
- Play A1 with probability y
- Delegate with probability z
with x + y + z = 1, and x, y, z ≥ 0.

But wait — if both players are symmetric, and the mediator’s behavior depends only on count (not identity), then in equilibrium, it’s plausible they use the same strategy.

So let’s suppose **you and the opponent both use the same mixed strategy**: (x, y, z) for (A0, A1, A2)

Then, we can compute your **expected payoff** as a function of x, y, z, and maximize under the constraint x + y + z = 1.

Let’s go through each case.

---

### **Step 6: Compute Expected Payoff Under Symmetric Strategy**

Let:
- x = P(play A0)
- y = P(play A1)
- z = P(delegate) = 1 − x − y

The four cases:

#### Case 1: 0 delegations (prob = (1−z)²)
- Both play A0 or A1
- Your action: A0 with prob x / (x+y) if both don't delegate, but since it’s conditional, better: use law of total expectation.

Instead, better to **compute the probability of each possible pair of actions**, considering delegation.

Since delegation determines action in a deterministic way, we can enumerate all joint outcomes.

Let’s list all possible combinations and their probabilities and your payoff.

Let’s denote:
- Your actions:
  - With prob x: A0
  - With prob y: A1
  - With prob z: A1 if only you delegate, A0 if both delegate

But the mediator’s move depends on **how many delegate**, so we must consider joint delegation decisions.

Let’s list the **four delegation scenarios**:

---

#### **Scenario 1: No one delegates** — prob = (1−z)²
- You play A0 with prob x / (x+y) → wait, no: **within this scenario**, you play A0 with probability x / (x+y)? No — that’s not correct.

Actually, the **overall** probability you play A0 is x, but **conditional on not delegating**, your probability of playing A0 is x / (x+y), assuming you play A0 or A1 with probabilities proportional to x and y.

But since z = P(delegate), then **P(not delegate) = 1−z**, and **conditional on not delegating**, you play:
- A0 with prob: x / (x+y)
- A1 with prob: y / (x+y)

Similarly for opponent.

But for expected payoff, we can compute total expectation as:

E[Payoff] = Σ over scenarios P(scenario) × E[payoff | scenario]

So let’s compute:

---

**(1) Both do not delegate: prob = (1−z)²**

- Your action: A0 with prob x/(x+y), A1 with prob y/(x+y)
- Opponent’s action: A0 with prob x/(x+y), A1 with prob y/(x+y)
- So your expected payoff in this case is:
  - E1 | no delegate = P(you A0, opp A0) × 10 + P(you A0, opp A1) × 0 + P(you A1, opp A0) × 6 + P(you A1, opp A1) × 4
  - = [x/(x+y)]² × 10 + [x/(x+y)][y/(x+y)] × 0 + [y/(x+y)][x/(x+y)] × 6 + [y/(x+y)]² × 4
  - = (10x² + 0 + 6xy + 4y²) / (x+y)²

Let’s call this value **E0**

So contribution: (1−z)² × E0

---

**(2) You delegate, opponent does not: prob = z(1−z)**

- You get A1 (since only 1 delegate)
- Opponent plays A0 with prob x/(x+y), A1 with prob y/(x+y)
- So your payoff:
  - If opp A0: (6, 2) → you get 6
  - If opp A1: (0,20) → you get 0
  - So E[your payoff] = (x/(x+y)) × 6 + (y/(x+y)) × 0 = 6x / (x+y)

Contribution: z(1−z) × (6x / (x+y))

---

**(3) You do not delegate, opponent delegates: prob = (1−z)z**

- Opponent gets A1 (only one delegate)
- You play A0 with prob x/(x+y), A1 with prob y/(x+y)
- Your payoff:
  - If you A0: opp A1 → you get 0
  - If you A1: opp A1 → you get 4
  - So E[your payoff] = (x/(x+y)) × 0 + (y/(x+y)) × 4 = 4y / (x+y)

Contribution: z(1−z) × (4y / (x+y))

---

**(4) Both delegate: prob = z²**

- You get A0 (since 2 delegates)
- Opponent gets A0
- So you get payoff: 10 (from A0 vs A0)

Contribution: z² × 10

---

Now, your **total expected payoff** is:

> E = (1−z)² × [ (10x² + 6xy + 4y²) / (x+y)² ]  
> + z(1−z) × [6x / (x+y)]  
> + z(1−z) × [4y / (x+y)]  
> + z² × 10

Note: x + y = 1 − z

Let’s define s = x + y = 1 − z

Then:

Let’s write everything in terms of x, y, z, with x + y = s = 1 − z

Then:

- E0 = (10x² + 6xy + 4y²) / s²
- 6x / s
- 4y / s

So:

> E = (1−z)² × (10x² + 6xy + 4y²)/s²  
> + z(1−z) × (6x + 4y)/s  
> + 10 z²

But since s = 1−z, we can write:

> E = s² × (10x² + 6xy + 4y²)/s²  
> + z s × (6x + 4y)/s  
> + 10 z²

Simplify:

> E = (10x² + 6xy + 4y²) + z(6x + 4y) + 10 z²

Now, x + y = s = 1 − z → y = 1 − z − x

We can now write E as a function of x and z.

Let’s substitute y = 1 − z − x

Then:
- x² = x²
- xy = x(1−z−x) = x(1−z) − x²
- y² = (1−z−x)² = (1−z)² − 2(1−z)x + x²

Now compute numerator:

10x² + 6xy + 4y²  
= 10x² + 6[x(1−z) − x²] + 4[(1−z)² − 2(1−z)x + x²]  
= 10x² + 6x(1−z) − 6x² + 4(1−z)² − 8(1−z)x + 4x²  
= (10−6+4)x² + [6(1−z) − 8(1−z)]x + 4(1−z)²  
= 8x² − 2(1−z)x + 4(1−z)²

Now:

6x + 4y = 6x + 4(1−z−x) = 6x + 4(1−z) − 4x = 2x + 4(1−z)

So:

> E = [8x² − 2(1−z)x + 4(1−z)²] + z[2x + 4(1−z)] + 10z²

Expand:

= 8x² − 2(1−z)x + 4(1−z)² + 2z x + 4z(1−z) + 10z²

Now simplify term by term.

First, group x²: 8x²

Group x terms: [−2(1−z) + 2z] x = [−2 + 2z + 2z] x = (−2 + 4z)x

Constant terms (in x):
4(1−z)² + 4z(1−z) + 10z²

Compute:
- 4(1−2z+z²) = 4 − 8z + 4z²
- 4z(1−z) = 4z − 4z²
- 10z²

Sum: 4 − 8z + 4z² + 4z − 4z² + 10z² = 4 − 4z + 10z²

So total E:

> E = 8x² + (−2 + 4z)x + (4 − 4z + 10z²)

This is the **expected payoff** as a function of x and z (with y determined by y = 1−z−x)

To maximize E, for a fixed z, we can choose x to maximize this quadratic in x.

This is a quadratic in x: E = 8x² + (−2 + 4z)x + const

Since coefficient of x² is positive (8 > 0), it’s convex — so **minimum** at vertex, not maximum.

Wait! That can’t be — we are trying to find the **maximum**, but a convex function over x has **maximum at boundary**, not interior.

So for fixed z, **E is minimized at vertex, maximized at endpoints of x**.

Since x ∈ [0, 1−z], the maximum occurs at x = 0 or x = 1−z.

That is, **for any fixed z, optimal x is either 0 or 1−z** — meaning, **either you play only A0 or only A1 when not delegating — no mixing**.

This is a crucial insight.

So **in equilibrium, we can assume that when you do not delegate, you play pure A0 or pure A1**.

That simplifies things.

So cases:
- x = 0: then y = 1−z → you play A1 when not delegating
- x = 1−z: then y = 0 → you play A0 when not delegating

Let’s evaluate E in both cases.

---

### **Case A: You play A0 when not delegating → x = 1−z, y = 0**

Then:
- E = 8x² + (−2 + 4z)x + (4 − 4z + 10z²)
- x = 1−z

So:
= 8(1−z)² + (−2 + 4z)(1−z) + (4 − 4z + 10z²)

Compute each term:

1. 8(1−2z+z²) = 8 − 16z + 8z²
2. (−2 + 4z)(1−z) = −2(1−z) + 4z(1−z) = −2 + 2z + 4z − 4z² = −2 + 6z − 4z²
3. 4 − 4z + 10z²

Sum all:
- Constants: 8 − 2 + 4 = 10
- z terms: −16z + 6z − 4z = −14z
- z² terms: 8z² − 4z² + 10z² = 14z²

So:
> E_A = 10 − 14z + 14z²

---

### **Case B: You play A1 when not delegating → x = 0, y = 1−z**

Then:
- x = 0
- E = 8(0) + (−2 + 4z)(0) + (4 − 4z + 10z²) = 4 − 4z + 10z²

So:
> E_B = 4 − 4z + 10z²

---

Now, compare E_A and E_B for z ∈ [0,1]

E_A = 10 − 14z + 14z²  
E_B = 4 − 4z + 10z²  

Compute difference:
E_A − E_B = (10 − 4) + (−14z + 4z) + (14z² − 10z²) = 6 − 10z + 4z²

Solve: 6 − 10z + 4z² > 0?

→ 4z² − 10z + 6 > 0

Divide by 2: 2z² − 5z + 3 > 0

Roots: z = [5 ± √(25−24)] / 4 = [5 ±1]/4 → z = 1.5 or z = 1

Discriminant: 25−24=1 → z = (5±1)/4 → z=1.5 or z=1 → wait:

Wait: quadratic formula: z = [5 ± √(25−24)] / (2*2) = [5 ±1]/4 → z=6/4=1.5 or z=4/4=1

But z ∈ [0,1], so for z < 1, 2z² −5z+3 > 0? At z=0: 3 >0, z=1: 2−5+3=0, z=0.5: 2(0.25)=0.5, −5(0.5)=−2.5, +3 → 1.0 >0

So for all z ∈ [0,1), E_A > E_B, and at z=1, E_A = E_B = 10 −14 +14 = 10, E_B = 4−4+10=10.

So **E_A ≥ E_B for all z ∈ [0,1]**, with equality only at z=1.

So **best choice for you (when not delegating) is to play A0 (x=1−z, y=0), not A1**.

Therefore, in optimal strategy, **when you don’t delegate, you play A0**.

So optimal strategy is: play A0 with prob 1−z, delegate with prob z, never play A1 directly.

So y = 0, x = 1−z.

Now, your total strategy is: play A0 with prob 1−z, delegate with prob z, and A1 with 0.

But now, we must consider: is **z** optimal?

So E(z) = E_A = 10 − 14z + 14z²

To maximize this, take derivative:

dE/dz = −14 + 28z

Set to zero: −14 + 28z = 0 → z = 0.5

Second derivative: +28 > 0 → minimum?

Wait! **Minimum?** But we want to **maximize**.

Wait — dE/dz = −14 + 28z

At z=0.5: derivative = 0

But second derivative positive → convex → so **minimum** at z=0.5

Then maxima at endpoints.

Since it's a parabola opening upward, **minimum at z=0.5**, maxima at endpoints z=0 or z=1.

Compute E at endpoints:

- z=0: E = 10 − 0 + 0 = 10
- z=1: E = 10 −14 +14 = 10
- z=0.5: E = 10 −14(0.5) +14(0.25) = 10 −7 + 3.5 = 6.5

So maximum is **10**, achieved at z=0 and z=1.

So best you can do is **10**, when you either always play A0 (z=0) or always delegate (z=1).

But wait — is that the **global maximum**?

But what about the **opponent's strategy**?

We assumed **symmetric** strategy (both use same z, same x=1−z, y=0)

But if both players use z=1 (always delegate), then:

- Both delegate → mediator plays A0
- You both get A0 → payoff 10 each → so you get 10.

If both use z=0 (never delegate), then both play A0 (since x=1, y=0), so both play A0, get 10.

So in both cases, payoff = 10.

But is 10 the best possible?

Wait — in the base game, if both play A0, payoff is 10 — but is there a better equilibrium?

But let’s check: could you do better by mixing?

But we already showed that for any z, best you can do is 10, and this is achieved by pure A0 or pure delegation.

But wait — if you are the only one who delegates, you get A1, but opponent might get something else.

But in symmetric equilibrium, we get 10.

But **can you get more than 10?**

Let’s think: suppose you **always delegate** (z=1)

Then:
- You always get:
  - A0 if opponent also delegates
  - A1 if opponent does not delegate

Now, **what does the opponent do?**

Suppose opponent **also delegates** (z=1). Then both get A0 → you get 10.

Suppose opponent **does not delegate** (plays A0 or A1)

Then:
- You get A1 (only 1 delegate)
- Opponent plays their action
- Your payoff: if opponent plays A0 → you get 6; if opponent plays A1 → you get 4

But if opponent is rational, they will choose their own strategy.

Suppose opponent is also trying to maximize their payoff.

Let’s suppose you **always delegate** (z=1)

Then the opponent has choices:
- Play A0: payoff = if you delegate → you get A1, opponent plays A0 → payoff (6, 2)
  - So opponent gets 2
- Play A1: you get A1, opponent plays A1 → payoff (4,4)
  - Opponent gets 4
- Delegate: you get A1, opponent gets A1 → payoff (4,4)

So opponent gets: 2 if play A0, 4 if play A1 or delegate.

So best for opponent is to play A1 or delegate → gets 4.

So if **you delegate always**, opponent will play A1 or delegate → gets 4.

Then, your payoff:
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 4 (since you play A1, opp plays A1)
- If opponent delegates → both delegate → you play A0 → payoff 10

But if opponent is rational, and you delegate, opponent can get 4 by playing A1 or delegating.

But which is better?

If opponent plays A1 → payoff 4

If opponent delegates → both delegate → they get A0 → payoff 10

So they get **10** by delegating.

So opponent will prefer to **delegate**, getting 10 > 4.

So if you delegate, opponent will also delegate → both get A0 → you get 10.

Similarly, if you do not delegate, and play A0, opponent will want to play A0 too? Let’s see.

If you play A0 (never delegate), opponent’s options:

- Play A0: (10,10) → gets 10
- Play A1: (0,20) → gets 20
- Delegate: gets A1 (if only one delegate), you play A0 → you get 6, opponent gets 2 → opponent gets 2

So opponent gets:
- A0: 10
- A1: 20
- Delegate: 2

So opponent will choose **A1**, getting 20.

Then you get 0.

So if you play A0, opponent will play A1 → you get 0.

So if you play A0, payoff = 0

But earlier we thought symmetric equilibrium with both playing A0 gives 10, but **that is not a Nash equilibrium**!

Because if you play A0, opponent can get 20 by playing A1, so they will.

So **(A0, A0) is not an equilibrium**.

In fact, the only **equilibrium** in the base game (without delegation) is **(A1, A1)**, with payoff (4,4), because:

- If you play A1, opponent:
  - A0 → gets 2
  - A1 → gets 4
  - Delegate → gets A1 (if only one delegate), you play A1 → (4,4)
  - So best is A1 → gets 4

Similarly, you get 4.

So (A1, A1) is NE, payoff 4.

But with delegation, we can do better.

Back to our earlier symmetric analysis.

We assumed symmetric strategy, but now we see that if both play A0, opponent will deviate to A1.

So in symmetric strategy, can we have z=1 (both delegate)?

Then both get A0 → you get 10.

But can opponent deviate?

Suppose opponent considers deviating: instead of delegating, play A1 (or A0).

If opponent deviates and plays A1 (instead of delegate), then:
- Only opponent delegates → mediator plays A1 → so opponent gets A1
- You are delegating → you get A1
- So both play A1 → payoff (4,4)

Opponent gets 4 < 10 → so no incentive to deviate.

Similarly, if opponent plays A0, then only opponent delegates → you get A1, opponent gets A1 → payoff (4,4) → opponent gets 4 < 10.

So **opponent has no incentive to deviate**.

Thus, **(delegate, delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Payoff: 10 for you.

Similarly, if both players use z=1, it's stable.

Now, what if you use z=1 (always delegate), and opponent plays A0?

Then:
- You get A1 (only one delegate)
- Opponent plays A0 → you get 6, opponent gets 2

But opponent could instead delegate, getting 10 > 2, so they will.

So **only equilibrium is when both delegate** (z=1).

Now, is there a better equilibrium?

Can you get more than 10?

Maximum possible in any outcome: 10 from (A0,A0)

So **10 is maximum possible payoff for you**.

And you achieve 10 by **always delegating** (z=1), and if opponent is rational, they will also delegate.

Thus, **best strategy is to always delegate**.

But what if opponent doesn't delegate?

Then you get A1, and opponent plays A0 (if they play A0), then you get 6.

But if opponent is rational, they will not play A0 — they will delegate to get 10.

So in equilibrium, both delegate → you get 10.

Thus, you should **always delegate**.

So your strategy is:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2 (Delegate): 100

Then, if opponent is rational, they will also delegate, giving you 10.

If they don't, you get 6 or 4, but since they are rational, they will.

Thus, **your best response** is to delegate with probability 1.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to **delegate with 100% probability**.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without Delegation**

We have a two-player game with actions:

- **A0** and **A1** for both players.
- Player 1 (you) wants to **maximize their own points**.
- Payoffs:

| Your Action | Other Player’s Action | Your Points | Other Player’s Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 10          | 10                     |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 20                     |
| A1          | A0                     | 6           | 2                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 4           | 4                      |

This is a simultaneous-move game. Let’s analyze it as a standard coordination/defection game.

But now, there's a **new action: A2 = Delegate to Mediator**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

You can choose to **delegate your move to a mediator**, via action **A2**.

The mediator plays:
- **A1** if **1 player** delegates to it.
- **A0** if **2 players** delegate to it.

Note: There are only 2 players. So either:
- 0 players delegate,
- 1 player delegates,
- 2 players delegate.

So what happens depends on **how many players** choose A2.

But this affects **your outcome**, because your action is determined by the mediator based on how many people (including you) delegated.

---

### **Step 3: Model the Strategic Situation**

Each player chooses:
- A0 (play A0),
- A1 (play A1),
- A2 (delegate to mediator).

You need to pick a strategy: a probability distribution over {A0, A1, A2}.

The key is that **the mediator's behavior depends on the total number of delegators**.

Since the game is symmetric in structure (both players face identical choices), and you’re trying to maximize your payoff, consider possible equilibria.

Let’s suppose *both* players play the same strategy (symmetric Nash equilibrium). We’ll test whether such an equilibrium exists where both choose A2 with some probability.

Let **p** be the probability that a player chooses A2 (delegate). You must decide p.

Then, from your perspective (Player 1), the probability of the **number of delegators** is:

- **0 delegees**: (1 - p)^2 → both play independently
- **1 delegee**: 2p(1 - p) → one delegates, one doesn’t
- **2 delegees**: p^2 → both delegate

Now, we need to compute **your expected payoff** under this strategy, taking into account:
- What the mediator does in each case.
- The actions taken by both players (either independently or through mediator).
- The resulting payoffs.

We assume **both players use the same mixed strategy**, so we are looking for a symmetric equilibrium.

---

### **Step 4: Compute Expected Payoff Based on Delegation Count**

Let’s denote your strategy: choose A2 with probability **p**, A0 with q, A1 with r, but since A0 + A1 + A2 = 100%, we can simplify: let’s define probabilities for A0, A1, A2 as x, y, z respectively, with x + y + z = 100.

But due to symmetry, it's easier to assume both players use the **same** strategy: (x, y, z), with z = p (delegation prob).

Then, for any given strategy profile, your expected payoff is computed by conditioning on the delegation count.

---

#### **Case 1: 0 players delegate (prob (1-p)^2)**

Both play independently.

You choose A0 with prob x, A1 with prob y.

Other player chooses A0 with prob x, A1 with prob y.

Your expected payoff in this case:

E_0 = x*x*10 + x*y*0 + y*x*6 + y*y*4  
= 10x² + 0 + 6xy + 4y²

#### **Case 2: 1 player delegates (prob 2p(1-p))**

One player (say, you) delegates; the other plays independently.

OR the other player delegates; you play independently.

By symmetry, both situations are equivalent.

So, **if you are the one who delegates**, then:
- Your action is determined by the mediator: since only one delegate, mediator plays **A1**.
- The other player plays independently (A0 with x, A1 with y).

So your payoff:
- If other plays A0 → you play A1 → payoff = 6
- If other plays A1 → you play A1 → payoff = 4
→ Expected payoff: x*6 + y*4

Similarly, if the **other player delegates**, then:
- They play A1 (since only one delegate).
- You play independently (A0 with x, A1 with y)
→ Your payoff:
- If you play A0 → other A1 → payoff = 0
- If you play A1 → other A1 → payoff = 4
→ Expected payoff: x*0 + y*4 = 4y

But since each scenario occurs with equal likelihood in the 1-delegate case (i.e., you delegate OR other delegates, each with prob p(1-p)), the **overall conditional expected payoff when exactly one delegates** is:
> [ (probability you delegate) * payoff_if_you_delegate ] + [ (probability other delegates) * payoff_if_other_delegates ]
=
[ p(1-p) / (2p(1-p)) ]? Wait, no — actually, in the conditional expectation over the case "exactly one delegate", the chance that *you* are the one is 0.5, and vice versa.

So the **expected value given exactly one delegate** is:

> (1/2)(payoff if you delegate) + (1/2)(payoff if other delegates)

= (1/2)(6x + 4y) + (1/2)(4y) = (1/2)(6x + 4y + 4y) = (1/2)(6x + 8y) = 3x + 4y

Wait! That’s only true if the event "exactly one delegate" has the two subcases equally likely — which it does in symmetric strategies.

So yes: given exactly one delegate (prob 2p(1-p)), your expected payoff is:
> 3x + 4y

But wait: actually, **you don't know** whether you or the other player is the one who delegated — but since you're computing your *own* payoff in this scenario, and your strategy includes whether you delegate or not, we need to condition properly.

Actually, better approach: **In the 1-delegate scenario, two possibilities**:
1. With probability 0.5 (given one delegate), *you* are the delegate → mediator plays A1 → your action is A1 → you get (x*6 + y*4) only if you’re playing A1? No — your action is **forced** to be A1 (via mediator), regardless of your strategy.

Clarify:

- When you **choose A2**, your action becomes **determined by the mediator**, based on the total number of delegators.
- So if **you** delegate and only one person delegates, then **you play A1** (mediator rule).
- If **you do not delegate**, but others do, then you act normally.

So in the case: “exactly one delegate”, and the delegate is **you**, then:
- You play A1 (by mediator action).
- Other player plays independently (A0 with prob x, A1 with y) → their action is random.

Then your payoff:
- If they play A0 → you play A1 → payoff = 6
- If they play A1 → you play A1 → payoff = 4
→ Expected: x*6 + y*4

If the delegate is **the other player**, then:
- The other plays A1 (based on mediator)
- You play independently: choose A0 with prob x, A1 with prob y
→ Your payoff:
- If you choose A0 → you get 0 (vs other A1)
- If you choose A1 → you get 4
→ Expected: x*0 + y*4 = 4y

Therefore, **conditional on exactly one delegate**, your expected payoff is:
= (probability you are the delegate) × (6x + 4y) + (probability other is delegate) × (4y)

Since symmetric, P(you delegate | exactly one) = 0.5, so:
E_1 = 0.5*(6x + 4y) + 0.5*(4y) = 3x + 2y + 2y = 3x + 4y

Yes, so E_1 = 3x + 4y

#### **Case 3: 2 players delegate (prob p²)**

Both delegate → mediator sees 2 delegators → plays A0 for **each** player.

So both players play A0.

Thus, payoff for you: 10 points.

No matter what you would have chosen, you’re forced to A0.

So E_2 = 10

---

### **Step 5: Total Expected Payoff for You**

Now sum up across all cases:

> E[Payoff] = 
> (1−p)² × E_0 + 2p(1−p) × E_1 + p² × E_2  
>
> = (1−p)² (10x² + 6xy + 4y²) + 2p(1−p)(3x + 4y) + p²(10)

But now, note: you are choosing x, y, z = p (prob of A2), where z = p, and x + y = 1 − p.

Also, x and y are part of your strategy — but we haven’t settled what x and y are.

So your full strategy is: assign probabilities to A0, A1, A2.

Let me redefine more clearly.

Let:
- **a** = P(A0) = probability you play A0
- **b** = P(A1) = probability you play A1
- **c** = P(A2) = probability you delegate = p

With a + b + c = 1

Now, in symmetric equilibrium, both players use same (a, b, c)

Then:
- Probability 0 delegates: (1−c)² → both play independently
  - Then your expected payoff: a*a*10 + a*b*0 + b*a*6 + b*b*4 = 10a² + 6ab + 4b²
- Probability 1 delegate: 2c(1−c)
  - Given one delegate, your expected payoff: (1/2)(6a + 4b) + (1/2)(4b) ? Wait — earlier we had E_1 = 3a + 4b ?

Wait — no. That was based on a, b being the independent action probs.

Yes, in the 1-delegate case:
- If **you delegate**, you play A1 → then your payoff vs other’s random action:
  - Other plays A0 with prob a → you get 6
  - Other plays A1 with prob b → you get 4
  → Expected: 6a + 4b
- If **other delegates**, they play A1 → you play independently:
  - You play A0 → get 0
  - A1 → get 4
  → Expected: 4b
- Since each scenario equally likely in the 1-delegate case, overall expected payoff: (6a + 4b + 4b)/2 = (6a + 8b)/2 = 3a + 4b

So yes, E_1 = 3a + 4b

- Probability 2 delegates: c²
  - Both play A0 → you get 10

So total expected payoff:

> E = (1−c)² (10a² + 6ab + 4b²) + 2c(1−c)(3a + 4b) + c²(10)

Now, you want to choose **a, b, c ≥ 0**, with **a + b + c = 1**, to maximize E.

Note: a and b appear in quadratic terms — possibly we can find optimal a and b **for fixed c**, then optimize over c.

Let’s consider candidate behaviors.

---

### **Step 6: Try Candidate Strategies**

Let’s consider if it makes sense to **always delegate** or **never delegate**.

#### Option 1: Always delegate → c = 1 → a = 0, b = 0

Then:
- E = (0)(...) + (0)(...) + (1)(10) = 10

→ You get **10 points**.

Is this sustainable?

If both always delegate → both play A0 → you get 10.

But suppose you deviate and instead play A0 with probability 1 → then:
- You play A0
- Other delegates → other plays A1 (since only one delegate)
→ You play A0, other A1 → you get 0

Worse than 10 → so not profitable.

If you play A1 → you play A1, other A1 → you get 4 < 10

So you wouldn't want to deviate.

So (c=1) can be stable?

But we must check if **any player wants to deviate**.

Suppose both play c=1 (always delegate). Then both play A0, get 10.

If you defect to A0 (independent play), then:
- You play A0
- Other plays A1 (because only one delegate? No — if you don’t delegate, and other delegates → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1
- So you play A0, other A1 → you get 0

Worse than 10 → bad.

If you defect to A1: same → you get 4 < 10 → bad.

So **no incentive to deviate**.

So (A2 with 100%) is **a credible strategy**, yielding **10 points**.

But can we do better?

Try another option.

#### Option 2: Never delegate → c = 0 → a + b = 1

Then no delegation → standard game.

You play A0 with prob a, A1 with prob b (a+b=1)

Expected payoff: 10a² + 6ab + 4b²

And you want to maximize this over a ∈ [0,1]

Note: b = 1−a

So E = 10a² + 6a(1−a) + 4(1−a)²  
= 10a² + 6a − 6a² + 4(1 − 2a + a²)  
= (10a² − 6a²) + 6a + 4 − 8a + 4a²  
= (4a²) + 6a + 4 − 8a + 4a²  
= (4a² + 4a²) + (6a − 8a) + 4  
= 8a² − 2a + 4

Now maximize E(a) = 8a² − 2a + 4 over a ∈ [0,1]

Derivative: 16a − 2 → set to 0 → a = 2/16 = 1/8

Check values:
- a=0 → E = 0 − 0 + 4 = 4
- a=1 → E = 8 − 2 + 4 = 10
- a=1/8 → E = 8*(1/64) − 2*(1/8) + 4 = 0.125 − 0.25 + 4 = 3.875

Minimum at a=1/8.

So maximum at boundary: **a=1 → E=10**, b=0

So best pure strategy: always play A0 → get 10

Same as delegation!

But what about mixed strategy in non-delegation mode?

Even if you mix a bit, worst than always A0.

So in non-delegation case, best is **A0 always → 10 points**

Same as always delegating.

So both strategies give 10?

But maybe we can do better with **mixing delegation and independent play**.

Try a different idea.

#### Option 3: Mix delegation with something

Suppose both players choose c = 0.5 → 50% chance to delegate.

Then try to compute E.

But we also need to choose a and b — should we set a and b?

Perhaps optimal to **not play A0 or A1 independently**, i.e., **only delegate or never play a pure action**.

That is, make a = 0, b = 0 → c=1 → already tried.

Or make a=0, c=p, b=1-p? Wait → a + b + c =1 → if a=0, then b+c=1

But let’s try to **minimize independent play**, perhaps only delegating.

But we suspect that 10 might be upper bound?

Wait — can we beat 10?

Let’s see if any scenario gives more than 10.

Only way: get more than 10 in some case, but balanced with lower elsewhere.

Suppose both players **randomize between A0 and delegate**.

Try a specific example.

Try: c = 0.5, a = 0.5, b = 0

So you play A0 with 50%, delegate with 50%

But b=0 → no A1

Now compute expected payoff.

First, probabilities:

- 0 delegates: (1−c)² = 0.5² = 0.25 → both play independently → you play A0 (prob 0.5), A1 (0) → so deterministic A0? No — your action is A0 with prob a=0.5, so in this case, each plays A0 with prob 0.5

So both randomly choose A0 with 50%

So E_0 = 10*(0.5)^2 + 6*(0.5)*(0.5) + 4*(0.5)^2  
= 10×0.25 + 6×0.25 + 4×0.25  
= 2.5 + 1.5 + 1.0 = 5.0

- 1 delegate: 2×0.5×0.5 = 0.5
  - Half the time you delegate → you play A1; other plays A0 (with prob 0.5) or A1 (0) → so other plays A0 with 0.5 → you get 6 if other A0, 4 if other A1 → expect: 0.5×6 + 0×4 = 3
  - Half the time other delegates → other plays A1 → you play A0 (prob 0.5) → so you get 0 if A0, 4 if A1 → but you never play A1 → so you play A0 → get 0
  → So expectancy: 0.5 × 3 + 0.5 × 0 = 1.5

- 2 delegates: c² = 0.25 → both play A0 → you get 10

Total E = 0.25×5 + 0.5×1.5 + 0.25×10 = 1.25 + 0.75 + 2.5 = 4.5

Worse than 10 → bad.

Try c=0.99, a=0.01, b=0 → almost always delegate.

Then:

- 0 del: (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 → E ≈ 10*(0.01)^2 + ... → very small contribution
- 1 del: 2×0.99×0.01 = 0.0198 → half you delegate (then you play A1), other plays A0 (0.01) → you get 6×0.01 + 4×0.99 = 0.06 + 3.96 = 4.02? But other plays A0 with prob 0.01 → so 0.01×6 + 0.99×4 = 0.06 + 3.96 = 4.02
  - Half other delegates → other plays A1 → you play A0 → get 0
  → average: (4.02 + 0)/2 = 2.01
- 2 del: (0.99)^2 ≈ 0.9801 → both play A0 → you get 10

Total E ≈ 0.0001× (small) + 0.0198×2.01 + 0.9801×10 ≈ 0.04 + 9.801 ≈ 9.84

Less than 10 → worse than always delegating.

So seems like **always delegating gives 10**, and any deviation reduces expected payoff.

Try a different strategy: what if both players **always play A1**?

Then: A1 vs A1 → both get 4

Worse.

Or if both play A0 → get 10 → same as delegation.

But delegation offers a coordination mechanism.

Wait — suppose **only one player delegates**.

Then:
- One delegate → plays A1 (mediator)
- Other plays independently.

But if the other plays A0 → you (delegated) play A1 → you get 6
If other plays A1 → you get 4

But if you can encourage cooperation...

Wait — here's a thought.

Suppose both players use a mixed strategy: **play A2 with high probability, but also sometimes play A0**.

But earlier trials suggest that deviations reduce payoff.

Let’s go back to the **Nash equilibrium analysis**.

Suppose both play **only A2 (delegate)** → then both get 10.

Is this a Nash equilibrium?

- If you unilaterally change to A0 (pure), then:
  - You play A0
  - Other plays A1 (because only one delegate → mediator plays A1)
  - So you get 0 → worse than 10 → not profitable

- Similarly, if you play A1 → get 4 → worse than 10

So **no incentive to deviate** → (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium, giving 10 points.

What about (A0, A0)? Both play A0 → get 10

- If you deviate to A1: you get 4 < 10 → won’t
- To A2? If you delegate, and other plays A0 → then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays A0 → you get 6 > 4, but 6 < 10 → still worse than 10 → so not profitable

Wait — **if you deviate to A2, while other plays A0**, then:
- One delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Other plays A0
→ You get 6 points

Which is less than 10 → so **still worse**.

So **no incentive to deviate** → (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But both give 10.

Can we have a **mixed strategy** equilibrium that gives more than 10?

Unlikely, because 10 is the highest possible payoff in any cell (10 is max for you).

Only two cells give you 10: (A0,A0), and (A0,A0) again.

All others give ≤ 6 or less.

So **maximum per-round payoff is 10**, and to get it, you must coordinate on (A0,A0).

But in the delegation case, when both delegate, you get (A0,A0) → 10

When only one delegates, you get either 6 or 4 depending on other’s move.

So **only when both delegate** do you get 10.

Otherwise, you get at most 6.

So in repeated play, if both keep delegating, you get 10 every time.

If you ever deviate, you risk getting less.

But **can we design a strategy that gets expected payoff > 10?** Impossible, since max per round is 10.

So **10 is upper bound**.

Now, is there a strategy that gives **higher than 10 in expectation**? No.

So **maximizing expected payoff** can never exceed 10.

We have strategies that achieve **10** (e.g., always delegate, or always play A0).

So we can achieve 10.

Now, the question is: **which strategy achieves 10 and is best for us?**

But the goal is to **maximize your total points**.

So any strategy achieving 10 is acceptable.

However, is **always delegating** strictly better than always playing A0?

In equilibrium sense: in (A0,A0), if you deviate to A2, you get 6 → still less than 10 → irrelevant.

But is there **an advantage to delegation**?

One advantage: delegation creates a coordination device.

For example, suppose there is an **asymmetric equilibrium**.

But we are to choose a strategy assuming the other player uses the same? Or not?

The prompt does **not** state that the other player follows the same strategy or is rational.

But we must **maximize expected points assuming best responses**.

But since the game is symmetric, likely the optimal is symmetric.

But we found **two symmetric equilibria giving 10**.

Now, is there a **dominant strategy**?

Suppose you always delegate → you get 10 **regardless of what the other player does**, as long as they play optimally?

No — if **they always play A0**, and you delegate → you get 10 (since only one delegate → you play A1? Wait!)

Hold on! This is critical.

Earlier assumption: **if only one delegate**, mediator plays A1.

So:

- You delegate → you play A1
- Other plays A0 → you get 6

→ **You get 6**, not 10!

Ah! This changes everything.

I think I made a critical error earlier.

Let’s re-express carefully.

#### **Corrected Mediator Rules:**

- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that player.
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

So if **you delegate alone** (and other does not), then:
- You play A1
- Other plays whatever they play (A0 or A1 or independent)

So you get:
- If other A0 → you get 6
- If other A1 → you get 4

Maximum you can get in this case is 6.

If **you delegate and other plays A0**, you get **6**.

If **you delegate and other plays A1**, you get **4**.

Only if **both delegate**, you get **10** (both play A0).

So:

- If you **always delegate** (c=1), and other **also always delegate** → you get 10 → good.
- But if other **does not delegate**, say plays A0 → then you are lone delegate → you play A1 → other plays A0 → you get 6 < 10 → worse.

Similarly, if other plays A1 → you get 4.

So your payoff if you delegate but other does **not** is at most 6, never 10.

So **to get 10, both must delegate**.

But if the other player is **irrational or does not delegate**, you get less.

So **delegating alone gives you at most 6**.

Whereas if you play A0 and the other plays A0, you get 10.

So **only when both commit to delegate** can you get 10.

So **delegation is risky** unless you can coordinate on mutual delegation.

But in a **non-cooperative setting**, it may not be safe.

Now, back to symmetric strategy.

Suppose both players use (A2 with probability c)

Then if c=1 → both delegate → both get 10 → good.

Is this stable?

Yes — as before: if you deviate to A0 → you get 0 (if other A1) or 6 (if other A0)? Wait — if other is still delegating → they play A1 (since only one delegate) → so if you play A0, other plays A1 → you get 0

Worse than 10 → so okay.

Similarly, if you play A1 → get 4 → worse.

So if both are supposed to delegate, and you deviate, you do worse.

So (A2, A2) is a symmetric Nash equilibrium, giving 10.

Similarly, (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium: if you deviate to A1 → get 4 < 10; to A2 → you get 6 or 4 < 10 → so also stable.

But now, which one is better?

Both give 10, but **delegation requires trust**.

But if we assume the other player will also follow symmetric strategy, then both are fine.

But perhaps we can do better with mixed strategy.

Try a new idea.

Suppose both players use a mixed strategy: **always play A0**, unless they have incentives to do otherwise.

But earlier calculation shows that playing A0 with certainty gives 10.

Alternatively, consider a **punishment** strategy.

But since we only care about maximizing expected payoff, and 10 is max, anything that yields less is worse.

But is there a strategy that yields more than 10 in expectation? **No**.

So any strategy that gives expected payoff > 10 is impossible.

Our job is to choose a strategy that maximizes your expected payoff.

Now, in symmetric equilibrium, both players play the same.

Let’s try to find a symmetric equilibrium where both players use a mixed strategy including delegation.

Suppose both players pick A2 with probability c.

We want to find c such that it’s optimal for you to mix.

But it’s complex.

Let’s try **c = 1** -> always delegate.

Then your payoff is 10 **only if the other also delegates**.

If the other is also playing c=1, then you get 10.

If the other is playing differently, you get at most 6.

So your expected payoff depends on the other player’s strategy.

Since we don’t control the other player, we must assume they might not cooperate.

But the instruction says: **"maximize your total points received"** — assuming the other player is also rational and plays strategically.

Likely we are to find a **best response** to the other player doing the same.

Or, if not, the safest assumption is **symmetric equilibrium**.

And in symmetric equilibrium, two options give 10: (A0,A0) and (A2,A2)

But is (A2,A2) **strictly better** than (A0,A0)?

In terms of payoff: same.

In terms of stability: both are stable.

But let’s see if there is a **better symmetric mixed strategy**.

Try a new idea: suppose both players play A2 with probability p.

But also, to avoid getting only 6, maybe play A0 with high probability.

Wait — the only way to guarantee high payoff is to coordinate on A0.

Perhaps the best is to **always play A0**, avoiding the risk of delegation.

Because if the other player might not delegate, you get only 6 or 4.

Whereas if you play A0, and they play A0, you get 10.

So in expectation, if there’s uncertainty, playing A0 might be safer.

But if both players are rational and believe the other will delegate, then mutual delegation works.

But without knowing, we must be cautious.

However, notice that in (A0,A0), you get 10 no matter what: even if they play A0, you get 10.

In (A2,A2), you get 10 only if they also delegate.

If you delegate and they don’t, you get at most 6.

So (A0,A0) is **more reliable**.

Moreover, in (A0,A0), if the other player deviates to A2, you can still get 0 (if they play A1) or 6, but you yourself get only 6 if they play A0.

But your strategy is fixed on A0.

So worst case, you get 0.

But you could have been at 10.

So not robust.

Given all this, and since we want to **maximize expected points**, and we cannot force the other to do anything, but we are to choose a strategy, probably the **safest and best-achievable** is to **always play A0**.

Because:
- It guarantees 10 if the other also plays A0.
- If the other plays A1, you get 0 — but that's the worst.
- But compared to delegation, it's better in the absence of cooperation.

However, in the **absence of a commitment device**, it's risky.

But in symmetric Nash equilibrium, both playing A0 is stable.

Similarly, both playing A2 is stable.

But the key insight: **when you delegate, you lose flexibility**.

For example, in the cell (A0, A0), you get 10.

In (A1, A0), you get 6.

In (A0, A1), you get 0.

In (A1, A1), you get 4.

So best for you is to play A0, and hope other plays A0.

Delegation forces you to either play A1 (alone) or A0 (with partner).

So only when partner also commits to delegate do you get 10.

Otherwise, you play A1 → which is good only if other plays A0.

But if other plays A1, you get 4.

So the variance is higher.

Given that, and since the maximum possible payoff is 10, and A1+A1 gives 4, best to **avoid risk**.

Therefore, the best strategy is to **always play A0**.

This ensures that if the other player plays A0, you get 10.

If they play A1, you get 0, but at least you are not forced into a bad action.

Furthermore, any deviation to delegation risks dropping to 6 or 4.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to **play A0 with 100% probability**.

So:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0, "A2": 0}

But let's double-check: is there any reason to delegate?

Suppose the other player is very likely to play A1.

Then if you play A0, you get 0.

If you delegate and they play A1, then you are lone delegate, play A1, they play A1, you get 4.

Better than 0.

So if other is likely to play A1, delegation might help.

But we don't know.

So in belief about the other player, we must act.

But the problem doesn't specify any prior beliefs.

So in the absence of information, the optimal strategy might be to play A0.

However, in game theory, for such games, often the dominant strategy is to play A0, as it is weakly dominant.

Let’s see:

- If other plays A0: you get 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) vs 6 (A2 alone) — so A0 best.
- If other plays A1: you get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) vs 4 (A2 alone) — so A1 or A2 better than A0.

So no pure strategy dominant.

But if you fear that the other might play A1, delegation gives you 4, same as A1.

While A0 gives 0.

So delegation is better than A0 if other likely to play A1.

But if you want to get 10, you need them to play A0.

So trade-off.

Perhaps a mixed strategy.

After extensive analysis, the equilibrium that gives the highest guaranteed payoff under symmetry is **both players playing A0 with probability 1**.

Because it’s a Nash equilibrium with payoff 10, and any deviation hurts.

Moreover, it’s simpler and more reliable.

Final decision:

**Always play A0**

So answer:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0, "A2": 0}

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step, carefully analyzing the game, the payoff structure, the role of mediators, and the approval voting process.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are Player 1 in a simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (from Player 1’s perspective):

|              | Other Player: A0 | Other Player: A1 |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **You: A0**  | 10               | 0                |
| **You: A1**  | 6                | 4                |

This is a standard game with the following characteristics:

- A0 vs A0: (10, 10)
- A0 vs A1: (0, 20)
- A1 vs A0: (6, 2)
- A1 vs A1: (4, 4)

Let’s look for Nash equilibria.

#### Best responses:
- If other plays A0: you prefer A0 (10 > 6) → best response: A0
- If other plays A1: you prefer A1 (4 > 0) → best response: A1

So the pure strategy Nash equilibria are:
- (A0, A0): both get 10 → but if you deviate to A1, you get 6, so not profitable. Others don’t want to deviate either → stable.
- (A1, A1): both get 4 → if you deviate to A0, you get 0. So no incentive.

Wait: (A0, A0) → if you deviate to A1 → you get 6, which is worse than 10 → so you *don’t* want to deviate.
If other deviates from A0 to A1 → they get 20, which is better than 10 → so **(A0, A0) is NOT a Nash equilibrium**, because other player has incentive to deviate.

Similarly, (A1, A1): both get 4. If you deviate to A0, you get 0 — worse. So no incentive.

Check: (A0, A1): you get 0, other gets 20. If you deviate to A1, you get 4 → better → so not equilibrium.

(A1, A0): you get 6, other gets 2. If other deviates to A1, they get 4 → better → so not equilibrium.

So **no pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s find mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let:
- You play A0 with probability p
- Other player plays A0 with probability q

Expected payoff for you:
- If you play A0: 10q + 0(1−q) = 10q
- If you play A1: 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Set equal for indifference:
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

Similarly, for other player:
- If they play A0: 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- If they play A1: 0p + 4(1−p) = 4 − 4p

Set equal:
8p + 2 = 4 − 4p → 12p = 2 → p = 1/6

So mixed strategy Nash equilibrium: you play A0 with prob 1/6, A1 with 5/6; other player plays A0 with 1/2, A1 with 1/2.

Your expected payoff: plug back in:
From playing A0: 10×0.5 = 5
From playing A1: 6×0.5 + 4×0.5 = 3 + 2 = 5

So expected payoff: 5

But this is **just background** — our main goal is to decide whether to **delegate** and which **mediators to approve**, under the new mechanism.

---

### **Step 2: Understanding the Delegation Mechanism**

- You and the other player **first** decide via **approval voting** which mediator(s) to approve.
- The **winner** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the *maximum* number of approvals.
- Then, you decide whether to **delegate** or act independently.
  - If you delegate, the **winning mediator** plays for you.
  - If you act independently, you choose your own action (with some probability, or mix).
- The **mediator’s action depends on how many players delegated to it**.

Now, we are **only** at the **approval voting stage**. We are to decide which mediators to approve.

There are **two mediators proposed**, both by different players:

- **Mediator M1**: Proposed by Player 1
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

- **Mediator M2**: Proposed by Player 2
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **They are identical in behavior**.

So both M1 and M2 have the **same rule**:
- 1 delegate → plays A1
- 2 delegates → plays A0

So they are **functionally the same**.

But the question is: **Do you approve them?**

You can approve both, one, or none. The winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with the most approvals.

So if you approve both, and the other player also approves both, then both have 2 approvals (max), so winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random between M1 and M2 → but since they are identical, it doesn't matter.

If you approve only one, and other approves both, then the one you approved has only 1, the other has 2 → the one with 2 wins → but only if others approve it.

But since you are only choosing **your own approvals**, we must consider:
- How this affects the **likelihood** that the winning mediator makes a **favorable** choice **FOR YOU**.
- But since the mediators are identical, it **doesn’t matter which one wins**, as long as they are both the same.

So ultimately, **the behavior of the mediator depends only on the number of delegations** — not on which mediator is chosen.

So as long as **a mediator is in the running**, and given that both behave the same, the outcome depends only on:
- How many players delegate to the mediator
- Whether the winning mediator is available

But since the mediator’s strategy doesn't depend on identity, only on delegation count, and both M1 and M2 behave identically, **approving one or both is equivalent**, provided that they are equally likely to be the one selected.

But the **number of approvals affects who wins**.

Let’s define the strategy space from here:

You will later choose to delegate or not. The other player will also choose (possibly based on your approval behavior).

But we are designing **your approval strategy**, with the goal of **maximizing your expected points**.

---

### **Step 3: Understanding the Interaction Between Approval and Delegation**

Let’s suppose you approve a mediator. That increases the chance it can win.

But if you approve it, and the other player approves it, and it’s selected, then **you can choose to delegate to it**.

But if you don’t approve it, it **cannot** be the winner (since only approved ones can be selected).

Important: **Only mediators with approvals can be selected.**

So your approval affects whether a mediator can win — and hence whether you can delegate to it.

But since both mediators behave **identically**, it makes **no difference** which one is selected.

So the only thing that matters is: Do you want to have **a mediator** available (i.e., win the approval vote) so that you can **optionally delegate**?

But here’s the rub: **You can only delegate if a mediator is available.** If no mediator wins, then delegation is not possible — you must act independently.

So the **value of approving a mediator** is in increasing the chance that a mediator is available to handle your choice.

But the mediator’s action is **determined by the number of delegations** — not by the identity.

So let’s consider: **What is your optimal strategy in the delegation game, assuming a mediator is available?**

Let’s suppose a mediator (M) is selected. It will:
- Play A1 if only **one** player delegates
- Play A0 if **two** players delegate

So it essentially **creates a coordination mechanism**:
- If you both delegate, it picks A0
- If only one delegates, it picks A1
- If neither delegates, the mediator doesn’t act — you must act independently.

Now, **if you choose to delegate**, you are guiding the mediator’s action based on the number of delegations.

Let’s model the decision:

After approval voting, a mediator is selected (say M1 or M2, doesn’t matter).

Then:
- You and other player each choose: delegate or not
- Then mediator plays based on how many delegations (1 or 2)

We want to **maximize your payoff**.

Let’s suppose a mediator is available. Should you delegate?

Let’s consider possible outcomes depending on delegate choices.

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate Delegation vs Independent Play (Given a Mediator Exists)**

Let’s suppose a mediator **is available** (i.e., approved by someone, and was selected).

Now you decide: delegate or act independently.

Similarly, the other player decides.

Suppose you **delegate**. Then your action is determined by the mediator, based on the **number of delegations**.

Let’s analyze the possible cases:

#### Case 1: You delegate, Other player delegates
→ 2 delegations → mediator plays A0
→ You play A0; other plays A0
→ Payoff: You get 10

#### Case 2: You delegate, Other player does not delegate
→ Only 1 delegation → mediator plays A1
→ You play A1; other plays whatever they play (independent)
You chose to delegate → so your action is A1
Other player acts independently → so they can choose A0 or A1. But we need to model what they do.

Ah — here’s a problem: **We don’t know what the other player will do** — but we’re trying to decide our own approval.

We must anticipate the other player’s actions.

But to make progress, we assume **rational players** acting to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s suppose **you delegate**.

Then your action is determined by the mediator:
- If only you delegate → A1
- If both delegate → A0

Now, you will also want to anticipate what the other player will do **given** that you delegate or not.

Let’s suppose **both you and other player are rational**.

Let’s suppose the mediator is available.

Can there be a **coordinated outcome** under delegation?

Let’s consider possible pure strategy equilibria in the delegation game.

Let’s define the game **after mediator is selected** (with the mediator behavior above).

Strategies:
- You: delegate or not
- Other: delegate or not

Payoffs:

| You \ Other | Delegate | Not Delegate |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **Delegate** | You get: A0 vs A0 → 10 | You get: A1 vs (their action) |
| **Not Delegate** | You get: (your action) vs A0 | You get: (your action) vs (their action) |

But we need to know what the other player will do in each case.

Let’s suppose you delegate.

Then:
- If other delegates → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → you get 10
- If other does not delegate → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get: ? depending on other’s play

But other player, if they do **not** delegate, will choose their own action.

So we must consider **what other player does when not delegating**.

And they will choose to **maximize their own payoff**.

So let’s suppose other player is rational and knows the rules.

Let’s suppose the entire game is **common knowledge**.

Let’s consider **subgame perfect equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose you **will delegate**.

Then you can **commit** to A0 only if both delegate, A1 if only you delegate.

Now, the other player considers:
- If they delegate: then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → they play A0 → they get: 10
- If they do **not** delegate:
  - Then you are delegating → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
  - So other player faces: you play A1, they choose A0 or A1
    - If they play A0: you get A1, they get A0 → you get 6, they get 2
    - If they play A1: both A1 → you get 4, they get 4
  → So if they don’t delegate, and you are delegating (so you play A1), their best response is to play A1 → they get 4
    (vs 2 if they play A0)

So if you delegate and other does not delegate → other gets 4

But if other delegates → they get 10

So their best response: **delegates**, because 10 > 4

So if you delegate, the other player will also delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get 10, other gets 10

→ So **if you delegate, rational other will delegate too**, and both get 10

Now, suppose you **do not delegate**.

Then you can choose your own action.

But other player will make their decision.

Let’s suppose you **do not delegate**.

Then other player sees: you are not delegating → so they choose to delegate or not.

Case: other delegates

→ Only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → they play A1

Then you play your own action (non-delegate, so you decide)

You face: other plays A1

- If you play A0: you get 0
- If you play A1: you get 4

So best response: play A1 → get 4

Case: other does not delegate

Then both act independently.

So you choose A0 or A1, other chooses A0 or A1.

We already saw earlier there's no pure NE, but best response depends.

But if you don’t delegate and other doesn’t delegate, then it reduces to the base game.

What is the optimal choice?

But we are trying to compare: If you delegate, you get 10 (if other delegates, which they will)

But in the no-delegate case, you might get less.

So let’s compute:

If you **do not delegate**, and the other player tries to maximize their payoff.

Suppose you don’t delegate.

Then the other player chooses: delegate or not.

- If they delegate: then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → they play A1
  - You respond: face A1, you get 0 (if you play A0), 4 (if you play A1) → so you play A1 → get 4
  - So other player gets: when they play A1 and you play A1 → 4

- If they do not delegate: then both act independently.
  - They will choose an optimal strategy in the base game.

But recall: in the base game, the mixed strategy NE gives payoff **5** to both.

But can they get better?

Let’s suppose they play A1 always.

Then you will respond with A1 → both get 4

Or if they play A0 always → you respond with A0 → both get 10

But if other plays A0, you get 10 — best

But if other plays A0, but you are not delegating, you could play A0 → you get 10

But the other player, if they play A0, and you play A0 → they get 10

So if you both play A0 → both get 10

But is that a Nash equilibrium? Earlier we saw: (A0, A0): if you deviate to A1, you get 6 < 10 → no incentive; if they deviate to A1, they get 20 > 10 → so yes, **other player has incentive to deviate**.

So (A0, A0) is **not** stable.

Similarly, if other player plays A0, but you play A1, you get 6 → so you have incentive to deviate.

But in the non-delegation case, if other player wants to play A0, they know: if they play A0, you can play A0 or A1.

If they play A0, then:
- Your best response: if they play A0, you want A0 (10 > 6) → so you play A0

So if they play A0, you play A0 → they get 10

But if they instead play A1, and you play A1 → you get 4, they get 4

So if they think you will respond rationally, then:
- If they play A0 → get 10
- If they play A1 → get 4 (if you play A1)

So they prefer A0 → so they will play A0.

But then you play A0 → they get 10

So (both play A0) is a Nash equilibrium *if* both choose their actions optimally.

But wait: if other player plays A0, you get 10 for A0, 6 for A1 → so you play A0 → fine.

If you play A0, other gets 10 for A0, 20 for A1 → so other has incentive to play A1 → violation!

So if you play A0, other player’s best response is A1 (get 20 > 10)

So even though other would prefer to play A0 if they think you play A0, but they know that if they play A1, they get 20.

But if they play A1, and you play A0 → you get 0 → so you have incentive to deviate to A1

So no pure strategy NE.

But in **sequential rationality**, if the game is simultaneous, players may end up in correlated or mixed strategies.

But for now, let’s suppose that when **neither delegates**, both will play their mixed strategies, and expected payoff is **5** each.

Alternatively, if they play A1, both get 4 — worse than 5.

Or if both play A0: each gets 10, but unstable.

But since it’s a one-shot game, players will not deviate? Not necessarily.

But in practice, **players know they will not play A0 unless the other does too**, but since payoff to deviating is high (20), it’s unstable.

Thus, **the only stable outcome** is the mixed equilibrium: both play mixed, get expected payoff 5.

So if neither delegates, both get approximately 5.

Now, back to the delegation case:

If you delegate, and the other player is rational, they will **also delegate** → you both get 10.

If you do **not** delegate, and neither delegates → you get 5 (expected).

Or even worse: if other delegates, you get 4.

But in no case can you get more than 10 in non-delegation.

But in delegation, you **guarantee 10**, **if the other player is rational and accepts the mediator mechanism**.

So **your expected payoff is higher if you delegate** — you get 10 guaranteed, vs ~5 if you don’t.

Therefore, **you should delegate**, **if a mediator is available**.

Similarly, the other player, as we saw, also gets 10 if they delegate (and you do), which is better than 4 or 5.

So **rational players will both choose to delegate** if a mediator is available.

Thus, **if a mediator is approved and available, both will delegat**e → mediator plays A0 → you get 10.

So **the benefit of having a mediator is that it enables coordination on (A0, A0)**, which is better than any other outcome.

Without mediation, the only stable outcome is mixed strategy with payoff 5.

With mediation, you can coordinate on 10.

So mediator is **highly valuable**.

---

### **Step 5: Approval Voting — What Should You Do?**

You can approve M1 and/or M2.

But both behave **identically**.

Now, suppose you **do not approve any mediator**.

Then no mediator wins → delegation is not possible → you must act independently → expected payoff ~5

But if you **approve one or both**, you increase the chance that a mediator is selected (and thus available for delegation).

But the **other player** also approves.

You don’t know what they will do.

But you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

The best outcome is: **a mediator is available and you both delegate → you get 10**

The worst is: no mediator → you get 5

So you want to **increase the probability** that a mediator is available.

But if you approve **no one**, then no mediator exists → you get only 5.

If you approve at least one, and the other player approves at least one, and the one you approve has enough approvals, it might win.

But here’s the catch: **The winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.**

Suppose:
- You approve M1
- Other player approves M2

Then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 1 → max is 1 → winning mediator is chosen uniformly from {M1, M2} → so with 50% chance M1 wins, 50% M2 wins.

But since both behave identically, it doesn't matter.

So mediator is available.

Then both players, being rational, will delegate → you get 10.

Similarly, if **you approve both**, and other approves both, then max approvals = 2, so winner chosen randomly → still mediator available → you get 10.

If you approve both, but other approves only one, then that one has 2 approvals, you have 2 (if you approve both), so max is 2 → the one they approved wins → still mediator available.

But if you approve **only M1**, and other approves **only M2**, then both have 1 → max = 1 → random winner → mediator available.

The **only case** when no mediator is available is when **no one approves any mediator**, or if all approvals are zero.

But if **you approve at least one**, and **at least one other person approves at least one**, then there will be a mediator available.

But the **other player** may not approve anything.

We don’t know what they will do.

But — **your goal is to maximize your expected payoff**.

So you must consider possible scenarios.

Let’s suppose the **other player** is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff.

They will **approve mediators** if it can help them get higher payoff.

Suppose the other player thinks: "If a mediator is available, I can get 10 (if I delegate, and so does the other), which is better than 5."

So they have **incentive to approve** at least one mediator.

In fact, **they will want to approve a mediator** to increase the chance of the coordination outcome.

So likely, other player approves at least one.

But **to be safe**, you should consider: **what is best if other player approves nothing?**

If other player approves nothing, and you approve nothing → no mediator → you get 5

If you approve one (say M1), and other approves nothing → then M1 has 1 approval, others have 0 → so M1 wins → mediator is available → you can delegate → and if other player is rational, they will also delegate → you get 10

Similarly if you approve both.

So **even if the other player approves nothing, if you approve at least one, a mediator is selected** (the one with highest approvals), and available.

Therefore, **by approving at least one mediator, you guarantee that a mediator is available**, **regardless of what the other player does**.

And since mediators are identical, it doesn’t matter which one.

Then, **if a mediator is available**, rational players will delegate → you get 10.

The only way you get less than 10 is if no mediator is available → i.e., **if you approve no mediators**.

In that case, no mediator → you must act independently → you get at most 5.

So **by approving at least one mediator, you ensure you can get 10**.

By approving **none**, you **guarantee only 5**.

Therefore, **you should approve at least one**.

But since both M1 and M2 are identical, and you get the same benefit from either, **you should approve both**, because:
- It ensures that even if other player approves only one, you still have multiple with approval → still a mediator wins
- But more importantly, **if you approve both**, and other approves both, you are not relying on others — you’re safe.

But the key point is: **as long as you approve at least one, you are guaranteed a mediator wins**, because **your approval makes it non-zero**, and the maximum will be at least 1, so some mediator is selected.

**Even if other player approves nothing**, your approval gives you a mediator.

**Therefore, approving at least one is necessary and sufficient** to ensure a mediator is available.

But now: **Do you need to approve both?**

Suppose you approve only M1.

- If other player approves M1 → M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → good
- If other player approves M2 → M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → max=1 → winner random → good
- If other player approves nothing → M1 has 1, others 0 → M1 wins → good

So **as long as you approve at least one**, mediator exists.

But what if **you approve M1 and M2**, and other approves nothing? → both have 1 approval → max=1 → random winner → still good.

So no downside to approving both.

But is there any downside?

Only if **the mediator behaves differently**, but they don't.

Since both are identical, **there is no cost to approving both**.

In fact, you **maximize your guarantee** — you ensure that **no matter what the other player does**, a mediator wins.

Whereas if you approve only one, and the other player **also approves only one (M2)**, then still M1 and M2 both have 1 → max=1 → random winner → same.

So **preserving both options is harmless**.

Moreover, suppose the other player is strategic and may **only approve M2**, trying to avoid your preferred one.

But since both behave identically, it doesn’t matter.

So **approving both mediators is safe and beneficial** — it doesn’t hurt, and just increases the number of approved mediators.

But wait: the winning mediator is selected **uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So if you approve both, and other approves both, then both have 2 approvals → winner random → 50-50.

But since identical, no difference.

But if you approve **only one**, and other approves the other, maximum is still 1 → random winner → same.

So **no difference in outcome**.

Therefore, **approval of both is equivalent to approval of one**, in terms of outcome.

But **is there a reason not to approve one? Only if you think it might cause harm** — but here, no.

So to **minimize risk**, you should approve both.

But even better: **you are Player 1**, and the mediators are proposed by Player 1 and Player 2.

But that doesn’t matter — players are rational.

Final reasoning:

- Approving at least one mediator ensures that a mediator is selected (since your approval > 0)
- Once a mediator is selected, you and the other player will **both delegate**, getting 10
- Without any approval, no mediator → you get only 5
- Since the mediators are **identical in behavior**, approving one or both makes no difference in outcome
- But **approving both** ensures that **even in all scenarios**, a mediator will be available
- There is **no drawback** to approving both

Therefore, **you should approve both mediators**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P1
response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand what happens with delegation

The mediator plays:
- **A1** if only 1 player delegates
- **A0** if both players delegate

## Step 2: Calculate my expected payoffs for each action

**If I play A0** against other player's mixed strategy (q0, q1, q2):
- vs A0: 10 points
- vs A1: 0 points  
- vs A2 (mediator plays A1 for them): 0 points
- Expected: 10q0

**If I play A1:**
- vs A0: 6 points
- vs A1: 4 points
- vs A2 (mediator plays A1): 4 points
- Expected: 6q0 + 4q1 + 4q2 = 6q0 + 4(1-q0) = 2q0 + 4

**If I play A2 (delegate):**
- vs A0: 6 points (mediator plays A1 for me)
- vs A1: 4 points (mediator plays A1 for me)
- vs A2: 10 points (mediator plays A0 for both)
- Expected: 6q0 + 4q1 + 10q2

## Step 3: Compare A2 vs A1

A2 gives: 6q0 + 4q1 + 10q2
A1 gives: 6q0 + 4q1 + 4q2
Difference: 6q2

**A2 weakly dominates A1** (equal when q2=0, better when q2>0)

## Step 4: Analyze from Player 2's perspective

Player 2's payoffs:
- A0 vs my actions: 10p0 + 2p1 + 2p2
- A1 vs my actions: 20p0 + 4p1 + 4p2  
- A2 vs my actions: 20p0 + 4p1 + 10p2

For Player 2, **A2 weakly dominates A1** by 6p2, and A1 strictly dominates A0.

## Step 5: Check Nash Equilibrium at (A2, A2)

If both players delegate (play A2):
- Both get 10 points (mediator plays A0 for both)

Is this a Nash equilibrium?
- If Player 2 plays A2, my payoffs are: A0→0, A1→4, **A2→10** ✓
- If I play A2, Player 2's payoffs are: A0→2, A1→4, **A2→10** ✓

Both players' best response is A2!

## Step 6: Compare to alternatives

Without delegation, the original game has no pure strategy equilibrium leading to cooperation. Player 2 prefers A1, driving us to (A1,A1) with payoff (4,4).

With delegation, (A2, A2) achieves the cooperative outcome (10,10) as a Nash equilibrium.

## Conclusion

Playing A2 (delegating to the mediator) is optimal because:
1. It weakly dominates A1
2. When both players delegate, we achieve the best mutual outcome (10,10)
3. It's a Nash equilibrium

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

response:
Let's break this down step by step, carefully analyzing the game, the payoffs, the mediator behaviors, and the approval voting process.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)

This is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1, and the following payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff first, Player 2's second):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

We are Player 1.

Let’s analyze best responses:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1 gets 10 for A0, 6 for A1 → prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1 gets 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So Player 1 has no pure strategy dominant strategy.

But note: the game is *not* symmetric. Player 2 benefits more from Player 1 choosing A0 (they get 20 in (A0,A1)), while Player 1 only gets 0 in that case.

We can look for Nash equilibria.

Let’s suppose both players mix. Let:

- p = probability Player 1 plays A0
- q = probability Player 2 plays A0

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- EU1(A0) = 10q + 0(1−q) = 10q
- EU1(A1) = 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Player 1 is indifferent when:
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

Similarly, for Player 2:
- EU2(A0) = 10p + 2(1−p) = 8p + 2
- EU2(A1) = 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → −8p = 2 → p = −0.25 → impossible.

So no symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium? Wait — maybe we made a mistake.

Wait: Player 2’s payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A1,A0): 2
- (A0,A1): 20
- (A1,A1): 4

So if Player 1 plays A0 with prob p, Player 2’s expected payoff:
- A0: p×10 + (1−p)×2 = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- A1: p×20 + (1−p)×4 = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal for indifference: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → −8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → impossible.

So Player 2 **never** mixes. Since 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 for all p ≥ 0, Player 2 **always prefers A1**.

Therefore, Player 2 will play A1 with probability 1.

Then Player 1’s best response:
- A0: 0 (since Player 2 plays A1)
- A1: 4

So Player 1 will play A1.

Thus, the **unique Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1), giving (4,4).

But is this stable? What if Player 1 thought Player 2 might play A0?

But if Player 2 can commit to A1, they should — it’s strictly better than A0 unless Player 1 plays A0. But even if Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 20 vs. 2 — so A1 is better regardless.

So (A1, A1) is the unique Nash equilibrium.

But is it the best outcome for Player 1? No. Player 1 gets only 4.

Can we do better with delegation?

---

### Step 2: Understand the delegation twist

Now, players can **delegate** their actions to a **mediator**, but **only one mediator** will be selected — the one approved by the most players.

To select the mediator, we go through **approval voting**: each player approves some mediators; the one(s) with the **most approvals** are candidates; one is chosen uniformly at random.

We have two mediators proposed:

- **M1 (by Player 1)**:  
  - If 1 player delegates to it → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate to it → plays A0  

- **M2 (by Player 2)**:  
  - If 1 player delegates to it → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate to it → plays A0  

So **both mediators behave identically**!  
- 1 delegate → play A1  
- 2 delegates → play A0

So M1 and M2 are **functionally identical** in behavior.

Therefore, they are **indistinguishable in outcome**.

So why would one be better than the other?

Because **they are proposed by different players**, and perhaps there is **strategic motivation** to approve one over the other **based on intent**, **but not output**.

But we only care about **our expected points**.

Since both mediators behave the same way, the **expected payoff from delegating to M1 or M2 is the same**.

Therefore, **our approval decision should not depend on the behavior** — only on **strategy**, **predicting what others will do**, and **maximizing our own points**.

But the approval voting selects the mediator **from all approved mediators**, then the mediator plays based on **how many players delegated to it**.

Let’s consider what happens in various situations.

---

### Step 3: Possible outcomes based on delegation decisions

Let’s suppose we are Player 1. We can either:
- Act independently (choose a mixed strategy over A0 and A1)
- Delegate to a mediator (but only one mediator will be selected, and we can only delegate if we approve it)

But wait — **we must approve mediators before any delegation happens**. Then, after approval voting, the winning mediator (chosen uniformly at random from the most-approved ones) is activated.

Then, **each player decides** whether to **delegate to that mediator** or play independently.

But **the rules are unclear**: do we decide to delegate **after** the mediator is chosen?

Let’s re-read:

> "First, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game."

Then:
> "If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it."

So the **mediator is selected via approval voting**, then **after that**, the two players decide whether to delegate (or not).

Therefore, approval happens **before** the delegation decision.

We are asked: **decide which mediators to approve**.

But which ones matter? Only the ones that end up being selected.

So our approval strategy must consider: **which mediator is more likely to be selected**, and **how that affects our *optimal* delegation behavior**.

But since both M1 and M2 behave the **same**, **the outcome of the game depends only on which mediator is selected**, but since they behave identically, **it doesn’t matter**.

So for **game outcome**, M1 and M2 are **identical**.

But wait — could there be **strategic reasons to favor one over the other**?

Let’s think: what if we approve only M1, but the other player approves only M2?

Then both M1 and M2 receive 1 approval each → both are tied for most approvals → both are candidates → **winner is chosen uniformly at random** → 50% chance M1, 50% M2.

But since they behave the same, it doesn’t matter.

Similarly, if we approve M1 only, and the other player approves M1 only → M1 wins → mediator is M1.

Same outcome as if M2 won.

So the **only thing that matters is the number of approvals**, but **not which one** — because behavior is identical.

Therefore, **from our point of view, approving M1 vs M2 is symmetric**.

But is there a reason to approve one over the other?

Only if one is **more likely to be selected** due to our own approval voting, but since the mediators behave the same, and we can’t distinguish them, the only difference is **who proposed them**.

But that doesn’t affect the behavior.

So, regardless of which mediator ends up being active, the result is the same.

Therefore, **our approval decision should not bias toward one specific mediator** — unless there is an incentive to **influence the selection** to make delegation more attractive.

But here’s a twist: since both mediators are identical, we could approve both, or only one, or neither.

But we want to **maximize the chance that a mediator we prefer to delegate to is selected**.

But since both behave exactly the same, **we have no preference**.

Therefore, **we can approve both, or neither, or one — as long as we maximize our expected points**, which depends on the **likelihood of delegation** and **the interaction**.

But here’s a critical point: **we are in an approval vote**, and our goal is to **maximize our expected total points**, over the entire game.

So we must consider: **what will happen after the mediator is selected**?

We must **consider strategies in the delegation stage**, based on who is selected.

But since the selected mediator behaves the same regardless of identity, we can ignore the label.

So after the mediator is chosen (call it "the mediator"), each of us decides: delegate or not.

If we delegate, the mediator plays:
- A1 if only **one** of us delegates to it
- A0 if **both** delegate to it

If we do **not** delegate, we play independently — we can choose any mixed strategy.

But now we have to think about strategic delegation.

Let’s suppose the mediator is chosen. We don’t know which — but since M1 and M2 behave the same, it doesn't matter.

So suppose a mediator is selected.

Now, we (Player 1) and the other player decide whether to delegate.

Let’s assume both players act rationally and selfishly (maximizing their own points).

We must compute **what equilibrium will arise in the delegation stage**, given the chosen mediator.

---

### Step 4: Analyze the delegation stage (after mediator selected)

After the mediator is selected (it doesn’t matter which, since behavior is identical), the two players decide independently whether to delegate.

Let’s denote:
- If you delegate, the mediator plays:
  - A1 if only one player delegates
  - A0 if both delegate
- If you do **not** delegate, you can choose any action (A0 or A1), and you get the corresponding payoff.

Now, since both players are rational and selfish, we can model this as a game.

Let’s define the possible strategies:

Each player has two choices: Delegate (D) or Not Delegate (ND)

But if you don't delegate, you choose an action — to maximize your own payoff.

So the game is: for each player, choose D or ND. If ND, then choose a best-response action.

Let’s compute the outcomes.

#### Case 1: Both players delegate (D, D)
- Then both delegated → mediator plays A0
- So both players get: (10, 10)

#### Case 2: You delegate, other does not
- Only one delegate → mediator plays A1
- You get: 6 (since you play A1, other plays A0? Wait — no)

Wait: The mediator plays **for the delegatee**, but the **other player** plays their own action.

Important: The delegation **only affects the delegating player**.

So if you delegate, then the mediator plays, and **you get that result**.

The other player, if not delegating, chooses **their own action** — selfishly.

So in combination:

Let’s define:

- If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not:
  - Mediator plays A1 (since 1 delegate)
  - So Player 1 plays A1
  - Player 2 chooses any action (A0 or A1) to maximize their own payoff
  - Player 1 gets: depends on Player 2's action
  - But Player 1 cannot control Player 2's choice

So we have to assume Player 2 will choose an action **best for them** given Player 1’s action.

So if Player 1 delegates → makes A1

Then Player 2 chooses between:
- A0: get 2 (since (A1, A0) → (6,2))
- A1: get 4 (since (A1, A1) → (4,4))

So Player 2 will choose A1 → gets 4 > 2

So outcome: (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets 4, Player 2 gets 4

But wait — Player 1 is **forced** to A1 by the mediator, and Player 2 responds by playing A1.

So Player 1 gets 4.

Similarly, if Player 1 does not delegate, but Player 2 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 2 plays A1

Then Player 1 chooses:
- A0 → gets 0 (since (A0, A1) → (0,20))
- A1 → gets 4 → so chooses A1
→ outcome (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets 4

Now, Case 3: Player 1 delegates, Player 2 does not

- Player 1: forced to A1
- Player 2: sees that Player 1 is playing A1, so plays A1 (best response) → gets 4
→ Player 1 gets 4

Case 4: Player 1 does not delegate, Player 2 delegates

- Player 2: forced to A1
- Player 1: sees Player 2 choosing A1, so plays A1 (gets 4) rather than A0 (gets 0)
→ outcome (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets 4

Case 5: Both delegate
- Both are forced to A0 (since 2 delegates)
- So both play A0
- Payoff: (10,10)

Case 6: Neither delegates
- Then both play independently
- As we found earlier, rational players will play (A1, A1) → (4,4)

Now, let’s write the payoff matrix for the delegation game (Player 1, Player 2), where payoffs are (Player 1, Player 2):

|           | P2: D | P2: ND |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **P1: D** | (10,10) | (4,4)   |
| **P1: ND**| (4,4)   | (4,4)   |

Wait — that’s interesting.

- (D, D): both delegate → both get 10
- (D, ND): you delegate, other doesn’t → you get 4, other gets 4
- (ND, D): you don’t delegate, other does → you get 4, other gets 4
- (ND, ND): neither delegates → both play A1, get 4

So **the only outcome where anyone gets more than 4 is when both delegate → both get 10**

But is (D, D) a Nash equilibrium?

Check:

- If Player 1 thinks Player 2 will delegate, then:
  - If Player 1 delegates: gets 10
  - If Player 1 does not delegate: gets 4
  → so Player 1 wants to delegate

Similarly for Player 2.

So yes — (D, D) is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Now, is (ND, ND) an equilibrium?

- If Player 2 plays ND, then Player 1:
  - If Player 1 delegates: gets 4
  - If Player 1 plays ND: gets 4
  → so indifferent
- But if Player 1 is indifferent, do they delegate? We must assume they play best response.
  - Since D gives same payoff as ND, they might choose either.

But if both play ND, and one unilaterally deviates to D, they get 4 — same as before.

So **(ND, ND) is also a Nash equilibrium**, though weak.

But here’s the **key**: in (D, D), both get 10 — better than 4.

So (D, D) is a **Pareto-optimal equilibrium**.

Therefore, **if both players can coordinate to delegate, they can both get 10**.

But **can they coordinate?**

Not necessarily — unless they have reason to trust each other.

But since this is a decision-making game, and we assume rational players, **(D, D)** is a plausible outcome.

In fact, if both players expect the other to delegate, then they want to delegate too.

So **(D, D) is a strongly focal equilibrium**.

But could they both play ND?

Yes — but they get only 4.

So **rational players should be able to coordinate on (D, D)** to get 10.

Therefore, the **most likely outcome (in equilibrium)** is **both delegate**, and the mediator plays A0, both get 10.

But wait — what if only one delegates?

Then the one who delegates is forced to A1, the other plays A1, so both get 4.

So both prefer both to delegate.

Therefore, **if both players approve the mediator and the mediator is selected, and they both delegate, they both get 10.**

Now, what if the mediator is **not** selected?

That happens only if **no one approves any mediator**, or if **we don’t approve** the mediator that is selected.

But our goal is to **maximize our expected points**, so we must consider: **what is the probability that the mediator is selected**, and **what happens if not**.

But if the mediator is not selected, then delegation is not available — so we play the original game.

In the original game, as we found earlier, Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) → both get 4.

So if no mediator is selected, we both get 4.

Now, if a mediator **is** selected, and both players delegate, we both get 10.

So we **want** the mediator to be selected and both to delegate.

But **can we influence the selection**?

Yes — **via approval voting**.

Now, recall: each player approves some mediators.

Then the mediator(s) with **maximum number of approvals** are selected; one is chosen uniformly at random.

So if we approve a mediator, it increases its chance of being selected.

But we want to **increase the chance that a mediator is selected** (so we can delegate and get 10).

But note: both M1 and M2 are identical. So we don’t care which one is selected.

But **we can influence the approval count**.

Now, here’s the **crucial point**: the other player is also rational and wants to maximize their points.

We must **predict their strategy**.

Let’s suppose the other player has the same preferences as us: wants to maximize their expected points.

So they will also want to approve mediators that can help them get more.

But now, if **both** of us approve the same mediator, they get 2 approvals — tie with other mediators.

But if we approve one, and they approve the other, then both mediators get 1 approval — still tied.

But if we **approve both**, we increase the chance that the **set of approved mediators is large**.

But to **win selection**, a mediator must have **maximum number of approvals**.

Let’s consider possible approval choices.

Suppose we **approve both M1 and M2**.

Then, no matter what the other player does:
- If they approve nothing → then M1 and M2 each get 1 approval → both are tied → both are candidates → one selected at random → mediator is selected
- If they approve M1 → M1 gets 2, M2 gets 1 → M1 wins
- If they approve M2 → M2 gets 2, M1 gets 1 → M2 wins
- If they approve both → both get 2 → both are candidates → selected at random

In all cases, a mediator **is selected** (since at least one has 1, and no one has more than others).

So by approving both M1 and M2, **the mediator is guaranteed to be selected**.

Now, suppose we **approve only M1**.

Then:
- If other player approves only M2 → M1:1, M2:1 → both tied → random selection → mediator is selected
- If other player approves M1 → M1:2, M2:1 → M1 wins
- If other player approves both → M1:2, M2:2 → both tied → random selection → mediator selected
- If other player approves nothing → M1:1, M2:0 → M1 wins

So in **all cases**, a mediator is selected **except** one: if other player approves **only M1**, then M1:2, M2:1 → M1 wins → still selected.

Wait — actually, **in all cases, a mediator is selected** if we approve M1, since M1 will have at least 1 approval.

But if we approve **neither**, then:
- If other approves nothing → no mediator selected → no delegation → original game → both get 4
- If other approves M1 → M1:1 → wins
- If other approves M2 → M2:1 → wins
- If other approves both → both get 1 → both are selected → random winner

So the **only time a mediator is *not* selected** is **if we approve no one and the other player approves no one**.

But if we approve **at least one**, then **mediator is selected**.

Therefore, as long as we approve **at least one** of M1 or M2, the mediator **will be selected**.

But if we approve **both**, we are **safe** — and the mediator is selected regardless of the other player.

If we approve **only one**, and the other player also approves only the other, then **both have 1 approval** → both are tied → mediator is selected.

The only case where **no mediator is selected** is if **no one approves any mediator**.

Therefore, to **maximize the chance** that a mediator is selected, we should **approve at least one**.

But if we approve **nothing**, and the other player also approves nothing, then no mediator is selected → we play the base game → get 4.

But if we approve even one, then a mediator **is selected** (whenever the other player approves something or nothing) — unless the other player approves nothing, but even then, **if we approve one**, that mediator has 1 approval → others have 0 → it wins.

Therefore, **by approving at least one mediator, we guarantee the mediator is selected**, and the **game proceeds with delegation**.

Then, in the delegation stage, as we saw, both players can coordinate on **delegating**, getting (10,10).

Therefore, we would **both get 10**, which is better than 4.

So **we want to ensure mediation happens**.

Now, does it matter **which** mediator we approve?

No — since both behave the same.

But if we **approve both**, we are **safe** — even if the other player approves nothing, a mediator is still selected.

If we approve only one, and the other player approves the other one, then both have 1 → both are candidates → one selected at random → still ok.

But what if the other player approves **nothing**?

If we approve only M1, and they approve nothing → M1 gets 1, M2 gets 0 → M1 wins → mediator is selected.

Same as if we approve both.

So in all cases, **if we approve at least one**, mediator is selected.

Only if we **approve none** do we risk no mediator.

But if we approve none, and the other player approves none → we get 4.

If we approve one, we get at least 10.

So **we should approve at least one**.

But which one?

Since both behave the same, it doesn’t matter.

But is there a **strategic advantage** to approving both?

No — it doesn’t change the outcome.

But perhaps there is a concern about the **other player’s incentives**?

Wait — no: the other player will also analyze this.

But **if both players approve at least one mediator**, then the mediator is selected.

Then, in delegation stage, both have an incentive to delegate → both get 10.

So **if we approve one (e.g., M1), and the other player approves M2**, then both get 1 approval → both are candidates → one selected at random → mediator is selected → then both delegate → both get 10.

Same outcome as if we both approved the same.

So **the outcome is the same in all cases where at least one mediator is selected**.

Therefore, **we should approve at least one**.

But which one?

We can choose either.

But since we are asked to **output a JSON object with all mediators**, and we must decide "M1": true/false, "M2": true/false.

Now, since they are identical, **approving both is safe, and approving one is also safe**.

But is there a reason to **approve only one**?

Suppose we approve only M1.

Then the other player, knowing that M1 is approved, might approve M2, to **still** get the mediator selected, and possibly bias the random selection.

But since both mediators behave the same, **it doesn’t matter**.

Therefore, **no strategic reason to prefer one**.

But wait — **there is no reason to disapprove either**.

In fact, **approving both is no worse than approving one** — and may prevent situations where a mediator is not selected due to slight misalignment.

But actually, as we saw, even if we approve only one, mediation happens.

So **approving both is not necessary**.

But **is there any downside** to approving both?

No — equivalent.

But suppose the other player is **strategic**.

But since both mediators are identical, **there is no benefit to disapproval**.

Therefore, **the best strategy is to approve both**.

Why?

Because:
- It guarantees that no matter what the other player does, a mediator is selected.
- It does not hurt us in any way.
- It gives us the chance to get 10 instead of 4.

Even if we approve only one, we get the same outcome.

But **approving both is risk-free**.

It doesn’t hurt us.

So **why not approve both?**

Unless there is a cost, but there is no cost.

Therefore, we should approve both.

But let’s confirm.

Suppose we approve only M1.

Then, if the other player approves nothing → M1 gets 1 → wins → mediator selected → both can delegate → we get 10.

If other player approves M2 → both get 1 → both eligible → random selection → mediator selected → same thing.

So same outcome.

So no downside.

But if we approve both, same result.

So **it doesn’t matter**.

But **the problem asks**: we must **approve** mediators.

And we want to **maximize our expected points**.

Since both options give the **same expected outcome**, we are indifferent.

But to **maximize the chance** of the mediator being selected (which is already 1 if we approve at least one), and since approving both still gives same outcome, **we might as well approve both**.

Moreover, **if we approve both, we have no fear** even if the other player approves nothing or approves the other.

But is there a possibility that **approving both** could **hurt** us?

Suppose the other player **thinks** that if we approve both, they might be more likely to **not delegate**, **if they expect us to be free-riding**?

But no — the mediator behavior depends only on **how many delegate**, not who.

And the outcome is symmetric.

In the delegation stage, both players still want to delegate if the other does — because they get 10.

So **no reason for the other player to not delegate**.

Therefore, **no collusion or coordination failure**.

Thus, both players will delegate if mediator is selected.

Therefore, **the only risk is that no mediator is selected**.

We can **eliminate that risk** by approving at least one.

But to be safe, and since there is **no downside**, we should approve both.

Moreover, in case the other player has different intentions — but since we don’t know, better to be safe.

But even if we only approve one, the risk is gone.

So **both strategies are equally good**.

But the question is: **which ones should we approve?**

Since there is no **difference**, we can approve both.

But let's consider: **what if we approve only one, and the other player approves only the same one?**

Then that mediator wins → mediator selected → both delegate → both get 10.

Same as if we approved both.

So no difference.

Therefore, **we can approve both, and it doesn’t hurt us**.

Thus, to **maximize the chance of success**, and since it’s costless, we should approve both.

But note: **if we approve both, we are more likely to be happy**, even if the other player approves nothing — still selected.

But if we approve only one, and the other player approves nothing, still selected.

So same.

But here’s a **subtlety**:

What if the other player is **trying to prevent** us from getting 10?

But no — both players want to maximize their own points.

If a mediator is selected, and we both delegate, we get 10 — better for both.

So the other player **wants** the mediator to be selected.

Therefore, they will **approve at least one**, unless they are irrational.

So **we can assume the other player will approve at least one**, for their own benefit.

Therefore, **if we approve at least one, mediator is selected**.

Thus, **we should approve at least one**.

But again, since both are identical, and no cost, **we should approve both**.

Final decision:

We approve both M1 and M2.

This ensures the mediator is selected regardless of the other player’s actions, and gives us the opportunity to get 10 points.

There is **no downside**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.


Instruction:
- Choose a probability distribution over the provided actions each round.
- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

Format requirement:
Return exactly one JSON object, for example:
{"A0": <INT>, "A1": <INT>, ...}

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

This is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 is row, Player 2 is column):

|                | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**     | 10,10  | 0,20   |
| **P1: A1**     | 6,2    | 4,4    |

We are Player 1.

Let’s first analyze the **Nash equilibrium** of this base game, as it gives us a benchmark.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that Player 1 plays A0
- $ q $ = probability that Player 2 plays A0

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If P1 plays A0: $ 10q + 0(1 - q) = 10q $
- If P1 plays A1: $ 6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

For Player 1 to be indifferent (necessary for mixed strategy equilibrium), set:
$$
10q = 2q + 4 \Rightarrow 8q = 4 \Rightarrow q = 0.5
$$

So Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.5.

Now for Player 2’s indifference:
- If P2 plays A0: $ 10p + 2(1 - p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $
- If P2 plays A1: $ 20p + 4(1 - p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4 $

Set equal:
$$
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 \Rightarrow -8p = 2 \Rightarrow p = -0.25
$$

That’s **not possible** — probability can’t be negative.

So **no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in which both players mix**.

Hence, we look for pure strategy equilibria.

Check pure strategy Nash equilibria:

1. (A0, A0):  
   - P1 gets 10; if deviates to A1, gets 6 → no incentive  
   - P2 gets 10; if deviates to A1, gets 20 → yes, better to deviate  
   → Not NE

2. (A0, A1):  
   - P1 gets 0; if deviates to A1, gets 4 → better → not NE

3. (A1, A0):  
   - P1 gets 6; if deviates to A0, gets 10 → better → not NE

4. (A1, A1):  
   - P1 gets 4; deviating to A0 → gets 0 → worse  
   - P2 gets 4; deviating to A0 → gets 2 → worse  
   → **This is a Nash equilibrium!**

So **(A1, A1)** is the only pure Nash equilibrium.

But is it stable? Yes — no incentive to deviate.

However, note that in (A0,A0), both get 10 — better than (4,4). But it's unstable because either player wants to defect.

So in standard game theory, players might end up at (A1, A1), but we have a twist.

---

### **Step 2: Introduce the Mediator Delegation Option**

Now, you (Player 1) can choose a new action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

The mediator behaves as follows:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0

Note: You are Player 1. The other player is Player 2.

You can choose:
- A0: play A0 yourself
- A1: play A1 yourself
- A2: delegate to mediator

Similarly, Player 2 can also choose A0, A1, or A2.

But **you don't know what Player 2 will do** — you have to choose a strategy that maximizes your expected payoff, assuming Player 2 will play optimally (or worst-case, or in equilibrium).

But note: **Player 2 proposed and selected the mediator**, so they are aligned with the mediator’s rules. So Player 2 might be more likely to **delegate**, or at least might act strategically based on the new game.

So now, we are in a **3-action game** (A0, A1, A2), and the outcome depends on **both players’ choices**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze possible combinations of actions (by you and Player 2)**

We need to compute expected payoff for you (Player 1) in each combination.

Let’s define:
- Your action: A0, A1, A2
- Player 2’s action: A0, A1, A2
- Then, depending on number of delegations, mediator plays A0 or A1.

Let’s go through all 9 cases.

---

#### **Case 1: You choose A0, Player 2 chooses A0**
- No delegation (0 players delegated)
- **Mediator is not involved**
- You play A0, Player 2 plays A0 → Payoff: (10,10)

→ You get **10**

---

#### **Case 2: You choose A0, Player 2 chooses A1**
- No delegation
- You: A0, P2: A1 → (0,20)

→ You get **0**

---

#### **Case 3: You choose A0, Player 2 chooses A2 (Delegate)**
- One player delegated (P2 only) → Mediator plays **A1**
- So **you play A0**, **mediator plays A1** → You are the one playing A0, and other player’s action is A1

→ So outcome: (A0, A1) → you get **0**

---

#### **Case 4: You choose A1, Player 2 chooses A0**
- No delegation
- You: A1, P2: A0 → (6,2)

→ You get **6**

---

#### **Case 5: You choose A1, Player 2 chooses A1**
- No delegation
- You: A1, P2: A1 → (4,4)

→ You get **4**

---

#### **Case 6: You choose A1, Player 2 chooses A2**
- One player delegated (P2 only) → Mediator plays **A1**
- You play A1, mediator plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get **4**

→ You get **4**

---

#### **Case 7: You choose A2 (Delegate), Player 2 chooses A0**
- One player delegated (you only) → Mediator plays **A1**
- You are delegating → you play A1 (mediator’s choice)
- P2 plays A0

→ So outcome: (A1, A0) → you get **6**

→ You get **6**

---

#### **Case 8: You choose A2, Player 2 chooses A1**
- One player delegated (you only) → Mediator plays **A1**
- You: A1 (via mediator), P2: A1 → (A1, A1) → you get **4**

→ You get **4**

---

#### **Case 9: You choose A2, Player 2 chooses A2 (Both delegate)**
- Two players delegated → Mediator plays **A0**
- So you play A0 (via mediator), P2 plays A0 (via mediator)
- Outcome: (A0, A0) → you get **10**

→ You get **10**

---

Let’s summarize the payoff to **you (Player 1)** for each combination:

| Your | P2 | Delegations | Mediator play | Your action | P2 action | Your payoff |
|------|----|--------------|----------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| A0   | A0 | 0            | N/A            | A0           | A0         | 10          |
| A0   | A1 | 0            | N/A            | A0           | A1         | 0           |
| A0   | A2 | 1            | A1             | A0           | A1         | 0           |
| A1   | A0 | 0            | N/A            | A1           | A0         | 6           |
| A1   | A1 | 0            | N/A            | A1           | A1         | 4           |
| A1   | A2 | 1            | A1             | A1           | A1         | 4           |
| A2   | A0 | 1            | A1             | A1           | A0         | 6           |
| A2   | A1 | 1            | A1             | A1           | A1         | 4           |
| A2   | A2 | 2            | A0             | A0           | A0         | 10          |

---

### **Step 4: Model as a 3x3 Game and Find Optimal Strategy**

We now have a 3x3 game. Let:
- $ x $ = prob you play A0
- $ y $ = prob you play A1
- $ z = 1 - x - y $ = prob you play A2

Similarly, assume Player 2 chooses a mixed strategy with:
- $ a $ = prob P2 plays A0
- $ b $ = prob P2 plays A1
- $ c = 1 - a - b $ = prob P2 plays A2

But since we want to **maximize your minimum expected payoff**, and Player 2 is also rational (and likely trying to minimize your payoff or maximize theirs), we can solve for the **maximin strategy** — the strategy that maximizes your **worst-case expected payoff**, assuming P2 plays optimally to minimize your payoff.

Alternatively, we can look for a **Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies**.

But since this is complex, let’s analyze **candidate strategies** from a strategic perspective.

---

### **Step 5: Strategic Considerations**

Let’s see who benefits from delegation.

**Key observations:**

- If **only one person delegates**, mediator plays **A1**
- If **both delegate**, mediator plays **A0**

So:
- If you delegate alone (P2 doesn’t), you get A1 (mediator), P2 plays whatever they play
- If you both delegate, you both get A0

Now, suppose **Player 2 is rational**. They chose the mediator and know these rules.

So P2 will consider: **Should they delegate? What's their best response?**

But since we want to **maximize your payoff**, and Player 2 is trying to **maximize their own**, we may assume they will respond optimally.

But we can try to **reason about what P2 is likely to do**, especially if we assume both players act rationally.

Let’s ask: **What would Player 2 do if you choose a certain action?**

Suppose you play A2 (delegate). Then:
- If P2 plays A0: you get 6 (A1 vs A0)
- If P2 plays A1: you get 4 (A1 vs A1)
- If P2 plays A2: you get 10 (A0 vs A0)

So P2 gets:
- A0: you play A1, P2 plays A0 → P2 gets 2
- A1: both play A1 → P2 gets 4
- A2: both play A0 → P2 gets 10

So P2's best response to you delegating is to **also delegate (A2)** — because that gives them 10, best of all.

If you delegate, P2 gets:
- A0 → 2
- A1 → 4
- A2 → 10

So P2 will **best respond by delegating**.

Hence, if you delegate, P2 will also delegate → outcome: (A0,A0) → you get **10**, P2 gets 10.

But wait — is 10 the best for P2? Yes.

But is it rational for P2 to delegate? Yes — getting 10 is better than 4 or 2.

Now, suppose **you do not delegate**.

Then P2 will choose A0, A1, or A2 (delegation).

But now P2 can also delegate.

Let’s suppose P2’s options:
- If P2 does **not** delegate (A0 or A1), they play that action directly.
- If P2 **delegates**, then:
  - If you don’t delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → P2 plays A1
  - If you delegate → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → P2 plays A0

So let’s suppose **you play A0**.

Then P2’s options:
- Play A0: you get 10, P2 gets 10
- Play A1: you get 0, P2 gets 20 → **P2 gets 20** — very good
- Delegate: since you didn't, only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → P2 plays A1 → same as playing A1 directly → P2 gets 20

So P2 will prefer to play A1 or delegate → both give 20.

So if you play A0, P2 will play A1 (or delegate) → you get **0**

Similarly, if you play A1:
- P2 plays A0: you get 6, P2 gets 2
- P2 plays A1: you get 4, P2 gets 4
- P2 delegates: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → P2 plays A1 → same as playing A1 → gets 4

So best for P2: either A1 or delegate → gets 4

But A0 gives them only 2 → not good.

So P2 will **not play A0**, but will play A1 or delegate → you get **4**

So if you play A1, you get **4**

Now suppose you **delegate** (A2):
- As above, P2 will best respond by also delegating → (A0,A0) → you get **10**

So your payoff depends on your action:
- A0 → P2 plays A1 → you get 0
- A1 → P2 plays A1 → you get 4
- A2 → P2 plays A2 → you get 10

So **delegation gives 10**, which is best.

But is this sustainable?

Wait — but if **you** always delegate, P2 will always delegate → both get 10.

But is there any incentive for P2 to deviate?

Suppose **you delegate**, so P2 knows that if they **don’t** delegate, they get:
- A0: you play A1, they play A0 → P2 gets 2
- A1: you play A1, they play A1 → P2 gets 4
- Or delegate: you both delegate → P2 gets 10

So P2 **will** delegate — they gain 10 vs 4.

So equilibrium: both delegate → (A0,A0) → payoff (10,10)

Now, can you **deviate** from this?

Suppose you **instead** play A1.

Then P2:
- A0: you A1, P2 A0 → P2 gets 2
- A1: both A1 → P2 gets 4
- Delegate: only one delegate → P2 plays A1 → same as A1 → gets 4

So best is to play A1 or delegate → get 4

So P2 will play A1 or delegate → you get 4

But if you play A0: you get 0

So **best choice is to delegate**, getting 10.

Now, if P2 thinks you will delegate, they will best respond by delegating → you get 10.

So in that equilibrium, **you get 10**.

But is this **stable**?

Suppose you play A2 (delegate), P2 plays A2 (delegate) → both get 10.

Now, what if **P2 considers deviating**?

- If P2 plays A0 instead: you delegated (A1), P2 plays A0 → outcome (A1,A0) → P2 gets 2 → worse than 10 → no
- If P2 plays A1 → (A1,A1) → P2 gets 4 → worse than 10 → no
→ So P2 has **no incentive to deviate**

Similarly, if **you** consider deviating:
- If you play A0: P2 will play A1 → you get 0 → worse than 10
- If you play A1: P2 will play A1 → you get 4 → worse
→ So you have **no incentive to deviate**

✅ So **(A2, A2)** — both delegate — is a **Nash equilibrium** with payoff (10,10)

Now, are there others?

Try: both play A1 → (A1,A1) → you get 4

But if you deviate to A2: then only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, P2 plays A1 → same → you get 4

But if you delegate, P2 may respond: if you delegate, P2 can either play A0 → gets 2, A1 → gets 4, or delegate → gets 10

So P2 will delegate → then you get 10 (from (A0,A0)) → **better**!

So if you deviate to A2, and P2 responds by delegating, you get 10.

So **you can gain by deviating** from (A1,A1) to A2 → so (A1,A1) is **not** a Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, (A0,A0): you play A0, P2 plays A0 → you get 10

But if you deviate to A2: then only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, P2 plays A0 → you get 6 → worse than 10 → so you may not want to.

But P2: if you deviate to A2, P2 can play A0 → you get 6, P2 gets 2 → but P2 can instead delegate → (A0,A0) → P2 gets 10 → better.

So P2 **would** delegate → so you get 10

So if you deviate from A0 to A2, and P2 delegates, you still get 10.

But P2 may not want to delegate — if P2 plays A0, they get 2, which is worse than 10.

So P2 will delegate → you get 10.

So deviation to A2 gives you 10 — same as before.

So you’re indifferent.

But P2: in (A0,A0), P2 gets 10.

If you deviate to A2, then P2 gets:
- A0: 2
- A1: 4
- A2: 10 → best

So P2 will still delegate → gets 10.

So (A0,A0) is not an equilibrium — because if you deviate to A2, P2 still plays A2 → you still get 10.

But you might as well play A0 or A2.

Wait — but if you play A2, and P2 plays A2, you get 10.

But if you play A0 and P2 plays A0, you also get 10.

But in (A0,A0), you get 10, but P2 gets 10.

Can P2 deviate? If P2 plays A2 instead (while you play A0), and P2 delegates, then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so outcome: (A0, A1) → P2 gets 20 → **much better!**

Ah! That’s critical.

So suppose:
- You play A0 (P1)
- P2 plays A0 (P2) → (A0,A0) → P2 gets 10

But if P2 **deviates** to **A2 (delegate)**, and you are playing A0 (not delegating), then **only one delegate (P2)** → mediator plays A1 → so P2 plays A1

So outcome: (A0, A1) → P2 gets **20**!

So P2 gets **20**, which is better than 10 → so P2 will deviate.

Therefore, (A0,A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium — P2 has incentive to deviate.

Similarly, in (A1,A1): P2 gets 4. If they delegate, then only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → P2 plays A1 → same as before → gets 4 → no gain. So no incentive to deviate.

But earlier: if you are playing A1, P2 can play A1, get 4, or delegate, get same 4.

But if you play A0, P2 can get 20 by delegating.

So (A1,A1) is potentially stable, but we already saw that you are better off deviating to A2.

But suppose you are playing A1, P2 is playing A1.

You consider A2 (delegate):
- You delegate → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1
- P2 plays A1 → outcome: (A1,A1) → you get 4
- So same as before

But P2: if you delegate, and P2 plays A1, P2 gets 4 — same.

But if P2 **delegates** instead? Then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → P2 plays A0

So outcome: (A1,A0) → P2 gets 2 — worse than 4

So P2 would **not** delegate.

So if you delegate, P2’s best is to play A1 → you get 4.

So no gain.

But earlier: if you **delegate**, and P2 **does not** delegate, then P2's best response is to play A1 (gets 4) or delegate (gets 4) — same.

But if P2 plays A1, you get 4 — same as before.

So deviating to A2 gives you **same** payoff — 4.

But you might as well play A1.

So (A1,A1) is an equilibrium only if you are playing A1 and P2 plays A1.

But when you consider **A2**, you get same payoff, so you're indifferent.

But P2: if you are playing A1, P2 has no incentive to deviate — playing A1 or A2 gives them 4.

But if they play A0, they get 2 — worse.

So yes, (A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium with payoff (4,4).

But you can do better.

Back to **(A2,A2)**: both delegate → (A0,A0) → you get 10.

As we saw:
- P2 gets 10
- If P2 deviates to A0: you play A1 (via mediator), P2 plays A0 → P2 gets 2 → worse
- If P2 deviates to A1: you play A1, P2 plays A1 → P2 gets 4 → worse
→ So no incentive to deviate → **P2 has no incentive**
- You: if you deviate to A0: then you play A0, P2 plays A0 → you get 10 → same
  But P2: if you play A0, and P2 plays A2, then only one delegate → P2 plays A1 → so outcome: (A0,A1) → P2 gets 20 — **much better** for P2

But if **you** deviate to A0, then P2 will not cooperate — P2 will **deviate** to A1 or A2 to get 20

So if **you** play A0, P2 gets 20 → so P2 will **not** play A2 unless you do

But in the equilibrium (A2,A2), if **you** deviate to A0, then **P2 will respond by playing A1 (or delegating)** → you get **0** (from A0 vs A1)

So your payoff drops from 10 to 0 → big loss.

So you **should not deviate**.

Similarly, P2 has no incentive to deviate.

Therefore, **(A2, A2)** is a **strict Nash equilibrium** — both players are better off staying.

So the **optimal strategy for you** is to **delegate** with probability 1.

But wait — is that the only equilibrium?

What if you randomize?

Suppose you randomize between A0, A1, A2.

But from above, the only **stable** equilibrium where you get 10 is **(A2,A2)**.

And in that case, you get 10 — highest possible.

Other equilibria give you only 4 or less.

Even if you play mixed strategy, but P2 plays optimally, you won’t get more than 10.

Can you get more than 10? No — maximum is 10.

So **10 is optimal**.

And you can achieve 10 by **always delegating**, assuming P2 will also delegate (which is optimal for them).

Therefore, the **optimal strategy** is to **always delegate**.

Thus, the probability distribution:

- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

### ✅ Final Answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P2
response:
Let's go step by step to analyze this decision-making game and determine which mediators to approve.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game and Your Role**

You are **Player 2** in a two-player simultaneous-move game.

Actions: A0, A1  
Payoff matrix (you are Player 2, other player is Player 1):

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|------------------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (You)**                 | 10, 10 | 2, 6   |
| **A1 (You)**                 | 20, 0  | 4, 4   |

So your payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

This game is *not* symmetric in payoffs — you benefit most when you play A1 and opponent plays A0 (20 points), and least when you play A0 and opponent plays A1 (2 points).

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Option**

You can choose to **delegate** your move to a mediator. The mediator will play based on how many people have delegated to it.

You can also choose to act independently.

But first, there's an **approval voting process** to choose which mediator will be used — **only one mediator will be selected**.

- The winning mediator is the one with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- If multiple mediators tie for the most approvals, one is picked **uniformly at random**.
- You decide which mediators to approve (i.e., support).

There are **two mediators**, both proposed by different players:

- **M1 (proposed by Player 1)**  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

- **M2 (proposed by Player 2)**  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **M1 and M2 are identical in behavior.**

So, both mediators have the same rules. Therefore, **they are functionally indistinguishable**.

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate the Implications of Approval**

Since **M1 and M2 behave identically**, the only difference between them is **who proposed them**.

But your goal is to **maximize your total expected points** across all possibilities.

You don’t care who proposed them — only which ones lead to better outcomes.

But since M1 and M2 are **identical**, the outcome of the game depends **only on whether a mediator is selected**, not which one.

So, the **only strategic difference** is in **how your approval affects the chance** that *some* mediator (M1 or M2) is selected.

Let’s examine the **approval voting process**:

- You and the other player vote (you can approve or disapprove each).
- Each mediator gets a number of approvals.
- The mediator(s) with the **maximum approvals** are the candidates.
- One of them is selected **uniformly at random** from the set with the max approvals.

So, your approval of a mediator increases the chance it is selected.

But **both M1 and M2 have same behavior**, so regardless of which one is selected, the outcome is the same.

Thus, **for your expected payoff, M1 and M2 are equivalent.**

---

### **Step 4: What Happens If a Mediator Is Selected?**

Let’s suppose a mediator is selected (say, M1 or M2). Then:

- The mediator plays:
  - **A1** if **only one** player delegates
  - **A0** if **both** players delegate

So the outcome depends on **how many players delegate**.

Let’s evaluate the four possible delegation scenarios:

---

#### **Scenario 1: Neither Player Delegates**

Then both players play independently.

You choose a strategy (prob of A0 or A1), opponent chooses theirs.

But now, **if no one delegates**, the mediator is **not used**.

So the game reduces to the original game.

But **you don’t know what the opponent will do**, and you don’t know how they will approve.

So we need to consider the full strategic picture.

But the key is: your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff** given the approval process and the eventual game.

However, since the mediators are identical, and selection depends only on approval count, we must ask:

**Does it matter which mediators you approve, as long as at least one is approved?**

Let’s look at possible outcomes depending on approvals.

But here’s the catch: **you don’t control the other player’s actions**, but you can influence the mediator selection.

So the question is: **Who is more likely to benefit from having a certain mediator chosen?**

But since M1 and M2 are identical, **you are indifferent between them from a payoff perspective**.

Therefore:

- Approving a mediator increases its chance of being selected.
- Since they are identical, you want **to maximize the chance that a mediator is selected**, because it gives you a potentially better strategy (delegation) than acting independently.

But **you can approve both**, and the system selects a winner at random from those with maximum approvals.

Suppose:

- You approve both M1 and M2
- Opponent approves neither

Then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 1 approval
- Max approvals = 1
- Winner: both are tied → random selection → each has 50% chance.

→ Mediator is selected with 100% probability.

- You approve neither
- Opponent approves both

Then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 1 approval
- Same outcome.

- You approve M1 only, opponent approves M2 only → still both have 1 approval → both are in the running → 50% chance of being selected.

- You approve both, opponent approves only M1

Then:
- M1: 2 approvals
- M2: 1 approval
- Max = 2 → M1 is selected with 100%

So, **to maximize the probability that some mediator is selected**, you should **approve both**, unless there is a reason to prefer one.

But **since they are identical**, it’s better to **maximize the chance that a mediator is used**.

If you approve **both**, then **even if opponent disapproves both**, then both have 1 approval → tie → mediator is selected (randomly).

If you approve only one, and opponent approves the other, it’s still a tie → mediator selected.

But if you approve only one, and opponent approves none → then only one mediator has 1 approval → that one is selected.

Still, mediator is selected.

However, if you approve **only one**, and opponent approves **nothing**, then only one mediator has 1 approval → it is selected → you get the mediator.

But if you approve **both**, and opponent approves 0, then both have 1 approval → tied → random selection → 50% chance.

So in that case, **you risk 50% chance of not getting a mediator**.

Wait — **is that worse?**

No — because **you still get a mediator 100% of the time**, even in a tie.

The winner is selected **from those with maximum approvals**, so if both have 1, both are eligible → one is chosen at random.

So **you are guaranteed to get a mediator in every outcome where at least one approval is cast.**

But what if **everyone approves nothing**?

Then **no mediator is selected** → you must play un-delegated.

So to **maximize the chance that a mediator is used**, you should **approve at least one**, preferably both, to avoid situations where no mediator gets approval.

But let’s compare:

#### Case 1: You approve **both M1 and M2**

- If opponent approves **neither** → M1:1, M2:1 → max=1 → winner chosen at random → mediator is used → **you get mediation with 100% certainty**
- If opponent approves **one** → say M1 → M1:2, M2:1 → M1 gets selected → you get mediation
- If opponent approves **both** → both have 2 approvals → tied → random selection → mediation used

→ In **all cases**, **a mediator is used**.

Thus, **if you approve both**, then **no matter what the opponent does**, **a mediator will be used**.

#### Case 2: You approve **only M1**

- Opponent approves **neither** → M1:1 → M1 selected → mediation used
- Opponent approves **only M2** → M1:1, M2:1 → tie → random → mediation used
- Opponent approves **only M1** → M1:2, M2:1 → M1 selected → mediation used
- Opponent approves **both** → M1:2, M2:2 → tie → random → mediation used

→ **Still, mediation is used in all cases**

So **even with only one approval**, a mediator is **always used**, as long as **at least one person approves**.

But what if **you approve only M1**, and **opponent approves only M2**? Both have 1 → tie → random → mediator used.

So **no matter what**, mediation is used.

But here’s a crucial point: **you have no control over the opponent’s approval.**

But your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff**, **regardless of opponent behavior** — so you must consider worst-case or best-case?

No — in decision theory, you usually consider **expected utility** over all possibilities.

But since you don't know opponent’s strategy, you should **act to maximize your worst-case expected payoff** (robustness), or **maximize expected payoff under common assumptions**?

But there’s no prior — so we can assume the opponent is rational and self-interested.

But **in this stage**, you’re only deciding **which mediators to approve**, and the goal is to **maximize your total expected points in the final game**.

But **you cannot affect the outcome of the final game unless you can influence the delegation strategy**.

So let’s consider:

**If a mediator is used**, then your move is determined by the **number of delegations** and the **mediator's rule**.

But **you can choose whether to delegate**.

Ah — this is key!

You can choose to **delegate** or **act independently**.

But **the delegation decision** may depend on whether a mediator is in place.

So let’s clarify:

After the approval voting, the mediator is selected (if any).

Then, **you and the opponent decide** whether to delegate or not.

But **you don’t know in advance whether the selected mediator is M1 or M2** — but they are identical — so irrelevant.

So, **after the approval voting**, the game proceeds as:

- You choose: delegate or not
- Opponent chooses: delegate or not
- Based on the number of delegations, the mediator plays:
  - 1 delegation: A1
  - 2 delegations: A0

So if you **delegate**, the mediator **plays A1 if you are the only one**, or **A0 if both delegate**.

So if **you delegate**, and opponent delegates → both delegating → mediator plays A0 → you get A0

If **you delegate**, opponent does not → only you → mediator plays A1 → you get A1

Similarly, if **you do not delegate**, and opponent delegates → only opponent → mediator plays A1 → opponent gets A1 → which affects payoff

So now we can model the strategic choices **after** the mediator is selected.

But **you** get to **choose** your action (delegate or not), and the opponent chooses theirs (delegate or not), simultaneously.

And you want to maximize your **expected payoff**.

But since the mediator rules are deterministic, and your choice affects the outcome, we can analyze the **optimal delegation strategy** **given** that a mediator is used.

Let’s suppose the mediator **is used** (i.e., at least one approval was cast).

Now, you and opponent each decide whether to delegate.

Let’s define:

- Strategy: You choose to delegate (D) or not (ND)
- Opponent chooses D or ND

Outcomes:

| You | Opponent | Delegations | Mediator plays | You get | Opponent gets |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| D   | D        | 2           | A0             | 10      | ? |
| D   | ND       | 1           | A1             | 20      | 0 |
| ND  | D        | 1           | A1             | 2       | 6 |
| ND  | ND       | 0           | ?              | ???     | ??? |

Wait — **if no one delegates**, then **no mediator is used** → you play independently, as per original game.

So we must consider two cases:

1. **Mediator is used** → then delegation choices determine the action.
2. **Mediator is not used** → you and opponent play independently.

So your decision to delegate depends on whether a mediator is in use.

But **you commit to approval decisions before knowing anything about the opponent's choices**, so you don’t know if a mediator will be used.

But you can design a strategy: **approve mediators to increase the chance that a mediator is used**, and then **choose your delegation action optimally**.

But **if a mediator is not used**, then you must play independently, and the outcome depends on your mix of A0 and A1.

So to compare, let’s compare two **scenarios**:

### **Scenario A: Mediator is used**

Then your choice: delegate or not.

Let’s assume the opponent is also rational and self-interested.

Let’s analyze the game when mediator is in use:

Payoffs when mediator is used:

| You | Opponent | Delegations | Mediator plays | You get | Opponent gets |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| D   | D        | 2           | A0             | 10      | 10            |
| D   | ND       | 1           | A1             | 20      | 0             |
| ND  | D        | 1           | A1             | 2       | 6             |
| ND  | ND       | 0           | —              | —       | —             |

But **"ND, ND"** → no one delegates → mediator not used → so not in this scenario.

So for **mediator in use**, the possible games are only the first three.

Now, **you want to maximize your payoff**, and **opponent wants to maximize their payoff**.

Let’s analyze the **best response**.

Let’s suppose you know the opponent's strategy. We want to find a Nash equilibrium.

But we can analyze best responses.

Suppose **opponent always delegates**:

- If you delegate → you get 10
- If you don’t delegate → opponent delegates, so one delegation → mediator plays A1 → you get 2

→ So you prefer to delegate (10 > 2)

So best response: **delegate**

Suppose **opponent never delegates**:

- If you delegate → only you → mediator plays A1 → you get 20
- If you don’t delegate → no one delegates → mediator not used → you play independently.

But **in this subcase**, if no one delegates, **mediator not used** → so you play the original game.

In the original game, you don’t know opponent’s strategy.

But now we are in the case: opponent **does not delegate**, and **you are deciding**.

But if **you don't delegate**, and opponent doesn't delegate → no mediator → original game.

So, to decide whether to delegate or not, you need to compare:

- **Delegate** → you get **20** (because only you delegate → mediator plays A1)
- **Not delegate** → then no one delegates → you play independently → your payoff depends on your strategy and theirs.

But they are playing **independently**, so their strategy is fixed.

We don’t know what their strategy is.

But if we assume the opponent is rational and wants to maximize their payoff, and they are in the same situation.

But here’s the key: **the opponent will also have to decide whether to delegate**.

So let’s look for a **Nash equilibrium** in the delegation game under mediator use.

The game matrix (you vs. opponent, both want to maximize own payoff):

|          | Opponent: D | Opponent: ND |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| You: D   | 10, 10      | 20, 0        |
| You: ND  | 2, 6        | ???          |

But **ND, ND** → mediator not used → so payoffs go back to original game.

So we must define **what happens if both don’t delegate**.

In that case, **you and opponent choose actions independently**, and get payoffs from the original game.

But to calculate payoff, we need **mixed strategies**.

But now we’re in an infinite regress.

But we can assume that **if no one delegates**, the game defaults to the **original symmetric game**, and both players will choose a strategy.

But to make progress, let’s **suppose** that if no delegation occurs, both players play **some mixed strategy**, and we can compute expected payoffs.

But this is complex.

Instead, try to find **stable strategies**.

Let’s suppose both players **do not delegate** → then the game is original.

In that case, what is the Nash equilibrium?

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium of the original game.

You are Player 2. Let p = prob you play A0.  
Let q = prob opponent plays A0.

Your expected payoff:

- Play A0: 10q + 2(1−q) = 10q + 2 − 2q = 8q + 2  
- Play A1: 20q + 4(1−q) = 20q + 4 − 4q = 16q + 4

Set equal for indifference:

8q + 2 = 16q + 4  
2 − 4 = 16q − 8q  
−2 = 8q  
q = −1/4 → not possible.

Wait — that’s a problem.

This suggests that **Player 2 always prefers A1 regardless of opponent's move**, because:

If opponent plays A0 (q=1):  
- You: A0 → 10, A1 → 20 → prefer A1

If opponent plays A1 (q=0):  
- You: A0 → 2, A1 → 4 → still prefer A1

So **A1 dominates A0 for Player 2**.

Therefore, **in the original game**, Player 2 will **always play A1**.

Then opponent, knowing this, will play **A0** (because if they play A0, they get 0; if they play A1, they get 4) — so opponent prefers A0.

Wait — opponent is Player 1.

If you (P2) always play A1:

- Opponent plays A0 → gets 0
- Opponent plays A1 → gets 4 → so they prefer A1

So opponent will play A1.

Then you play A1 → both A1 → payoffs: 4,4

So NE: both play A1 → payoff 4 for you.

But if opponent plays A1, you play A1 → gets 4

If you played A0, you’d get 2 → worse.

So yes, only NE is both play A1.

But actually, let’s find it properly.

For Player 2:  
Best response to q (prob opponent plays A0):
- A1 gives 20q + 4(1−q) = 16q + 4
- A0 gives 10q + 2(1−q) = 8q + 2

Compare: 16q + 4 > 8q + 2 → 8q > −2 → always true.

So **A1 is always better**, so Player 2 plays A1 with probability 1.

Then Player 1, knowing you play A1, best responds:
- Play A0 → gets 0
- Play A1 → gets 4

So Player 1 plays A1.

Thus, **unique Nash equilibrium of original game**: both play A1 → payoff (4,4) for (you, opponent)

So **if no delegation occurs**, you get 4.

Now back to **mediator used scenario**.

You and opponent decide to delegate or not.

If **both do not delegate**, you get 4.

Now let’s write the full game matrix when mediator is used:

| You \ Opp | D (delegate) | ND (not delegate) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| D         | 10, 10       | 20, 0             |
| ND        | 2, 6         | 4, 4              |

Now, who will play what?

Let’s find NE.

Check best responses.

Suppose opponent plays **D** (delegate):
- If you play D → 10
- If you play ND → 2
→ You prefer D (10 > 2)

Suppose opponent plays **ND**:
- If you play D → 20
- If you play ND → 4
→ You prefer D (20 > 4)

So **D is strictly dominant for you**.

Similarly, for opponent:

If you play D:
- Opponent: D → 10
- ND → 0 → prefers D

If you play ND:
- Opponent: D → 6
- ND → 4 → prefers D

So D is also strictly dominant for opponent.

Thus, **both play D** → outcome: both delegate → 2 delegations → mediator plays A0 → you get 10.

So **if mediator is used**, **both players delegate**, and **you get 10**

Now, contrast this with **no mediator used**:
- You get 4 (from original NE)

So **if a mediator is used**, you get **10**
- If not, you get **4**

Therefore, **you strongly prefer** that a mediator is used.

Moreover, **no matter what**, if a mediator is used, you get 10.

And you get only 4 if no mediator is used.

So **you always want a mediator to be selected**.

Therefore, your goal in the approval phase is to **maximize the probability that a mediator is selected**.

Now, when is a mediator **not** selected?

Only if **no mediator receives any approvals**.

So **you want at least one approval for a mediator, and preferably to make it impossible for no mediator to be approved**.

But if you approve **nothing**, and opponent approves **nothing**, then no mediator is selected → you get 4.

But if you approve **at least one**, then **at least one mediator has 1 approval** → so mediator is selected (since max approvals ≥1, and there is at least one).

Thus, to prevent the bad outcome (no mediator), you must approve **at least one** mediator.

But you can do better: **approve both**.

If you approve both, then **no matter what opponent does**, **at least one mediator will be approved**, so **mediator will be selected**.

Even if opponent approves nothing, you approved both → both have 1 approval → max =1 → winner chosen at random → mediator is used.

If opponent approves both, still both have 2 → tie → random → mediator used.

So **you get a mediator with certainty** if you approve both.

Now, if you approve **only one**, say M1, and opponent approves **M2 only**, then both have 1 approval → tie → mediator used.

But if you approve only M1, and opponent approves **nothing**, then only M1 has 1 approval → M1 is selected → mediator used.

So **even with only one approval**, you are **guaranteed** a mediator is used.

But suppose you approve M1, opponent approves M2 → both have 1 → tied → random selection → you get 50% chance of M1, 50% M2 → but both are identical → doesn't matter.

So **you still get the mediator**.

So **as long as you approve at least one**, **a mediator will be used**, regardless of opponent.

But if you approve **nothing**, and opponent approves **nothing**, then no mediator → you get 4.

So **you should approve at least one**.

But since both are identical, **there is no cost to approving both**.

And **it doesn’t hurt** — the outcome is the same.

So **best to approve both**, to ensure **maximum safety**.

Even if you approve only one, you are safe only if opponent approves nothing — but if opponent approves someone else, it’s still safe.

In no case is approving one worse than approving both.

But approving both gives **the same outcome** (mediator always used), and **you are not worse off**.

Moreover, if you approve only one, say M1, and opponent approves M2 only, then **M1 and M2 both have 1 approval**, tied, so random selection → you get mediator.

Same as if you approve both — tied → random selection.

So **no difference**.

But if you approve **only M1**, and opponent approves **M1**, then M1 has 2 approvals → selected → you get M1.

If you approve both, and opponent approves M1, then M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 selected.

Same.

But here's a difference: if you approve **only M1**, and opponent approves **M2**, then **both have 1** → tied → random → 50% chance you get M1.

But if you approve **both**, and opponent approves **M2**, then M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 selected → you get M1 for sure.

So, **if you approve only one**, there is a chance (50%) that the other mediator is selected — but since they are identical, it doesn't matter.

So **no difference in payoff**.

But **you might prefer to ensure your preferred mediator is selected**, but since they are identical, you don't.

So **nothing to lose** by approving both.

Therefore, **best strategy: approve both mediators**.

This ensures:

- No matter what opponent does, a mediator is selected → you get 10
- No risk of getting only 4

Thus, **maximizes your probability of getting 10 points**.

And since 10 > 4, this is optimal.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's go step by step to decide which mediators to approve, based on maximizing **your total points** as **Player 1** in this decision-making game.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

The game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1. You are Player 1.

Payoff matrix (you as row player, other as column player):

| Your Action ↓ \ Other’s Action → | A0 (Other) | A1 (Other) |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0 (You)**                  | (10, 10)  | (0, 20)   |
| **A1 (You)**                  | (6, 2)    | (4, 4)    |

This is **not** a prisoner’s dilemma, but a coordination game with a twist.

- You get highest payoff (10) when both play A0.
- If you play A0 and other plays A1, you get 0 → bad.
- If you play A1 and other plays A0, you get 6 → better than 0, but worse than 10.
- If both play A1, you get 4.

So:
- A0 is good if the other plays A0.
- A1 is safer: you get at least 4, and avoid getting 0.

But note: if you play A1, you get 6 when other plays A0 (better than 0), and 4 when other plays A1 (better than 0, worse than 10).

---

### **Step 2: Understand the delegation mechanism**

You can choose to **delegate** your move to a **mediator**, or act independently.

Before delegation, you and the other player **approve** mediators via **approval voting**.

Only the **mediators with the maximum number of approvals** are candidates.

Then, **one of those top-approved mediators is chosen uniformly at random**.

This mediator then plays on your behalf **based on how many players delegated to it**.

You are only concerned with **maximizing your expected points**.

So: your strategy is **which mediators to approve**, knowing that the final mediator will be selected randomly from the most approved ones.

---

### **Mediator Designs**

#### **M1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> • If 1 player delegates to the mediator → play **A1**  
> • If 2 players delegate to the mediator → play **A0**

This is a strategic mediator. It adapts based on delegation count.

- If only **you** delegate → M1 plays **A1**
- If **both** delegate → M1 plays **A0**

So, M1 encourages coordination toward A0 when both players use it.

---

#### **M2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> • If 1 player delegates → play **A0**  
> • If 2 players delegate → play **A0**

This mediator **always plays A0**, regardless of delegation count.

So:
- Whether 1 or 2 delegate, it plays A0.

So it's a **strong pro-coordination A0** mediator, even if only one person uses it.

---

### **Step 3: Consider incentives and possible outcomes**

We need to analyze **what happens under different delegation scenarios**, and **how your approval decisions affect your expected payoff**, **in expectation over which mediator is chosen**, considering both players’ likely behavior.

But: **the other player is an opponent**, likely trying to maximize their own payoff.

So we need to think strategically.

But here’s the key: **you are choosing your approvals *before* knowing what the other player will do**, and **the mediator is selected uniformly at random from the most approved ones**.

So we must consider **possible joint approval patterns**, and **which mediators you want to be chosen**, **and whether approving them increases the chance of getting a good mediator**.

But note: we are **not** committing to delegate. We are just deciding which mediators to **approve**, and the mediator will be selected at random from those with the highest approval count.

So your approval choices affect the **pool** of possible mediators, and the **likelihood** of which one ends up being used.

---

### **Step 4: Simulate likely behaviors**

Let’s think about what the **other player** will do.

The other player is trying to maximize their own points.

So they also have to decide which mediators to approve — but we are only responsible for **your own approvals**.

But we must **predict** that the other player will act strategically, so we can anticipate the final selection.

So we must think: **if you approve M1, M2, or neither, what will the final mediator likely be?**

We’ll evaluate **how each approval affects expected payoff**, depending on **what the other player does**.

But since we don’t know their choices, we must consider **robustness** — **which mediators are good under a variety of scenarios**.

Alternatively, we can use a **rational expectations** approach: **what would a rational player 2 do?**

Let’s assume both players act rationally.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze M1 (Player 1’s mediator)**

M1:
- 1 delegate → plays A1
- 2 delegates → plays A0

So:
- If **only you** delegate → you get A1 → your action is A1
- If **both** delegate → mediator plays A0 → so you get A0

Now, if you are the only one to approve M1, and the other player approves M2 (say), then M1 gets 1 approval, M2 gets 1 (if they approve it), so **both have max approval = 1**, so winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance M1 is used.

But if the other player also approves M1, then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1, so M1 wins.

But let’s look at **what you get** if M1 is used.

- If M1 is used and **you delegate** → your action depends on how many delegated.
    - If you're the only one: you play A1
    - If both delegate: you play A0
- If you don't delegate → your action is what you choose.

But in this setup, **your move is only delegated *if* the mediator is chosen and you have delegated**.

But **the "delegation" decision comes *after* mediator selection** — actually, no, reread.

Wait: **the process is:**
1. You and the other player **approve mediators** via voting.
2. Then, **one mediator is selected at random among those with max approval**.
3. Then, **each player chooses whether to delegate to it or act independently**.

But the problem says:
> "you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator"

So:
- After selecting the mediator, you decide whether to delegate.
- But the mediator only acts **if someone delegates**.

But the mediator’s strategy depends on **how many players have delegated to it**.

So the **delegation decision is made after** the mediator is selected.

Thus, **you decide to delegate or not based on who the mediator is**.

---

### **Step 6: Clarify the full sequence**

Correct sequence:

1. **Approval phase**: You and the other player each approve some mediators.
2. **Selection phase**: Among mediators with the **maximum number of approvals**, one is chosen **uniformly at random**.
3. **Delegation phase**: Each player decides whether to **delegate** to the selected mediator or act independently.
4. **Action execution**: Based on delegation decisions, the selected mediator plays (if enough players delegated), and you act or delegate.

But: **the mediator’s action depends on how many players delegated to it**.

So, for example:
- If the selected mediator is M1:
    - If **0** delegates → M1 doesn't act.
    - If **1** delegates → M1 plays A1.
    - If **2** delegates → M1 plays A0.

So your choice to delegate affects what the mediator does.

Similarly for M2: always plays A0, whether 1 or 2 delegate.

---

### **Step 7: Re-evaluate your goal**

You want to **maximize your expected points**.

Your strategy: 
- Decide which mediators to **approve**, 
- Then, based on **which mediator is selected**, decide whether to **delegate or not**.

So you can condition your delegation decision on **which mediator is in use**.

This is crucial.

Now we can analyze **your optimal response to each possible selected mediator**.

So let’s suppose **M1** is selected.

Then:
- M1: 1 delegate → A1; 2 delegates → A0.
- You decide whether to delegate; the other player does too.

Let’s suppose **you are considering whether to delegate to M1**, and the other player is doing likewise.

But remember: **you are also deciding which mediators to approve**, so you can influence which mediator is selected.

So your **approval** affects **which mediator is likely to be chosen**, and then you respond optimally based on that.

So let’s consider: **what would you prefer**?

---

### **Step 8: Compare M1 and M2 in terms of control and payoff**

Let’s suppose **M1 is selected**.

Then the mediator plays:
- A1 if exactly one person delegates to it
- A0 if both delegate

Now, **you choose whether to delegate**. The other player also chooses.

You need to decide: **should you delegate? What should the other player do?**

But we assume both players are rational and trying to **maximize their own payoff**.

So let’s analyze **a subgame**: what happens if **M1 is selected**?

---

#### **Subgame: M1 is selected**

Actions: Each player chooses → delegate or not.

Then:
- If both delegate → M1 plays A0 → you get A0, other gets A0 → you get 10
- If only you delegate → M1 plays A1 → you get A1, other plays (their own action) → what is the other's action? We don't know yet.

Wait — actually, **if you delegate**, your action is determined by the mediator → A1 (since only you delegated) → so you play A1.

The other player — if they don’t delegate — chooses their own action.

Similarly, if the other player does not delegate, they choose A0 or A1 based on their own strategy.

So we must assume **both players act strategically in the delegation phase**, knowing the mediator’s rules and the payoffs.

Let’s suppose **you are deciding whether to delegate** to M1, and you know the other player is also rational.

But you don’t know their **approval pattern** — but you can **predict** their behavior.

So let’s suppose M1 is selected. What will happen?

Let’s define the game.

Suppose **M1 is selected**.

Each player chooses: **delegate** or **independent action**.

Let’s suppose **you** consider what to do.

Let’s suppose the **other player** is also rational.

Let’s look at **your best response** to the other player’s action.

But we don’t know what the other player will do — but we can **find Nash equilibria**.

Alternatively, **think about which outcomes are stable**.

But first, let’s look at **possible outcomes** when M1 is selected:

| You delegate? | Other delegate? | M1 plays | You do | Other does |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|--------|------------|
| No            | No              | N/A      | You choose | Other chooses |
| Yes           | No              | A1       | A1       | Other chooses |
| No            | Yes             | A1       | You choose | A1         |
| Yes           | Yes             | A0       | A0       | A0         |

Now, **payoffs depend on what you and other do**.

But we can model this as a **subgame** where players choose:

- Delegation: yes/no
- (if not delegating) action: A0 or A1

But the payoffs are **not directly known** because the other player chooses **both whether to delegate and what action to take**.

But let’s suppose both players are rational and **will choose actions to maximize their own payoff**.

So we can analyze **equilibrium**.

Let’s look at **what players might do**.

Suppose **M1 is selected**.

**What happens in equilibrium?**

Let’s suppose **both players expect** that the other might delegate.

But M1 only plays A1 when only one delegates — A0 when both do.

So if **both players delegate**, then M1 plays A0 → both get A0 → you get 10, other gets 10.

If **only one delegates**, then M1 plays A1 → the delegating player gets A1, the other gets to choose their action.

If **neither delegates**, then both choose independently, and we are back to the base game.

So: Is there an equilibrium where **both delegate**?

Suppose both expect the other to delegate.

Then if you delegate, M1 plays A0 → you get 10.

If you **don’t** delegate, you choose A0 or A1.

- If you choose A0, and other chooses A0 → you get 10 (same)
- If you choose A1, and other chooses A0 → you get 6 (worse than 10)

So you want to choose A0 → then you get 10.

So by not delegating, you can get **at most 10**, same as delegating.

But if you don’t delegate, and other does, then M1 plays A1 → so other gets A1.

But the other will not want to get A1 if they can avoid it — especially if you choose A0.

Let’s look at **incentives**.

Suppose **you do not delegate**, and **other delegates**.

Then M1 plays A1 → other plays A1.

You get to choose your action.

You want to maximize your payoff.

If you choose A0 → you get 0 (since other plays A1) → bad.

If you choose A1 → you get 4 → better than 0.

So you choose A1 → you get 4, other gets 4.

Similarly, if **you delegate**, and **other does not**, then you play A1, other can choose.

- If other chooses A0 → you get 0, other gets 20 → they love that.
- If other chooses A1 → you get 4, other gets 4.

So other will choose A0 → because it gives them higher payoff (20 vs 4).

So: if only one delegates, **the non-delegating player chooses A0**, the delegating player gets A1.

Now, let’s see:

- If both delegate: both get A0 → you get 10
- If only you delegate: you get A1, other gets A0 → you get 0
- If only other delegates: you get A1, other gets A1 → you get 4
- If neither delegates: back to base game; but players will play some strategy.

But in the **neither** case, both choose actions.

Let’s suppose they play a Nash equilibrium in the original game.

In the original game, what is the Nash equilibrium?

Payoff matrix:

|       | A0      | A1      |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A0** | 10,10   | 0,20    |
| **A1** | 6,2     | 4,4     |

Look for pure NE:

- (A0, A0): (10,10) — best for player 1? If you deviate to A1, you get 6 < 10 → no incentive. Other same. So **(A0,A0) is a pure NE**
- (A0,A1): (0,20) — you get 0, you want to switch to A1 → then get 4 > 0 → not NE
- (A1,A0): (6,2) — other gets 2, they want to switch to A1 → get 4 > 2 → not NE
- (A1,A1): (4,4) — if you deviate to A0, you get 0 < 4 → no. Other same → so **(A1,A1) is a pure NE**

So **two pure NE**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

There may be a mixed equilibrium, but let’s assume players can coordinate on (A0,A0) or play (A1,A1) for safety.

But (A0,A0) is better for you (10 vs 4), so players may try for that.

But in the absence of communication, (A1,A1) is safer.

Anyway, let’s return.

In M1 subgame:

- If both delegate → both get 10 (via A0)
- If only you delegate → you get 0 (A1, other plays A0)
- If only other delegates → you get 4 (A1, other plays A1)
- If neither delegates → you get either 10 (if they both play A0) or 4 (if they both play A1) or less

But suppose **neither delegates** → both play A0 → you get 10

So:
- If you delegate: you get 0 (if other doesn’t delegate) or 10 (if both do)
- But you don’t know what the other will do.

Suppose you **anticipate that the other player will delegate**.

Then if you delegate → both delegate → you get 10

If you don’t delegate → only other delegates → you get A1, other gets A1 → you get 4

So you prefer to delegate → get 10 > 4

Similarly, other player gets 10 if you delegate, 4 if you don’t.

So both want to delegate.

So **(both delegate) is a stable equilibrium** when M1 is selected.

Similarly, if you **don’t expect the other to delegate**, then:
- If you delegate → you get 0
- If you don’t → you can get 10 (if both play A0) or 4

So you prefer to **not delegate** and play A0 → get 10

But if the other also doesn’t delegate, and plays A0, then you get 10.

But if you expect the other **not to delegate**, you should also not delegate.

But now, **if you both don’t delegate**, you get 10.

But if **you** both **want to deviate** to delegate?

Suppose you both are in (neither delegate, both play A0) → you get 10.

But if **you** unilaterally delegate → then only you delegate → M1 plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays A0 → you get 0 < 10 → not worth it.

Similarly for other.

So (neither delegate, both play A0) is also **a stable outcome**.

But now, two possible outcomes depend on coordination.

But under M1, **both (both delegate → A0) and (neither delegate → A0) give you 10**.

But the **neither delegate** case depends on both playing A0 — which requires coordination.

In contrast, **both delegate** → guaranteed A0 → you get 10.

So **both delegation leads to 10 regardless of what the other does** — because if both delegate → M1 plays A0.

But if only one delegates, you get 0 or 4.

So **a rational player might prefer to delegate**, because it **guarantees A0**, whereas not delegating risks getting 0.

So **if you expect the other to delegate**, you should delegate.

If you don’t expect that, you might not.

But **if both are rational and realize that both delegating leads to 10**, and not delegating leads to risk, they may **coordinate on both delegating**.

So it’s plausible that when M1 is selected, **both players delegate**, and you get 10.

But is it *uniquely* stable?

Suppose one player doesn’t delegate — then the other gets 4 if they delegate.

So if you delegate and other doesn’t — you get 0 → worse.

So you only want to delegate if you **expect the other to do the same**.

But **both have incentive to delegate only if they believe the other will**.

But if both believe that, they both delegate → 10.

So (both delegate) is a **self-confirming** equilibrium.

Also, (neither delegate, both play A0) is an equilibrium.

But in that case, you get 10.

So **M1 leads to expected payoff of at least 10**, if both players coordinate.

But if coordination fails, you might get 4 or 0.

But given that there’s a safe way to get 10 (both delegate), and it’s a Nash equilibrium, we can assume **players will coordinate on that**.

So: **under M1, if selected, both players likely delegate, and you get 10.**

---

Now consider **M2** (Proposed by Player 2)

M2:
- Always plays A0, regardless of number of delegates.

So:
- If you delegate → you play A0
- If other delegates → they play A0
- If only you delegate → you play A0
- If both delegate → both play A0
- If neither delegates → back to base game

So **no matter what**, if you delegate, you get A0.

Similarly, if the other delegates, they get A0.

So what happens?

Suppose M2 is selected.

Then you can:
- Delegate → you get A0
- Or not delegate → you choose A0 or A1

If you don’t delegate, what should you do?

If you expect the other to delegate → they play A0

Then you are better off playing A0 → get 10

If you play A1 → get 6 < 10

So you play A0 → get 10

If other does **not** delegate → you can play A0 → get 10, or A1 → get 4

So either way, you play A0.

So **if M2 is selected**, **you will play A0**, whether you delegate or not.

But if you delegate → you get A0 → same

Why delegate? You don’t gain anything.

But you *could* delegate, but it gives no benefit.

So **no incentive to delegate**, unless you get some benefit — but you don’t.

You get A0 either way.

So **best to not delegate**, and play A0.

But if the other player doesn’t delegate, and plays A0, you get 10.

So under M2, **you will play A0**, and the other player **will play A0**, so you get 10.

Wait, is that certain?

Only if the other player also plays A0.

But if the other player is rational, and M2 is selected, they know:

- If they don’t delegate, they get to choose — so they will choose A0 → get 10 if you play A0
- If you play A1, they get 20? No.

Wait — if M2 is selected, and the other player **does not delegate**, they **choose** their action.

So if **you** play A0, and they play A1 → they get 20 → great for them.

So why would they play A0?

Ah! This is **critical**.

If M2 is selected, and you do **not** delegate, you play A0.

Then the other player, if they **do not delegate**, can choose A1 → and get 20 (since you play A0).

And they get 20, which is best for them.

So **if you don’t delegate, and they don’t delegate**, the other player will play A1, you get 0.

So: if M2 is selected:

- If you delegate: you get A0
- If you don’t delegate: other player gets to choose, and will choose A1 (since you play A0) → you get 0

So **you want to delegate** — so you get A0, and avoid 0.

Similarly, other player: if they delegate → get A0
If they don’t → can choose A1 → but only if you play A0

But **you** are trying to avoid 0.

So **if you delegate**, you get A0
If you don’t, you get 0 (because other will play A1)

So you **must delegate** to avoid 0.

But if you don’t delegate, other will play A1 → you get 0.

So you **prefer to delegate**.

Similarly, other player: if you delegate → you play A0 → so they can play A1 → get 20

So **if you delegate**, and they don’t, they get 20

So they want to **not delegate**, and play A1.

But if they **do not** delegate and play A1, you get 0 → but you are better off delegating to avoid that.

But if **you** delegate → you play A0 → other can get 20 by not delegating and playing A1

So they **will not delegate** and play A1

But now, if you delegate, you get 0

So you **don’t want to delegate**, because you get 0

So:

- If you delegate → you get A0 → other plays A1 → you get 0
- If you don’t delegate → you can play A0 → other plays A1 → you get 0

So either way, you get 0?

But wait.

If you **don’t delegate**, you can play A1 → then if other plays A1, you get 4

Or if you play A0 → you get 0

So if you don't delegate, you should play A1 → because if other plays A1, you get 4; if they play A0, you get 10.

But **they will not play A0** — they will play A1 to get 20.

And they know: if you don’t delegate, they can play A1 → get 20.

So they **will play A1** if you don’t delegate.

So:
- If you delegate: you play A0 → they play A1 → you get 0
- If you don’t delegate and play A1: you play A1, they play A1 → you get 4

So you get **4** if you don’t delegate and play A1.

Better than 0.

So **you should not delegate**, and play A1.

Similarly, the other player: if you play A1, they get:
- If they don’t delegate → they can choose A0 → get 2 → bad
- Or A1 → get 4 → better

So they play A1.

So in equilibrium: **both play A1**

- You don’t delegate → you play A1
- Other doesn’t delegate → plays A1
- So outcome: A1, A1 → you get 4

Even though M2 always plays A0, **no one delegates**, so it doesn’t matter.

So **under M2**, if selected, **players end up playing (A1,A1) → you get 4**

Alternatively, if **both delegate**, then both play A0 → you get 10

But if both delegate, you get 10, but the other player gets A0, and if they don’t delegate, they could get 20 by playing A1.

So they **won’t want to delegate**.

So **only if both players want to delegate**, but they don’t — because each player gets **better payoff by not delegating**.

Specifically:

- If you delegate, you play A0 → other plays A1 → get 0
- If you don’t delegate, you play A1 → get 4

So you prefer not to delegate.

Similarly, other player: same.

So **no one delegates**, both play A1 → you get 4.

So **under M2, you get 4**

But under M1, if both delegate, you get 10

And we argued that **both players have incentive to delegate under M1**, because:
- If both delegate → A0 → you get 10
- If only one delegates → you get 0 or 4, which is worse
- So both want to delegate to avoid getting 0

Thus, under M1, **you can both coordinate on delegation → get 10**

So **M1 leads to 10**, **M2 leads to 4**

Therefore, **M1 is much better for you**.

But only if **M1 is selected**.

Now, **you and the other player approve mediators**.

You want to **increase the chance that M1 is selected**, or at least not have M2 selected.

But M2 is proposed by the other player.

The other player is trying to maximize their own payoff.

So let’s think: what will the other player approve?

Suppose **you approve only M1**.

Then M1 has 1 approval.

If the other player approves M2 → then M2 has 1 approval.

So both have 1 → max is 1 → randomly selected → 50% M1, 50% M2.

Then your expected payoff:
- If M1 chosen: you get 10
- If M2 chosen: you get 4
- So expected: 0.5*10 + 0.5*4 = 5 + 2 = 7

But if **you approve both**, then M1 has 1 (yours), M2 has 1 (their?) — wait.

But the other player will also decide.

Suppose **you approve M1**.

The other player: if they approve only M2, then both have 1 approval → random.

But if **you approve M1 and M2**, and the other player approves **only M2**, then:
- M1: 1 approval (yours)
- M2: 2 approvals (their and yours) → M2 gets 2, M1 gets 1 → so M2 wins.

So **M2 is selected** → you get 4.

But you want to avoid that.

So if you approve **only M1**, and other approves **only M2**, then both have 1 → random → 50% M1 → you get 10, 50% M2 → you get 4 → expected 7

But if you **don’t approve M2**, and the other player **doesn’t approve M2**, then M2 has 0, M1 has 1 → M1 wins.

But if the other player doesn’t approve M2, and you approve M1, then M1 wins.

But the other player is likely to approve M2, because it’s their proposed mediator.

So **M2 is likely to be approved by them**.

So if **you approve only M1**, and they approve M2, then both have 1 → random → expected 7

If you approve **both**, and they approve M2, then M1:1, M2:2 → M2 wins → you get 4 → worse.

If you approve **neither**, then M1:0, M2:1 → M2 wins → you get 4 → worse.

So **best for you: approve only M1**

Then, if they approve M2, random selection → 50% good (M1), 50% bad (M2) → expected 7

But is there a better choice?

What if you approve **only M2**?

Then if other approves M2, M2 has 2, M1 has 0 → M2 wins → you get 4 — bad.

Worse.

So **you should approve only M1**.

But what if the other player approves only M1?

Then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → you get 10 → best.

But we can’t control that.

But **in all cases**: approving **only M1** gives you **at least 7**, and possibly 10.

Approving M2 or both gives you at most 7, and possibly 4.

So **approving only M1 is best**.

Also, **M1 is advantageous** because it encourages coordination on A0.

M2 is bad because it leads to A1,A1.

So:

- You approve M1
- You **do not approve** M2

Thus:

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": false}

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Think about the question step by step.

Let's go step by step to determine which mediators to approve.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)

We are Player 1. The payoff matrix is:

| Your Action ↓ \ Other's Action → | A0 (Other) | A1 (Other) |
|----------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                           | 10, 10     | 0, 20      |
| **A1**                           | 6, 2       | 4, 4       |

We want to **maximize our own points**.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria or best responses.

#### Best Response Analysis:
- If other plays A0:
  - You get: 10 (if A0) vs. 6 (if A1) → best to play A0
- If other plays A1:
  - You get: 0 (if A0) vs. 4 (if A1) → best to play A1

So your best response depends on what the other player does.

Let’s suppose we are mixing strategies:
Let $ p $ = probability you play A0
Let $ q $ = probability other plays A0

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: $ 10q + 0(1-q) = 10q $
- If you play A1: $ 6q + 4(1-q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

Set equal for indifference:
$ 10q = 2q + 4 $
$ 8q = 4 $ → $ q = 0.5 $

So, if other plays A0 with probability 0.5, you’re indifferent.

Similarly, for the other player:
- If you play A0: other gets 10 → if they play A0
- If you play A0: other gets 20 → if they play A1

So if you play A0 with probability $ p $, other’s payoff:
- Play A0: $ 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2 $
- Play A1: $ 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4 $

Set equal: $ 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 $ → $ -8p = 2 $ → $ p = -0.25 $? Not possible.

Wait — so when you play A0 with probability p, the other player’s best response is:
- Play A1 if $ 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 $ → $ 8p > -2 $ → always true
So **no matter what you do**, the other player prefers A1 over A0?

Wait: Let's recheck:

Other player’s payoff:
- Play A0: gets 10 (if you play A0) or 2 (if you play A1) → $ 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2 $
- Play A1: gets 20 (if you play A0) or 4 (if you play A1) → $ 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4 $

Compare: $ 16p + 4 $ vs $ 8p + 2 $

$ 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 $ → $ 8p > -2 $ → always true.

So **for all p in [0,1]**, A1 gives higher payoff to other player than A0.

→ So other player always prefers A1 regardless of your action.

Therefore, other player will **always play A1** in equilibrium.

Then, your best response: if other plays A1, you get 0 from A0, 4 from A1 → so you play A1.

**So the unique Nash equilibrium is: both play A1 → you get 4 points.**

But we want to **maximize our own points**, and we are allowed to delegate.

So perhaps delegation can help us do better.

---

### Step 2: The Delegation Mechanism

You can choose to **delegate** to a mediator, or act independently.

But first, there is **approval voting** to select **which mediators** are eligible.

- Two mediators are proposed:
  - **M1**: Proposed by Player 1
  - **M2**: Proposed by Player 2

They have **identical behavior**:
> - If 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1  
> - If 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0  

So M1 and M2 are **functionally identical**.

Let’s denote the mediator’s behavior:
- If only one person delegates to it → it plays A1
- If both delegate → it plays A0

So the mediator behaves like a **responsive rule**: it adapts its action based on how many people use it.

---

### Step 3: What is the Goal?

- You want to **maximize your expected points**.
- You can **approve** or **not approve** mediators in an **approval voting** process.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.

So:
- If you approve **only M1**, and M2 gets 0, then M1 wins.
- If both get approval, and both have same approval count, then one is picked uniformly at random.
- If you approve **neither**, no mediator wins → you **must act independently**.
- But note: approval voting is **simultaneous**. So you don’t know what others will do.

But **you are only asked to decide which mediators to approve**, assuming you are rational and want to maximize your expected payoff.

You do **not** know how many others will approve which mediators.

But you can assume that **the other player is also rational**, and trying to maximize their own payoff.

However, in this setup, **you are only deciding your approvals** — and you want to choose approvals to **maximize your expected payoff**, given that:
- The final mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

---

### Step 4: What does the mediator actually do?

The mediator:
- Plays A1 if **exactly one** player delegates to it
- Plays A0 if **both** players delegate to it

This means:
- If you delegate and other doesn’t: mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- If you don’t delegate and other does: same — you play A1
- If both delegate: mediator plays A0 → you play A0

Important: **Only the mediator’s choice matters** — it’s as if the mediator is playing for you.

But note: if both delegate, the mediator plays A0 → so **your action becomes A0**.

---

### Step 5: Strategic Implications of Delegation

Let’s consider possible scenarios.

Let’s suppose you **approve both M1 and M2**. Then, **both will be in contention**.

Suppose the other player approves both as well. Then both mediators have 2 approvals → maximum → random winner → you get **a 50% chance** that one of them is selected (and they are identical).

So **your choice of mediator is effectively random**, but **both are identical**.

Now, if you approve only one mediator, say M1, and the other player approves only M2, then:
- M1 has 1 approval
- M2 has 1 approval
→ Both have max (1), so winner is chosen uniformly → 50% chance.

But if **you approve M1, and the other player approves both**, then M1 has 1, others have 2 → M1 loses.

So **to win selection**, you need **at least as many approvals as others**.

But since you don’t know what the other player will do, we must reason about **likely outcomes**.

However, note that **you are trying to maximize your **expected score**, not just win a mediator.

Also, since **M1 and M2 behave identically**, their behavior is the same. So **you cannot distinguish them** based on outcome.

Thus, whether you approve M1 or M2 or both, the **potential outcome is the same**.

But here’s a key point:

> The final mediator is selected **uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So **your approval choice affects the probability** that a mediator is selected, and hence affects your expected payoff.

But since both mediators are identical, it doesn’t matter **which one** you pick — only **how many** you approve.

So let's consider the possible approval strategies.

---

### Step 6: Strategy Comparison — Should you approve mediators?

Let’s consider possible strategies and expected payoffs.

#### Strategy 1: Approve **neither** M1 nor M2

Then **no mediator wins** → you must **play independently**.

We concluded earlier: the rational equilibrium is both play A1 → you get **4 points**.

So **expected payoff: 4**

But wait — is that the only outcome?

Actually, in the base game, if you play A1 and other plays A1 → you get 4.

But what if you can coordinate? But there's no communication.

So yes — if both play optimally, you get 4.

But perhaps you can do better with delegation?

Let’s explore.

#### Strategy 2: Approve **only one** mediator (say M1)

You approve M1, not M2.

Suppose the **other player**:
- Approves neither → then M1 has 1, others have 0 → M1 wins → you delegate
- Approves only M1 → then M1 has 2, others 0 → M1 wins
- Approves only M2 → M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → max approvals = 1 → winner is chosen uniformly → so 50% chance mediator is M1 (i.e., you delegate, you get the action)
- Approves both → then M1 has 1, M2 has 2 → M2 wins → **you do not delegate**

So whether you delegate depends on the other player's choice.

Let’s compute your **expected payoff** under this, assuming the other player is rational and also wants to maximize their own payoff.

But since **you are only deciding your approvals**, we need to consider **what the other player will do**, and **how to best respond**.

But the question is: **You are making the approval decision, and you must choose approvals to maximize your expected points**, taking into account that the other player is trying to do the same.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** or plausible outcome in the approval stage.

Let’s think: **both mediators are identical** → so there’s no difference between them.

So the **only meaningful choice** is: how many to approve.

So possible approval patterns:
- Approve 0
- Approve 1 (either M1 or M2 or both? We have to pick for each)
- Approve 2

But since M1 and M2 are symmetric, **approving M1 and not M2** is symmetric to approving M2 and not M1.

So we can consider:
- Approve 0
- Approve exactly one (say M1)
- Approve both

Let’s evaluate expected payoff under each, **assuming the other player is also rational and will do the same kind of reasoning**.

Let’s suppose you approve **both** M1 and M2.

Then you approve both → you support both.

Then the other player must decide whether to approve neither, one, or both.

But if both players approve both mediators, then:
- M1: 2 approvals
- M2: 2 approvals
→ max = 2 → both are in contention
→ winner is chosen uniformly → 50% chance you use M1, 50% M2 → but both same → so you delegate, and the mediator plays based on how many delegates.

Now, how many delegates? Depends.

If you **approve both**, and the other player also approves both → then **both players delegate to the mediator** → so 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0 → so you play A0.

So your action is A0.

But what if the other player **does not delegate**?

The other player’s decision depends on **whether they approve**, not whether they delegate.

Ah — important: **Delegation and approval are separate**.

Approval → gives you influence on who becomes the mediator.

But **whether you delegate** is determined by **whether the mediator is selected** and **your willingness to delegate**.

Wait — **when do you delegate**?

From the rules:
- You can **choose to delegate** or act independently.

But the **mediator can only be used if you have approved it**, and it wins.

But you must **choose to delegate** only **if** the mediator is selected.

So the sequence is:
1. You and other player **approve** mediators.
2. A winning mediator is chosen (uniformly from max-approved).
3. Then, **you and the other player decide whether to delegate to the mediator** (based on your interest).
4. The mediator then plays based on how many have delegated.

Wait — but the rules say:
> "you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator."

So **after** the mediator is selected, you can choose to delegate.

But you only have that option **if you approved the mediator**.

So if you don't approve a mediator, you can't delegate to it.

So to delegate, two conditions:
- The mediator is selected as the winning mediator
- You choose to delegate to it

But here’s the nuance: **the mediator is only valid if you approved it**. But the **other player** may or may not have approved it.

So **you can only delegate to a mediator if you approved it AND it is selected**.

But in this setup, only one mediator is selected. And it must have **max approvals**.

So if you approve a mediator and it wins, then you **can** delegate.

But you are not **forced** to.

So the **delegation decision** is **after** the mediator is selected.

But the question is: **you are not choosing to delegate yet** — you are only doing **approval voting**.

So the **delegation decision** happens later, and depends on whether the mediator is selected.

But to **maximize your expected payoff**, you need to think about **what you will do when the mediator is selected**.

But in **this phase**, you’re only deciding **which mediators to approve**.

So your **final expected payoff** depends on:
1. What mediators are eligible (i.e., approved by you and others)
2. Which one wins (random among max-approved)
3. Whether you choose to delegate or not (after seeing winning mediator)
4. Whether the other player chooses to delegate
5. Then the mediator plays based on number of delegators

But the **mediator plays based on how many players delegate**, not based on approvals.

So final action depends on:
- Who delegates (you and/or other)
- Then mediator plays A0 if both delegate, A1 if only one

And your payoff depends on your action (which is the mediator’s action) and the other player’s action.

So we need to model **what you will do when the mediator is selected**, given your approval choices.

Let’s suppose you approve **both M1 and M2**.

Then, if either M1 or M2 is selected (and they both behave the same), you can delegate.

You will delegate **if it benefits you**, i.e., if you expect to get more points by delegating than by playing independently.

Similarly, the other player may delegate or not.

So let’s now analyze **what your strategy for delegation** should be after the mediator is selected.

Assume that you approved both M1 and M2 → so if either is selected, you can delegate.

Because the behavior is identical, it doesn’t matter which is selected.

So if a mediator is selected (i.e., wins), you can choose to delegate or not.

The **mediator will play A1 if exactly one player delegates**, A0 if both delegate.

So your decision to delegate depends on what the other player will do.

Let’s suppose **you are facing a potential mediator** that would play **A1 if only one delegates**, **A0 if both**.

You need to decide: should you delegate?

But note: **you don’t know what the other player will do** — but you must choose a strategy.

So let’s suppose you are in a **subgame** where the mediator has been selected (e.g., M1), and you are deciding whether to delegate.

You know you approve it, so you can delegate.

The other player may or may not delegate — depends on whether they approved it and whether it won.

But we need to consider **what outcomes emerge in equilibrium**.

Let’s try to find **a symmetric equilibrium** in the approval stage.

Assume symmetry: both players play the same strategy.

Possible symmetric strategies:

#### Case 1: Both players approve **neither**

Then no mediator → everyone plays independently.

As established: best response is both play A1 → you get 4.

So expected payoff = 4.

#### Case 2: Both players approve **exactly one** of M1 or M2

Say, both approve M1.

Then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.

Now, both players can delegate to M1.

Now, each player decides whether to delegate.

Let’s suppose you decide to delegate.

Then:
- If you delegate and other does not: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- If both delegate: two delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
- If neither delegates: no delegation → both play independently

So, you need to decide: should you delegate?

Let’s compute your **best response** if the other player is also rational.

Let’s suppose both players follow the same strategy: **delegate if the mediator is selected**.

Then both delegate → both play A0 → you get 10 points (if other plays A0) → payoff = 10

Wait: if both delegate, mediator plays A0 → so both play A0 → so you get 10 points.

But is that a good outcome? Yes!

But what if the other player **doesn’t delegate**?

Then if you delegate, you play A1 (since only one delegate), and other plays independently.

But what will the other player do?

If other player **does not delegate**, they play independently.

In the independent case, if you play A1, and they play A0, you get 6; they get 2.

But if the other player **does not delegate**, and you delegate, then:
- You play A1
- Other plays A0 (since they didn’t delegate, and assume they play independently)
→ you get 6, other gets 2

But if the other player **does not delegate**, and you **don’t delegate**, then both play independently.

What will they play?

If the other person plays independently, and if they think you will play A1, then they will play A1 (since A1 is best response to A1 → gives them 4 vs 0 from A0).

But if they think you will play A0, then they will play A1 (since A1 gives 20 vs 10).

So if both play independently, they will both play A1 → you get 4.

Back to your decision: should you delegate?

Suppose other player **will not delegate**.

Then:
- If you delegate: you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4
- If you don’t delegate: you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4

So indifferent.

But if the other player **will delegate**, then:
- If you delegate: both delegate → both play A0 → you get 10
- If you don’t delegate: you play independently → you play A1 (best response), other plays A0 → you get 6

So you prefer to delegate if other will delegate.

So **if you believe the other player will delegate, you should delegate**.

Now, what if other player believes you will delegate?

Then if other delegates, both delegate → they get 10

If they don’t delegate, and you delegate, they play A1, you play A0 → they get 20? No:

Wait:
- If you delegate and they don’t: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- So you play A1, other plays independently → so other must decide.

If other plays independently, and you are playing A1, they will play A1 (best response) → so other gets 4

But if they delegate, and you delegate, both play A0 → other gets 10

So they also prefer to delegate if you will.

Thus, **both players have incentive to delegate if the other does**, and if both anticipate that, then **delegation is a dominant strategy**.

So **in the subgame where a mediator is selected**, the **equilibrium is: both delegate**.

Because:
- If other delegates, you get 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → better to delegate
- If other doesn’t delegate, you get 4 either way → but you are indifferent, but may as well delegate to increase chance of coordination.

But even if indifferent, we can assume they deviate to cooperate if it doesn’t hurt.

So **in equilibrium: both delegate → both play A0 → you get 10 points**

**But wait**: is this a Nash equilibrium?

Suppose both expect both to delegate.

Then:
- If you deviate and don’t delegate, then only one delegate, so mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Other plays A0 (since they delegate → they play A0)
→ you get 6 points (from A1 vs A0) → worse than 10

So **you lose by deviating** → so it is stable.

Similarly, if you expect the other to delegate, you should delegate.

So **if the mediator is selected, both players will delegate**, and **both play A0**, so **you get 10 points**

Now, what about if only one player **approves** the mediator?

Suppose you approve both, but the other player approves only M2.

Then:
- M1: you approve → 1
- M2: you and other → 2
→ M2 wins (max approvals)

Now, M2 is selected.

You approved M2 → so you can delegate.

Other player approved M2 → so they can delegate.

So both can delegate.

Then, as above, both will delegate (equilibrium) → both play A0 → **you get 10**

Now, what if **you approve both**, other players approving **neither**?

Then:
- M1: 1 approval (you)
- M2: 1 approval (you)

So both have max (1) → winner is chosen uniformly → 50% chance M1 wins, 50% M2 wins.

Then, whichever wins, **you can delegate** (since you approved both).

You will delegate (as above).

Other player does **not** approve any mediator → so **cannot delegate** → so only you delegate.

So only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1

Other player plays independently → and will play A1 (best response) → you get 0 (A1 vs A1) → but wait:

- You play A1 (via mediator)
- Other plays A1 → you get 4

But if you delegate, and only one delegate, mediator plays A1 → you play A1

Other plays independently, and since you play A1, they best respond with A1 → get 4

So your payoff is 4

But if you didn’t delegate, you play independently — and play A1 → same result.

So you get 4.

But earlier, if both delegate, you get 10.

So **if only you delegate, you get 4**.

But if the mediator selects M2, and you can delegate, but other cannot — only you can → so only one delegate → so you play A1.

But you could **choose not to delegate**.

But if you don't delegate, you play independently — and you’ll play A1 → same as above.

So you get 4 either way.

So if only you delegate, you get 4.

But if both delegate, you get 10.

So you prefer **both to delegate**.

Now, back to the approval phase.

Let’s suppose you approve **both M1 and M2**, and the other player approves **neither**.

Then:
- M1: 1
- M2: 1
- Max = 1 → winner chosen at random: 50% M1, 50% M2
- You can delegate (since approved)
- Other cannot delegate (didn’t approve)
→ only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
→ other plays A1 → you get 4

So expected payoff = 4

But if the other player **approves both**, then:
- M1: 2
- M2: 2
→ max = 2 → winner random, but both same behavior
- Both can delegate → both will → both play A0 → you get 10

So your expected payoff depends on what the other player does.

But you don't know.

But if you **both approve both**, you get 10.

If you approve both, but other approves neither, you get 4.

So you get **higher payoff if other cooperates in approval**.

But **other player** wants to maximize **their own** payoff.

So let’s assume **symmetric** equilibrium.

Let’s consider the **symmetric strategy**: each player approves **both** mediators.

Then:
- Each has 2 approvals → max is 2 → both mediators win with 50% chance each → but same behavior
- Both can delegate
- Both will delegate → both play A0 → you get 10

Now, suppose **you deviate**: instead of approving both, you approve **only one**.

Say you approve only M1.

Now, if the other player still approves both, then:
- M1: 1 (you)
- M2: 2 (other) → M2 wins
- Now, you did **not approve M2** → so you **cannot delegate** to M2
- So you **must play independently**
- Other player approves M2, and M2 wins → so they can delegate

So other player will delegate → they play A0 (if both delegate, but only one delegate → they play A1)

Wait:

- Other player delegates (since they can and will)
- You don't delegate (because you didn’t approve M2)
→ so only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1
- You play independently → best response: you play A1 → get 4

So you get 4.

But if you had approved both, and both delegate, you get 10.

So you **lose** by approving only one.

Now, what if you approve **neither**?

Then if other approves both, M2 wins.

You cannot delegate → so you play independently.

Other player delegates → plays A1 (since only one delegate) → you play A1 → you get 4

Again, 4.

But if both approve both, you get 10.

So **in all cases where you approve fewer than both**, you get 4 or less, while if both approve both, you get 10.

So **by approving both, you get 10 if other does the same; 4 otherwise**.

But if you approve both, and other approves both → you get 10

If you approve both, and other approves neither → you get 4

But if you approve only one or zero, you can't get 10, and you get 4 or less.

So **approval of both is better**.

Now, what about the **other player**?

They face the same tradeoff.

If they approve both, and you do, they get 10.

If they approve both, and you approve neither, then:
- M1: you:0, them:2
- M2: you:0, them:2 → both have 2 → random winner → you can delegate? No, you didn’t approve → so you can’t delegate → you play independently

Other player delegates → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1

You play independently → best response A1 → get 4

But other player gets: you play A1, they play A1 → 4 points

So they also get 4.

But if they approve both, and you approve both, they get 10.

So they also want both to approve both.

But what if they **approve only one**?

Then if you approve both, then M1: you:2, them:1 → M1 wins

They can delegate

You can delegate

Both delegate → both play A0 → they get 10

Same as before.

So **if they approve only one, but you approve both, they still get 10**.

But if they approve only one, and you approve only one, and both approve same mediator?

Say both approve M1.

Then M1 has 2, M2 has 0 → M1 wins

Both can delegate → both play A0 → each gets 10

So they get 10.

But if they approve only one, and you approve neither → then M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → random winner → say M1 wins → they can delegate → they play A1 (only one delegate) → you play independently → you play A1 → you get 4

They get 4?

Wait: they play A1, you play A1 → they get 4

So they get 4.

Same as before.

So **no matter what**, if both approve at least one, and both can delegate, and if the mediator plays A0 when both delegate, they get 10.

But the **only way to get 10 is if both delegate**.

And both will delegate only if both can and are willing.

And they are willing only if they can delegate.

So for a mediator to be used, **both must be able to delegate**, i.e., **both must have approved the mediator**.

But since there are two mediators, **if both players approve both**, then any selected mediator can be used by both.

But if only one mediators is approved by both, then that one will win (if others have fewer), and both can use it.

But the **key is**: **you and other must both be able to delegate** → so both must approve the winning mediator.

Since M1 and M2 are identical, it suffices that **both approve at least one**.

But if you approve both, then no matter which one wins, you can delegate.

Similarly for the other.

So **the best outcome is when both players approve both mediators** → then 10 each.

Now, if one player approves only one, and the other approves both, then:
- The mediator approved by both will win (if both approve it)
- Both can delegate → both play A0 → get 10

So **even if one player approves only one, if the other approves both, and they approve the same mediator, it works**.

But if **the mediators they approve are different**, say you approve M1, other approves M2, and both approve both, then both mediators have 2 → random winner → you can delegate → other can delegate → both play A0 → still 10.

So the **only situation** where you don’t get 10 is when **you or the other cannot delegate**.

And you **cannot delegate** only if you didn’t approve the **winning mediator**.

So to **maximize your chance of getting 10**, you should **approve both mediators**.

Because:
- If you approve both, then no matter which mediator is selected, you can delegate.
- If you approve only one, and it doesn’t win, you cannot delegate.

So **approving both maximizes your ability to delegate**.

Moreover, if both players do the same, both get 10.

Now, suppose you approve both, but other player approves only one.

Then:
- The mediator approved by both may win.
- But suppose you approve M1, M2; other approves M1.
Then:
- M1: 2 approvals
- M2: 1 approval
→ M1 wins
→ you can delegate (approved), other can delegate (approved) → both delegate → both play A0 → you get 10

So even if other approves only one, as long as it overlaps with yours, you get 10.

Only if the other player approves **only a mediator you did not approve**, then you cannot delegate even if it wins.

But if you approve both, then **you approve every possible mediator**, so **you can always delegate** if a mediator wins.

Therefore, **approving both mediators** ensures that you can delegate **regardless of which one wins**, and thus you can achieve the 10-point outcome if the other player cooperates.

Moreover, if the other player is rational and also wants to get 10, they will also want to approve both to ensure that they can delegate.

So in equilibrium, both players approve both.

And then both get 10.

If you approve only one, you risk not being able to delegate if the other wins.

But if you approve both, you are always safe.

And since the outcome is better, you **should approve both**.

Also, you get **at least 4**, possibly 10.

If you approve neither, you get only 4.

So **best to approve both**.

But what about the **other player**?

If you approve both, and the other player approves both, you get 10.

If you approve both, and the other approves only one, but same one, you get 10.

Only if they approve a different one and you don't approve it, you lose — but you do approve both.

So **you are safe**.

And since the other player also wants 10, they will likely approve both.

So **your best choice is to approve both**.

Now, what if you approve only one?

Then you might be unable to delegate.

So **approval of both is safer and better**.

Moreover, there is **no downside** to approving both — only upside.

There is **no cost** to approval.

So **you should approve both**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
To make an effective strategy in this decision-making game with the given setup, we need to analyze the payoff matrix, the mediator's behavior, and the possible outcomes based on my and Player 1's choices. I am Player 2 in this game.

Here's a breakdown of the payoffs:
1. If both choose A0: (10, 10)
2. If I choose A1, and Player 1 chooses A0: (20, 0)
3. If I choose A0, and Player 1 chooses A1: (2, 6)
4. If both choose A1: (4, 4)

Now consider the impact of delegating to the mediator:
- If only one player delegates (the other doesn't), the mediator chooses A1.
- If both players delegate, the mediator chooses A0.

Thus, the proposed strategy for Player 2 should consider not only the immediate payoffs but also the potential of coordination through the mediator.

### Possibility Analysis:

1. **Both players act independently:**
   - This can end up in any of the payoffs based on probabilities, ranging from (10,10) to (4,4).

2. **Only Player 1 delegates, I act independently:**
   - Mediator plays A1 for Player 1.
   - I should play strategically considering this:
     - If I play A1: Both get (4,4).
     - If I play A0: I get (2,6).

3. **I delegate, and Player 1 acts independently:**
   - Mediator plays A1 for me.
   - Player 1's possible actions:
     - If Player 1 plays A0: I get (20,0).
     - If Player 1 plays A1: Both get (4,4).

4. **Both delegate:**
   - Mediator will choose A0 for both, resulting in (10,10).

### Optimal Strategy:

Analyzing the possible scenarios, a mutually beneficial outcome (10,10) is obtained if both players delegate, as the mediator will guarantee an optimal collective outcome. Delegating to the mediator provides a mechanism to coordinate and maximize mutual benefits.

However, since I don't know Player 1's actions with certainty, a mixed strategy incorporating probabilities for A0, A1, and delegation (A2) must reflect my aim to maximize my expected payoff.

### Mixed Strategy Formulation:

- **High probability to delegate to the mediator (A2):** To increase the chances of reaching mutually beneficial outcomes (10,10).
- **Retain some probability on independent actions (A0, A1):** To safeguard points if Player 1 decides not to delegate, especially if they play unexpectedly.

A possible balanced probability distribution might be:

- **50% to A2 (Delegate to Mediator)**: Higher likelihood of reaching the 10,10 payoff.
- **25% to A0 (2nd likely independent desirable outcome)**.
- **25% to A1 (backup to catch high points if Player 1 doesn’t delegate).

### Final Answer:

Considering the reasoning above, a suitable probability distribution could be:

```json
{"A0": 25, "A1": 25, "A2": 50}
```

This specifies:
- 25% chance to independently choose A0,
- 25% chance to independently choose A1,
- 50% chance to delegate to the mediator.

Thus balancing between independent actions for unexpected cases and collaborating via mediation for optimal collective gains.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.


Instruction:
- Choose a probability distribution over the provided actions each round.
- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

response:
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game without Delegation**

We are Player 2 (the "you" in the problem). The other player is Player 1.

The base game payoff matrix (Player 2’s payoff, row; Player 1’s payoff, column) is:

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 10     | 2      |
| **P2: A1** | 20     | 4      |

So:
- If both play A0: (10, 10)
- You A1, P1 A0: (20, 0)
- You A0, P1 A1: (2, 6)
- Both A1: (4, 4)

This is a **non-zero-sum** game with asymmetric payoffs.

---

### **Step 2: Introduce Delegation (Action A2)**

You now have a **new action: A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

- If **you** delegate, the mediator will:
  - Play A1 **if only one player** has delegated to it.
  - Play A0 **if two players** have delegated to it.

The mediator is **neutral** – it only follows the rule based on the count of delegations.

But note: **You** can choose to delegate or not. So **both players** could potentially delegate. The mediator’s choice depends on **how many** players choose to delegate.

Let’s define the possible scenarios:

| Delegation by P1 | Delegation by P2 | Mediator’s Action |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| No               | No               | — (not used)      |
| Yes              | No               | A1 (only 1 delegation) |
| No               | Yes              | A1 (only 1 delegation) |
| Yes              | Yes              | A0 (both delegates) |

So:
- If only one person delegates → mediator plays A1
- If both delegate → mediator plays A0
- If neither delegates → both play their own choices

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Full Strategy Space**

Each player chooses a mixed strategy over A0, A1, A2 (delegate).

Let’s focus on **your** strategy as Player 2.

Let:
- `p` = probability you choose A0
- `q` = probability you choose A1
- `r` = probability you choose **A2 (Delegate)**

So: `p + q + r = 1` → `r = 1 - p - q`

You need to pick `(p, q, r)` to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 is also playing optimally (but possibly not cooperating).

But note: **You are rational and want to maximize your points.** So you must anticipate Player 1’s move.

But the twist is: **You can commit to delegate**, and the mediator’s action depends on the **global number** of delegations.

So this becomes a **game-theoretic meta-choice**: whether to delegate (with strategic implications), or not.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Strategic Implications of Delegation**

Delegation is **not just a random action** – it’s a **mechanism** that changes your effective move based on whether the other player also delegates.

Let’s consider what each player gains in different delegation scenarios.

---

#### **Case 1: No one delegates**
Then both players choose A0 or A1 independently.

Payoffs are as in original matrix.

---

#### **Case 2: Only one player delegates**
Say you delegate → mediator plays A1.

Then:
- You get payoff based on: **your action = A1** (since mediator plays A1)
- P1 plays whatever he chooses (A0 or A1)

So your payoff is:
- If P1 plays A0 → you get 20
- If P1 plays A1 → you get 4

But if **P1 delegates** and **you don’t**, then mediator plays A1 → P1's action is A1.

So your move is whatever you choose, and P1 is effectively playing A1.

So in this case, **the delegatee is forced to play A1**, the non-delegate plays their own choice.

---

#### **Case 3: Both delegate**
Then mediator plays A0 (since 2 delegations).

So **both** players effectively play A0.

Payoff: both get 10.

---

Let’s summarize the **effective outcomes** based on delegation choices:

| P1 Action | P2 Action | Resulting Actions | Your Payoff | P1's Payoff |
|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| A0       | A0       | A0, A0             | 10          | 10          |
| A0       | A1       | A1, A0             | 20          | 0           |
| A0       | A2 (Del) | A1 (M), A0         | 20 (since M→A1) | 0          |
| A1       | A0       | A0, A1             | 2           | 6           |
| A1       | A1       | A1, A1             | 4           | 4           |
| A1       | A2 (Del) | A1 (M), A1         | 4 (M→A1)      | 4          |
| A2 (Del) | A0       | A1 (M), A0         | 20          | 0           |
| A2 (Del) | A1       | A1 (M), A1         | 4           | 4           |
| A2 (Del) | A2 (Del) | A0 (M), A0         | 10          | 10          |

Note: Delegation doesn’t mean you *can’t* choose A0/A1 – you give up control and the mediator plays based on group size.

So the **actual** action you take (in terms of payoff) depends on delegation and the mediator’s rule.

---

### **Step 5: Consider Possible Equilibria**

We are looking for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies where no player wants to deviate.

But since you are optimizing for **your** payoff, and you can only choose your own mixed strategy, we must find the best **your** probability distribution over A0, A1, A2, assuming Player 1 is also rational and will play optimally.

But here’s a key: **You are Player 2**. So you can compute your best reply to an action profile (including any mix by P1).

Let’s try to see if there’s a **dominant strategy** or **best response**.

---

### **Step 6: Check if Delegation is Dominant or Advantageous**

Let’s suppose Player 1 chooses a strategy. What should you do?

Instead of solving the full Bayesian game, let’s consider **what happens if you delegate (A2)**.

#### If you delegate:
- If P1 does **not** delegate → **only one delegation** → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- If P1 **does** delegate → **two delegations** → mediator plays A0 → you play A0

So your expected payoff if you delegate is:
> **E[Payoff | you delegate] = (1 - q₁) × Payoff(A1, P1's choice) + q₁ × Payoff(A0, P1's choice)**  
but wait: actually, P1's choice is **not** A0 or A1 directly — it’s whatever he chooses.

Let’s define:
Let `s = probability Player 1 chooses A2 (delegate)`

Then:
- With prob `1 - s`: P1 does not delegate → you get A1 (mediator) → your payoff depends on P1’s action (A0 or A1)
- With prob `s`: both delegate → you both get A0 → you get 10

So:
> **E[you | you delegate] = (1 - s) × E[Payoff from opponent’s move] + s × 10**

But E[Payoff from your move when you delegate and P1 doesn’t] depends on what P1 does when he doesn’t delegate.

Suppose when P1 doesn’t delegate, he chooses A0 with prob `p₁`, A1 with prob `q₁`, etc.

But this is getting complex.

Let’s try to **assume symmetry** or **check for dominant strategies**.

---

### **Step 7: Try to Find a Symmetric Equilibrium**

Suppose both players are symmetric in their strategies.

But the payoffs are not symmetric:
- You get 20 if you A1 and P1 A0 → very high
- But if P1 A1 and you A0 → you get only 2
- Also, P1 gets 6 if you A0 and he A1 → better for him

So the game is **not symmetric**.

Let’s suppose we look for a **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

But instead of solving the full game, let’s **evaluate the value of delegation**.

---

#### **Key Insight: Delegation can lock in outcomes**

- If **you delegate alone**, you are forced to play A1 → you get 20 if P1 plays A0, 4 if P1 plays A1
- If **both delegate**, you both play A0 → you get 10

So **delegation can be risky**.

But if you **only delegate when you think P1 will also delegate**, you get 10 → better than 4, worse than 20.

But if you **delegate and P1 doesn’t**, you play A1, which is good **if P1 plays A0**.

So your best hope is: **you delegate**, and P1 **doesn’t delegate** → then you get A1, and if P1 plays A0 → you get 20.

But if he plays A1, you get 4 → worse than if you had played A0 and he played A1 (you get 2) — wait: 4 > 2, so still better.

Wait: if P1 plays A1 and you play A1 → you get 4

But if P1 plays A1 and you play A0 → you get 2 → so worse.

So actually, **playing A1 when P1 plays A1 is better than playing A0**.

So your payoff is higher when you play A1 vs A0 **against A1**.

But against A0:
- You get 20 if you play A1
- You get 10 if you play A0

So **A1 is strictly better than A0** when P1 plays A0.
- A1 gives 20 vs 10

But **A1 is worse than A0 when P1 plays A1?** No:
- A1 gives 4
- A0 gives 2 → so A1 is still better.

Wait! Look again:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - You A0 → 10
  - You A1 → 20 → so A1 is better
- If P1 plays A1:
  - You A0 → 2
  - You A1 → 4 → so A1 is still better!

So **A1 dominates A0** for you in the original game!

Is that true?

Yes:
- Against A0: 20 > 10 → A1 better
- Against A1: 4 > 2 → A1 better

So **A1 is a strictly dominant strategy for you in the original game**.

But wait — **this is only if you get to choose your action independently**.

Now, if you **delegate**, you **give up control**.

So the **only reason to delegate** is if you think that **you’ll end up playing A1** in a way that benefits you, or if delegation can **coordinate** or **induce cooperation**.

But in this case, since A1 dominates A0, **you should always want to play A1 if you can control your action**.

So why delegate?

Let’s check: if you delegate:
- If P1 doesn’t delegate → you play A1 → which is good
- If P1 does delegate → you play A0 → which you only get 10

But if you could **play A1 yourself**, you’d get 20 if P1 plays A0, or 4 if P1 plays A1.

But if you delegate and P1 also delegates, you both get 10 → that’s **worse than if you had played A1** and he played A1 → you get 4.

Wait: 10 > 4 → **10 is better than 4**.

So if both delegate → you get 10
If neither delegate and both play A1 → you get 4

So **10 > 4**, so **delegation might be better** in that case.

But you **don’t want to accidentally** get 10 if you could have gotten 20.

Wait — so there’s a trade-off.

Let’s compute your **expected payoff** under various scenarios.

But here's a better idea: **Since A1 dominates A0**, you should **never play A0** in independent play.

So if you are not delegating, you should play A1 with 100% probability.

But **if you delegate**, you might play A0 (if both delegate) — which is worse.

So **delegation can force you to play suboptimal moves**.

But is there a **benefit**?

Yes — **coordination**.

Suppose both players delegate → both get 10 → better than (4,4)

So if you *expect* the other player to delegate, you might want to delegate too to **avoid the bad (4,4) outcome** and get (10,10).

But if you **want** to get 20, you’d rather not delegate, and hope the other player plays A0.

But if you delegate, and the other player doesn't, you get A1 → good.

But if you can’t control it, it’s risky.

But since **A1 is dominant**, the **only bad outcome** for you is if you play A0 and P1 plays A1 → you get 2.

But if you play A1, you get at least 4.

So **your best independent strategy** is to play A1.

But then, if P1 also plays A1, both get 4 → low.

But if both **delegate**, both get 10 → good.

So **delegation can be used to enforce cooperation**.

But the mediator doesn’t care about fairness — it just follows a rule: 1 delegate → A1, 2 delegates → A0.

So **if both delegate, you both play A0 and get 10**.

That’s **better** than (4,4), so it’s a **Pareto improvement**.

But **if only one delegates**, that delegate plays A1, the other plays their own choice.

So if you delegate and P1 plays A0 → you get 20 → better.

But if P1 plays A1 → you get 4 → worse than if you played A1 yourself (which gives 4 anyway).

Wait: same payoff.

But **if you don't delegate**, and P1 plays A1, you get 4 if you play A1.

If you delegate, and P1 plays A1, you still get 4.

So payoff is same.

But **if P1 plays A0**:
- You play A1 → 20
- You delegate, P1 plays A0 → you get A1 → 20

Same.

So whether you delegate or not, **in all cases**, when the other player plays A0 or A1, your payoff is the same **if you are playing A1**.

But the **only difference** is when **both delegate** → then **you must play A0** → you get 10.

But if both **don’t delegate**, and both play A1 → you get 4.

So **10 > 4** → so as long as you can get **both to delegate**, you’re better off.

But **you don't control the other player**.

So what’s your best response?

Let’s suppose you try to **induce** cooperation.

But the mediator’s rule is **fixed**: both delegate → A0.

So the only way to get 10 is to both delegate.

But if you delegate alone, you get A1 → which is good if P1 plays A0.

But if P1 plays A1 → you get 4, same as if you played A1.

But if P1 plays A0, you get 20 regardless.

So **delegation doesn’t hurt you** when P1 plays A0 or A1 — it gives the same payoff as playing A1.

The **only downside** is if **both delegate** → you get 10 instead of 4 → **10 > 4**, so it’s actually **better**!

Wait a minute.

Let’s tabulate:

| Your Action | P1’s Action | Your payoff |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| A1 (play)  | A0         | 20          |
| A1 (play)  | A1         | 4           |
| A1 (via delegation, P1 not delegate) | A0 | 20 |
| A1 (via delegation, P1 not delegate) | A1 | 4 |
| A0 (via delegation, both delegate) | A0 | 10 |
| A0 (via delegation, both delegate) | A1 | 10 (but this case doesn't arise) |

Wait: the mediator only plays A0 if both delegate.

So your action is **only A1** if you delegate and P1 doesn’t, and **A0** if both delegate.

So only **when both delegate** do you play A0 → you get 10.

But if you play A1 yourself and P1 plays A1, you get 4.

So 10 > 4 → **delegation gives you better payoff in that case**!

In all other cases, you get the same as playing A1 yourself.

So **delegation is always at least as good as playing A1**, and **strictly better when both players delegate**, because then you get 10 instead of 4.

But is that correct?

Yes!

- If only you delegate → you play A1 → payoff: 20 vs A0, 4 vs A1 → same as if you played A1
- If both delegate → you play A0 → you get 10
- But if you played A1 yourself and P1 played A1 → you get 4
- So 10 > 4 → so better to delegate in that case

Therefore: **Delegation is never worse than playing A1**, and **sometimes better**.

But what about if you delegate and P1 also delegates — you get 10, which is better than 4.

But if you don’t delegate, and P1 plays A1, you get 4.

So if both players **randomly delegate**, you might get 10 instead of 4.

So **you have an incentive to delegate** to **get a higher payoff when both play A1**.

But what if you want to get 20?

You can only get 20 if P1 plays A0.

But if you delegate, and P1 plays A0 → you still get 20.

So **no loss**.

So delegation seems **dominant**?

Let’s compare:

- If you play A1:
  - vs P1 A0 → 20
  - vs P1 A1 → 4
- If you delegate:
  - if P1 not delegate → you play A1 → 20 if P1 A0, 4 if P1 A1
  - if P1 delegate → you play A0 → 10

So your payoff under delegation is:
> E[Payoff | you delegate] = Pr(P1 not delegate) × E[Payoff | P1's action] + Pr(P1 delegate) × 10

But if P1 does not delegate, and you delegate, you get same as if you played A1 → so same as above.

Let’s define:
Let `s` = probability P1 delegates

Then `1 - s` = P1 does not delegate

Let `p` = P1 plays A0 if he doesn’t delegate  
Then `1 - p` = P1 plays A1 if he doesn’t delegate

So:
> E[Payoff | you delegate] = (1 - s) × [p × 20 + (1 - p) × 4] + s × 10

Whereas if you play A1 yourself:
> E[Payoff | you play A1] = (1 - s) × [p × 20 + (1 - p) × 4] + s × 4

So the **difference**:
> E[delegate] - E[A1] = (1 - s) × [p × 20 + (1 - p) × 4] + s × 10 - [(1 - s) × same + s × 4]  
> = s × 10 - s × 4 = 6s

So:
> **Delegation yields 6s more than playing A1**

Since `s ≥ 0`, delegation is **at least as good**, and **better if s > 0**

Therefore: **Delegation is strictly better than playing A1 if the opponent has positive probability of delegating**

But what if **you are not sure** about P1’s strategy?

But as Player 2, you want to max your expected payoff, so you should **assume P1 plays some strategy**, and choose your best response.

But the insight is: **Delegation always gives at least as much as playing A1**, and more if P1 delegates.

So you should **never play A0** (since A1 dominates A0).

Now, should you play A1 or A2 (delegate)?

From above: **Delegation is always better than A1 if P1 delegates with any positive probability**.

But what if P1 **never** delegates?

Then:
- E[delegate] = (1 - 0) × [p × 20 + (1-p) × 4] + 0 × 10 = same as playing A1
- So no difference

But since delegation gives the same or better, **you might as well delegate**.

Moreover, if there’s **any chance** P1 delegates, delegation is strictly better.

So **unless you are certain P1 will never delegate**, delegation is better.

But is it possible for P1 to always not delegate?

Suppose P1 thinks the same way.

But P1 also has a choice.

But here’s the point: **You can commit to delegation**.

And **since delegation is never worse and often better**, **your best strategy is to delegate with 100% probability**, regardless of what P1 does.

Wait — let’s test this.

Suppose you play **A2 (delegate)** with probability 100%.

Then:
- If P1 never delegates → you play A1 → you get (P1’s action) → 20 or 4
- If P1 delegates → both delegate → you play A0 → you get 10

So your expected payoff depends on P1’s strategy.

But **if P1 also delegates with some probability**, you get 10 in that case.

But **if P1 does not delegate**, you get A1 → 20 if he plays A0, 4 if he plays A1.

So your payoff is a weighted average.

But crucially: **Is there any strategy for P1 that makes delegation bad for you?**

No — because even if P1 never delegates, you still get 20 or 4 — same as if you played A1.

And if P1 delegates, you get 10 > 4.

So delegation is **never worse** than playing A1.

Moreover, **if P1 delegates**, you get 10 instead of 4 — **+6 points**

So **unless you are certain P1 will never delegate**, delegation improves your expected payoff.

But even if P1 **definitely** never delegates, you are **not worse off**.

So **delegation is a weakly dominant strategy**.

Therefore: **You should always delegate**.

So your optimal strategy is: **Delegation (A2) with 100% probability**

But what about A0 and A1? They are dominated.

So you should assign 0 to A0 and A1.

---

### **Final Check: Is there any reason not to delegate?**

Suppose you are **really optimistic** about P1 playing A0.

But if P1 plays A0, you get 20 whether you delegate or not.

If P1 plays A1:
- If you play A1: you get 4
- If you delegate and P1 delegates: you get 10
- However, **if P1 plays A1 and you delegate**, you get 4 only if he doesn’t delegate → then you play A1 → 4

But if P1 delegates, you get 10.

So **delegation helps you when P1 might delegate**, even if he plays A1.

So in all cases, delegation is **weakly better**.

Therefore, **delegation is never worse**.

Thus, **the best strategy is to delegate with 100% probability**.

---

### **Answer**

Final probability distribution:

- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2 (Delegate): 100

This is weakly dominant and maximizes your expected payoff.

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game payoffs

From my perspective as Player 2:
- A0 vs their A0: I get 10
- A0 vs their A1: I get 2
- A1 vs their A0: I get 20
- A1 vs their A1: I get 4

Notice that A1 dominates A0 for me:
- Against their A0: 20 > 10
- Against their A1: 4 > 2

So I should never play A0 directly.

## Step 2: Incorporate the mediator option

The mediator plays:
- A1 when only 1 player delegates
- A0 when both players delegate

This creates an expanded payoff matrix:

**My payoffs:**
```
                Player 1's action
            A0      A1      A2(delegate)
A0          10      2       2
A1          20      4       4
A2          20      4       10
```

When Player 1 delegates alone, they get A1 from mediator (so I face A1).
When I delegate and they also delegate, we both get A0 (mutual cooperation: 10, 10).

## Step 3: Check for dominated strategies

- A1 strictly dominates A0 (all payoffs equal or better)
- A2 weakly dominates A1 (20≥20, 4=4, but 10>4)

For Player 1 (from their perspective):
- They also have A1 dominating A0
- They also have A2 weakly dominating A1 with the same reasoning

## Step 4: Find Nash equilibrium

After eliminating dominated strategies, both players should choose between A1 and A2.

If both delegate (A2, A2):
- I get 10, they get 10
- Can I improve? If I deviate to A1, I get 4 (worse)
- Can they improve? If they deviate to A1, they get 4 (worse)

This is a Nash equilibrium.

If both play A1:
- I get 4, they get 4
- Can I improve? If I deviate to A2, I get 10 (better!)

So (A1, A1) is NOT an equilibrium.

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning

The mediator creates a coordination mechanism that achieves the cooperative outcome (10, 10) which Pareto-dominates the standard Nash equilibrium (4, 4). Since this mediator was selected via approval voting, both players recognize its value. Delegating is the rational choice.

response:
Let the other player’s realized move be whatever comes out of their mixed strategy (including possibly delegating).

Key observation: choosing **A2 (Delegate)** makes my realized action depend on how many players delegate:
- If only I delegate (the other doesn’t): mediator plays **A1** for me.
- If both delegate: mediator plays **A0** for me.

Now compare my payoffs action-by-action against each possible thing the other player might end up doing:

1) **If the other ends up playing A0 (not delegating):**
- If I play A0 → I get 10  
- If I play A1 → I get 20  
- If I play A2 → mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegator) → I get 20  
So A2 is as good as the best (ties A1).

2) **If the other ends up playing A1 (not delegating):**
- If I play A0 → I get 2  
- If I play A1 → I get 4  
- If I play A2 → mediator plays A1 → I get 4  
So A2 is as good as the best (ties A1).

3) **If the other delegates (A2):**
- If I play A0, then only 1 player delegates (the other), so the other gets A1; I get 2 (A0 vs A1)
- If I play A1, the other gets A1; I get 4 (A1 vs A1)
- If I play A2 too, then 2 players delegate, mediator plays A0 for both; I get 10 (A0 vs A0)
So A2 is strictly best here.

Conclusion: **A2 strictly dominates A0 and weakly dominates A1**, and it’s strictly better than A1 exactly in the “both delegate” case. So the best strategy is to delegate with probability 1.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal mixed strategy for Player 1 (you), considering both the original game payoff structure and the new delegation option.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the game without delegation (standard game theory setup)**

The payoff matrix (from Player 1’s perspective, since Player 1 is you):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 10           | 0            |
| **Player 1: A1** | 6            | 4            |

So the payoffs for Player 1 are:

- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 0
- (A1, A0): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

Now, let's analyze the Nash equilibrium in the original game (without delegation), to get a baseline.

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with probability (1-p).  
Player 2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with probability (1-q).

Player 1's expected payoff:
- E1 = p*q*10 + p*(1−q)*0 + (1−p)*q*6 + (1−p)*(1−q)*4  
= 10pq + 0 + 6q(1−p) + 4(1−p)(1−q)  
= 10pq + 6q - 6pq + 4(1−p−q+pq)  
= (10pq - 6pq) + 6q + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq  
= 4pq + 2q + 4 - 4p + 4pq  
Wait, let's recompute carefully:

Let’s do it again:

E1 = p*q*10 + p*(1−q)*0 + (1−p)*q*6 + (1−p)*(1−q)*4  
= 10pq + 0 + 6q(1−p) + 4(1−p)(1−q)  
Now expand:

= 10pq + 6q - 6pq + 4(1 - p - q + pq)  
= (10pq - 6pq) + 6q + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq  
= 4pq + 2q + 4 - 4p + 4pq? Wait — 4pq from the last term?

Wait: 4(1 - p - q + pq) = 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq

So total:

10pq (from first term)  
+ 0  
+ 6q - 6pq  
+ 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq

Now sum all:

- pq terms: 10pq - 6pq + 4pq = 8pq  
- q terms: 6q - 4q = 2q  
- constants: 4  
- p terms: -4p

So E1 = 8pq + 2q - 4p + 4

Now, to find best response for Player 1, we would typically want to find a p that makes player 2 indifferent, but instead, we are now introducing a new **delegation** option.

But we should first see: what are the implications of the **delegation option**?

---

### **Step 2: Understand the delegation mechanism**

You can choose **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**, with the following rule:

- If **1 player** delegates to the mediator → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Note: **You are Player 1**, and **Player 2 is the other player**.

So possible delegation outcomes:

| You delegate (A2) | Player 2 delegates (A2) | Mediator action |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| No               | No                     | Neither plays; both choose own actions. |
| Yes              | No                     | Mediator plays A1 (only 1 delegator) |
| No               | Yes                    | Mediator plays A1 (only 1 delegator) |
| Yes              | Yes                    | Mediator plays A0 (2 delegators) |

So if **both** delegate → mediator plays A0

If only **one** delegates → mediator plays A1

But here’s the key: if **you** delegate, then **your action is determined by the mediator**, depending on whether the other player also delegates.

So **your own action is not chosen directly** — it is a function of the delegation decisions.

But the **delegation is part of your strategy choice**.

This is a **meta-decision**: you choose a probability to delegate, and the mediator's action depends on whether **only you**, **only the other player**, or **both** are delegating.

Now, you must choose a mixed strategy over **A0, A1, A2**, with probabilities summing to 100.

Let’s define:

Let:
- x = P(You play A0)
- y = P(You play A1)
- z = P(You play A2)

Then x + y + z = 100.

But note: if you choose A2, then your action is **not A0 or A1**, it’s **determined by the mediator** based on how many delegators there are.

So the actual **action** you play depends on the **delegation outcome**.

So to compute your expected payoff, you need to consider the joint possibilities of your choice and the other player's choice.

Let’s consider Player 2’s strategy. Since this is a symmetric game (though not symmetric payoffs), and the other player can also delegate or not, we must assume they are rational and will respond optimally.

But in this case, we are **only** optimizing **your** strategy to maximize **your** payoff, assuming the other player also plays optimally (i.e., we are seeking a Nash equilibrium).

So we need to find a mixed strategy for you (over A0, A1, A2), and we assume Player 2 will respond optimally.

But the mediator is **proposed by Player 2**, and **selected via approval voting**, so Player 2 has an interest in its existence. But the mediator's rule is fixed and known.

Now, the key is that **delegation is a strategic choice**, and the mediator's move depends on **how many** people delegate.

Let’s suppose that both players are rational and will play a symmetric or asymmetric strategy depending on incentives.

But instead of assuming symmetry, let’s think about **incentives**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze possible delegation outcomes and payoffs**

Let’s suppose that you are choosing a mixed strategy with probabilities:

- P(A0) = a
- P(A1) = b
- P(A2) = c
With a + b + c = 100

Similarly, let’s suppose Player 2 uses a mixed strategy:

- P(A0) = d
- P(A1) = e
- P(A2) = f
With d + e + f = 100

But we do not know f yet. We must find equilibrium.

But since we are to output only your strategy, and must assume the other player plays rationally, we must find a **best response** to **some equilibrium strategy**.

So instead of solving for full equilibrium immediately, let’s **consider what you gain** from the delegation option.

Let’s explore **all possible combinations of delegation**.

Let’s analyze the **expected payoff** to **you** under various delegation scenarios, **by considering the joint decisions**.

Let’s define the four possible delegation states for **your action** (since your action is not directly chosen if you delegate).

Case 1: You **do not delegate** (choose A0 or A1), and Player 2 **does not delegate**.

Then you both play pure strategies from A0/A1, and the payoffs are the original ones.

Case 2: You **delegate**, Player 2 **does not delegate** → only one delegator → mediator plays A1 → you play A1.

Case 3: You **do not delegate**, Player 2 **delegates** → only one delegator → mediator plays A1 → Player 2 plays A1.

Case 4: **Both delegate** → two delegators → mediator plays A0 → you play A0.

So the **effect of delegation** is that:

- If you delegate alone → you play A1
- If both delegate → you play A0
- If you don’t delegate → you play A0 or A1 based on your choice

So, the **delegation option allows you to conditionally play A1 or A0** depending on what the other player does.

But here’s the insight: **if you delegate, your "action" is conditional on coordination**.

Let’s now examine whether **delegation can be beneficial**.

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate benefits of delegation**

Let’s suppose that you **always** delegate (c=100). Then your action depends on Player 2:

- If Player 2 does not delegate → you get A1
- If Player 2 delegates → you get A0

So your payoff depends on **Player 2’s strategy**.

Similarly, if Player 2 always delegates, then:
- You (if you delegate) play A0
- If you don't delegate, your action is A0 or A1 as per your strategy

Let’s suppose **Player 2 also delegates with high probability**. Then if you delegate, you will play A0 (since both delegate), so you play A0 → but you could have played A0 anyway.

But if **Player 2 doesn’t delegate**, and you do, you play A1.

Is A1 better than A0? Let’s see:

From your perspective:

- If you play A0 against A0: 10
- A0 against A1: 0
- A1 against A0: 6
- A1 against A1: 4

So A1 is worse than A0 if the other plays A0, but better if the other plays A1 (6 > 0).

But A0 is dominant for a **fixed opponent**, except that A1 is better when opponent plays A1?

Wait: if you play A0 vs A1 → get 0
A1 vs A1 → get 4

So A1 is better than A0 against A1 → yes.

But against A0: A0 → 10, A1 → 6 → so A0 is better.

So there is no dominant strategy.

But now, delegation lets **you** get A1 when the other player does **not** delegate (by delegating yourself), and A0 when the other player **does** delegate.

So by delegating, you are **conditioning your action** on the other player’s choice.

Let’s define:

Let P(2 does not delegate) = 1 - f

Then if you **delegate**, your action is:
- A1 with probability (1 - f): because if 2 does not delegate → only one delegator → A1
- A0 with probability f: because if 2 delegates → both delegate → A0

So if you delegate, your **effective action** is A1 with prob (1−f), A0 with prob f

Therefore, your **expected payoff if you delegate** is:

E(delegate) = (1−f) * [your payoff if you play A1 and 2 plays action] + f * [your payoff if you play A0 and 2 plays action]

But the problem is: **Player 2’s action also depends on their strategy and whether they delegate**.

This is complex because **both players’ actions are dependent on their own strategy**.

But there is an **equilibrium possibility**: suppose that **both players delegate**.

Then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0
- So payoff: 10 for each

But is this stable?

Suppose you unilaterally deviate and play A0 instead of delegating.

Then:
- You play A0
- Player 2 is delegating → so they play A1 (since only one delegator → A1)

Then:
- You: A0, other: A1 → you get 0
- But if you had delegated, you would have gotten 10 (against A0)

So by deviating to A0, you get 0 instead of 10 → so you prefer to delegate.

Similarly, if you deviate to A1: you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4

But 4 < 10 → still worse.

So if both delegate, you get 10 → deviation gets you ≤ 4 or 0 → so better to stick with delegation.

Now, what if you think Player 2 might not delegate?

Suppose Player 2 delegates with probability f.

Then if you delegate:
- With prob (1−f): only you delegate → you play A1, Player 2 plays A0 (because 2 is not delegating, so they choose their own action)
- With prob f: both delegate → you play A0, Player 2 plays A0

But Wait — if Player 2 delegates, they play A0 (since both delegating → mediator plays A0)

If Player 2 **does not** delegate, then they choose their own action: A0, A1, A2 with their probabilities.

So the **actual action of Player 2 when not delegating** depends on their own strategy.

This is getting messy.

But notice: the only **safe** way to get a high payoff is to coordinate on A0.

Because when both play A0, you get 10.

When both play A1, you get 4.

When you play A0 and other A1 → you get 0 → bad.

So the **desired outcome** is both playing A0.

Can delegation help coordinate on A0?

Yes!

Because if **both** delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get A0 → payoff 10 each.

Now, suppose **you** delegate, and **Player 2** is playing a strategy where they **also** delegate with high probability → then you both get A0.

If **only one** delegates → mediator plays A1 → that person gets A1.

So if you delegate and **Player 2 does not delegate**, you play A1, and Player 2 plays some action (from their own strategy).

So your payoff depends on what Player 2 does.

But **here’s a key point**: if you **always delegate**, then your action becomes:

- A1 with prob (1−f) → when Player 2 does not delegate
- A0 with prob f → when Player 2 delegates

Now, **what is Player 2’s incentive to delegate**?

They might also want to coordinate.

Let’s suppose the **Nash equilibrium** is **both players delegate**.

Then:
- You play A0 (because both delegate → mediator A0)
- Player 2 plays A0
- Both get 10

Now, is this stable? Let’s check if either player wants to deviate.

Suppose you deviate to A0 (instead of delegating).

Then:
- You play A0
- Player 2 is delegating → so Player 2 plays A0 (since both delegate? Wait no: you are not delegating now, so only Player 2 delegates → mediator → A1 → so Player 2 plays A1)
- So outcome: you A0, other A1 → you get 0

But if you had delegated, you get 10 → so you get 0 < 10 → worse.

If you deviate to A1: you play A1, other plays A1 → you get 4 < 10 → worse.

So yes: if both are delegating, you're better off delegating.

Similarly for Player 2: if they deviate to A0 and you are delegating, then:
- You: delegating → only one delegator → you play A1
- Player 2: plays A0 → so you get 6? Wait:

Wait: you are playing A1 (because you delegated), Player 2 plays A0

→ You: A1, other: A0 → you get 6

But if you had stayed delegating, you get 10 → 6 < 10 → worse.

So Player 2 also wants to keep delegating.

Therefore, **(both delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium** with payoff 10 for you.

Now, are there other equilibria?

Suppose **no one delegates**.

Then the game reduces to original game.

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium in the original game.

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with prob p, A1 with 1−p

Player 2 plays A0 with prob q, A1 with 1−q

Player 1’s payoff:

E1 = 10pq + 0*p*(1−q) + 6*(1−p)*q + 4*(1−p)(1−q)  
= 10pq + 0 + 6q(1−p) + 4(1−p−q+pq)  
= 10pq + 6q - 6pq + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq  
= (10pq - 6pq + 4pq) + (6q - 4q) + 4 - 4p  
= 8pq + 2q + 4 - 4p

To find best response, take derivative w.r.t. p (treat q as constant):

dE1/dp = 8q - 4

Set derivative = 0 → 8q - 4 = 0 → q = 0.5

So if Player 2 plays q = 0.5 (A0 with 50%), then Player 1 is indifferent to p? No: the derivative is 8q - 4.

So if q > 0.5, dE1/dp > 0 → best to increase p → play A0 more

If q < 0.5, dE1/dp < 0 → best to decrease p → play A1 more

So best response of Player 1:

- If q > 0.5 → p = 1
- If q < 0.5 → p = 0
- If q = 0.5 → any p is best response

Similarly, Player 2’s payoff (from their perspective):

|   | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|---|-------|-------|
| P1 A0 | 10      | 20      |
| P1 A1 | 2       | 4       |

So E2 = 10p q + 20p (1−q) + 2(1−p)q + 4(1−p)(1−q)  
= 10pq + 20p - 20pq + 2q - 2pq + 4(1−p−q+pq)  
= (10pq -20pq -2pq) + 20p + 2q + 4 -4p -4q +4pq  
= (-12pq) + 16p -2q +4 +4pq? Let's recast:

Wait:

After expanding:

10pq + 20p - 20pq + 2q - 2pq + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq  
Combine pq terms: 10 -20 -2 +4 = -8pq  
p terms: 20p - 4p = 16p  
q terms: 2q - 4q = -2q  
constant: 4

So E2 = -8pq + 16p - 2q + 4

Derivative w.r.t. p: -8q + 16

Set to 0: -8q + 16 = 0 → q = 2 → impossible

Wait — that can't be.

Actually, **E2 as function of p and q**.

For best response: fix q, find p.

dE2/dp = -8q + 16

So if q < 2 → always positive? But q ≤ 1

So -8q + 16 ≥ -8 + 16 = 8 > 0 for all q in [0,1]

So dE2/dp > 0 for all q ∈ [0,1]

That means Player 2 always wants to **increase p** → i.e., play A0 more

So best response: p = 1 (always play A0)

But wait: no — E2 is **Player 2’s payoff**, and p is **Player 1’s** strategy.

But E2 depends on p (Player 1’s mix), and we want to fix Player 2’s q and find optimal p for Player 1? No.

Wait — in the best response, we fix Player 2’s q, then find optimal p for Player 1.

But for E2 (Player 2’s payoff), we fix p, find optimal q.

So let’s fix p and compute dE2/dq.

E2 = -8pq + 16p - 2q + 4

Now dE2/dq = -8p - 2

Which is always negative (since p ≥ 0), so E2 decreases in q.

So **Player 2 wants to minimize q**, i.e., play A1 as much as possible, because dE2/dq < 0.

So Player 2’s best response: q = 0 → always play A1.

But then if Player 2 always plays A1, Player 1’s best response?

From Player 1’s perspective, if opponent plays A1 (q=0):

E1 = 10p*0 + 0 + 6*(1−p)*0 + 4*(1−p)*1 → wait no:

Wait, when Player 2 plays A1 (q=0), then:

- If you play A0 → you get 0
- If you play A1 → you get 4

So best to play A1 → E1 = 4

But if Player 1 plays A1, then Player 2’s payoff if they play A1: 4
If Player 2 plays A0: 2
So if Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 prefers A1.

So if Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 plays A1 → both A1 → payoff 4

But if Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 plays A1 → you get 0

So best response is A1.

But if Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 best response is A1 → so (A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium? Let’s check.

(A1,A1): you get 4, other gets 4.

If you deviate to A0: you get 0 → worse

If Player 2 deviates to A0: they get 2 → worse (2 < 4)

So (A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, is (A0,A0) a Nash equilibrium?

You: A0, other: A0 → you get 10

If you deviate to A1: you get 6 < 10 → worse

If other deviates to A1: they get 20 → better → so other wants to deviate

So (A0,A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium because Player 2 gets 20 if they deviate to A1 → so they will deviate.

Similarly, (A0,A1): you get 0, other gets 20

You want to deviate to A1 → get 4 > 0

Other wants A1 → already playing A1 → no incentive

So not equilibrium.

(A1,A0): you get 6, other gets 2

Other prefers A1 (gets 4 > 2) → so will deviate

So only **pure strategy NE** is (A1,A1): payoffs (4,4)

But earlier we found that (both delegate) gives (10,10) and is a Nash equilibrium.

So **(both delegate)** gives higher payoff than (A1,A1), so both players prefer it.

Now, is (both delegate) stable?

We already checked: if either deviates, they get ≤ 6 or 4, which is less than 10 → so yes, stable.

Now, is there any **other** equilibrium?

Suppose only one delegates.

Say you delegate, Player 2 does not.

Then:
- You: A1 (since only you delegate → A1)
- Player 2: chooses their own action

If Player 2 plays A0 → you get 6
If Player 2 plays A1 → you get 4

But Player 2 might do better by also delegating.

Suppose Player 2 is indifferent or wants better payoff.

But if Player 2 delegates, then:
- Both delegate → player 2 plays A0 → and they get 10 (if you also delegate) instead of maybe 4 or 6

So they have incentive to delegate.

Similarly, if you don’t delegate, and Player 2 delegates → then Player 2 plays A1 → you (if you play A0) get 0 → bad for you.

So **mutually beneficial** to both delegate.

Therefore, (both delegate) is the **best** equilibrium.

Now, what if **you** are uncertain? Could you mix?

But since **both delegating is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium** and gives you 10, which is better than anything else (max possible is 10, and only achieved at (A0,A0)), and you can **guarantee** that by delegating, provided the other also delegates.

But you don’t know if they will.

However, **in equilibrium**, they will.

So in a **Nash equilibrium**, you can choose to delegate with probability 100, and Player 2 also delegates with 100.

Is there a mixed strategy that does better?

Suppose you mix between A0 and A2.

But if you play A0 with some prob, A2 with some, and Player 2 is playing A1 or A0, it's risky.

But the best thing is to **coordinate to A0**, and delegation allows that by making both play A0.

Now, what if you **don’t delegate**, and play A0 with some probability?

But if you play A0, and Player 2 plays A1 → you get 0 → bad.

No matter what, you risk getting 0.

But if you delegate, and Player 2 delegates → you get 10.

Even if Player 2 doesn’t delegate, then you get A1 → and if they play A0 → you get 6, if they play A1 → you get 4 → **at least 4**, and possibly 6.

But you **cannot** guarantee 10 unless both delegate.

But in equilibrium, both will **prefer to delegate** to avoid the risk of getting 0.

Moreover, if you **always** delegate, and Player 2 is rational, they will also delegate (because otherwise they get less than 10).

So **the only stable equilibrium** is **both players delegate**.

Thus, for **Player 1**, the optimal strategy is to **always delegate**.

Therefore, set P(A2) = 100.

But let’s confirm the **symmetric equilibrium**: both delegate → both play A0 → get 10.

If you don't delegate, you get at most 6 if they play A0, but they have incentive to play A1, so risk of getting 0.

So delegating protects you against bad outcomes.

Therefore, **you should delegate with 100% probability**.

Now, what about A0 and A1?

You should **never** play A0 or A1 as independent actions, because:

- If you play A0, and Player 2 plays A1 → you get 0 → catastrophic
- If you play A1, you get at most 4 → worse than 10

So the **only way to get 10** is to delegate and both delegate.

And since **delegation is safe and leads to coordination**, you should do it.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is:

- A0: 0%
- A1: 0%
- A2: 100%

But wait — is this really optimal?

Suppose you delegate, and Player 2 **does not** delegate.

Then:
- You: A1 (only one delegator)
- Player 2: plays their own action.

If they play A0 → you get 6
If they play A1 → you get 4

So you get 6 or 4.

But if you had played A0 yourself, and they play A0 → you get 10, but they might not.

But you cannot force it.

But in equilibrium, **you can expect that Player 2 will also delegate**, because it gives them 10, which is better than 4 or 2.

So in equilibrium, Player 2 will delegate.

Hence, you can safely delegate and expect to get A0.

Therefore, **commitment to delegation** is optimal.

So final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

The original game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0         | A0                     | 10          | 10                     |
| A0         | A1                     | 0           | 20                     |
| A1         | A0                     | 6           | 2                      |
| A1         | A1                     | 4           | 4                      |

So, as **Player 1**, we want to maximize our expected payoff.

But now there’s a **twist**: we can **delegate** our move to a **mediator** by choosing **A2** ("Delegate to Mediator"). 

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

The mediator:
- If **only one player** delegates to it → it plays **A1**
- If **two players** delegate to it → it plays **A0**

So:
- If **you delegate (A2)** and the **other player does not delegate**, then **only you delegate**, so mediator plays **A1** → you get the payoff corresponding to (A1, opponent's action)
- If **you delegate AND the other player delegates**, then **both delegate**, so mediator plays **A0**, and you are effectively playing **A0**

Note: The mediator **only acts if someone delegates**. If no one delegates, then both play independently.

The key point: **You can only delegate if the mediator is active**, but the mediator’s behavior **depends on how many players delegate to it**.

---

### **Step 3: Model Possible Scenarios Based on Delegation**

Let’s suppose both players choose a strategy (by choosing probabilities over A0, A1, A2). Since we are Player 1, let:

- $ p_0 $: probability you play A0  
- $ p_1 $: probability you play A1  
- $ p_2 $: probability you play A2 (Delegate)

Similarly, let the other player choose:
- $ q_0 $, $ q_1 $, $ q_2 $ for their actions

But since both players are rational and we’re deciding our own strategy, we need to **find a Nash equilibrium** or at least a **best response** that maximizes our expected payoff, assuming the other player might act optimally or we can anticipate their behavior.

However, since we are only asked to **choose a probability distribution** (as if we’re writing a strategy), and there’s no mention of the other player’s strategy, we must assume we are to pick a **robust strategy** that maximizes our **expected payoff** **given that the other player will play optimally in response**, or possibly **assuming symmetry** (since both players have the same options), or **assuming cautious behavior**.

But here's a thought: **the mediator’s behavior depends on the number of delegators, which is a joint decision.**

We must consider that the **actual action played by us** depends on whether we delegate or not.

Let’s define:

- If we play A0 → we play A0
- If we play A1 → we play A1
- If we play A2 → we **delegate**, so:
  - If the other player delegates → mediator plays A0 (so we play A0)
  - If the other player does **not** delegate → mediator plays A1 (so we play A1)

Thus, delegation **correlates** our action with the other player’s choice.

This is not a standard mixed strategy because the actual action depends on both players’ choice of delegate or not.

We are to choose **our own** probabilities: $ p_0, p_1, p_2 $, with $ p_0 + p_1 + p_2 = 100 $

We want to maximize our **expected payoff**, assuming the other player is also trying to maximize their own payoff — but we are Player 1, so we can consider **symmetric games**, or look for a **fixed point** where both players play the same strategy.

But note: **The mediator is selected via approval voting, and it’s proposed by Player 1** — but that doesn’t change the rules. So it's just a rule we must follow.

Let’s consider possible symmetries.

Suppose both players use the **same strategy**, and we look for a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ = probability you play A0
- $ q $ = probability you play A1
- $ r $ = probability you play A2 = $ 1 - p - q $

But to simplify, maybe test plausible strategies.

---

### **Step 4: Explore the Structure of the Game with Delegation**

Let’s suppose **both players are rational and symmetric**.

Then, we can **guess** that in equilibrium, both players use the **same mixed strategy**, and we can solve for it.

Let’s assume symmetric mixed strategy: each player chooses A0 with prob $ p $, A1 with $ q $, A2 with $ r $, where $ p + q + r = 1 $

Now, for Player 1, the expected payoff depends on:
- The action pair (yours, their action)

But your **effective action** depends on whether you delegated, and whether they delegated.

Let’s consider all 9 combinations of actions, but map them into effective actions.

For Player 1:

| Your Action | Their Action | Your Effective Action | Their Effective Action |
|------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| A0         | A0           | A0                     | A0                     |
| A0         | A1           | A0                     | A1                     |
| A0         | A2           | A0                     | A0 (since only they delegate → mediator plays A1 → they play A1?) Wait, no.

Wait! Let’s carefully define:

> "If 2 players delegate to the mediator, it plays A0. If 1 player delegates, it plays A1."

So:
- If **you delegate (A2)** and **other does not**, then **only 1 delegate** → mediator plays A1 → **you play A1**
- If **you delegate** and **other delegates**, then **2 delegates** → mediator plays A0 → **you play A0**
- If you do **not delegate**, then you play whatever you chose: A0 or A1
- If other does **not delegate**, they play their chosen action

But here’s the catch: **you don’t get to see their choice** — you must choose your own distribution.

So to compute expected payoff, we need to compute over all combinations.

Let’s define:

Let $ r $ = your probability of choosing **A2** (delegate)

Let $ r' $ = opponent’s probability of choosing A2

Let $ p $ = your prob of A0, $ q = 1 - p - r $ for A1

Similarly, opposition: $ p' $, $ q' $, $ r' $

But we assume symmetry: $ p = p' $, $ q = q' $, $ r = r' $

So both players play:
- A0 with prob $ p $
- A1 with prob $ q $
- A2 with prob $ r $, $ p+q+r=1 $

Now compute expected payoff for Player 1.

We need to compute the joint probability of each of the 9 combinations, and compute Player 1's expected points in each case.

---

### **Step 5: Enumerate the 9 Cases (with Effective Actions)**

We consider all combinations of player 1 and player 2 choices.

We define:

- Case 1: You A0, Opp A0
  - You: A0
  - Opp: A0
  - Payoffs: (10, 10)
  - Probability: $ p \cdot p $

- Case 2: You A0, Opp A1
  - You: A0
  - Opp: A1
  - Payoffs: (0, 20)
  - Probability: $ p \cdot q $

- Case 3: You A0, Opp A2
  - You: A0
  - Opp: since they delegated, and **you did not**, so only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so opp plays A1
  - So effective actions: (A0, A1)
  - Payoffs: (0, 20)
  - Probability: $ p \cdot r $

- Case 4: You A1, Opp A0
  - You: A1
  - Opp: A0
  - Payoffs: (6, 2)
  - Probability: $ q \cdot p $

- Case 5: You A1, Opp A1
  - You: A1
  - Opp: A1
  - Payoffs: (4, 4)
  - Probability: $ q \cdot q $

- Case 6: You A1, Opp A2
  - You: A1
  - Opp: they delegated, you did not → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → opp plays A1
  - So (A1, A1) → (4,4)
  - Probability: $ q \cdot r $

- Case 7: You A2, Opp A0
  - You: delegated, they did not → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
  - Opp: A0
  - So effective: (A1, A0) → (6, 2)
  - Probability: $ r \cdot p $

- Case 8: You A2, Opp A1
  - You: delegate → only one delegate (opp didn’t) → you play A1
  - Opp: A1
  - So (A1, A1) → (4,4)
  - Probability: $ r \cdot q $

- Case 9: You A2, Opp A2
  - Both delegate → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → so both play A0
  - So (A0, A0) → (10,10)
  - Probability: $ r \cdot r $

Now sum up Player 1’s expected payoff from all cases:

$$
E = p^2 \cdot 10 +
p q \cdot 0 +
p r \cdot 0 +
q p \cdot 6 +
q^2 \cdot 4 +
q r \cdot 4 +
r p \cdot 6 +
r q \cdot 4 +
r^2 \cdot 10
$$

Simplify:

Group terms:

- $ p^2 \cdot 10 $
- $ p q \cdot 0 + q p \cdot 6 = 6 p q $
- $ p r \cdot 0 + r p \cdot 6 = 6 p r $
- $ q^2 \cdot 4 $
- $ q r \cdot 4 + r q \cdot 4 = 8 q r $
- $ r^2 \cdot 10 $

So total:

$$
E = 10 p^2 + 6 p q + 6 p r + 4 q^2 + 8 q r + 10 r^2
$$

Now, recall $ p + q + r = 1 $, so $ q = 1 - p - r $

Let’s substitute $ q = 1 - p - r $

Now plug into E and try to maximize E with respect to p and r.

But this is a bit messy. Instead, let’s try to **test plausible strategies**.

---

### **Step 6: Try Candidate Strategies**

We suspect that the equilibrium may involve **delegation**, because the mediator can lead to **coordination**.

Let’s try some key strategies:

---

#### **Candidate 1: Never delegate (r=0)**

Then $ q = 1 - p $, $ r = 0 $

Then:

$ E = 10 p^2 + 6 p (1 - p) + 0 + 4 (1 - p)^2 + 0 + 0 $

Compute:

= $ 10 p^2 + 6p - 6p^2 + 4(1 - 2p + p^2) $
= $ (10p^2 - 6p^2) + 6p + 4 - 8p + 4p^2 $
= $ 4p^2 - 2p + 4 + 4p^2 $
Wait:

Wait:
- $ 10p^2 $
- $ +6p(1-p) = 6p - 6p^2 $
- $ +4(1 - 2p + p^2) = 4 - 8p + 4p^2 $

Total:
= $ 10p^2 -6p^2 + 4p^2 + 6p - 8p + 4 $
= $ 8p^2 - 2p + 4 $

Maximize $ 8p^2 - 2p + 4 $? Wait — this is a **quadratic opening upwards**, so minimum at vertex.

Wait — but we want to **maximize** this.

But since coefficient of $ p^2 $ is positive, maximum at endpoints.

Try p=0: E = 0 -0 +4 = 4  
Try p=1: E = 8 -2 +4 = 10

So best is p=1 → always play A0 → E=10

But if both play A0 → (10,10)

But is A0 dominant? Not necessarily.

Suppose you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 10

But if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0 → bad

But if you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get 6 → better than 0

So maybe best response to opponent playing A0 is A1?

Let’s see if (A0, A0) is Nash.

If both play A0: each gets 10

But if you deviate to A1: if opp still A0 → you get 6 < 10 → worse

So yes, (A0,A0) is Nash in pure strategies? But only if both agree.

But if you think opponent plays A1, then you want A0 → get 0, or A1 → get 4 → so better to play A1.

So there may be no dominant strategy.

But in symmetric case, if both play A0, it’s stable against unilateral deviation.

But let’s see other candidate.

---

#### **Candidate 2: Always delegate (r=1)**

Then p=0, q=0, r=1

Then E = 10*(0)^2 + 6*0*0 + 6*0*1 + 4*0^2 + 8*0*1 + 10*(1)^2 = 10

So E = 10

Case: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → (A0,A0) → 10 each.

So if both always delegate → you get 10.

Same as both playing A0.

But is this stable?

Suppose you deviate: instead of delegate, you play A0.

Then:
- You play A0
- Opp plays A2 → so only you (if you don't delegate) → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → opp plays A1

So you play A0, opp plays A1 → you get **0** < 10 → bad.

If you play A1 instead: you get A1, opp plays A1 → (4,4) → you get 4 < 10 → worse.

So **no incentive to deviate** → so **(A2,A2)** is **Nash equilibrium** → both delegate → get 10.

Similarly, (A0,A0) is also Nash: if both play A0, you get 10. Deviate to A1: get 6 < 10 → worse.

So **both** (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) are **Nash equilibria** with payoffs (10,10)

But is there a better equilibrium?

What if players **mix**?

Let’s try to see if we can get **more than 10**?

Wait — maximum possible payoff for Player 1 in any case is 10.

So **10 is the maximum possible**.

So **any strategy that leads to expected payoff > 10 is impossible**.

So **10 is the upper bound**.

So strategies that achieve **10** are **optimal**.

So we just need to pick **any** mixed strategy that leads to expected payoff **10**, or at least **at least 10** — but since 10 is max, only 10 is optimal.

So we can accept any strategy that guarantees 10 expected payoff **in equilibrium**.

But in the above, both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) give 10.

But **(A2,A2)** is only stable if both players **commit to delegate**.

But what if **one player doesn't delegate**?

Let’s check: suppose **you** delegate (A2), and **opponent does not**.

Then: only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1

Opponent plays their action → say they play A0 → then (A1, A0) → you get 6

Or they play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4

Or they play A0 → you get 6

So if the opponent plays A0: you get 6

If opponent plays A1: you get 4

If opponent plays A2: then both delegate → you get 10

So if **you** delegate, and **opponent deviates**, you might get only 4 or 6 — **less than 10**

But in symmetric equilibrium, both want to delegate → so it’s stable only if both trust the other.

But suppose instead we **mix** — and avoid the risk.

Another idea: **What if we play A2 with some probability?**

But let’s suppose the other player is also rational.

We already know (A2,A2) is a Nash equilibrium.

But it is **not robust** — if one player **fears** the other will not delegate, then they might not want to delegate.

But in **equilibrium**, they both believe the other will delegate.

So it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Similarly, (A0,A0) is also an equilibrium.

But now, can we have a **mixed strategy equilibrium** where players **mix**?

Suppose both players randomize.

But since the **maximum payoff is 10**, and **both A0-A0 and A2-A2 give 10**, and any **deviation from these pure strategies risks lower payoffs**, **the best we can do is 10**.

So any strategy that leads to **expected payoff 10 in equilibrium** is optimal.

But our goal is: **choose a probability distribution** that **maximizes expected payoff**.

If we choose a strategy that leads to **10 expected payoff**, it’s optimal.

But what if some randomization causes lower expected payoff in some cases?

So we should pick a strategy that **guarantees 10**, or at least **never falls below 10** — but it’s impossible.

So we must pick a strategy that **leads to 10 in the equilibrium**.

Now, here’s a **better idea**: what if **we delegate with probability 1**?

Then regardless of the other player, **if they also delegate**, we get 10.

But **if they don’t**, we get:
- If they play A0 → you play A1 → (A1, A0) → you get 6
- If they play A1 → you play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 4
- If they play A2 → you both delegate → (A0,A0) → you get 10

So your **expected payoff depends on their strategy**.

If **we assume** the other player plays the same strategy: **delegates with prob 1**, then we get 10.

But if they **don’t**, we get **less**.

But since the game is symmetric, and we want to **maximize our own expected payoff**, assuming **the other player also chooses optimally**, we would **both choose A2**, leading to payoff 10.

But what if we **deviate**? We get less.

So **A2** is a **best response** to the other player playing A2.

Similarly, A0 is best response to A0.

But **which one is better**?

Both give 10.

So both are optimal.

But is there a **strictly better** strategy?

No, since 10 is maximum.

So **any strategy that leads to an equilibrium where expected payoff is 10 is acceptable**.

But we have to pick **one** probability distribution.

Now, here’s a **key insight**: what if we **mix A0 and A2**?

Suppose we play A2 with high probability, but sometimes play A0.

But if opponent plays A2, then:
- If we play A2 → we both delegate → we play A0 → we get 10
- If we play A0 → we both delegate → same outcome → 10

So if they **always play A2**, then **we are indifferent** between A0 and A2.

But now, if they play **something else**, it might be worse.

But suppose they play **randomly**.

But in a symmetric equilibrium, the best is to **play A2 with prob 1**.

Similarly for A0.

But is there a **mixed strategy** where we **do better**?

Let’s suppose we play A0 with prob 1 → get 10 only if they also play A0.

But if they play A1, we get 0 → bad.

Similarly, if we play A2 with prob 1, and they play A1, we get 4 — still less than 10.

So **only if both play A2 or both play A0**, we get 10.

But in a "risk-neutral" world, we want to **maximize expected payoff under symmetry**.

But let’s suppose we **hesitate** to commit to A2 because if the other player doesn’t delegate, we get **only 4 or 6**.

But if we play A0 with high probability, but the other plays A1, we get **0**.

So both extremes are risky.

But **A2 seems more robust**? Let’s see.

Wait — suppose we play **A2**.

Then:
- If opponent is random, we might get:  
  - With prob r: they delegate → both delegate → play A0 → you get 10  
  - With prob 1−r: they don’t → then you play A1 (because only one delegate)  
    - Then your payoff depends on what they play:  
      - If they play A0 → you play A1, they play A0 → you get 6  
      - If they play A1 → you play A1, they play A1 → you get 4

So even if they mostly don’t delegate, you **still get at least 4**, whereas if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

So **delegation is less risky** in the sense that it avoids the 0 payoff.

In particular:

- **If you play A0**, and opponent plays A1 → you get **0**
- **If you play A2**, and opponent plays A1 → you get **4**

So **delegation protects you from the worst-case 0 loss**.

In contrast, if you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you get 0.

But if you play A2, min you can get is 4.

So **delegation is safer**.

Moreover, **if both delegate, you get 10** — same as (A0,A0)

So **delegation gives:**
- 10 if other delegates
- At least 4 if they don’t

Versus:
- 10 if other plays A0
- 0 if other plays A1

So **a clear dominance in worst-case**.

But only if you believe that if they don’t delegate, they might play A1.

But in equilibrium, if **everyone** delegates, you get 10.

So **proposing to always delegate** is attractive.

But is it **optimal**?

Yes — because:
- It guarantees you **avoid the 0 payoff**
- It lets you **coordinate** to (A0,A0) if both commit
- It gives you a **robust** strategy

But what about **mixing**?

Suppose we play A0 with 50%, A2 with 50%

Then:
- With 50% chance: A0 → then if opponent plays A0 → you get 10, if A1 → you get 0
- With 50% chance: A2 → then if opponent plays A2 → you get 10, if A0 → you get 6, if A1 → you get 4

But it’s messy.

But in symmetric equilibrium, we want to **maximize expected payoff**.

Let’s suppose we both play a symmetric strategy: with probability r, play A2; with probability p, play A0; with probability q, play A1.

But earlier we saw that **(A2,A2)** gives E=10.

Now suppose we play a mix.

But since **10 is maximum possible**, **no strategy can do better than 10 in expectation**.

So **we should aim for a strategy that yields 10 in equilibrium**.

But the only way to **guarantee** 10 is to **coordinate** with the other player.

But since we can’t communicate, we must rely on **strategy**.

But here’s a **critical idea**:

**The mediator only acts if players delegate.**

But **if we choose A2**, and the other player does **not** delegate, then we are forced to play A1 (because mediator plays A1 when only one delegates).

So our action becomes **A1** in that case.

Now, compare playing A1 vs A2.

If we **play A1**, we get:
- If opponent A0: 6
- If opponent A1: 4
- If opponent A2: they delegate → we play A1 → so (A1,A1) → 4

But if we play **A2**, and opponent plays A2 → we play A0 → get 10
- But if opponent plays A0 → we play A1 → get 6
- If opponent plays A1 → we play A1 → get 4

So **if opponent plays A2**, we get **10** (if we delegate), vs 4 (if we play A1)

So **delegation is superior if the other might delegate**

But if we believe the other player will **play A0**, then:
- If we play A0: (A0,A0) → 10
- If we play A2: then we play A1 → (A1,A0) → 6

So worse.

So it depends on beliefs.

But since we don’t know, and the **mediator can be a coordination device**, **the best strategy is to commit to delegation** — because it leads to coordination on (A0,A0) if both pick it.

And since **both players have the same interest**, and (A0,A0) is better than other outcomes, they should **both delegate**.

Moreover, **in a symmetric setting**, the **solution** where both delegate to get (A0,A0) is **stable and efficient**.

Also, **A2 is the only action that can lead to coordination**.

Therefore, the **optimal strategy** for a rational player is to **delegate with probability 1** — because:
- It leads to a high payoff if the other cooperates
- It protects against the worst-case (0 payoff)
- It's part of a **Nash equilibrium** (A2,A2)
- It gives the **maximum possible expected payoff** under symmetry

So we should play:

- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

Let’s verify:

If you play A2, opponent plays A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → (A0,A0) → you get 10

If you play A2, opponent plays anything:
- If they play A0: you play A1 → (A1,A0) → 6
- If they play A1: you play A1 → (A1,A1) → 4
- If they play A2: you play A0 → 10

So expected payoff depends on their strategy.

But in **Nash equilibrium**, they also play A2 → so you get 10.

If they deviate, you get **less**, but you have no incentive to deviate.

So it’s stable.

And since **10 is the best possible**, this is **optimal**.

Therefore, the **best strategy** is to **always delegate**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We are in a two-player game where:

- Each player chooses an action: A0 or A1.
- Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) are as follows:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0           | A1           |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**                       | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)       |
| **A1**                       | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

Note: Since you are **Player 2**, the payoffs are **your** points in the first component, and the **other player's** (Player 1) in the second.

So, for example:
- (A0 vs A0): You get 10, Player 1 gets 10.
- (A1 vs A0): You get 20, Player 1 gets 0.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the twist — Delegation to a Mediator**

You now have a third action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

- If you **delegate (A2)**, the mediator plays **for you**.
- The mediator's behavior depends on **how many players delegate to it**:

  - If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
  - If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So:
- If **you delegate alone (only you)** → mediator plays A1 → you effectively play A1.
- If **both players delegate** → mediator plays A0 → you effectively play A0.

Important: You cannot control what the other player does. So delegation introduces uncertainty about what the mediator will do.

Also, **you choose your strategy before knowing what the other player does**.

---

### **Step 3: Determine the strategic implications**

We are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Let’s define your strategy as a probability distribution over A0, A1, A2.

Let:

- $ p_0 $ = probability you play A0
- $ p_1 $ = probability you play A1
- $ p_2 $ = probability you play A2

With $ p_0 + p_1 + p_2 = 100 $

Let $ q $ be the probability that **Player 1** (the other player) chooses A0.

Then $ 1 - q $ is the probability Player 1 chooses A1.

But Player 1 also has the option to delegate (A2), so we need to model **both** players’ choices.

So, let’s consider the full joint strategy space.

But since you are solving for **your optimal strategy**, you must consider that **Player 1 is also rational** and will try to maximize **their own payoff** (independent of you).

So we are looking for a **Nash equilibrium** where your strategy and Player 1’s strategy are best responses to each other.

However, the problem says:

> "Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game"

And you are to choose a **probability distribution over actions A0, A1, A2**.

This suggests we are to find a **best response**, possibly assuming Player 1 is playing optimally, or possibly we need to find the **equilibrium strategy**.

Given that this is a game with a mediator whose behavior depends on delegation, and the only way to use the mediator is to delegate, we need to analyze whether delegation is beneficial.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze outcomes based on delegation decisions**

Let’s consider all possible delegation combinations.

#### Case 1: You delegate (A2), Player 1 delegates (A2)

- Then 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
- Player 1 plays A0
- So outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 10, Player 1 gets 10

#### Case 2: You delegate (A2), Player 1 plays A0

- Only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Player 1 plays A0
- Outcome: (A1, A0) → you get 20, Player 1 gets 0

#### Case 3: You delegate (A2), Player 1 plays A1

- Only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Player 1 plays A1
- Outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4, Player 1 gets 4

#### Case 4: You play A0, Player 1 delegates

- Only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- You play A0
- Outcome: (A0, A1) → you get 2, Player 1 gets 6

#### Case 5: You play A1, Player 1 delegates

- Only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- You play A1
- Outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 4, Player 1 gets 4

#### Case 6: You play A0, Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10

#### Case 7: You play A1, Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20

#### Case 8: You play A0, Player 1 plays A1 → you get 2

#### Case 9: You play A1, Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4

So, for your decision: **when should you delegate?**

Let’s compare scenarios where you **delegate** vs. **do not delegate**.

---

### **Step 5: Compare the value of delegating vs. not delegating**

Suppose **Player 1 is playing a mixed strategy**, and we need to find **your optimal strategy**, assuming Player 1 is also optimizing.

We need to find a **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s consider possible equilibria.

#### **Option: Pure Strategy Equilibrium**

Try: Player 1 plays A0.

Then your best response?

- If you play A0: you get 10
- If you play A1: you get 20
- If you delegate: depends on what Player 1 does.

If Player 1 plays A0 (not delegating), then:

- If you delegate: only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- So you get 20

So you’re better off playing A1 or delegating → both give 20

So you would prefer A1 or A2.

But if Player 1 plays A0, and you play A1 or delegate (and Player 1 not delegating), you both get 20.

Wait — but if both play A1, you get 4.

So only if Player 1 **does not delegate**, and you play A1 or delegate → you get 20.

But now suppose Player 1 considers: If I play A0, you will likely play A1 → I get 0.

So maybe Player 1 wants to avoid that.

But if Player 1 plays A1, you might play A0 or A1.

Let me think in terms of **Player 1’s incentives**.

---

### **Step 6: Identify potential equilibria**

Let’s suppose both players are rational and will react optimally.

Try: **Both players delegate (A2)**

Then:

- 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0
- So outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 10, Player 1 gets 10

Can any player deviate profitably?

- If you deviate to A0: you get 10 → same
- If you deviate to A1: you get 20 → better!
  - Because now: you play A1, Player 1 plays A0 (delegated → A0) → (A1, A0) → you get 20

So **you can deviate and get 20 instead of 10**

So **both delegating is not stable** — you want to deviate to A1.

So **(A2, A2) is not an equilibrium**

Now try: **Neither delegates**

Then both play whatever they choose.

Suppose both play A0: you get 10

But if you deviate to A1 → you get 20 → better

So (A0, A0) unstable

Suppose both play A1 → you get 4

You can deviate to A0: then (A0, A1) → you get 2 → worse

Or to A1 → same → no gain

But if Player 1 plays A1, are they happy?

If you play A1, Player 1 gets 4

If you deviate to A0, Player 1 gets 6 → better

So if you play A0, Player 1 gets 6

But you get only 2

So Player 1 would want to move to A0 if you play A0?

Not necessarily — if you play A0, Player 1 wants to play A0 (gets 10) vs A1 (gets 6)

So if you play A0, Player 1 prefers A0

But if Player 1 plays A0, you prefer A1 → so (A0, A0) unstable.

So no pure strategy equilibrium in pure A0/A1.

Let’s consider mixed strategies without delegation first.

But **delegation is an option**, so we need to include it.

---

### **Step 7: Focus on the effect of delegation**

From above, **if you delegate**, the outcome depends on **how many** others delegate.

Now, here’s a key insight:

- If **you delegate**, and **Player 1 does not delegate**, then:
  - Only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
  - So you get: 20 if Player 1 plays A0, or 4 if Player 1 plays A1

- If **Player 1 delegates**, and you don’t, then:
  - Only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
  - You play whatever you want

So if **you delegate** and **Player 1 **not, you play A1 (via mediator), so you get:
- 20 if Player 1 plays A0
- 4 if Player 1 plays A1

So your expected payoff from delegating (given Player 1 does not delegate) is:
- $ 20 q + 4 (1 - q) = 4 + 16q $

Compare to if you played A1 yourself: same payoff (since both give A1)

Similarly, if Player 1 does delegate, then:
- 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
- So you get: 10 if Player 1 plays A0, or 2 if Player 1 plays A1

But wait — if Player 1 delegates, they play A1 (since only one delegate, but no: mediator plays A1 **if only one delegate**)

Let’s clarify:

- If **1 player delegates**, mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players delegate**, mediator plays **A0**

So:

- If **you delegate and Player 1 does not**, then 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- If **you do not delegate and Player 1 delegates**, then 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- If **both delegate**, 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0

So now consider: **if you delegate, your action is determined by whether Player 1 delegates:**

- If Player 1 **does not delegate**: you play A1
- If Player 1 **delegates**: you play A0

So your **effective action depends on Player 1’s choice**.

Similarly, if you play A0 or A1 directly, it’s under your control.

So **delegation is like an action that gives you A1 if Player 1 doesn’t delegate, and A0 if Player 1 does delegate**.

Now let’s suppose **Player 1 is also rational and will choose a strategy to maximize their payoff**.

---

### **Step 8: Find a Nash equilibrium**

Assume symmetry? Probably not, since the payoffs are asymmetric.

But let's suppose we look for a **symmetric equilibrium**, or at least find one where both players use the same strategy.

But not necessarily symmetric.

Let’s suppose both players are using a **mixed strategy** over A0, A1, A2.

But maybe we can simplify.

Let’s suppose **Player 1 will not delegate**.

Why?

Because if Player 1 delegates, then:
- If you don’t delegate → Player 1 plays A1
- If you do delegate → both delegate → Player 1 plays A0

So if you **do not delegate**, and Player 1 delegates → Player 1 plays A1 → you get 6? No, you get 2 (if you play A0), or 4 (if you play A1)

Let’s suppose we find a **mutual best response**.

Let’s consider a candidate equilibrium:

> **You delegate (A2) with probability 1.**
> Player 1 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with probability 1−q, and does not delegate.

Then:
- If you always delegate, your action is:
  - A1 if Player 1 does **not** delegate → which happens with probability q (assuming Player 1 doesn’t delegate)
  - A0 if Player 1 **does** delegate → but we assumed Player 1 **doesn’t delegate**

So if Player 1 never delegates, then you always play A1.

Then the outcome is:
- You: A1
- Player 1: A0 → you get 20, Player 1 gets 0

Now, could Player 1 deviate?

Player 1’s payoff is 0.

If Player 1 deviates to **delegating**, then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0
- So (A0, A0) → Player 1 gets 10 → better than 0

So Player 1 **wants to deviate**.

So if you always delegate, Player 1 will prefer to delegate (to get 10 instead of 0)

So Player 1 would choose to delegate.

So your **delegation** makes Player 1 want to delegate.

Then both delegate → you play A0

So outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 10

But if you had **not** delegated, you could have played A1 against Player 1 playing A0 → get 20

So if both delegate → you get 10, but you could have gotten 20 if you played A1 and Player 1 played A0.

But **Player 1 is now choosing to delegate** only because they expect to get 10 rather than 0.

Wait — let’s define a **proper equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose **the equilibrium is: both players delegate with probability 1**.

Then as above: both play A0 → you get 10

But if **you deviate to A1**, then:
- You play A1, Player 1 delegates → Player 1 plays A1 → both play A1 → you get 4 → worse than 10

So no incentive to deviate.

But earlier we saw: if **Player 1 delegates and you don’t**, then:

- Player 1 plays A1
- If you play A0, you get 2
- If you play A1, you get 4

So if you play A1, you get 4

But in both delegate, you get 10 from A0

So better to stick with A0

But now, can **Player 1** deviate?

If Player 1 deviates to **not** delegating, and you are still delegating:

- Only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- You play A0
- So outcome: (A0, A1) → you get 2, Player 1 gets 6

Player 1 gets 6, which is less than 10

So Player 1 does **not** want to deviate.

So if you are delegating, Player 1 prefers to **stay delegating** (gets 10) than to defect and get 6.

So **both delegating** is a **best response** for both?

Wait: you get 10, and if you deviate to A1, you get 4 → worse

So you don’t want to deviate.

Player 1 gets 10, if they deviate to not delegating, they get 6 < 10 → so they don’t want to deviate.

So **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**? But earlier we thought you would want to play A1 to get 20.

But **only if Player 1 plays A0**

But in this equilibrium, Player 1 is delegating, so they play A1 only if they delegate and the number of delegates is 1

No! Wait: in (A2, A2), both delegate → 2 delegates → mediator plays A0 → so both players play A0

So Player 1 is playing A0, not A1.

And you play A0.

So if you **deviate** to A1, then:
- You: A1
- Player 1: A0
- So (A1, A0) → you get 20

And Player 1 gets 0

So **you gain 20 → much better than 10**

So **you want to deviate!**

So (A2, A2) is **not** a Nash equilibrium because you can profitably deviate.

But earlier I said Player 1 gets 6 if they deviate, but when **you delegate** and **Player 1 does not delegate**, then:
- Only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1
- You play A0 → outcome (A0, A1) → you get 2, Player 1 gets 6

But **if you deviate to A1**, then:
- You play A1
- Player 1 plays A1
- So (A1, A1) → you get 4, Player 1 gets 4

Worse than 20.

But **in the current equilibrium (both delegate)**, you get 10.

If you **deceive** to A1, you get 20 — that’s better.

So **you can profitably deviate** to A1.

Therefore, **(A2, A2) is not a Nash equilibrium**.

But if you deviate to A1, you get 20, so why would you ever delegate?

Unless Player 1 changes strategy.

Let’s suppose **you delegate with probability p**, and Player 1 also delegates with probability q.

We need to find symmetric or asymmetric equilibria.

But this is complex.

Let’s try a different approach.

### **Key Insight: Delegation is useful only if it prevents Player 1 from playing A0 when you want to get 20**

But if you delegate, and Player 1 plays A0, then you play A1 (if they don’t delegate), so you get 20.

But if Player 1 **does** delegate, you play A0.

So to get 20, you need:
- You delegate
- Player 1 does **not** delegate

But Player 1 may not want to not delegate, because if they play A0, and you play A1, they get 0.

So Player 1 would prefer to avoid that.

Let’s suppose you are considering delegating.

Expected payoff from delegating:

Let q = probability that Player 1 delegates.

Then:
- With probability q: both delegate → you play A0 → your payoff depends on Player 1's action? No.

Wait: if both delegate, mediator plays A0 → you play A0.

Player 1 plays A0.

So you get 10.

- With probability (1 - q): you delegate, Player 1 does not delegate → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1.

Then:
- If Player 1 plays A0: you get 20
- If Player 1 plays A1: you get 4

Let r = probability that Player 1 plays A0 (conditional on not delegating)

But Player 1 may mix between A0 and A1 depending on their beliefs.

This is getting complex.

But notice: **if you delegate, your action is A1 if Player 1 does not delegate, A0 if they do**

So your **effective action** is A1 iff Player 1 does not delegate.

So you are effectively choosing to play a move that mimics A1 when Player 1 is not being aggressive (not delegating), and A0 when they are.

But you want to get 20, which requires (A1, A0)

You get 20 only if:
- You play A1
- Player 1 plays A0

But if you delegate, you play A1 only if Player 1 does not delegate.

So you get 20 only if:
- You delegate
- Player 1 does not delegate
- And Player 1 plays A0 (not A1)

So probability of 20 is:
- P(you delegate) * P(Player 1 does not delegate) * P(Player 1 plays A0 | not delegating)

Let’s suppose Player 1 is rational and wants to maximize their payoff.

Let’s consider a candidate equilibrium: **Player 1 never delegates**, and uses a mixed strategy between A0 and A1.

Then you know that if you delegate, you play A1 (because Player 1 does not delegate), so you get:
- 20 if Player 1 plays A0
- 4 if Player 1 plays A1

So expected payoff from delegating: 20q + 4(1 - q) = 4 + 16q

If you play A1 directly, same payoff.

If you play A0, payoffs: 10 if Player 1 plays A0, 2 if Player 1 plays A1 → 10q + 2(1 - q) = 2 + 8q

Now compare:
- Delegation or A1: 4 + 16q
- A0: 2 + 8q

Difference: (4 + 16q) - (2 + 8q) = 2 + 8q > 0

So for any q > 0, delegation/A1 is better than A0.

So you will never play A0.

Also, delegation and A1 give same outcome, so you might as well play A1 or delegate.

But if you play A1, and Player 1 plays A0, you get 20.

Then Player 1 gets 0.

So Player 1 would prefer not to play A0.

So if you play A1 with high probability, Player 1 will play A1 to avoid getting 0.

So let’s find equilibrium.

Suppose you play A1 with probability p, A0 with 0, A2 with 1-p.

But let’s assume you play A1 with probability 1, no delegation.

Then Player 1 gets:
- If they play A0: you get 20, they get 0
- If they play A1: you get 4, they get 4

So they prefer A1.

So Player 1 plays A1.

Then you get 4.

But if you had played A0, you get 2.

So you get 4.

But if you could have chosen to delegate, and if Player 1 plays A0, you get 20.

But Player 1 won’t play A0 if you play A1.

So to get 20, you need Player 1 to play A0.

So you need to make Player 1 indifferent.

Let’s suppose you play a mixed strategy between A1 and A0.

But earlier we saw that delegation gives you the same as A1 if Player 1 does not delegate.

Let’s assume that **Player 1 will not delegate**.

Then you can either:
- Play A0: get 10q + 2(1-q) = 2 + 8q, where q = P(Player 1 plays A0)
- Play A1: 20q + 4(1-q) = 4 + 16q
- or Delegate: same as A1, since only you delegate

So if you play A1 or delegate, you get 4 + 16q

Player 1 wants to choose q to maximize their payoff given your choice.

But if you play A1, Player 1 gets 0 if they play A0, 4 if they play A1.

So they will play A1.

So q = 0

Then your payoff from A1 is 4

If you play A0, you get 2

So you want to play A1.

But now, if you play A1 with probability 1, Player 1 plays A1.

But what if you **delegate**?

If you delegate, and Player 1 does not delegate, you play A1.

Player 1 gets 0 if they play A0, 4 if A1.

So Player 1 plays A1.

So you get 4.

Same as playing A1.

No difference.

But if Player 1 *were* to play A0, you get 20, but they only do that if you play A0.

So to induce Player 1 to play A0, you must play A0.

But you lose from that.

So the only way to get high payoff is to make Player 1 play A0.

But they only do that if you play A0.

So you are in a chicken game.

Let’s solve for mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Suppose:
- You mix between A0 and A1 with probabilities p0 and p1, p0 + p1 = 1, p2 = 0
- Player 1 mixes between A0 and A1 with probabilities q0, q1, q0 + q1 = 1

Then your expected payoff is:
- A0: 10 q0 + 2 q1 = 10 q0 + 2(1 - q0) = 2 + 8 q0
- A1: 20 q0 + 4(1 - q0) = 4 + 16 q0

You will play A1 if 4 + 16 q0 > 2 + 8 q0 → 2 + 8 q0 > 0, always true.

So you will never play A0.

So p0 = 0, p1 = 1.

Then Player 1's best response: if you play A1, they get 0 if they play A0, 4 if they play A1.

So they play A1.

So q1 = 1, q0 = 0.

Then you get 4.

But can you do better with delegation?

Not if Player 1 is not delegating.

But if you delegate, and Player 1 is not delegating, you play A1, same as playing A1.

So no difference.

But if you could make Player 1 delegate, then both play A0, you get 10.

But they won't delegate because if they delegate, and you play A1, they play A1, and you get 4, they get 4.

If they don't delegate, they play A1, you get 4, they get 4.

Same.

But if you play A0, and they delegate, they play A1, you get 2, they get 6.

So if you play A0, and they delegate, they get 6.

But if you play A1, they get 4.

So they have no incentive to delegate.

So delegation is not beneficial.

But let’s try if you delegate.

Suppose you delegate with probability 1.

Then:
- If Player 1 does not delegate, you play A1
- If Player 1 delegates, you play A0

So your action is:
- A1 with probability (1 - q)
- A0 with probability q

Then your expected payoff is:
- When you play A1 (prob 1-q): you get 20 if Player 1 plays A0, 4 if Player 1 plays A1
- When you play A0 (prob q): you get 10 if Player 1 plays A0, 2 if Player 1 plays A1

But Player 1's strategy is independent.

Let’s assume Player 1 plays A0 with probability q0, A1 with probability 1-q0.

Then your expected payoff is:

E = (1-q) [20 q0 + 4 (1-q0)] + q [10 q0 + 2 (1-q0)]
  = (1-q)(4 + 16 q0) + q (2 + 8 q0)
  = 4(1-q) + 16 q0 (1-q) + 2q + 8 q0 q
  = 4 - 4q + 16 q0 - 16 q0 q + 2q + 8 q0 q
  = 4 -2q + 16 q0 - 8 q0 q

Now, Player 1's best response to your strategy.

But it's complicated.

Assume that both players are symmetric.

Suppose both players use the same strategy: play A0 with probability x, A1 with probability x, A2 with probability 1-2x? Not likely.

After research on similar games, there's a known insight.

### **Breakthrough idea: The mediator is a threat to force A0 when both delegate, but it may be better to play A0 yourself.**

But let’s consider the following: **if you delegate, and Player 1 does not delegate, you get to play A1, and if they do, you play A0.**

So you can be "safe" in the sense that if Player 1 defects, you are not punished.

But the only way to get a high score is if Player 1 plays A0.

So to get 20, you need Player 1 to play A0.

But they only do that if you play A0.

So you want to randomize between A0 and A1 in a way that makes Player 1 indifferent.

But with delegation, you can't directly control it.

### **Final insight: The only way to get more than 10 is to have Player 1 play A0, but that only happens if you play A0. So you are in a chicken game.**

Let's solve the mixed strategy equilibrium without delegation.

You play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1-p

Player 1 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with 1-q

Your expected payoff from A0: 10q + 2(1-q) = 2 + 8q
Your expected payoff from A1: 20q + 4(1-q) = 4 + 16q

You will play A1 if 4 + 16q > 2 + 8q => 2 + 8q > 0 -> always true.

So you will never play A0.

So p = 0.

Then Player 1's best response: if you play A1, they get 0 if A0, 4 if A1, so they play A1.

So q = 0.

Then you get 4.

If you could play A0, you get 2, which is worse.

So you are stuck with 4.

But if you could force Player 1 to play A0, you get 20.

But you can't.

 unless you delegate.

Suppose you delegate with probability 1.

Then you play A1 if Player 1 does not delegate, A0 if they do.

Let Player 1 delegate with probability r.

Then your expected payoff is:

- With probability (1-r): you play A1, Player 1 plays A0 with probability q0, A1 with 1-q0 -> you get 20q0 + 4(1-q0) = 4 + 16q0
- With probability r: you play A0, you get 10q0 + 2(1-q0) = 2 + 8q0

So E[you] = (1-r)(4 + 16q0) + r(2 + 8q0) = 4-4r + 16q0 -16r q0 + 2r + 8r q0 = 4 -2r + 16q0 -8r q0

Player 1's choice: they can delegate or not.

If they don't delegate, they play A0 or A1.

If they do delegate, they play A1 ( since only one delegate) if you don't delegate, but if you delegate, both delegating, they play A0.

So they might delegate to play A0, or not.

But in any case, after careful analysis, the only way to achieve 20 is to have the other player play A0 while you play A1.

Since the only way to get that is if the other player plays A0, and they only do that if you play A0, it's a deadlock.

The best you can do is to play A1, and let the other player play A1, get 4.

Or, if you can make the other player delegate, then you play A0, get 10.

But they won't.

So the highest you can get in equilibrium is 4 or 10.

But let's try one more idea.

Suppose you play A2 (delegate) with high probability.

Then if Player 1 does not delegate, you play A1, and you get 20 if Player 1 plays A0.

But they may not.

But if you delegate, and they delegate, you play A0, get 10.

But if you could get them to delegate, you get 10, which is better than 4.

And they might delegate if it makes them better off.

But in equilibrium, it's likely that we are at a point where the only thing you can do is to choose a mixed strategy.

After extensive analysis, the optimal strategy is to **play A0 with probability 100%**, because if you play A0, and both delegate, you get 10, and if they don't, you might get 2, but you can't do better.

But earlier we saw that you can get 20 if you play A1 and they play A0.

But they won't.

I think the only stable answer is to realize that **delegation is never useful because if you delegate, you are not better off than playing A1 directly when the other doesn't delegate, and when they do, you play A0 and get 10, but you could have played A0 anyway**.

But in the only stable equilibrium we have, both play A1, get 4.

So to maximize, you might as well play A0.

But let's try a different approach.

### **Best known solution for this type of game:**

This is similar to a game where delegation allows you to conditionalize on the other's choice.

In this case, you should delegate to the mediator.

Because if the other player does not delegate, you get A1 (good if they play A0), if they do, you get A0 (not bad).

And you can force them to delegate to avoid you playing A1.

Let's assume that if you delegate, and they do not, you get 20 if they play A0.

They might not play A0, so you risk.

But if you play A0, you get 0 if they play A0, 2 if A1.

So perhaps the best is to delegate.

 after thinking, I recall that in such games, the optimal strategy is to delegate when the other's action is unknown.

But let's calculate.

Suppose you delegate with probability 1.

Then the only way to get 20 is if Player 1 does not delegate and plays A0.

But they may not.

But if you delegate, and they do not, you play A1.

If you play A1 directly, same.

So no difference.

Therefore, delegation does not give you any advantage over playing A1.

So you might as well play A1.

But then you get 4.

But if you play A0, you get at most 10.

So you should play A1.

But with delegation, you can choose not to.

But the only way to get 20 is to have the other player play A0 while you play A1.

Since you can't force them, the maximum you can expect is 4 in the only equilibrium.

But let's try to set a strategy where you delegate with probability 0.5.

But it's complicated.

After all, in the symmetric Nash equilibrium, both players play A1, you get 4.

But if you could play A0, you get 2.

So playing A1 is better.

So your strategy should be to play A1 with 100%.

But then you get 4.

Or, if you play A2, and the other delegate, you get 10.

But they won't.

So no.

The correct answer, after research, is that you should ** delegate with probability 100% ** because it can induce the other player to play A0.

But we saw that if you delegate, and they don't, you play A1, so if they play A0, you get 20, but they might play A1.

But they might want to delegate to force A0.

Let's assume that the other player will delegate if it makes them better off.

In the end, a reasonable strategy is to delegate, because if the other player does not delegate, you get to play A1 and possibly get 20, which is better than anything else.

So I think the best is to delegate.

### **Final decision:**

Based on the analysis, the optimal strategy is to **delegate with probability 100%**, because it allows you to get 20 if the other player plays A0, and you get at least 10 if they delegate, while if you play A1, you get 4.

So the highest expected payoff is from delegation.

I think the answer is to delegate.

So probability of A2 = 100

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's carefully analyze the game step by step, considering both the base game and the **new twist involving delegation to a mediator**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We are in a symmetric 2-player game, but since we're Player 1, we care about our own payoff.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|           | P2 A0   | P2 A1   |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **P1 A0** | (10,10) | (0,20)  |
| **P1 A1** | (6,2)   | (4,4)   |

- If both play A0: (10,10)
- P1 A0, P2 A1: (0,20)
- P1 A1, P2 A0: (6,2)
- Both A1: (4,4)

---

### **Step 2: Understand the delegation option (new action: A2)**

We now have a new action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

The mediator’s behavior depends on **how many players delegate to it**:

- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

So, if **only you delegate**, the mediator plays A1 for you.
If **both players delegate**, the mediator plays A0 for **both** players.

Important: When you delegate, you **don’t choose** A0 or A1 — the mediator does, based on total number of delegators.

---

### **Step 3: Possible joint actions and outcomes**

Let’s analyze what happens in different scenarios, based on which actions are chosen.

Let’s denote:
- You: choose A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)
- Opponent: chooses A0, A1, or A2

We’ll compute the **expected payoff for you** in each case, assuming both players act rationally (or using optimal strategy), but since we want to **maximize our own expected payoff**, we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies involving A0, A1, and A2.

But first, note:
- If both delegate (A2, A2): mediator plays A0 for both → payoff (10,10)
- If you delegate, opponent plays A0: mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate) → you play A1, opponent plays A0 → (6,2)
- If you delegate, opponent plays A1: mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays A1 → (4,4)
- If you delegate, opponent delegates: both play A0 → (10,10) (as above)
- If you don’t delegate (A0 or A1), opponent may delegate → depends on opponent's action.

Let’s now define the payoff **for you** in each possible combination of actions (you vs. opponent):

#### Case 1: You A0, Opponent A0 → (10,10) → you get 10
#### Case 2: You A0, Opponent A1 → (0,20) → you get 0
#### Case 3: You A0, Opponent A2 → opponent delegates → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A0, opponent plays A1 → (0,20) → you get 0
#### Case 4: You A1, Opponent A0 → (6,2) → you get 6
#### Case 5: You A1, Opponent A1 → (4,4) → you get 4
#### Case 6: You A1, Opponent A2 → opponent delegates → only you and opponent delegating? No: you are playing A1 (not delegate), opponent delegates → only **one delegate (opponent)** → mediator plays A1 → so opponent plays A1, you play A1 → (4,4) → you get 4
#### Case 7: You A2, Opponent A0 → you delegate, opponent plays A0 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays A0 → (6,2) → you get 6
#### Case 8: You A2, Opponent A1 → you delegate, opponent plays A1 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays A1 → (4,4) → you get 4
#### Case 9: You A2, Opponent A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → (10,10) → you get 10

Let’s tabulate the payoff **for you** in each combination:

| You \ Opp | A0    | A1    | A2    |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A0**    | 10    | 0     | 0     |
| **A1**    | 6     | 4     | 4     |
| **A2**    | 6     | 4     | 10    |

This table is crucial.

---

### **Step 4: Find optimal strategy**

We now want to find a mixed strategy (probabilities over A0, A1, A2) that maximizes your **expected payoff**, assuming the opponent is also playing optimally (minimizing your expected gain, or playing a best response).

This is a zero-sum game (you want to maximize your payoff, opponent wants to minimize it or maximize theirs — but since payoffs are not symmetric, it's not zero-sum overall, but we can still look for Nash equilibrium).

Since this is a small game (3x3), we can look for a mixed strategy equilibrium.

But notice: **A0 is dominated?** Let’s check.

Compare A0 vs A1 vs A2.

Let’s suppose the opponent plays a mixed strategy. Let’s analyze whether any action is dominated.

But perhaps better: let’s try to find a symmetric or dominant behavior.

Let’s suppose **both players use the same strategy** (symmetric equilibrium), since the game is symmetric in structure (except for player roles, but payoffs are asymmetric).

But note: in this setup, the mediator is **proposed by Player 1** and **selected via approval voting** — but since the other player agreed to the mediator, and we’re in a game, we can assume both players can use the same strategy.

But since the mediator behaves based on **count**, and both players are rational, they might both **want to delegate**, but only if it benefits them.

Let’s examine the table again:

| You \ Opp | A0    | A1    | A2    |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A0**    | 10    | 0     | 0     |
| **A1**    | 6     | 4     | 4     |
| **A2**    | 6     | 4     | 10    |

Now, observe:

- Against A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 6, A2 gives 6 → A0 best
- Against A1: A0 gives 0, A1 gives 4, A2 gives 4 → A1 and A2 better
- Against A2: A0 gives 0, A1 gives 4, A2 gives 10 → A2 best

So no pure strategy dominates all.

But let’s look at **A2 vs A1**:
- A2 gives 10 only if opponent also plays A2
- Otherwise, A2 gives 6 (vs A0 opponent) or 4 (vs A1 opponent)
- A1 gives 4 vs A1, 6 vs A0, 4 vs A2

So A2 is strictly better than A1 **only when opponent plays A2**.

But A0 is good only if opponent plays A0.

Now, crucial observation: **If you play A2 (delegate), and opponent plays A2, you get 10** — better than A0 (10) or A1 (4) against A2?

- A0 vs A2 → you get 0
- A1 vs A2 → you get 4
- A2 vs A2 → you get 10

So **only A2 gives you 10 when opponent delegates**.

So the **incentive to delegate is strong if you expect the other player to delegate** — because then you both get 10.

But **if you delegate and opponent doesn’t**, you get only 6 (if opponent plays A0) or 4 (if opponent plays A1).

But if **opponent plays A0**, you get 0 if you play A0, 6 if you play A1, 6 if you play A2.

So A2 is okay.

What if you play A0 and opponent plays A0 — you get 10. But if you play A2, you get 6.

So A0 is better only if opponent plays A0.

So the **only way to get 10** is:
- Either both play A0, or
- Both play A2

Because:
- (A0, A0) → 10
- (A2, A2) → 10

Other combinations give less.

Now, is **(A2, A2)** a Nash equilibrium?

Let’s check: suppose opponent plays A2. Then:
- You play A0 → you get 0
- You play A1 → you get 4
- You play A2 → you get 10

So best response is A2 → so yes.

Now suppose you play A2. Opponent:
- If they play A0 → they get 10 (from (A2, A0): you get 6, but opponent gets 2? Wait — no, opponent's payoff is not our concern, but we care about their incentive.

Wait — we are maximizing **our** payoff. So for a Nash equilibrium, **we need to check if both players would want to stick to their strategy**, assuming the other does.

Suppose both play A2 → each gets 10.

Now, suppose **you deviate** to A0: you get 0 → worse
to A1: you get 4 → worse
→ so you don’t want to deviate.

Now for **opponent**: suppose they are playing A2. You play A2 → opponent gets 10.

If they deviate:
- to A0: you play A2 → opponent plays A0 → you play A1 → (6,2) → opponent gets 2 < 10 → worse
- to A1: you play A2 → opponent plays A1 → you play A1 → (4,4) → opponent gets 4 < 10 → worse

So **(A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium**.

Is there another?

What about (A0, A0)? Both get 10.

But if you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 10.

If you deviate to A2: you play A2, opponent plays A0 → you get 6 < 10 → not worth it.

Similarly, if opponent plays A0, you:
- A0: 10
- A1: 6
- A2: 6 → so A0 best

So (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But is (A0, A0) stable? Only if both are committed.

But now, suppose both are playing A2 and getting 10.

Same as A0,A0.

But here's the key: **in (A0, A0), if you believe the other player will play A0, you play A0 → good**

But in (A2, A2), you get 10 too.

Now, but is there a **dominant strategy**?

Let’s suppose you want your strategy to be **robust**.

But notice: if **both players expect the other to delegate**, then **both should delegate** — and both get 10.

But if **only one delegates**, they get only 6 or 4.

Wait — **if you delegate and opponent doesn't**, you get:
- If opponent A0 → you get 6 (since mediator plays A1)
- If opponent A1 → you get 4

So you get 6 only if opponent plays A0.

But if you play A1, you get 6 only if opponent plays A0 — same.

So A2 gives **same payoff as A1** when opponent plays A0 — but worse if opponent plays A1.

But A2 can give **10** if opponent also delegates.

So, **delegation is valuable only if you think the other player will delegate too.**

But if the other player plays A0, then delegation gives you only 6 (vs 10 if you play A0), so delegating is **bad**.

So there is a trade-off.

But now, here's a **key insight**:

The mediator’s behavior:
- 1 delegate → plays A1
- 2 delegates → plays A0

So **delegating when you expect the other to delegate** yields A0 for you, which is good.

But **if you delegate alone**, you get A1 — which is not great.

So delegation is **only beneficial if both delegate**.

Thus, the **only way to get a high payoff is to both delegate (get 10)**, or both play A0 (get 10).

But is there a **mixed equilibrium**?

Let’s suppose both players use the **same mixed strategy**, by symmetry.

Let:
- P(A0) = p
- P(A1) = q
- P(A2) = r
with p + q + r = 1

We want to find a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

But since the mediator depends on **number of delegators**, the payoff is not linear in p,q,r individually.

But let’s suppose both players use the same strategy, and we want to find a symmetric equilibrium.

Let’s suppose that in equilibrium, players are indifferent among their strategies, or at least, they don't want to deviate.

But maybe we can try to **guess** a symmetric equilibrium where both players delegate with some probability.

Let’s suppose that **both players randomize only between A2 and A0** — ignore A1? Or not.

Wait — look at the payoff table: A1 is never the best pure strategy.

For example, against any strategy:
- If opponent plays mostly A0, then A0 is best
- If opponent plays A2, then A2 is best
- If opponent plays A1, then A2 or A1 give 4, A0 gives 0

But A1 gives at most 4, while A2 gives 4 or 10.

So **A1 is strictly dominated by A2**?

Compare A1 and A2:
- If opponent plays A0: A1 → 6, A2 → 6 → equal
- If opponent plays A1: A1 → 4, A2 → 4 → equal
- If opponent plays A2: A1 → 4, A2 → 10 → so A2 strictly better

So **A2 weakly dominates A1**, and strictly dominates in one case (when opponent plays A2).

So **no rational player should ever play A1** — it's dominated.

Therefore, in any Nash equilibrium, **A1 is played with probability 0**.

So we can eliminate A1.

Now we only consider A0 and A2.

So the game reduces to:

| You \ Opp | A0    | A2    |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **A0**    | 10    | 0     |
| **A2**    | 6     | 10    |

This is much simpler.

Now, find mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let:
- You play A0 with probability p
- A2 with probability 1 - p

Opponent uses same strategy: A0 with probability q, A2 with probability 1 - q

But in symmetric equilibrium, p = q.

Now, expected payoff for you:

- If you play A0: payoff = q * 10 + (1 - q) * 0 = 10q
- If you play A2: payoff = q * 6 + (1 - q) * 10 = 6q + 10 - 10q = 10 - 4q

In equilibrium, you should be indifferent between A0 and A2 (or at least not want to deviate). If not, then pure strategy would dominate.

Set expected payoffs equal:

10q = 10 - 4q  
10q + 4q = 10  
14q = 10  
q = 10/14 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714

So in symmetric equilibrium, each player plays:
- A0 with probability 5/7
- A2 with probability 2/7

Now, verify: if opponent plays A0 with 5/7, A2 with 2/7, then:

Expected payoff from A0: 10 * (5/7) + 0 * (2/7) = 50/7 ≈ 7.14

From A2: 6 * (5/7) + 10 * (2/7) = 30/7 + 20/7 = 50/7 ≈ 7.14

Equal → indifferent → so best response to play mixed.

So **(p, r) = (5/7, 2/7)** is a symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Now, what about A1? We already argued it's dominated: A2 gives at least as good payoff in all cases, better when opponent plays A2.

So **A1 is not played in equilibrium**.

Thus, optimal strategy for **you** (as Player 1) is:

- A0: 5/7 ≈ 71.43%
- A1: 0%
- A2: 2/7 ≈ 28.57%

But we must output **integers** that sum to 100.

5/7 ≈ 71.42857... → rounds to **71**  
2/7 ≈ 28.5714... → rounds to **29**

But 71 + 29 = 100 → good.

A1 = 0

But is this really optimal?

Wait — **is this symmetric equilibrium the only one?**

We also have pure strategy equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both play A0 → get 10
- (A2, A2): both play A2 → get 10

Are these also equilibria?

Yes, as we checked earlier.

But now, in the symmetric mixed equilibrium, expected payoff is **50/7 ≈ 7.14**

But in pure (A0,A0) or (A2,A2), you get **10**.

So you would prefer **pure strategy**.

But why would you expect the other player to play A2? If they think you’ll play A0, they prefer to play A0 to get 10, not A2 to get 6.

Similarly, if you play A2, opponent gets 2 if they play A0 (since (A2,A0) gives (6,2)), or 4 if they play A1 (but A1 is not good), or 10 if they play A2.

So if opponent expects you to play A2, they prefer to play A2 too.

But the problem is **coordination**.

In symmetric games, multiple equilibria exist.

But here’s the twist: **the mediator was proposed by Player 1**.

So, the structure is that **you are Player 1**, and you control the mediator.

So perhaps **you have an advantage** — you can commit to a strategy.

But the rules say: "You have the option to delegate... You can also choose to act independently."

And the mediator is "proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting".

The key is: **you are the proposer**, so maybe you can **commit** to a strategy.

But in the game, both players act simultaneously.

However, since you are the proposer, and mediation is proposed by you, perhaps you can use **commitment** to make delegation credible.

But the rules don't say you can commit — just that you choose a probability distribution.

So we should assume **simultaneous move**.

But now, in **symmetric equilibria**, the mixed one gives you ~7.14, while pure (A0,A0) or (A2,A2) give 10.

But in (A0,A0), if you play A0, but the opponent thinks you’ll play A2, they might not.

But suppose both players are rational and know this.

Now, **(A2,A2)** is an equilibrium, but so is (A0,A0).

But **(A2,A2) is better than (A0,A0)** only if there are no other incentives.

But let’s suppose **you deviate from (A0,A0)**: if you play A2, you get 0 (since opponent plays A0), but if they play A0, you get 0 from A2, but 10 from A0.

So you won’t deviate — so (A0,A0) is stable.

Similarly, (A2,A2) is stable.

But which one will be played?

This is a **coordination game**.

But now, **you are the proposer** of the mediator.

So perhaps you can **signal** your intention.

But since the game is simultaneous, we can’t use that.

But here’s a crucial point: **if you delegate, and the other player does not, you get only 6 or 4 — less than 10.**

But if you play A0, and the other plays A0, you get 10.

But **the only way to get 10 is if both A0 or both A2**.

But notice: in the **A2,A2** case, you get 10 **without needing to coordinate on A0** — you can both trust the mediator.

But in A0,A0, you have to both choose A0.

But why would you trust that?

But you, as proposer, might want to **induce** the (A2,A2) equilibrium.

But since both are equilibria, and you might want to maximize payoff, but **both give 10**, so same.

But let’s consider **expected payoff under mixed strategy (5/7, 2/7)**: you get 50/7 ≈ 7.14

But if you **play pure A0**, and opponent plays A0, you get 10.

But if opponent plays A1 or A2, you get 0 or 0 → so expected payoff depends on opponent.

But in equilibrium, we assume mutual best responses.

But the problem is: **which equilibrium do we play?**

But here’s a deeper issue: **is (A2,A2) truly better if you can commit**?

But we can't commit in simultaneous move.

But now, **you have an incentive to play a mixed strategy that makes the other player want to play A2**.

But in the symmetric mixed strategy, it's equilibrium.

But perhaps you can do better.

Wait — what if you **play A2 with probability 1** — always delegate.

Then, **if opponent plays A2**, you get 10.

If opponent plays A0, you get 6.

If opponent plays A1, you get 4.

So your expected payoff depends on opponent.

Suppose opponent also plays A2 → you get 10

If opponent plays A0 → you get 6

But opponent: if they play A2, they get 10 (if you play A2)

If they play A0, they get 2 (from (A2,A0): you get 6, they get 2)

If they play A1, they get 4 (from (A2,A1): you get 4, they get 4)

So if you play A2 for sure, opponent’s best response is A2 → because 10 > 4 > 2

So **if you commit to A2, opponent best responds with A2**, and you get 10.

Similarly, if you commit to A0, opponent best responds with A0 → you get 10.

But you **can't commit**, unless you use a mixed strategy.

But in mixed strategy, if you play A0 with high probability, opponent might not want to play A2.

But in the **symmetric mixed equilibrium**, you get only 7.14.

But if you could **commit to A2**, you would get 10.

But the rules say "you choose a probability distribution" — so you **can** play pure A2.

But only if opponent responds with A2 — which they will, as best response.

So **if you play A2**, and opponent plays A2, you both get 10.

But is (A2, A2) an equilibrium? Yes, as we saw.

But if you play A2, opponent wants to play A2.

So **you can safely play A2**, and expected payoff is 10, because opponent will play A2.

Similarly, if you play A0, opponent plays A0 → 10.

But here’s the catch: **you are not forced to play a mixed strategy**.

But if you play **pure A2**, and opponent plays **pure A2**, you get 10.

But what if opponent plays A0? Then you get 6.

But in equilibrium, opponent will not play A0 if they know you play A2 — because their payoff is 2 < 10.

So **in equilibrium, they play A2**.

Similarly, if you play **pure A2**, opponent best response is **pure A2**, so you get 10.

Same as if you play pure A0.

But now, which one should you choose?

But you are the proposer, so maybe you want to **promote delegation**.

But both give same payoff.

But here’s a key: if you play A2, and the opponent also plays A2, you both get 10.

If you play A0, and opponent plays A0, you get 10.

But if you **play A0**, and opponent plays A1, you get 0.

Similarly, if you play A2, and opponent plays A1, you get 4 — still better than 0.

But the **worst-case** is worse for A0.

But in equilibrium, both are fine.

But you want to **maximize your expected payoff**, but assuming **rational opponent**.

So in a rational setting, if you play A2, opponent plays A2 → you get 10.

If you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 10.

So both work.

But is there a reason to prefer one?

But **A1 is dominated**, so not played.

So **pure A2 is a strategy that leads to payoff 10** in equilibrium.

Similarly, pure A0.

But the **mixed strategy** gives only 7.14.

So **pure strategy is better**.

But which pure strategy?

But here’s a subtle point: if you play **pure A2**, you are **not** giving the opponent any choice — they will choose A2 to get 10.

Similarly, if you play A0, they play A0.

But **if you play a mixed strategy**, like 5/7 A0, 2/7 A2, then they might not play A2 with high probability.

But in the symmetric equilibrium, if you play that, they play the same, and you get 7.14 < 10.

So worse.

So you should play **pure A2** to guarantee 10?

But only if opponent plays A2 in response.

And they **do**, because it's best response.

Similarly, if you play pure A0, opponent plays A0.

But now, **is there a conflict**?

No — both are valid.

But **as the proposer**, you might want to **ensure that delegation happens**.

But the **payoff is the same**.

However, **if you play A2, you are delegating** — and the mediator does the work.

But the payoff is the same.

But is there a **doubt**?

Wait — if you play A0, and opponent plays A0, you get 10.

But if you play A2, and opponent plays A2, you get 10.

But in the first case, you **choose** A0.

In the second, you **delegate**.

But your payoff is the same.

So either is fine.

But the **problem is**: if you play A0, and opponent plays A1, you get 0.

But in equilibrium, they don't.

But suppose the opponent believes that if you play A0, they should play A0.

But why would you want to play A0?

Because if you play A0, and opponent plays A0, you get 10.

But if you play A2, and opponent plays A2, you get 10.

So both are valid.

But now, **you can achieve 10 by playing A2 and trusting that opponent will delegate too**.

And since (A2,A2) is a Nash equilibrium, and rational players will play it, you can safely play A2.

Similarly, you could play A0.

But **there is no incentive to deviate**.

But here’s the **key insight**: in the **A2,A2** equilibrium, you get 10, and **the mediator is used**, which is what you proposed.

But the payoff is same.

But is there a reason to prefer A2?

Not for payoff, but perhaps for **simplicity**.

But the question is to **maximize your total points**.

So if you play **pure A2**, and the other player plays **pure A2**, you get 10.

And since A2 is a best response to A2, it's rational.

So it is **safe**.

Similarly, pure A0 is safe.

But the **mixed strategy** is not as good.

So you should play pure A2?

But wait — can you **guarantee** that the other player will play A2?

Only if you play a strategy that makes A2 optimal for them.

But if you play pure A2, then they get:
- A0: 2
- A1: 4
- A2: 10

So A2 is best.

So they will play A2.

So you get 10.

Similarly, if you play pure A0, they get:
- A0: 10
- A1: 20
- A2: 2 (from (A0, A2): you get 0, they get 20? Wait no.

Wait — if you play A0, opponent plays A2 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A0, opponent plays A1 → so payoff: you get 0, opponent gets 20.

So opponent gets 20 if they play A2, while if they play A0, they get 10.

So if you play A0, opponent's best response is **A2**, not A0.

Ah! **This is critical!**

If you play A0, opponent **prefers A2**, because:
- A0: 10
- A1: 20
- A2: 20

So they get 20 from A2 or A1.

But A1 gives you 0, they get 20.

A2 gives you 0, they get 20.

So if you play A0, opponent will play A1 or A2 to get 20.

But you get 0.

So if you play **pure A0**, you get **0** — because opponent will not play A0.

They will play A1 or A2.

So your payoff is 0.

Similarly, if you play A1, opponent: if you play A1, they get:
- A0: 2
- A1: 4
- A2: 4 → so best to play A1 or A2, but payoffs are low.

But they get at most 4.

But if you play A0, they get 20.

So **your best response to opponent playing A0 is A0**, but **opponent will not play A0 if you play A0** — they play A1 or A2.

In fact, if you play A0, opponent's best response is to play A1 or A2 → you get 0.

Similarly, if you play A1, opponent's best response is to play A1 or A2 → you get 4.

If you play A2, opponent's best response is A2 → you get 10.

So the **only** pure strategy that gives you 10 is **A2**.

If you play anything else, you get less.

Therefore, **the only rational pure strategy for you is A2**, because it leads to payoff 10.

The others lead to less.

Therefore, you should play **A2 with probability 100%**.

And then opponent will play A2, you get 10.

If you play A0 or A1, you get 0 or 4.

So indeed, **A2 is the only rational choice for you**.

So final answer:

- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

But earlier we thought (A0,A0) is equilibrium, but if you play A0, opponent will not play A0 — they play A1 or A2 to get higher payoff.

So (A0,A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium because if you play A0, opponent gets 10 from A1 (20) — no.

Wait: if you play A0, and opponent plays A0: you get 10, opponent gets 10.

But if opponent plays A1: you get 0, opponent gets 20 — better.

So opponent **will deviate** to A1 — so (A0,A0) is **not** stable.

Similarly, if you play A0, opponent will not play A0 — they play A1.

So you get 0.

Thus, (A0,A0) is not a Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, for (A2,A2): if you play A2, opponent wants to play A2 to get 10 — but if they play A0, they get only 2; A1: get 4 — both less than 10.

So they have no incentive to deviate.

So (A2,A2) **is** a Nash equilibrium.

And it gives you 10.

Any other strategy gives you less.

Therefore, **you should play A2 with probability 100%**.

So the strategy is:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

This maximizes your expected payoff at 10.

Final answer.

### ✅ Final Answer:
{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}
