Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

To maximize total points in this game, which is a variation of the Prisoner's Dilemma, I need to propose a contract that transforms the payoff matrix into one where cooperation (A0, A0) is the dominant strategy for both players, while ensuring the contract is attractive enough for the other player to approve.

The original payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 10, 10
- (A0, A1): 0, 20
- (A1, A0): 6, 2
- (A1, A1): 4, 4

Currently, A1 is the dominant strategy for Player 2 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). To incentivize Player 2 to choose A0, a contract must penalize A1 or reward A0. By setting a penalty of 11 points for choosing A1, the updated payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 10, 10
- (A0, A1): 0 + 11 = 11, 20 - 11 = 9
- (A1, A0): 6 - 11 = -5, 2 + 11 = 13
- (A1, A1): 4, 4

Under this contract, A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both players, leading to the (A0, A0) outcome of 10 points each. This is mutually beneficial compared to the (A1, A1) Nash equilibrium of 4 points and creates a stable cooperative environment.

response:
To maximize total points in this game as Player 2, we must analyze the payoff matrix and how a contract (additional payments based on actions) can shift the Nash Equilibrium from the sub-optimal (A1, A1) outcome to a more beneficial one.

The original payoff matrix (P1, P2) is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Without a contract, Player 2's dominant strategy is A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1 chooses A1 (4 > 0), leading to the (4, 4) outcome.

A contract specifies extra payoffs $C(A0)$ and $C(A1)$ for actions A0 and A1. The net adjustment for a player choosing A0 while the other chooses A1 is $D = C(A0) - C(A1)$. The adjusted matrix becomes:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (D, 20-D)
- (A1, A0): (6-D, 2+D)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

To maximize Player 2's payoff, we want the equilibrium to be (A0, A1), which yields the highest joint total (20 points). For (A0, A1) to be a Nash Equilibrium:
1.  **Player 1 must prefer A0 over A1 when Player 2 plays A1:** $D > 4$.
2.  **Player 2 must prefer A1 over A0 when Player 1 plays A0:** $20 - D > 10 \Rightarrow D < 10$.

By setting $D$ between 5 and 9, we ensure that (A0, A1) is an equilibrium. Specifically, choosing a lower $D$ increases Player 2's payoff. However, the contract must also be approved by Player 1. Since any $D > 4$ gives Player 1 a payoff greater than their no-contract payoff of 4, a contract where $D=5$ should be acceptable.

If $D=5$, the payoffs at (A0, A1) are (5, 15). To achieve $D=5$, we can set $C(A0) = 5$ and $C(A1) = 0$.

response:
To approach this problem, we must first analyze the game and what each player wants to achieve. The goal is to maximize our total points through strategic decisions and the proposed contract. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

```
           | Other Player (A0) | Other Player (A1)
-----------|-------------------|-------------------
You (A0)   |      10, 10       |      0, 20
You (A1)   |      6, 2         |      4, 4
```

### Step 2: Analyze Player Motivations
- Both players have an incentive to choose A0 because it can provide the maximum points if the other player also chooses A0 (10 points each).
- Choosing A1 is risky but can provide a non-worst-case scenario when the other player chooses A0 (6 for you vs. 2 for the other player).
- When both choose A1, the result is a balanced 4 points each.

### Step 3: Consider Possible Contracts
To encourage cooperation and choosing the mutually beneficial option (A0, A0), we can design a contract that:
1. De-incentivizes choosing A1.
2. Rebalances the risk in such a way that both players are more likely to choose their parts of the equilibrium we want.

### Step 4: Design the Contract
To encourage both players to choose A0, we could propose the following:
- Provide a small positive incentive for both players to choose A0.
- Provide a small deterrent for both players to not choose A1.

A proposition could be:
- +2 points for choosing A0 (encourages safe, mutual cooperation).
- -2 points for choosing A1 (discourages risky, non-cooperative behavior).

### Step 5: Formulate the Contract in JSON format

The contract will look like:

```json
{
  "A0": 2,
  "A1": -2
}
```

This means:
- If both players choose A0, each receives the game payoff (10 points) plus the contract bonus (+2 points): total 12 points.
- If one player chooses A0 and the other chooses A1, the A0 player gets 0 points (base game payoff) + 2 points (contract) = 2 points, and the A1 player gets 20 (base pay) -2 (contract).
- If both choose A1, each gets the game payoff (4 points) minus the contract penalty (-2 points): total 2 points.

### Final Output:
```json
{"A0": 2, "A1": -2}
```

This contract design helps to align the incentives towards a collectively better outcome by encouraging both players to choose A0, aligning with our objective to maximize our total points.

response:
To design an effective contract, the primary objective is to maximize my total points received. To achieve this, the designed contract should provide incentives for both players to act in ways that mutually maximize our payoffs. Let's review the payoffs in detail:

- **If both choose A0:** I get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
- **If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:** I get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- **If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:** I get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
- **If both choose A1:** I get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.

Now, let's analyze the situation from Player 2's perspective:

1. Playing A1 generally yields higher points for me individually (if the other player plays A0), but it is not mutually beneficial unless there is a way to enforce or incentivize this action.
2. Both players choosing A0 results in a sustainable, mutually beneficial outcome, but a slight deviation from this coordinated play by any player reduces overall efficiency of points received.
3. My preference for the other player choosing A0 while I choose A1 yields the highest individual payout for me, but is unfair and unlikely to be agreed upon without a contract altering the payoffs.

Given the above dynamics, a mutually advantageous contract should:

- Prioritize actions where both players receive satisfactory scores.
- Deter strictly non-cooperative strategies.

To summarize, incentivizing both players to choose A0 would maximize mutual payoffs, as each would receive 10 points. The goal is therefore to propose a contract that increases the attractiveness of this outcome while potentially discouraging deviations:

Here's a proposed contract:
- (A0, A0) = Base game results in 10 points each.
- (A1, A0) = Discourage this outcome by penalizing the player who chooses A1 (i.e., me being penalized more than the other player).
- (A0, A1) = Ensure the same level of deterrence to maintain symmetry.
- (A1, A1) = Ensure the split is relatively neutral but with a slight preference to cooperative play.

Thus, the contract could be constructed in such a way that:
If you choose A0: +10 points
If you choose A1: -10 points

This motivates the other player to consider the benefits of cooperation. The final contract terms for Player 2's actions would be:

```json
{"A0": 10, "A1": -10}
```

Explanation:
- Choosing A0 gives an additional incentive of +10 points, making cooperation attractive.
- Choosing A1 adds a -10 point penalty, discouraging the less cooperative strategy.

With this in place, both players tend to avoid the scenario where one defects unilaterally, leaning more towards cooperation for mutual benefit.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s).

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the game structure
As Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
```
                Player 2 (me)
                A0      A1
Player 1  A0    10,10   0,20
          A1    6,2     4,4
```

## Step 2: Analyze without contract
- For me (Player 2): A1 dominates A0 (I get 20>10 when P1 plays A0, and 4>2 when P1 plays A1)
- Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4)
- Optimal outcome: (A0, A0) with payoffs (10, 10) - much better but not achievable without coordination

## Step 3: Contract design goal
I need a contract that:
1. Makes me want to play A0 (reversing my dominant strategy)
2. Leads to the (A0, A0) outcome
3. Is attractive enough for Player 1 to approve

## Step 4: Design mechanism
If I propose {"A0": X, "A1": Y} where X > Y:
- Playing A0 should become dominant for me
- Need: (10+X) ≥ (20+Y) and (2+X) ≥ (4+Y)
- This requires: X - Y ≥ 10

Using negative payments (I pay Player 1), I can penalize myself for playing A1 while taking a smaller payment for A0.

## Step 5: Optimize the contract
With {"A0": 3, "A1": -13}:
- Modified payoffs: (A0,A0) → (7, 13); (A0,A1) → (11, 7); (A1,A0) → (3, 5); (A1,A1) → (17, -9)
- A0 becomes dominant for me (13>7 and 5>-9)
- Given I play A0, Player 1 prefers A0 (7>3)
- Outcome: (A0, A0) with Player 1 getting 7 (better than 4) and me getting 13 (better than 4)
- Both players improve significantly, making approval likely

{"A0": 3, "A1": -13}

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

The payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20) 
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

## Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium without contract

For the other player:
- If I play A0: they get 10 from A0 vs 20 from A1 → prefer A1
- If I play A1: they get 2 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A1

**A1 is a dominant strategy for the other player!**

Given they play A1, my best response is A1 (4 > 0).

Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) = (4, 4)

## Step 3: Design a contract

Since I'm Player 1, my contract specifies payments for my actions:
- Positive value = I receive from other player  
- Negative value = I pay to other player

With contract {"A0": X, "A1": Y}:
- My payoffs become: A0 gives (10+X, 0+X), A1 gives (6+Y, 4+Y)
- Other's payoffs become: A0 gives (10-X, 20-X), A1 gives (2-Y, 4-Y)

## Step 4: Optimize for mutual benefit

I want:
1. To make A0 dominant for me: Need X > Y+4
2. The other player to approve: They must be better off than (4, 4)

If I make A0 dominant for myself, I'll always play A0. Given this, the other player chooses between:
- Playing A0: gets 10-X
- Playing A1: gets 20-X

They'll choose A1 (gets more), resulting in outcome (A0, A1).

For them to approve: 20-X ≥ 4, so X ≤ 16

To maximize my payoff at (A0, A1): I get 0+X, so I want X as large as possible.

But I also want them to approve enthusiastically. 

## Step 5: Propose fair Pareto improvement

Setting X = 10:
- Outcome: (A0, A1) 
- My payoff: 0 + 10 = **10**
- Their payoff: 20 - 10 = **10**

This gives us both 10 points (vs 4 each without contract) - a strong mutual improvement!

{"A0": 10, "A1": 0}

response:
Let’s carefully break down the problem step by step to design an optimal contract that maximizes **your** total expected points, keeping in mind the structure of the game, the payoff matrix, and the added complexity of the contract mechanism.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Normal-Form Game)**

We are Player 1. The other player is Player 2. The payoffs are:

|             | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**  | 10,10  | 0,20   |
| **P1: A1**  | 6,2    | 4,4    |

We'll analyze this game to understand the Nash equilibria, strategic incentives, and how the contract might influence behavior.

---

### **Step 2: Find Pure and Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria**

#### **Check for Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria**

- (A0, A0):  
  - P1: 10; if deviates to A1, gets 6 → no incentive to deviate  
  - P2: 10; if deviates to A1, gets 20 → **incentive to deviate**  
  → Not a Nash eq

- (A0, A1):  
  - P1: 0; if switches to A1, gets 4 → **incentive to deviate**  
  → Not a Nash eq

- (A1, A0):  
  - P1: 6; if switches to A0, gets 10 → **incentive to deviate**  
  → Not a Nash eq

- (A1, A1):  
  - P1: 4; if deviates to A0, gets 0 → no incentive  
  - P2: 4; if deviates to A0, gets 2 → **incentive to deviate**  
  → Not a Nash eq

So, no pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

---

#### **Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**

Let:
- P1 plays A0 with probability **p**
- P2 plays A0 with probability **q**

We find the mixing probabilities where each player is indifferent between their actions.

---

**P1’s Indifference Condition (for P2’s strategy to be optimal):**

P1's expected payoff for A0:
- vs P2's q: 10*q + 0*(1-q) = 10q

P1's expected payoff for A1:
- 6*q + 4*(1-q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4

Set equal for indifference:
```
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5
```

So P2 must play A0 with 0.5 to make P1 indifferent.

---

**P2’s Indifference Condition (for P1’s strategy to be optimal):**

P2’s payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: 10*p + 2*(1-p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2
- If P2 plays A1: 20*p + 4*(1-p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal:
```
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -0.25
```

**Wait, negative probability? Not possible.**

This means there is **no mixed strategy equilibrium where both players mix**, and **P2 cannot be made indifferent** at any p ∈ [0,1], because the equation gives p = -0.25, which is invalid.

So let’s analyze **best responses**.

---

### **Step 3: Best Response Analysis**

Let’s examine P2’s best response to P1’s strategy.

Suppose P1 plays A0 (p=1):
- P2 gets: A0 → 10, A1 → 20 → best response: A1

P1 plays A1 (p=0):
- P2 gets: A0 → 2, A1 → 4 → best response: A1

P1 plays p = 0.5:
- P2’s A0: 10*(0.5) + 2*(0.5) = 5 + 1 = 6
- P2’s A1: 20*(0.5) + 4*(0.5) = 10 + 2 = 12 → prefers A1

In fact, for **any p**, P2 gets:
- A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2
- A1: 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4

Compare:  
16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → 8p > -2 → always true for p ≥ 0

So **P2 always prefers A1 regardless of P1’s action**.

P2’s **strict dominant strategy is A1**.

Now, P1’s best response to P2 playing A1:
- If P1 plays A0: gets 0
- If P1 plays A1: gets 4 → prefers A1

So if P2 plays A1, P1 prefers A1.

So the **unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)** — both play A1, resulting in (4,4).

---

### **Step 4: Implications of the Nash Equilibrium**

In the base game, the only stable outcome is both players choosing A1 → **you get 4 points**.

But is this good? We can do better via the contract.

But note: P2 **always prefers A1**, so unless we can **make A0 more attractive** for P2, they will always play A1.

So we need to **design a contract that makes P2 indifferent or incentivizes them to choose A0**, so that you can get the 10 points payoff (A0 vs A0).

But remember: **only if both players accept the contract**, it takes effect.

Also: **You and the other player each propose a contract**, and then **an approval voting process selects the winner**, with the **contract having the most approvals** chosen **uniformly at random from those tied**.

So, you need to propose a contract that:
1. Is **attractive to the other player** (so they will accept it).
2. Is **designed to exploit the strategic structure** of the game.
3. Maximizes **your expected payoff** in the final outcome.

---

### **Step 5: Strategic Use of the Contract**

You are Player 1. You can propose a contract that changes the effective payoff.

Your contract specifies for each action (A0, A1), how much **extra** you receive (positive) or pay (negative), drawn **from the other player**.

So if you propose:
- A0: +10 → you get +10 if you play A0, and **P2 pays you 10**
- A1: -2 → you pay 2 if you play A1, so P2 gets +2

But importantly: **the contract applies only if both accept it.**

Your goal: **maximize your expected total points (base + contract)**.

Let’s suppose you want to **induce P2 to play A0**.

But right now, P2 **always prefers A1** in the base game.

So you need to **give P2 an incentive to play A0**.

But since **you control only your own payoffs**, the only way to make P2 prefer A0 is to **make your own contract payoffs in a way that changes the effective game**.

Let’s think: **you gain points via the contract only when you play an action.**

So suppose you propose:
- A0: +10
- A1: 0

That means:
- If you play A0, you get +10 more (from P2)
- If you play A1, no extra

But this benefits **you** if you play A0, but says nothing about P2's incentives.

But P2’s **payoff** in the contract is the **opposite** of what you propose — because **you gain, P2 loses, or vice versa**.

So if your contract says:
- A0: +10 → you gain 10, P2 loses 10
- A1: 0 → no effect

Then **if P2 plays A0**, and you play A0, you get +10, P2 loses 10.

But P2 only cares about their **total** payoff: base + contract.

So your contract affects **P2** only through the offsetting payments.

So crucially, when you propose a contract where you gain for an action, **P2 loses that amount** if you play that action.

So the **effective game changes**.

Let’s suppose you want to **incentivize P2 to play A0**.

But P2 will only choose A0 **if their total payoff (base + contract) is higher for A0 than A1**.

Since you choose your contract, you can **adjust your contract to change P2’s incentives**.

But note: you control how **you** are rewarded in each of your actions, which implies **P2 pays you**, so **P2 loses that amount**.

So your proposal shifts the payoff landscape.

Let’s define a contract you propose:
- x = payment to you if you play A0
- y = payment to you if you play A1

Then:
- P2 **loses x** if you play A0
- P2 **loses y** if you play A1

So the effective payoffs become:

|             | P2: A0 (P2 pay x) | P2: A1 (P2 pay y) |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **P1: A0**  | 10, 10 - x       | 0, 20 - y        |
| **P1: A1**  | 6, 2 - x         | 4, 4 - y         |

But **only if both accept the contract**.

Now, P2 chooses their best response based on this **modified game**.

Your goal: **choose x and y** such that:
- P2 is **willing to accept** the contract (i.e., they don’t lose a lot).
- You get as high expected payoff as possible.

But note: **you don't force P2 to play a certain action**, you only influence their incentives via the contract.

Moreover: **P2 may be strategic** — they only accept if **they expect to do at least as well** as in the base game.

But how do they evaluate? They also want to maximize their own payoff.

So let’s suppose you propose a contract.

You want to **induce P2 to play A0**, so that you can play A0 and get 10 (base) + x (contract) → total 10 + x.

But only if they play A0.

But P2 only plays A0 if their **total payoff for A0 ≥ A1**.

So we design the contract so that **P2 prefers A0**.

Let’s suppose you want to set it so that P2 is **indifferent** or strictly prefers A0.

But also, **you have to make P2 accept the contract**, so they must stand to gain or at least not lose compared to not having a contract.

But note: **Without a contract, the game outcomes depend on strategies**.

But since you’re both rational, you’ll end up with the Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → both get 4.

So if P2 can get **more than 4** by accepting the contract, they’ll accept — if the outcome is better.

But we can design a contract where P2 still gets **more than 4**, and you get **much more**, if P2 plays A0.

Wait — but **P2's payoff depends on what action you take**.

So if you propose a contract and P2 accepts, then both players choose actions simultaneously, **based on the new game**, **with the contract's payoffs**.

So you must design the contract so that **in the resulting game, P2's best response is A0**, leading to (A0, A0) — or at least, you can coordinate on a high-payoff outcome.

Let’s suppose you propose:

- A0: +10
- A1: 0

Then effective payoffs:
|             | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**  | 10, 0 (10 - 10) | 0, 20 (20 - 0) |
| **P1: A1**  | 6, 2 - 10 = -8 | 4, 4 - 0 = 4   |

Now check P2’s best response:

- If you play A0: P2 gets 0 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefer A1
- If you play A1: P2 gets -8 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A1

So P2 **still always prefers A1**, even with this contract.

So P2 will still play A1.

Then you play A1, get 4 (base) + 0 = 4 (contract) → total 4.

Same as before.

No benefit.

But what if you **make it worse for P2 if you play A1**?

Suppose you propose:
- A0: +10
- A1: -10

So:
- If you play A0: you get +10, P2 loses 10
- If you play A1: you lose 10, P2 gains 10

Now effective payoffs:

|             | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**  | 10, 10 - 10 = 0 | 0, 20 - (-10)? Wait — **no**!

Clarify: the contract is **additional payment to you**, so negative means **you pay**.

So:
- If you play A1: you pay 10 → P2 receives 10
- So P2’s total payoff increases by 10 if you play A1

So:

|             | P2: A0             | P2: A1 (P2 gains 10) |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **P1: A0**  | 10, (10 - 10) = 0   | 0, (20 - 0) = 20? Wait no

Wait: correction.

When you propose:
- A0: +10 → if you play A0, you get +10 → P2 loses 10
- A1: -10 → if you play A1, you lose 10 → P2 gains 10

So P2’s payoff:
- When you play A0: loses 10
- When you play A1: gains 10

So:

|             | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0      | 10, 10 - 10 = 0 | 0, 20 - 0? No: P2 gains 0 when you play A0 and they play A1 → since you played A0, contract gives P2 0 extra? No

**Important**: The contract only transfers money **based on your action**, not on both.

So:
- If you play A0: P2 loses 10 *regardless* of what they do.
- If you play A1: P2 gains 10 *regardless* of what they do.

So effective payoffs:

|             | P2: A0 (P2 gets -10 if you play A0) | P2: A1 (P2 gets -10 if you play A0) |
|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **P1: A0**  | 10, 10 - 10 = 0                    | 0, 20 - 10 = 10                  |
| **P1: A1**  | 6, 2 + 10 = 12                     | 4, 4 + 10 = 14                   |

Now, P2’s best response:

- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 0 (if A0) vs 10 (if A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 12 (A0) vs 14 (A1) → prefers A1

Still P2 prefers A1.

No improvement.

We need to **tell P2: if you play A0, I will pay you more**.

But you **control only your own payoffs**.

So the only way to make P2 **gain** when they play A0 is to **make your own payoff lower** when they play A0, so P2 gets more.

But that’s not possible — contract only changes **your payoff**, and the money is transferred from P2 to you or vice versa.

So P2’s payoff is **affected negatively** when you play A0, **for the same reason**.

Unless you **design your contract such that P2 gains more when they play A0**, which requires **you to lose less** (or gain more) when they play A0.

But you can’t control that directly.

Wait — **what if you propose a contract that rewards you for A0, but P2 pays you less if they play A0? No, that’s not how it works.**

The contract is **based on your action** only.

So the payment to you (and from you) depends **only on what you do**, not on what they do.

So **P2's payoff from the contract depends only on your action**.

So you can **induce P2 to prefer A0 only if your contract makes their position better when they play A0** — but the only way is if the **earlier base payoff is higher** when they play A0, and your contract doesn’t hurt them too much.

But your contract **hurts P2** when you play A0, benefits them when you play A1.

So to make P2 **want** to play A0, you need to **make them gain when playing A0**, but **that requires your contract to not penalize them** when they play A0 — which is not possible if your contract hurts them when you play A0.

So the key insight:

> **You can't directly reward P2 for playing A0** — you can only reward yourself.

But by **paying yourself when you play A0**, you make P2 pay you, which **hurts P2** — so if you want to induce P2 to play A0, you need to make **your own A0 action less costly** (i.e., you want to get high reward for A0), but that **increases the cost to P2**.

So P2 will **shun A0** because it makes them lose more.

So paradox: **to incentivize A0, you have to make it hurt P2 more** — which makes them avoid it.

So maybe you should **not try to induce A0**, but instead **coordinate on A1**, but make it better for you?

But in (A1, A1), you get only 4.

Can you get more by contract?

Wait — what if you **propose a contract that makes you pay less for A1**, or gain for A1?

But let’s think differently.

### Alternate strategy: Make P2 indifferent between A0 and A1.

Suppose you propose:

- A0: +10
- A1: +6

Then:
- P2 loses 10 if you play A0
- P2 loses 6 if you play A1

Then effective payoffs:

|             | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**  | 10, 10 - 10 = 0 | 0, 20 - 6 = 14 |
| **P1: A1**  | 6, 2 - 10 = -8  | 4, 4 - 6 = -2 |

Now P2’s best response:
- If you play A0: 0 vs 14 → prefers A1
- If you play A1: -8 vs -2 → prefers A1

Still A1.

But suppose you **punish yourself for A1**? That helps P2.

Suppose you propose:
- A0: +10
- A1: -2

So:
- You gain 10 for A0 → P2 loses 10
- You lose 2 for A1 → P2 gains 2

Effective payoffs:

|             | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0      | 10, 0  | 0, 22  |
| P1: A1      | 6, 0   | 4, 6   |

Wait: P2's payoff when you play A1: base + 2 (since P2 gains 2) → so:
- P2: A0: 2 + 2 = 4
- P2: A1: 4 + 2 = 6

So:

|             | P2: A0 (P2 gets +2) | P2: A1 (P2 gets +2) |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **P1: A0**  | 10, 10 - 10 = 0       | 0, 20 - 0? No

Wait: if you play A0, P2 loses 10 → so P2’s payoff = base - 10

If you play A1, P2 gains 2 → so P2’s payoff = base + 2

So:

|             | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**  | 10, 0  | 0, 22  |
| **P1: A1**  | 6, 4  | 4, 6  |

Now check P2’s best response:

- If you play A0: P2 gets 0 (A0) vs 22 (A1) → prefers A1
- If you play A1: P2 gets 4 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefers A1

Still A1.

No progress.

But notice: in all cases, P2 prefers A1.

Why? Because in the base game, A1 dominates for P2.

The only way to make P2 want A0 is to **increase P2’s payoff from A0** relative to A1.

But P2’s payoff from A0 is: base payoff + (contract effect based on your action)

The only way to increase it is to have your action cost less to P2 when they play A0.

But your contract is fixed.

Suppose you propose:
- A0: -5 (you pay 5 if you play A0) → P2 gets +5
- A1: 0

Then, if you play A0, P2 gains 5
If you play A1, P2 gains 0

So P2’s payoff:
- A0: base + 5
- A1: base + 0

So for P2:
- When you play A0: A0! 10+5=15 vs 0+0=0 → prefer A0
- When you play A1: A0: 2+5=7 vs A1: 4+0=4 → prefer A0

So if you play A0, P2 prefers A0
If you play A1, P2 still prefers A0

So **P2 always prefers A0**!

Great! So now P2 will play A0 no matter what you do.

Now you can choose your action.

Your payoffs (base + contract):

- If you play A0: base 10, contract -5 → total 5
- If you play A1: base 6, contract 0 → total 6

So you prefer A1.

So you play A1.

P2 plays A0.

So outcome: (A1, A0)

You get 6 (base) + 0 (contract) = 6

P2 gets 2 (base) + 5 = 7

Net: you get 6, which is **better than 4**!

Can you do better?

Try to make P2 still play A0, but you also get more.

Suppose you propose:

- A0: -10
- A1: -1

Then:
- If you play A0: P2 gains 10
- If you play A1: P2 gains 1

P2’s payoffs:
- A0: base + 10
- A1: base + 1

So:
- If you play A0: A0: 10+10=20 vs A1: 0+1=1 → prefer A0
- If you play A1: A0: 2+10=12 vs A1: 4+1=5 → prefer A0

So P2 always plays A0.

You:
- A0: base 10, contract -10 → 0
- A1: base 6, contract -1 → 5

So you prefer A1, play A1, get 5

Worse than before.

Try:
- A0: -6
- A1: 0

Then P2 gains 6 for A0, 0 for A1

P2:
- If you play A0: A0: 10+6=16, A1: 0+0=0 → A0
- If you play A1: A0: 2+6=8, A1: 4+0=4 → A0

So plays A0.

You:
- A0: 10 -6 = 4
- A1: 6 +0 = 6

So you play A1, get 6

Same as before.

Now try:
- A0: -4
- A1: 0

Then:
- P2: gains 4 when you play A0
- You: A0: 10-4=6, A1:6+0=6 → indifferent

So you might play A1, but if you play A1, P2 plays A0

You get 6

If you could play A0, you'd get 6 too.

So walkaway: you get 6.

Can you get 10?

Only if both play A0.

But if you play A0, P2 gains 4 (if contract says -4), and P2’s payoff from A0 is 10+4=14, from A1 is 0+0=0 → still prefers A0

You get 10 -4 = 6

P2 gets 14

So you get 6.

But you want to **induce autonomous playing of A0 by P2**, then you choose A0 to get 10.

But if you play A0, and P2 plays A0, you get 10 -4 = 6.

So you get 6.

But you could play A0 and get 6, or play A1 and get 6.

No incentives to play A0.

So you need to **make A0 more attractive for you**.

Suppose you propose:
- A0: -0 (you get 0)
- A1: 0

Then P2 gets no extra.

P2’s best response: always A1

You play A1, get 4

Worse.

Or:
- A0: -1
- A1: 0

Then P2 gains 1 when you play A0.

P2 will play A0 if you play A0.

You:
- A0: 10 -1 = 9
- A1: 6 +0 = 6

So you prefer A0.

So if you play A0, P2 plays A0.

Outcome: (A0, A0)

You get 10 (base) -1 (contract) = 9
P2 gets 10 +1 = 11

You get 9! Much better than 4 or 6.

Yes!

Is this possible?

Yes.

Let’s verify:

You propose:
- A0: -1
- A1: 0

So:
- If you play A0: you pay 1 → P2 gains 1
- If you play A1: no extra

Effective payoffs:

|             | P2: A0 (P2 gains 1) | P2: A1 (P2 gains 0) |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **P1: A0**  | 10, 10+1=11         | 0, 20+0=20         |
| **P1: A1**  | 6, 2+1=3            | 4, 4+0=4           |

Wait! P2’s payoff:
- When you play A0: P2 gains 1, so:
  - A0: 10 + 1 = 11
  - A1: 20 + 0 = 20? No: P2 gains 1 only if you play A0.

So if you play A0:
- P2's A0: 10 + 1 = 11
- P2's A1: 20 + 1 = 21

So P2 prefers A1 (21 > 11)

Not good.

Ah! **Mistake!**

The contract is: if you play A0, P2 gains 1 **regardless of what they do**.

So when you play A0, P2's total payoff = base payoff + 1, regardless of their action.

So if you play A0:
- P2's A0: 10 + 1 = 11
- P2's A1: 20 + 1 = 21 → P2 prefers A1

If you play A1: P2 gains 0, so:
- P2's A0: 2 + 0 = 2
- P2's A1: 4 + 0 = 4 → prefers A1

So P2 always prefers A1.

But you want P2 to play A0, so you need to make their A0 payoff higher.

But the only way is to give them more when they play A0.

But you can't.

Unless your action doesn't penalize them when they play A0.

But it does.

The only way to make P2 prefer A0 is to **make their A0 payoff high relative to A1**, but their base payoff for A0 is 10 (when you play A0), and 2 (when you play A1), while for A1 it's 20 or 4.

So that’s fixed.

So you need to make the contract so that when you play A0, P2’s gain is higher.

But as above, you can't make A0 better for P2 by the contract.

Unless you **only reward P2 when you play A0 and they play A0**, but you can't.

The contract is only based on your action, not joint.

So the only way to make P2 want A0 is to make their **A0 payoff better** for them, which requires **your action to be A0**, and then the contract benefits them.

But as above, if you play A0, P2 gains 1, but A1 is still better for P2 (21 > 11).

So unless you make your contract such that when you play A0, P2 gets a lot, but A1 is still worse.

But the base payoff for P2 when you play A0 and they play A1 is 20, which is very high.

So to make A0 better, you'd need to make P2 lose a lot when you play A0 and they play A1.

But you can't control that.

 only way: make your action cost P2 a lot when you play A0 and they play A1.

But you can't.

Perhaps you need to **design the contract so that the only rational outcome is (A0, A0)**.

But with P2's dominant strategy, it's impossible unless you make A1 so bad for them.

But P2 can't be forced to play A0.

 unless you make the contract cost P2 when you play A1.

But you have to sacrifice.

Wait — the only hope is to make P2 prefer A0 when you play A1, or when you play A0.

But in no case can you make P2 prefer A0 over A1 in the base game.

But what if you make your A1 action so costly to you that you never play it?

Then you play A0, and P2, knowing you play A0, would play A0 to get 10, but if they play A1, they get 20, so they still play A1.

No.

 unless you make your game such that if you play A1, P2 gains a lot, but if they play A1, you get more.

I'm stuck.

Wait — let's go back.

After research and thinking, there is a known solution for such games.

### Key Insight: You can't make P2 prefer A0, because A1 always yields higher base payoff for P2.

But you can **make P2 afraid that you will play A0 and force them to pay**.

But if you play A0, and they play A1, they get 20, which is high.

 only way is to make the contract so that if you play A0, P2 gets a huge loss, but then they avoid A0.

But if you play A0, and they play A0, they get 10, which is lower than 20.

So to make A0 better for them, you need to not punish them.

The only way to have P2 play A0 is if you play A0 and P2's payoff from A0 is high, but it's not.

 unless you pay them when they play A0, but you can't.

 Perhaps the best you can do is to coordinate on (A1, A1) with a contract that makes you get more.

In (A1, A1), you get 4.

If you can make it so that you get more in the contract.

For example, propose:

- A0: 0
- A1: 6

Then if you play A1, you get 6 more.

P2 loses 6.

But if you play A0, P2 loses 0.

Effective payoffs:

|             | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0      | 10, 10 | 0, 20 |
| P1: A1      | 6, 2-6= -4 | 4, 4-6= -2 |

P2:
- If you play A0: 10 vs 20 → A1
- If you play A1: -4 vs -2 → A1

Still A1.

You play A1, get 4 +6 = 10

P2 gets -2

So you get 10!

Is this possible?

Contract: you get +6 if you play A1.

So if you play A1, you get 4 (base) +6 (contract) = 10

You play A1, P2 plays A1, so you get 10.

P2 gets 4 -6 = -2

But the contract is only active if both accept.

P2: in base game, they get 4.

Here, they get -2, so they will reject the contract.

So not acceptable.

Unless you can make P2 get at least 4.

So you need to make P2 get at least 4.

Suppose you propose:
- A0: 0
- A1: -2

Then you lose 2 if you play A1.

P2 gains 2.

So if you play A1, you get 4 -2 = 2
P2 gets 4 +2 = 6

P2 before got 4, now gets 6, so they accept.

You get 2, which is worse.

 not good.

Suppose you propose:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0

Then no change. You get 4.

 or:
- A0: 4
- A1: 0

Then if you play A0, you get +4, P2 loses 4.

P2 will not accept because when you play A0, they lose 4, and if they play A1, they get 20, which is high.

So unless you change the incentives.

After all this, the only viable strategy is to design a contract that makes P2 prefer A0, which is impossible under the current rules.

But wait — perhaps you can use the contract to achieve (A0, A0).

Let’s try this:

Propose:
- A0: -10
- A1: 0

Then if you play A0, P2 gains 10
 if you play A1, P2 gains 0

So P2's payoff:
- When you play A0: 10+10=20 (A0) or 20+10=30 (A1) → A1
- When you play A1: 2+0=2 or 4+0=4 → A1

So P2 still A1.

No.

 Final idea: the best you can do is to propose a contract that costs you when you play A1, to pay for P2 to accept.

But you want to get more than 4.

Suppose you propose:
- A0: 6
- A1: 0

Then you get 6 if you play A0.

 P2 loses 6 if you play A0.

If you play A0, P2 gets 10-6=4 if A0, 20-6=14 if A1.

So prefers A1.

You get 10+6=16 if you play A0, but you may not.

But if you play A0, and P2 plays A1, you get 0.

So you will not play A0.

You play A1, get 4+0=4.

No.

After careful analysis, the only way to get more than 4 is to have the contract reward you for A1, but punish you less for A1, and make P2 accept.

But P2 will only accept if their expected payoff is at least 4.

Suppose you propose:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4

Then if you play A1, you get 4+4=8
P2 gets 4-4=0, which is worse than 4.

So they reject.

 propose: A0: 0, A1: -1

You get 4-1=3
P2 gets 4+1=5>4, so they accept.

You get 3.

 Worse.

 so no way to get more than 4 unless you can become A0 with P2.

 but you cannot induce P2 to play A0.

 unless you make A0 and A1 contract such that when you play A1, P2 gains a lot, but then they only gain if you play A1.

I think the only way is to accept the (A1, A1) outcome and make the other player accept a contract that gives you a bonus.

But they won't accept if they lose.

So the best you can do is to make your strategy for A1 worth more.

 after all, the optimal is to simply...

### Final decision:

Given that P2 always plays A1, and in (A1, A1) you get 4, and you have a contract that can only work if P2 accepts.

You can propose a contract that gives you +1 for A1, and 0 for A0.

Then if P2 accepts, you play A1, get 4+1=5.

P2 gets 4-1=3 < 4, so they reject.

 so you can't.

 The only way is to propose a contract that both benefit, or P2 gets at least 4.

So propose something that gives you a bonus and P2 a bonus.

But you can't.

 except if you make it so that when you play A1, P2 gain but you gain.

But you can't.

 ifA0: -0
A1: 0

 then no change.

 or perhaps you can't do better than 4.

But earlier with A0: -1, A1: 0, you can get 6.

 let's try that again.

You propose:
- A0: -1
- A1: 0

Then:
- If you play A0, P2 gains 1
- If you play A1, P2 gains 0

 so P2's payoff:
- If you play A0: A0: 10+1=11, A1: 20+1=21 -> prefers A1
- If you play A1: A0: 2+0=2, A1: 4+0=4 -> prefers A1

 so P2 plays A1.

 you:
- A0: 10-1=9
- A1: 6+0=6

 so you play A1, get 6

 P2: 4

 so P2: before 4, now 4, so they are indifferent.

 so they may accept.

 you get 6.

 better than 4.

 and you have not hurt P2.

 so this is valid.

 in this contract, if P2 plays A1, and you play A1, you get 6, P2 gets 4.

 same as before, but you get 6.

 but you have to check if P2 will accept.

 P2 gets 4, same as before, so they are indifferent.

 so likely to accept.

 in approval voting, might accept.

 so this is good.

 can you do better? propose:
- A0: -2
- A1: 0

 then you get 10-2=8 for A0, 6 for A1, so you might play A0.

 P2: if you play A0, they get 10-2=8 if A0, 20-2=18 if A1 -> prefers A1
 if you play A1, they get 2+0=2, 4+0=4 -> A1

 so you play A1, get 6

 P2 gets 4

 same.

 you don't gain.

 propose:
- A0: -3
- A1: 0

 you get 7 for A0, 6 for A1, so you play A0.

 if you play A0, P2 plays A1 ( because 20-3=17 > 10-3=7)

 you get 0 (base) + (-3) = -3

 worse.

 so better to play A1.

 so if you set A0: -1, A1: 0, you get 6.

 if you set A0: 0, A1: 0, you get 4.

 so -1, 0 is better.

 can you set A1 to something?

 suppose you set A1 to +2, but then you get 6+2=8, P2 gets 4-2=2<4, so they reject.

 not good.

 so the best is:
- A0: -1
- A1: 0

You get 6.

 Or to make P2 accept, if you set A0: 0, A1: 0, P2 gets 4, so accept.

 but you get 4.

 so -1, 0 is better.

 so final answer:

{"A0": -1, "A1": 0}

You get 6, P2 gets 4, so they might accept.

 done.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

response:
Let's walk through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Normal Form)**

We are Player 2, and we're playing a simultaneous-move game with another player (Player 1). The actions are A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (Player 2's payoff in bold):

|           | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (10, 10)     | **2**, 6       |
| **Player 2: A1** | **20**, 0     | 4, 4         |

So:
- If (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- If (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- If (A0, A1): (2, 6)
- If (A1, A1): (4, 4)

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Base Game – Nash Equilibria**

Let’s find Nash equilibria to understand what the game likely converges to without a contract.

**Player 1’s best responses:**
- If Player 2 plays A0: Player 1 gets 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefers A0.
- If Player 2 plays A1: Player 1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1.

**Player 2’s best responses:**
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1.
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1.

So:
- Player 2 **always prefers A1**, regardless of what Player 1 does.
- Player 1 prefers A0 if Player 2 plays A0, A1 if Player 2 plays A1.

This suggests a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s find it.

Let:
- p = probability Player 1 plays A0
- q = probability Player 2 plays A0

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10q + 6(1−q) = 10q + 6 − 6q = 4q + 6
- A1: 0q + 4(1−q) = 4 − 4q

Set equal for indifference:
4q + 6 = 4 − 4q → 8q = −2 → q = −0.25 → invalid

Wait — that can’t be. That suggests no interior equilibrium?

Wait — actually, let’s recheck.

Wait: Player 1 is trying to maximize their payoff.

So we need to find q such that Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

But from above:
- A0 payoff: 10q + 6(1−q) = 4q + 6
- A1 payoff: 0q + 4(1−q) = 4 − 4q

Set equal:
4q + 6 = 4 − 4q → 8q = −2 → q = −0.25 → impossible.

That means Player 1 **never prefers A0** when q > 0. Actually, even at q=0:
- A0 payoff: 6
- A1 payoff: 4 → so A0 is better.

Wait, that contradicts earlier.

Wait — let's double-check the payoff table.

When **Player 2 plays A0**, then:
- Player 1’s payoff if A0: 10
- Player 1’s payoff if A1: 6

So A0 is better.

When **Player 2 plays A1**, then:
- Player 1’s payoff if A0: 0
- Player 1’s payoff if A1: 4

So A1 is better.

So Player 1 wants:
- A0 if Player 2 plays A0
- A1 if Player 2 plays A1

So Player 1’s best response is to **match** Player 2’s action.

Now Player 2’s preferences:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 10 (if A0) or 20 (if A1) → prefers A1
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 2 (A0) or 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So **Player 2 always prefers A1**, no matter what.

So if Player 2 plays A1 (pure), then Player 1 best responds with A1.

So (A1, A1) is a pure Nash equilibrium: (4,4)

Wait — is it?

Check:
- Player 2 plays A1 → Player 1 best responds with A1 → yes.
- Player 1 plays A1 → Player 2 best responds with A1 → yes.

So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

Is there another?

Suppose (A0, A0): (10,10)
- Player 2: if deviates to A1, gets 20 > 10 → so not stable.
So not a NE.

What about (A1, A0): (20, 0)
- Player 1: if deviates to A1, gets 4 > 0 → not stable.

So only pure NE is (A1, A1), payoff (4,4)

Now, are there mixed strategy equilibria?

Let’s suppose Player 2 plays A1 with probability q (so q is probability of A1), so A0 with 1−q.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10(1−q) + 0(q) = 10(1−q)
- A1: 6(1−q) + 4(q) = 6 − 6q + 4q = 6 − 2q

Set equal for indifference:
10(1−q) = 6 − 2q → 10 − 10q = 6 − 2q → 4 = 8q → q = 0.5

So if Player 2 plays A1 with 50%, Player 1 is indifferent.

But Player 2 is **always** better off playing A1 (since even if Player 1 plays A0, A1 gives 20 > 10; if Player 1 plays A1, A1 gives 4 > 2). So Player 2 will **never** play A0 in equilibrium.

So Player 2 plays A1 with probability 1.

Then Player 1 responds with A1.

So the unique **rational outcome** is (A1, A1) → (4,4)

But what if players could cooperate? Then (A0, A0) gives (10,10), which is better for both.

So without coordination, they end up in (A1, A1) – a Pareto-inefficient equilibrium.

### **Step 3: Contract Design Objective**

You are allowed to **propose a contract** — a vector of extra payoffs for A0 and A1.

You and the other player each propose a contract. Then, both of you vote for which contract to accept (or not). The contract with the most votes wins. If tied, it's chosen uniformly at random.

You want to **maximize your expected total points**.

So your contract must:
1. Be **acceptable** to the other player (i.e., they should prefer to accept it, possibly because it makes them better off).
2. Be **likely to win** the approval vote.
3. Maximize your **expected payoff**, considering:
   - Whether the contract is accepted (only if both agree)
   - The impact of the contract on game behavior (via the new payoffs)

Let’s define:
- Contract terms: C0 (extra payoff for A0), C1 (for A1)
- Then the **total payoff** becomes: Original payoff + (C0 or C1 depending on your action)

Note: Contracts are **shared** — you get C_i if you play A_i, and the other player pays you C_i (if C_i > 0), or receives from you (if C_i < 0).

So **your contract changes your own payoffs** and **changes the other player’s payoffs**, because the other player is paying/receiving.

So if I propose a contract with C0 = +5, C1 = 0:
- If I play A0, I get +5
- If I play A1, I get 0
- Player 1 pays me +5 if I play A0, 0 if I play A1.

This affects the game.

---

### **Step 4: Goal: Induce Cooperation**

The current NE is (A1, A1) → (4,4)

You want to **induce (A0, A0)**, which gives (10,10) — both better.

So you need to shift incentives toward (A0, A0).

But in (A0, A0), you get 10, but if you deviate to A1 while opponent plays A0, you get 20 — so **strong temptation to deviate**.

So to make A0 a better choice, you need to **penalize deviation**.

But you can only do so via the contract.

You want (A0, A0) to be **mutually attractive**.

Let’s suppose you **propose a contract** such that:
- If I play A0: I get bonus B
- If I play A1: I get bonus 0

Then my payoffs become:
- (A0, A0): 10 + B
- (A1, A0): 20 + 0 = 20
- (A0, A1): 2 + B
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 = 4

Now, if Player 1 plays A0, **I still get 20 > 10 + B**, so I prefer A1 unless B ≥ 10.

But if B ≥ 10, then I’m indifferent or prefer A0.

But I want to **reduce** my incentive to deviate from A0.

But this is only possible if the contract **penalizes me more for A1** or **reward A0 more**, but it’s symmetric.

Wait: the contract is **applied to both players**, but in a way that affects **their own payoffs**.

But you can't force them to play A0 — you can only change payoffs.

So the idea is: **design a contract that makes both players prefer A0 if the other plays A0**.

Let’s suppose both players propose contracts.

But only **one** contract will be selected — the one with most votes.

So you want to **make your contract attractive to the other player**, and **increase the chance that it wins the vote**, while **maximizing your expected payoff**.

But since you are Player 2, and you propose the contract, you can design the contract to **align incentives**.

Let’s suppose you propose a contract:
- C0 = +6 (for A0)
- C1 = -2 (for A1)

This means:
- If you play A0: you get +6
- If you play A1: you get -2 (so you pay 2 points to the other player)

But the **other player sees**:
- If they play A0: they get +6 (from your contract)
- If they play A1: they get -2 (they pay 2)

So the contract makes A0 more attractive to **both** players **in their own payoffs**.

Let’s see what happens if both players adopt this contract.

Now, your **total payoff** becomes:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 6 = 16
- (A1, A0): 20 + (−2) = 18
- (A0, A1): 2 + 6 = 8
- (A1, A1): 4 + (−2) = 2

Wait — in (A1, A0): you get 20 (original) minus 2 (your action A1 penalty) = 18

But earlier you got 20 without contract — now 18. So you **lose** for deviating? But 18 > 10? And the other player gets +6 (from your A0) — but they played A0.

Wait — the contract is symmetric?

No — the contract is proposed by one player, so **only one player is subject to the contract terms**.

Ah — **crucial point**: **Only your contract affects your own payoffs**, and the **other player’s contract affects their own payoff**.

But in this setup, **each player proposes their own contract**, and the **winning contract** is applied to **both players**.

So if **your contract** is chosen, **both players** receive the same extra payments specified in your contract.

So if you propose C0 = +6, C1 = -2, and your contract wins:
- You get +6 if you play A0, -2 if you play A1
- The other player also gets +6 if they play A0, -2 if they play A1

So the **entire game becomes symmetric**.

That’s key.

So the contract **applies symmetrically** to both players.

So if your contract is accepted and active, **both players receive the same bonus/penalty** for each action.

Therefore, your contract affects **both players’ incentives** identically.

So the contract **can shift equilibria**, and it's symmetric.

So if you propose:
- C0 = x
- C1 = y

Then both players’ payoff becomes:
- (A0, A0): 10 + x
- (A1, A0): 20 + y
- (A0, A1): 2 + x
- (A1, A1): 4 + y

Now, to **induce (A0, A0)** as equilibrium, you need:
- If the other plays A0, you prefer A0 over A1 → 10 + x ≥ 20 + y → x − y ≥ 10
- Similarly for the other player: same condition → symmetric

So x − y ≥ 10

Also, you want (A0, A0) to be the **only** equilibrium or at least a stable one.

But also, **you want the contract to be accepted**.

So both players must **prefer to accept** the contract.

But acceptance is based on **whether the contract improves their expected payoff**, relative to not having a contract.

Wait — no: the game is played **with** the contract only if the contract is accepted.

But the question doesn’t say what happens if **no contract is accepted** — but the contract is **only active if all accept**.

So if **no contract is accepted**, what happens?

The game is played **without any contract** — so base payoffs only.

But if **one player accepts and the other doesn't**, then contract **doesn't activate**.

So the only way a contract works is **if both accept**.

So if **you propose a contract**, and the **other player votes for or against**, then:
- If both accept: contract activates → game played with contract payoffs
- Otherwise: no contract → base payoffs

So **each player decides independently** whether to accept.

But the contract only activates if **all accept**.

So each player’s **decision to accept** depends on whether, **if the contract is accepted**, it improves their **expected payoff** relative to the case if **no contract** is used.

But the **outcome** depends on what both players do.

So the **expected payoff** depends on the contract **and** the beliefs about behavior.

But since both are rational, you assume they will behave optimally given the contract.

So you need to ensure:
1. The contract creates favorable incentives → (A0, A0) is a likely outcome.
2. The contract is mutually acceptable → both believe that, **if the contract is activated**, they get a **higher expected payoff than if no contract is used**.

So let’s design.

You want the contract to make (A0, A0) an equilibrium.

So require x − y ≥ 10

But also, you want to **minimize the cost to yourself** (in expectation).

But you can only **set** x and y.

You also need the other player to **be willing to accept** the contract.

So what is the **other player’s incentive to accept**?

Let’s suppose **no contract**: the game goes to (A1, A1), yielding (4,4). You are Player 2.

So if no contract is accepted, you get 4.

So the other player (Player 1) gets 4.

Now, if your contract is accepted and played optimally, what do they get?

You want them to get **more than 4** in expectation, so they will **prefer** the contract.

Similarly for you.

So let’s suppose your contract makes (A0, A0) the **unique equilibrium**.

So you need:
- For both players: if the other plays A0, you prefer A0 → 10 + x ≥ 20 + y → x − y ≥ 10
- If the other plays A1, you prefer A0 → 2 + x ≥ 4 + y → x − y ≥ 2

But the stronger condition is x − y ≥ 10.

Set x − y = 10 → tight.

Now, if (A0, A0) is equilibrium, and no other, and both players play A0, then both get 10 + x

But if you set x − y = 10, and set y = 0 → x = 10

Then:
- Contract: C0 = +10, C1 = 0

Then:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 = 20
- (A1, A0): 20 + 0 = 20 → so indifferent
- (A0, A1): 2 + 10 = 12
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 = 4

Now, if other player plays A0:
- You get 20 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → indifferent → could play A0

If other plays A1:
- You get 12 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is a best response to A0, and to A1** → so A0 is weakly dominant.

Similarly for the other player.

So if both players play A0, it’s equilibrium.

But if one plays A0 and the other A1, you get 12.

But you can **still** get a Nash equilibrium at (A0, A0)

But now, **is (A0, A0) the only equilibrium**?

No — because if you’re indifferent between A0 and A1 when the other plays A0, then you might still play A1.

But if both are indifferent, they might play A1 — so risk of (A1, A1) still.

But in this case, (A1, A1) gives 4 — worse than 20 — so no incentive.

But at (A0, A0), you’re indifferent between A0 and A1 if opponent plays A0.

So (A0, A0) is NE, but so is (A1, A1) — but (A1, A1) is not because if you play A0, you get 20 > 4.

Wait: If opponent plays A1:
- You get 12 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → so A0 better.

So at (A1, A1): you want to deviate to A0 → not NE.

Similarly, (A0, A0): if opponent plays A0, you get 20 vs 20 → indifferent → can play A1.

But if you play A1 while opponent plays A0, you get 20 → same as before — so no gain.

But now, if opponent plays A0, you get 20 regardless.

So (A0, A0) is NE, and (A0, A1) is not, (A1, A0) is not (because if opponent plays A0, you’re indifferent — but if they play A0, you might play A1 — but that gives 20, same as A0 — so okay).

But no strict incentive to deviate.

But **(A0, A0)** is a weak NE.

And **(A1, A1)** is not NE.

But you could end up with (A1, A0) — but that gives you 20, same as (A0, A0) — but you get same payoff.

But if both are rational and value fairness, or if they coordinate, (A0, A0) is better.

But you can do better.

To **ensure** that A0 is the only equilibrium, you need a **strict incentive** — so set x − y > 10

Try x = 11, y = 0 → x − y = 11 > 10

Then:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 11 = 21
- (A1, A0): 20 + 0 = 20 → so 21 > 20 → strictly better to play A0
- (A0, A1): 2 + 11 = 13
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 = 4

Now, if other plays A0, you prefer A0 (21 > 20)
If other plays A1, you prefer A0 (13 > 4)

So A0 is **strictly dominant** for both.

So (A0, A0) is the **unique equilibrium**.

Best outcome: (21, 21)

Now, **what is the other player’s expected payoff under contract?** → 21

Without contract: they get 4 (from (A1, A1))

So they gain **17 points** → **strong incentive to accept**

What about **you**?

You get 21 > 4 → so you gain 17 → you want it.

So **both players want to accept this contract**.

So in approval voting, **both will accept**, so **contract passes**.

Thus, if you propose:
- C0 = 11
- C1 = 0

Then the contract will **win** (both accept), and the game goes to (A0, A0), you get 21.

Is this optimal?

Can you do better?

Suppose you set C0 = 15, C1 = 0 → x − y = 15 > 10

Then (A0, A0): 10 + 15 = 25

But you still get 25 → better.

But is that possible?

Yes — but wait: you **pay** a cost.

No — the **contract is paid by the other player**.

The contract is a **transfer**.

If you get +15 for A0, the other player **pays you** 15 when you play A0.

But in the symmetric case, **both** players get the same bonus.

So when **you play A0**, you get +15, but **you are paying** nothing — you are receiving from the other player.

But if the **other player plays A0**, you get +15.

But in the contract, **you set the terms**, and both players are bound by them.

But **you are not losing** anything from setting C0 = 15.

However, if you can get more than 21, why not?

But wait — what if you set C0 = 100, C1 = 0?

Then (A0, A0): 10 + 100 = 110

But is that acceptable?

The other player gets +100 when they play A0 → they get 110 if (A0, A0) → they gain 106 → they'll accept.

You gain 106 → you'll accept.

So contract passes.

But then you both get 110?

But wait — **you get 110**, but **the system is not balanced** — where does the money come from?

Ah — **the contract is a transfer between players**, not a creation of money.

But the **payment is not from the game**, it's an **additional** agreement.

So if you set C0 = 100, C1 = 0:
- When you play A0, you get +100
- When the other player plays A0, they **get +100**
- But **you are not paying** — the contract **does not require you to pay anything** — it just specifies what extra you get.

But **who pays whom**?

The problem says:
- If you get a positive number (e.g., +100), you receive that amount from the other player(s), **drawn equally from the other player(s)**.

So if it's a **positive number**, you **gain** that amount **from the other players**.

So in **one player**, you set C0 = +100 → you receive 100 from the other player(s) if you play A0.

But there is only one other player.

So if **you play A0**, you receive **100** from the **other player**.

If **the other player plays A0**, they receive **100** from **you**.

So in **A0, A0**:
- You get: 10 (base) + 100 (contract) → 110
- Other player gets: 10 + 100 (contract) → 110

But:
- You receive 100 from other player
- Other player receives 100 from you

So **net transfer: 100 from you to other player, 100 from other to you** → **zero net transfer** — so **no net cost**, no net benefit.

But the contract **specifies the transfer** per action.

But if **both play A0**, each receives 100 from the other → so net zero.

But each gets +100.

So both get 100 extra → total payoff increases.

But the **sum of payoffs** increases.

But **is this sustainable?**

Yes — the contract is **a side agreement** that defines extra payments.

But **you can propose any numbers**.

But **if you set C0 = 1000**, C1 = 0, then both get 1010 if (A0, A0)

The other player still gains 1000 vs 4 → will accept.

You gain → will accept.

But now, **is there a limit**?

Not from payoff, but from **rationality**.

But they will accept — because they get more.

But wait — **you are maximizing your own payoff**, so you want to **maximize your expected payoff under the contract**.

In this case, if you propose C0 = M, C1 = 0, for any large M, then you get 10 + M if (A0, A0)

And since both players get M, both benefit, so both accept.

So you **could set M = 1,000,000**.

But that seems unreasonable.

But let’s think: **does this work?**

Yes — the contract allows any numbers.

But here's a problem: **the other player is also proposing a contract**.

You each propose one.

Then, the one with **most votes wins**.

So **if you set C0 = 1,000,000, C1 = 0**, then:
- You get +1,000,000 if A0
- Other player gets +1,000,000 if A0

But the **other player can propose a contract** that is **more attractive to them**.

For example, they might propose C0 = 0, C1 = 1,000,000 (if they play A1, they get +1M)

But then, if they play A1, they get 20 + 1M → huge

But if you play A0, you get 10 + 0 = 10, but they get 10 + 1M

But if **both propose**, the contract with most support wins.

Now, if **you** propose a contract that gives **you a lot** when you play A0, but **they** get a lot when they play A1 — then **each player might prefer their own contract**.

But **only one contract can win**.

So if **your contract** gives **you** a high reward for A0, but **the other player has little incentive to accept** — no, the **other player gets 1M** when they play A0 — so they **like** your contract? Not necessarily.

Wait — if you propose C0 = 1M, C1 = 0, then when the other player plays A0, they get +1M → they gain a lot.

So they **want the contract to be accepted**.

Similarly, if they propose C0 = 0, C1 = 1M, then if you play A1, you get +1M — but if you play A0, you get 10 → so you get little.

But in that case, **you** might not accept — because you get only 10 if A0, but 20 (base) + 1M if A1 → so you might still want to play A1.

But the **other player** might **vote for your contract**, because it gives them +1M if they play A0.

So in **approval voting**, each player votes for the contract that is **best for them**.

So for **you**, you have two options:
- Vote for your own contract (C0=1M, C1=0): you get 1M if A0, 0 if A1
- Vote for their contract (C0=0, C1=1M): you get 0 if A0, 1M if A1

So you prefer your contract if you are likely to play A0.

But if both contracts are on the table, and you are rational, you will vote for the one that gives you **highest expected payoff** if it wins.

But **you don't know which will win**.

But **you** want your contract to win.

But **the other player** will vote for the contract that gives them **highest expected payoff**.

So if **you** propose C0=1M, C1=0:
- The other player gets +1M if they play A0 → they strongly prefer this contract.
- So they will vote for it.

Now, if **they** propose C0=0, C1=1M:
- You get +1M if you play A1 → so you prefer this contract.

So you will vote for **their** contract.

Thus:
- You vote for their contract (better for you)
- They vote for **yours** (better for them)

So each contract gets one vote.

Tie.

Then it is **selected uniformly at random**.

So with **50% chance**, your contract wins → you get 1M if (A0, A0) → you get 10 + 1M, but if (A1, A1) you get 4

But **your contract makes A0 dominant** → so game goes to (A0, A0)

Similarly for their contract.

So if your contract wins: you get 1M + 10
If their contract wins: you get 20 + 1M (because you play A1)

So your **expected payoff** is:
0.5 * (10 + 1M) + 0.5 * (20 + 1M) = 0.5*(30) + 1M = 15 + 1M

Which is **huge**.

But you only get **15 + 1M** — but you **don't control** the outcome.

But **your proposal** is to set your contract to C0=1M, C1=0.

But since it's likely to **tie**, and you get 1M in expectation, but not certainty.

But you could do better by setting the **contract to make your action dominate**, and **make the other player willing to accept**.

But in this case, if you set your contract to **C0=10**, C1=0, then:
- Other player gets +10 if A0 → gains 10 (from 4 to 20) → will accept
- You get 20 → gain 16 → will accept
- So both accept → contract wins
- Game goes to (A0, A0) → you get 20

No risk.

But if you set C0=1M, you get expected payoff 15 + 1M → **more** than 20.

But 15 + 1M > 20 for M > 5

So it’s **better**.

But is this valid?

Yes — but **you are not required to design the contract to be self-financing**.

The contract just defines transfers.

But **there's no bound**.

But wait — the other player will also design a contract.

But in the approval voting, each player can only vote for one.

But in the scenario above, you propose high C0, they propose high C1.

Then:
- You vote for their contract (because it gives you +1M if A1 → you play A1 → get 20 +1M)
- They vote for your contract (because it gives them +1M if A0 → they play A0 → get 20 +1M)

So tie → 50% chance of each contract.

Then your expected payoff:
- With 0.5: your contract active → you get 10 +1M
- With 0.5: their contract active → you get 20 +1M
- Total: 15 + 1M

But if you set C0=1M, C1=0, and it wins, you get 10 +1M

But **you can only get 15 +1M in expectation**

But if you instead set your contract to C0=10, C1=0:
- Both accept (both gain)
- Contract wins
- You get 20

20 is much less than 15 +1M for large M.

So you prefer to **over-incentivize** your action in your own contract, even if it means risk.

But you can **maximize M** arbitrarily?

But there's a **practical limit** — but the problem doesn't restrict the values.

But **is there a problem**?

Another issue: if you set your contract to C0=1M, C1=0, then the **other player gains a lot from accepting** — but they might **propose a contract that benefits them more**, like C0=0, C1=1000000.

But then, in approval, they will vote for your contract, you for theirs.

But your **expected payoff** is higher if M is large.

But **you are not the only one** proposing.

But you can **assume that the other player is rational**.

So your goal is to **design your contract** to **maximize your expected payoff**, considering that both contracts are proposed, and the winning contract is chosen by approval.

But the other player will also propose a contract.

So you need to **anticipate their behavior**.

But this is getting complex.

Alternatively, can you **design a contract that ensures both players accept it**?

Yes — by **giving them positive gains**.

For example, set C0=10, C1=0.

Then:
- If both play A0: you get 20, other gets 20
- Without contract: they get 4, you get 4
- So both gain 16 → both will accept.
- So contract wins for sure.

You get 20.

But is there a way to get more?

Suppose you set C0=15, C1= -5

Then:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 15 = 25
- (A1, A0): 20 + (-5) = 15
- (A0, A1): 2 + 15 = 17
- (A1, A1): 4 + (-5) = -1

Now A0 is dominant: 25 > 15 and 17 > -1

So (A0, A0) is unique equilibrium.

You get 25.

Other player gets 25.

They gain 21 → will accept.

You gain 21 → will accept.

So contract wins.

You get 25.

Better than 20.

Can you go higher?

Set C0=100, C1=-90

Then at (A0, A0): 110
At (A1, A0): 20 - 90 = -70
At (A0, A1): 2 + 100 = 102
At (A1, A1): 4 - 90 = -86

A0 is dominant.

You get 110.

Other player gets 110.

Gain 106.

Both accept.

Contract wins.

You get 110.

Can you set C0=1000, C1=-990?

Then (A0, A0): 1010

Other player gets 1010 → gain 1006 → they accept.

You get 1010 → gain 1006 → you accept.

Winner.

So you can make your own gain **arbitrarily large**, as long as the other player also gains.

And since the sum of bonuses is not required to be zero, you can set:
- C0 = M
- C1 = -999

Then (A0, A0): 10 + M
 (A1, A0): 20 - 999 = -979
 etc.

A0 is dominant.

Other player gets M when A0.

You get M when A0.

So both gain M - 4.

Both accept.

So you can make M arbitrarily large.

This can't be.

But the problem must have a bounded solution.

Wait — the contract is not for the player to set their own bonus, but to set how much they receive, and it comes from the other player.

But when you set C0 = M, C1 = -N, then:
- If you play A0, you receive M
- If you play A1, you pay N

But the other player:
- If they play A0, they receive M
- If they play A1, they pay N

So if both play A0, transfers are: you receive M from them, they receive M from you → net zero.

But both get M extra.

The system has to allow it.

But in theory, there's no upper bound.

But that can't be the intent.

Perhaps the contract is not a transfer between players, but an external source?

No, the problem says: "drawn equally from the other player(s)"

So it is a transfer.

But in the symmetric case, when both play A0, each receives from the other, so net zero.

So the contract is **funded by the other player's payment**.

But there is no issue.

However, to maximize your expected payoff, you should set the contract to make A0 dominant and give you a very large bonus.

But to get the contract accepted, you need the other player to gain.

So set:
- C0 = M
- C1 = - (M - 4)  # so they gain M - 4

Then other player's payoff in (A0, A0): 10 + M
Without contract: 4

Gain: 6 + M > 4 for M > -2

So yes.

But as M increases, their gain increases.

So they will accept.

You get 10 + M

So you should set M as large as possible.

But there's no bound.

This suggests the problem is ill-posed.

But likely, the intention is to design a contract that is **fair and practical**.

Or to **induce cooperation**.

Most reasonable way is to **make (A0, A0) the only equilibrium**, with a small cost to deviation.

But to max the gain, and ensure acceptance, a moderate solution is better.

Perhaps the intended solution is to set the contract to make A0 strictly dominant with small penalties.

But from above, the best is to set a large bonus for A0 and a large penalty for A1, but only if you can get it accepted.

But since both players benefit, you can go high.

But perhaps the game assumes that players will not accept contracts that are too extreme, but no such thing is said.

Given that, and the need to provide a specific answer, the safest and most reasonable contract is to ensure (A0, A0) is the only equilibrium with minimum cost.

So set:
- C0 = 11
- C1 = 0

Then you get 21.

Or C0 = 10, C1 = 0 -> 20.

But to make it clear that you are not at risk, set the minimum to make it strict dominant.

So I think the intended answer is:

{"A0": 10, "A1": 0}

But wait — with C0=10, C1=0:
- (A0, A0): 20
- (A1, A0): 20 -> indifferent

 not strict.

So to ensure strict dominance, C0=11, C1=0.

And both players gain 11 over 4.

So they accept.

So I think:

{"A0": 11, "A1": 0}

is safe.

Or to make it symmetric and strong, {"A0": 10, "A1": -5} but then you have to pay for A1.

But with C0=11, C1=0, you only get bonus for A0, no cost.

So better.

Final decision: to ensure (A0, A0) is unique equilibrium and maximally safe, set the bonus for A0 to 11.

So the answer is:

{"A0": 11, "A1": 0}

response:
To determine which contracts to approve, we need to evaluate the impact of each contract on our potential payoff. By evaluating the game and the proposed contracts, we can make an informed decision.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Base Payoffs Without Contracts:
- If both choose A0: You get 10 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 20 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 2 points.
- If both choose A1: You get 4 points.

#### Contract Proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0: No additional payment.
- If a player chooses A1: Pay an additional 11 points, distributed equally.

Let's analyze the expected payoff under this contract:
- You and the other player both choose A0: You get 10 points.
- You choose A1, other chooses A0: You get 20 - 11 = 9 points.
- You choose A0, other chooses A1: You get 2 + 5.5 = 7.5 points.
- Both choose A1: You 4 - 11/2 = -1.5 points.

#### Contract Proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0: Receive an additional 10 points, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1: Pay an additional 10 points, distributed equally.

Let's analyze the expected payoff under this contract:
- You and the other choose A0: You get 10 + 5 = 15 points.
- You choose A1, other chooses A0: You get 20 - 10 = 10 points.
- You choose A0, other chooses A1: You get 2 + 10 = 12 points.
- Both choose A1: You get 4 - 10/2 = -1 point.

#### Decision Making:

Let's compare the two contracts to see which is more beneficial for us:

##### Without Contract Comparison:
- Expected dominant strategy is uncertain without further assumptions.

##### With Contract:
- Contract 1 by Player 1:
  - You and other A0: 10 points.
  - You A1, other A0: 9 points.
  - You A0, other A1: 7.5 points.
  - Both choose A1: -1.5 points.

- Contract 2 by Player 2:
  - You and other A0: 15 points.
  - You A1, other A0: 10 points.
  - You A0, other A1: 12 points.
  - Both choose A1: -1 point.

Clearly, Contract 2 by Player 2 offers better expected payoffs in more scenarios. Player 1's contract imposes a heavy penalty for aggressive plays, while Player 2's contract rewards choosing A0 heavily.

Given the evaluation, it seems beneficial to approve Player 2's contract.

### Final Decision:
```json
{
    "C1": false,
    "C2": true
}
```

By approving Contract 2, the impulsive strategies will be penalized while cooperative strategies tend to generate a higher payoff.

response:
To maximize your points, let's analyze the base game and the effect of the proposed contracts.

### 1. Base Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for Player 1 (you) and Player 2 is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy. Regardless of what Player 1 chooses, Player 1 playing A0 gives Player 2 a choice between 10 (A0) and 20 (A1), so they pick A1. If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 chooses between 2 (A0) and 4 (A1), so they pick A1. Knowing Player 2 will always pick A1, Player 1 must choose between A0 (giving 0) and A1 (giving 4). Thus, the Nash Equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Contract Analysis
Both proposed contracts significantly change the pay structure by penalizing the choice of A1 or rewarding the choice of A0.

**Contract 1 (C1):** If a player chooses A1, they pay 11 points to the other player.
- (A0, A0): (10, 10) — No additional payments.
- (A0, A1): (11, 9) — Player 2 pays 11 to Player 1 (0+11, 20-11).
- (A1, A0): (-5, 13) — Player 1 pays 11 to Player 2 (6-11, 2+11).
- (A1, A1): (4, 4) — Both pay 11 to each other (4-11+11, 4-11+11).

**Contract 2 (C2):** If a player chooses A0, they receive 11 points from the other player.
- (A0, A0): (10, 10) — Both receive and pay 11 (10+11-11, 10+11-11).
- (A0, A1): (11, 9) — Player 1 receives 11 from Player 2 (0+11, 20-11).
- (A1, A0): (-5, 13) — Player 2 receives 11 from Player 1 (6-11, 2+11).
- (A1, A1): (4, 4) — No additional payments.

In both Contract 1 and Contract 2, the payoff matrix becomes identical. Let's find the new Nash Equilibrium:
- If P2 plays A0: P1's best move is A0 (10 > -5).
- If P2 plays A1: P1's best move is A0 (11 > 4).
- If P1 plays A0: P2's best move is A0 (10 > 9).
- If P1 plays A1: P2's best move is A0 (13 > 4).

In the contracted games, **(A0, A0)** becomes the dominant Nash Equilibrium for both players, resulting in **10 points** for each.

### 3. Conclusion
Both C1 and C2 change the equilibrium outcome from 4 points to 10 points for you (Player 1). Since both contracts result in the same beneficial outcome, you should approve both.

{"C1": true, "C2": true}

To maximize your total points, we first analyze the original game and the impact of the proposed contracts.

**Original Game Analysis:**
The payoffs are as follows (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)
In this game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2). Knowing this, Player 1's best response is A1 (4 > 0). The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in 4 points for each player.

**Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
This contract taxes playing A1 by 11 points, given to the other player.
Adjusted payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (11, 9)
- (A1, A0): (-5, 13)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)
In C1, both players have a dominant strategy to play A0 (For P1: 10 > -5 and 11 > 4; For P2: 10 > 9 and 13 > 4). The Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0), resulting in 10 points for each player.

**Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
This contract taxes playing A1 by 5 points, given to the other player.
Adjusted payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (5, 15)
- (A1, A0): (1, 7)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)
For P1, A0 is still dominant (10 > 1 and 5 > 4). However, for P2, if P1 plays A0, P2 achieves a higher payoff by playing A1 (15 > 10). The Nash equilibrium is (A0, A1), resulting in 5 points for Player 1 and 15 points for Player 2.

**Strategic Voting:**
- No contract: 4 points
- C1: 10 points
- C2: 5 points

Your goal is to maximize your own points. C1 is your most favorable outcome. 
If you approve only C1, C1 will have more approvals than C2 provided Player 2 approves C1 or if you have the same number of approvals as C2, giving you a 50% or better chance of C1 winning. If you approve both C1 and C2, you increase the likelihood that C2 (the less favorable 5-point contract) will either win or be part of a tie-break. 

By approving only C1, you maximize the chance that it becomes the contract with the maximum number of approvals, thereby securing the 10-point outcome.

```json

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 11 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
To decide approvals, compare what each contract does to the game incentives and the likely equilibrium outcome (assuming both players play Nash equilibrium after the contract is selected).

### Step 1: Translate each contract into payoff changes
There are 2 players, so if you choose **A1** and the contract says “pay \(t\) split among the other players”, then you pay the full \(t\) to the other player.

So under a tax \(t\) on choosing A1:
- If **you** play A1: your payoff decreases by \(t\), other player increases by \(t\).
- If the **other** plays A1: your payoff increases by \(t\), other decreases by \(t\).
- If both play A1: the transfers cancel out, so (4,4) stays (4,4).

### Step 2: Compute equilibrium under each contract

#### Contract C1 (tax \(t=11\) on A1)
Your payoffs (Player 2):
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives \(20-11=9\) ⇒ prefer **A0**
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives \(2+11=13\), A1 gives 4 ⇒ prefer **A0**

So **A0 becomes your dominant action**.

Similarly for Player 1, with \(t=11\), **A0 is also dominant**.

**Equilibrium:** (A0, A0)  
**Your payoff:** 10

#### Contract C2 (tax \(t=5\) on A1)
Player 1’s payoffs:
- If you play A0: P1 prefers A0 (10 vs \(6-5=1\))
- If you play A1: P1 prefers A0 (5 vs 4)

So Player 1 plays **A0** no matter what.

Given P1 plays A0, your best response:
- A0 gives 10
- A1 gives \(20-5=15\) ⇒ prefer **A1**

**Equilibrium:** (P1 A0, You A1)  
**Your payoff:** 15

### Step 3: Voting implications
Player 1 prefers:
- C1 gives them 10 (from (A0,A0))
- C2 gives them 5 (from (A0,A1))
So Player 1 will approve **C1** and likely not approve C2.

Your best strategy is to **approve only C2**:
- If you approve both, C1 likely wins for sure (2 approvals vs 1), giving you 10.
- If you approve only C2, then each contract gets 1 approval ⇒ tie ⇒ random between them:
  - Expected payoff = 0.5·10 + 0.5·15 = **12.5**, better than 10.

response:
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Analyze the Payoffs Without the Contract
First, we'll calculate the payoffs for each possible action pair without considering the contract.

- If both players choose A0:
  - You get 10 points.
  - The other player gets 10 points.
  
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get 20 points.
  - The other player gets 0 points.
  
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get 2 points.
  - The other player gets 6 points.
  
- If both players choose A1:
  - You get 4 points.
  - The other player gets 4 points.

### Step 2: Analyze the Payoffs With the Contract
Next, let's include the impact of the contract, which adds or subtracts 10 points for choosing A0 or A1 respectively.

- If both players choose A0:
  - You get 10 points from the game and 10 points from the contract: 20 points.
  - The other player gets 10 points from the game and 10 points from the contract: 20 points.
  
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get 20 points from the game minus 10 points from the contract: 10 points.
  - The other player gets 0 points from the game plus 10 points from the contract: 10 points.
  
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get 2 points from the game plus 10 points from the contract: 12 points.
  - The other player gets 6 points from the game minus 10 points from the contract: -4 points.
  
- If both players choose A1:
  - You get 4 points from the game minus 10 points from the contract: -6 points.
  - The other player gets 4 points from the game minus 10 points from the contract: -6 points.

### Step 3: Compare Situations With and Without the Contract
Now we compare the payoffs:

- If both players choose A0:
  - Without the contract: 10 points each.
  - With the contract: 20 points each.

- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - Without the contract: You get 20 points and the other player gets 0 points.
  - With the contract: You get 10 points and the other player gets 10 points.

- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - Without the contract: You get 2 points and the other player gets 6 points.
  - With the contract: You get 12 points and the other player gets -4 points.

- If both players choose A1:
  - Without the contract: 4 points each.
  - With the contract: -6 points each.

### Step 4: Determine Overall Strategy
With the contract, both players have higher payoffs when they both choose A0 (20 points each vs. 10 points each without the contract). The mutual cooperative strategy (both choosing A0) yields better results under the contract for both players. Conversely, choosing A1 results in penalties and, in some cases, negative points.

### Step 5: Decision on Signing the Contract
Since signing the contract incentivizes cooperative behavior and results in higher payoffs for the mutually cooperative strategy (both choosing A0), it is in our best interest to sign the contract.

  "sign": true

Let's go step by step to analyze the game, the contracts, and determine which contracts you (Player 2) should approve.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

We are Player 2. Here's the payoff matrix (rows = my action, columns = other player's action):

|          | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **You A0** | (10, 10)    | (2, 6)      |
| **You A1** | (20, 0)     | (4, 4)      |

We must analyze this as a simultaneous move game, and then consider how each contract modifies the payoffs.

---

### **Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium in the Base Game**

Let’s compute the optimal strategies.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that opponent plays A0
- $ 1-p $ = probability opponent plays A1

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: $ 10p + 2(1-p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $
- If you play A1: $ 20p + 4(1-p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4 $

You are indifferent when:
$ 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 $
→ $ -8p = 2 $
→ $ p = -0.25 $

Not possible (probability can't be negative). So the best response is:
- If p > -0.25 (always true), A1 gives higher payoff.

So for all valid p, $ 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 $ → You always prefer A1.

So **your best response** is **A1** *regardless* of what the opponent does.

Similarly, check opponent’s incentives.

Let’s compute for **opponent** (Player 1), given your strategy.

Let $ q $ = your probability of playing A0.

Opponent’s payoff:
- A0: $ 10q + 6(1-q) = 10q + 6 - 6q = 4q + 6 $
- A1: $ 0q + 4(1-q) = 4 - 4q $

Set equal:
$ 4q + 6 = 4 - 4q $
→ $ 8q = -2 $
→ $ q = -0.25 $

Again, always prefer A1.

So both players have **A1** as dominant strategy.

Thus, **(A1, A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium → you get 4 points.

But note: even though A1 is dominant, the other player gets 0 or 4 when you play A1, and 6 when you play A0. So from their perspective, they prefer you to play A0.

But in equilibrium, you both play A1 → payoff (4, 4).

However, **A1 is dominant for you**, so you should always play A1 unless a contract changes the incentives.

But contracts can change this.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contracts**

We are to approve or deny two contracts. They will be applied **only if both players agree** to the contract (via approval voting), and the winning contract is selected at random from the ones with maximum approvals.

You are **Player 2**, and you get to approve either or both contracts.

We must ask: **Which contracts, if implemented, would improve your expected payoff compared to the base game?**

Let’s analyze each.

---

### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 11 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So, if someone plays A1, they lose 11 points, and those 11 points are split among the *other* players.

Since there are 2 players, the other player gets 11 / 1 = 11 points.

So:
- If *you* play A1 → you lose 11 points.
- If *opponent* plays A1 → you gain 11 points.

This alters the base payoffs.

Let’s compute the **new payoffs** (base payoff + contract payment) for you.

|          | Opp A0 | Opp A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **You A0** | 10 + 0 = 10 | 2 + 0 = 2 |
| **You A1** | 20 + (-11) = 9 | 4 + 11 = 15 |

So new payoff matrix for you:

|          | Opp A0 | Opp A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **You A0** | 10     | 2      |
| **You A1** | 9      | 15     |

Now, let’s find your best response.

Expected payoff if you play A0: $ 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2 $

Expected payoff if you play A1: $ 9p + 15(1-p) = 9p + 15 - 15p = -6p + 15 $

Set equal:
$ 8p + 2 = -6p + 15 $
→ $ 14p = 13 $
→ $ p = 13/14 \approx 0.9286 $

- If $ p > 13/14 $, you prefer A0
- If $ p < 13/14 $, you prefer A1

But note: **A1 is no longer dominant**.

Let’s consider what the opponent will do.

But we need to know: **will the opponent agree to this contract?** That’s not our decision — but crucial for whether this contract is implemented.

But we only care: **if this contract is implemented, is my expected payoff higher than in the base game?**

But remember: the contract only applies **if both agree**.

So we must consider: do I want this contract to be *in effect*? That is, is it beneficial for me, assuming it gets approved?

But here’s the key: **you (Player 2) are deciding whether to approve, but you can’t control the other player.**

But we are told: the winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So for **C1**, if you approve it, and the opponent approves it → it passes.

But if only one approves → no contract.

We want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

So we must evaluate: **would I prefer C1 to be in effect?**

Let’s suppose **C1 is implemented**. Then the new payoff matrix above applies.

But now, the game changes — we re-solve for equilibrium.

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium under C1.

Your best response:
- Play A0 if opponent plays A0 with p > 13/14
- Play A1 if p < 13/14

Opponent’s (Player 1) payoff under C1:

- If opponent plays A0: gets 10 (if you play A0) or 2 (if you play A1)
- If opponent plays A1: gets -11 (if you play A0) + 6 (if you play A1) → actually, we need to build their full payoff.

Wait: **contract: "if a player chooses A1, they pay 11 points, distributed equally among other players"**

So when **opponent plays A1**, they pay 11 points to you (Player 2), so their **net loss of 11 points.

When **you** play A1, you pay 11 points — they gain 11.

So the **total contract payment** depends on who plays what.

Let’s build the **full payoff matrix** under C1 (for both players):

|          | Opp A0 | Opp A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **You A0** | (10, 10) → (10, 10) | (2, 6) → (2, 6) |
| **You A1** | (20, 0) → (20 - 11, 0 + 11) = (9, 11) | (4, 4) → (4 - 11, 4 + 11) = (-7, 15) |

Wait! I think I made a mistake.

When **you** play A1 → you pay 11, so you lose 11.

When **opponent** plays A1 → opponent pays 11, so they lose 11; you gain 11.

So let's correctly compute the full outcomes:

- (A0, A0): no payments → (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): you played A1 → you pay 11 → your total: 20 - 11 = 9; opponent played A0 → no cost; opponent gets 0 → new: (9, 0)?
  Wait — no. Contract: "if a player chooses A1, they pay 11 points, distributed equally among the other players"

So only the player who plays A1 pays.

When you play A1, you pay 11 → you lose 11 → but who gets the 11? "distributed equally among the other players"

Only one other player → you pay 11 to the opponent.

So:
- (A1, A0): you pay 11 → you get 20 - 11 = 9; opponent gets 0 + 11 = 11 → (9, 11)
- (A0, A1): opponent plays A1 → opponent pays 11 → opponent gets 6 - 11 = -5; you get 2 + 11 = 13 → (13, -5)
- (A1, A1): both play A1 → each pays 11 → you get 4 - 11 = -7; opponent gets 4 - 11 = -7 → (-7, -7)

Wait, but this contradicts earlier assumption.

Let’s clarify:
- "If a player chooses A1, they pay 11 points, distributed equally among the other players."

So:
- A1 player **loses 11 points**.
- The other player(s) **gain 11 points total** → since there’s only one other, they get +11.

So yes.

So full payoff matrix under C1:

|          | Opp A0 | Opp A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **You A0** | (10, 10) → (10, 10) | (2, 6) → (2 + 11, 6 - 11) = (13, -5) |
| **You A1** | (20, 0) → (20 - 11, 0 + 11) = (9, 11) | (4, 4) → (4 - 11, 4 - 11) = (-7, -7) |

So corrected:

|          | Opp A0 | Opp A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **You A0** | (10, 10) | (13, -5) |
| **You A1** | (9, 11) | (-7, -7) |

Now, your payoffs:
- A0: 10p + 13(1-p) = 10p + 13 - 13p = -3p + 13
- A1: 9p + (-7)(1-p) = 9p -7 + 7p = 16p - 7

Set equal:
-3p + 13 = 16p - 7 → 13 + 7 = 19p → 20 = 19p → p ≈ 1.0526 → greater than 1 → impossible.

So for all p < 1.0526 (i.e., all valid p), A1 is worse than A0?

Wait: derivative of A0: -3 → decreasing
A1: 16 → increasing

At p = 1:
- A0: -3(1) + 13 = 10
- A1: 16(1) - 7 = 9 → A0 better
At p = 0:
- A0: 13
- A1: -7 → A0 much better

So **A0 dominates A1** for you under C1.

So your best response is always A0.

Now check opponent’s best response.

Opponent's payoffs (Player 1):
- A0: 10p + 6(1-p) = 4p + 6  (where p = your probability of A0)
- A1: 10p (from opponent A0, you A0) → wait no:

Payoffs for opponent:

- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): opponent plays A1 → pays 11 → gets 0 - 11 = -11 → but you play A0 → you get 2 + 11 = 13 → opponent gets -11
- (A0, A1): opponent plays A0 → gets 6 → but you play A1 → you pay 11 → opponent gets 6 + 11 = 17 → no!

Wait — correction:
- When **opponent plays A1**, opponent pays 11 → their payoff is reduced by 11.
- The **other player (you)** gains 11.

So let's build opponent (Player 1) payoffs:

|          | You A0 | You A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Opp A0** | 10     | 0      |
| **Opp A1** | 6 - 11 = -5 | 4 - 11 = -7 |

Wait, no — base payoffs:
- If opponent plays A0, you play A0: (10,10) → so opponent gets 10
- If opponent plays A0, you play A1: (20,0) → opponent gets 0
- If opponent plays A1, you play A0: (2,6) → opponent gets 6
- If opponent plays A1, you play A1: (4,4) → opponent gets 4

Then apply contract:

- If opponent plays A1 → opponent pays 11 → so subtract 11 from their base payoff.
- You gain 11 (since you're other player).

So:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): you A1 → you pay 11 → your payoff 20 - 11 = 9; opponent A0 → no cost → opponent gets 0
- (A0, A1): you A0 → you don't pay; opponent A1 → opponent pays 11 → opponent gets 6 - 11 = -5; you get 2 + 11 = 13
- (A1, A1): both play A1 → you pay 11 → you get 4 - 11 = -7; opponent pays 11 → gets 4 - 11 = -7

So final matrix:

|          | You A0 | You A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Opp A0** | (10, 10) | (9, 0) |
| **Opp A1** | (13, -5) | (-7, -7) |

Now, opponent’s payoffs:
- A0: 10p + 0(1-p) = 10p
- A1: 13p + (-7)(1-p) = 13p -7 +7p = 20p -7

Set equal: 10p = 20p -7 → 10p = 7 → p = 0.7

So if p > 0.7, opponent prefers A0
If p < 0.7, prefers A1

But earlier we found: **you always prefer A0**, because:
- Your payoff: A0 = -3p + 13; A1 = 16p - 7
- A0 > A1 when -3p +13 > 16p -7 → 20 > 19p → p < 20/19 ≈ 1.05 → always true.

So A0 strictly dominates A1 for you.

Thus, in equilibrium, you will play A0 with p = 1.

Then opponent, facing p=1, will play A0 if 10(1) > 20(1) -7 → 10 > 13 → False → so opponent plays A1.

But if you play A0, opponent’s best response:
- A0: 10
- A1: 20(1) -7 = 13 → better

So opponent plays A1.

Then outcome: (A0, A1) → your payoff: 13, opponent: -5

So under **C1**, if both players play optimally, you get **13 points**.

Compare to base game: we got **4 points** in Nash equilibrium.

So **13 > 4** → **C1 is very good for you**.

But wait: does the opponent agree? We don't know yet — but if you **approve** C1, then opponent might approve only if it's good for them.

Opponent’s payoff under C1 in equilibrium: -5

In base game: 4 (from (A1,A1))

So opponent gets -5 < 4 → they **lose** under C1.

Likely **they will not approve** C1.

But you (Player 2) care only about whether **you approve** the contract, assuming it gets implemented.

And if C1 is implemented, you get 13 → much better than 4.

So you should **approve C1**, **if it passes**, because it gives you 13.

But can you get it passed?

Only if **both** approve.

But you are trying to maximize your **expected payoff**, not just your approval.

Now, consider that **if C1 is approved by you**, and opponent **does not**, then C1 does not pass.

So the only way C1 passes is if **both** approve.

But opponent is worse off → likely won’t approve.

So **C1 will not pass**, unless opponent is irrational or has different incentives.

But you are modeling rationally.

So what’s your expected payoff?

If you approve C1:
- With some probability, opponent approves → C1 passes → you get 13
- Or not → game proceeds to base game → you get 4

But **you don’t know** what opponent will do.

But we must think about **incentives**.

Wait: the key is: **you only get the benefit if the contract succeeds**.

But you are only deciding **approval**.

So you must decide: is it worth risking that the contract fails?

But here’s a better way: consider **if you approve C1**, what’s the outcome?

- If opponent approves → contract applies → you get 13
- If opponent doesn’t approve → no contract → you get 4

So your **expected payoff** from approving C1 is:
> p_opponent_approves * 13 + (1 - p_opponent_approves) * 4

Now, what is p_opponent_approves?

The opponent’s payoff in base game: 4

In C1: if C1 passes, they get -5 → which is worse → so they **won’t approve**.

Unless they can get better.

But in C1, if they approve, they get -5 → worse → so no reason to approve.

So p_opponent_approves = 0

Thus, if you approve C1, C1 **does not pass** → you get 4.

Same as base game.

So **no gain**.

But if you **don’t approve**, and opponent doesn’t either → nothing changes → you still get 4.

So **approving C1 gives you no benefit** and **no harm** — same outcome.

But wait — could **C1 lead to higher payoff if both approve**?

Yes — you get 13, they get -5.

But they will **never approve**, because -5 < 4.

So C1 **cannot pass** if you approve it.

Thus, **C1 is useless** for you.

Therefore, **you should not approve C1** — because it doesn’t help, and you can't make it pass.

But what if you **don’t approve**, but opponent does?

Then contract doesn’t pass (needs both), so still no effect.

So only way C1 passes is if both approve.

Opponent will not approve.

So C1 **will never be implemented**, no matter what you do.

So approving C1 is **useless** — it doesn't change the outcome.

But could you get a higher expected payoff?

No — still 4.

So **C1: Don't approve**.

### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments.

So:
- If **you** play A0 → you get +11
- If **opponent** plays A0 → opponent gets +11, you pay 11

This is **very different**.

Let’s compute new payoffs for you.

- If you play A0: +11 for yourself (regardless of opponent)
- If opponent plays A0: you pay 11 (since you are the other player)

So total effect on you:

|          | Opp A0 | Opp A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **You A0** | (10 + 11) - 11 = 10? Wait no.

Wait: when **you play A0**, you gain 11 (from the contract).

When **opponent plays A0**, you pay 11 (since you're the other player).

But when **both** play A0, you gain 11 **and** pay 11 → net 0.

So you get 10 + (you gain 11 if you play A0) - (you pay 11 if opponent plays A0)

So:
- If **you** play A0 → +11
- If **opponent** plays A0 → you pay 11 → -11

So full payoffs for you:

|          | Opp A0 | Opp A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **You A0** | (10 + 11) - 11 = 10 | (2 + 11) + 0 = 13  (opponent A1 → you don’t pay)
| **You A1** | (20) - 11 = 9 | (4) + 0 = 4

So your new payoffs:
- A0: 10 if opp A0, 13 if opp A1
- A1: 9 if opp A0, 4 if opp A1

Now, opponent's payoffs:

- If opponent plays A0 → they gain 11
- If you play A0 → they pay 11

So:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 11 - 11 = 10
- (A1, A0): 0 + 11 - 11 = 0
- (A0, A1): 6 + 11 = 17 (you play A1 → you don’t pay)
- (A1, A1): 4

So opponent’s payoffs:
- A0: 10p + 0(1-p) = 10p
- A1: 17p + 4(1-p) = 13p + 4

Set equal: 10p = 13p + 4 → -3p = 4 → p = -4/3 → impossible.

So opponent always prefers A1? Let’s check.

At p=1: A0: 10, A1: 17 → A1 better
At p=0: A0: 0, A1: 4 → A1 better

So A1 dominates for opponent.

Now, your payoffs:
- A0: 10p + 13(1-p) = 10p + 13 - 13p = -3p + 13
- A1: 9p + 4(1-p) = 9p + 4 - 4p = 5p + 4

Set equal: -3p + 13 = 5p + 4 → 9 = 8p → p = 1.125 > 1 → impossible.

So A0 dominates for you? Check:
- At p=1: A0: -3+13=10, A1: 5+4=9 → A0 better
- At p=0: A0: 13, A1: 4 → A0 better

So yes, A0 strictly dominates for you.

But opponent will play A1 (dominant).

So equilibrium: you play A0, opponent plays A1.

Outcome: (A0, A1) → your payoff: 13

In base game: 4

So **you get 13** → much better.

Now, what about opponent?

They get 17 in this outcome → in base game: 4 → **17 > 4**

So they get **better** payoff.

And the contract is **proposed by you**, Player 2.

So if you approve C2, and opponent sees that they get 17 > 4, they will **also approve**, because they benefit.

Thus, **C2 will pass**.

Therefore, if you approve C2, C2 **passes**, you get **13**.

Compare to base game: 4.

So **you gain 9 points**.

Therefore, **you should approve C2**.

---

### **Summary**

- **C1**: Proposed by Player 1. If implemented, you get 13. But opponent gets -5 < 4 → so they won’t approve → C1 **cannot pass** → no benefit. Approve? No.
- **C2**: Proposed by you, Player 2. If implemented, you get 13, opponent gets 17 → both better → both will approve → C2 **passes** → you get 13. So approve? Yes.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 11 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 3 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 13 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
To maximize my points, I first analyze the original game and then evaluate how each proposed contract affects the payoffs and the resulting equilibrium.

### Original Game Analysis:
The payoff matrix for (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Without a contract, Player 2 has a dominant strategy (A1) because 20 > 10 and 4 > 2. If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1’s best response is A1 (4 > 0). Thus, the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), resulting in 4 points for Player 1.

### Contract 1 (Proposed by Player 1):
- A player playing A1 pays 11 points to the other.
- **New Matrix (C1):**
  - (A0, A0): (10, 10)  (No change)
  - (A0, A1): (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = (11, 9)
  - (A1, A0): (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = (-5, 13)
  - (A1, A1): (4 - 11 + 11, 4 - 11 + 11) = (4, 4)
- **Analysis:** Player 1's dominant strategy becomes A0 (10 > -5 and 11 > 4). Player 2's dominant strategy becomes A0 (10 > 9 and 13 > 4). The new equilibrium is (A0, A0), giving Player 1 **10 points**.

### Contract 2 (Proposed by Player 2):
- A player playing A0 receives 3 points (drawn from the other).
- A player playing A1 pays 13 points (to the other).
- **New Matrix (C2):**
  - (A0, A0): (10 + 3 - 3, 10 + 3 - 3) = (10, 10)
  - (A0, A1): (0 + 3 + 13, 20 - 13 - 3) = (16, 4)
  - (A1, A0): (6 - 13 - 3, 2 + 13 + 3) = (-10, 18)
  - (A1, A1): (4 - 13 + 13, 4 - 13 + 13) = (4, 4)
- **Analysis:** Player 1's dominant strategy becomes A0 (10 > -10 and 16 > 4). Player 2's dominant strategy becomes A0 (10 > 4 and 18 > 4). The new equilibrium is (A0, A0), giving Player 1 **10 points**.

### Conclusion:
Both C1 and C2 successfully change the Nash equilibrium from (A1, A1) to (A0, A0), increasing Player 1's payout from 4 points to 10 points. Since both contracts result in the same optimal outcome for Player 1, they should both be approved.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To maximize your points in this game, let's analyze the potential outcomes under each proposed contract compared to the base game.

### 1. Base Game Analysis
The base game payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In the base game, Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play **A1**. Responding to that, Player 1's best move is also **A1**. This results in a Nash Equilibrium of **(4, 4)**.

### 2. Contract 1 (C1) Analysis
Contract 1 penalizes playing A1 by 11 points (paid to the other player). Let's look at the adjusted payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10) (No change)
- (A0, A1): (0+11, 20-11) = (11, 9)
- (A1, A0): (6-11, 2+11) = (-5, 13)
- (A1, A1): (4-11+11, 4-11+11) = (4, 4) (Payments cancel out)

In C1, Player 1 has a dominant strategy of **A0** (10 > -5 and 11 > 4). Player 2 also has a dominant strategy of **A0** (10 > 9 and 13 > 4). This results in a Nash Equilibrium of **(10, 10)**.

### 3. Contract 2 (C2) Analysis
Contract 2 rewards playing A0 by 5 points (taken from the other player). Let's look at the adjusted payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10+5-5, 10+5-5) = (10, 10) (No net change)
- (A0, A1): (0+5, 20-5) = (5, 15)
- (A1, A0): (6-5, 2+5) = (1, 7)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4) (No change)

In C2, Player 1 has a dominant strategy of **A0** (10 > 1 and 5 > 4). Given Player 1 will play A0, Player 2 will choose **A1** (15 > 10). This results in a Nash Equilibrium of **(5, 15)**.

### 4. Approval Strategy
Comparison of Player 1’s payoffs:
- Base game: 4 points
- Contract 1 (C1): 10 points
- Contract 2 (C2): 5 points

Both contracts are better for Player 1 than the base game. However, Player 1's goal is to maximize their final score. According to the approval voting rules:
- Approving only **C1** is the most robust strategy. If Player 2 also approves C1, it guarantees a payoff of 10.
- If Player 2 only approves C2, approving only C1 results in a coin toss between C1 and C2 (average payoff 7.5), whereas approving both would guarantee C2 (5 points).

Since C1 provides the highest payoff (10 points), and approving C2 only lowers the expected value if a conflict of interest exists between the players (which it does, as Player 2 prefers C2), Player 1 should only approve C1.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
1) **Baseline (no contract):**  
Player 2’s payoffs:  
- If Player 1 plays A0: A1 gives 20 vs A0 gives 10 → prefer **A1**  
- If Player 1 plays A1: A1 gives 4 vs A0 gives 2 → prefer **A1**  
So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2**, implying the (unique) equilibrium is **(A1, A1)** with Player 2 payoff **4**.

2) **Contract C1 (A0 gets +10 paid by the other player):**  
This changes incentives so that Player 1 gets a dominant incentive to play **A0** (they get 10 no matter what, and avoid negative outcomes). With Player 1 playing **A0**, Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1, both yielding **10**.  
So under C1, Player 2 can expect **10** in equilibrium.

3) **Contract C2 (A1 pays 5 to the other player):**  
Player 1 still has a dominant incentive to play **A0** (10 beats 5 or 1). Given Player 1 plays **A0**, Player 2 prefers **A1** because it yields **15** (instead of 10).  
So under C2, equilibrium is **(Player 1 A0, Player 2 A1)** with Player 2 payoff **15**.

4) **Voting/selection logic:**  
Player 1 will likely approve **C1** (they get 10) and reject **C2** (they get 5).  
- If I approve **only C2**, approvals likely become: C1 = 1, C2 = 1 → tie → contract chosen uniformly → my expected payoff = (10 + 15)/2 = **12.5**.  
- If I approve C1 (or both), C1 likely wins outright → payoff **10**.

So my best approval strategy is to **approve only C2**.

To maximize your points, let's analyze the expected outcomes for the original game and the proposed contracts.

**1. Analysis of the Original Game:**
*   Payoffs: (A0,A0) = (10,10), (A0,A1) = (0,20), (A1,A0) = (6,2), (A1,A1) = (4,4).
*   Player 2's dominant strategy is A1 (20 > 10 and 4 > 2).
*   If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1’s best response is A1 (4 > 0).
*   **Outcome: (4, 4)**

**2. Analysis of Contract 1 (C1):**
*   C1: A player choosing A1 pays 11 to the other.
*   New Payoffs:
    *   (A0,A0): (10, 10)
    *   (A0,A1): (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = (11, 9)
    *   (A1,A0): (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = (-5, 13)
    *   (A1,A1): (4 - 11 + 11, 4 - 11 + 11) = (4, 4)
*   Player 1’s strategy: A0 is dominant (10 > -5 and 11 > 4).
*   Player 2’s strategy: A0 is dominant (10 > 9 and 13 > 4).
*   **Outcome: (10, 10)**

**3. Analysis of Contract 2 (C2):**
*   C2: A player choosing A0 receives 5 from the other.
*   New Payoffs:
    *   (A0,A0): (10 + 5 - 5, 10 + 5 - 5) = (10, 10)
    *   (A0,A1): (0 + 5, 20 - 5) = (5, 15)
    *   (A1,A0): (6 - 5, 2 + 5) = (1, 7)
    *   (A1,A1): (4, 4)
*   Player 1’s strategy: A0 is dominant (10 > 1 and 5 > 4).
*   Player 2’s strategy: If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 plays A1 (15 > 10). If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 plays A0 (7 > 4).
*   With Player 1's dominant strategy A0, Player 2 chooses A1.
*   **Outcome: (5, 15)**

**Decision Matrix for Approvals:**
*   Your ranking: C1 (10 or 11) > C2 (5) > No Contract (4).
*   Player 2's potential ranking: C2 (15) > C1 (10) > No Contract (4).

If you approve only C1, the best-case scenario is that C1 is selected. Even if Player 2 approves C2, the maximum number of approvals for both would be 1, leading to a 50/50 chance between C1 and C2, resulting in an expected value of 7.5. If you were to approve both C1 and C2 while Player 2 only approved C2, C2 would win with 2 votes, and you would only receive 5 points. Since both contracts yield more points than the original game, but C1 is significantly better for you, focusing your approval on C1 is the optimal strategy.

response:
The decision-making process involves a strategic analysis of the original game's Nash Equilibrium versus the outcome of the game if a contract is signed.

### Step 1: Analyze the Original Game
The original payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2 is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this game:
- If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2's best response is A1 (20 > 10).
- If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2's best response is A1 (4 > 2).
Thus, Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play **A1**.
- Knowing Player 2 will play A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (4 > 0).
The Nash Equilibrium of the original game is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### Step 2: Analyze the Modified Game (with Contract)
The contract specifies that if a player chooses A0, they receive 11 points from the other player.
- **(A0, A0)**: Both players choose A0. Each receives 11 points and pays 11 points. Payoffs: $10 + 11 - 11 = 10$ for each.
- **(A0, A1)**: Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1. Player 1 receives 11 from Player 2. Payoffs: P1 gets $0 + 11 = 11$; P2 gets $20 - 11 = 9$.
- **(A1, A0)**: Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0. Player 2 receives 11 from Player 1. Payoffs: P1 gets $6 - 11 = -5$; P2 gets $2 + 11 = 13$.
- **(A1, A1)**: Neither chooses A0. Payoffs remain (4, 4).

The modified payoff matrix:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (11, 9)
- (A1, A0): (-5, 13)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this modified game:
- For Player 1: A0 is now a dominant strategy (10 > -5 and 11 > 4).
- For Player 2: A0 is also a dominant strategy (10 > 9 and 13 > 4).
The Nash Equilibrium of the modified game is **(A0, A0)**, resulting in **10 points** for each player.

### Step 3: Compare and Decide
- If the contract is not signed (by either player), the expected outcome is the original equilibrium: **4 points**.
- If the contract is signed by both, the expected outcome is the new equilibrium: **10 points**.
- Player 2 proposed the contract, implying they will sign it. If Player 1 signs, Player 1 increases their payoff from 4 to 10 points.

Therefore, signing the contract is the optimal choice for Player 1.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we must analyze the game outcomes both with and without the contract.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game (No Contract)
First, we identify the Nash equilibrium of the original game:
- **Player 2's Strategy:** 
  - If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets more points from A1 (20) than A0 (10).
  - If Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets more points from A1 (4) than A0 (2).
  - Thus, A1 is a **dominant strategy** for Player 2.
- **Player 1's Strategy:** 
  - Since Player 1 knows Player 2 will play A1, Player 1 compares A0 (0 points) and A1 (4 points).
  - Player 1 will choose A1.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** Both choose A1, resulting in **(4, 4)**.

### 2. Analysis of the Contract
The contract states:
- If a player plays A1, they pay 11 points to the other player.
- If a player plays A0, there is no payment.

**Adjusted Payoff Matrix with Contract:**
- **(A0, A0):** No payments. Payoff: **(10, 10)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 2 plays A1 and pays 11 points to Player 1. Payoff: (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = **(11, 9)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 plays A1 and pays 11 points to Player 2. Payoff: (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = **(-5, 13)**.
- **(A1, A1):** Both play A1. Both pay 11 and receive 11. Payoff: (4 - 11 + 11, 4 - 11 + 11) = **(4, 4)**.

### 3. Analysis of the Contract Game
Now, find the Nash equilibrium with the contract active:
- **Player 1's Strategy:**
  - If Player 2 plays A0: A0 (10) is better than A1 (-5).
  - If Player 2 plays A1: A0 (11) is better than A1 (4).
  - **A0** is now a dominant strategy for Player 1.
- **Player 2's Strategy:**
  - If Player 1 plays A0: A0 (10) is better than A1 (9).
  - If Player 1 plays A1: A0 (13) is better than A1 (4).
  - **A0** is now a dominant strategy for Player 2.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** Both choose A0, resulting in **(10, 10)**.

### 4. Comparison and Decision
- **Without Contract:** Both players receive **4 points**.
- **With Contract:** Both players receive **10 points**.

Since the contract transforms the game from a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma (where the dominant strategy leads to a sub-optimal outcome) into a management game where the socially optimal outcome (A0, A0) becomes the dominant Nash Equilibrium, it is in Player 1's best interest to sign the contract.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to compare the outcomes of the game with and without the contract.

### 1. Game Without the Contract
First, let's analyze the original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Analysis of Strategy:**
- For Player 2, action A1 is always better than A0 (20 > 10 if P1 plays A0; 4 > 2 if P1 plays A1). Thus, A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.
- Since Player 2 will likely choose A1, Player 1 evaluates their best response: 0 (A0) vs. 4 (A1). Thus, Player 1 chooses A1.
- The Nash Equilibrium in the original game is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Game With the Contract
The contract specifies that any player choosing A1 must pay 11 points to the other player. Let's recalculate the payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10) — No payments.
- (A0, A1): Player 2 pays 11 to Player 1. Recalculated: (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = **(11, 9)**.
- (A1, A0): Player 1 pays 11 to Player 2. Recalculated: (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = **(-5, 13)**.
- (A1, A1): Both pay 11 to each other. Recalculated: (4 - 11 + 11, 4 - 11 + 11) = **(4, 4)**.

**Analysis of Strategy with Contract:**
- For Player 1:
  - If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs. -5 (A1). A0 is better.
  - If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 11 (A0) vs. 4 (A1). A0 is better.
  - Action A0 is now a dominant strategy for Player 1.
- For Player 2:
  - If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 (A0) vs. 9 (A1). A0 is better.
  - If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 13 (A0) vs. 4 (A1). A0 is better.
  - Action A0 is now a dominant strategy for Player 2.
- The Nash Equilibrium with the contract is **(A0, A0)**, resulting in **10 points** for each player.

### 3. Comparison and Conclusion
- **Without Contract:** 4 points (A1, A1)
- **With Contract:** 10 points (A0, A0)

Since Both players receive more points under the contract (10 > 4), and Player 2 is also incentivized to sign for the same reason, signing the contract is the optimal move to maximize total points.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Please ONLY provide the output to the above question.

response:
Let's analyze this game step by step and consider the effects of the payment contract on the final payoffs for both players.

### Step 1: Understanding the Base Payoffs
From the given payoff matrix without considering the contract:
- (A0, A0): You get 10 points, other player gets 10 points.
- (A1, A0): You get 20 points, other player gets 0 points.
- (A0, A1): You get 2 points, other player gets 6 points.
- (A1, A1): You get 4 points, other player gets 4 points.

### Step 2: Understanding the Contract Effect
The contract stipulates:
- A player choosing A0 gains an additional 10 points.
- A player choosing A1 loses 10 points.

Let's add the contract effects to the base payoffs:
- (A0, A0): You get 10 + 10 = 20 points, other player gets 10 + 10 = 20 points.
- (A1, A0): You get 20 - 10 = 10 points, other player gets 0 + 10 = 10 points.
- (A0, A1): You get 2 + 10 = 12 points, other player gets 6 - 10 = -4 points.
- (A1, A1): You get 4 - 10 = -6 points, other player gets 4 - 10 = -6 points.

### Step 3: Best Response Analysis
Let's see the best responses considering both players want to maximize their own payoffs:
- If the other player always choosing A0, your best response is A0 (20 points vs 10 points).
- If the other player always choosing A1, your best response is A0 (12 points vs -6 points).

### Step 4: Mixed Strategy Considerations
Given that each player will try to maximize their payoffs considering the other player's move, the logical step is to find the probabilities that balance their strategies.

Here, choosing A0 strictly dominates choosing A1 for both players since:
- Choosing A0 against both A0 and A1 gives strictly higher or equal payoffs compared to choosing A1.

### Decision:
Given the dominance of A0:
- Probability of choosing A0: 100%
- Probability of choosing A1: 0%

### Final JSON Output:
```json
{
  "A0": 100,
  "A1": 0
}
```

Considerations for this specific game setup suggest that the optimal strategy under the given contract is to always choose A0. This ensures the highest expected payoff per the rules and conditions of the game.

To maximize the total points as Player 2, let's analyze the game step by step.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game (No Contract)
Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**P2's Perspective:**
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) or 20 (A1). A1 is better.
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 (A0) or 4 (A1). A1 is better.
P2 has a dominant strategy to play **A1**.

**P1's Perspective:**
- If P2 plays A1 (as expected): P1 gets 0 (A0) or 4 (A1). A1 is better.
The Nash Equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, resulting in **4 points** for each player.

### 2. Analysis of the Game with the Contract
The contract states: if a player plays A1, they pay 11 points to the other player.
New Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = (11, 9)
- (A1, A0): (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = (-5, 13)
- (A1, A1): (4 - 11 + 11, 4 - 11 + 11) = (4, 4)

**P2's Perspective (with contract):**
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) or 9 (A1). A0 is better.
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 13 (A0) or 4 (A1). A0 is better.
P2 now has a dominant strategy to play **A0**.

**P1's Perspective (with contract):**
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) or -5 (A1). A0 is better.
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 11 (A0) or 4 (A1). A0 is better.
P1 now has a dominant strategy to play **A0**.

The new Nash Equilibrium is **(A0, A0)**, resulting in **10 points** for each player.

### 3. Decision
- If the contract is signed by both, the outcome is likely (A0, A0) for **10 points**.
- If the contract is not signed, the outcome is likely (A1, A1) for **4 points**.
Since 10 > 4, signing the contract is the optimal choice for Player 2. Player 1 also benefits (10 > 4) and proposed the contract, so they are likely to sign as well.

response:
First incorporate the contract into your (Player 2’s) payoffs.

**Contract effects**
- If **you play A0**, you **receive +10** from Player 1.
- If **Player 1 plays A0**, you **pay 10** to Player 1.
- If either player plays **A1**, no transfer is triggered by that player.

**Your total payoff (base + contract)**

1) **You A0, P1 A0**: base 10, +10 received, −10 paid ⇒ **10**  
2) **You A1, P1 A0**: base 20, −10 paid ⇒ **10**  
3) **You A0, P1 A1**: base 2, +10 received ⇒ **12**  
4) **You A1, P1 A1**: base 4 ⇒ **4**

So:
- If Player 1 plays **A0**, you get **10** whether you play **A0 or A1** (indifferent).
- If Player 1 plays **A1**, you get **12** with **A0** vs **4** with **A1** (A0 is better).

Therefore **A0 weakly dominates A1**, so the payoff-maximizing strategy is to play **A0 with probability 1**.

- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 11 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to compare the likely outcomes of the game with and without the contract.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game (No Contract)
First, we identify the Nash equilibrium of the original payoff table:
- **If Player 2 plays A0:** Player 1 should play A0 (10 > 6).
- **If Player 2 plays A1:** Player 1 should play A1 (4 > 0).
- **If Player 1 plays A0:** Player 2 should play A1 (20 > 10).
- **If Player 1 plays A1:** Player 2 should play A1 (4 > 2).

Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play **A1**. Knowing this, Player 1's best response to A1 is **A1**. Therefore, without a contract, the players reach the Nash equilibrium of **(A1, A1)**, where both receive **4 points**.

### 2. Analysis of the Contracted Game
The contract specifies that any player who chooses A1 must pay 11 points to the other player. Let's recalculate the payoff table:
- **(A0, A0):** No payments. Payoffs remain **(10, 10)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 2 plays A1 and pays 11 points to Player 1.
  - Player 1: 0 + 11 = 11
  - Player 2: 20 - 11 = 9
  - Payoffs: **(11, 9)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 plays A1 and pays 11 points to Player 2.
  - Player 1: 6 - 11 = -5
  - Player 2: 2 + 11 = 13
  - Payoffs: **(-5, 13)**.
- **(A1, A1):** Both play A1. Both pay 11 points and receive 11 points.
  - Player 1: 4 - 11 + 11 = 4
  - Player 2: 4 - 11 + 11 = 4
  - Payoffs: **(4, 4)**.

### 3. Evaluating Strategies with the Contract
Now we analyze the incentives with the contract active:
- **Player 1's incentives:**
  - If P2 plays A0: P1 prefers A0 (10) over A1 (-5).
  - If P2 plays A1: P1 prefers A0 (11) over A1 (4).
  - **Dominant Strategy for P1: A0.**
- **Player 2's incentives:**
  - If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (10) over A1 (9).
  - If P1 plays A1: P2 prefers A0 (13) over A1 (4).
  - **Dominant Strategy for P2: A0.**

With the contract, both players have a dominant strategy to play **A0**, leading to the outcome **(10, 10)**.

### 4. Comparison and Conclusion
- **Without Contract:** Outcome (4, 4), Player 1 receives **4 points**.
- **With Contract:** Outcome (10, 10), Player 1 receives **10 points**.

Since the objective is to maximize total points, signing the contract is the optimal decision for Player 1. The contract aligns the players' incentives toward the mutually beneficial outcome (A0, A0).

- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 11 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

To maximize points in this game, we first analyze the payoff matrix after incorporating the terms of the contract.

**1. Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
*   (A0, A0): (10, 10)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 20)
*   (A1, A0): (6, 2)
*   (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**2. Impact of the Contract:**
The contract states that any player choosing A1 must pay 11 points to the other player.
*   **Case (A0, A0):** No A1 actions. Payoffs: (10, 10)
*   **Case (A0, A1):** Player 2 chooses A1; Player 2 pays 11 to Player 1.
    *   Player 1: 0 + 11 = 11
    *   Player 2: 20 - 11 = 9
*   **Case (A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1; Player 1 pays 11 to Player 2.
    *   Player 1: 6 - 11 = -5
    *   Player 2: 2 + 11 = 13
*   **Case (A1, A1):** Both choose A1; both pay and receive 11 points (a net transfer of 0).
    *   Player 1: 4 - 11 + 11 = 4
    *   Player 2: 4 - 11 + 11 = 4

**3. Revised Payoff Matrix:**
| | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Player 1 A0** | (10, 10) | (11, 9) |
| **Player 1 A1** | (-5, 13) | (4, 4) |

**4. Strategic Analysis:**
*   **Player 1's perspective:**
    *   If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 10 from A0 and -5 from A1. A0 is better.
    *   If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 11 from A0 and 4 from A1. A0 is better.
    *   **Result:** A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy** for Player 1.

*   **Player 2's perspective:**
    *   If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 10 from A0 and 9 from A1. A0 is better.
    *   If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 gets 13 from A0 and 4 from A1. A0 is better.
    *   **Result:** A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy** for Player 2.

**5. Conclusion:**
Since A0 is the strictly dominant strategy for both players, the Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0). In this scenario, Player 1 receives 10 points. Because A0 outperforms A1 regardless of Player 2's decision, choosing A0 with 100% probability is the optimal choice.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether Player 2 should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

The game is a simultaneous-move game with two players. Player 2 is the one making the decision about the contract.

The payoff matrix (Player 2's payoffs listed first, Player 1’s second) is:

|           | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (10, 10)     | (2, 6)       |
| **Player 2: A1** | (20, 0)      | (4, 4)       |

Our goal is to maximize Player 2’s expected points.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Contract

The contract is proposed by Player 2 and must be signed by **both players** to be activated.

**Contract terms:**
- If a player chooses A0, they **receive an additional 11 points**, which are **drawn equally from the other player(s)**.
    - So, if both players choose A0: Player 2 gets +11, Player 1 loses 11 → net of -11 to Player 1.
    - If only Player 2 chooses A0: Player 2 gets +11, Player 1 pays 11 → so Player 1 loses 11.
    - If only Player 1 chooses A0: Player 1 gets +11, Player 2 pays 11.
    - If no one chooses A0: nobody gets anything.
- If a player chooses A1: **no additional payments**.

So, the contract **incentivizes A0** by subsidizing it with +11 points, **at the expense of the other player**.

---

### Step 3: Assess Impact on Payoffs

Let’s recompute the payoffs for Player 2 **with the contract**.

We need to consider the **new payoff matrix** when the contract is active.

Let’s denote the **modified payoffs** under the contract.

We’ll update each outcome by adding 11 to the player who chose A0, and subtract 11 from the opponent if the opponent chose A1.

But simply:  
- If **Player 2 chooses A0**, they get +11.
- If **Player 1 chooses A0**, they get +11.
- The additional 11 comes from the other player.

So the payoffs become:

#### Case 1: P2 A0, P1 A0
- Base: (10, 10)
- P2 chose A0 → +11
- P1 chose A0 → +11
- So P2 gets 10 + 11 = **21**
- P1 gets 10 + 11 = **21**
→ (21, 21)

#### Case 2: P2 A0, P1 A1
- Base: (2, 6)
- P2 chose A0 → gets +11 → 2 + 11 = **13**
- P1 chose A1 → no change → 6
- But payment must come from the other player? The rule says “drawn equally from the other players”.
- Since only P2 chose A0, the 11 comes from P1 → P1 loses 11
→ So P1 gets 6 - 11 = **-5**
→ (13, -5)

#### Case 3: P2 A1, P1 A0
- Base: (20, 0)
- P2 chose A1 → no bonus → 20
- P1 chose A0 → gets +11 → 0 + 11 = 11
- The cost: P2 must pay 11 → 20 - 11 = **9**
→ (9, 11)

#### Case 4: P2 A1, P1 A1
- Base: (4, 4)
- No one chose A0 → no payments
→ (4, 4)

So the **contracted payoff matrix** is:

|           | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (21, 21) | (13, -5) |
| **P2: A1** | (9, 11)  | (4, 4)   |

---

### Step 4: Determine Whether the Contract Is Desirable for Player 2

Player 2 must decide whether to **sign** the contract.

But note: the contract **only activates if both sign**.

Player 2 is proposing it, so **Player 2 wants it to activate**, but **Player 1 might not sign**.

However, the **key** is to evaluate: **Is it in Player 2’s interest to sign**, under the assumption that Player 1 might also sign (and if not, the contract does nothing)?

So we need to evaluate: **Would Player 2 be better off if the contract is active**, compared to if it is **not**?

We compare outcomes under two scenarios:

---

#### Scenario A: No Contract (Base Game)

Let’s analyze the base game (no contract) to find the best strategy for Player 2.

Payoff matrix (Player 2’s payoffs):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | 10 | 20 |
| **A1** | 2  | 4  |

Let’s look for Nash equilibria.

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 prefers A1 (20 > 10)
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 prefers A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 is dominant for Player 2**.

Similarly, check for P1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 prefers A0 (10 > 6)
- If P2 plays A1: P1 prefers A1 (4 > 0)

So A1 is dominant for P1.

Thus, **(A1, A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium.

In this case, both players play A1 → Payoff: (4, 4)

So **Player 2’s expected payoff without contract**: **4**

(Unless there is a mixed strategy, but since A1 is dominant, playing A1 is best.)

But what if the other player deviates? Since A1 dominates, irrational play won’t help.

So **Player 2 can safely play A1**, and expect **4 points**.

---

#### Scenario B: Contract is Active

Now with the contract, new payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | 21 | 9  |
| **A1** | 13 | 4  |

Let’s find best responses.

For **Player 2**:
- If P1 A0: P2 prefers A0 (21 > 9)
- If P1 A1: P2 prefers A0 (13 > 4)

So **A0 is dominant for Player 2** under contract!

Similarly, check Player 1:
- If P2 A0: P1 prefers A0 (21 > -5)
- If P2 A1: P1 prefers A0 (11 > 4)

So A0 is dominant for P1 too.

So equilibrium becomes **(A0, A0)** → Payoff: (21, 21)

So if **both players sign**, outcome is (21, 21), so Player 2 gets **21**.

But here's the catch: **Player 2 cannot force Player 1 to sign**.

Player 2 can sign or not. If Player 2 signs, and Player 1 doesn’t, then **contract doesn’t activate**.

So the **actual outcome depends on both players’ choices**.

So to make a decision, we need to think: **What will happen if Player 2 signs the contract?**

Let’s model the situation:

---

### Step 5: Strategic Implications of Signed Contract

Let’s suppose Player 2 signs the contract.

Now, Player 1 will choose to sign or not.

Player 1 will compare the **expected payoff** under the contract vs. without.

But Player 1’s decision depends on what they believe Player 2 will do.

Let’s suppose both are rational and try to maximize their own payoffs.

Let’s analyze **Player 1’s incentives**.

---

#### Player 1’s Best Response (from their perspective)

If **Player 1 signs the contract** (and Player 2 already signed), then the **contract activates**.

So they face the contracted game.

From earlier, we saw:
- A0 is dominant for both players under the contract.
- Eq: (A0, A0) → (21, 21)

But wait — **if Player 1 signs**, and Player 2 already signed, **contract is active**.

Player 1's payoffs are:

- If they play A0: gets 21 (if P2 A0), or 11 (if P2 A1)
- If they play A1: gets -5 (if P2 A0), or 4 (if P2 A1)

So they prefer A0 → dominates.

So **Player 1 would want to sign**, because:
- If they sign, they can get at least 11 (if P2 plays A1), but if P2 plays A0, they get 21.
- If they don't sign, the contract doesn’t activate, and they play the base game.

But **if they don't sign**, **contract is inactive** — so base payoffs apply.

So let’s compare:

- If Player 1 **signs** → contract active → they will play A0 (dominant) → P2 plays A0 (also dominant) → outcome: (21, 21)
- If Player 1 **does not sign** → contract **inactive** → base game → both play A1 (dominant) → outcome: (4, 4)

So **if Player 1 signs, they get 21.**  
**If they don’t sign, they get 4.**

So **Player 1 will prefer to sign**, and both will end up playing A0 → both get 21.

So Player 1 **has a strong incentive to sign**.

Now, **Player 2’s decision**: Should they **sign**?

Let’s compare:

- If **Player 2 signs**, and Player 1 rationally responds by signing, then contract activates, both play A0 → **Player 2 gets 21**

- If **Player 2 does not sign**, then contract **does not activate**, regardless of what Player 1 does.

→ So game reverts to base payoffs.

And as we saw, (A1, A1) is the dominant equilibrium → **Player 2 gets 4**

So if Player 2 does not sign → payoffs: 4

If Player 2 signs → they can **induce a cooperative outcome where they get 21**

And since Player 1 also benefits (from 4 to 21), they will **choose to sign**.

So **by signing, Player 2 can get 21** instead of **4**.

Hence, **signing is strictly better**.

Is there any downside?

Only if Player 1 refuses to sign — but if Player 1 refuses, then contract doesn’t activate, and Player 2 gets 4, **same as if they didn’t sign**.

But if Player 2 doesn’t sign, they **also** get 4, regardless.

But if Player 2 signs, and Player 1 signs, they get 21.

And since **Player 1 is rational and benefits**, they will sign.

So **Player 2 is not worse off** even if Player 1 doesn’t sign — they still get 4.

But **they are better off if Player 1 signs** — 21 > 4.

So the **expected payoff** from signing is **greater than or equal to 4**.

So **signing dominates not signing**, **if** Player 1 is rational.

But is there any risk?

Suppose Player 2 signs, Player 1 does **not** sign → contract inactive → base game → (A1, A1) → P2 gets 4.

Same as if P2 didn’t sign.

If P2 doesn’t sign, and P1 doesn’t sign → still base game → 4.

So **P2's payoff is the same whether they sign or not in that case**.

But **if P1 signs**, P2 gets 21 — much better.

So **by signing, P2 has the potential for 21**, and no downside — worst case is 4.

So **signing is weakly dominant** (better or equal in all cases, strictly better in some).

Hence, **signing is optimal**.

Moreover, the contract **helps Player 2** by shifting equilibrium from (A1, A1) → (A0, A0), which is better for Player 2.

Originally, P2 gets 4.

With contract, if both sign, P2 gets 21.

And Player 1 also gains, so they will sign.

So **by signing, Player 2 can trigger a better outcome.**

Therefore, **Player 2 should sign**.

response:
To determine whether Player 2 should sign the contract, let's break down the game step-by-step.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game (Without Contract)
The payoffs for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2) are:
*   (P1=A0, P2=A0): (10, 10)
*   (P1=A0, P2=A1): (0, 20)
*   (P1=A1, P2=A0): (6, 2)
*   (P1=A1, P2=A1): (4, 4)

**Nash Equilibrium Analysis:**
*   **P2's Strategy:** If P1 chooses A0, P2 gets 20 from A1 and 10 from A0 (A1 is better). If P1 chooses A1, P2 gets 4 from A1 and 2 from A0 (A1 is better). A1 is a dominant strategy for P2.
*   **P1's Strategy:** Since P2 is likely to choose A1, P1 compares 0 (A0) and 4 (A1). P1 chooses A1.
*   **Result:** The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) with a payoff of **(4, 4)**.

### 2. Analysis of the Game with the Contract
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn from the other player."
*   **(P1=A0, P2=A0):** Each receives 10 points and gives 10 points. Net change: 0. Payoff: (10, 10).
*   **(P1=A0, P2=A1):** P1 gets 10 points from P2. P1: 0 + 10 = 10. P2: 20 - 10 = 10. Payoff: (10, 10).
*   **(P1=A1, P2=A0):** P2 gets 10 points from P1. P1: 6 - 10 = -4. P2: 2 + 10 = 12. Payoff: (-4, 12).
*   **(P1=A1, P2=A1):** No additional payments. Payoff: (4, 4).

**Nash Equilibrium Analysis with Contract:**
*   **P1's Strategy:** If P2 chooses A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs -4 (A1). If P2 chooses A1, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 4 (A1). A0 is now the dominant strategy for P1.
*   **P2's Strategy:** Since P1 is likely to choose A0, P2 compares 10 (A0) and 10 (A1). P2 is indifferent but earns 10 in either case. If there's any uncertainty about P1 (e.g., if P1 plays A1), P2 prefers A0 (12) over A1 (4).
*   **Result:** The Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0) or (A0, A1), leading to a payoff of **10** for Player 2.

### 3. Conclusion
*   **Without signing:** Player 2 expects **4 points**.
*   **With signing:** Player 2 expects **10 points**.

Since the contract significantly increases the expected payoff by aligning incentives toward the more cooperative-style action (A0), it is rational to sign it.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 11 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 3 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 13 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game from my perspective (Player 2)

My payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20  
- (A0, A1): I get 2
- (A1, A1): I get 4

Opponent's payoffs:
- (A0, A0): They get 10
- (A1, A0): They get 0
- (A0, A1): They get 6
- (A1, A1): They get 4

## Step 2: Find equilibrium in the base game (no contract)

For me: A1 dominates A0 (I get 20 vs 10 when opponent plays A0, and 4 vs 2 when opponent plays A1)

For opponent: Given I play A1, they prefer A1 (4 > 0)

**Base game equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract C1

Contract C1: Playing A1 costs 11 points (paid to opponent)

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20 - 11 = 9
- (A0, A1): 2 + 11 = 13
- (A1, A1): 4

Now A0 dominates A1 (10 > 9 and 13 > 4)

For opponent under C1, A0 also becomes dominant.

**C1 equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Analyze Contract C2

Contract C2: Playing A0 earns 3 points (from opponent), playing A1 costs 13 points

Modified payoffs for me:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 3 - 3 = 10
- (A1, A0): 20 - 13 - 3 = 4
- (A0, A1): 2 + 3 + 13 = 18
- (A1, A1): 4

A0 dominates A1 (10 > 4 and 18 > 4)

For opponent, A0 also becomes dominant.

**C2 equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- No contract: I get 4 points
- Contract C1: I get 10 points  
- Contract C2: I get 10 points

Both contracts lead to the same equilibrium payoff for me (10 points), which is significantly better than no contract (4 points). By approving both contracts, I maximize the probability that at least one contract passes.

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}

To decide if you should approve the proposed contracts, let's first analyze the impact of each contract on the payoff matrix and then calculate the expected points for the best strategies under each contract.

### Base Payoff Matrix (Without Any Contracts):
```
            Player 1
          A0     |     A1
Player 2 ------------------------------------------------
  A0   |  (10, 10)  |  (2, 6)
  A1   |  (20, 0)   |  (4, 4)
```

### Contract Proposed by Player 1:
**Details:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

**Adjusted Payoff Matrix:**
```
            Player 1
          A0     |     A1
Player 2 ------------------------------------------------
  A0   |  (0, 20)   |  (-8, 16)
  A1   |  (20, -10) |  (4, 4)
```

### Contract Proposed by Player 2:
**Details:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 points distributed equally among the other players.

**Adjusted Payoff Matrix:**
```
            Player 1
          A0     |     A1
Player 2 ------------------------------------------------
  A0   |  (0, 20)   |  (-8, 16)
  A1   |  (30, -10) |  (14, -6)
```

### Strategy Analysis

#### 1. Base Game (No Contracts):
- If both players choose A0, both get 10 points each which encourages cooperation.
- If Player 2 (you) chooses A1 while Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets 20 points but Player 1 gets nothing, creating an incentive to defect.
- If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 may wish to defect to A1 to mitigate losses (both getting 4 points).

#### 2. Contract Proposed by Player 1:
- Choosing A0 by either player results in a heavy penalty, discouraging choosing A0.
- Choosing A1 ensures no additional payoffs/penalties.
- Best strategy: Players are likely to choose A1 to avoid penalties.

#### 3. Contract Proposed by Player 2:
- Choosing A0 gets even more discouraging as Players will receive a negative payoff.
- Choosing A1 leads Player 2 to a positive payoff strategy.

### Approval Decision

Given that:
- The base game provides reasonable cooperative payoffs (10 each).
- Player 1’s contract drastically discourages coordination/cooperation by making A0 penalized heavily.

And:
- Player 2’s contract also discourages cooperation through A0 penalizing but also creates a more drastic imbalance where choosing A1 can heavily penalize Player 1 (-6 using A1 in certain scenarios).

Both contracts lack incentive for positive cooperation and significantly discouraging strategies. However, balancing their net impact, Player 2’s strategy slightly more beneficial considering Player 1 has more significant penalties;

### Final Decision:
We'll approve based on minimum negative utility and slight benefit favorability:

```json
{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true
}
```

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we must first incorporate the specific terms of the payment contract into the original payoff matrix. 

### Step 1: Analyze the Original Payoffs
The original payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### Step 2: Incorporate the Contract
The contract specifies:
1. If a player chooses A0, they receive 10 points from the other player.
2. If a player chooses A1, they pay 10 points to the other player.

Let's recalculate the payoffs for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2):

*   **Case (A0, A0):**
    *   P1 chooses A0: Receives 10 from P2.
    *   P2 chooses A0: Receives 10 from P1.
    *   Net adjustment: +10 - 10 = 0.
    *   **Revised Payoff: (10, 10)**

*   **Case (A0, A1):**
    *   P1 chooses A0: Receives 10 from P2.
    *   P2 chooses A1: Pays 10 to P1.
    *   Net adjustment for P1: +10 + 10 = +20.
    *   Net adjustment for P2: -10 - 10 = -20.
    *   **Revised Payoff: (0 + 20, 20 - 20) = (20, 0)**

*   **Case (A1, A0):**
    *   P1 chooses A1: Pays 10 to P2.
    *   P2 chooses A0: Receives 10 from P1.
    *   Net adjustment for P1: -10 - 10 = -20.
    *   Net adjustment for P2: +10 + 10 = +20.
    *   **Revised Payoff: (6 - 20, 2 + 20) = (-14, 22)**

*   **Case (A1, A1):**
    *   P1 chooses A1: Pays 10 to P2.
    *   P2 chooses A1: Pays 10 to P1.
    *   Net adjustment: -10 + 10 = 0.
    *   **Revised Payoff: (4, 4)**

### Step 3: Revised Payoff Matrix
The updated payoffs reflect the contract:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (20, 0)
- (A1, A0): (-14, 22)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### Step 4: Strategic Analysis
Now we evaluate the best action for Player 1:
- If Player 2 chooses **A0**: Player 1 gets **10** from A0 and **-14** from A1. (A0 is better)
- If Player 2 chooses **A1**: Player 1 gets **20** from A0 and **4** from A1. (A0 is better)

Regardless of Player 2's decision, A0 is the dominant strategy for Player 1. Similarly, analyzing Player 2's options:
- If Player 1 chooses **A0**: Player 2 gets **10** (A0) vs **0** (A1).
- If Player 1 chooses **A1**: Player 2 gets **22** (A0) vs **4** (A1).

A0 is the dominant strategy for both players. Choosing A0 maximizes the expected points.

### Final Strategy
Since A0 is strictly dominant for both players under the contract, we assign a 100% probability to Action A0.

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine the optimal strategy, let's analyze the impact of the payment contract on the original payoff matrix.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Payoff Matrix
The original points (Player 1, Player 2) are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### 2. Analysis of the Payment Contract
The contract states that any player choosing A1 must pay 11 points to the other player.
- **If Player 1 chooses A1:** 11 points are subtracted from Player 1's score and 11 points are added to Player 2's score.
- **If Player 2 chooses A1:** 11 points are subtracted from Player 2's score and 11 points are added to Player 1's score.
- **If both choose A1:** Player 1 pays 11 and receives 11 (net 0 adjustment). Player 2 pays 11 and receives 11 (net 0 adjustment).

### 3. Adjusted Payoff Matrix
Applying these rules to the original matrix gives the following adjusted points:
- **(A0, A0):** (10, 10)
- **(A0, A1):** (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = **(11, 9)**
- **(A1, A0):** (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = **(-5, 13)**
- **(A1, A1):** (4 - 11 + 11, 4 - 11 + 11) = **(4, 4)**

### 4. Strategic Assessment
Now we identify the best strategies based on the adjusted matrix:
- **Player 1's Perspective:**
  - If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 10 from A0 vs. -5 from A1. **A0 is better.**
  - If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 11 from A0 vs. 4 from A1. **A0 is better.**
  - Action **A0** is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1.

- **Player 2's Perspective:**
  - If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 10 from A0 vs. 9 from A1. **A0 is better.**
  - If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 gets 13 from A0 vs. 4 from A1. **A0 is better.**
  - Action **A0** is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2 as well.

### 5. Conclusion
Since A0 is the strictly dominant strategy for both players, the rational outcome of the game is for both players to choose A0 with 100% probability. This results in the highest stable payoff for both players given the modified incentives.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 11 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
To maximize the total points received, let's step through the impact of the payment contract on the original payoff structure.

**1. Analyze the Original Payoffs:**
* (A0, A0): P1=10, P2=10
* (A0, A1): P1=0, P2=20
* (A1, A0): P1=6, P2=2
* (A1, A1): P1=4, P2=4

**2. Incorporate the Payment Contract:**
The contract states that if a player chooses A1, they pay 11 points to the other player(s).
* **If Scenario is (A0, A0):** No one pays.
  P1: 10, P2: 10
* **If Scenario is (A0, A1):** Player 2 pays Player 1 eleven points.
  P1: 0 + 11 = 11, P2: 20 - 11 = 9
* **If Scenario is (A1, A0):** Player 1 pays Player 2 eleven points.
  P1: 6 - 11 = -5, P2: 2 + 11 = 13
* **If Scenario is (A1, A1):** Player 1 pays Player 2 eleven points, and Player 2 pays Player 1 eleven points.
  P1: 4 - 11 + 11 = 4, P2: 4 - 11 + 11 = 4

**3. Determine the Adjusted Strategic Incentives:**
* **Player 1's Perspective:**
  * If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 10 from A0 and -5 from A1. (A0 is better)
  * If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 11 from A0 and 4 from A1. (A0 is better)
  * Choosing A0 is a **dominant strategy** for Player 1.
* **Player 2's Perspective:**
  * If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 10 from A0 and 9 from A1. (A0 is better)
  * If Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 13 from A0 and 4 from A1. (A0 is better)
  * Choosing A0 is a **dominant strategy** for Player 2.

**4. Conclusion:**
Because the 11-point penalty for choosing A1 is higher than the relative gains from the original game, both players are now strictly incentivized to choose A0. The contract effectively shifts the Nash Equilibrium from (A1, A1) to the more productive (A0, A0), increasing both players' expected outcomes.

Detailed reasoning:
1.  **Analyze the original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
    *   (A0, A0): (10, 10)
    *   (A0, A1): (0, 20)
    *   (A1, A0): (6, 2)
    *   (A1, A1): (4, 4)

2.  **Analyze the contract's impact:**
    The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."
    In a two-player game, this means:
    *   If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 1 gets +11 points, and Player 2 loses 11 points.
    *   If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 2 gets +11 points, and Player 1 loses 11 points.
    *   If both choose A0: Player 1 gets +11 (his A0) and loses 11 (Player 2's A0), net 0. Player 2 also gets +11 and loses 11, net 0.

3.  **Calculate the new payoff matrix (Original Payoff + Contract Payment):**
    *   **(A0, A0):** Original (10, 10). Net contract change for both is 0. Final: (10, 10).
    *   **(A0, A1):** Original (0, 20). Player 1 chooses A0 (+11), Player 2 chooses A1 (-11). Final: (11, 9).
    *   **(A1, A0):** Original (6, 2). Player 1 chooses A1 (-11), Player 2 chooses A0 (+11). Final: (-5, 13).
    *   **(A1, A1):** Original (4, 4). No contract payments. Final: (4, 4).

4.  **Determine the optimal strategy for Player 1:**
    *   If Player 2 plays A0: Player 1 compares A0 (10 points) vs A1 (-5 points). A0 is better.
    *   If Player 2 plays A1: Player 1 compares A0 (11 points) vs A1 (4 points). A0 is better.
    A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1.

5.  **Determine the optimal strategy for Player 2:**
    *   If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 compares A0 (10 points) vs A1 (9 points). A0 is better.
    *   If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 compares A0 (13 points) vs A1 (4 points). A0 is better.
    A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2.

6.  **Conclusion:**
    Since A0 is the dominant strategy for both players, the rational outcome is (A0, A0). Player 1 should commit 100% to A0 to maximize their points.

response:
To maximize the total points received, we first compare the outcomes of the game with and without the proposed contract.

**Step 1: Analyze the base game (no contract).**
The payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2 is:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

In this game, Player 2 has a strictly dominant strategy: **A1**. (If Player 1 plays A0, 20 > 10; if Player 1 plays A1, 4 > 2).
Knowing Player 2 will play A1, Player 1’s best response is **A1** (4 > 0).
The Nash Equilibrium for the base game is (A1, A1), yielding **4 points** for Player 1.

**Step 2: Analyze the contracted game.**
The contract specifies that any player choosing A1 pays 11 points to the other player. The new payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10) (No payments)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = (11, 9)
- (A1, A0): (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = (-5, 13)
- (A1, A1): (4 - 11 + 11, 4 - 11 + 11) = (4, 4)

In this contracted game, Player 1 has a strictly dominant strategy: **A0**. (If Player 2 plays A0, 10 > -5; if Player 2 plays A1, 11 > 4).
Knowing Player 1 will play A0, Player 2’s best response is **A0** (10 > 9).
The Nash Equilibrium for the contracted game is (A0, A0), yielding **10 points** for Player 1.

**Step 3: Evaluate the decision to sign.**
- If the contract is active (both players sign), the equilibrium outcome is 10 points for Player 1.
- If the contract is not active (one or both players do not sign), the game reverts to the base version, where the equilibrium outcome is 4 points for Player 1.
- Since 10 > 4, it is in Player 1's best interest to sign the contract.
- Furthermore, since Player 2 also benefits (10 > 4), it is highly likely they will sign as well.

Signing the contract converts a Prisoners' Dilemma-style equilibrium (A1, A1) into a mutually beneficial coordination outcome (A0, A0).

response:
To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and then consider the impact of the payment contract. 

### Step 1: Analyze the Original Payoffs
Based on the description provided for Player 2:
- (P1: A0, P2: A0) = (10, 10)
- (P1: A0, P2: A1) = (0, 20)
- (P1: A1, P2: A0) = (6, 2)
- (P1: A1, P2: A1) = (4, 4)

### Step 2: Incorporate the Payment Contract
The contract specifies that any player who chooses action A1 must pay 11 points to the other player.
- **Both choose A0**: No additional payments.
  - Payoff: (10, 10)
- **P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1**: P2 pays 11 points to P1.
  - Payoff: (0 + 11, 20 - 11) = (11, 9)
- **P1 chooses A1, P2 chooses A0**: P1 pays 11 points to P2.
  - Payoff: (6 - 11, 2 + 11) = (-5, 13)
- **Both choose A1**: P1 pays 11 to P2, and P2 pays 11 to P1. These payments cancel out.
  - Payoff: (4, 4)

### Step 3: Identify the Adjusted Payoff Matrix (P1, P2)
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10) | (11, 9) |
| **P1: A1** | (-5, 13) | (4, 4) |

### Step 4: Determine the Optimal Strategy
- **For Player 2 (Me)**:
  - If P1 chooses A0, I receive 10 points for choosing A0 and 9 points for choosing A1.
  - If P1 chooses A1, I receive 13 points for choosing A0 and 4 points for choosing A1.
  - In both scenarios, choosing **A0** yields a higher payoff. A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 2.

- **For Player 1**:
  - If P2 chooses A0, P1 receives 10 points for choosing A0 and -5 points for choosing A1.
  - If P2 chooses A1, P1 receives 11 points for choosing A0 and 4 points for choosing A1.
  - In both scenarios, choosing **A0** yields a higher payoff for Player 1. A0 is also a dominant strategy for Player 1.

The Nash Equilibrium of this game, given the contract, is (A0, A0), providing each player with 10 points. Since A0 is the dominant strategy for Player 2, the optimal choice is to play A0 with 100% probability.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
To maximize the total points as Player 2, we first analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating the base game rules and the additional payment contract.

### 1. Identify Base Payoffs (Player 2 is "You", Player 1 is "Other")
*   (P2: A0, P1: A0) → P2: 10, P1: 10
*   (P2: A1, P1: A0) → P2: 20, P1: 0
*   (P2: A0, P1: A1) → P2: 2, P1: 6
*   (P2: A1, P1: A1) → P2: 4, P1: 4

### 2. Apply the Payment Contract
The contract states:
*   If a player chooses **A0**, they receive +10 points from the other player.
*   If a player chooses **A1**, no payment occurs.

**Calculating new payoffs:**
*   **(A0, A0):**
    *   P2 receives +10 from P1 (for A0) and pays 10 to P1 (for P1’s A0). Net change: 0.
    *   **Total: P2: 10, P1: 10**
*   **(A1, A0):**
    *   P1 chooses A0, so P1 receives +10 from P2. P2 chooses A1, so 0 payment to P2.
    *   **Total: P2: 20 - 10 = 10, P1: 0 + 10 = 10**
*   **(A0, A1):**
    *   P2 chooses A0, so P2 receives +10 from P1. P1 chooses A1, so 0 payment to P1.
    *   **Total: P2: 2 + 10 = 12, P1: 6 - 10 = -4**
*   **(A1, A1):**
    *   No A0 chosen, so no payments.
    *   **Total: P2: 4, P1: 4**

### 3. Analyze the Strategies
*   **Player 1's Payoffs:**
    *   If P1 plays A0: They get 10 regardless of what Player 2 does.
    *   If P1 plays A1: They get -4 or 4.
    *   **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1.**

*   **Player 2's Payoffs:**
    *   If P1 plays A0 (their dominant strategy): P2 gets 10 by playing A0 or 10 by playing A1.
    *   If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 12 by playing A0 or 4 by playing A1.
    *   **A0 is a weakly dominant strategy for Player 2.**

### 4. Conclusion
Player 1 will realistically play A0 100% of the time because it guarantees them their maximum possible payoff (10) and is strictly better than A1. If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 is indifferent (10 vs 10). However, if there is even a slight probability of Player 1 deviating to A1 (due to error or experimentation), playing A0 becomes strictly better for Player 2 (12 vs 4). Given the goal to maximize total points, A0 is the most robust and secure choice.

- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

Without any contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 10, Player 1 gets 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20, Player 1 gets 0  
- (A0, A1): I get 2, Player 1 gets 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4, Player 1 gets 4

## Step 2: Analyze the game without contract

From my perspective:
- If Player 1 plays A0: A1 gives me 20 vs A0 gives me 10 → I prefer A1
- If Player 1 plays A1: A1 gives me 4 vs A0 gives me 2 → I prefer A1

So A1 dominates A0 for me.

From Player 1's perspective:
- If I play A0: They prefer A0 (10) over A1 (6)
- If I play A1: They prefer A1 (4) over A0 (0)

The Nash equilibrium without contract is **(A1, A1) giving me 4 points**.

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs with the contract

With contract, if someone plays A1, they pay 11 points to the other player:
- (A0, A0): I get 10, Player 1 gets 10 (no change)
- (A1, A0): I get 20 - 11 = 9, Player 1 gets 0 + 11 = 11
- (A0, A1): I get 2 + 11 = 13, Player 1 gets 6 - 11 = -5
- (A1, A1): I get 4 - 11 + 11 = 4, Player 1 gets 4 - 11 + 11 = 4

## Step 4: Analyze the game with contract

From my perspective:
- If Player 1 plays A0: A0 gives me 10 vs A1 gives me 9 → I prefer A0
- If Player 1 plays A1: A0 gives me 13 vs A1 gives me 4 → I prefer A0

Now **A0 dominates A1** for me!

Similar analysis shows A0 also dominates A1 for Player 1.

The Nash equilibrium with contract is **(A0, A0) giving me 10 points**.

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: I get 4 points
- **With contract**: I get 10 points

The contract increases my expected payoff from 4 to 10 points by making the costly action A1 unprofitable and enabling cooperation at (A0, A0).

**Conclusion**: I should sign the contract.

response:
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

We are Player 2 (the one who proposed the contract). The payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0        | A1        |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**               | (10, 10)  | (2, 6)    |
| **A1**               | (20, 0)   | (4, 4)    |

So:
- If both play A0: (10, 10)
- You (P2) play A0, P1 plays A1: (2, 6)
- You play A1, P1 plays A0: (20, 0)
- Both A1: (4, 4)

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

The contract was **proposed by Player 2** and approved via voting. The key part:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 11 points**, **drawn equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

This means:
- Whenever **you (Player 2)** choose A0, you get **+11** extra points **from Player 1**.
- Whenever **Player 1** chooses A0, they get **+11** extra points **from you (Player 2)**.

**Important**: The extra 11 points are deducted from the other player. So it's a transfer from the other player to the A0 chooser.

Let’s adjust the payoff matrix to include the **contract effect**.

---

### **Step 3: Adjust Payoffs to Include Contract**

Let’s rewrite the payoffs **in your perspective: Player 2.**

For each outcome, we add:
- +11 to you (P2) if you choose A0.
- -11 from you (P2) if Player 1 chooses A0 (because you pay them 11).
> So both choices have **net effect**:  
> - If **you** play A0 → +11  
> - If **they** play A0 → -11 (you lose 11)

Hence, net adjustment for your payoff when (P1, P2) = (A0, A0) → +11 (you), -11 (they)

So final payoffs are:

#### Case 1: P1 = A0, P2 = A0
- Base: (10, 10)
- You (P2) get +11 (because you played A0)
- P1 gets +11 (because P1 played A0 → you pay them 11)
- So you get: 10 + 11 = **21**
- P1 gets: 10 + 11 = **21**

> But wait: the contract says the **player choosing A0 gets +11**, drawn from the other player.

So for Player 1: they get +11 from you (since they chose A0)  
For Player 2: you get +11 from Player 1 (since you chose A0)

So both players get +11 **if they choose A0**, and they **each take 11 from the other**.

So **if both choose A0**: each gets +11 (from the other).  
Total transfer: you get +11 from P1, but pay P1 +11 (from you), so **net +11**, but **in your payoff**, it's just +11 from the contract.

So yes:
- Your payoff = base + 11 (for your A0)
- But P1’s payoff = base + 11 (for their A0)

So:
- (A0, A0): You get 10 + 11 = **21**, P1 gets 10 + 11 = **21**

#### Case 2: P1 = A1, P2 = A0
- Base: you get 2, P1 gets 6
- You chose A0 → +11
- P1 did **not** choose A0 → no extra
- So your payoff: 2 + 11 = **13**
- P1: 6 (no change)

#### Case 3: P1 = A0, P2 = A1
- Base: you get 20, P1 gets 0
- You chose A1 → no extra
- P1 chose A0 → so P1 gets +11 from you
- So you **lose 11** to P1
- Your payoff: 20 - 11 = **9**
- P1: 0 + 11 = 11

#### Case 4: P1 = A1, P2 = A1
- Base: (4, 4)
- Both chose A1 → no extra payments
- So payoffs: **4** for you, **4** for P1

---

### **Step 4: Final Adjusted Payoff Matrix (for You, Player 2)**

| P1 \ P2 | A0     | A1     |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A0     | 21     | 9      |
| A1     | 13     | 4      |

Wait: Let’s double-check:

- (A0, A0): you get base 10 + 11 (contract) = 21 ✅
- (A0, A1): you get base 20 - 11 (because P1 gets +11 from you) = 9 ✅
- (A1, A0): you get base 2 + 11 = 13 ✅
- (A1, A1): base 4, no contract → 4 ✅

Yes, correct.

So your payoff matrix (as P2) is:

| P1 \ P2 | A0   | A1   |
|--------|------|------|
| A0     | 21   | 9    |
| A1     | 13   | 4    |

---

### **Step 5: Choose a Strategy (Probability Distribution) to Maximize Expected Payoff**

You choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (let **p** = P(P2 = A0), so A1 = 1 - p).

Let **q** = P(P1 = A0), so A1 = 1 - q.

Your expected payoff:
$$
E = q \cdot (21p + 13(1-p)) + (1-q) \cdot (9p + 4(1-p))
$$
Simplify:

First term: q × [21p + 13 - 13p] = q × (8p + 13)

Second term: (1-q) × [9p + 4 - 4p] = (1-q) × (5p + 4)

So:
$$
E = q(8p + 13) + (1 - q)(5p + 4)
$$

Now expand:
$$
E = q(8p + 13) + (5p + 4) - q(5p + 4)
$$
$$
E = q[(8p + 13) - (5p + 4)] + (5p + 4)
$$
$$
E = q(3p + 9) + (5p + 4)
$$

Now, since **Player 1** is rational and will choose **q** to minimize **your** expected payoff (because they are maximizing **their own** payoff, which is different), we need to assume that P1 acts optimally.

But wait: **We are maximizing our expected payoff** under the assumption that P1 is also playing optimally (i.e., we look for a Nash equilibrium).

So we need to find a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**, where:
- You (P2) play p such that P1 is indifferent over A0 and A1, and
- P1 plays q such that you are indifferent over A0 and A1.

But since we are **Player 2 (you)**, and you are the one proposing the contract, you can **choose your strategy** to maximize your expected payoff **assuming P1 responds rationally**.

So let's compute the **best response** of P1 to your strategy, and then pick p that maximizes your payoff under that.

---

### **Step 6: Compute P1’s Best Response to Your Strategy (p)**

P1’s payoff depends on their action.

Let’s write P1’s payoffs (as a function of p).

- If P1 plays A0:
  - With probability p: you play A0 → payoff: 21 (from above matrix)
  - With probability 1-p: you play A1 → payoff: 9
  - So expected payoff: **21p + 9(1-p) = 12p + 9**

- If P1 plays A1:
  - With probability p: you play A0 → payoff: 13
  - With probability 1-p: you play A1 → payoff: 4
  - Expected payoff: **13p + 4(1-p) = 9p + 4**

P1 will choose A0 if:
$$
12p + 9 > 9p + 4 \Rightarrow 3p > -5 \Rightarrow p > -5/3
$$
Always true! So this suggests P1 always prefers A0?

Wait — that can't be right. Let's recompute P1's payoff.

Wait! We made a mistake.

Earlier we computed the **payoff matrix from your view**, but we must now consider **P1’s true payoffs** under the contract!

We need to go back and update **P1’s payoff**.

---

### **Step 7: Re-calculate P1’s Payoffs Including Contract**

Let’s now compute **P1’s final payoffs** under the contract.

The contract says:
- If a player chooses A0, they get +11 from the other player.

So:
- P1 gets +11 if they play A0 (paid by you).
- You (P2) get +11 if you play A0 (paid by P1).

So, for each outcome, we must add:
- +11 to P1 if P1 plays A0
- -11 to P1 if P1 plays A0 → no, they get +11 from you

So P1's payoffs = base + 11 (if P1 plays A0) + (possibly +11 from contract if they play A0, but they get it regardless)

Wait: P1 gets +11 **if they play A0**, from you (P2).

So:

#### Case 1: P1 = A0, P2 = A0
- Base payoff for P1: 10
- P1 played A0 → gets +11 from you
- So total: 10 + 11 = **21**

#### Case 2: P1 = A0, P2 = A1
- Base: 0
- P1 played A0 → gets +11 from you
- So total: 0 + 11 = **11**

#### Case 3: P1 = A1, P2 = A0
- Base: 6
- P1 played A1 → no extra
- So total: 6

#### Case 4: P1 = A1, P2 = A1
- Base: 4
- P1 played A1 → no extra
- So total: 4

So P1’s payoff matrix (P2's choice is the row index):

| P1 \ P2 | A0   | A1   |
|--------|------|------|
| A0     | 21   | 11   |
| A1     | 6    | 4    |

Note: This is different from what we had earlier for P2.

So P1 strongly prefers A0.

Now, if P2 plays A0, P1 gets:
- A0: 21
- A1: 6 → so would choose A0

If P2 plays A1, P1 gets:
- A0: 11
- A1: 4 → still chooses A0

So **no matter what P2 does**, P1’s best response is **always A0**.

Because even if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 11 vs 4 → still prefers A0.

So P1 will **always choose A0** if they are rational.

---

### **Step 8: What Should You (Player 2) Do Now?**

Since P1 will **always choose A0** (no matter what you do), you can treat their strategy as **q = 1**.

So your expected payoff depends only on your own choice:

- If you play **A0**: probability = 1 (P1 plays A0), so payoff = **21** (from earlier)
- If you play **A1**: payoff = **9** (from earlier matrix: P1 = A0, you = A1 → 9)

So clearly, **A0 gives 21**, **A1 gives 9** → you should play A0.

But wait: what if P1 is **not** rational? But the problem says this is a game with rational decision-makers unless stated otherwise.

Also, the contract was **proposed by you**, and it’s designed to benefit you. You want to maximize your payoff.

But you must **choose a probability distribution**, so you can mix.

But since P1 will **always play A0**, and your payoff is:

- A0: 21
- A1: 9

You should play A0 with probability 100.

So **p = 100**, **A1 = 0**.

Is there any risk in playing A0? No — P1 will always play A0, and you get 21.

If you play A1, you only get 9 — worse.

So **best choice: play A0 with 100% probability**.

But wait — what if P1 **doesn’t** play A0?

Wait: we saw that **P1’s best response to any p is A0**, because even if you play A1, P1 gets 11 (by playing A0) vs 4 (by playing A1) → so always prefer A0.

So **P1 will never play A1**, regardless of what you do.

So you can safely assume P1 plays A0.

Therefore, your optimal strategy is **fully play A0**.

---

### **Step 9: Final Answer**

You should choose:
- A0: 100%
- A1: 0%

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
To determine whether I should sign the contract, I need to carefully analyze the impact of the contract on my total points received under different action combinations. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding Base Payoffs**:
   - If both choose A0: We both get 10 points.
   - If I choose A1 and the other chooses A0: I get 20 points, the other gets 0 points.
   - If I choose A0 and the other chooses A1: I get 2 points, the other gets 6 points.
   - If both choose A1: We both get 4 points.

2. **Understanding the Contract**:
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 10 points from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 10 points to the other player.

3. **Payoffs with Contract Signed**:
   - If both choose A0:
     - Both players get base 10 points.
     - Both receive an additional 10 points (i.e. net +10 points each due to the structure of transfer).
     - Therefore, payoff: each = 10 + 10 = 20 points.
   - If I choose A1 and the other chooses A0:
     - I get base 20 points, pay 10 points (net gain −10 points).
     - The other gets base 0 points, receives 10 points from me (net gain +10 points).
     - Therefore, payoff: I get 20 − 10 = 10 points, other gets 0 + 10 = 10 points.
   - If I choose A0 and the other chooses A1:
     - I get base 2 points, receive 10 points (net gain +10 points).
     - The other gets base 6 points, pays 10 points (net loss −10 points).
     - Therefore, payoff: I get 2 + 10 = 12 points, other gets 6 − 10 = −4 points.
   - If both choose A1:
     - Both get base 4 points.
     - Both pay additional 10 points to each other (net effect is −10 points each).
     - Therefore, payoff: each = 4 − 10 = −6 points.

### Decision to Sign the Contract:
The contract alters the potential strategies and outcomes, making the choice between A0 and A1 more significant due to the associated payments.

### Rational Move:
- The assured mutual benefit favors a mutual A0 choice due to both getting 20 points, the highest possible under the new system.
- Riskier moves (choosing A1) can dramatically reduce total points and are less attractive.

Based on maximizing total points and considering mutual gain:

**Conclusion**: Signing the contract seems to optimally alter decision incentives toward the mutual benefit strategy (A0,A0), yielding a more stable high-reward outcome.

Therefore, the answer is:

```json
{"sign": true}
```

response:
1) Compute resulting payoffs under each contract (the “additional payment for choosing A0” is a transfer from the *other* player to the A0-chooser).

### Contract C1 (A0 gets +11 from the other player)
Payoffs (P1,P2):
- (A0,A0): (10+11−11, 10+11−11) = (10,10)
- (A0,A1): (0+11, 20−11) = (11,9)
- (A1,A0): (6−11, 2+11) = (−5,13)
- (A1,A1): (4,4)

Best responses:
- For P1: A0 beats A1 whether P2 plays A0 (10 > −5) or A1 (11 > 4) ⇒ **A0 strictly dominates**.
- For P2: similarly A0 strictly dominates.

So the equilibrium is **(A0,A0)** giving **P1 = 10**.

### Contract C2 (A0 gets +5 from the other player)
Payoffs (P1,P2):
- (A0,A0): (10,10)
- (A0,A1): (0+5, 20−5) = (5,15)
- (A1,A0): (6−5, 2+5) = (1,7)
- (A1,A1): (4,4)

Best responses:
- For P1: A0 beats A1 whether P2 plays A0 (10 > 1) or A1 (5 > 4) ⇒ **A0 strictly dominates**.
- Given P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A1 (15 > 10).

So the equilibrium is **(A0,A1)** giving **P1 = 5**.

2) Voting implication for me (P1):
- I prefer **C1 (10)** over **C2 (5)**.
- Approving C2 can only help C2 win (especially if P2 approves C2), which hurts me.
- So I approve **only C1**.

In this game, the original payoffs are significantly modified by the contract requiring any player who chooses action A1 to pay 11 points to the other player. Let's analyze the new payoff matrix for both Player 1 (me) and Player 2 (the other player):

1.  **If we both choose A0:**
    *   Player 1: 10 + 0 = 10 points
    *   Player 2: 10 + 0 = 10 points

2.  **If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:**
    *   Player 1: 0 (original) + 11 (from Player 2) = 11 points
    *   Player 2: 20 (original) - 11 (payment) = 9 points

3.  **If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:**
    *   Player 1: 6 (original) - 11 (payment) = -5 points
    *   Player 2: 2 (original) + 11 (from Player 1) = 13 points

4.  **If we both choose A1:**
    *   Player 1: 4 (original) - 11 (payment) + 11 (from Player 2) = 4 points
    *   Player 2: 4 (original) - 11 (payment) + 11 (from Player 1) = 4 points

**Strategy Analysis:**
- For **Player 1**: If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 10 points from A0 vs -5 points from A1. If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 11 points from A0 vs 4 points from A1. In both scenarios, A0 is the better choice. A0 is a dominant strategy.
- For **Player 2**: If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 10 points from A0 vs 9 points from A1. If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 gets 13 points from A0 vs 4 points from A1. In both scenarios, A0 is the better choice for Player 2 as well.

Since A0 is the dominant strategy for both players, the rational outcome is for both to choose A0 with 100% probability. This results in the highest stable payoff for both players given the modified rules.

response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given contracts and determine if they will maximize our points, using a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Game Without Contracts: Standard Payoff Matrix**
    - If both choose A0, we both get 10 points.
    - If you choose A1 while the other picks A0, you get 20, and they get 0.
    - If you choose A0 while the other picks A1, you get 2, and they get 6.
    - If both choose A1, we both get 4 points.

2. **Contracts Breakdown and Impacts**
    - **Contract C1** proposed by Player 1:
        - **Action A0**: +11 points to the player, drawn equally from the other player.
        - **Action A1**: No additional payments.
    - **Contract C2** proposed by Player 2:
        - **Action A0**: +10 points to the player, drawn equally from the other player.
        - **Action A1**: -10 points to the player, given equally to the other player.

3. **Expected Points Analysis with Payment Contracts**
    - We need to determine how each contract affects our potential point strategies and outcomes.

    **Contract C1 Analysis:**
    - **Resulting Payoff Matrix:**
        - (A0, A0): +21 points (10 regular + 11 from the other player) vs -1 point (10 - 11)
        - (A0, A1): 2 - 6 and 6 + 11 = 17 points
        - (A1, A0): -9 (20 - 11 from payment) vs 20
        - (A1, A1): Both get 4 points

    - Under C1, our best strategy adjusts to how we handle action A0 due to the significant +11 points and -11 points.

    **Contract C2 Analysis:**
    - **Resulting Payoff Matrix:**
        - (A0, A0): +20 points (10 + 10) each, net zero intake.
        - (A0, A1): 2 points is equivalent to -8 net from 6 netted for other due to avoiding A1 deduction.
        - (A1, A0): -10 (20 - 10 shared)  from additional 10 paying to the other.
        - (A1, A1): -6 (4 - 10) for mutual deduction.

    - C2 incentivizes action A0 as we benefit net 0 vs point loss/no gains immediately disrupting stake for mutual deduction.

**Approvals:**
- **C1**: It heavily penalizes a player when their opponent picks A0 and incentivizes A0 unilaterally. If everyone non-aggressively narrates to mutually A0 complacency, benefits are seized better.
- **C2**: Resulting total collective higher overall points equity goes to placate anti-A1 from -deductions except when mutual diminish but actions thereby both optimization.

On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we analyze the payoffs for both players in the base game and under the proposed contracts.

### Base Game
1. (P1=A0, P2=A0): (10, 10)
2. (P1=A0, P2=A1): (0, 20)
3. (P1=A1, P2=A0): (6, 2)
4. (P1=A1, P2=A1): (4, 4)

In the base game, A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 2. If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1's best response is A1. The Nash Equilibrium is (A1, A1) with a payoff of (4, 4).

### Contract 1 (C1): A0 gets +11 from the other player
- (A0, A0): Both pay and receive 11, so payoffs remain (10, 10).
- (P1=A0, P2=A1): P1 receives 11 from P2. Payoffs: P1: 0+11=11, P2: 20-11=9.
- (P1=A1, P2=A0): P2 receives 11 from P1. Payoffs: P1: 6-11=-5, P2: 2+11=13.
- (A1, A1): Payoffs remain (4, 4).

In C1, A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players (P2: 10 > 9 and 13 > 4; P1: 10 > -5 and 11 > 4). The Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0) with a payoff of (10, 10).

### Contract 2 (C2): A0 gets +5 from the other player
- (A0, A0): Both pay and receive 5, so payoffs remain (10, 10).
- (P1=A0, P2=A1): P1 receives 5 from P2. Payoffs: P1: 0+5=5, P2: 20-5=15.
- (P1=A1, P2=A0): P2 receives 5 from P1. Payoffs: P1: 6-5=1, P2: 2+5=7.
- (A1, A1): Payoffs remain (4, 4).

In C2, Player 1 has a dominant strategy (A0) because 10 > 1 and 5 > 4. If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2's best response is A1 (15 > 10). The Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A1) with a payoff of (5, 15).

### Approval Decision
- Base Game: Player 2 gets 4.
- C1: Player 2 gets 10.
- C2: Player 2 gets 15.

Player 1's preferences: C1 (10) > C2 (5) > Base (4).
Player 2's preferences: C2 (15) > C1 (10) > Base (4).

If Player 2 approves both {C1, C2} and Player 1 only approves {C1}, C1 wins with 2 votes, and Player 2 gets 10 points. 
If Player 2 only approves {C2} and Player 1 only approves {C1}, both have 1 vote, resulting in a 50/50 chance between C1 and C2. The expected value for Player 2 is (10 + 15) / 2 = 12.5 points.
Since 12.5 > 10, the optimal move for Player 2 is to only approve Contract 2.

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.

response:
Under the original game, Player 1 has a dominant action **A0**. Given that, your best response as Player 2 is **A1**, giving you **20**.

### Contract C1 (reward A0 with +11 taken from the other player)
This makes **A0** strictly better for you regardless of what Player 1 does, so you’d end up playing **A0** and the outcome becomes **(A0, A0)** with you getting **10**. That’s much worse than 20, so **do not approve C1**.

### Contract C2 (penalize A1 with -5 paid to the other player)
Player 1 still has dominant **A0**. Your best response to **A0** becomes **A1**, yielding you **15**. That’s worse than 20, but better than what you’d get under C1 (10). Since the vote is among the proposed contracts, approving only C2 avoids risking C1 being selected.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 10, Other gets 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20, Other gets 0  
- (A0, A1): I get 2, Other gets 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4, Other gets 4

Without any contract, I have a dominant strategy to play A1 (it gives me 20 vs 10 if other plays A0, and 4 vs 2 if other plays A1). Player 1 would also prefer A1 when I play A1. So the Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with both getting 4 points.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract C1

Contract C1: A0 gives +10 (from other player), A1 gives 0.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 10+10-10 = 10, Other gets 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20-10 = 10, Other gets 0+10 = 10
- (A0, A1): I get 2+10 = 12, Other gets 6-10 = -4
- (A1, A1): I get 4, Other gets 4

Now Player 1 has a dominant strategy to play A0 (gets 10 instead of -4 or 4). Given Player 1 plays A0, I'm indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give me 10). The likely outcome is both playing A0, giving me **10 points**.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract C2

Contract C2: A0 gives +3 (from other player), A1 pays 13 (to other player).

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 10+3-3 = 10, Other gets 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20-13-3 = 4, Other gets 0+3+13 = 16
- (A0, A1): I get 2+3+13 = 18, Other gets 6-3-13 = -10
- (A1, A1): I get 4-13+13 = 4, Other gets 4

Now A0 is a dominant strategy for both players! (I get 10 vs 4 if other plays A0, and 18 vs 4 if other plays A1; similar for Player 1). The equilibrium is (A0, A0), giving me **10 points**.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- No contract: 4 points (expected)
- Contract C1: 10 points (expected)
- Contract C2: 10 points (expected)

Both contracts significantly improve my payoff compared to no contract. Since both give me the same expected payoff of 10 points, I should approve both to maximize the chance that at least one contract is implemented.

response:
Step 1: Compute outcomes under each contract (assuming rational play after the contract is selected).

### No contract (baseline)
Player 2 has a strict incentive to play **A1** (it beats A0 no matter what).
- Then Player 1 best-responds with **A1**.
- Outcome: **(A1, A1)** → Player 1 gets **4**.

---

## Contract C1 (reward A0 by taking 11 from the other player)
With 2 players, “drawn equally from the other players” means a direct transfer of 11 from the opponent to the A0-player.

Adjusted payoffs to Player 1:
- (A0,A0): 10 (transfers cancel)
- (A0,A1): 0 + 11 = **11**
- (A1,A0): 6 − 11 = **−5**
- (A1,A1): 4

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1. Symmetrically, **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 2.
- Outcome: **(A0, A0)** → Player 1 gets **10**.

---

## Contract C2 (penalize A1 by paying 5 to the other player)
Adjusted payoffs to Player 1:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A0,A1): 0 + 5 = **5** (since Player 2 paid 5)
- (A1,A0): 6 − 5 = **1**
- (A1,A1): 4 (net transfer cancels)

Here **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1.
Given Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 prefers A1 (15 vs 10).
- Outcome: **(A0, A1)** → Player 1 gets **5**.

---

Step 2: Decide what to approve (anticipating the other player’s incentives)

Player 2’s payoffs:
- Under C1: 10
- Under C2: 15  
So Player 2 will strongly favor **C2**.

If I approve **both**, then (since Player 2 will approve C2) **C2 wins outright**, giving me **5**.

If I approve **only C1** and Player 2 approves **only C2**, then both contracts tie on approvals and the winner is chosen uniformly at random:
- My expected payoff = (10 + 5)/2 = **7.5**, which is better than 5.

So I should **approve C1 only**.

On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 11 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base payoffs from my perspective (Player 2)

Base payoffs before contract:
- (My A0, P1's A0): I get 10
- (My A0, P1's A1): I get 2  
- (My A1, P1's A0): I get 20
- (My A1, P1's A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Apply the contract effects

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 11 points to the other player
- If a player chooses A0, no payment

So the adjusted payoffs for me are:

- (My A0, P1's A0): 10 + 0 (no payments) = **10**
- (My A0, P1's A1): 2 + 11 (I receive P1's payment) = **13**
- (My A1, P1's A0): 20 - 11 (I pay) = **9**
- (My A1, P1's A1): 4 - 11 + 11 (I pay 11, receive 11) = **4**

## Step 3: Analyze my payoff matrix

```
              P1 plays A0    P1 plays A1
My A0:            10             13
My A1:             9              4
```

## Step 4: Determine optimal strategy

Comparing my options:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 gives me 10 vs A1 gives me 9 → **A0 is better**
- If P1 plays A1: A0 gives me 13 vs A1 gives me 4 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** for me - it gives me a higher payoff regardless of what Player 1 does.

Therefore, my optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the game step by step.

### 1. Identify the Initial Game State
First, we analyze the payoff matrix for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2, you) without the contract:
- If P1: A0, P2: A0 $\rightarrow$ (10, 10)
- If P1: A0, P2: A1 $\rightarrow$ (6, 2)
- If P1: A1, P2: A0 $\rightarrow$ (0, 20)
- If P1: A1, P2: A1 $\rightarrow$ (4, 4)

**Dominant Strategy Analysis (No Contract):**
- **Player 1:** If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 0 (A1). If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 6 (A0) vs 4 (A1). P1's dominant strategy is **A0**.
- **Player 2 (You):** If P1 plays A0, you get 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1). If P1 plays A1, you get 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1). Your dominant strategy is **A1**.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** The game results in (A0, A1), where Player 1 receives 6 points and **you (Player 2) receive 2 points**.

### 2. Analyze the Contract
The proposed contract adds 5 points to any player who chooses A0, provided by the other player(s).
- **If (A0, A0):** Both receive 5 and pay 5. Payoffs remain (10, 10).
- **If (A0, A1):** P1 (A0) receives 5 from P2 (A1). P1: 6 + 5 = 11; P2: 2 - 5 = -3.
- **If (A1, A0):** P2 (A0) receives 5 from P1 (A1). P1: 0 - 5 = -5; P2: 20 + 5 = 25.
- **If (A1, A1):** No transfers occur. Payoffs remain (4, 4).

**Dominant Strategy Analysis (With Contract):**
- **Player 1:** If P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs -5 (A1). If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 11 (A0) vs 4 (A1). P1's dominant strategy is **A0**.
- **Player 2 (You):** If P1 plays A0, you get 10 (A0) vs -3 (A1). If P1 plays A1, you get 25 (A0) vs 4 (A1). Your dominant strategy is now **A0**.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** The game results in (A0, A0), where Player 1 receives 10 points and **you (Player 2) receive 10 points**.

### 3. Comparison and Conclusion
- **Without Contract:** You receive **2 points**.
- **With Contract:** You receive **10 points**.

Since the contract aligns the incentives for both players to cooperate (choosing A0), it significantly increases your expected payoff from 2 to 10. Player 1 also benefits (6 to 10), making it highly likely that both players will sign.

response:
1) **Baseline game (no contract)**  
- Player 2 has a dominant action **A1** (it beats A0 no matter what you do).  
- Your best response to A1 is **A1**.  
- So the Nash outcome is **(A1, A1)** giving you **4**.

2) **Contract C1 effects** (A0: +11 received from the other player; A1: 0)  
Compute your modified payoffs (Player 1):
- (A0,A0): 10 (transfers cancel)
- (A0,A1): 0 + 11 = **11**
- (A1,A0): 6 − 11 = **−5**
- (A1,A1): **4**

Best responses:
- If Player 2 plays A0, you prefer A0 (10 > −5).
- If Player 2 plays A1, you prefer A0 (11 > 4).
So you have a **dominant A0**. Similarly Player 2 also ends up with dominant **A0**.  
⇒ Nash outcome **(A0,A0)**, you get **10**.

3) **Contract C2 effects** (A0: +10 received; A1: pay 10 to other)  
Your modified payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 10 (transfers cancel)
- (A0,A1): 0 + 10 = **10**
- (A1,A0): 6 − 10 = **−4**
- (A1,A1): **4**

Best responses:
- Against A0: prefer A0 (10 > −4)
- Against A1: prefer A0 (10 > 4)
So you again have **dominant A0**.  
⇒ Any Nash equilibrium has you playing **A0**, giving you **10**.

4) **Voting decision**  
Both contracts raise your equilibrium payoff from **4 to 10**, and neither creates a downside for you relative to the other. Approving both also reduces the risk that “no good contract” gets selected.

response:
To decide whether or not to sign the contract, let's walk through the steps systematically and analyze the impact of the contract on both players' payoffs.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. **Understanding the Contract:**
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 points, distributed equally to the other player.

#### 2. **Payoff Without Contract:**
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   & A0 & A1 \\
   \hline
   A0 & (10, 10) & (2, 6) \\
   \hline
   A1 & (20, 0) & (4, 4) \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

#### 3. **Payoff With Contract:**

   We need to modify the payoffs based on the contract conditions:
   - If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 pays Player 2 an additional 10 points.
   - If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 2 pays Player 1 an additional 10 points.

   Let's explore each scenario:
   
   - If both choose A0:
     Player 1: 10 - 10 = 0
     Player 2: 10 + 10 = 20
     
   - If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:
     Player 1: 0 + 10 = 10
     Player 2: 20 - 10 = 10
     
   - If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:
     Player 1: 20 - 10 = 10
     Player 2: 0 + 10 = 10
    
   - If both choose A1:
     Player 1: 4 + 10 = 14
     Player 2: 4 - 10 = -6

   Resulting payoffs matrix:
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   & A0 & A1 \\
   \hline
   A0 & (0, 20) & (10, 10) \\
   \hline
   A1 & (10, 10) & (14, -6) \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

#### 4. **Evaluating the Impact:**

From Player 2's perspective:
- A0 (opponent A0): 20
- A0 (opponent A1): 10
- A1 (opponent A0): 10
- A1 (opponent A1): -6

Choosing A0 dominates A1 in every scenario. Hence, the contract encourages cooperation and mutual choice of A0.

#### 5. **Decision to Sign the Contract:**

Given the strategic advantage and induced fair cooperation:

{"sign": true}
```

response:
To solve this problem, let's systematically analyze the payoff matrix and the impact of the contract. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff without a Contract
First, consider the matrix without the contract:

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (20, 0)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (2, 6)       | (4, 4)       |

- If both choose A0, both receive 10 points.
- If you (Player 2) choose A1 and the other player (Player 1) chooses A0, you receive 20 points while Player 1 gets 0.
- If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1, you get 2 points while Player 1 gets 6.
- If both choose A1, both get 4 points.

### Step 2: Incorporate the Contract
The contract changes the point distribution significantly:

- Choosing A0 gives you an additional 10 points deducted from the opponent.
- Choosing A1 obligates you to give 10 points to the opponent.

So, the modified payoffs look like this:

|               | Player 2: A0                   | Player 2: A1                       |
|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (0, 20)                           | (10, 10)                           |
| **Player 1: A1** | (-8, 16)                          | (-6, 14)                           |

The payoffs are updated because:
- If both choose A0: You gain 10 points but give 10, making net (0, 20).
- If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: You get 20 - 10 = 10, Player 1 gets 0 + 10 = 10.
- If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: You get 2 + 10 = 12, Player 1 gets 6 - 10 = -4.
- If both choose A1: You get 4 - 10 = -6, Player 1 gets 4 + 10 = 14.

### Step 3: Determine Optimal Strategy
From the modified payoffs, as Player 2 (you):
- If Player 1 chooses A0, choosing A0 gives you 20 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1, choosing A0 gives you a negative outcome of -8 points.

Player 1 also considers these same points when making decisions. Sequential rationality implies that knowing the dynamics of the added points can decipher the optimal strategy pair.

### Final Outcome
The strategic footprint suggests Player 1 would favor their payoffs:
- Player 1 choosing A0 maximizes zero loss potential to 10 points with you choosing A1.

Suppose we wanted to:
- Ensure Player 2 doesn't get heavily negative outcomes: logically counter-responsive to pressing consistent exploitation maximizes expected returns via A0.

### Step 4: Generate JSON
Given no part of the game exhibits a deterministic "best" move:

Reflectively balance probability:
  ```json
  {"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
  ```

For practical non-dominant strategy:
Integrates optionality and preserves generic competitive stance.

In conclusion:
```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

response:
To choose my optimal probability distribution, I compare my expected points from **A0** vs **A1** against each possible action of the other player:

1. **If Player 1 plays A0:**
   - If I play **A0** → I get **10**
   - If I play **A1** → I get **20**
   So **A1 is better**.

2. **If Player 1 plays A1:**
   - If I play **A0** → I get **2**
   - If I play **A1** → I get **4**
   So **A1 is better** again.

Since **A1 gives me a higher payoff no matter what Player 1 does**, **A1 strictly dominates A0**, so I should put all probability on **A1**.

response:
Both proposed contracts are identical: choosing **A0** gives you **+11** funded by the other player (a 2-player transfer), and choosing **A1** gives **0**.

Under either contract, Player 1’s payoffs become:

- (A0, A0): \(10 + 11 - 11 = 10\)
- (A0, A1): \(0 + 11 = 11\)
- (A1, A0): \(6 - 11 = -5\)
- (A1, A1): \(4\)

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1 (and symmetrically for Player 2), making (A0, A0) the unique equilibrium with payoff **10** each.

Because **both contracts are identical** and there is **no “no contract” option** (if approvals are all 0, one contract is still chosen at random), my approvals don’t change what gets implemented in any meaningful way. I’ll approve both.

response:
Let's go step by step to analyze the decision-making process and determine which contracts you (as Player 2) should approve.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)

You are **Player 2**. The game matrix (from your perspective, i.e., row = your choice, column = other player’s choice):

| Your Action \ Other’s Action | A0 (Other) | A1 (Other) |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | 10         | 2          |
| **A1**                        | 20         | 4          |

So for you (Player 2), the payoffs are:

- If you pick A0:
  - If other picks A0 → 10
  - If other picks A1 → 2
- If you pick A1:
  - If other picks A0 → 20
  - If other picks A1 → 4

Now consider best responses.

#### Best Response for You (Player 2):
- Suppose other plays A0: you get 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → best to play A1
- Suppose other plays A1: you get 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → best to play A1

So regardless of what the other player does, **your best response is A1**.

So as Player 2, your dominant strategy is **A1**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Contracts

Contracts add **side payments** that depend on your chosen action. The payment is drawn **equally from the other player**.

> Key: These are **transfer payments** that change your total payoff.

Let’s denote:
- Your total payoff = base payoff from game + extra payment from contract (if applicable)

But note: the payment is drawn from the **other player**, so:
- If you choose A0 → you get +10 (C1) or +11 (C2), and the other player loses that amount.
- If you choose A1 → no payment to you, and no cost.

So the **net transfer**:
- When you choose A0: you gain 10 or 11 (depending on contract), and the other player loses that amount.
- When you choose A1: no change.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Contract from your (Player 2) Perspective

You’re interested in **maximizing your total expected points**, taking into account:
- The base game payoff
- The additional payment from the contract (if any)

But since the contract only adds a payment for choosing A0 (and it’s taken from the other player), it **only affects your payoff when you play A0**.

Recall: In the base game, **you are better off playing A1**, regardless of the other player's choice.

Now consider: Does either contract change your incentive to play A0?

Let’s analyze both contracts.

---

#### Contract C1: "If you choose A0, get +10 from the other player. A1: nothing."

Your payoffs (total, including contract):

| Your Action | Other’s Action | Base Payoff | Contract Bonus | Total |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| A0          | A0             | 10          | +10            | **20** |
| A0          | A1             | 2           | +10            | **12** |
| A1          | A0             | 20          | 0              | **20** |
| A1          | A1             | 4           | 0              | **4** |

So your total payoffs:
- If you play A0:
  - vs A0: 20
  - vs A1: 12
- If you play A1:
  - vs A0: 20
  - vs A1: 4

Now, best response:
- If other plays A0: you get 20 (A0) or 20 (A1) → indifferent
- If other plays A1: you get 12 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → better to play A0

So **if you think other might play A1**, you prefer A0.

But in the base game, your dominant strategy was A1, and we can see that the contract **changes this** by making A0 more attractive when the other plays A1.

But wait: the **key point** is: you care about **your point total**, not just dominance. But **you cannot control the other player’s choice** — you must consider their strategy.

Can you predict what the other player will do?

Let’s think about **Player 1’s incentives**.

But here’s the twist: **you are Player 2**, and you’re deciding whether to **approve** a contract.

Approval is a vote — you want the **contract that maximizes your expected points**.

But the **contract only takes effect if it gets approved by both players (via approval voting)**.

The policy is: **The winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So to maximize your **expected payoff**, you need to consider:
- Which contracts you approve
- Which contracts the other player might approve (unknown)
- But you don’t know the other player’s preferences — so assume you have to reason about **your own best interest** based on how the contract affects your payoffs, assuming rational play.

But note: **You are the only one with preferences for which contracts to approve**. The goal is to **maximize your total points received**.

So you should approve contracts that **increase your expected payoff**, assuming all players act rationally.

But let’s analyze **what each contract does**.

---

### Evaluate Contract C1 (by Player 1):

- You (Player 2) get +10 if you play A0 (drawn from Player 1)
- No change for A1

Your total payoff if you play A0 → 10 + 10 = 20 (vs A0), 2 + 10 = 12 (vs A1)
Your payoff if A1 → 20 (vs A0), 4 (vs A1)

So your new preferences:
- Against A0: A0 and A1 both give 20 → indifferent
- Against A1: A0 gives 12, A1 gives 4 → you prefer A0

So if Player 1 plays A1, you prefer A0; if Player 1 plays A0, you’re indifferent.

Now consider Player 1’s incentives.

In the **base game**, what would Player 1 do?

Player 1’s payoffs (from their perspective):

| Their Action | Other’s Action | Base Payoff |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| A0           | A0             | 10          |
| A0           | A1             | 6           |
| A1           | A0             | 0           |
| A1           | A1             | 4           |

So:
- If Player 1 plays A0: gets 10 (vs A0) or 6 (vs A1)
- If A1: 0 (vs A0) or 4 (vs A1)

So best response:
- If other plays A0 → A0 (10) > A1 (0) → prefer A0
- If other plays A1 → A0 (6) > A1 (4) → prefer A0

So Player 1 has **dominant strategy A0**.

They will play A0 no matter what.

So **if no contract**, Player 1 → A0, you → A1 → outcome: (A1, A0): you get 20, they get 0.

Now, with **C1** in place:
- You get +10 if you choose A0
- But Player 1 still wants to play A0 (i.e., their dominant strategy remains A0), since:
  - If they play A0 → get 10 (if you A0) or 6 (if you A1), plus payment only depends on **their** action
  - But C1 says: *if a player chooses A0, they receive +10 from other player*

So Player 1 gets +10 if they play A0 → so their payoff:
- If they play A0:
  - vs your A0: 10 (base) +10 (contract) = 20
  - vs your A1: 6 +10 = 16
- If they play A1:
  - vs your A0: 0 +0 = 0
  - vs your A1: 4 +0 = 4

So Player 1’s best response:
- If you play A0: they get 20 (A0) vs 0 (A1) → play A0
- If you play A1: they get 16 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → play A0

So yes, **Player 1 still plays A0**.

Now, what about **you**?

You now face:
- If you play A0: get 20 (vs A0) or 12 (vs A1)
- If you play A1: get 20 (vs A0) or 4 (vs A1)

But Player 1 is playing A0 for sure.

So if you play A0: you get 20
If you play A1: you get 20

So indifferent.

But you might prefer to **play A0** to get 20 (same as A1), but maybe prefer A0 for fun? But we care about points.

Same payoff.

So expected payoff for you: 20 (regardless of action, since other player plays A0)

But wait: since you get same payoff, you can play either.

But **remarkably**, with C1 in place, you can get 20 no matter what.

Can you get more?

Wait — what if **you play A0** and they play A0 → you get 20 (base) +10 (contract) = 30?

Wait, wait — let's double-check.

Hold on — **who receives the payment?**

From contract (C1):
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you (Player 2)** choose A0, you get +10, paid by Player 1.

If **Player 1** chooses A0, they get +10, paid by you.

So **both players get +10 if they play A0**, and the other player pays it.

So **the net effect is that if both play A0**, you get:
- Base: 10
- Contract: +10 (because you played A0) → but **you pay 10** because Player 1 played A0 → so net: 10 +10 -10 = **10**

Wait — this is critical.

---

### Important: Clarify the Payment Mechanism

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- Every time **a player** chooses A0, they get +10
- But that +10 is **drawn from the other player**

So if **both players choose A0**:
- You (Player 2) choose A0 → you get +10 from Player 1
- Player 1 chooses A0 → they get +10 from you
- So you pay 10 to Player 1, receive 10 from Player 1 → net 0
- Base payoff: 10
- So **your total = 10**

If you play A0, Player 1 plays A0:
- You get: base 10 + (+10 from P1) + (-10 to P1) = 10
- So **no net gain**.

Similarly, Player 1: base 10 +10 (from you) -10 (to you) = 10.

Only **if one plays A0 and the other A1**, the one who played A0 gets +10, and the one who played A1 gets -10.

Let’s recast.

### Correct Payoffs with Contracts (Net Effect)

Each contract adds transfers based on actions.

#### Contract C1:
- If you play A0 → +10, paid by other player
- If other plays A0 → +10, paid by you

So net:
- If (A0, A0): you get +10 from other, pay 10 to other → net 0. Base = 10 → total = 10
- If (A0, A1): you play A0 → get +10 from other, other plays A1 → no cost to you from contract → but you pay nothing (since other didn't play A0) → you get +10. Base = 2 → total = 12
- If (A1, A0): you play A1 → no gain, but other plays A0 → you pay 10 → so net -10. Base = 20 → total = 10
- If (A1, A1): neither plays A0 → no payment → base = 4 → total = 4

Similarly for C2: the payment is +11 instead of +10.

So let’s build full payoff matrices under each contract.

---

### Contract C1: A0 → +10 (from other), A1 → 0

Your total payoffs:

| Your \ Other | A0              | A1              |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **A0**       | 10 +10 -10 = **10** | 2 +10 = **12** |
| **A1**       | 20 -10 = **10**   | 4               |

So your payoffs (C1):
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 12
- (A1, A0): 10
- (A1, A1): 4

Now, best response:
- If other plays A0: → you get 10 (A0) vs 10 (A1) → indifferent
- If other plays A1: → you get 12 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So if other plays A1, you play A0

But what is other player (Player 1)’s best response?

Player 1’s payoffs (C1):

| Their \ Your | A0              | A1              |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **A0**       | 10 +10 -10 = **10** | 6 +10 = **16** |
| **A1**       | 0 -10 = **-10**   | 4               |

So Player 1’s payoffs:
- If you play A0: they get 10 (A0) or -10 (A1) → prefer A0
- If you play A1: 16 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So **Player 1 plays A0 regardless**.

So outcome: (A0, A0) or (A1, A0), but since Player 1 plays A0, you face:

- If you play A0 → 10
- If you play A1 → 10

So you get 10 either way.

But **without contract**, in base game:
- Player 1 plays A0 (dominant)
- You play A1 → get 20
→ But now, **you get only 10**!

So C1 **drastically reduces your payoff**, from 20 to 10.

So you **do not want C1** — it harms you.

Now, why?

Because when you play A1, Player 1 plays A0 → you pay 10 to them → so you lose 10.

Previously, no transfer → you got 20.

Now you get only 10.

So you **should not approve** C1.

---

### Contract C2: A0 → +11 (from other), A1 → 0

Now compute your payoffs:

| Your \ Other | A0              | A1              |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **A0**       | 10 +11 -11 = **10** | 2 +11 = **13** |
| **A1**       | 20 -11 = **9**    | 4               |

So you get:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 13
- (A1, A0): 9
- (A1, A1): 4

Best response:
- If other plays A0: you get 10 (A0) vs 9 (A1) → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: 13 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So **you play A0 regardless**.

Now, what does Player 1 do?

Player 1’s payoffs (C2):

| Their \ Your | A0              | A1              |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **A0**       | 10 +11 -11 = **10** | 6 +11 = **17** |
| **A1**       | 0 -11 = **-11**   | 4               |

So:
- If you play A0: 10 (A0) vs -11 (A1) → prefer A0
- If you play A1: 17 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So Player 1 plays A0.

Now, since Player 1 plays A0, your best response is A0 (because you get 10 vs 9).

So outcome: (A0, A0)

Your total payoff: 10

Compare:
- Without contract: you get 20 (A1 vs A0)
- With C2: only 10

So even worse.

So **you do not want C2 either** — both contracts reduce your payoff from 20 to 10.

But wait — what if you could choose to play A0? But in C2, you get 10 vs 9 if you play A1, so you do.

But you get less than before.

Alternatively, is there **any scenario where you get more than 20**?

No. Maximum base is 20.

In both contracts, when (A1, A0) happens, you pay 10 or 11 → so you get 10 or 9.

So **both contracts hurt you**.

But wait — is there a way that **you can get higher than 20**?

Only if you play A0 and the other plays A1.

But in C1: (A0, A1): you get 12
In C2: 13

But to get that, you need Player 1 to play A1.

But **both Player 1 and you are incentivized to play A0** under C1 and C2.

In fact, in both contracts, **Player 1 has dominant strategy A0**.

So the final outcome is always (A0, A0) — both play A0.

You get:
- C1: 10
- C2: 10

Even worse: with C2, you get **10**, same as C1.

But in base game: you get **20**

So **both contracts make you worse off**.

Therefore, you should **not approve** either contract.

But wait — could you approve a contract that makes the other player's dominant strategy change?

Wait — in base game, Player 1’s dominant strategy was A0.

In C1 and C2, it’s still A0.

But what if a contract made them want to play A1?

But neither contract does that.

But behind the scenes: you are the one deciding whether to approve.

If you **do not approve** a contract, it cannot be chosen.

The process:
- Contracts are proposed
- You vote on each: approve or not
- The winning contract is **selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**

So if you approve **only** C1, and Player 1 approves both, then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 → C1 wins.

But if you approve **neither**, then only contracts with 1 approval (C1 and C2) have 1 each → random pick between them → you get 10 with probability 1.

But if you **approve both**, then both have 2 approvals (assuming Player 1 approves both), so one is picked at random → you get 10 either way.

But **you do not gain anything**.

But you want to **maximize your points**, not just avoid losing.

So strategy:
- If you **approve no contracts**, then contracts with **1 approval** (C1, C2) win with equal probability → you get 10.
- If you **approve both**, and they are both approved, then one is picked at random → you still get 10.
- If you **approve only one**, say C1, then C1 wins (if Player 1 also approves it) → you get 10.

So in **all cases**, if the contract is implemented, you get **10**.

But in **no contract**, you get 20.

But is “no contract” an option?

The question says: “the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.”

So **if all contracts are rejected**, then no contract is implemented.

But the problem doesn’t say that explicitly.

But logically, **if zero contracts are approved by anyone**, then no contract is applied.

So you should consider: **what if no contract is passed?**

Then the game is played under base rules.

As Player 2:
- You play A1 (dominant)
- Player 1 plays A0 (dominant)
- You get 20 points.

That’s **better** than 10.

So you want to avoid contracts being approved.

But can you prevent contracts?

You can vote **not** to approve them.

If you **approve no contracts**, then:
- C1: approved by Player 1 only → 1 approval
- C2: approved by Player 1 only → 1 approval
- Max approvals = 1
- So one of C1 or C2 is chosen randomly → you get 10

But if **you approve neither**, and Player 1 approves both, then:
- C1: 1 approval (P1 only)
- C2: 1 approval (P1 only)
→ Max = 1 → random one → you get 10

But **if you approve one of them, say C1**, and Player 1 approves both, then:
- C1: 2 approvals (you and P1)
- C2: 1 approval (P1 only)
→ C1 wins → you get 10

Same as before.

So **no matter what**, if any contract is passed, you get 10.

But if **no contract is passed**, you get 20.

So to get 20, you need **no contract to win**.

But how can that happen?

Only if **no contract has the maximum number of approvals** — but since contracts are approved by players, and if **you reject both**, then:
- C1: approved only by P1 → 1
- C2: approved only by P1 → 1
→ Both have 1 → max is 1 → one is chosen uniformly at random → contract is applied.

So **even if you reject both**, if Player 1 approves both, then **one contract is still applied**, and you get 10.

Ah — that’s critical.

So unless **Player 1 also rejects both**, a contract will be applied.

But you don’t control Player 1.

So you cannot guarantee that no contract is applied — **Player 1 might approve both**.

But you can **choose to reject both**, reducing your **own** approvals, but not preventing the contract from being selected.

In fact, the **only way no contract is applied is if no contract is approved by anyone**.

But the problem doesn't say that.

It says: "the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if **some contracts have approvals**, the game proceeds with one of them.

But if **no contract is approved**, then no contract is applied.

But is that possible?

Well, presumably, Player 1 may accept or reject.

But for you, you must **decide** which contracts to approve, knowing that:

- If you approve a contract, it increases its approval count
- If you don’t, it doesn’t
- Player 1's approval is unknown

But since you want to **maximize your expected payoff**, and **you don’t know how Player 1 votes**, you must assume the worst-case or make a strategic guess.

But perhaps we can assume **rational self-interest**, so Player 1 will approve contracts that benefit them.

Let’s analyze Player 1’s incentive for each contract.

---

### Player 1’s preferences:

In base game: Player 1 plays A0, gets 10 (vs your A0) or 6 (vs your A1)

Now, with **C1**: if Player 1 plays A0, they get +10 from you (if you play A1), but they pay 10 to you if you play A0.

But in C1:
- If Player 1 plays A0 and you play A0: 10 (base) +10 (from you) -10 (to you) = 10
- If Player 1 plays A0 and you play A1: 6 +10 = 16
- If A1: 0 (if you A0) or 4 (if you A1)

So Player 1’s best response is A0 (as before).

But with the contract, they get:
- If you play A0: 10
- If you play A1: 16

So **Player 1 prefers you to play A1**, but they can’t force it.

But the greatest gain: **if you play A1, they get 16**, whereas base was 6.

So **C1 increases their payoff if you play A1**.

But in reality, **you will not play A1** under C1 or C2 — in both cases, you play A0.

So for Player 1:
- In C1: if they play A0, and you play A0 → they get 10
- Base: 10 → same
- But if you play A1 → they get 16, but you won’t.

So **their payoff in outcome (A0, A0) is 10**, same as base.

They get **no benefit**.

Similarly in C2: same outcome → they get 10.

But in base, they could get 10 (vs your A0) or 6 (vs your A1)

But now, if you play A0, they get 10.

So **same or worse**.

But in C1: if you played A1, they’d get 16, but you won’t.

So **Player 1 has no incentive to approve C1 or C2** — they get **no better payoff**, and in fact, they might lose if you play A0, but since you get 10 anyway, same as base.

In C1: they get 10 in outcome (A0, A0), same as base.

But **they cannot get more than 10**, whereas in base, if you played A1, they’d get 6.

So **no benefit**, and **no risk**.

So Player 1 might be **indifferent**.

But perhaps they approve to gain potential.

But since they **can’t control your action**, and in equilibrium you both play A0, they get 10, same as before.

So **no benefit to them**.

So Player 1 will **not approve any contract**, or might do so randomly.

But to be safe, assume **Player 1 approves neither**.

Then:
- C1: 0 approvals (you reject) → 0
- C2: 0 approvals (you reject) → 0
- Max approvals = 0
- **No contract is applied**

Then you play base game → you get 20.

If you approve **any contract**, and Player 1 approves it, then it is applied → you get 10.

But if Player 1 does **not** approve it, then you may be the only one approving — so max approvals = 1 → contract is applied if it's the only one with 1.

But if you approve C1, and Player 1 approves C1, then C1 has 2, C2 has 0 → C1 wins → you get 10.

But if Player 1 rejects C1, but you approve it, then C1 has 1 approval, C2 has 0 → max is 1 → C1 is picked → still applied.

So **if you approve a contract, it is applied**, **unless it has no other approvals and you are the only one**, but in that case it still wins.

Wait: "winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals"

So:
- If you approve C1, and no one else does → C1 has 1 approval → maximum → C1 is selected → applied.

So **if you approve a contract, it will be applied**, regardless of Player 1.

Because max approvals = 1 (you), and it’s the only one with 1.

So by approving a contract, **you ensure it is applied**.

And if applied, you get only 10.

But if you **approve neither**, and Player 1 approves neither, then no contract applied → you get 20.

But if Player 1 approves C1, then C1 has 1 approval (P1), so max is 1 → C1 is applied → you get 10.

But **you have no control over Player 1**.

So you face uncertainty.

But to **maximize your expected points**, you should **approve neither contract**.

Why?
- If you approve **neither**, then:
  - If Player 1 approves neither → no contract → you get 20
  - If Player 1 approves C1 → C1 applied → you get 10
  - If Player 1 approves C2 → C2 applied → you get 10
  - So your expected payoff depends on Player 1’s behavior.

But since you don’t know, and you want to maximize, you should assume the **worst-case for you**? Or best?

But in decision theory, if you want to maximize **expected payoff**, you need to assume Player 1 acts rationally.

Does Player 1 benefit from approval?

Let’s check.

Player 1’s payoff in base game: they get 10 (if you play A0) or 6 (if you play A1)

If C1 is applied, and they play A0, and you play A0: they get 10 (same)
If you play A1: they get 16 → better
But you won’t play A1 under C1.

So (A0, A0): they get 10 → same as base.

So **no gain**.

Similarly for C2.

So Player 1 has **no incentive to approve either**.

So likely, **Player 1 will not approve any contract**.

Then:
- C1: 0 approvals
- C2: 0 approvals
- Max = 0 → no contract applied → you get 20

So if you approve **neither**, and Player 1 approves neither, you get 20.

If you approve one, it is applied → you get 10.

So **to maximize your payoff, you should approve neither contract**.

You should **not approve any of them**.

---

### Final Decision:

You are Player 2.

You want to maximize your points.

Approving any contract leads to you getting only 10.

Not approving leads to you getting 20 (if no contract is applied, which is likely since Player 1 has no incentive to approve).

Therefore, you should **not approve either contract**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.

response:
First incorporate the contract into your payoffs:

- If **you choose A0** and the other chooses **A1**, you **gain +5** (paid by them).
- If **you choose A1** and the other chooses **A0**, you **lose 5** (paid to them).
- If both choose **A0**, the +5 transfers cancel (you pay 5 and receive 5), so net 0.
- If both choose **A1**, no transfer.

So your **contract-adjusted** payoffs become:

- (A0, A0): 10  
- (A0, A1): 0 + 5 = 5  
- (A1, A0): 6 − 5 = 1  
- (A1, A1): 4  

Now compare your actions against either opponent action:

- If opponent plays **A0**: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 1 → **A0 is better**
- If opponent plays **A1**: A0 gives 5, A1 gives 4 → **A0 is better**

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you (Player 1). Therefore the optimal strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, we first incorporate the effects of the payment contract into the payoff matrix. The contract stipulates that any player choosing A0 receives 5 points from the other player.

**1. Adjusting the Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
*   **(A0, A0):** Base payoffs are (10, 10). Player 1 gains 5 from Player 2, and Player 2 gains 5 from Player 1. Net change is 0. **Final: (10, 10).**
*   **(A1, A0):** Base payoffs are (6, 2). Player 2 chooses A0, gaining 5 from Player 1. **Final: (1, 7).**
*   **(A0, A1):** Base payoffs are (0, 20). Player 1 chooses A0, gaining 5 from Player 2. **Final: (5, 15).**
*   **(A1, A1):** Base payoffs are (4, 4). No players choose A0. **Final: (4, 4).**

**2. Identifying Player 1's Dominant Strategy:**
*   If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 compares A0 (10 points) and A1 (1 point). A0 is better.
*   If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 compares A0 (5 points) and A1 (4 points). A0 is better.
Thus, Player 1 has a dominant strategy to choose **A0**.

**3. Identifying Player 2's Best Response:**
Since Player 1 is expected to play A0 based on their dominant strategy:
*   If Player 2 plays A0, they receive 10 points.
*   If Player 2 plays A1, they receive 15 points.
Since 15 > 10, the best response for Player 2 is to choose **A1**.

This leads to a Nash Equilibrium at (A0, A1), where Player 2 maximizes their payoff by choosing A1 with 100% probability.

response:
Both contracts change incentives so that **A0 becomes a strictly dominant action for both players**, leading to the Nash equilibrium **(A0, A0)** in either case.

- **Baseline (no contract):** Player 2 has a dominant strategy **A1**, so equilibrium is **(A1, A1)** with my payoff **4**.
- **Contract C1:** If I play **A0**, I get +11 from the other player. This makes **A0 strictly better than A1** for me regardless of what they do; same for them. Equilibrium becomes **(A0, A0)** with my payoff **10**.
- **Contract C2:** Playing **A1** is heavily penalized (pay 13), and **A0** is rewarded (+3). Again **A0 strictly dominates** for both players. Equilibrium becomes **(A0, A0)** with my payoff **10**.

Since **both C1 and C2 improve my equilibrium payoff from 4 to 10**, I approve both.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoffs WITHOUT the contract

From my perspective as Player 2:
- (My A0, Their A0): I get 10
- (My A1, Their A0): I get 20
- (My A0, Their A1): I get 2
- (My A1, Their A1): I get 4

Without the contract:
- If Player 1 plays A0, I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If Player 1 plays A1, I prefer A1 (4 > 2)
- **A1 is my dominant strategy**

Similarly, Player 1 has A1 as their dominant strategy.

**Nash equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → both get 4 points**

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- +3 points if you choose A0 (paid by opponent)
- -13 points if you choose A1 (paid to opponent)

My payoffs with contract:
- (My A0, Their A0): 10 + 3 - 3 = **10**
- (My A1, Their A0): 20 - 13 - 3 = **4**
- (My A0, Their A1): 2 + 3 + 13 = **18**
- (My A1, Their A1): 4 - 13 + 13 = **4**

With the contract:
- If Player 1 plays A0, I prefer A0 (10 > 4)
- If Player 1 plays A1, I prefer A0 (18 > 4)
- **A0 becomes my dominant strategy**

Similarly, the contract makes A0 dominant for Player 1.

**Nash equilibrium with contract: (A0, A0) → both get 10 points**

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: 4 points expected
- **With contract**: 10 points expected

The contract transforms an inefficient equilibrium into an efficient one, benefiting both players.

## Conclusion

Since the contract increases my expected payoff from 4 to 10 points, and Player 1 should rationally sign for the same reason, I should sign.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To make an optimal decision in this game, we need to carefully consider both the payoff matrix and the effect of the additional contract that has been signed by both players.

### Base Game Payoff Analysis:

The basic payoffs, without considering the contract, are as follows:

- If both choose A0, both get 10 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, you get 20 points and they get 0 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you get 2 points and they get 6 points.
- If both choose A1, both get 4 points.

### Additional Contract Effect:

The contract introduces an additional gain or penalty based on the following rules:

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Thus, the net payoffs considering the contract are:

- A0 and A0: You get 20 points (10 base + 10 contract), other player gets 0 points.
- A1 and A0: You get 10 points (20 base - 10 contract), other player gets 10 points.
- A0 and A1: You get 12 points (2 base + 10 contract), other player gets -4 points (6 base - 10 contract).
- A1 and A1: Both get -6 points (4 base - 10 contract).

### Analysis:

From the standpoint of maximizing your own points, let's analyze the outcomes:

- A0 is clearly dominant when the other player selects A0, netting you 20 points.
- If you select A1 when the other player selects A0, you net only 10 points.
- If you both choose A1, both players incur a negative point total of -6 each.
- If you choose A0 and the other player selects A1, you net 12 points while the other player ends up with -4 points.

Given the heavy penalty associated with both players choosing A1 (each getting -6), even though it is a symmetric and Pareto sub-optimal outcome, choosing A0 when the other player selects A1 yields higher points (12 versus any positive number).

Therefore, A0 is the safer and more optimal strategy.

### Final Decision:

Taking into account both the payoff matrix and the contract, a prudent strategy would be to heavily prefer A0. Based on that analysis, a strong probability distribution choice would be:

- Assign a high percentage to A0 to mitigate the risk and ensure at least some positive outcome.
- Assign a small percentage to A1 to maintain some level of unpredictability.

Thus, a reasonable split might be:

```json
{"A0": 90, "A1": 10}
```

This distribution reflects a strong preference for A0 while retaining a slight possibility of A1 to possibly catch the other player off-guard or to adapt to their strategy if they deviate from a pure A0 strategy.

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

We are Player 2 (the one making the decision in this scenario). The game is symmetric in structure, but we are in Player 2’s perspective.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's action → row, Player 2's action → column):

|               | P1: A0        | P1: A1        |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **P2: A0**    | (10, 10)      | (2, 6)        |
| **P2: A1**    | (20, 0)       | (4, 4)        |

Let’s analyze the best responses for Player 2:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 10 for A0, 20 for A1 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 2 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefers A1

So **A1 is a dominant strategy** for Player 2 **in the base game**, regardless of what Player 1 does.

Similarly, for Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) or 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 6 (A0) or 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So Player 1 has no dominant strategy.

But because A1 is dominant for Player 2, they will play A1 for sure in equilibrium (if no contract).

Now, what is the Nash equilibrium without contract?

- P2 chooses A1 (dominant)
- P1: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 6 for A0, 4 for A1 → so P1 prefers A0

So NE: (P1: A0, P2: A1) → Payoffs: (20, 0)

But wait — P2 is getting only 0! That seems bad.

Wait: double-check:

- P1: A0, P2: A1 → P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0

Is that correct?

Looking back:

> - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.

Yes. So when P2 (you) chooses A1 and P1 chooses A0, you get 20.

But earlier I said in the matrix:

|               | P1: A0        | P1: A1        |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **P2: A0**    | (10, 10)      | (2, 6)        |
| **P2: A1**    | (20, 0)       | (4, 4)        |

Yes, so (A1, A0) → (20, 0): P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0.

Now, if P2 plays A1, what will P1 do?

P1 gets:
- 0 if A0, 4 if A1 → so P1 prefers A1

Ah! So P1 would **not** play A0 if P2 plays A1. P1 will play A1 to get 4 instead of 0.

So if P2 plays A1, P1 best response is A1 → then payoffs: (4, 4)

If P2 plays A0:
- P1 gets 10 (A0) or 6 (A1) → P1 prefers A0 → outcome: (10,10)

But P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 for A0, 20 for A1 → so P2 prefers A1

So dominant strategy for P2: A1

But if P2 plays A1, P1 plays A1 (since 4 > 0)

So NE: (A1, A1) → (4,4)

Alternatively, is (A0, A0) a NE?

- P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefers A0
- P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → so prefers A1

So P2 would deviate → not a NE.

So **only NE is (A1, A1)** → payoffs (4,4)

So without contract, P2 expects 4 points.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

The contract is:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+11 points**, drawn equally from the other player(s).
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

This is a **transfer** system: when a player chooses A0, they gain 11 points, and the other player **loses 11 points**.

> "drawn equally from the other players" — there are two players, so each other player loses 11 points?

Wait: "drawn equally from the other players" → since there is one other player, so the other player loses 11 points.

So the net effect of playing A0 is:
- Player gains +11
- Opponent loses 11

So the contract **subsidizes playing A0** and penalizes A1 for opponents.

But here's the key: **The contract is only active if all players sign it.**

You are Player 2, and the contract was proposed by Player 2. You must decide whether to sign.

But both players must sign for it to be active.

So, if you don't sign, the contract is not active.

You are deciding: **Should you sign?**

So we need to ask: **Will signing lead to better expected payoff than not signing?**

But — **you cannot force the other player to sign**. They could refuse.

But the contract becomes active **only if all players sign**.

So your decision affects whether the contract is active.

We must consider the possibility that **Player 1 might reject the contract**, especially if they don't benefit.

But we don’t know their decision yet. We need to think strategically: **Given that both players are rational and self-interested, what will happen?**

Let’s suppose **you (P2) sign the contract**.

Then the contract is **only active if Player 1 also signs**.

So we need to think: **Will Player 1 sign?**

Player 1 will only sign if **they expect to gain from signing** — i.e., if their expected payoff with the contract is higher than without.

But **without the contract**, the NE is (A1, A1) → (4,4)

If the contract is in place, we need to analyze the new game.

So let’s analyze the **new game under contract**.

---

### **Step 3: Game with Contract (Assuming it’s Active)**

In the contract game, whenever a player chooses A0, they get **+11**, and the other player gets **-11**.

So the new payoffs are:

Let’s build the modified matrix.

Original payoffs + contract effects.

We define the **total payoff** = base payoff + contract adjustment.

Note: the contract adjustment depends on **your action**.

If you choose A0 → you get +11, your opponent gets -11

If you choose A1 → no contract adjustment.

So let’s compute payoff for P2 in each scenario under contract.

#### Case 1: P1: A0, P2: A0
- Base: (10,10)
- P1 chose A0 → P1 gets +11 → 10 + 11 = 21
- P2 chose A0 → P2 gets +11 → 10 + 11 = 21
- But wait: contract says: “if a player chooses A0, they receive +11, drawn equally from the other player”

“Drawn equally from the other players” → only one other player → so other player loses 11.

So yes:
- P1 gets +11
- P2 gets +11
- But P2’s +11 comes from P1, and P1’s +11 comes from P2.

So it's **double transfer**: each A0 player gets +11, and gives -11 to the other.

So net: both get +11 from contract.

But that would mean both gain 11?

Wait — is that allowed?

The wording: "drawn equally from the other players"

So if both play A0, then:
- P1 gets 11, and loses 11 to P2? No — he gains 11, and the other player (P2) loses 11.

Similarly, P2 gains 11, and P1 loses 11.

So P1 loses 11 to P2, and gains 11 from contract? That doesn’t make sense unless the contract is funded externally.

Ah — this is critical.

If both play A0, then:
- P1 chooses A0 → P1 gains +11
- P2 chooses A0 → P2 gains +11
- But the "drawn equally from the other players" → so P1's +11 is taken from P2, and P2's +11 is taken from P1 → so net: P1 gets +11 -11 = 0, P2 gets +11 -11 = 0

Same as if no contract?

Wait — that would mean the contract **only affects cross terms**? Or is it:

Is the +11 for choosing A0 funded by the other player?

Let’s read carefully:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So: “drawn equally from the other players” → so if you choose A0, you get +11, and that +11 comes from the other player(s) → so other player loses 11.

Now, if **both** players choose A0, then:
- P1: chooses A0 → gains +11 → taken from P2 → P2 loses 11
- P2: chooses A0 → gains +11 → taken from P1 → P1 loses 11

So net:
- P1: base 10 +11 (from contract) -11 (to P2) = 10
- P2: base 10 +11 -11 = 10

So no change.

But if only one chooses A0:

- P1: A0, P2: A1
- P1: gets +11 (contract), P2: gets nothing (chose A1)
- But the +11 is “drawn equally from the other players” → other player is P2 → so P2 loses 11
- So P1: base 20 +11 = 31
- P2: base 0 (from A1) -11 = -11

Wait — that can’t be right? The base payoff is already given, but now contract adds transfer?

Yes — so under contract, the full payoff is base + contract effect.

So for each player, their total payoff = base payoff + (contract adjustment)

Contract adjustment:
- If you play A0: you get +11
- If you play A1: 0
- But this +11 is funded by the other player(s): each other player loses 11

So if only one player plays A0:
- That player gains +11
- The other loses 11

If both play A0:
- Each gains +11, but each loses 11 (to the other) → net 0 from contract

If both play A1:
- No contract adjustment → 0

Now let’s build the **full payoff matrix under contract**.

Let’s define:

- P1 action → row
- P2 action → column

#### (1) P1: A0, P2: A0
- Base: (10,10)
- Contract: both A0 → each gains +11, each loses 11 → net 0
- Total: (10, 10)

#### (2) P1: A0, P2: A1
- Base: (20, 0) — wait: P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1? Wait no:
  - “If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.”

So "you" is P2 → so if P2 chooses A1, P1 chooses A0 → P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0.

So base: (0, 20)

Now contract:
- P1: A0 → P1 gains +11
- P2: A1 → P2 gains 0
- But the +11 for P1 is drawn from P2 — so P2 loses 11

So total:
- P1: 0 (base) +11 = 11
- P2: 20 (base) -11 = 9

#### (3) P1: A1, P2: A0
- Base: P1 chose A1, P2 chose A0 → you (P2) get 2, P1 gets 6
- So base: (6, 2)

Contract:
- P2: A0 → P2 gains +11
- P1: A1 → P1 gains 0
- P2's +11 comes from P1 → P1 loses 11

So:
- P1: 6 -11 = -5
- P2: 2 +11 = 13

#### (4) P1: A1, P2: A1
- Base: (4,4)
- Contract: both A1 → no adjustment
- Total: (4,4)

Now let’s write the **matrix under contract**:

|               | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (10, 10)      | (11, 9)       |
| **P1: A1**    | (-5, 13)      | (4, 4)        |

Wait — in (P1:A1, P2:A0): P1 gets -5? That’s very low.

But P1 will want to avoid that.

Now analyze best responses.

#### Player 1’s perspective:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 10 (A0) or -5 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 9 (A0) or 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **A0 is dominant strategy for P1** under contract.

#### Player 2’s perspective (you):

- If P1 plays A0:
  - You get 10 (A0) or 9 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - You get 13 (A0) or 4 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is dominant for P2 under contract too**.

Therefore, in the contract game, **(A0, A0)** is the unique Nash equilibrium → payoffs: (10, 10)

Wait: from the matrix:

- P1: A0, P2: A0 → (10,10)

Yes.

So under the contract, **both players play A0**, get **10 each**.

But without contract, in NE, they play (A1,A1) and get 4 each.

So **under contract, P2 gets 10 instead of 4** — a **net gain of 6 points**.

But — this is **only if the contract is active**.

And contract is only active **if both sign**.

So if you sign, and P1 also signs → you get 10.

If P1 refuses → contract inactive → you get only 4 (from (A1,A1) NE).

But will P1 sign the contract?

Let’s check: **If P1 signs, what do they get?**

Under contract, in NE, P1 gets 10.

Without contract, P1 gets 4.

So P1 **would gain 6** from signing.

So P1 has **incentive to sign**.

Therefore, **if you sign, P1 will also sign** → contract activates → you get 10.

If you don’t sign → contract never activates → game is as base game → NE is (A1,A1) → you get 4.

So your payoff:
- If you sign: you get 10 (since P1 will cooperate)
- If you don’t sign: you get 4

So **you should sign**.

But wait — is there a risk?

Could P1 **not** sign even though they benefit?

Only if P1 thinks you won’t sign → but they should anticipate that you will sign, because you gain from it.

Let’s think about **credible commitment**.

You are the proposer.

You must decide to sign or not.

If you **sign**, and they sign → you get 10.

If you **don’t sign**, contract doesn’t activate → you get 4.

You **gain 6** from signing.

P1 knows that if they sign, they get 10 (in the contract game), versus 4 otherwise → so they also gain.

So both players have **strictly higher payoff** from signing and cooperating.

So the contract creates a **mutual gain** and a **new equilibrium** where both play A0 and get 10.

And since both benefit from signing, **both will sign**.

Therefore, **signing is safe and profitable**.

---

### **Conclusion**

- Without contract: you get 4
- With contract: you get 10 (if both sign, which they will)
- So signing is strictly better.

✅ Sign the contract.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
First incorporate the contract into *your* payoffs:

- If you play **A0**, you get **+10** extra (taken from the other player).
- If you play **A1**, you pay **-10** extra (given to the other player).

So your adjusted payoffs become:

- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 = **20**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 10 = **10**
- (A1, A0): 6 − 10 = **−4**
- (A1, A1): 4 − 10 = **−6**

Now compare your actions against any probability the other player uses:

Let \(q\) = probability the other player plays A0.

- Expected payoff if you play **A0**: \(20q + 10(1-q) = 10 + 10q\)
- Expected payoff if you play **A1**: \((-4)q + (-6)(1-q) = -6 + 2q\)

Difference:
\((10 + 10q) - (-6 + 2q) = 16 + 8q > 0\) for all \(q \in [0,1]\).

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you under this contract. Therefore the optimal strategy is to put all probability on A0.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P2
response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without Contracts**

We are playing a **simultaneous-move game** with two actions: A0 and A1.

As Player 2, our payoff matrix (with rows = our choice, columns = opponent's choice) is:

|                | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **You A0**     | 10          | 2           |
| **You A1**     | 20          | 4           |

So the full payoff matrix (for us, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Best Responses Without Contracts**

Let’s look at best responses.

Suppose opponent plays A0:
- You get 10 for A0, 20 for A1 → best response: **A1**

Suppose opponent plays A1:
- You get 2 for A0, 4 for A1 → best response: **A1**

So **A1 dominates A0 for Player 2**, regardless of what the opponent does.

Thus, **in the absence of contracts**, rational Player 2 will always choose A1.

But let’s check: what would the opponent (Player 1) do?

Payoff for Player 1:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

Best response for Player 1:
- If you play A0: 10 vs 0 → prefers A0
- If you play A1: 6 vs 4 → prefers A0
So **A0 dominates for Player 1 too**.

Thus, without contracts, **(A1, A0)** is the only Nash equilibrium: Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 plays A0.

Outcome: You (Player 2) get **20 points**.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contracts**

Two contracts are proposed:

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
- If a player chooses A0, they get +11 points (drawn equally from the other player)
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payment

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
- Exactly the same: +11 if A0, nothing if A1

So both contracts are **identical in structure**.

But note:
- The **payment is drawn equally from the other player(s)**. So if you choose A0, you get +11, and the other player pays 11 total — split evenly between the two players, so **each pays 5.5** to the player who chose A0.

Wait — let's clarify:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you** choose A0, you gain 11, and that 11 is **taken equally from the other player(s)**.

There are two players, so if you choose A0, the other player pays **5.5** to you.
- So you gain +11, other loses 5.5 → net transfer of 5.5 from opponent to you.

Similarly, if the other player chooses A0, they gain +11, and you pay 5.5.

So this **benefits the player who chooses A0 by 11**, and **costs the other player 5.5** (since the 11 is split equally between the two players: the one who chooses A0 receives 11, the other pays 5.5 toward that).

Wait: "drawn equally from the other players" — so the total 11 comes from the **other player**, and is **split equally among them**.

Since there’s only one other player, that 11 is taken entirely from the other player.

Let me rephrase:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

- "Drawn equally from the other players": if there's one other player, "equally" just means the entire 11 is taken from that one player.
- So: If you choose A0 → you get +11, opponent loses 11 → net for you: +11, for opponent: -11.

Wait — that would be **not** "equally from the other players" — that’s fully from the other player.

But "drawn equally from the other players" implies that if there were multiple other players, the payment would be split. But here, only two players.

So in a two-player game, "drawn equally from the other players" → means **the other player pays the full 11**.

So for example:
- You play A0 → you get +11, opponent pays -11 → net: you +11, opponent -11

Similarly:
- Opponent plays A0 → opponent gets +11, you pay -11

So the **net effect** of the contract is:
- **+11 to the player who chooses A0**
- **-11 to the other player**

Because the 11 is drawn entirely (equally) from the other single player.

So **the contract imposes a transfer of 11 points from the non-A0 player to the A0 player, if that player chooses A0**.

Now, let’s analyze how this changes the **effective payoffs**.

---

### **Step 4: Expected Payoffs Under Contract**

Let’s suppose the contract is **in effect**, and both players choose actions with some probabilities.

But we are to decide **whether to approve** the contract.

We want to **maximize our expected total points**.

But note: the contract will only take effect **if it gets approval** — and the **winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So even if we like a contract, we must decide whether to approve it **based on how it affects our payoff**, considering **what happens if multiple contracts are approved**.

---

### **Step 5: Contract C1 and C2 Are Identical**

Both contracts are **identical** in wording:
- A0 earns +11, drawn equally from the other player.

So C1 and C2 are **the same contract**, just proposed by different players.

So effectively, there are **two identical copies** of the same contract.

---

### **Step 6: Do We Want This Contract?**

Let’s analyze the **effect on payoffs** under the contract.

#### **Without any contract:**
As we found earlier, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A1, A0), with:
- You (Player 2): 20 points
- Opponent (Player 1): 0 points

So you get 20.

#### **With contract in place:**

Let’s consider the **effective payoffs under the contract**.

The original payoffs are modified by the contract.

Let’s define the **total payoff** from the game + the contract.

So for Player 2 (you), your total payoff is:
- Base payoff from game
- Plus: +11 if you choose A0, -11 if opponent chooses A0 (since you pay 11 if they pick A0)

Wait — no.

The contract says: **if you choose A0, you get +11, paid by the other player**.

So:
- Your total payoff = base game payoff + [11 if you choose A0] + [if opponent chooses A0, they pay you 11, so you get +11 from contract]

Wait — no: the **contract payment** is **only based on your choice**.

Let’s re-read:  
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.

So **only** if **they** choose A0, they get +11.

So:
- If you choose A0 → you get +11 (from contract)
- If opponent chooses A0 → opponent gets +11 (from contract), so you pay -11

So your **contract-based** gain is:
- +11 if you choose A0
- -11 if opponent chooses A0

Similarly, for the opponent:
- +11 if they choose A0
- -11 if you choose A0

So your **total expected payoff** with contract is:

> Base payoff from game + 11 × (1 if you play A0) - 11 × (1 if opponent plays A0)

So the contract creates **an incentive to play A0** (you gain 11) but **penalizes the opponent for playing A0** (you lose 11).

But crucially, **the contract only applies if approved**.

---

### **Step 7: Strategic Effect of the Contract**

Let’s compute **new payoffs under contract**.

New payoff matrix for Player 2 (you), with contract:

|                | Opponent A0 | Opponent A1 |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **You A0**     | (10 + 11) - 11 = 10 | (2 + 11) - 0 = 13 |
| **You A1**     | (20 + 0) - 11 = 9 | (4 + 0) - 0 = 4 |

Let’s break it down:

- (A0, A0): you get base 10, +11 (because you played A0), -11 (because opponent played A0) → net 10
- (A0, A1): you get base 2, +11 (you played A0), 0 (opponent played A1) → net 13
- (A1, A0): you get base 20, 0 (you played A1), -11 (opponent played A0) → net 9
- (A1, A1): you get base 4, 0, 0 → net 4

So your new game matrix:

|                | Opp A0 | Opp A1 |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| **You A0**     | 10     | 13     |
| **You A1**     | 9      | 4      |

Now, best responses:

- If opponent plays A0:
  - You: A0 → 10, A1 → 9 → best: **A0**

- If opponent plays A1:
  - You: A0 → 13, A1 → 4 → best: **A0**

So **A0 is dominant** for you under the contract.

Similarly, let's check opponent's incentives.

Opponent's base payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

Under contract:
- Opponent gets +11 if they play A0
- You pay -11 if they play A0 (but you only pay if they play A0)

So opponent's new payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 11 - 11 = 10
- (A1, A0): 0 + 0 - 11 = -11
- (A0, A1): 6 + 11 - 0 = 17
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4

So opponent’s matrix:

|                | You A0 | You A1 |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| **Opp A0**     | 10     | -11    |
| **Opp A1**     | 17     | 4      |

Best response:
- If you play A0: Opp gets 10 vs 17 → best: A1
- If you play A1: Opp gets -11 vs 4 → best: A1

So **A1 dominates for opponent**.

Thus, under the contract:
- You (Player 2) want to play A0 (dominant)
- Opponent wants to play A1 (dominant)

So **equilibrium: (A0, A1)**, outcome:

- You: 2 (base) + 11 (contract, because you played A0) = **13**
- Opponent: 6 (base) + 11 (contract, because they played A0? no) → they played A1 → no contract gain → 6
But wait: they played A1 → so they get 0 from contract. But you played A0 → so they pay -11

So opponent’s total: base 6 + 0 (no A0) -11 (you played A0) = **-5**

So total: you get 13, opponent gets -5

So **you get 13 points under contract**, and the opponent gets -5.

But wait — compare with **without contract**:
- You get 20 points (from (A1, A0))
- Opponent gets 0

So under contract: **you get only 13**, which is **less than 20**

So **you are worse off under the contract**.

Therefore, **you should NOT approve the contract**, because it reduces your expected payoff from 20 to 13.

But wait — is that the **only possible outcome**?

We assumed both players act rationally under the contract. And we found that under the contract, the **only equilibrium** is (A0, A1), giving you 13.

So yes.

But what if the opponent **does not** play A1? Could they play A0?

From above, opponent’s best response is always A1 — even if you play A0, they get 10 if they play A0 (10) vs 17 if they play A1 → so A1 better.

So no, opponent **will not play A0**.

So the only outcome is (A0, A1) → you get 13.

But **without contract**, you get 20.

So you are **worse off** with the contract.

Therefore, **you should not approve the contract**.

---

### **Step 8: What about Approval Voting?**

The winning contract is selected **uniformly at random** from those with **maximum number of approvals**.

You must decide whether to approve each contract.

There are two contracts: C1 (by Player 1), C2 (by Player 2) — **both identical**.

If you approve **both**, and no one else approves any, then both are approved → max approvals = 1 → random choice → you get 13.

If you approve **only one**, and others don’t, same.

But suppose you **don’t approve either**, and others do — but we are only deciding based on **your** preferences.

But since both contracts are identical, and you are **worse off** under either, you should **reject both**.

Even if both contracts are approved, you still get 13, which is worse than 20.

So **you have no incentive to approve either**.

---

### **Step 9: Could there be a coordination benefit?**

Suppose the contract makes A0 appealing to you, but only if opponent also plays A0.

But we’ve seen that the opponent, under the contract, **has no incentive to play A0**, since it gives them -11 if you play A0.

So they will play A1.

So no coordination to (A0, A0).

And (A0, A0) under contract gives you: 10 (base) +11 (A0) -11 (opponent A0) = 10.

Worse than 13.

(A1, A0): you get 20 (base), but opponent plays A0 → so you pay -11 → 9

Even worse.

So **no**.

---

### **Step 10: Final Decision**

- Under contract: you get **13**
- Without contract: you get **20**
- So **contract hurts you**

Therefore, you should **not approve** either contract.

Even though they are identical, you should reject both.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.

response:
Step 1: Incorporate the contract into Player 1’s payoff.  
- If I choose **A0**, I get **+5** from Player 2.  
- If Player 2 chooses **A0**, I pay **5** to Player 2.  
So my adjusted payoff = (base payoff) + 5·1{I play A0} − 5·1{P2 plays A0}.

Step 2: Compute my adjusted payoffs for each outcome.

- (A0, A0): 10 + 5 − 5 = **10**  
- (A0, A1): 0 + 5 − 0 = **5**  
- (A1, A0): 6 + 0 − 5 = **1**  
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 − 0 = **4**

Step 3: Best response check.  
- If Player 2 plays A0: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives 1 → **A0 better**  
- If Player 2 plays A1: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives 4 → **A0 better**  

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**, meaning I should play A0 with probability 1.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this game theory problem, I need to analyze how each contract affects the equilibrium and my expected payoff.

## Step 1: Understand the Original Game (No Contract)

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
```
                P1: A0      P1: A1
P2: A0         (10,10)     (2,6)
P2: A1         (20,0)      (4,4)
```
Where format is (P2 payoff, P1 payoff)

Analyzing best responses:
- For me (P2): If P1 plays A0, I prefer A1 (20 > 10). If P1 plays A1, I prefer A1 (4 > 2).
  - So A1 is my dominant strategy
- For P1: Given I'll play A1, they prefer A1 (4 > 0)

**Nash Equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Modified payoffs:
```
                P1: A0      P1: A1
P2: A0         (10,10)     (13,-5)
P2: A1         (9,11)      (4,4)
```

Checking best responses:
- For me: If P1 plays A0, I prefer A0 (10 > 9). If P1 plays A1, I prefer A0 (13 > 4).
  - A0 is now my dominant strategy!
- For P1: If I play A0, they prefer A0 (10 > -5). If I play A1, they prefer A0 (11 > 4).
  - A0 is P1's dominant strategy!

**Nash Equilibrium with C1: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Modified payoffs:
```
                P1: A0      P1: A1
P2: A0         (10,10)     (18,-10)
P2: A1         (4,16)      (4,4)
```

Checking best responses:
- For me: If P1 plays A0, I prefer A0 (10 > 4). If P1 plays A1, I prefer A0 (18 > 4).
  - A0 is my dominant strategy!
- For P1: If I play A0, they prefer A0 (10 > -10). If I play A1, they prefer A0 (16 > 4).
  - A0 is P1's dominant strategy!

**Nash Equilibrium with C2: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Decision

Both contracts:
- Transform the game so (A0, A0) becomes the Nash equilibrium
- Give me 10 points in equilibrium vs. 4 points without any contract
- Make A0 a dominant strategy for both players, ensuring stability

Since both contracts significantly improve my payoff from 4 to 10 points, and both achieve the same equilibrium outcome, I should approve both to maximize the probability that at least one beneficial contract is selected.

response:
Let's solve this step by step, carefully accounting for all the rules, payoffs, and the contract mechanism.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)

We are in a simultaneous-move game where both players choose a probability distribution over actions A0 and A1. You are **Player 2**, and the other player is **Player 1**.

Base payoffs (Player 2's payoff):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0        | A1        |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**              | 10        | 2         |
| **A1**              | 20        | 4         |

So the base payoff matrix for Player 2 is:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract mechanism

> **Contract (selected by Player 2):**
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 11 points**, drawn equally from the other player(s).
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

Since there are only two players, if you (Player 2) choose A0, you receive +11 points, and **Player 1 loses 11 points** (because it's drawn from the other player).

Similarly, if Player 1 chooses A0, they get +11 points, and you (Player 2) lose 11 points.

> 💡 This is a **transfer** based on action choice: A0 choice = +11 for self, -11 for opponent.

So we must **include this contract effect in the final payoff**.

---

### Step 3: Rewrite the full payoff matrix (with contract)

Let’s define the total payoff to **Player 2** in all four outcomes.

Note: The contract is applied **after** action is chosen, and the player gets +11 for choosing A0, and the opponent loses 11 if they chose A0.

So for each outcome, we compute:
- Base payoff (from original game)
- Add +11 **if Player 2 chose A0**
- Subtract 11 **if Player 1 chose A0**

Let’s tabulate:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1 chooses A0) | A1 (P1 chooses A1) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **A0** (P2 chooses A0) | Base: 10<br>+11 (P2 chose A0)<br>−11 (P1 chose A0)<br>**Total: 10 + 11 − 11 = 10** | Base: 2<br>+11 (P2 chose A0)<br>−0 (P1 chose A1)<br>**Total: 2 + 11 = 13** |
| **A1** (P2 chooses A1) | Base: 20<br>+0 (P2 chose A1)<br>−11 (P1 chose A0)<br>**Total: 20 − 11 = 9** | Base: 4<br>+0 (P2 chose A1)<br>−0 (P1 chose A1)<br>**Total: 4** |

So the **new payoff matrix for Player 2** is:

| P2 \ P1 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **A0** | 10       | 13       |
| **A1** | 9        | 4        |

---

### Step 4: Think about optimal mixed strategy

Now we model this as a standard two-player game, with Player 2 trying to maximize expected payoff, and Player 1 also trying to maximize their own payoff.

But **Player 2 is the one who proposed the contract**, so **we are not sure what Player 1 will do**. However, since Player 1 is rational, they will also try to maximize their own payoff under the same contract.

So we need to find the **Nash equilibrium** of this new game, because both players are rational and will play optimally.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ = probability that **Player 1** chooses A0 (we are Player 2, so we're choosing our strategy).
- Let $ q $ = probability that **Player 2** chooses A0.

We will compute best responses and find the equilibrium.

But note: **You are choosing your strategy (q), knowing that your opponent will also play optimally.**

We’ll compute the expected payoff for Player 2, as a function of $ q $, assuming Player 1 plays $ p $, and find where Player 2’s best response is.

But we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** — a pair $ (p, q) $ such that:
- Given $ p $, $ q $ maximizes Player 2’s expected payoff.
- Given $ q $, $ p $ maximizes Player 1’s expected payoff.

Let’s now compute the **payoff for Player 1** as well, because Player 1 will choose their strategy to maximize their own expected payoff — which also includes the contract.

---

### Step 5: Compute Player 1’s payoff under the contract

Player 1’s base payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

Now apply the contract:
- If Player 1 chooses A0 → +11 (total)
- If Player 1 chooses A1 → 0
- If Player 2 chooses A0 → Player 1 loses 11

So total payoffs for Player 1:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **A0** (P2) | Base: 10<br>+11 (P1 chose A0)<br>−11 (P2 chose A0)<br>**10 + 11 − 11 = 10** | Base: 6<br>+0 (P1 chose A1)<br>−11 (P2 chose A0)<br>**6 − 11 = -5** |
| **A1** (P2) | Base: 0<br>+11 (P1 chose A0)<br>−0 (P2 chose A1)<br>**0 + 11 = 11** | Base: 4<br>+0 (P1 chose A1)<br>−0 (P2 chose A1)<br>**4** |

So Player 1's payoff matrix:

| P2 \ P1 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **A0** | 10       | -5       |
| **A1** | 11       | 4        |

---

### Step 6: Find the Nash equilibrium

We now have:

**Player 2 (you) payoff:**
| P1\P2 | A0 (q) | A1 (1−q) |
|-------|--------|----------|
| A0 (p)| 10     | 13       |
| A1 (1−p)| 9    | 4        |

**Player 1 (opponent) payoff:**
| P2\P1 | A0 (p) | A1 (1−p) |
|-------|--------|----------|
| A0 (q)| 10     | -5       |
| A1 (1−q)| 11   | 4        |

We look for mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let’s suppose Player 1 uses probability $ p $ for A0, and Player 2 uses $ q $ for A0.

We find best responses.

---

#### Player 2’s Best Response to Player 1’s $ p $

Player 2’s expected payoff if choosing A0:
$ E(A0) = p \cdot 10 + (1-p) \cdot 13 = 10p + 13 - 13p = 13 - 3p $

Player 2’s expected payoff if choosing A1:
$ E(A1) = p \cdot 9 + (1-p) \cdot 4 = 9p + 4 - 4p = 4 + 5p $

Player 2 will choose A0 if $ 13 - 3p > 4 + 5p $ → $ 9 > 8p $ → $ p < 9/8 = 1.125 $ → always true since $ p \leq 1 $. But more carefully: $ 13 - 3p > 4 + 5p $ → $ 9 > 8p $ → $ p < 9/8 $ → always true.

Wait: $ 13 - 3p > 4 + 5p $ → $ 9 > 8p $ → $ p < 1.125 $. Since $ p \leq 1 $, this is **always true**.

But let's check at $ p = 1 $:  
- E(A0) = 10  
- E(A1) = 9 → A0 better  
At $ p = 0 $:  
- E(A0) = 13  
- E(A1) = 4 → A0 better

Is there any $ p $ where A1 is better?

Set equal: $ 13 - 3p = 4 + 5p $ → $ 9 = 8p $ → $ p = 9/8 = 1.125 $ → not possible.

So **for all $ p \in [0,1] $, $ 13 - 3p > 4 + 5p $**?

Let’s test $ p = 1.125 $ is not in range. So in $ [0,1] $, the left side is always larger.

Thus: **Player 2’s best response is always to play A0 (q = 1)** — never A1.

Because A0 gives higher expected payoff for **any** $ p $ that Player 1 might play.

So Player 2 should always play A0?

Wait — let’s verify:

- At $ p = 0 $: A0 gives 13, A1 gives 4 → A0 better
- At $ p = 1 $: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 9 → A0 still better
- Is there any $ p $ where A1 is better?

Set $ 13 - 3p < 4 + 5p $ → $ 9 < 8p $ → $ p > 1.125 $ → not possible.

So yes: for all $ p \in [0,1] $, $ E(A0) > E(A1) $.

Therefore: **Best response for Player 2 is always to pick A0 (q = 100%)**.

Now, suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability 1 (q = 1).

What should Player 1 do?

---

#### Player 1’s Best Response to Player 2 playing A0 (q = 1)

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If Player 1 chooses A0: payoff = 10 (from matrix, when P2 plays A0)
- If Player 1 chooses A1: payoff = -5

So clearly, **Player 1 prefers A0** over A1 (10 > -5).

So Player 1’s best response is to play A0 with probability 1.

Now check: if both play A0, is this a Nash equilibrium?

- Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 responds with A0 → yes
- Player 2: if Player 1 plays A0, does Player 2 prefer A0 or A1? A0 gives 10, A1 gives 9 → prefers A0
- Player 1: if Player 2 plays A0, A0 gives 10, A1 gives -5 → prefers A0

Yes! **(A0, A0)** is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

Moreover, since **Player 2’s best response is always A0, regardless of Player 1’s action**, the only stable equilibrium is when Player 2 plays A0 with certainty.

Player 1 will also play A0 because it maximizes their payoff when Player 2 plays A0.

So the **rational outcome** is: **both players play A0**.

Thus, **Player 2 should play A0 with 100% probability**.

But wait — let’s double-check whether there could be a mixed equilibrium.

Suppose Player 1 mixes between A0 and A1. But Player 2 always prefers A0, so Player 2 plays A0 for sure.

Then Player 1, seeing that Player 2 plays A0, will choose A0 (10 > -5), so Player 1 plays A0 for sure.

So the only equilibrium is (A0, A0).

Player 2's expected payoff at equilibrium: **10** (from matrix).

Is there any scenario where Player 2 could do better in expectation?

Suppose Player 2 considers playing A1.

But A1 gives:
- If Player 1 plays A0: 9 → worse than 10
- If Player 1 plays A1: 4 → worse than 13 (if Player 2 plays A0)

So no, A1 is strictly dominated.

Therefore, **Player 2 should play A0 with 100% probability**.

---

### Final Answer:

You are Player 2, so set your probability distribution to:

- A0: 100%
- A1: 0%

This is the optimal strategy under the contract and rational play by both parties.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the basic payoffs from my perspective (Player 2)

Basic game payoffs for me:
- (My A0, Other A0): I get 10
- (My A1, Other A0): I get 20  
- (My A0, Other A1): I get 2
- (My A1, Other A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Apply the contract effects

The contract states:
- Choosing A0: receive +3 points (from other player)
- Choosing A1: pay -13 points (to other player)

This applies to both players, so:
- When I choose A0: I get +3 (other pays -3)
- When I choose A1: I pay -13 (other gets +13)
- When other chooses A0: I pay -3 (other gets +3)
- When other chooses A1: I get +13 (other pays -13)

## Step 3: Calculate my modified payoffs

- (My A0, Other A0): 10 + 3 - 3 = **10 points**
- (My A1, Other A0): 20 - 13 - 3 = **4 points**
- (My A0, Other A1): 2 + 3 + 13 = **18 points**
- (My A1, Other A1): 4 - 13 + 13 = **4 points**

My payoff matrix:
```
              Other plays A0    Other plays A1
I play A0:         10               18
I play A1:          4                4
```

## Step 4: Analyze my optimal strategy

Comparing my options:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (10 > 4)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (18 > 4)

**A0 strictly dominates A1 for me!** Regardless of what the other player does, I always get more points by choosing A0.

## Step 5: Verify this is rational

Even if I consider mixed strategies, my expected payoff with A0 is always higher than A1 for any probability distribution the other player might choose. Therefore, I should play A0 with 100% probability.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the original game (without contract)

Original payoff matrix (Me as Player 2, Player 1):
```
           P1: A0      P1: A1
Me: A0    (10, 10)    (2, 6)
Me: A1    (20, 0)     (4, 4)
```

**My dominant strategy without contract:**
- If P1 plays A0: I get 20 with A1 vs 10 with A0 → prefer A1
- If P1 plays A1: I get 4 with A1 vs 2 with A0 → prefer A1

A1 strictly dominates A0 for me.

**P1's best response:** Given I'll play A1, P1 gets 0 with A0 vs 4 with A1 → P1 prefers A1

**Nash equilibrium without contract:** Both play A1, getting (4, 4)

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs with the contract

Contract modifications:
- Playing A0: +3 points (from other player)
- Playing A1: -13 points (to other player)

New payoff matrix:
```
           P1: A0      P1: A1
Me: A0    (10, 10)    (18, -10)
Me: A1    (4, 16)     (4, 4)
```

Calculations:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 3 - 3 = 10 for each
- (A0, A1): Me: 2 + 3 + 13 = 18, P1: 6 - 3 - 13 = -10
- (A1, A0): Me: 20 - 13 - 3 = 4, P1: 0 + 13 + 3 = 16
- (A1, A1): 4 - 13 + 13 = 4 for each

## Step 3: Analyze the game with contract

**My strategy with contract:**
- If P1 plays A0: I get 10 with A0 vs 4 with A1 → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: I get 18 with A0 vs 4 with A1 → prefer A0

A0 now strictly dominates A1 for me!

**P1's strategy with contract:**
- If I play A0: P1 gets 10 with A0 vs -10 with A1 → prefer A0
- If I play A1: P1 gets 16 with A0 vs 4 with A1 → prefer A0

A0 strictly dominates A1 for P1 too!

**Nash equilibrium with contract:** Both play A0, getting (10, 10)

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** I expect 4 points
- **With contract:** I expect 10 points

The contract transforms the game from a prisoner's dilemma (where mutual defection is the equilibrium) into a coordination game where cooperation (A0, A0) becomes the dominant strategy equilibrium. Both players benefit significantly.

**Conclusion:** I should sign the contract.

response:
First incorporate the contract payments into your final payoff.

Because there are 2 players:
- If you choose **A0**, you **gain +3** from the other player.
- If you choose **A1**, you **pay 13** to the other player (so **-13** for you).
Also, the other player’s choice affects you:
- If the other chooses **A0**, they take **+3** from you (so **-3** for you).
- If the other chooses **A1**, they pay **13** to you (so **+13** for you).

Now compute your total payoff in each outcome:

- **(A0, A0):** base 10 +3 (you chose A0) −3 (they chose A0) = **10**
- **(A0, A1):** base 0 +3 (you chose A0) +13 (they chose A1) = **16**
- **(A1, A0):** base 6 −13 (you chose A1) −3 (they chose A0) = **−10**
- **(A1, A1):** base 4 −13 (you chose A1) +13 (they chose A1) = **4**

Compare your actions given the other player’s action:
- If they play **A0**: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives −10 → prefer **A0**
- If they play **A1**: A0 gives 16 vs A1 gives 4 → prefer **A0**

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**. The maximizing strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Calculate Modified Payoffs with Contract

Let me first compute my payoffs (Player 2) after incorporating the contract:

**Base payoffs:**
- (Me: A0, Opponent: A0): I get 10
- (Me: A0, Opponent: A1): I get 2
- (Me: A1, Opponent: A0): I get 20
- (Me: A1, Opponent: A1): I get 4

**Contract effects:**
- Choosing A0: receive +3 from opponent
- Choosing A1: pay -13 to opponent

**Modified payoffs for me:**

1. **(A0, A0)**: 10 + 3 (I get for A0) - 3 (opponent gets for A0) = **10**

2. **(A0, A1)**: 2 + 3 (I get for A0) + 13 (opponent pays for A1) = **18**

3. **(A1, A0)**: 20 - 13 (I pay for A1) - 3 (opponent gets for A0) = **4**

4. **(A1, A1)**: 4 - 13 (I pay for A1) + 13 (opponent pays for A1) = **4**

## Step 2: Create My Payoff Matrix

```
                Opponent A0    Opponent A1
My A0               10             18
My A1                4              4
```

## Step 3: Determine Optimal Strategy

Comparing my options:
- **If opponent plays A0:** A0 gives me 10, A1 gives me 4 → A0 is better
- **If opponent plays A1:** A0 gives me 18, A1 gives me 4 → A0 is better

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - no matter what the opponent does, A0 always gives me a higher payoff.

## Step 4: Verify with Expected Value

For any mixed strategy where opponent plays A0 with probability p:
- Expected payoff from A0: 10p + 18(1-p) = 18 - 8p
- Expected payoff from A1: 4p + 4(1-p) = 4

Since 18 - 8p ≥ 10 > 4 for all p ∈ [0,1], A0 is always superior.

## Conclusion

Since A0 strictly dominates A1, my optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let’s go through this step by step, carefully analyzing the game before and after the contract, and then decide whether to sign it.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

We are Player 2 (the other player is Player 1). The payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2) is:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | (10,10)| (2,6)  |
| **P2: A1**    | (20,0) | (4,4)  |

So:
- If both choose A0 → (10,10)
- P2: A0, P1: A1 → (2,6)
- P2: A1, P1: A0 → (20,0)
- Both choose A1 → (4,4)

We are to choose a mixed strategy (probability distribution over A0 and A1) to maximize our expected payoff, assuming Player 1 is rational and will also choose optimally.

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the base game.

---

### **Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium (Base Game)**

Let:
- P1 choose A0 with probability p
- P2 choose A0 with probability q

Compute expected payoffs for each player.

#### **P2’s expected payoff:**

- If P2 chooses A0:  
  = p×10 + (1−p)×2 = 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2

- If P2 chooses A1:  
  = p×20 + (1−p)×4 = 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

P2 will be indifferent between A0 and A1 when:
8p + 2 = 16p + 4  
⇒ 8p = -2  
⇒ p = -0.25 → not possible (probability can’t be negative)

Since the coefficient of p is higher in A1 (16 > 8), for **any** p ≥ 0, A1 gives higher payoff.

But wait — that suggests P2 **always prefers A1**, regardless of p?

Wait — check again:  
If p = 0 (P1 always plays A1):  
- A0 gives 2  
- A1 gives 4 → better

If p = 1 (P1 always plays A0):  
- A0 gives 10  
- A1 gives 20 → still A1 better?

Wait — no: A1 gives 20 when P1 plays A0? Yes!

So when P1 plays A0, P2 gets 20 by playing A1? Yes, that’s right.

But if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 4 for A1, 2 for A0 → A1 is better.

So **regardless of P1’s strategy**, **A1 dominates A0 for Player 2**? Let’s verify.

Compare:
- A0 payoff: 8p + 2
- A1 payoff: 16p + 4

Difference (A1 − A0) = (16p + 4) − (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 > 0 for all p ≥ 0

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2**.

Therefore, **Player 2 will always play A1** in equilibrium.

Now consider Player 1.

#### **P1’s expected payoff**

- If P1 chooses A0:  
  = q×10 + (1−q)×20 = 10q + 20(1−q) = 10q + 20 − 20q = 20 − 10q

- If P1 chooses A1:  
  = q×6 + (1−q)×4 = 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

P1 is indifferent when:
20 − 10q = 2q + 4  
⇒ 20 − 4 = 12q  
⇒ 16 = 12q  
⇒ q = 16/12 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 → not possible

But again, let's see which is better:

If q = 1 (P2 always A0), P1 gets:
- A0: 10
- A1: 6 → so A0 better

If q = 0 (P2 always A1), P1 gets:
- A0: 20
- A1: 4 → A0 better

So A0 is always better than A1 for P1?

Wait: A0 gives 20 − 10q  
A1 gives 2q + 4

Difference (A0 − A1) = (20 − 10q) − (2q + 4) = 16 − 12q

This is positive when q < 16/12 ≈ 1.33 → which is always true.

So A0 strictly dominates A1 for P1.

Therefore, **P1 will always play A0**.

**So in the base game, the unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium is:**

- P1 plays A0
- P2 plays A1
- Payoff: (20, 0)

But wait: is this rational? P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0.

But can P1 ever do better?

If P1 plays A1, and P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4, which is worse than 20.

So yes, P1 has no incentive to deviate.

P2: if P2 plays A0 while P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10, which is worse than 20.

So P2 has no incentive to deviate.

**Thus, NE is: (A0, A1), payoff (20, 0)**

So **as Player 2, your expected payoff in the base game (with rational opponent) is 20 points**.

---

### **Step 3: Now consider the contract**

The contract:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other player(s)

Note: "drawn equally from the other players" → so if both players choose A0, the 11 points come from the other player? But there’s only one other player.

Let’s interpret carefully.

The wording: "they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players"

So: **If you choose A0, you gain +11 points**, and this money is **taken from the other player(s)**.

So it’s a **transferral**: If you play A0, you get +11, the other player loses 11.

Similarly, if the other player plays A0, they get +11, and you lose 11.

This is **per player, per action chosen**, so if both play A0, both get +11 from the other? That would be impossible — both gain 11? That would violate conservation.

Wait — likely **it's a net transfer**.

Let me re-read:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So: **For each player choosing A0, they receive 11 points**, and the source is the other player(s).

But if **both** choose A0, then each receives 11 points, and these must be drawn from the other — but that would require both gaining 11 and losing 11 → contradiction.

Unless “drawn equally from the other players” means that **the 11 points are deducted from the other player(s) as a whole**, and distributed to the A0 player.

But if both choose A0, then each gets 11, so the total payout is 22 points, but only one other player → can’t lose 22 from one player.

This suggests a **coherent interpretation** must be: Only **one** player receives the 11 points — or the payment is conditional on being the only one playing A0?

No — the contract applies regardless.

Alternatively: **The 11 points are paid by the other player to the A0 player** (not drawn from multiple players), and if both play A0, both receive 11 from the other.

But then:
- P1 plays A0 → gets +11 from P2
- P2 plays A0 → gets +11 from P1
→ so both gain 11, and both lose 11 → net zero?

Wait, no: the total points in the system would change.

But in game theory with transfers, we allow such mechanisms.

Let’s suppose:
- The **11 bonus** is paid **by each other player** **to each player who chooses A0**?

No — that would be unstable.

Best interpretation: **When a player chooses A0, they receive a +11 bonus, and the other player loses 11.**

So it’s a **one-way transfer**:
- If you play A0 and the other plays A1: you get +11, they lose 11.
- If you play A0 and the other plays A0: you get +11, they get −11.

But hang on: if both play A0:
- You get +11 (from contract)
- The other player gets −11 (from contract)
- Similarly, the other player gets +11 (from contract), you get −11 → so you lose 11 from contract, but gain +11 → net 0?

This is ambiguous.

But the contract says: "if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players"

"Drawn equally from the other players" suggests **the pool is taken from the other player(s)**.

So, suppose:
- The **additional 11 points for choosing A0** are paid **by the other player(s)**, so **each player who chooses A0 gets +11, paid by the other player(s)**.

But if **only one player chooses A0**, that player gets +11 from the other → other loses 11.

If **both players choose A0**, then:
- P1 gets +11 from P2
- P2 gets +11 from P1
→ so P1 gains 11, loses 11 → net 0
→ net: both get 0 from contract.

But that means the **net transfer is zero** when both choose A0.

So effectively:
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: you get +11, other gets −11
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A0: you get +11 −11 = 0 net
- Similarly, other player: same

So **the contract term only benefits you if you are the only one choosing A0**.

This seems to be the **only consistent interpretation**.

Alternatively, to avoid double-counting, maybe the contract is: When a player chooses A0, they receive 11, and the **other player loses 11** — this is a single transfer, not split.

But the phrase "drawn equally from the other players" suggests that if there are multiple other players, the cost is shared — but here only 2 players.

So likely: **If you play A0, you gain +11, and the other player loses 11**.

So:
- If only you play A0: you get +11, other loses 11
- If only other plays A0: you lose 11, other gets +11
- If both play A0: you get +11 (from contract) and lose 11 (to other), net 0 → same for both

So net effect: **A0 players get +11 only if the other player plays A1**.

Let’s formalize.

Let’s define the **total payoff after contract**.

Let’s suppose the contract is **active only if both sign**, and we are deciding whether to sign.

But we must **sign or not** — and it’s only active if all sign.

But since there are only two players, both must sign.

So we decide whether to sign.

Assume **if we sign**, the contract applies.

Then, the **final payoff** is:

Base payoff + contract bonus (if applicable)

Let’s define:

For each player:
- If they play A0, they get **+11**, but **the other player loses 11** (because "drawn equally from the other players" — and since only one other, they pay the full 11)

So the contract is **not a symmetric gain**, but a **transfer**: choosing A0 gives you +11, and the other player loses 11.

This is **identical in effect** to:
- If you play A0 → you gain +11, other loses 11
- If other plays A0 → they gain +11, you lose 11

This is **not additive**, because if both play A0:
- You get +11 (from your A0) but lose 11 (to other's A0) → net 0
- Same for other → net 0

So net contract effect:
- (A0, A0): both get 0 from contract
- (A0, A1): you get +11, other gets −11
- (A1, A0): you get −11, other gets +11
- (A1, A1): both get 0

So contract adds:
- +11 to A0 player, −11 to A1 player, when only one chooses A0
- 0 if both or neither choose A0

Now, we are **Player 2**, and we must decide whether to sign.

So let's compare:
- Your **expected payoff under contract** (if you sign) vs.
- Your **expected payoff without contract** (if you don't sign)

But — if you **don’t sign**, the contract is not active → no transfer.

If you **do sign**, contract is active only if the other player also signs — and since it’s approval voting, **it becomes active only if all sign**.

So your decision matters: if you don’t sign, contract is **not active**, regardless of what the other does.

If you sign, contract is **active only if the other signs**.

But the other player (P1) is rational and will also decide based on their own interest.

But we must assume they will act optimally.

So to decide, we need to analyze whether signing leads to higher expected payoff, **assuming both players will play optimally under the contract**, and only if both sign.

But we must assume that **if one player refuses to sign, the contract doesn’t apply**.

So our decision to sign affects whether the contract exists.

Now, here’s the key: **whether to sign**, we must predict what the game will look like **if we sign**, and whether it’s better than the base game.

Let’s consider two cases:

---

### **Case 1: Contract is active (both sign)**

Now, we need to find the Nash equilibrium in this **modified game**, with the contract.

Let’s define the **new payoff matrix** under contract.

Recall base payoffs:

|       | P1:A0 | P1:A1 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| P2:A0 | (10,10)| (2,6) |
| P2:A1 | (20,0) | (4,4) |

Now, add contract effects:

Let’s compute **final payoffs** when contract is active.

#### Outcome (A0, A0): both choose A0
- Base: (10,10)
- Contract: both get +11 and lose 11 → net 0
- Final: (10,10)

#### Outcome (A0, A1): P1:A0, P2:A1
- Base: (2,6)
- Contract:
  - P1 chose A0 → gets +11, P2 loses 11
  - P2 chose A1 → no gain/loss from contract
- So P1: 2 + 11 = 13
- P2: 6 − 11 = −5
- Final: (13, −5)

#### Outcome (A1, A0): P1:A1, P2:A0
- Base: (20,0)
- Contract:
  - P2 chose A0 → gets +11, P1 loses 11
  - P1 chose A1 → no gain/loss
- So P1: 20 − 11 = 9
- P2: 0 + 11 = 11
- Final: (9, 11)

#### Outcome (A1, A1): both choose A1
- Base: (4,4)
- Contract: no one gains/loses → (4,4)

So the **new payoff matrix** under contract:

|       | P1:A0 | P1:A1 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| P2:A0 | (10,10) | (20,0) |
| P2:A1 | (13,−5) | (4,4) |

Wait — no:

Wait: (A1, A0) is P1:A1, P2:A0 → so P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1 → that's **column A1**, **row A0**

So:

- (A0, A0): (10,10)
- (A0, A1): P1:A0, P2:A1 → (base: 2,6) → P1 gets +11 from contract → 2+11=13; P2 loses 11→6−11=−5 → (13, -5)
- (A1, A0): P1:A1, P2:A0 → base: (20,0) → P2 gets +11 → 0+11=11; P1 loses 11 → 20−11=9 → (9,11)
- (A1, A1): (4,4)

So corrected matrix:

|       | P1:A0 | P1:A1 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| P2:A

Your previous response was:
Let’s go through this step by step, carefully analyzing the game before and after the contract, and then decide whether to sign it.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

We are Player 2 (the other player is Player 1). The payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2) is:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0**    | (10,10)| (2,6)  |
| **P2: A1**    | (20,0) | (4,4)  |

So:
- If both choose A0 → (10,10)
- P2: A0, P1: A1 → (2,6)
- P2: A1, P1: A0 → (20,0)
- Both choose A1 → (4,4)

We are to choose a mixed strategy (probability distribution over A0 and A1) to maximize our expected payoff, assuming Player 1 is rational and will also choose optimally.

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the base game.

---

### **Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium (Base Game)**

Let:
- P1 choose A0 with probability p
- P2 choose A0 with probability q

Compute expected payoffs for each player.

#### **P2’s expected payoff:**

- If P2 chooses A0:  
  = p×10 + (1−p)×2 = 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2

- If P2 chooses A1:  
  = p×20 + (1−p)×4 = 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

P2 will be indifferent between A0 and A1 when:
8p + 2 = 16p + 4  
⇒ 8p = -2  
⇒ p = -0.25 → not possible (probability can’t be negative)

Since the coefficient of p is higher in A1 (16 > 8), for **any** p ≥ 0, A1 gives higher payoff.

But wait — that suggests P2 **always prefers A1**, regardless of p?

Wait — check again:  
If p = 0 (P1 always plays A1):  
- A0 gives 2  
- A1 gives 4 → better

If p = 1 (P1 always plays A0):  
- A0 gives 10  
- A1 gives 20 → still A1 better?

Wait — no: A1 gives 20 when P1 plays A0? Yes!

So when P1 plays A0, P2 gets 20 by playing A1? Yes, that’s right.

But if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 4 for A1, 2 for A0 → A1 is better.

So **regardless of P1’s strategy**, **A1 dominates A0 for Player 2**? Let’s verify.

Compare:
- A0 payoff: 8p + 2
- A1 payoff: 16p + 4

Difference (A1 − A0) = (16p + 4) − (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 > 0 for all p ≥ 0

So **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2**.

Therefore, **Player 2 will always play A1** in equilibrium.

Now consider Player 1.

#### **P1’s expected payoff**

- If P1 chooses A0:  
  = q×10 + (1−q)×20 = 10q + 20(1−q) = 10q + 20 − 20q = 20 − 10q

- If P1 chooses A1:  
  = q×6 + (1−q)×4 = 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

P1 is indifferent when:
20 − 10q = 2q + 4  
⇒ 20 − 4 = 12q  
⇒ 16 = 12q  
⇒ q = 16/12 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 → not possible

But again, let's see which is better:

If q = 1 (P2 always A0), P1 gets:
- A0: 10
- A1: 6 → so A0 better

If q = 0 (P2 always A1), P1 gets:
- A0: 20
- A1: 4 → A0 better

So A0 is always better than A1 for P1?

Wait: A0 gives 20 − 10q  
A1 gives 2q + 4

Difference (A0 − A1) = (20 − 10q) − (2q + 4) = 16 − 12q

This is positive when q < 16/12 ≈ 1.33 → which is always true.

So A0 strictly dominates A1 for P1.

Therefore, **P1 will always play A0**.

**So in the base game, the unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium is:**

- P1 plays A0
- P2 plays A1
- Payoff: (20, 0)

But wait: is this rational? P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0.

But can P1 ever do better?

If P1 plays A1, and P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4, which is worse than 20.

So yes, P1 has no incentive to deviate.

P2: if P2 plays A0 while P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10, which is worse than 20.

So P2 has no incentive to deviate.

**Thus, NE is: (A0, A1), payoff (20, 0)**

So **as Player 2, your expected payoff in the base game (with rational opponent) is 20 points**.

---

### **Step 3: Now consider the contract**

The contract:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other player(s)

Note: "drawn equally from the other players" → so if both players choose A0, the 11 points come from the other player? But there’s only one other player.

Let’s interpret carefully.

The wording: "they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players"

So: **If you choose A0, you gain +11 points**, and this money is **taken from the other player(s)**.

So it’s a **transferral**: If you play A0, you get +11, the other player loses 11.

Similarly, if the other player plays A0, they get +11, and you lose 11.

This is **per player, per action chosen**, so if both play A0, both get +11 from the other? That would be impossible — both gain 11? That would violate conservation.

Wait — likely **it's a net transfer**.

Let me re-read:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So: **For each player choosing A0, they receive 11 points**, and the source is the other player(s).

But if **both** choose A0, then each receives 11 points, and these must be drawn from the other — but that would require both gaining 11 and losing 11 → contradiction.

Unless “drawn equally from the other players” means that **the 11 points are deducted from the other player(s) as a whole**, and distributed to the A0 player.

But if both choose A0, then each gets 11, so the total payout is 22 points, but only one other player → can’t lose 22 from one player.

This suggests a **coherent interpretation** must be: Only **one** player receives the 11 points — or the payment is conditional on being the only one playing A0?

No — the contract applies regardless.

Alternatively: **The 11 points are paid by the other player to the A0 player** (not drawn from multiple players), and if both play A0, both receive 11 from the other.

But then:
- P1 plays A0 → gets +11 from P2
- P2 plays A0 → gets +11 from P1
→ so both gain 11, and both lose 11 → net zero?

Wait, no: the total points in the system would change.

But in game theory with transfers, we allow such mechanisms.

Let’s suppose:
- The **11 bonus** is paid **by each other player** **to each player who chooses A0**?

No — that would be unstable.

Best interpretation: **When a player chooses A0, they receive a +11 bonus, and the other player loses 11.**

So it’s a **one-way transfer**:
- If you play A0 and the other plays A1: you get +11, they lose 11.
- If you play A0 and the other plays A0: you get +11, they get −11.

But hang on: if both play A0:
- You get +11 (from contract)
- The other player gets −11 (from contract)
- Similarly, the other player gets +11 (from contract), you get −11 → so you lose 11 from contract, but gain +11 → net 0?

This is ambiguous.

But the contract says: "if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players"

"Drawn equally from the other players" suggests **the pool is taken from the other player(s)**.

So, suppose:
- The **additional 11 points for choosing A0** are paid **by the other player(s)**, so **each player who chooses A0 gets +11, paid by the other player(s)**.

But if **only one player chooses A0**, that player gets +11 from the other → other loses 11.

If **both players choose A0**, then:
- P1 gets +11 from P2
- P2 gets +11 from P1
→ so P1 gains 11, loses 11 → net 0
→ net: both get 0 from contract.

But that means the **net transfer is zero** when both choose A0.

So effectively:
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: you get +11, other gets −11
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A0: you get +11 −11 = 0 net
- Similarly, other player: same

So **the contract term only benefits you if you are the only one choosing A0**.

This seems to be the **only consistent interpretation**.

Alternatively, to avoid double-counting, maybe the contract is: When a player chooses A0, they receive 11, and the **other player loses 11** — this is a single transfer, not split.

But the phrase "drawn equally from the other players" suggests that if there are multiple other players, the cost is shared — but here only 2 players.

So likely: **If you play A0, you gain +11, and the other player loses 11**.

So:
- If only you play A0: you get +11, other loses 11
- If only other plays A0: you lose 11, other gets +11
- If both play A0: you get +11 (from contract) and lose 11 (to other), net 0 → same for both

So net effect: **A0 players get +11 only if the other player plays A1**.

Let’s formalize.

Let’s define the **total payoff after contract**.

Let’s suppose the contract is **active only if both sign**, and we are deciding whether to sign.

But we must **sign or not** — and it’s only active if all sign.

But since there are only two players, both must sign.

So we decide whether to sign.

Assume **if we sign**, the contract applies.

Then, the **final payoff** is:

Base payoff + contract bonus (if applicable)

Let’s define:

For each player:
- If they play A0, they get **+11**, but **the other player loses 11** (because "drawn equally from the other players" — and since only one other, they pay the full 11)

So the contract is **not a symmetric gain**, but a **transfer**: choosing A0 gives you +11, and the other player loses 11.

This is **identical in effect** to:
- If you play A0 → you gain +11, other loses 11
- If other plays A0 → they gain +11, you lose 11

This is **not additive**, because if both play A0:
- You get +11 (from your A0) but lose 11 (to other's A0) → net 0
- Same for other → net 0

So net contract effect:
- (A0, A0): both get 0 from contract
- (A0, A1): you get +11, other gets −11
- (A1, A0): you get −11, other gets +11
- (A1, A1): both get 0

So contract adds:
- +11 to A0 player, −11 to A1 player, when only one chooses A0
- 0 if both or neither choose A0

Now, we are **Player 2**, and we must decide whether to sign.

So let's compare:
- Your **expected payoff under contract** (if you sign) vs.
- Your **expected payoff without contract** (if you don't sign)

But — if you **don’t sign**, the contract is not active → no transfer.

If you **do sign**, contract is active only if the other player also signs — and since it’s approval voting, **it becomes active only if all sign**.

So your decision matters: if you don’t sign, contract is **not active**, regardless of what the other does.

If you sign, contract is **active only if the other signs**.

But the other player (P1) is rational and will also decide based on their own interest.

But we must assume they will act optimally.

So to decide, we need to analyze whether signing leads to higher expected payoff, **assuming both players will play optimally under the contract**, and only if both sign.

But we must assume that **if one player refuses to sign, the contract doesn’t apply**.

So our decision to sign affects whether the contract exists.

Now, here’s the key: **whether to sign**, we must predict what the game will look like **if we sign**, and whether it’s better than the base game.

Let’s consider two cases:

---

### **Case 1: Contract is active (both sign)**

Now, we need to find the Nash equilibrium in this **modified game**, with the contract.

Let’s define the **new payoff matrix** under contract.

Recall base payoffs:

|       | P1:A0 | P1:A1 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| P2:A0 | (10,10)| (2,6) |
| P2:A1 | (20,0) | (4,4) |

Now, add contract effects:

Let’s compute **final payoffs** when contract is active.

#### Outcome (A0, A0): both choose A0
- Base: (10,10)
- Contract: both get +11 and lose 11 → net 0
- Final: (10,10)

#### Outcome (A0, A1): P1:A0, P2:A1
- Base: (2,6)
- Contract:
  - P1 chose A0 → gets +11, P2 loses 11
  - P2 chose A1 → no gain/loss from contract
- So P1: 2 + 11 = 13
- P2: 6 − 11 = −5
- Final: (13, −5)

#### Outcome (A1, A0): P1:A1, P2:A0
- Base: (20,0)
- Contract:
  - P2 chose A0 → gets +11, P1 loses 11
  - P1 chose A1 → no gain/loss
- So P1: 20 − 11 = 9
- P2: 0 + 11 = 11
- Final: (9, 11)

#### Outcome (A1, A1): both choose A1
- Base: (4,4)
- Contract: no one gains/loses → (4,4)

So the **new payoff matrix** under contract:

|       | P1:A0 | P1:A1 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| P2:A0 | (10,10) | (20,0) |
| P2:A1 | (13,−5) | (4,4) |

Wait — no:

Wait: (A1, A0) is P1:A1, P2:A0 → so P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1 → that's **column A1**, **row A0**

So:

- (A0, A0): (10,10)
- (A0, A1): P1:A0, P2:A1 → (base: 2,6) → P1 gets +11 from contract → 2+11=13; P2 loses 11→6−11=−5 → (13, -5)
- (A1, A0): P1:A1, P2:A0 → base: (20,0) → P2 gets +11 → 0+11=11; P1 loses 11 → 20−11=9 → (9,11)
- (A1, A1): (4,4)

So corrected matrix:

|       | P1:A0 | P1:A1 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| P2:A

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in the response 'Let’s go through this step by step, carefully analyzing the game before and after the contract, and then decide whether to sign it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**\n\nWe are Player 2 (the other player is Player 1). The payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2) is:\n\n|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| **P2: A0**    | (10,10)| (2,6)  |\n| **P2: A1**    | (20,0) | (4,4)  |\n\nSo:\n- If both choose A0 → (10,10)\n- P2: A0, P1: A1 → (2,6)\n- P2: A1, P1: A0 → (20,0)\n- Both choose A1 → (4,4)\n\nWe are to choose a mixed strategy (probability distribution over A0 and A1) to maximize our expected payoff, assuming Player 1 is rational and will also choose optimally.\n\nLet’s find the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the base game.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Find the Nash Equilibrium (Base Game)**\n\nLet:\n- P1 choose A0 with probability p\n- P2 choose A0 with probability q\n\nCompute expected payoffs for each player.\n\n#### **P2’s expected payoff:**\n\n- If P2 chooses A0:  \n  = p×10 + (1−p)×2 = 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2\n\n- If P2 chooses A1:  \n  = p×20 + (1−p)×4 = 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4\n\nP2 will be indifferent between A0 and A1 when:\n8p + 2 = 16p + 4  \n⇒ 8p = -2  \n⇒ p = -0.25 → not possible (probability can’t be negative)\n\nSince the coefficient of p is higher in A1 (16 > 8), for **any** p ≥ 0, A1 gives higher payoff.\n\nBut wait — that suggests P2 **always prefers A1**, regardless of p?\n\nWait — check again:  \nIf p = 0 (P1 always plays A1):  \n- A0 gives 2  \n- A1 gives 4 → better\n\nIf p = 1 (P1 always plays A0):  \n- A0 gives 10  \n- A1 gives 20 → still A1 better?\n\nWait — no: A1 gives 20 when P1 plays A0? Yes!\n\nSo when P1 plays A0, P2 gets 20 by playing A1? Yes, that’s right.\n\nBut if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 4 for A1, 2 for A0 → A1 is better.\n\nSo **regardless of P1’s strategy**, **A1 dominates A0 for Player 2**? Let’s verify.\n\nCompare:\n- A0 payoff: 8p + 2\n- A1 payoff: 16p + 4\n\nDifference (A1 − A0) = (16p + 4) − (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 > 0 for all p ≥ 0\n\nSo **A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2**.\n\nTherefore, **Player 2 will always play A1** in equilibrium.\n\nNow consider Player 1.\n\n#### **P1’s expected payoff**\n\n- If P1 chooses A0:  \n  = q×10 + (1−q)×20 = 10q + 20(1−q) = 10q + 20 − 20q = 20 − 10q\n\n- If P1 chooses A1:  \n  = q×6 + (1−q)×4 = 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4\n\nP1 is indifferent when:\n20 − 10q = 2q + 4  \n⇒ 20 − 4 = 12q  \n⇒ 16 = 12q  \n⇒ q = 16/12 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 → not possible\n\nBut again, let\'s see which is better:\n\nIf q = 1 (P2 always A0), P1 gets:\n- A0: 10\n- A1: 6 → so A0 better\n\nIf q = 0 (P2 always A1), P1 gets:\n- A0: 20\n- A1: 4 → A0 better\n\nSo A0 is always better than A1 for P1?\n\nWait: A0 gives 20 − 10q  \nA1 gives 2q + 4\n\nDifference (A0 − A1) = (20 − 10q) − (2q + 4) = 16 − 12q\n\nThis is positive when q < 16/12 ≈ 1.33 → which is always true.\n\nSo A0 strictly dominates A1 for P1.\n\nTherefore, **P1 will always play A0**.\n\n**So in the base game, the unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium is:**\n\n- P1 plays A0\n- P2 plays A1\n- Payoff: (20, 0)\n\nBut wait: is this rational? P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0.\n\nBut can P1 ever do better?\n\nIf P1 plays A1, and P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4, which is worse than 20.\n\nSo yes, P1 has no incentive to deviate.\n\nP2: if P2 plays A0 while P1 plays A0, P2 gets 10, which is worse than 20.\n\nSo P2 has no incentive to deviate.\n\n**Thus, NE is: (A0, A1), payoff (20, 0)**\n\nSo **as Player 2, your expected payoff in the base game (with rational opponent) is 20 points**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Now consider the contract**\n\nThe contract:\n> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other player(s)\n\nNote: "drawn equally from the other players" → so if both players choose A0, the 11 points come from the other player? But there’s only one other player.\n\nLet’s interpret carefully.\n\nThe wording: "they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players"\n\nSo: **If you choose A0, you gain +11 points**, and this money is **taken from the other player(s)**.\n\nSo it’s a **transferral**: If you play A0, you get +11, the other player loses 11.\n\nSimilarly, if the other player plays A0, they get +11, and you lose 11.\n\nThis is **per player, per action chosen**, so if both play A0, both get +11 from the other? That would be impossible — both gain 11? That would violate conservation.\n\nWait — likely **it\'s a net transfer**.\n\nLet me re-read:\n> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."\n\nSo: **For each player choosing A0, they receive 11 points**, and the source is the other player(s).\n\nBut if **both** choose A0, then each receives 11 points, and these must be drawn from the other — but that would require both gaining 11 and losing 11 → contradiction.\n\nUnless “drawn equally from the other players” means that **the 11 points are deducted from the other player(s) as a whole**, and distributed to the A0 player.\n\nBut if both choose A0, then each gets 11, so the total payout is 22 points, but only one other player → can’t lose 22 from one player.\n\nThis suggests a **coherent interpretation** must be: Only **one** player receives the 11 points — or the payment is conditional on being the only one playing A0?\n\nNo — the contract applies regardless.\n\nAlternatively: **The 11 points are paid by the other player to the A0 player** (not drawn from multiple players), and if both play A0, both receive 11 from the other.\n\nBut then:\n- P1 plays A0 → gets +11 from P2\n- P2 plays A0 → gets +11 from P1\n→ so both gain 11, and both lose 11 → net zero?\n\nWait, no: the total points in the system would change.\n\nBut in game theory with transfers, we allow such mechanisms.\n\nLet’s suppose:\n- The **11 bonus** is paid **by each other player** **to each player who chooses A0**?\n\nNo — that would be unstable.\n\nBest interpretation: **When a player chooses A0, they receive a +11 bonus, and the other player loses 11.**\n\nSo it’s a **one-way transfer**:\n- If you play A0 and the other plays A1: you get +11, they lose 11.\n- If you play A0 and the other plays A0: you get +11, they get −11.\n\nBut hang on: if both play A0:\n- You get +11 (from contract)\n- The other player gets −11 (from contract)\n- Similarly, the other player gets +11 (from contract), you get −11 → so you lose 11 from contract, but gain +11 → net 0?\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nBut the contract says: "if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players"\n\n"Drawn equally from the other players" suggests **the pool is taken from the other player(s)**.\n\nSo, suppose:\n- The **additional 11 points for choosing A0** are paid **by the other player(s)**, so **each player who chooses A0 gets +11, paid by the other player(s)**.\n\nBut if **only one player chooses A0**, that player gets +11 from the other → other loses 11.\n\nIf **both players choose A0**, then:\n- P1 gets +11 from P2\n- P2 gets +11 from P1\n→ so P1 gains 11, loses 11 → net 0\n→ net: both get 0 from contract.\n\nBut that means the **net transfer is zero** when both choose A0.\n\nSo effectively:\n- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: you get +11, other gets −11\n- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A0: you get +11 −11 = 0 net\n- Similarly, other player: same\n\nSo **the contract term only benefits you if you are the only one choosing A0**.\n\nThis seems to be the **only consistent interpretation**.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid double-counting, maybe the contract is: When a player chooses A0, they receive 11, and the **other player loses 11** — this is a single transfer, not split.\n\nBut the phrase "drawn equally from the other players" suggests that if there are multiple other players, the cost is shared — but here only 2 players.\n\nSo likely: **If you play A0, you gain +11, and the other player loses 11**.\n\nSo:\n- If only you play A0: you get +11, other loses 11\n- If only other plays A0: you lose 11, other gets +11\n- If both play A0: you get +11 (from contract) and lose 11 (to other), net 0 → same for both\n\nSo net effect: **A0 players get +11 only if the other player plays A1**.\n\nLet’s formalize.\n\nLet’s define the **total payoff after contract**.\n\nLet’s suppose the contract is **active only if both sign**, and we are deciding whether to sign.\n\nBut we must **sign or not** — and it’s only active if all sign.\n\nBut since there are only two players, both must sign.\n\nSo we decide whether to sign.\n\nAssume **if we sign**, the contract applies.\n\nThen, the **final payoff** is:\n\nBase payoff + contract bonus (if applicable)\n\nLet’s define:\n\nFor each player:\n- If they play A0, they get **+11**, but **the other player loses 11** (because "drawn equally from the other players" — and since only one other, they pay the full 11)\n\nSo the contract is **not a symmetric gain**, but a **transfer**: choosing A0 gives you +11, and the other player loses 11.\n\nThis is **identical in effect** to:\n- If you play A0 → you gain +11, other loses 11\n- If other plays A0 → they gain +11, you lose 11\n\nThis is **not additive**, because if both play A0:\n- You get +11 (from your A0) but lose 11 (to other\'s A0) → net 0\n- Same for other → net 0\n\nSo net contract effect:\n- (A0, A0): both get 0 from contract\n- (A0, A1): you get +11, other gets −11\n- (A1, A0): you get −11, other gets +11\n- (A1, A1): both get 0\n\nSo contract adds:\n- +11 to A0 player, −11 to A1 player, when only one chooses A0\n- 0 if both or neither choose A0\n\nNow, we are **Player 2**, and we must decide whether to sign.\n\nSo let\'s compare:\n- Your **expected payoff under contract** (if you sign) vs.\n- Your **expected payoff without contract** (if you don\'t sign)\n\nBut — if you **don’t sign**, the contract is not active → no transfer.\n\nIf you **do sign**, contract is active only if the other player also signs — and since it’s approval voting, **it becomes active only if all sign**.\n\nSo your decision matters: if you don’t sign, contract is **not active**, regardless of what the other does.\n\nIf you sign, contract is **active only if the other signs**.\n\nBut the other player (P1) is rational and will also decide based on their own interest.\n\nBut we must assume they will act optimally.\n\nSo to decide, we need to analyze whether signing leads to higher expected payoff, **assuming both players will play optimally under the contract**, and only if both sign.\n\nBut we must assume that **if one player refuses to sign, the contract doesn’t apply**.\n\nSo our decision to sign affects whether the contract exists.\n\nNow, here’s the key: **whether to sign**, we must predict what the game will look like **if we sign**, and whether it’s better than the base game.\n\nLet’s consider two cases:\n\n---\n\n### **Case 1: Contract is active (both sign)**\n\nNow, we need to find the Nash equilibrium in this **modified game**, with the contract.\n\nLet’s define the **new payoff matrix** under contract.\n\nRecall base payoffs:\n\n|       | P1:A0 | P1:A1 |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| P2:A0 | (10,10)| (2,6) |\n| P2:A1 | (20,0) | (4,4) |\n\nNow, add contract effects:\n\nLet’s compute **final payoffs** when contract is active.\n\n#### Outcome (A0, A0): both choose A0\n- Base: (10,10)\n- Contract: both get +11 and lose 11 → net 0\n- Final: (10,10)\n\n#### Outcome (A0, A1): P1:A0, P2:A1\n- Base: (2,6)\n- Contract:\n  - P1 chose A0 → gets +11, P2 loses 11\n  - P2 chose A1 → no gain/loss from contract\n- So P1: 2 + 11 = 13\n- P2: 6 − 11 = −5\n- Final: (13, −5)\n\n#### Outcome (A1, A0): P1:A1, P2:A0\n- Base: (20,0)\n- Contract:\n  - P2 chose A0 → gets +11, P1 loses 11\n  - P1 chose A1 → no gain/loss\n- So P1: 20 − 11 = 9\n- P2: 0 + 11 = 11\n- Final: (9, 11)\n\n#### Outcome (A1, A1): both choose A1\n- Base: (4,4)\n- Contract: no one gains/loses → (4,4)\n\nSo the **new payoff matrix** under contract:\n\n|       | P1:A0 | P1:A1 |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| P2:A0 | (10,10) | (20,0) |\n| P2:A1 | (13,−5) | (4,4) |\n\nWait — no:\n\nWait: (A1, A0) is P1:A1, P2:A0 → so P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1 → that\'s **column A1**, **row A0**\n\nSo:\n\n- (A0, A0): (10,10)\n- (A0,

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game Structure

This is a simultaneous-move two-player game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 is row player, Player 2 is column player):

|             | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (10, 10)     | (20, 0)      |
| **Player 2: A1** | (2, 6)       | (4, 4)       |

Note: In this setup, **you are Player 2**, so you choose the row, and Player 1 chooses the column.

Our goal is to **maximize your (Player 2's) expected payoff**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Payoff Structure

We now analyze your expected payoff depending on your strategy and Player 1’s strategy.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that **Player 1** chooses A0 (we don't control this).
- $ q $ = probability that **you (Player 2)** choose A0. Then $ 1 - q $ = probability you choose A1.

Your expected payoff is:

$$
E[\text{Payoff}] = q \cdot [p \cdot 10 + (1 - p) \cdot 2] + (1 - q) \cdot [p \cdot 4 + (1 - p) \cdot 4]
$$

Simplify:

First term (you play A0):
- If Player 1 plays A0 (prob p): you get 10
- If Player 1 plays A1 (prob 1−p): you get 2
→ Total: $ p \cdot 10 + (1 - p) \cdot 2 = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $

Second term (you play A1):
- If Player 1 plays A0: you get 4
- If Player 1 plays A1: you get 4
→ Total: $ p \cdot 4 + (1 - p) \cdot 4 = 4 $

So overall expected payoff:

$$
E = q(8p + 2) + (1 - q)(4) = q(8p + 2) + 4 - 4q = q(8p + 2 - 4) + 4 = q(8p - 2) + 4
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine Optimal Strategy Based on Player 1’s Beliefs

We don't know what **Player 1** will do. But in a game-theoretic setting, we assume both players are rational. Let’s look for a **Nash Equilibrium (NE)**.

We want to find a mixed strategy for you (Player 2) such that **Player 1 is indifferent** between A0 and A1 (or vice versa), and you are choosing optimally.

But since you’re choosing first (or simultaneously), we need to find the **best response** to Player 1's mixed strategy.

But since both choose simultaneously, we look for **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ p $
- You (Player 2) play A0 with probability $ q $

We want to find $ q $ such that you are optimizing against Player 1’s choice, and vice versa.

Let’s compute the **best response functions**.

---

### Step 4: Best Response for You (Player 2)

Your expected payoff is:

$$
E(q) = q(8p - 2) + 4
$$

So, the sign of $ (8p - 2) $ determines your best choice:

- If $ 8p - 2 > 0 $ → $ p > 0.25 $: then increase $ q $ → best response is $ q = 1 $ (play A0 always)
- If $ 8p - 2 < 0 $ → $ p < 0.25 $: then decrease $ q $ → best response is $ q = 0 $ (play A1 always)
- If $ p = 0.25 $: you are indifferent; any $ q $ is ok

So your best response is:
$$
q^* = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } p > 0.25 \\
0 & \text{if } p < 0.25 \\
\text{any } q \in [0,1] & \text{if } p = 0.25
\end{cases}
$$

---

### Step 5: Best Response for Player 1 (Against Your Strategy)

Now, let’s find Player 1’s best response.

Let $ q $ = your probability of playing A0.

Player 1’s expected payoff:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You play A0 (prob q): payoff = 10
  - You play A1 (prob 1−q): payoff = 0
  → Expected: $ q \cdot 10 + (1 - q) \cdot 0 = 10q $
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You play A0: payoff = 6
  - You play A1: payoff = 4
  → Expected: $ q \cdot 6 + (1 - q) \cdot 4 = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

So Player 1 is indifferent when:
$$
10q = 2q + 4 \Rightarrow 8q = 4 \Rightarrow q = 0.5
$$

So:
- If $ q > 0.5 $: Player 1 prefers A0 (because 10q > 2q+4)
- If $ q < 0.5 $: Player 1 prefers A1
- If $ q = 0.5 $: Player 1 is indifferent

---

### Step 6: Find Nash Equilibrium

We look for $ p $ and $ q $ such that:
- You (Player 2) are playing best response to $ p $
- Player 1 is playing best response to $ q $

Let’s try $ q = 0.5 $. Then Player 1 is indifferent → any $ p $ is best response? No: best response is to play A0 if $ 10q > 2q + 4 $, which is true when $ q > 0.5 $, but at $ q = 0.5 $, they are indifferent → so **any** $ p $ is best response.

Now, check if $ q = 0.5 $ is a best response to Player 1’s strategy.

From earlier: you are best response to $ p $ as:
- $ q = 1 $ if $ p > 0.25 $
- $ q = 0 $ if $ p < 0.25 $
- any $ q $ if $ p = 0.25 $

So for you to play $ q = 0.5 $, we need $ p = 0.25 $

Now, does $ p = 0.25 $ make Player 1 indifferent?

Player 1’s payoff from A0: $ 10q = 10 \cdot 0.5 = 5 $

Player 1’s payoff from A1: $ 2q + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 $

Yes! They are indifferent.

Therefore, when $ p = 0.25 $, Player 1 is indifferent → so playing $ p = 0.25 $ is a best response.

And when $ q = 0.5 $, you are indifferent *only if* $ p = 0.25 $ → so you can play $ q = 0.5 $

This gives a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**:
- Player 1: A0 with probability 0.25, A1 with probability 0.75
- Player 2: A0 with probability 0.5, A1 with probability 0.5

Now, is this the *only* Nash equilibrium?

Are there pure strategy equilibria?

Check pure strategies:

1. (A0, A0): Both play A0 → (10,10)
   - Player 2: if deviates to A1, gets 2 < 10 → no incentive
   - Player 1: if deviates to A1, gets 0 < 10 → no incentive
   → So (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

2. (A1, A1): (4,4)
   - Player 2: deviate to A0 → get 2 < 4 → no
   - Player 1: deviate to A0 → get 6 > 4 → yes, profitable
   → Not Nash

3. (A1, A0): Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 plays A0 → (2,6)
   - Player 2: deviate to A0 → gets 10 > 2 → yes → not Nash

4. (A0, A1): Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 plays A1 → (20,0)
   - Player 2: gets 2, deviating to A1 gives 4 > 2 → yes, profit → not Nash

So **only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**

But we also have a mixed strategy equilibrium: Player 1 plays A0 with 0.25, you play A0 with 0.5.

---

### Step 7: Which Equilibrium to Play?

Now, the challenge is: **What strategy should YOU choose?**

You are a rational player trying to maximize your expected payoff, **assuming the other player is also rational**.

But there are **two equilibria**:
1. (A0,A0) – pure, both get 10
2. Mixed: Player 1 plays A0 with 0.25, you play A0 with 0.5

But in the mixed equilibrium:
- Your expected payoff is:
  - $ E = q(8p - 2) + 4 $, with $ q = 0.5 $, $ p = 0.25 $
  → $ E = 0.5(8*0.25 - 2) + 4 = 0.5(2 - 2) + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4 $

Wait, that can't be right — let's recompute.

Wait: this can't be — in the mixed equilibrium, we know each player must get the same expected payoff as their **minimax** or **indifference** value.

Let’s compute **your expected payoff in the mixed strategy NE**.

In the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:
- Player 1: plays A0 with 0.25, A1 with 0.75
- You: play A0 with 0.5, A1 with 0.5

Now compute your expected payoff:

There are 4 outcomes:
1. (A0, A0): prob = 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 → you get 10
2. (A0, A1): prob = 0.5 * 0.75 = 0.375 → you get 2
3. (A1, A0): prob = 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 → you get 20
4. (A1, A1): prob = 0.5 * 0.75 = 0.375 → you get 4

So your expected payoff:
$$
E = 0.125 \cdot 10 + 0.375 \cdot 2 + 0.125 \cdot 20 + 0.375 \cdot 4
$$
$$
= 1.25 + 0.75 + 2.5 + 1.5 = 6.0
$$

So in mixed NE, you get **6 points**.

In pure NE (A0,A0), you get **10 points**, **if** Player 1 commits to A0.

But is (A0,A0) the only outcome you can rely on?

Here's the key: **You must choose a strategy before seeing Player 1’s choice.**

If you play A0 (with certainty), and Player 1 also plays A0, you get 10.

But if Player 1 plays A1, you only get 2.

So if you play A0 always, your expected payoff depends on Player 1’s choice.

But Player 1 is also rational.

In the pure strategy equilibrium (A0,A0), both are playing A0 and no one benefits from deviating.

So **(A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium** — and **you can expect this to happen if both players are playing NE**.

But is it the **only** equilibrium we should consider?

Wait — in the mixed NE, you get only 6, but in pure NE, you get 10.

So why would a rational player play mixed when pure is available?

But the problem is: **you don't know if Player 1 will play A0 or not**.

But if you believe that Player 1 is rational and will play equilibrium strategies, then there are **two** possible equilibria:
- One is (A0,A0): payoff to you = 10
- One is mixed: payoff = 6

But in game theory, when multiple equilibria exist, we might use **focal points** or **risk-dominance**.

Let’s compare them.

In (A0,A0): you get 10, Player 1 gets 10

Is this risk-dominant?

Alternatively, think: if you play A0, what do you expect?

But here’s the twist: **Player 2 rejected the payment contract**, but we are told that the **contract is not active**.

So we ignore that.

Now, go back: Player 1 proposed a contract that would give +11 to any player who plays A0, paid from the other.

But **Player 2 rejected it** → so it does not apply.

So you don't get any extra 11.

But the contract was only **for A0 players** — and you rejected it → so you are not subject to it.

So we go back to original payoffs.

Now, the key question: **what should YOU do?**

You want to maximize expected payoff.

But you don't know what Player 1 will do.

But assuming **both players are rational and will play Nash equilibria**, we must consider which equilibria are plausible.

Now, note: in the **mixed strategy equilibrium**, both are playing mixed strategies.

But in **pure strategy (A0,A0)**, both get high payoff and neither has incentive to deviate.

So (A0,A0) is a **Pareto superior** equilibrium.

But is it **safe**?

Suppose you play A0, and believe Player 1 will play A0 → you get 10.

But if Player 1 plays A1 → you get only 2.

So playing A0 is risky if you're unsure.

But suppose you play A1 → then:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20 (very good!)
- If Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4

So if you play A1, you are exposed to 20 (if Player 1 plays A0) or only 4 (if A1).

So it's also risky.

But now let’s compare expected payoffs.

Wait — but in the equilibrium, Player 1’s best response to you playing A0 is to play A0 (since 10 > 0), so (A0,A0) is stable.

So if you play A0, Player 1 will also play A0 (if rational), so you get 10.

Similarly, if you play A1, Player 1 would play A0 (since 6 > 4), so you get 2.

So if you play A1, Player 1 plays A0 → you get 2.

Similarly, if you play A0, Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10.

So best is to play A0.

Thus: **playing A0 is best if Player 1 plays best response**.

And in equilibrium, they do.

In fact, the strategy **"play A0"** is a **dominant strategy for Player 2?**

Let’s check:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You playing A0 → 10
  - You playing A1 → 2 → so A0 better
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You playing A0 → 2
  - You playing A1 → 4 → so A1 better

So **no**, A0 is not dominant.

Player 2 has **no dominant strategy**.

But the **only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (A0,A0)**, where you get 10.

The mixed equilibrium gives you only 6.

So if you believe that Player 1 will play A0, then A0 is best.

But what if you are uncertain?

Wait — in the **mixed strategy equilibrium**, Player 1 plays A0 with p = 0.25.

But is this really plausible?

Because if you play A0, then Player 1 will also play A0 — because it gives them 10, instead of 0 (if you play A1).

But in the mixed strategy equilibrium, Player 1 is mixing only because you are mixing.

But if you play A0, Player 1 has **no incentive** to play A1.

So the **mixed strategy equilibrium** relies on Player 1 being willing to play A1 with 0.75 probability — but why would they?

Because if you are playing A0 with probability 0.5, then:

- Player 1’s expected payoff from A0: 10 * 0.5 = 5
- From A1: 6 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5 = 3 + 2 = 5 → indifferent

So yes, they are indifferent → so mixing is allowed.

But in that case, you get only 6.

But if **you** choose to play A0 with certainty, then Player 1 gets 10 from A0 vs 0 from A1 → so they will play A0 → you get 10.

So your payoff increases to 10.

Similarly, if you play A0 with probability 1, you get 10.

If you play A0 with probability 0, you get 2 (if Player 1 plays A0) — but Player 1 might play A1 then?

No — if you play A1 for sure, Player 1 gets 6 from A0, 4 from A1 → so they will play A0 → you get 2.

So no better choice.

Now, suppose you mix.

Can you get more than 10?

No, because max from any strategy is 20 but only if Player 1 plays A0 and you play A1.

But if you play A1, Player 1 will **not** play A0 → because they prefer A0 only if you play A0.

Wait: if you play A1 (certainly), then:
- Player 1: A0 → gets 0; A1 → gets 4 → so they will play A1 → you get 4.

So you get 4.

So maximum you can get is **10**, if you play A0 and Player 1 plays A0.

You get **20** only if:
- You play A1
- Player 1 plays A0

But if you play A1, Player 1 will not play A0 — because it would give them 0, while playing A1 gives them 4.

So **(A1, A0)** is not an equilibrium.

So **you can never achieve 20**, because if you play A1, Player 1 will play A1 → you get 4.

So the only way to get 20 is if both play A1? No — if you play A1 and Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20, but Player 1 gets 0.

But Player 1 would **not** do that.

So this outcome is unstable.

Therefore, in **rational play**, you will not see A1 from you and A0 from Player 1.

Similarly, (A0, A1) — you get 2, Player 1 gets 6 — but if Player 1 plays A1, they get 6; if they play A0, they get 10? No, 10 is when you play A0.

If you play A0 and Player 1 plays A1, then Player 1 gets 6.

But if they play A0, they get 10.

So they would prefer A0.

So (A0, A1) is not stable.

So the only stable outcome is (A0, A0).

Therefore, **a rational Player 2 should play A0**, because it leads to (A0,A0), which is the only stable equilibrium, and you get 10.

Any deviation leads to worse or unstable outcomes.

Even in the mixed equilibrium, you only get 6 — worse than 10.

Therefore, **your best strategy is to play A0 with probability 100%**.

You don’t need to randomize.

So why would you mix?

Only if you are unsure, but since both are rational, and (A0,A0) is a mutual best response, you should go for it.

Even in iterated reasoning: you play A0 → Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10 → both happy.

So **play A0 with probability 100%**.

response:
To decide which contracts to approve, we need to evaluate the impact each contract will have on the payoffs in the game and whether they help maximize our total points.

### Initial Payoff Matrix (without contracts):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

### Evaluating Contracts:
#### Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

This contract alters the payoffs as follows:
- (A0, A0): (10+2-2, 10+2-2) = (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0+2-1, 20-2+1) = (1, 19)
- (A1, A0): (6-2+1, 2+2-1) = (5, 3)
- (A1, A1): (4-2+2, 4-2+2) = (4, 4)

New Payoff Matrix:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (1, 19)
- (A1, A0): (5, 3)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

#### Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payment in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.

This contract alters the payoffs as follows:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20-5+2.5) = (0, 17.5)
- (A1, A0): (6-5+2.5, 2) = (3.5, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4-5+2.5, 4-5+2.5) = (1.5, 1.5)

New Payoff Matrix:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 17.5)
- (A1, A0): (3.5, 2)
- (A1, A1): (1.5, 1.5)

### Analysis:
- **Player 1's Contract:** Results in more balanced payoffs and preserves relatively high points for cooperating on A0 and not severe penalties for choosing A1.
- **Player 2's Contract:** Severely penalizes choosing A1, reducing the payoffs significantly in scenarios involving A1.

Based on the objective of maximizing our total points, Player 1's contract seems more favorable as it maintains a higher average payoff and doesn't heavily penalize actions that could still be strategically valuable.

### Final Decision:
```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": false
}
```
Player 1's contract should be approved, and Player 2's should be rejected.

response:
To determine which contracts to approve, we need to analyze the impact on your (Player 1) total points for each possible outcome:

First, let's understand the game without any contracts:

| Your Choice | Player 2 Choice | Your Points | Player 2 Points |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| A0          | A0              | 10          | 10               |

| A1          | A1              | 4           | 4                |

Now, let's evaluate the contracts:

### Contract proposed by Player 1:

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other player.

| Your Choice | Player 2 Choice | Your Points | Additional Points | Net Points |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| A0          | A0              | 10          | +2                | 12         |
| A0          | A1              | 0           | +2                | 2          |
| A1          | A0              | 6           | -2                | 4          |
| A1          | A1              | 4           | -2                | 2          |

### Contract proposed by Player 2:

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

| Your Choice | Player 2 Choice | Your Points | Additional Points | Net Points |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| A0          | A0              | 10          | +11               | 21         |
| A0          | A1              | 0           | +11               | 11         |
| A1          | A0              | 6           | -11               |            -5 |
| A1          | A1              | 4           | 0                 | 4          |

#### Analysis:

- Contract proposed by Player 1: This incentivizes cooperation (both playing A0) as it gives an additional 2 points to the A0 choice.
- Contract proposed by Player 2: This heavily incentivizes choosing A0 by giving a substantial point bonus (+11), which can drastically increase your total points unless both choose A1.

### Strategic Decision:

You should aim to maximize your outcome while considering how likely Player 2 is to play the actions based on the contract. The key is to figure out which contract mutually provides better incentives and alignment for cooperation or higher points.

Given the strong incentivization bias in Player 2's contract towards A0:
- This scenario can drastically maximize points.
- However, Player 1's contract seems more balanced and promotes mutual cooperation.

Thus:
- Player 1's contract is expected to balance fairness.
- Player 2's contract giving heavy bias towards A0 inflates points without fair risk distribution.

**Final Decision:**

I will approve both contracts given the potential high points from Player 2's proposal.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

To decide whether to approve the proposed contracts, we need to analyze the impact of each contract on the payoffs and our total points in the game. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis

**Base Payoff Analysis (Without Contracts):**

| Player 1's Action | Player 2's Action | Player 1's Points | Player 2's Points |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| A0               | A0               | 10               | 10               |
| A0               | A1               | 0                | 20               |
| A1               | A0               | 6                | 2                |
| A1               | A1               | 4                | 4                |

### Contract 1:

**Contract proposed by Player 1:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Let's update the payoff table with Contract 1:

| Player 1's Action | Player 2's Action | Player 1's Points | Player 2's Points |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| A0               | A0               | 12               | 8                |
| A0               | A1               | 2                | 18               |
| A1               | A0               | 4                | 4                |
| A1               | A1               | 2                | 2                |

**Analysis for Contract 1:**
- If both choose A0, we get more points than usual: our points increase from 10 to 12.
- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1, we get 2 points instead of 0, which is slightly better for us.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0, our points drop from 6 to 4, which is worse for us.
- If both choose A1, our points drop from 4 to 2, which is worse for us.

### Contract 2:

**Contract proposed by Player 2:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Let's update the payoff table with Contract 2:

| Player 1's Action | Player 2's Action | Player 1's Points | Player 2's Points |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| A0               | A0               | 20               | 0                |
| A0               | A1               | 10               | 10               |
| A1               | A0               | -4               | 14               |
| A1               | A1               | -6               | -6               |

**Analysis for Contract 2:**
- If both choose A0, we significantly benefit: we get 20 points, but Player 2 loses more.
- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1, we get 10 points, which is better for us.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0, we lose a substantial amount of points, which is very bad for us.
- If both choose A1, both incur significant losses, which is also very bad for both players.

### Conclusion:

- Contract 1 has a mixed impact but generally seems better for us than not having any contract. 
- Contract 2 could lead to very high points for us if we choose A0, but it introduces significant risks if we (or the other player) choose A1.

Given the analysis, we make our decisions based on risk and reward balance. Therefore, approving Contract 1 seems reasonable as it reduces our risks, while Contract 2 introduces significant risks despite some potential high rewards.

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": false
}
```

This decision aims to balance our points while mitigating risk.

To make a well-informed decision, let's first analyze the impact of each proposed contract on the payout matrix and on my potential points.

### Current Payoff Matrix without Contract:
```
                 | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1
------------------------------------------
Player 1 A0      | (10, 10)    | (0, 20)
Player 1 A1      | (6, 2)      | (4,  4)
```

### Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Let's update the payoff matrix for Contract 1:
```
                 | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1
------------------------------------------
Player 1 A0      | (12, 8)      | (2, 18)
Player 1 A1      | (4, 4)       | (2, 2)
```

### Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments in either direction.

Let's update the payoff matrix for Contract 2:
```
                 | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1
------------------------------------------
Player 1 A0      | (15, 5)     | (5, 15)
Player 1 A1      | (6, 2)      | (4, 4)
```

### Analysis based on Payoff Matrices:
- **Contract 1:**
    - A0 yields better outcomes in both cases for Player 1 compared to the original game.
    - Risk associated: Choosing A1 under Contract 1 becomes much less appealing due to the reduction in points from the original (6, 2) to (4, 4) or (2, 2).

- **Contract 2:**
    - A0 yields even larger benefits (15, 5 or 5, 15) compared to the original and Contract 1.
    - A1 stays the same as the original setup.
    - More significant benefits for choosing A0, without penalizing A1, could be advantageous depending on the opponent's choices.

### Conclusion:
1. **Contract 1** improves outcomes for A0 significantly but disincentivizes A1 strongly due to penalties.
2. **Contract 2** enhances rewards for A0 even more without any penalties for A1, making it very attractive.

Given that Contract 2 generally provides better outcomes without any penalties, it is the preferred option. However, Contract 1 is also beneficial in certain scenarios. 

Thus, I will approve both contracts as they offer an improvement over the baseline scenario, with a preference for Contract 2.

response:
To address the task, we'll need to evaluate both proposed contracts in terms of how they affect our potential points in the game. The goal is to maximize our total points, so we should approve a contract only if it is expected to increase our points.

### Original Payoff Matrix 

Without any contract:
- If both choose A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
- If both choose A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.

### Proposed Contracts

**Contract 1 by Player 1:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

**Contract 2 by Player 2 (you):**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 points, distributed equally among the other players.

### Evaluating Contract 1

Under Contract 1:
- If both choose A0: You get 10 + 2 = 12 points, the other player gets 10 + 2 = 12 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 - 2 = 18 points, the other player gets 0 + 2 = 2 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 + 2 = 4 points, the other player gets 6 - 2 = 4 points.
- If both choose A1: You get 4 - 2 = 2 points, the other player gets 4 - 2 = 2 points.

### Evaluating Contract 2

Under Contract 2:
- If both choose A0: You get 10 + 10 = 20 points, the other player gets 10 + 10 = 20 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 - 10 = 10 points, the other player gets 0 + 10 = 10 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 + 10 = 12 points, the other player gets 6 - 10 = -4 points (though scores less than 0 would realistically mean 0 in practice).
- If both choose A1: You get 4 - 10 = -6 points, the other player gets 4 - 10 = -6 points (again, scores less than 0 would be floored to 0).

### Decision Analysis

Comparing the outcomes:
- **Contract 1** relatively balances the cost (2 points) for choosing A1 and benefit (2 points) for choosing A0. There's a slight encouragement to choose A0 but not too dramatic.
- **Contract 2** heavily incentivizes choosing A0 with a significant additional payment (10 points) and severely penalties choosing A1. This contract dramatically shifts the balance towards A0.

Given the high potential to earn from choosing A1 without extra penalties in **Contract 1**, compared to the severe penalty for A1 in **Contract 2**, **Contract 1** is typically more beneficial for us.

### Approval Decision
Here's the decision for the contracts:
```json
{
  "C1": true, 
  "C2": false
}
```
We approve Contract 1, as it maximizes our points better under possible outcomes. Contract 2 is disapproved due to the harsh penalties for A1, which can significantly reduce points in scenarios of mutual A1 choices.

To determine which contracts to approve, we need to evaluate how each contract impacts our total expected points in comparison to the default game scenario.

### Default Game Scenario (No Contract)
1. **Both Choose A0:** (10, 10)
2. **You Choose A0, Other Chooses A1:** (0, 20)
3. **You Choose A1, Other Chooses A0:** (6, 2)
4. **Both Choose A1:** (4, 4)

### Contract C1 Analysis (Proposed by You)
- **A0:** +2 points from the other player (net gain: +2)
- **A1:** -2 points to the other player (net loss: -2)

Let's re-evaluate the payoffs:
1. **Both Choose A0:** 
   - You: 10 (game) + 2 (contract) = 12 points
   - Other: 10 (game) - 2 (contract) = 8 points
  
2. **You Choose A0, Other Chooses A1:** 
   - You: 0 (game) + 2 (contract from choosing A0) = 2 points
   - Other: 20 (game) - 2 (contract for choosing A1) = 18 points

3. **You Choose A1, Other Chooses A0:** 
   - You: 6 (game) - 2 (contract for choosing A1) = 4 points
   - Other: 2 (game) + 2 (contract for choosing A0) = 4 points
  
4. **Both Choose A1:** 
   - You: 4 (game) - 2 (contract) = 2 points
   - Other: 4 (game) - 2 (contract) = 2 points

### Contract C2 Analysis (Proposed by Player 2)
- **A0:** +5 points from the other player (net gain: +5)
- **A1:** no change

Let's re-evaluate the payoffs:
1. **Both Choose A0:** 
   - You: 10 (game) + 5 (contract) = 15 points
   - Other: 10 (game) - 5 (contract) = 5 points
  
2. **You Choose A0, Other Chooses A1:** 
   - You: 0 (game) + 5 (contract from choosing A0) = 5 points
   - Other: 20 (game)  = 20 points

3. **You Choose A1, Other Chooses A0:** 
   - You: 6 (game) = 6 points
   - Other: 2 (game) - 5 (contract chosen A0) = -3 points
  
4. **Both Choose A1:** 
   - You: 4 (game) = 4 points
   - Other: 4 (game) = 4 points

### Decision Analysis
To maximize my points:
- Contract C1 shifts incentive towards mutual A0 choosing, but at the cost of reducing the points if I choose A1.
- Contract C2 significantly boosts my points when I choose A0 at the expense of the other player, which could create a higher incentive for the opponent to choose A1.

I will approve a contract that maximizes my expected gain:
- Contract C1 results in 12 points in the best cooperative scenario and 2 points in the worst.
- Contract C2 results in 15 points in the best cooperative scenario and 5 points in the worst unilateral scenario.
C2 amplifies the incentive to select A0. Thus, I will approve Contract C2 and reject Contract C1.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

response:
To decide which contracts to approve in this decision-making game, we need to evaluate how each proposed contract influences the expected payoffs according to the game rules and payoffs described. We aim to maximize our own points received.

Here's the breakdown of the process:

### Base Payoffs (Without Contract)
Under the basic rules, the payoffs are as follows:
- If both players select A0:
  - Player 1: 10 points
  - Player 2: 10 points
- If Player 1 selects A0 and Player 2 selects A1:
  - Player 1: 0 points
  - Player 2: 20 points
- If Player 1 selects A1 and Player 2 selects A0:
  - Player 1: 6 points
  - Player 2: 2 points
- If both players select A1:
  - Player 1: 4 points
  - Player 2: 4 points

### Contract Proposed by Player 1
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Evaluate the new payoffs:
- Both select A0:
  - Player 1: 12 points (10 + 2)
  - Player 2: 8 points (10 - 2)
- Player 1 selects A0, Player 2 selects A1:
  - Player 1: 2 points (0 + 2)
  - Player 2: 18 points (20 - 2)
- Player 1 selects A1, Player 2 selects A0:
  - Player 1: 4 points (6 - 2)
  - Player 2: 4 points (2 + 2)
- Both select A1:
  - Player 1: 2 points (4 - 2)
  - Player 2: 2 points (4 - 2)

### Contract Proposed by Player 2
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 3 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 13 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Evaluate the new payoffs:
- Both select A0:
  - Player 1: 13 points (10 + 3)
  - Player 2: 7 points (10 - 3)
- Player 1 selects A0, Player 2 selects A1:
  - Player 1: 3 points (0 + 3)
  - Player 2: 7 points (20 - 13)
- Player 1 selects A1, Player 2 selects A0:
  - Player 1: -7 points (6 - 13)
  - Player 2: 5 points (2 + 3)
- Both select A1:
  - Player 1: -9 points (4 - 13)
  - Player 2: -9 points (4 - 13)

### Analysis
- The contract proposed by Player 1 slightly benefits cooperation where both players select A0, and is somewhat balanced.
- The contract proposed by Player 2 heavily penalizes choosing A1, creating very unfavorable conditions for Player 1 in multiple scenarios.

Given that we aim to maximize our own payoff, the contract proposed by Player 1 is more favorable and less risky than Player 2's contract.

### Decision
Approve only the contract proposed by Player 1.

The JSON object reflecting this decision will be:
```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}
```
Here, "C1" represents the contract proposed by Player 1, and "C2" represents the contract proposed by Player 2.

response:
To make a decision on whether to sign the contract, we need to first understand the implications of signing the contract on our payoffs and then assess if signing is beneficial for us.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### Base Game Payoffs Without Contract
Let's recap the payoffs without the contract:
- If both players choose A0 (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 10 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0 (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 20 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1 (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 2 points.
- If both players choose A1 (A1, A1): Player 2 gets 4 points.

#### Payoffs With Contract
The contract introduces additional payments for each action:
- Choosing A0 gives an additional +2 points.
- Choosing A1 incurs a -2 points penalty.

Let's recompute the payoffs with the contract:

- If both players choose A0 (A0, A0):
  - Player 2: 10 (base) + 2 (contract) = 12 points.
  
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0 (A1, A0):
  - Player 2: 20 (base) - 2 (contract) = 18 points.

- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1 (A0, A1):
  - Player 2: 2 (base) + 2 (contract) = 4 points.

- If both players choose A1 (A1, A1):
  - Player 2: 4 (base) - 2 (contract) = 2 points.

#### Summary of Payoffs Changes
| Choice (Player 2, Player 1) | Without Contract | With Contract    |
|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| (A0, A0)                    | 10               | 12               |
| (A1, A0)                    | 20               | 18               |
| (A0, A1)                    | 2                | 4                |
| (A1, A1)                    | 4                | 2                |

Given this, we can compare the average expected payoffs:

1. Without the contract:
    - If both pick A0, (A0, A0) yields 10 points.
    - If Player 2 picks A1 and Player 1 picks A0, (A1, A0) yields 20 points.
    - If Player 2 picks A0 and Player 1 picks A1, (A0, A1) yields 2 points.
    - If both pick A1, (A1, A1) yields 4 points.

2. With the contract:
    - If both pick A0, (A0, A0) yields 12 points.
    - If Player 2 picks A1 and Player 1 picks A0, (A1, A0) yields 18 points.
    - If Player 2 picks A0 and Player 1 picks A1, (A0, A1) yields 4 points.
    - If both pick A1, (A1, A1) yields 2 points.

#### Conclusion
- When both players choose A0, the payoff increases from 10 to 12 with the contract.
- When Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0, the payoff decreases from 20 to 18.
- When Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1, the payoff increases from 2 to 4.
- When both players choose A1, the payoff decreases from 4 to 2.

Since the contract mainly discourages competitive actions (A1 with high payoffs), it promotes mutual cooperation, specifically when both players choose A0, maximizing total payoffs under cooperative scenarios.

Given our goal to maximize total points, the contract encourages both players to choose A0, leading to higher consistent payoffs.

### Final Decision
Since signing the contract is expected to yield a better cooperative outcome with higher points on average, it makes sense to sign the contract.

response:
To determine whether you should sign the contract, let's break down the decision process and evaluate the implications step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Payoff Matrix without the Contract

Initially, the payoffs according to the game's rules are:
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points.

### Step 2: Analyze the Contract's Impact on the Payoff Matrix

The contract adds/subtracts points depending on the actions chosen:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed to the other player.

The adjusted payoffs considering the contract are:
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get 10 points + 2 points = 12 points.
  - The other player gets 10 points + 2 points = 12 points.
  
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get 0 points + 2 points = 2 points.
  - The other player gets 20 points - 2 points = 18 points.
  
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get 6 points - 2 points = 4 points.
  - The other player gets 2 points + 2 points = 4 points.
  
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get 4 points - 2 points = 2 points.
  - The other player gets 4 points - 2 points = 2 points.

### Step 3: Compare Scenarios With and Without Contract

#### Without Contract
If you assume rationality and self-interest from both players:
- The dominant strategies would likely lean towards outcomes optimizing higher assured points (i.e., A0 may be more attractive due to mutual high returns).

#### With Contract
- Both players choosing A0 results in the highest total-score for both (12 points each).
- Choosing A0 has a base benefit increased, and choosing A1 has a penalty, inclining towards mutual cooperative behavior (both choosing A0).

### Step 4: Evaluate and Decide 

From the adjusted payoff matrix, signing the contract seems to benefit you and the other player if both choose A0 due to the additional 2 points reward (+12 instead of 10). It also makes A1 less attractive due to the 2 points penalty. The contract aligns incentives towards cooperative behavior (both choosing A0) which is in both players' best interest.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, signing the contract is beneficial as it enhances the overall points you can achieve if both players cooperate.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "sign": true
}
```

We have evaluated the implications step by step, analyzed the payoff impacts, and determined that signing the contract enhances your total potential score when you both choose the cooperative action A0. Thus, you should sign the contract.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 1, we need to consider both the basic game rules and the additional contract payment stipulations. Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Analyze the Basic Game Payoffs
From the basic game rules, the payoffs are as follows:
- If (Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A0): (10, 10)
- If (Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1): (0, 20)
- If (Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0): (6, 2)
- If (Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A1): (4, 4)

### Step 2: Analyze the Contract Effect
The additional contract modifies the payoffs as follows:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points to the other player.

### Modify the Payoffs Considering the Contract
Modified payoffs:
- If (Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A0):
  - Player 1: 10 + 2 = 12
  - Player 2: 10 + 2 = 12
- If (Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1):
  - Player 1: 0 + 2 = 2
  - Player 2: 20 - 2 = 18
- If (Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0):
  - Player 1: 6 - 2 = 4
  - Player 2: 2 + 2 = 4
- If (Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A1):
  - Player 1: 4 - 2 = 2
  - Player 2: 4 - 2 = 2

### Step 3: Determine the Optimal Strategy
Given the modified payoffs, let's create a payoff matrix for Player 1:

|              | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Player 1 A0** | (12, 12)    | (2, 18)      |
| **Player 1 A1** | (4, 4)      | (2, 2)       |

The expected payoffs for Player 1:
- If Player 1 chooses A0:
  - If Player 2 chooses A0: 12 points
  - If Player 2 chooses A1: 2 points

- If Player 1 chooses A1:
  - If Player 2 chooses A0: 4 points
  - If Player 2 chooses A1: 2 points

Player 1's dominant strategy is to choose the action that maximizes their payoff considering the likely actions Player 2 might take. The highest guaranteed payoff for Player 1 is 12 points if both choose A0. Since A0 can yield higher payoffs if both players choose it, Player 1 should prefer A0.

### Step 4: Final Decision
Given the analysis, Player 1 should lean towards A0 to maximize their average payoff. However, since pure strategies might not always be predictable, we suggest a high probability towards A0 with very minimal chance for A1 to account for any strategic diversification.

### Strategy Output
```json
{"A0": 90, "A1": 10}
```

This distribution favors A0 heavily, in light of the higher payoffs under the given contract and game rules.

   - Additional 2 points per the contract, making it 12 points total for each.
   
2. **If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0:**
   - You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
   - Per the contract, you lose 2 points and they gain 2 points.
   - You would end up with 18 points, and the other player with 2 points.

3. **If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1:**
   - You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
   - Per the contract, you gain 2 points and they lose 2 points.
   - You would end up with 4 points, and the other player with 4 points.

4. **If both choose A1:**
   - Both players get 4 points.

### Analyzing Rational Strategies:
- **Dominant Strategy Analysis:** It is useful to check if there's any dominant strategy for either player. A dominant strategy is one that yields a higher payoff irrespective of the opponent's decision.
- Comparing payoffs for **A1** and **A0**:
  - If the opponent chooses A0, you get 18 with A1 and 12 with A0 -> choosing A1 is better.
  - If the opponent chooses A1, you get 2 with A1 and 4 with A0 -> choosing A0 is better.

Since there isn't a clear dominant strategy under all circumstances, let’s consider what mix of strategies could be mutually beneficial.

### Mixed Strategy Explanation:
- The game has some elements of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, but the contract changes the incentives.
- The game allows for mixed (probabilistic) strategies to find an equilibrium where both players maximize their expected payoffs.

Given the contract, mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) yields the highest combined payoff (24 points combined), while mutual defection (choosing A1) yields the lowest (4 points combined).

### Ideal Strategy:
An ideal mixed strategy can balance mutually beneficial outcomes while mitigating the risk of the other player strictly defecting (choosing A1).

### Conclusion:
Allowing for mixed strategy probabilities that value cooperation:

```json
{"A0": 75, "A1": 25}
```

This approach encourages cooperation more (higher payoff if both cooperate), but leaves a fraction to defect occasionally to exploit potential purely cooperative play of the opponent (opportunistic strategy if the opponent always chooses A0).

Choosing the exact probabilities can be adjusted based on expected risk averseness and reads on the opponent's strategies, but starting with a cooperative-leaning strategy can be prudent given the setup.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
First, let's analyze the original game without any contracts:

- If both choose A0: Both get 10 points.
- If Player 2 (P2) chooses A1 and Player 1 (P1) chooses A0: P2 gets 20, P1 gets 0 points.
- If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1: P2 gets 2, P1 gets 6 points.
- If both choose A1: Both get 4 points.

Next, let's see how each contract changes the payoff matrix:

### Analyzing Contract proposed by Player 1:
1. If both choose A0:
   - P2 gets 10 (original) + 10 (payment) - 5 (payment to P1) = 15 points.
   - P1 gets 10 (original) + 10 (payment) - 5 (payment to P2) = 15 points.
   
2. If P2 chooses A1 and P1 chooses A0:
   - P2 gets 20 (original) = 20 points.
   - P1 gets 0 (original) + 10 (payment) - 5 (payment to P2) = 5 points.
   
3. If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1:
   - P2 gets 2 (original) + 10 (payment) - 5 (payment to P1) = 7 points.
   - P1 gets 6 (original) + 10 (payment) - 5 (payment to P2) = 11 points.
   
4. If both choose A1:
   - P2 gets 4 (original) = 4 points.
   - P1 gets 4 (original) = 4 points.

### Analyzing Contract proposed by Player 2:
1. If both choose A0:
   - P2 gets 10 (original) + 10 (payment) - 5 (payment to P1) = 15 points.
   - P1 gets 10 (original) + 10 (payment) - 5 (payment to P2) = 15 points.
   
2. If P2 chooses A1 and P1 chooses A0:
   - P2 gets 20 (original) - 10 (payment) + 5 (distribution from P1) = 15 points.
   - P1 gets 0 (original) + 5 (distribution payment from P2) = 5 points.
   
3. If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1:
   - P2 gets 2 (original) + 10 (payment) - 5 (payment to P1) = 7 points.
   - P1 gets 6 (original) - 10 (payment) + 5 (distribution from P2) = 1 point.
   
4. If both choose A1:
   - P2 gets 4 (original) - 10 (payment) + 5 (distribution from P1) = -1 points.
   - P1 gets 4 (original) - 10 (payment) + 5 (distribution from P2) = -1 points.

### Decision:
To maximize my points as Player 2 and incentivize a positive outcome, I need to consider which contract aligns best with this goal.

- Contract 1 makes A0 more attractive but doesn’t penalize A1.
  - Highest benefit for P2 is in A1-A0 situation (20 points) without a contract.

- Contract 2 makes A0 more attractive and penalizes A1.
  - Highest benefit for P2 is in A0-A0 (15 points).

Given the analysis, both contracts incentivize A0 in different ways, but Contract 2 explicitly penalizes A1, which provides a stronger incentive for mutual cooperation in my favor.

Thus, Player 2's contract is better for incentivizing a favorable outcome for me, while Player 1’s doesn't hinder as much but doesn’t penalize A1 equivalent actions.

My final approval would be:

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": true
}
```

response:
Contract C1 makes the other player strongly prefer **A0** (it becomes their dominant action), which in turn pushes the outcome to **(P1:A0, P2:A1)** where your payoff drops to **10** (down from 20 in the original game).

Contract C2 also makes the other player prefer **A0**, but under the resulting outcome **(P1:A0, P2:A1)** your payoff is **15**, which is better than under C1.

So I approve C2 and reject C1.

Step 1: Write the base payoff matrix (Player 2 = “me”, Player 1 = “other”)

- (A0, A0): (10, 10)  
- (A1, A0): (20, 0)  
- (A0, A1): (2, 6)  
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (±2 depending on action)

With 2 players, the contract implies:
- If I play A0: I get +2 taken from the other (other −2).
- If I play A1: I pay 2 to the other (I −2, other +2).

So:
- (A0, A0): each both “receive +2 from the other” → transfers cancel → still (10, 10)
- (A1, A1): each both “pay 2 to the other” → transfers cancel → still (4, 4)
- (A1, A0): I play A1 (pay 2), other plays A0 (receives 2) → total transfer 4 from me to other  
  (20, 0) → (16, 4)
- (A0, A1): total transfer 4 from other to me  
  (2, 6) → (6, 2)

So under C1 my best responses:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A1 (16 > 10)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (6 > 4)

Other player’s best responses:
- If I play A0: they prefer A0 (10 > 2)
- If I play A1: they are indifferent (4 = 4)

This yields a Nash equilibrium at (A1, A0), giving me **16**.

Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (A1 penalty of 5)

- A0: no transfer
- A1: chooser pays 5 to the other

Adjusted outcomes:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (20, 0) → (15, 5)
- (A0, A1): (2, 6) → (7, 1)
- (A1, A1): transfers cancel → (4, 4)

Best responses:
- Other player has a dominant strategy A0 (10 > 1 if I play A0; 5 > 4 if I play A1)
- Given other plays A0, I prefer A1 (15 > 10)

So Nash equilibrium is (A1, A0), giving me **15**.

Step 4: Approval choice

- C1 gives me 16 in equilibrium.
- C2 gives me 15 in equilibrium.

So I prefer C1 over C2. Also, approving C2 could make it more likely to be selected (via max approvals), which would hurt my expected payoff.

Final approvals:
```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}
```

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which contracts we, as **Player 2**, should approve.

We are Player 2 in this game, and we are deciding whether to approve two proposed contracts: C1 (proposed by Player 1) and C2 (proposed by Player 2). The final contract is chosen uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

Our goal is to **maximize our expected total points** over the entire game, considering both the base payoff and any additional payments from the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Payoff Matrix (Player 2 is the second player)

The base payoffs are:

| Your Action / Opponent's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                         | 10 (you) | 2 (you)  |
| **A1**                         | 20 (you) | 4 (you)  |

Let’s denote:
- You are Player 2.
- The other player is Player 1.

So, the joint payoffs are:

- (A0, A0): You get 10, Opponent gets 10
- (A1, A0): You get 20, Opponent gets 0
- (A0, A1): You get 2, Opponent gets 6
- (A1, A1): You get 4, Opponent gets 4

---

### Step 2: Analyze Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)

> **C1**:  
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+2** points, **drawn equally from the other player**.  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay **-2** points, **distributed equally among the other player**.

Let’s analyze this contract from **Player 2’s perspective**.

#### Interpretation:
- If **you (Player 2)** play **A0**, you gain **+2**, but the **other player (Player 1)** loses 2 (because the +2 is "drawn from the other player").
- If you play **A1**, you **lose 2**, and Player 1 gets +2.
- If Player 1 plays A0, they gain +2, and you lose 2.
- If Player 1 plays A1, they lose 2, and you gain +2.

So the **net effect** of the contract is that:
- Playing A0 → +2 (to self), -2 (from opponent)
- Playing A1 → -2 (to self), +2 (from opponent)

This is **symmetric** and **costs 2** to play A1, **gives 2** to play A0.

Let’s compute the **total payoff** (base + contract) for Player 2 in each scenario:

#### C1 Payoff for Player 2:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Base Payoff | Contract Effect (for you) | Total |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------|-------|
| A0          | A0                | 10          | +2 (you get 2 from opponent) | 12  |
| A0          | A1                | 2           | +2 (you get 2 from opponent)  | 4   |
| A1          | A0                | 20          | -2 (you lose 2 to opponent)   | 18  |
| A1          | A1                | 4           | -2 (you lose 2 to opponent)   | 2   |

Note: The contract payments are **per player**, and **distributed equally** — since there are two players, any payment "from the other player" affects the other player directly.

So:
- When you play A0 → +2 from opponent
- When you play A1 → -2 to opponent (i.e., you pay 2)
- When opponent plays A0 → you lose 2
- When opponent plays A1 → you gain 2

But **from your perspective**, you care about your own total.

So the **contract adjustments** depend on your own action and the opponent's action.

Let’s define:
- Contract effect on you =  
   +2 if **you play A0**,  
   -2 if **you play A1**,  
   **plus**  
   +2 if **opponent plays A1** (because opponent pays 2, which goes to you),  
   -2 if **opponent plays A0** (because opponent gains 2, which comes from you)

Wait — this is **critical**.

The contract says:
- "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2, drawn equally from the other player."
- "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2, distributed equally among the other players."

So the **"other players"** receive the payment.

Since there is only one other player, **"drawn equally"** just means **the entire payment comes from them**.

So, for **you (Player 2)**:
- If you play A0 → you get +2 from Player 1
- If you play A1 → you pay -2 (i.e., Player 1 gets +2)
- If Player 1 plays A0 → Player 1 gets +2 → **you lose 2**
- If Player 1 plays A1 → Player 1 pays -2 → **you gain +2**

So the **contract adjustment** for you is:

- You get: **+2 (if you play A0)** + **+2 (if opponent plays A1)**  
  → because when opponent plays A1, you receive 2.

- You **lose**: **-2 (if you play A1)** and **-2 (if opponent plays A0)**

So total contract adjustment =  
[+2 if you A0, -2 if you A1] + [+2 if opponent A1, -2 if opponent A0]

So the **total net contract adjustment** for Player 2 in each cell:

| You | Opp | Contract Adjustment |
|-----|-----|----------------------|
| A0 | A0 | +2 (you A0) - 2 (opp A0) = 0 |
| A0 | A1 | +2 (you A0) +2 (opp A1) = +4 |
| A1 | A0 | -2 (you A1) - 2 (opp A0) = -4 |
| A1 | A1 | -2 (you A1) +2 (opp A1) = 0 |

Now add this to base payoff:

| You | Opp | Base | Contract | Total |
|-----|-----|------|----------|-------|
| A0 | A0 | 10   | 0        | 10    |
| A0 | A1 | 2    | +4       | 6     |
| A1 | A0 | 20   | -4       | 16    |
| A1 | A1 | 4    | 0        | 4     |

So under **C1**, your total payoffs are:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A0,A1): 6
- (A1,A0): 16
- (A1,A1): 4

Now, we must consider **what your best-response strategy** is under this new payoff structure, assuming Player 1 also plays optimally.

But first, let's consider **C2**.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2 — yourself)

> **C2**:  
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of **11** points, **drawn equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, **no additional payments**.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get +11, Player 1 loses 11
- If you play A1 → no change
- If Player 1 plays A0 → they get +11 → you lose 11
- If Player 1 plays A1 → no effect

From **your POV (Player 2)**:
- Contract adjustment =  
   +11 if you play A0  
   -11 if Player 1 plays A0  
   (no effect if you play A1 or Player 1 plays A1)

So total adjustment:

| You | Opp | Adjustment |
|-----|-----|------------|
| A0 | A0 | +11 -11 = 0 |
| A0 | A1 | +11 + 0 = +11 |
| A1 | A0 | 0 -11 = -11 |
| A1 | A1 | 0 + 0 = 0 |

Now add to base payoffs:

| You | Opp | Base | Contract | Total |
|-----|-----|------|----------|-------|
| A0 | A0 | 10   | 0        | 10    |
| A0 | A1 | 2    | +11      | 13    |
| A1 | A0 | 20   | -11      | 9     |
| A1 | A1 | 4    | 0        | 4     |

So under **C2**, your payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A0,A1): 13
- (A1,A0): 9
- (A1,A1): 4

---

### Step 4: Compare Contracts C1 and C2 from Player 2’s Perspective

We need to **predict how both players will behave under each contract**, **assuming rational play**, and then **compute expected utility** under each scenario.

But the **contract is only in effect if it is approved**, and **only one contract wins**, selected at random from those with the **most approvals**.

So we must **strategically approve contracts** to **maximize our expected payoff**.

But we can only approve **C1** or **C2**.

Let’s analyze the **impact** of each contract on **Player 1's incentives**, since they will play optimally.

---

### Step 5: Analyze Incentives and Equilibria under Each Contract

#### Goal: Predict best responses to maximize expected payoff for **you (Player 2)**.

---

#### Option 1: Assume **C1** is in effect

Payoffs for **Player 2**:
| Opponent/A2 | A0 (you) | A1 (you) |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| A0 (P1)     | 10       | 16       |
| A1 (P1)     | 6        | 4        |

So Player 2’s best response:
- If Opponent plays A0: you prefer **A1 (16 > 10)**
- If Opponent plays A1: you prefer **A0 (6 > 4)**

So your best response is **opposite** of opponent.

Now check Player 1’s payoffs under C1.

Let’s compute **Player 1’s total payoff (including contract)**.

For Player 1:
- +2 if they play A0 → gets +2
- -2 if they play A1 → pays 2
- -2 if you (P2) play A0 → they lose 2
- +2 if you (P2) play A1 → they gain 2

So contract adjustment for P1:
- +2 if they play A0
- -2 if they play A1
- -2 if you play A0
- +2 if you play A1

So:

| P1 / P2 | A0 (you) | A1 (you) |
|---------|----------|----------|
| A0 (P1) | +2 -2 = 0 | -2 -2 = -4 |
| A1 (P1) | +2 +2 = +4 | -2 +2 = 0 |

Now base payoffs (from original game):

- (A0,A0): P1 gets 10
- (A1,A0): P1 gets 0
- (A0,A1): P1 gets 6
- (A1,A1): P1 gets 4

Now add contract adjustments:

| P1 / P2 | A0 (you) | A1 (you) |
|---------|----------|----------|
| A0      | 10 + 0 = 10 | 0 + (-4) = -4 |
| A1      | 6 + 4 = 10 | 4 + 0 = 4 |

So Player 1’s total payoff under C1:

- (A0,A0): 10
- (A1,A0): -4
- (A0,A1): 10
- (A1,A1): 4

Best responses for P1:
- If you play A0: P1 prefers A0 (10 vs -4)
- If you play A1: P1 prefers A0 (10 vs 4)

So **Player 1 will always play A0** under C1.

Now, your best response to P1 playing A0 is: A1 (16 > 10)

So **equilibrium under C1**:  
- P1 plays A0 (because it's dominant)
- You play A1 (best response)

Payoff: **You get 16**, P1 gets -4

This is stable.

So under **C1**, equilibrium outcome is (A1, A0) → **you get 16 points**

---

#### Option 2: Assume **C2** is in effect

Your payoffs:
| P1 / P2 | A0 (you) | A1 (you) |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | 10       | 9        |
| A1     | 13       | 4        |

So for you:
- If P1 plays A0: you prefer A0 (10 vs 9)
- If P1 plays A1: you prefer A0 (13 vs 4)

So **you always prefer A0**, regardless of P1.

Now check **Player 1’s payoffs** under C2.

Player 1:
- If they play A0 → +11
- If they play A1 → 0
- If you play A0 → they lose 11
- If you play A1 → 0

So contract adjustment for P1:
- +11 if they A0
- -11 if you A0

Base payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A1,A0): 0
- (A0,A1): 6
- (A1,A1): 4

Now add contract:

| P1 / P2 | A0 (you) | A1 (you) |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | 10 + 11 -11 = 10 | 0 + 11 + 0 = 11 |
| A1     | 6 + 0 -11 = -5 | 4 + 0 + 0 = 4 |

So P1’s total:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A1,A0): 11
- (A0,A1): -5
- (A1,A1): 4

Best responses:
- If you play A0: P1 prefers A1 (11 vs 10)
- If you play A1: P1 prefers A1 (4 vs -5)

So **P1 always prefers A1**, no matter what.

But **you always prefer A0**, no matter what.

Conflict.

So best response cycle:
- You want A0 → P1 wants A1
- You want A0 → P1 wants A1
- So no pure strategy equilibrium.

Now consider **mixed strategies**.

Let:
- You play A0 with probability p
- P1 plays A0 with probability q

But since **you** always prefer A0 **if P1 plays A0**, and **want A0** if P1 plays A1, and **P1 always prefers A1**, we need to find a **mixed strategy equilibrium**.

But let’s think: **you want A0**, **P1 wants A1**.

So likely equilibrium: **you randomize, P1 plays A1 with high probability**.

Compute expected payoff for you under C2:

You: choose p = prob(A0)

P1: choose q = prob(A0)

Payoff:
= p * q * 10 + p * (1-q) * 13 + (1-p) * q * 9 + (1-p) * (1-q) * 4

Now since P1 is rational, they will choose q to maximize their own payoff.

P1’s payoff is:
= q * (10) + (1-q) * 11   if you play A0 → but we need to condition on your p?

Wait: we should compute P1’s expected payoff given your p.

P1’s payoff:
= q * [if you A0: 11 (from contract) + base payoffs] → wait, better to recompute.

From above:
- P1’s payoff:
  - (A0,A0): 10
  - (A1,A0): 11
  - (A0,A1): -5
  - (A1,A1): 4

But P1 gets:
- 10 if (A0,A0)
- 11 if (A1,A0)
- -5 if (A0,A1)
- 4 if (A1,A1)

So expected payoff for P1 given:
- Probability of (A0,A0) = q * p → payoff 10
- (A1,A0) = (1-q) * p → payoff 11
- (A0,A1) = q * (1-p) → payoff -5
- (A1,A1) = (1-q)(1-p) → payoff 4

So E[P1] =  
10 q p + 11 (1-q) p + (-5) q (1-p) + 4 (1-q)(1-p)

We can simplify:
= p [10q + 11(1-q)] + (1-p) [ -5q + 4(1-q) ]
= p [10q + 11 - 11q] + (1-p) [ -5q + 4 - 4q ]
= p [11 - q] + (1-p) [4 - 9q]

Now P1 will choose q to maximize this, for a fixed p.

But since they **always prefer A1**, let's check if q=0 is optimal.

If q=0:
E[P1] = p [11] + (1-p)[4] = 11p + 4(1-p) = 7p + 4

If q=1:
E[P1] = p [11-1] + (1-p)[4-9] = 10p -5(1-p) = 10p -5 + 5p = 15p -5

Compare 7p + 4 and 15p -5:
Set 7p + 4 > 15p -5 → 4 +5 > 8p → 9 > 8p → p < 1.125 → always true

So for all p ∈ [0,1], 7p + 4 > 15p -5

So **q=0 is better than q=1**, for all p.

Now check if q=0 is optimal, and no interior point.

Let’s take derivative of E[P1] w.r.t. q:

E[P1] = p(11 - q) + (1-p)(4 - 9q)  
= 11p - p q + 4(1-p) -9(1-p)q  
= 11p + 4 - 4p - q [ p + 9(1-p) ]  
= 7p + 4 - q [p + 9 - 9p]  
= 7p + 4 - q (9 - 8p)

Now derivative w.r.t. q: - (9 - 8p)

Which is **negative** when 9 - 8p > 0 → p < 9/8 → always true.

So function is **decreasing in q** → so **P1 maximizes payoff by choosing q=0**

So **P1 plays A1 with probability 1**

Now, given that P1 plays A1, you will play A0 (because 13 > 4)

So **equilibrium** under C2:  
- P1 plays A1 (dominant)  
- You play A0

Outcome: (A0, A1) → your total payoff: **13**

(From earlier: you get 13 under C2)

So under **C2**, equilibrium outcome is (A0, A1), you get **13 points**

---

### Step 6: Compare Outcomes

| Contract | Your Payoff (Equilibrium) | Why |
|--------|----------------------------|-----|
| C1     | 16                         | (A1,A0): you get 16 |
| C2     | 13                         | (A0,A1): you get 13 |

So **C1 gives you higher payoff (16 vs 13)**

But wait — **can you approve both?**

We can approve **any set** of contracts, but the **winning contract** is chosen uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So if **both C1 and C2 are approved**, then **both are eligible**, and one is chosen at random.

So your **expected payoff** would be:

E[payoff] = (1/2)*16 + (1/2)*13 = 8 + 6.5 = **14.5**

But if **only C1** is approved, then C1 wins for sure, you get **16**

If **only C2** is approved, you get **13**

If **neither** is approved, then **no contract**, so game reverts to original.

But the problem says: **"a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process."**

So **if no contract is approved**, the original game is played without contract.

So we should also **consider the original game**.

---

### Step 7: Original Game (No Contract)

In the original game, your payoffs:

| Opp / You | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| A0        | 10 | 20 |
| A1        | 2  | 4  |

So:
- If opponent plays A0 → you prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If opponent plays A1 → you prefer A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 is dominant for you**

Now Player 1:
Payoffs:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A1,A0): 0
- (A0,A1): 6
- (A1,A1): 4

So:
- If you play A0 → P1 wants A0 (10 > 6)
- If you play A1 → P1 wants A0 (0 > 4? No: 0 < 4 → so prefers A1)

Wait:
- (A1,A0): P1 gets 0
- (A1,A1): P1 gets 4 → so prefers A1

So:
- If you play A0 → P1 prefers A0 (10 > 6)
- If you play A1 → P1 prefers A1 (4 > 0)

So P1’s best response is **same as yours** → so pure equilibrium: both play A1?

Check:

- You play A1 → P1 best responses: A1
- P1 plays A1 → you best response: A1

Yes → **(A1,A1)** is NE → you get 4

Alternatively, if both play A0: (10,10), but that’s not equilibrium because you want to deviate to A1.

So only NE is (A1,A1) → **you get 4**

But is there mixed strategy?

Suppose you mix with probability p.

For P1 to mix, must be indifferent between A0 and A1.

P1’s payoff:
- A0: p*10 + (1-p)*0 = 10p
- A1: p*6 + (1-p)*4 = 6p + 4 -4p = 2p + 4

Set equal: 10p = 2p + 4 → 8p = 4 → p = 0.5

Then for you to mix, P1 must be indifferent.

Your payoff:
- A0: q*10 + (1-q)*2 = 10q + 2 -2q = 8q + 2
- A1: q*20 + (1-q)*4 = 20q + 4 -4q = 16q + 4

Set equal: 8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → 2 - 4 = 8q → -2 = 8q → q = -0.25 → impossible

So you never mix — **A1 strictly dominant**

So equilibrium: (A1, A1) → **you get 4**

But this is **worse** than in C1 (16) or C2 (13)

So **original game gives you only 4** — so we prefer **any contract**.

---

### Step 8: Back to Approval Strategy

We must decide whether to approve C1 and/or C2.

We want to **maximize our expected payoff**, considering:

- Outcome if C1 wins: you get 16
- Outcome if C2 wins: you get 13
- Outcome if no contract: you get 4

The winning contract is chosen **uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So possibilities:

1. **Approve C1 only**:  
   - C1 has 1 approval → wins → you get 16

2. **Approve C2 only**:  
   - C2 has 1 approval → wins → you get 13

3. **Approve both C1 and C2**:  
   - Both have 2 approvals → both qualify → one chosen at random → your expected payoff: (16 + 13)/2 = **14.5**

4. **Approve neither**:  
   - No contract → you get 4

So best is **approve both** → gives **14.5**, which is better than **16**? No — 14.5 < 16

Wait: **14.5 < 16**, so approving **only C1** gives **16**, which is higher than **14.5**

So why approve both?

Because if you approve both, and both get 2 approvals, **one is randomly chosen** → you get **14.5 on average**, which is **less than 16**.

But what if the other player has incentives?

Ah — **this is key**.

We are not the only one. The other player (Player 1) also approves or disapproves.

But **we don’t know their preferences**.

We are Player 2, and we **are told** that C1 is proposed by Player 1, C2 by Player 2 (you).

We must **decide our own approvals**, but the **outcome depends on both players' choices**.

But the question says: **"Return a valid JSON object with your approvals"** — we only control **our own approvals**.

We assume that the **other player (Player 1)** will also try to **maximize their own payoff**, and we must anticipate their behavior.

So we cannot assume they approve C1 or C2 — we need to consider what they would do.

This changes everything.

We are missing this **strategic interaction in approval**.

So we must **simulate the approval game**.

Let’s denote:

- You (Player 2): decide to approve or not C1 and C2
- Player 1: decides to approve or not C1 and C2

We are only outputting **our** approvals.

But we must choose them to **maximize our expected payoff**, **taking into account** Player 1's rational behavior.

---

### Step 9: Model Approval Game

Each player independently approves some contracts.

After approvals, the winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from those with **maximum number of approvals**.

Your payoff depends on which contract wins.

Let’s analyze Player 1's preferences.

Player 1 prefers the contract where they get higher payoff.

Let’s compute **Player 1’s payoff** under C1 and C2.

We already computed:

#### Under C1:
We found equilibrium: (A1, A0) → P1 gets **-4**

Is this the only equilibrium? Yes — P1 plays A0, you play A1.

P1 gets -4 → very bad.

So **Player 1 strongly dislikes C1**.

#### Under C2:
Equilibrium: (A0, A1) → you get 13, P1 gets?

From earlier:

- P1 payoff: (A0,A1) → base: 6 → contract: P1 gets +11 (because they play A0? No: they play A1 → no payment)

Wait: in C2:
- If a player chooses A0 → gets +11 from opponent
- A1 → no additional payment

So if P1 plays A1 → no payoff from contract.

And you play A0 → so P1 loses 11 (because you playing A0 causes P1 to lose 11)

Base payoff: in (A0, A1): P1 gets **6**

Contract: P1 pays nothing, but you playing A0 → P1 loses 11

So **P1 total: 6 - 11 = -5**

So under C2: P1 gets **-5**

Still bad.

Wait — both C1 and C2 seem bad for P1?

But earlier:

Under C1, P1 payoff was -4

Under C2, P1 payoff was -5

But original game: P1 gets 4

So both contracts are worse for P1 than no contract.

So **Player 1 will **not** approve any contract**?

Because:
- C1: P1 gets -4 < 4 → worse
- C2: P1 gets -5 < 4 → worse

So **Player 1 will disapprove both contracts**

Therefore, **regardless of what we do**, **Player 1 approves neither C1 nor C2**

So maximum approvals:
- If we approve C1: C1 has 1 approval (only us), C2 has 0 → C1 wins → you get 16
- If we approve C2: C2 has 1 approval, C1 has 0 → C2 wins → you get 13
- If we approve both: C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → both have same max approval (1), so one wins at random → expected payoff: 14.5

But Player 1 approves neither → so our approval is all that matters.

So options:
- Approve C1: you get 16
- Approve C2: you get 13
- Approve both: you get 14.5
- Approve neither: no contract → you get 4

So best is: **approve C1 only**

But wait — is C1 really better?

C1 gives you 16

C2 gives you 13

Yes.

But is it possible that Player 1 might approve C1?

Let’s double-check P1’s payoff under C1.

Under C1: equilibrium is (A1, A0)

P1 plays A0, you play A1

P1’s total payoff:
- Base: (A1,A0): 0
- Contract: P1 plays A0 → gains +2
- You play A1 → you pay -2 → so P1 gains +2

So total: 0 + 2 + 2 = **4**

Earlier I said P1 gets -4 — that was **wrong**!

I made a mistake.

Let me correct.

Under C1, for P1:
- Base payoff: 0 (from (A1,A0))
- Contract: P1 plays A0 → +2
- You play A1 → you pay 2 → P1 gains +2
- So total: 0 + 2 + 2 = **4**

Similarly, in (A1,A1): P1 gets base 4, contract: plays A1 → pays 2, you play A1 → you get +2 → P1 loses 2 → 4 -2 = 2

So under C1, P1's payoffs:

| P1 / You | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 10 + 2 - 2 = 10? Wait: no.

Clarify:

For P1:
- If P1 plays A0 → +2
- If P1 plays A1 → -2
- If you play A0 → P1 loses 2 (because you get +2 from P1)
- If you play A1 → P1 gains +2

So:
- (A0,A0): P1 plays A0: +2; you play A0: -2 → net 0; base: 10 → total 10
- (A1,A0): P1 plays A1: -2; you play A0: -2 → net -4; base: 0 → total -4
- (A0,A1): P1 plays A0: +2; you play A1: +2 → net +4; base: 6 → total 10
- (A1,A1): P1 plays A1: -2; you play A1: +2 → net 0; base: 4 → total 4

Ah! I had this wrong earlier.

So P1's payoffs under C1:
- (A0,A0): 10
- (A1,A0): -4
- (A0,A1): 10
- (A1,A1): 4

So if you play A0: P1 prefers A0 (10 > -4)
If you play A1: P1 prefers A0 (10 > 4)

So P1 plays A0.

You, playing A1 (16 > 10) → so (A1,A0)

P1's total: -4

Yes, **P1 gets -4** under C1.

Which is worse than original 4.

So P1 dislikes C1.

Under C2: (A0,A1) → P1 plays A1 → no contract payment; you play A0 → P1 loses 11 → base 6 → total -5

Also worse than original 4.

So **Player 1 will disapprove both contracts**, because they get less than in original game.

Therefore, **only you can approve**, and Player 1 approves **nothing**.

Now, if you approve C1: C1 has 1 approval → wins → you get **16**

If you approve C2: C2 wins → you get **13**

If you approve both: both have 1 approval → one chosen at random → expected payoff: (16 + 13)/2 = 14.5

So best is to **approve C1 only**

You get 16

Any other option gives less.

Therefore, you should **approve C1**, and **not approve C2**

Final answer:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}
```

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Original Payoff Matrix:**

   Let's write down the payoffs for both players in a matrix format:
   
   |               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
   | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
   | Player 1: A0  | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
   | Player 1: A1  | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |
   
   Here, the first value in each pair is the payoff for Player 1 (you) and the second value is the payoff for Player 2.

2. **Understanding the Contract Impact:**

   According to the contract:
   
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points, drawn equally from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points, distributed equally among the other player.
   
   Thus, the new payoffs under the contract would be:
   
   |               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
   | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
   | Player 1: A0  | (12, 8)      | (2, 18)      |
   | Player 1: A1  | (4, 4)       | (2, 2)       |
   
   The entries in parentheses are (Player 1 points, Player 2 points).

3. **Analyzing the Impact of Signing the Contract:**

   Let's determine if signing the contract benefits Player 1 by examining the new payoffs.

   - Without the contract:
     - If both choose A0: (10, 10)
     - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: (0, 20)
     - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: (6, 2)
     - If both choose A1: (4, 4)

   - With the contract:
     - If both choose A0: (12, 8)
     - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: (2, 18)
     - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: (4, 4)
     - If both choose A1: (2, 2)

   The contract modifies the payoff matrix in a way that Player 1 earns:
   - More points when both players choose A0 (12 instead of 10).
   - Some points when Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0 (2 instead of 0).
   - Fewer points when Player 1 and Player 2 choose A1 (2 instead of 4).
   
4. **Comparing Payoffs:**

   If Player 1 believes the other player will often choose A1 to maximize their payoff, Player 1's best response will be to mix between actions. 
   
   However, with the contract, choosing A1 is less appealing compared to choosing A0 since the points gained by Player 1 when choosing A1 against any choice (A0 or A1) by Player 2 decrease significantly.

5. **Decision to Sign the Contract:**

   Signing the contract makes it more attractive for both players to choose A0. If both players believe the other player will sign the contract, the overall result is beneficial due to better coordination.

Therefore, given that the contract increases the expected payoff for Player 1 in likely scenarios, it makes sense for Player 1 to sign the contract.

response:
To make a decision on whether to sign the contract, let's break down the steps and carefully analyze the potential payoffs with and without the contract.

### Step 1: Understand the original payoffs
First, let’s recap the payoffs in the absence of the contract:
- (A0, A0) -> (10, 10)
- (A0, A1) -> (0, 20)
- (A1, A0) -> (6, 2)
- (A1, A1) -> (4, 4)

### Step 2: Understand the contract’s impact
If the contract is signed, the payoffs are modified as follows:
- Choose A0: +2 points
- Choose A1: -2 points

### Step 3: Calculate the new payoffs with the contract
Let’s compute the adjusted payoffs for each outcome with the contract applied:
- (A0, A0): (12, 12)
- (A0, A1): (2, 18)
- (A1, A0): (4, 4)
- (A1, A1): (2, 2)

### Step 4: Compare the strategies
Now, let’s analyze the potential strategies.

Without the contract:
- If Player 2 chooses A0, choosing A0 gives us 10 points (best response).
- If Player 2 chooses A1, choosing A1 gives us 6 points (better than 0 points from A0).

With the contract:
- If Player 2 chooses A0, choosing A0 gives us 12 points (best response).
- If Player 2 chooses A1, choosing A0 gives us 2 points, while A1 gives 2 points too. But the contract makes us indifferent between A0 and A1 since the payoffs are weaker.

### Step 5: Decision-making support
By signing the contract, we incentivize both players to choose A0, which yields the highest collective payoff (12, 12) instead of settling for (10, 10) in the original game.

The contract aligns both players towards a cooperative strategy where they both choose A0 due to the higher combined payoff. Thus, from a rational perspective, it is beneficial to sign the contract.

### Final Answer
We should sign the contract as it yields a better payoff structure that encourages mutual cooperation and higher points for both players. Here's the JSON output:

```json
{"sign": true}

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:

- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game
The payoff matrix (Me, Other):
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

## Step 2: Analyze each contract's effect

**Contract 1 (C1):**
A0 gives +10 from opponent, A1 has no payment.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10) - both pay/receive, nets out
- (A0, A1): (0+10, 20-10) = (10, 10)
- (A1, A0): (6-10, 2+10) = (-4, 12)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Under C1, I have a dominant strategy to play A0 (gives 10 vs -4 or 4).
Expected equilibrium outcome: **I get 10 points**

**Contract 2 (C2):**
A1 pays -5 to opponent, A0 has no payment.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0+5, 20-5) = (5, 15)
- (A1, A0): (6-5, 2+5) = (1, 7)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4) - payments cancel

Under C2, I have a dominant strategy to play A0. Opponent best responds with A1.
Expected equilibrium outcome: **I get 5 points**

**No contract:**
Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1).
Expected outcome: **I get 4 points**

## Step 3: Rank my preferences
C1 (10 points) > C2 (5 points) > No contract (4 points)

## Step 4: Strategic voting analysis

Player 2's perspective:
- C2 gives them 15 points (best)
- C1 gives them 10 points (good)
- No contract gives them 4 points (worst)

Player 2 will likely approve both contracts since both are better than no contract.

**If I approve only C1:**
- If P2 approves both: C1 gets 2 votes, C2 gets 1 → C1 wins → **10 points for me**
- If P2 approves only C2: C1 gets 1, C2 gets 1 → Random selection → **7.5 expected**
- If P2 approves only C1: C1 wins → **10 points for me**

**If I approve both C1 and C2:**
- If P2 approves both: Both get 2 votes → Random selection → **7.5 expected**
- If P2 approves only C2: C2 gets 2 votes → C2 wins → **5 points for me**

Approving only C1 dominates approving both, as it either guarantees C1 (my best outcome) or ensures equal footing for randomization.

response:
To determine the optimal probabilities for choosing between the actions A0 and A1, I need to analyze the payoff matrix and the additional contract to see which combination maximizes my total expected points.

1. Let's first rewrite the payoff matrix, incorporating the points from the contract:

- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: 
  - You: 10 + 2 = 12 points
  - Other player: 10 + 2 = 12 points

- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: 
  - You: 0 + 2 = 2 points
  - Other player: 20 - 2 = 18 points

- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: 
  - You: 6 - 2 = 4 points
  - Other player: 2 + 2 = 4 points

- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: 
  - You: 4 - 2 = 2 points
  - Other player: 4 - 2 = 2 points

2. With the new payoffs, the expected points for each action can be derived by considering how the other player might choose their actions. If I denote \( p \) as the probability that I (Player 1) choose A0 and \( 1-p \) as the probability that I choose A1, then I also need to consider the other player's strategy.

However, without knowing how the other player will definitively act, a common approach in game theory is to assume a mixed strategy equilibrium where each player is indifferent between their choices, given the mixed strategy of the other player.

Let's set the probabilities as:

- \( p \) = Probability of choosing A0
- \( 1 - p \) = Probability of choosing A1

Similarly, let the other player have probabilities \( q \) for choosing A0 and \( 1-q \) for choosing A1.

3. To maximize the expected payoff, we need to equalize my expected payoffs between choosing A0 and choosing A1, assuming the other player does the same for their choices.

Expected payoff choosing A0:
\[ E(A0) = 12q + 2(1-q) \]

Expected payoff choosing A1:
\[ E(A1) = 4q + 2(1-q) \]

Setting \( E(A0) \) equal to \( E(A1) \):
\[ 12q + 2 - 2q = 4q + 2 - 2q \]
\[ 10q + 2 = 2 \]
\[ 10q = 0 \]
\[ q = 0 \]

So, the expected payoffs are only balanced if the other player always chooses A1 (\( q = 0 \)), but this is a simplification and real strategies often consider both players differentiating.

Given the symmetrical nature and payoffs leading towards choosing A0 being more beneficial (12 or 2 points, versus 4 or 2 points for A1), let's opt for maximizing the higher average benefits by leaning towards A0.

Hence, assigning a high probability for A0 while keeping a minor mix for option diversity, but mostly focusing A0.

A practical mixed strategy might therefore look something like:

\[ \text{Prob}(A0) = 75\% \]
\[ \text{Prob}(A1) = 25\% \]

**Final Answer:**
```json
{"A0": 75, "A1": 25}
```

This strategy aims to balance between the highest payoff and variability due to the other player's strategies.

response:
Let's work through this step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Payoffs without Contract**:
   - If both players choose A0, both get 10 points each.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 0 points and Player 2 gets 20 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 6 points and Player 2 gets 2 points.
   - If both players choose A1, both get 4 points each.

2. **Understand the Contract**:
   - With the contract, if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

3. **Calculate the New Payoffs with the Contract**:
   - If both players choose A0:
     - Both get 10 points each, plus an additional 5 points each from the contract, minus 5 points each from their payment to the other player, resulting in 10 points each (no net change compared to the original game).
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
     - Player 1 gets 0 points, but with the contract, they receive an additional 5 points, making it 5 points in total.
     - Player 2 gets 20 points, but with the contract, they pay 5 points to Player 1, making it 15 points in total.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
     - Player 1 gets 6 points, and Player 2 gets 2 points. With the contract, Player 2 also gets 5 additional points with no negative effect on Player 1.
     - Player 1 ends up with 6 points.
     - Player 2 ends up with 7 points.
   - If both players choose A1:
     - Both get 4 points each, with no additional changes from the contract.

4. **Analyze the Incentives**:
   - Without the contract, there are different Nash equilibria (i.e., combinations of strategies where neither player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy unilaterally). But the players might lean towards choosing A0 due to higher points overall.
   - With the contract, the Nash equilibria might change, as choosing A0 yields an addtional benefit. This could make A0 a dominant strategy, reducing the uncertainty for Player 1 in the outcomes.

5. **Decision**:
   - Given this analysis, Player 1 should consider whether the net effect of the contract aligns their outcomes and preferred strategies better. Overall, the contract makes it more likely that Player 2 will choose A0, potentially aligning both players towards a mutually beneficial equilibrium.

**Conclusion**: Based on the evaluation, signing the contract seems beneficial as it aligns incentives towards better payoff outcomes for both players.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the baseline game without contracts

In the original game, let me find the Nash equilibrium:

**For me (Player 1):**
- If other plays A0: I get 10 from A0 vs 6 from A1 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 0 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A1

**For Player 2:**
- If I play A0: They get 10 from A0 vs 20 from A1 → prefer A1
- If I play A1: They get 2 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → prefer A1

Player 2 has a dominant strategy (A1). Given this, I should play A1. 
**Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) with payoff of 4 points for me.**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With C1's payment structure:

**My payoffs under C1:**
- (A0, A0): 10 (base) + 10 (I get for A0) - 10 (I pay for their A0) = 10
- (A0, A1): 0 + 10 - 0 = 10
- (A1, A0): 6 + 0 - 10 = -4
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4

**A0 strictly dominates A1 for me** (10 > max(-4, 4))

**Player 2's payoffs under C1:**
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 - 10 = 10
- (A0, A1): 20 + 0 - 10 = 10
- (A1, A0): 2 + 10 - 0 = 12
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4

When I play A0 (my dominant strategy), Player 2 gets 10 from either action.

**Expected outcome: Both play A0, I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

With C2's payment structure:

**My payoffs under C2:**
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 - 10 = 10
- (A0, A1): 0 + 10 + 10 (from their A1 penalty) = 20
- (A1, A0): 6 - 10 - 10 = -14
- (A1, A1): 4 - 10 + 10 = 4

**A0 strictly dominates A1 for me** (min(10, 20) > max(-14, 4))

**Player 2's payoffs under C2:**
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 - 10 = 10
- (A0, A1): 20 - 10 - 10 = 0
- (A1, A0): 2 + 10 + 10 = 22
- (A1, A1): 4 - 10 + 10 = 4

**A0 dominates A1 for Player 2** (min(10, 22) > max(0, 4))

**Expected outcome: Both play A0, I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Decision

- **No contract:** 4 points
- **C1:** 10 points
- **C2:** 10 points

Both contracts give me 10 points, which is significantly better than 4 points without a contract. I should approve both to maximize the probability that a beneficial contract is implemented.

response:
To determine whether you should sign the contract, let's break down the situation and analyze it step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understand the Original Payoffs:**
   - If both players choose A0: You = 10, Other = 10
   - If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You = 20, Other = 0
   - If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You = 2, Other = 6
   - If both players choose A1: You = 4, Other = 4

2. **Understand the Contract Impact:**
   - If you choose A0, you receive an additional +10 points, taken equally from the other player.
   - If you choose A1, you pay an additional -10 points, given equally to the other player.

3. **Recalculate Payoffs with the Contract:**
   - If both players choose A0: You = 10 + 10 = 20, Other = 10 - 10 = 0
   - If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You = 20 - 10 = 10, Other = 0 + 10 = 10
   - If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You = 2 + 10 = 12, Other = 6 - 10 = -4
   - If both players choose A1: You = 4 - 10 = -6, Other = 4 + 10 = 14

4. **Evaluate the Strategies and Incentives:**
   - Without the contract:
     - Mutual cooperation (both A0) is the best joint strategy, providing 10 points each.
     - For mutual defection (both A1), each gets 4 points.
     - Defecting while the other cooperates (A1 vs A0) gives you 20 points but 0 for the other.
   - With the contract:
     - Mutual cooperation (both A0) is extremely favorable to you: you get 20, they get 0.
     - Mutual defection (both A1) severely disadvantages you: you get -6, they get 14.
     - Defecting while the other cooperates (A1 vs A0) is neutral: both get 10 points.
     - Cooperating while the other defects (A0 vs A1) severely disfavors the other: you get 12, they get -4.

5. **Consider the Equilibrium and Risk:**
   - If both players are rational and inclined to maximize their points:
     - Both choosing A0 maximizes your points (while zeroing out theirs under the contract).
     - Both choosing A1 severely penalizes you.
     - Given the contract, their rational choice may shift to A1 to avoid the heavy penalty of choosing A0.

### Conclusion:
- The contract heavily skews payoffs in your favor if both choose A0.
- However, it introduces a riskier scenario (A1 vs A1) where both players end up significantly worse off.
- The zero-sum nature of the contract may motivate the other player to defect (choose A1) since choosing A0 penalizes them heavily.

Given this analysis, the rational decision here would likely be to **not sign the contract** as the potential penalties and altered incentives could lead to a suboptimal equilibrium for you.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game (no contract)

Let me find the Nash equilibrium for the original game.

For the other player, comparing their payoffs:
- If I play A0: they get 10 (if A0) or 20 (if A1) → they prefer A1
- If I play A1: they get 2 (if A0) or 4 (if A1) → they prefer A1

The other player has a dominant strategy to play A1.

Given the other player plays A1:
- If I play A0: I get 0
- If I play A1: I get 4

So I should play A1.

**Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

Modified payoffs with +10/-10 payment for choosing A0:
- (A0, A0): I get 10+10-10=10, Other gets 10+10-10=10
- (A0, A1): I get 0+10-0=10, Other gets 20+0-10=10
- (A1, A0): I get 6+0-10=-4, Other gets 2+10-0=12
- (A1, A1): I get 4, Other gets 4

My best response analysis:
- If other plays A0: I get 10 (A0) vs -4 (A1) → play A0
- If other plays A1: I get 10 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → play A0

I always prefer A0.

Other player's best response when I play A0:
- They get 10 (A0) vs 10 (A1) → indifferent

**Nash equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

Modified payoffs with +5/-5 payment for choosing A0:
- (A0, A0): I get 10+5-5=10, Other gets 10+5-5=10
- (A0, A1): I get 0+5-0=5, Other gets 20+0-5=15
- (A1, A0): I get 6+0-5=1, Other gets 2+5-0=7
- (A1, A1): I get 4, Other gets 4

My best response analysis:
- If other plays A0: I get 10 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → play A0
- If other plays A1: I get 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → play A0

I always prefer A0.

Other player's best response when I play A0:
- They get 10 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → play A1

**Nash equilibrium: (A0, A1) → I get 5 points**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes and decide

- No contract: 4 points
- Contract 1: 10 points ✓ (best for me)
- Contract 2: 5 points

Contract 1 gives me the highest payoff. Even if the other player approves both contracts (since both are better than no contract for them), by approving only C1, I ensure C1 gets more approvals and is selected.

response:
Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Analyze the game equilibrium under each contract
2. Determine my expected payoff under each scenario
3. Decide which contracts to approve strategically

## Step 1: Analyze the base game (no contract)

Without any contract, let me find the Nash equilibrium:
- If I play A0 and other plays A1: I get 0 (very bad for me)
- If I play A1 and other plays A1: I get 4
- (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium - I get **4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

Modified payoffs with C1 (additional ±10 for choosing A0):
- (A0, A0): I get 10+10-10 = 10, other gets 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0+10 = 10, other gets 20-10 = 10
- (A1, A0): I get 6-10 = -4, other gets 2+10 = 12
- (A1, A1): I get 4, other gets 4

Analysis: 
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (10) over A1 (-4)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (10) over A1 (4)
- **A0 is dominant for me**, I always get **10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

Modified payoffs with C2 (additional ±5 for choosing A0):
- (A0, A0): I get 10+5-5 = 10, other gets 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0+5 = 5, other gets 20-5 = 15
- (A1, A0): I get 6-5 = 1, other gets 2+5 = 7
- (A1, A1): I get 4, other gets 4

Analysis:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (10) over A1 (1)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (5) over A1 (4)
- I always choose A0
- Given I choose A0, other prefers A1 (15) over A0 (10)
- Nash equilibrium is (A0, A1), I get **5 points**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- No contract: 4 points
- Contract 1: 10 points ✓ (best for me)
- Contract 2: 5 points

From the other player's perspective:
- No contract: 4 points
- Contract 1: 10 points
- Contract 2: 15 points ✓ (best for them)

## Step 5: Strategic approval decision

The other player prefers C2 and will likely approve it. I prefer C1.

If I approve only C1 and other approves only C2:
- Both contracts have 1 approval each
- Random selection between them
- Expected payoff: (10+5)/2 = 7.5 points

If I approve both contracts:
- If other approves C2: C2 gets 2 approvals, C1 gets 1 → C2 wins → I get 5 points (worse!)

By approving only C1, I either:
- Get C1 selected (10 points) if it gets more approvals, OR
- Get a 50/50 chance between C1 and C2 (7.5 expected) if tied

This is better than approving both, which increases C2's chances of winning outright.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 3 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 13 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
Looking at this problem, I need to analyze each contract's effect on the game equilibrium and determine which contracts benefit me (Player 2).

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

From my perspective as Player 2:
- (A0, A0): I get 10, Player 1 gets 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20, Player 1 gets 0  
- (A0, A1): I get 2, Player 1 gets 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4, Player 1 gets 4

In the base game, A1 dominates A0 for me (20 > 10 when they play A0, and 4 > 2 when they play A1). The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1), giving me only **4 points**.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With C1's transfers (+2 for A0, -2 for A1), the net transfers in each outcome are:
- (A0, A0): I get 10 + 0 = **10**
- (A1, A0): I get 20 - 4 = **16** (I pay 2, Player 1 receives 2 for choosing A0)
- (A0, A1): I get 2 + 4 = **6** (I receive 2, Player 1 pays 2)
- (A1, A1): I get 4 + 0 = **4**

The Nash equilibrium shifts to (A1, A0), where I get **16 points** (Player 1 gets 4).

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

With C2's transfers (+3 for A0, -13 for A1):
- (A0, A0): I get 10 + 0 = **10**
- (A1, A0): I get 20 - 16 = **4**
- (A0, A1): I get 2 + 16 = **18**
- (A1, A1): I get 4 + 0 = **4**

The heavy penalty on A1 makes A0 dominant for both players. The Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0), where I get **10 points**.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes and consider strategic voting

My payoffs:
- No contract: 4
- C1: 16 ✓ (best)
- C2: 10 ✓ (better than no contract)

Player 1's payoffs:
- No contract: 4
- C1: 4 (same)
- C2: 10 (strongly preferred)

## Step 5: Determine optimal voting strategy

Player 1 will likely approve only C2 (their best outcome). 

If I approve both contracts and Player 1 approves only C2:
- C2 has 2 approvals, C1 has 1 → C2 wins → I get 10

If I approve only C1 and Player 1 approves only C2:
- Both have 1 approval → Random selection → Expected payoff: 0.5(16) + 0.5(10) = **13**

By approving only C1, I create a tie that gives me a better expected outcome than if C2 wins outright.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
1) Incorporate the contract as payoff adjustments (2-player game, so transfers are entirely between the two players):
- If **you play A0**: you get **+2**; if **you play A1**: you get **-2**.
- If **other plays A0**: you lose **2** (funding them); if **other plays A1**: you gain **2** (they pay you).

2) Compute your (Player 2) contract-adjusted payoffs:
- (You A0, Other A0): 10 + (+2) + (-2) = **10**
- (You A1, Other A0): 20 + (-2) + (-2) = **16**
- (You A0, Other A1): 2 + (+2) + (+2) = **6**
- (You A1, Other A1): 4 + (-2) + (+2) = **4**

So against **Other = A0**, you prefer **A1** (16 > 10). Against **Other = A1**, you prefer **A0** (6 > 4).

3) The other player’s contract-adjusted incentives make **A0** (weakly) dominant for them, so the most likely outcome is they play **A0** with very high probability.

4) Best response to Other ≈ A0 is to play **A1** with probability 1.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P1
response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the potential outcomes of the game both with and without the contract.

### Without the Contract

Here are the possible payoffs without the contract:

- If both players choose A0:
  - You get 10 points.
  - The other player gets 10 points.
  
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get 0 points.
  - The other player gets 20 points.
  
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get 6 points.
  - The other player gets 2 points.
  
- If both players choose A1:
  - You get 4 points.
  - The other player gets 4 points.

### With the Contract

The contract adjusts payoffs as follows:

- If you choose A0:
  - You receive an additional 2 points from the other player.
  
- If you choose A1:
  - You pay an additional 2 points to the other player.

With the contract, the payoffs would be:

- If both players choose A0:
  - You get 10 + 2 = 12 points.
  - The other player gets 10 + 2 = 12 points.
  
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get 0 + 2 = 2 points.
  - The other player gets 20 - 2 = 18 points.
  
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get 6 - 2 = 4 points.
  - The other player gets 2 + 2 = 4 points.
  
- If both players choose A1:
  - You get 4 - 2 = 2 points.
  - The other player gets 4 - 2 = 2 points.

### Comparison of Outcomes

|         | You - No Contract | You - With Contract | Other - No Contract | Other - With Contract |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| A0, A0  | 10                  | 12                  | 10                   | 12                   |
| A0, A1  | 0                   | 2                   | 20                   | 18                   |
| A1, A0  | 6                   | 4                   | 2                    | 4                    |
| A1, A1  | 4                   | 2                   | 4                    | 2                    |

The table shows that the payouts are generally better for mutual cooperation (A0, A0) with or without the contract. However, the contract also reduces the benefit of defecting (choosing A1) significantly:

- If both players cooperate (A0, A0), you both get 12 points instead of 10.
- If one defects (one chooses A0, the other A1), the defector gets reduced rewards due to the payments.

The contract effectively raises the cost of defecting, encouraging cooperation.

### Decision

Given that the contract promotes higher and more balanced scores for both players when they choose A0, it appears advantageous to sign the contract.

### Final JSON Output:

```json
{"sign": true}
```

This decision involves reasoning that the overall tactic should be to aim for mutual cooperation, maximizing points for both players. The additional payments introduced by the contract act as a deterrent to choosing A1, making mutual A0 the most beneficial and realistic consistent outcome.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (my perspective as Player 1)

Without contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- +10 points if I choose A0 (paid by the other player)
- -10 points if the other player chooses A0 (I pay them)

My payoffs with contract:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 - 10 = **10**
- (A0, A1): 0 + 10 - 0 = **10**
- (A1, A0): 6 + 0 - 10 = **-4**
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = **4**

## Step 3: Analyze equilibrium WITHOUT contract

Checking pure strategy Nash equilibria without contract:
- (A0, A0): Not equilibrium - other player prefers A1 (gets 20 vs 10)
- (A0, A1): Not equilibrium - I prefer A1 (get 4 vs 0)
- (A1, A0): Not equilibrium - I prefer A0 (get 10 vs 6)
- (A1, A1): **Equilibrium** - Neither wants to deviate

**Without contract, I get 4 points at equilibrium.**

## Step 4: Analyze equilibrium WITH contract

With contract, checking my best response:
- If other plays A0: I get 10 (A0) vs -4 (A1) → Choose A0
- If other plays A1: I get 10 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → Choose A0

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy!**

Given I'll play A0, the other player gets 10 regardless of their choice (indifferent between A0 and A1).

**With contract, I get 10 points at equilibrium.**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- Without contract: 4 points
- With contract: 10 points

Since 10 > 4, signing the contract significantly benefits me.

## Step 6: Will the other player sign?

The other player also benefits:
- Without contract: 4 points (at (A1, A1) equilibrium)
- With contract: 10 points (at (A0, A0) or (A0, A1) equilibrium)

Both players benefit, so the contract should be signed.

response:
Let's break down the decision step-by-step:

1. **Review the basic game rules and payoffs:**
   - If both Player 1 and Player 2 choose A0: Player 1 gets 10, Player 2 gets 10.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 20.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 6, Player 2 gets 2.
   - If both Player 1 and Player 2 choose A1: Player 1 gets 4, Player 2 gets 4.

2. **Review the contract details:**
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 2 points, taken from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points, given to the other player.

3. **Analyze the effect of the contract on the payoffs:**

   With the contract:
   - If both Player 1 and Player 2 choose A0:
     - Player 1's payoff: 10 + 2 = 12.
     - Player 2's payoff: 10 (from the game) + 2 (from the contract) = 12.
   
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
     - Player 1's payoff: 0 + 2 = 2.
     - Player 2's payoff: 20 - 2 = 18.

   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
     - Player 1's payoff: 6 - 2 = 4.
     - Player 2's payoff: 2 + 2 = 4.

   - If both Player 1 and Player 2 choose A1:
     - Player 1's payoff: 4 - 2 = 2.
     - Player 2's payoff: 4 - 2 = 2.

4. **Compare payoffs with and without the contract:**

   Without the contract:
   - Both choose A0: (10, 10)
   - (A0, A1): (0, 20)
   - (A1, A0): (6, 2)
   - Both choose A1: (4, 4)

   With the contract:
   - Both choose A0: (12, 12)
   - (A0, A1): (2, 18)
   - (A1, A0): (4, 4)
   - Both choose A1: (2, 2)

5. **Strategy implications:**

   The contract makes the A0 choice more appealing because it enhances the cooperative outcome with higher payoffs (12 instead of 10). However, it reduces the benefit of defecting (A1) when the other player cooperates (A0) since the net gain is reduced (4 vs 6).

   - If both players cooperate (A0): The payoff is maximized to (12, 12).
   - Defecting (A1) in response to a cooperative (A0) opponent is less beneficial than before.
   - Both defecting (A1): Payoffs are reduced, making this less appealing (2, 2).

The contract seems to encourage both players to choose A0, leading to a better cooperative outcome.

6. **Decision:**

Given the contract encourages cooperation and maximizes the total points (12 each), it seems beneficial for both players to sign the contract.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{"sign": true}

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understanding the Original Game

Without the contract, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 10, Other gets 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0, Other gets 20
- (A1, A0): I get 6, Other gets 2
- (A1, A1): I get 4, Other gets 4

### Step 2: Finding the Nash Equilibrium Without Contract

Let me check each outcome:
- At (A0, A0): If other player deviates to A1, they get 20 instead of 10 → Not stable
- At (A0, A1): If I deviate to A1, I get 4 instead of 0 → Not stable
- At (A1, A0): If I deviate to A0, I get 10 instead of 6 → Not stable
- At (A1, A1): If I deviate to A0, I get 0 (worse). If other deviates to A0, they get 2 (worse) → **This is the Nash equilibrium**

**Without contract: Expected payoff = 4 points**

### Step 3: Understanding the Contract Effects

The contract modifies payoffs:
- Choosing A0: Receive +10 from other player
- Choosing A1: Pay -10 to other player

### Step 4: Calculating Modified Payoffs

With contract:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 - 10 = **10** for me, 10 + 10 - 10 = 10 for other
- (A0, A1): 0 + 10 + 10 = **20** for me, 20 - 10 - 10 = 0 for other
- (A1, A0): 6 - 10 - 10 = **-14** for me, 2 + 10 + 10 = 22 for other
- (A1, A1): 4 - 10 + 10 = **4** for me, 4 - 10 + 10 = 4 for other

### Step 5: Analyzing Strategy Dominance With Contract

For me:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives -14 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 20 vs A1 gives 4 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1 for me!**

For other player:
- If I play A0: A0 gives 10 vs A1 gives 0 → A0 is better
- If I play A1: A0 gives 22 vs A1 gives 4 → A0 is better

**A0 strictly dominates A1 for other player too!**

### Step 6: Nash Equilibrium With Contract

With the contract, (A0, A0) is the dominant strategy equilibrium.

**With contract: Expected payoff = 10 points**

### Step 7: Decision

- Without contract: 4 points
- With contract: 10 points

**10 > 4, so I should sign the contract!**

response:
The decision to sign the contract involves comparing the expected outcome without the contract to the expected outcome with the contract.

**1. Analysis of the Original Game (No Contract):**
As Player 2 (P2), we analyze the payoff matrix (P1, P2):
- (A0, A0): 10, 10
- (A0, A1): 0, 20
- (A1, A0): 6, 2
- (A1, A1): 4, 4

Player 2's best responses:
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 (20 > 10).
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1 (4 > 2).
P2 has a dominant strategy: **A1**.

Player 1's best responses:
- If P2 plays A0, P1 plays A0 (10 > 6).
- If P2 plays A1, P1 plays A1 (4 > 0).
Since P1 knows P2 will follow their dominant strategy (A1), P1 will also play A1.
**Nash Equilibrium (Original):** (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4).

**2. Analysis of the Game with the Contract:**
The contract adds +5 to any player choosing A0, taken from the other player.
Updated Payoff matrix (P1, P2):
- (A0, A0): (10+5-5, 10+5-5) = **10, 10**
- (A0, A1): (0+5-0, 20-5) = **5, 15**
- (A1, A0): (6-5, 2+5-0) = **1, 7** (Note: P1 loses 5, P2 gains 5)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

Player 1's best responses:
- If P2 plays A0, P1 plays A0 (10 > 1).
- If P2 plays A1, P1 plays A0 (5 > 4).
Now P1 has a dominant strategy: **A0**.

Player 2's best responses:
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 (15 > 10).
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 (7 > 4).
Since P2 knows P1 will follow their new dominant strategy (A0), P2 will play A1.
**Nash Equilibrium (Contract):** (A0, A1) with payoffs (5, 15).

**3. Comparison and Conclusion:**
- **P2’s payoff without contract:** 4 points.
- **P2’s payoff with contract:** 15 points.
- **P1’s payoff without contract:** 4 points.
- **P1’s payoff with contract:** 5 points.

Since both players receive higher payoffs under the contract's Nash Equilibrium (15 > 4 and 5 > 4), both players have a rational incentive to sign. Signing the contract significantly increases Player 2's potential points.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2 in this decision-making game, we need to consider both the actions and the potential payoffs associated with the choices made by both players. The objective is to maximize the points received by Player 2.

### Steps:

1. **Understand the Possible Payoffs:**
   - (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 10 points, Player 1 gets 10 points.
   - (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 20 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
   - (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 2 points, Player 1 gets 6 points.
   - (A1, A1): Player 2 gets 4 points, Player 1 gets 4 points.

2. **Evaluate Possible Strategies:**
   - If Player 1 is more likely to choose A0, Player 2 should choose A1 to maximize their own points (20 points vs. 10 points).
   - If Player 1 is more likely to choose A1, Player 2 must consider the trade-off between (2 points vs. 6 points) for A0, and (4 points vs. 4 points) for A1.

3. **Consider Mixed Strategies:**
   Instead of choosing a pure strategy (i.e., always A0 or always A1), Player 2 might adopt a mixed strategy where they assign probabilities to each action to maximize their expected payoff.

4. **Compute Expected Payoffs:**
   Let:
   - \( P(A0) \) be the probability Player 1 chooses A0.
   - \( P(A1) \) be the probability Player 1 chooses A1.

   Player 2's expected payoff for choosing A0:
   \[
   E2(A0) = 10P(A0) + 2P(A1)
   \]
   
   Player 2's expected payoff for choosing A1:
   \[
   E2(A1) = 20P(A0) + 4P(A1)
   \]

5. **Set Up Equations to Find Optimal Distribution:**
   To find the optimal strategy, equate the expected payoffs to find the balancing point:
   \[
   10P(A0) + 2P(A1) = 20P(A0) + 4P(A1)
   \]

Simplify:
   \[
   10P(A0) + 2(1-P(A0)) = 20P(A0) + 4(1-P(A0))
   \]
   \[
   10P(A0) + 2 - 2P(A0) = 20P(A0) + 4 - 4P(A0)
   \]
   \[
   8P(A0) + 2 = 16P(A0) + 4
   \]
   \[
   8P(A0) = 2
   \]
   \[
   P(A0) = 2/8 = 1/4
   \]
   
Thus, in the optimal mixed strategy, Player 1 should choose A0 with probability 1/4 and A1 with probability 3/4. Given this information about Player 1’s mixed strategy, Player 2 should aim to optimize their choice accordingly. 

### Final Decision:
Given the equalizing point, Player 2 can choose to equally split their probabilities to avoid any exploitation of pure strategies.

Therefore, an optimal strategy for Player 2 would be:
\[ \text{Select } P(A0) = 50\% \text{ and } P(A1) = 50\% \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}

First account for the contract transfers:

- If I choose **A0**: I get **+10** from the other player.
- If the other player chooses **A0**: I pay **10** to them.

So my **effective payoff** (base payoff + contract effects) becomes:

1. **(A0, A0)**: base 10 +10 (for my A0) −10 (because they played A0) = **10**
2. **(A1, A0)**: base 20 −10 (because they played A0) = **10**
3. **(A0, A1)**: base 2 +10 (for my A0) = **12**
4. **(A1, A1)**: base 4 = **4**

Now compare my actions against each possible opponent action:
- If they play **A0**: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 10 (tie)
- If they play **A1**: A0 gives 12, A1 gives 4 (A0 strictly better)

So **A0 weakly dominates A1**, and is strictly better in some cases. Best response is to play **A0 with probability 1**.

response:
Alright, let's break down the situation and analyze the payoffs to form an optimal strategy.

### Basic Analysis
First, let's consider the basic game payoff matrix without the contract:
- (A0, A0): You get 10 points.
- (A0, A1): You get 0 points.
- (A1, A0): You get 6 points.
- (A1, A1): You get 4 points.

Now, incorporate the contract:
- If you choose A0, you receive an additional +5 points and the other player loses -5 points.
- If you choose A1, no additional points are added or subtracted.

### Effective Payoff Matrix

Rewriting the payoffs:
- (A0, A0): You get \(10 + 5 = 15\) points. The other player gets \(10 - 5 = 5\) points.
- (A0, A1): You get \(0 + 5 = 5\) points. The other player gets \(20 - 5 = 15\) points.
- (A1, A0): You get 6 points. The other player gets 2 points.
- (A1, A1): You get 4 points. The other player gets 4 points.

### Effective payoff matrix with contract

|         | Other A0 | Other A1 |
|---------|----------|----------|
| You A0  |   15, 5  |  5, 15   |
| You A1  |    6, 2  |   4, 4   |

### Analysis
Your primary goal is to maximize your own points.

1. **Pure Strategies Analysis:**
   - Choosing A0 against the other player's A0 gets you 15 points.
   - Choosing A0 against the other player's A1 gets you 5 points.
   - Choosing A1 against the other player's A0 gets you 6 points.
   - Choosing A1 against the other player's A1 gets you 4 points.

2. **Expected Value:**
   To maximize expected value, consider the reasons the other player might choose A0 or A1. Without knowing their exact probabilities, let's assume they would want to maximize their own points as well, potentially leading to mixed strategies.

### Expected Utility Calculation

If we consider mixed strategies for simplicity and mutual benefit:

- Let's assume the probability \(q\) that the other player chooses A0.
- Let's assume the probability \(1 - q\) that the other player chooses A1.

Thus, your expected utility for choosing A0 (E[A0]) and A1 (E[A1]) respectively would be:
\[E[A0] = 15q + 5(1 - q) = 15q + 5 - 5q = 10q + 5\]
\[E[A1] = 6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4\]

To be indifferent (in equilibrium) between the two actions:
\[10q + 5 = 2q + 4\]
\[10q - 2q = 4 - 5\]
\[8q = -1\]

This results in \(q = -\frac{1}{8}\), invalid (probabilities must be from 0 to 1).

### Final Mixed Strategy:
As choosing pure A0 strictly dominates choosing A1, redistribution included:

Since the game dynamics push towards preferring A0 despite any mix, your optimal strategy should heavily lean towards A0.

**Final Recommended Distribution:**
```json
{
  "A0": 100,
  "A1": 0
}
```

Choosing A0 maximizes your expected points considering the additional contractual payoffs and the given payoffs structure.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (without contract)

From my perspective as Player 1:
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

### Step 2: Understand the contract terms

If the contract is signed:
- When a player plays A0, they receive 10 points from the other player
- When a player plays A1, no payment occurs

### Step 3: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

Let me recalculate all outcomes:

- **(A0, A0)**: Base 10 + 10 (I get for my A0) - 10 (I pay for their A0) = **10**
- **(A0, A1)**: Base 0 + 10 (I get for my A0) = **10**
- **(A1, A0)**: Base 6 - 10 (I pay for their A0) = **-4**
- **(A1, A1)**: Base 4 = **4**

### Step 4: Analyze strategic behavior WITHOUT contract

Player 2's best responses:
- If I play A0 → They prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If I play A1 → They prefer A1 (4 > 2)

Player 2 has a **dominant strategy: A1**

Given Player 2 plays A1, my best response is A1 (4 > 0).

**Nash Equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

### Step 5: Analyze strategic behavior WITH contract

My best responses with contract:
- If they play A0 → I prefer A0 (10 > -4)
- If they play A1 → I prefer A0 (10 > 4)

I have a **dominant strategy: A0**

Given I play A0, Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give them 10).

**Expected outcome with contract: I play A0 → I get 10 points (regardless of their choice)**

### Step 6: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: 4 points
- **With contract**: 10 points

### Conclusion

Signing the contract increases my expected payoff from 4 to 10 points. This is a significant improvement, so I should sign.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

**My payoff matrix (Player 1):**
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 6
- (A1, A1): I get 4

**Other player's payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): They get 10
- (A0, A1): They get 20
- (A1, A0): They get 2
- (A1, A1): They get 4

**Finding Nash Equilibrium without contract:**
- Player 2's best response: If I play A0 → they play A1 (20 > 10). If I play A1 → they play A1 (4 > 2). **A1 is dominant for Player 2.**
- Given Player 2 plays A1: I should play A1 (4 > 0)
- **Nash Equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds/subtracts 5 points when playing A0:
- If I play A0: I get +5, other pays -5
- If other plays A0: Other gets +5, I pay -5

**Modified payoffs for me:**
- (A0, A0): 10 + 5 - 5 = 10
- (A0, A1): 0 + 5 = 5
- (A1, A0): 6 - 5 = 1
- (A1, A1): 4

**Modified payoffs for other player:**
- (A0, A0): 10 + 5 - 5 = 10
- (A0, A1): 20 - 5 = 15
- (A1, A0): 2 + 5 = 7
- (A1, A1): 4

**Finding Nash Equilibrium with contract:**
- My best response: If they play A0 → I play A0 (10 > 1). If they play A1 → I play A0 (5 > 4). **A0 is dominant for me!**
- Given I play A0: They should play A1 (15 > 10)
- **Nash Equilibrium: (A0, A1) → I get 5 points**

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** Nash equilibrium gives me 4 points
- **With contract:** Nash equilibrium gives me 5 points

The contract improves my payoff from 4 to 5 points. Additionally:
- Player 2 also benefits greatly (15 vs 4), so they will likely sign
- The contract gives me a dominant strategy, simplifying my decision-making

**Conclusion:** I should sign the contract.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the actual payoffs with the contract

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +10 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments

Let me adjust the payoff matrix:

**Case 1: I play A0, Other plays A0**
- Base: (10, 10)
- I get +10 from other, Other gets +10 from me
- Final: (10 + 10 - 10, 10 + 10 - 10) = **(10, 10)**

**Case 2: I play A0, Other plays A1**
- Base: (0, 20)
- I get +10 from other
- Final: (0 + 10, 20 - 10) = **(10, 10)**

**Case 3: I play A1, Other plays A0**
- Base: (6, 2)
- Other gets +10 from me
- Final: (6 - 10, 2 + 10) = **(-4, 12)**

**Case 4: I play A1, Other plays A1**
- Base: (4, 4)
- No contract payments
- Final: **(4, 4)**

## Step 2: Analyze my optimal strategy

Modified payoff matrix (my payoff, other's payoff):

|        | Other A0 | Other A1 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **A0** | 10, 10   | 10, 10   |
| **A1** | -4, 12   | 4, 4     |

From my perspective:
- If other plays A0: I get **10** with A0 vs **-4** with A1 → A0 is better
- If other plays A1: I get **10** with A0 vs **4** with A1 → A0 is better

## Step 3: Conclusion

**A0 is a strictly dominant strategy** for me - it gives me a higher payoff regardless of what the other player does. I should play A0 with probability 100%.

The contract heavily incentivizes choosing A0, making it always optimal for me to choose A0.

Let me analyze this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs (as Player 2)

Without contract:
```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0         10              2
Player 2: A1         20              4
```

In the original game:
- A1 strictly dominates A0 for me (20 > 10 when P1 plays A0; 4 > 2 when P1 plays A1)
- Given I'll play A1, Player 1 prefers A1 (gets 4 vs 0)
- Nash equilibrium: Both play A1, I get **4 points**

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs with the contract

The contract modifies payoffs:
- Playing A0: +2 points (received from other player)
- Playing A1: -2 points (paid to other player)
- Other plays A0: -2 points (I pay them)
- Other plays A1: +2 points (they pay me)

With contract, my payoffs become:
```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0         10              6
Player 2: A1         16              4
```

Calculations:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 2 - 2 = 10
- (A1, A0): 20 - 2 - 2 = 16
- (A0, A1): 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
- (A1, A1): 4 - 2 + 2 = 4

## Step 3: Analyze the new game

With contract:
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (16 > 10)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A0 (6 > 4)

A1 no longer strictly dominates! The game changes fundamentally.

For Player 1 (calculating their payoffs with contract):
```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0         10              2
Player 2: A1          4              4
```

When I play A1, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give 4).

## Step 4: Find Nash equilibria with contract

There's a Nash equilibrium where:
- I play A1 (pure strategy)
- Player 1 mixes: plays A0 with probability 1/4, A1 with probability 3/4

My expected payoff: 1/4 × 16 + 3/4 × 4 = 4 + 3 = **7 points**

There's also a pure strategy equilibrium (A1, A0) where I get **16 points**.

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: I get 4 points
- **With contract**: I get at least 7 points (possibly 16)

The contract clearly benefits me.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

We are in a two-player game, with actions A0 and A1. You are Player 2.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) for each outcome:

1. (A0, A0): (10, 10)  
2. (A1, A0): (20, 0)  
3. (A0, A1): (2, 6)  
4. (A1, A1): (4, 4)

This is a classic asymmetric game.

Let’s analyze it from **your perspective as Player 2**.

We need to find the best response, and eventually look for a Nash equilibrium or optimal strategy.

But first, let's look at the **expected payoffs** for Player 2 depending on what Player 1 does.

But since both choose simultaneously, we’ll need to consider mixed strategies.

Let’s define:
- Let p = probability that Player 1 plays A0.
- Then (1-p) = probability Player 1 plays A1.

You choose a strategy q = probability you play A0.

Your expected payoff as Player 2:

- If you play A0:  
  Payoff = p * 10 + (1-p) * 2 = 10p + 2(1-p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2

- If you play A1:  
  Payoff = p * 0 + (1-p) * 4 = 0 + 4(1-p) = 4 - 4p

You’ll choose A0 if 8p + 2 > 4 - 4p  
=> 8p + 2 > 4 - 4p  
=> 12p > 2  
=> p > 1/6 ≈ 0.1667

So:
- If Player 1 plays A0 with p > 1/6, you prefer A0
- If p < 1/6, you prefer A1
- If p = 1/6, indifferent

Now consider Player 1’s incentives.

Player 1’s payoffs:

1. (A0, A0): 10
2. (A1, A0): 20
3. (A0, A1): 2
4. (A1, A1): 4

Let q = probability you (Player 2) play A0.

Player 1’s expected payoff:

- If Player 1 plays A0:  
  Payoff = q * 10 + (1-q) * 2 = 10q + 2(1-q) = 10q + 2 - 2q = 8q + 2

- If Player 1 plays A1:  
  Payoff = q * 20 + (1-q) * 4 = 20q + 4(1-q) = 20q + 4 - 4q = 16q + 4

Compare:  
8q + 2 vs 16q + 4

Set equal:  
8q + 2 = 16q + 4  
=> -8q = 2  
=> q = -0.25 → impossible

So 16q + 4 > 8q + 2 for all q ∈ [0,1]

So Player 1 **always prefers A1** regardless of q.

Because even when q = 0 (you always play A1), Player 1's payoff from A1 is 4; from A0 is 2 → still better.

Even when q = 1, A1 gives 20, A0 gives 10 → still better.

So **Player 1’s dominant strategy is A1**.

Thus, in the base game, Player 1 will choose A1 with probability 1.

Now, given that, what should **you (Player 2)** do?

If Player 1 plays A1:
- If you play A0: you get 2 points
- If you play A1: you get 4 points

So you prefer A1.

Thus, in the base game, the Nash equilibrium is:
- Player 1: A1 (dominant)
- Player 2: A1 (best response)

Both get 4 points.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the contract**

The proposed contract:
- If a player chooses A0 → receives +2 points, paid **equally from other players**
- If a player chooses A1 → pays -2 points, distributed **equally among other players**

You are Player 2. The contract is conditional: **only active if all players sign it**.

If the contract is signed, then the **payoffs are modified** by this additional payment structure.

Important: The contract affects **both** players. The payment is **drawn from other players**.

So, for example:
- If you play A0, you get +2 points.
- But this +2 is drawn equally from the other players.

There are only two players: you and Player 1.

So when you play A0, you get +2, and Player 1 loses 2.

Similarly, if you play A1, you lose 2, and Player 1 gains 2.

This is crucial.

Let’s formalize the **new payoff structure under contract**.

Let’s define the **total payoff** for each player for each outcome.

We must remember that both players are affected by the contract.

So for each outcome (action pair), we add the contract payments.

#### Case 1: (A0, A0)
- Player 1 plays A0: +2 (from contract)
- Player 2 plays A0: +2 (from contract)
- But both get this from the other → so effectively,
  - The +2 to each player comes from the other player.
  - Net effect: both players gain +2, but each pays -2 to the other → so **no net change** from contract?
  - Wait, the description says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players."

Since there is one other player, “drawn equally from the other players” means **all 2 points come from that one other player**.

So if you choose A0, you get +2, and the other player loses 2.

Similarly, if you choose A1, you pay 2, so the other player gains 2.

So:

- (A0, A0):  
  - Player 1: gets +2 (A0), Player 2: gets +2 (A0)  
  - So Player 1 gains 2 from contract, loses 2 to Player 2 (because Player 2 gets +2) → net: Player 1 gets +2 - 2 = 0 from contract?  
Wait, no.

Better to think of it as:

When a player chooses A0, they gain +2, and **that 2 is taken from the other player**.

So:
- If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 1 gets +2, Player 2 loses 2.
- If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 2 gets +2, Player 1 loses 2.

Similarly, if someone chooses A1, they pay 2, and the other player gains 2.

So now, **total payoff for each player = base payoff + contract adjustment**.

Let’s compute total payoff under contract for each cell.

---

### Contract-Adjusted Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2)

#### (A0, A0):
- Base: (10, 10)
- Contract: 
  - Player 1 plays A0: +2
  - Player 2 plays A0: +2
  - So Player 1 gets +2, but loses 2 to Player 2 → net contract: +2 - 2 = 0
  - Player 2 gets +2, but loses 2 to Player 1 → net: 0
- → Total: (10, 10)

Wait — that can’t be right. Let's clarify.

Actually, contract adjustments are **independent of base payoff**, and are **paid directly**.

But the contract says: “drawn equally from the other players”

So if both players play A0:
- Player 1 gets +2 from contract (because plays A0)
- Player 2 gets +2 from contract (because plays A0)
- But each must supply the 2 to the other, so:
  - Player 1 pays 2 to Player 2 (because Player 2 gets +2)
  - Player 2 pays 2 to Player 1 (because Player 1 gets +2)
- So net: **Player 1 gets +2 - 2 = 0 from contract**
- **Player 2 gets +2 - 2 = 0 from contract**
- So total: (10, 10) → unchanged.

#### (A1, A0):
- Base: Player 1: 20, Player 2: 0
- Contract:
  - Player 1 plays A1 → must pay 2 → so loses 2
  - Player 2 plays A0 → gains 2 → so gains 2
  - So Player 1 loses 2 to Player 2 → net contract: -2
  - Player 2 gains 2 from Player 1 → net contract: +2
- Total:
  - Player 1: 20 - 2 = 18
  - Player 2: 0 + 2 = 2

Wait — but Player 1 is paying 2, so he pays 2 to Player 2.

But Player 2 is receiving 2 — so yes.

Thus: (18, 2)

#### (A0, A1):
- Base: (2, 6)
- Contract:
  - Player 1 plays A0 → gets +2
  - Player 2 plays A1 → pays -2 → so loses 2
  - So Player 1 gets +2 (from contract), but must give it to Player 2? Wait no.

No: The payment is drawn from other players.

So:
- When Player 1 plays A0 → gains +2 → taken from other player → so Player 2 must pay 2 to Player 1
- When Player 2 plays A1 → must pay 2 → so gives 2 to Player 1

So:
- Player 2 pays 2 to Player 1 (because Player 1 gets +2 for A0)
- Player 2 pays 2 to Player 1 (because Player 2 plays A1 and must pay 2)
- Total Player 2 pays 4 to Player 1 → so Player 2 loses 4 from contract

- Player 1 gains 2 (for A0) and gains 2 (from A1 payment) → gains 4

But that can't be — that would mean the contract is redistributing 4 from Player 2 to Player 1.

Yes — it's the **sum of all contract effects**.

So yes:

In (A0, A1):
- Player 1: chooses A0 → gets +2 (source: Player 2)
- Player 2: chooses A1 → must pay 2 (to be paid to other players → so to Player 1)
- So Player 2 pays 2 to Player 1 (to finance the +2 to Player 1 for A0) AND pays another 2 to Player 1 (for their own A1 penalty)?
Wait — no.

Let’s re-read:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

"drawn equally from the other players" — if there is one other player, then the full 2 is drawn from that player.

> "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players."

So when you play A1, you pay 2, which is distributed to the other players.

So if there's only one other player, the 2 is given to that player.

So:

In (A0, A1):

- Player 1: plays A0 → gets +2 → paid by Player 2 → so Player 2 loses 2
- Player 2: plays A1 → pays 2 → given to Player 1 → so Player 1 gains 2

So:
- Player 1: gains 2 (from A0) + 2 (from Player 2’s A1 payment) = +4
- Player 2: loses 2 (for A0 bonus) + lose 2 (for A1 payment) → -4

Thus total contract: Player 1 +4, Player 2 -4

So total payoffs:
- Player 1: base 2 + 4 = 6
- Player 2: base 6 - 4 = 2

Wait — base is (2,6) → so yes.

But wait: Player 2 gets 6 from base, but loses 4 → total 2.

So (6, 2)

Wait, that’s inconsistent.

Let’s redo carefully.

- Base payoff: (2, 6) → (Player 1, Player 2)

- Contract effects:
  - Player 1 plays A0 → gets +2 → paid by Player 2 → Player 2 loses 2
  - Player 2 plays A1 → must pay 2 → distributed to other players (only Player 1) → so Player 1 gains 2

So:
- Player 1: +2 (A0) + 2 (from A1 payment) = +4
- Player 2: -2 (for A0) -2 (for A1) = -4

Net:
- Player 1: 2 (base) + 4 = 6
- Player 2: 6 (base) - 4 = 2

→ (6, 2)

But wait — Player 2 is getting +2 from base (A0,A1) → and loses 4 from contract → so net 2? Wait no: base is 6? No!

Base payoff in (A0, A1): (2, 6) → so Player 2 gets 6 from base.

Then contract: Player 2 loses 4 → so final: 6 - 4 = 2

Yes.

But Player 1: base 2, +4 from contract → 6

So (6, 2)

But that makes Player 1 better off.

Wait — is this correct? Let's double-check.

Yes: when Player 2 plays A1, they pay 2 → goes to Player 1.

When Player 1 plays A0, they get 2 → comes from Player 2.

So both happen. So Player 2 pays 4 to Player 1.

Player 1 gains 4.

So total: (2+4, 6-4) = (6, 2)

But this seems asymmetric in a strange way.

Let’s now do all four cases.

---

### **All Contract-Adjusted Payoffs**

Let’s define total payoff for (Player 1, Player 2)

#### (A0, A0)
- Base: (10, 10)
- Contract:
  - Player 1: gets +2 (A0), paid by Player 2 → Player 2 loses 2
  - Player 2: gets +2 (A0), paid by Player 1 → Player 1 loses 2
  - Net: each gives 2, gets 2 → net 0
- Final: (10, 10)

#### (A1, A0)
- Base: (20, 0)
- Contract:
  - Player 1 plays A1 → pays 2 → given to Player 2
  - Player 2 plays A0 → gets +2 → paid by Player 1
  - So:
    - Player 1: loses 2 (for A1) and loses 2 (for giving to Player 2) → total -4
    - Player 2: gains 2 (for A0) and gains 2 (for A1 payment) → total +4
- Final:
  - Player 1: 20 - 4 = 16
  - Player 2: 0 + 4 = 4

Wait — no: the A0 bonus for Player 2 is funded by Player 1. And A1 payment by Player 1 is distributed to Player 2.

So:
- Player 1 pays 2 for A1 → goes to Player 2
- Player 1 also pays 2 to fund Player 2’s A0 bonus → total 4 paid by Player 1
- Player 2 gains 2 from A0 and 2 from A1 → total +4

So yes: final payoffs:
- (20 - 4, 0 + 4) = (16, 4)

But is that right? The “paid by other players” is just the source.

So:
- Player 1 must pay 2 for playing A1 → goes to Player 2
- Player 1 must pay 2 for Player 2’s A0 bonus → goes to Player 2
- So Player 1 pays 4 total → Player 2 gains 4
- Final: (16, 4)

Yes.

#### (A0, A1)
- Base: (2, 6)
- Contract:
  - Player 1 plays A0 → gets +2 → paid by Player 2 → Player 2 loses 2
  - Player 2 plays A1 → pays 2 → distributed to Player 1 → Player 1 gains 2
- So:
  - Player 1: +2 (A0) + 2 (from A1) = +4
  - Player 2: -2 (A0) -2 (A1) = -4
- Final:
  - Player 1: 2 + 4 = 6
  - Player 2: 6 - 4 = 2
→ (6, 2)

#### (A1, A1)
- Base: (4, 4)
- Contract:
  - Player 1: plays A1 → pays 2 → goes to Player 2
  - Player 2: plays A1 → pays 2 → goes to Player 1
  - So:
    - Player 1: pays 2 (A1) → loses 2; gains 2 (from Player 2’s A1) → net 0
    - Player 2: pays 2 (A1) → loses 2; gains 2 (from Player 1’s A1) → net 0
- Final: (4, 4)

---

### Summary: Contract-Adjusted Payoffs

| (P1, P2) | Base | Contract-adjusted |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| (A0, A0) | (10,10) | (10,10) |
| (A1, A0) | (20,0) | (16,4) |
| (A0, A1) | (2,6)  | (6,2) |
| (A1, A1) | (4,4)  | (4,4) |

Now we analyze this new game with the contract in place.

You are **Player 2**.

You need to decide: **should you sign the contract**?

The contract only applies **if both players sign**.

So if you sign, and Player 1 signs, then the contract applies.

If you don’t sign, then it doesn’t apply — you play the base game.

We need to compare:
- Your expected payoff if you sign and Player 1 signs → then play the contract game
- Your expected payoff if you don’t sign → play the base game

But we don’t know whether Player 1 will sign. That’s part of the decision.

But the contract is approved by approval voting — so **Player 1 proposed it**, and we assume that if it passes, both must sign.

But **you are deciding whether to sign**.

The condition is: “the contract becomes active only if all players sign it.”

So if you don’t sign, contract does not activate — back to base game.

But if you sign, **and Player 1 signs**, then contract applies.

So the key is: **will Player 1 sign?**

Since Player 1 proposed it, it’s reasonable to assume Player 1 **will sign**, because they proposed it — and they likely think it benefits them.

Let’s check: in the contract, does Player 1 benefit?

In the base game, Player 1 gets 4 (in equilibrium).

Now let’s see what Player 1 would get under the contract.

We analyze the contract game.

#### Player 1’s incentives under contract

Let q = P(Player 2 plays A0)

Player 1’s payoffs:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - If P2 plays A0 → (10,10) → P1 gets 10
  - If P2 plays A1 → (6,2) → P1 gets 6
  - Expected: 10q + 6(1-q) = 10q + 6 - 6q = 4q + 6

- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - If P2 plays A0 → (16,4) → P1 gets 16
  - If P2 plays A1 → (4,4) → P1 gets 4
  - Expected: 16q + 4(1-q) = 16q + 4 - 4q = 12q + 4

Compare:
- A0: 4q + 6
- A1: 12q + 4

Set equal: 4q + 6 = 12q + 4 → 2 = 8q → q = 0.25

So:
- If q < 0.25, A1 better
- If q > 0.25, A0 better
- If q = 0.25, indifferent

Now, what is Player 2’s best response?

#### Player 2’s incentives under contract

Player 2’s payoffs:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - P1 plays A0 → (10,10) → P2 gets 10
  - P1 plays A1 → (16,4) → P2 gets 4
  - Expected: 10p + 4(1-p) = 6p + 4, where p = P(P1 plays A0)

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - P1 plays A0 → (6,2) → P2 gets 2
  - P1 plays A1 → (4,4) → P2 gets 4
  - Expected: 2p + 4(1-p) = 2p + 4 - 4p = -2p + 4

Set equal: 6p + 4 = -2p + 4 → 8p = 0 → p = 0

So:
- If p < 0, not possible → so for all p > 0, 6p + 4 > -2p + 4
- So at p=0, indifferent
- For p>0, A0 better

So Player 2 **never wants to play A1** if p > 0

But p = P(Player 1 plays A0)

So if Player 1 plays A0 with positive probability, Player 2 prefers A0.

But at p=0, indifferent.

Now, back to Player 1.

Player 1’s incentive depends on q = P(Player 2 plays A0)

Player 2 wants to play A0 whenever p > 0

So if Player 1 plays A0 with positive probability, Player 2 will play A0

So if Player 1 plays A0 with p > 0, then q → 1 (if Player 2 best responds)

But then Player 1: if q=1, then:
- A0: 4(1) + 6 = 10
- A1: 12(1) + 4 = 16 → better

So Player 1 prefers A1

Contradiction: if Player 1 plays A1 (p=0), then Player 2 is indifferent → might play A1 or A0.

At p=0:
- Player 2’s expected:
  - A0: 6(0) + 4 = 4
  - A1: -2(0) + 4 = 4 → indifferent

So Player 2 can play any mix.

Suppose Player 1 plays A1 with p=0 → so Player 2 can choose.

But if Player 2 plays A0 → q=1 → then Player 1’s payoff: A0: 4(1)+6=10, A1: 12(1)+4=16 → still prefers A1 → so p=0 is still best

If Player 2 plays A1 → q=0 → then Player 1:
- A0: 4(0)+6=6
- A1: 12(0)+4=4 → so A0 better → so player 1 would play A0

But then Player 2 would get 10 if playing A0 → so they’d prefer A0

So if Player 1 plays A0 → Player 2 best responds with A0 → then Player 1 gets 10 from A0, 4 from A1 → prefers A0

But if Player 2 plays A0 → Player 1 plays A0 → so p=1 → q=1 → Player 1 gets 10

But earlier when q=1, Player 1 prefers A1 (16 > 10)

Wait — this is inconsistent.

Let’s look more carefully.

Suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability q.

Player 1: best response.

We saw that Player 1 prefers A1 if q > 0.25, A0 if q < 0.25

Player 2: best response is A0 if p > 0

So let’s find Nash equilibrium.

Assume a mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let p = P(Player 1 plays A0)

Let q = P(Player 2 plays A0)

In equilibrium:
- Player 1 indifferent only if q = 0.25
- Player 2 indifferent only if p = 0

But if p=0, Player 2 indifferent → so q can be anything, but if q > 0.25, Player 1 prefers A1 → p=0 → consistent.

But if q=0.25, Player 1 indifferent.

Then Player 1 can play any mix.

But Player 2 wants p > 0 → so if p=0, Player 2 is indifferent but may play A0.

But if Player 2 plays A0 with q > 0, then Player 1 prefers A1 if q > 0.25

So only possible equilibrium is:
- Player 1 plays A1 with probability 1
- Player 2 plays A1 with probability 1

Why?

Because if Player 1 plays A1 (p=0), Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give 4)
But if Player 2 plays A0 with q>0, Player 1 gets:
- A0: 4q + 6
- A1: 12q + 4

At q=1: A0: 10, A1: 16 → prefers A1
At q=0: A0: 6, A1: 4 → prefers A0

So if q > 0.25, Player 1 prefers A1
Only if q ≤ 0.25, Player 1 might play A0

But Player 2: if p=0, Player 2 gets 4 for A0, 4 for A1 → indifferent

So Player 2 can play A1 with q=1.

Then q=1 > 0.25 → Player 1 prefers A1

So p=1 → but we assumed p=0 → contradiction.

Alternatively, if q < 0.25, Player 1 prefers A0, so p=1

But at p=1, Player 2: A0 gives 10, A1 gives 2 → so prefers A0, q=1

But q=1 > 0.25 → so Player 1 prefers A1 → contradiction.

Only consistent point is when Player 1 plays A1, and Player 2 plays A1

Then:
- Player 1 gets 4 from A1
- Player 2 gets 4 from A1
- Check Player 1’s incentive: if p=0, q=1 → A1 gives 16(1)+4=20? Wait no

Wait: when Player 1 plays A1, and Player 2 plays A0: (16,4)
But if Player 2 is playing A1, then (A1,A1): (4,4)

So if Player 1 plays A1, and Player 2 plays A1 → (4,4)

Player 1’s expected payoff from A1 given q=1 (Player 2 always A1): when P2 plays A1, (A1,A1) → 4
If P2 plays A0, (A1,A0) → 16

So if Player 2 plays A1 with q=1, then Player 1’s payoff from A1: 4
From A0: 10 (if P2 A0) but P2 never does → so if P2 plays A1, A0 gives 6

So A1: 4, A0: 6 → so Player 1 prefers A0

So cannot have P2 playing A1 if P1 plays A1

Eventually, we see: the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium in the contract game is:

**(A1, A0)** → but Player 1 wants A0, Player 2 wants A0 only if p>0

It’s complicated.

Let’s just check the pure strategy profiles:

- (A0, A0): (10,10) → but Player 1 can deviate to A1: if P2 plays A0, A1 gives 16 > 10 → so not equilibrium
- (A0, A1): (6,2) → Player 1: A0 gives 6, A1 gives 4 → so would deviate
- (A1, A0): (16,4) → Player 1: if P2 plays A0, A1 gives 16, A0 gives 10 → so prefers A1 → good
  - Player 2: if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 4 from A0, 4 from A1 → indifferent
  - so can play A0
  - so (A1, A0) is Nash equilibrium: each best responds
- (A1, A1): (4,4) → Player 1: if P2 plays A1, A1 gives 4, A0 gives 6 → prefers A0 → deviation profitable

So only pure strategy NE is (A1, A0) with payoffs (16, 4) for (P1, P2)

And in this case, Player 2 gets 4 points.

Now, in the base game, as we saw, equilibrium is (A1, A1) with (4,4)

So under contract, if it applies, you get 4 points.

In base game, if you don't sign, you also get 4 points (in equilibrium).

But wait — in base game, you both play A1 → you get 4.

Under contract, you get 4 if you play A0 and the other plays A1.

But in the contract game, the equilibrium is (A1, A0), so you play A0, get 4.

So same payoff.

But is it stable?

Earlier we saw that if you play A0, and Player 1 plays A1 (which they do in equilibrium), you get 4 from contract game.

In base game, if both play A1, you get 4.

So same.

But now, can you do better?

Suppose in the contract game, if you play A0, and Player 1 plays A1, you get 4.

But if you play A1, you get 4.

So you are indifferent.

But in the base game, if you play A0, you get 2; if you play A1, you get 4 — so you prefer A1.

So in both games, you get 4.

But in the contract game, if you were to play A0 while Player 1 plays A1, you get 4, same as A1.

So no incentive to deviate.

But in base game, you get 4.

So same.

But is there a better outcome?

In base game, the only equilibrium is (A1,A1) → (4,4)

Under contract, the pure NE is (A1, A0) → (16,4) for P1,P2.

You get 4.

Same.

But the contract makes Player 1 get more, but you get the same.

Now, should you sign?

If you sign, and assume Player 1 signs, then contract applies → you get 4

If you don’t sign, you play base game → you get 4

So same.

But is there a risk?

What if your signing causes Player 1 to change strategy?

In base game, Player 1 wants A1 anyway.

In contract game, Player 1 wants A1 if q > 0.25.

Since q=1 (you play A1), then yes.

But under contract, you can play A0 and get same payoff.

But if you sign the contract, and you play A0, you get 4, but in base game you get 4.

But the contract might allow you to *earn more* in some scenarios.

But in the equilibrium, you get 4 in both.

Moreover, in the contract game, there is a risk: if you both play A0, you get 10.

But that’s not equilibrium.

So you’re not likely to get there.

So expected payoff is 4 in both cases.

But is it possible the contract gives you *better* opportunities?

Let’s compare expected payoff.

But in both cases, the equilibrium payoff is 4 for you.

So no difference.

But consider this: in the base game, you have a dominant strategy to play A1, get 4.

Under contract, if you play A1, and Player 1 plays A1, you get 4.

If you play A0, you get 4.

So you are indifferent.

But if you sign, you might be more likely to get 4.

But no gain.

However, there’s a small issue: in the contract game, if you were to play A0 while Player 1 plays A1, you get 4 — same as base.

But in base game, if you play A0 and Player 1 plays A1, you get 6.

In base game: (A0,A1) → (2,6)

You get 6.

But in contract game, (A0,A1) → (6,2) → you get 2.

Oh! Big difference.

In the contract game, if you play A0 and Player 1 plays A1, you get only 2.

In base game, you get 6.

So if you play A0, in contract game you get less.

But in equilibrium, you are not playing A0 if you can avoid it.

But in the contract game, equilibrium is (A1,A0), so Player 1 plays A1, you play A0 → you get 4.

In base game, you play A1, get 4.

But if you were to play A0 in base game, you would get 6 — but you don’t because it’s not optimal.

So in equilibrium, you get 4 in both.

But the contract makes you worse off in off-equilibrium actions.

But since you play optimally, it’s the same.

However, you have no incentive to sign, because you get the same payoff.

But there's another angle: if you sign, you are tied to the contract.

But if you don't sign, you can play the base game.

And in both cases, you get 4.

So no loss, no gain.

But is there a risk?

Suppose Player 1 doesn't sign.

Then contract doesn't apply.

You play base game.

You get 4.

If you sign, and Player 1 signs, you get 4.

So same.

But if you sign, and Player 1 does not sign, then contract doesn't apply — you play base game — get 4.

So either way, you get 4.

Therefore, you are indifferent.

But you might as well not sign to keep options or avoid risk.

But there is a risk: if you sign, and you are not in equilibrium, you might get less.

But in any case, expected payoff is 4.

So you are indifferent.

But the contract has no benefit for you.

In fact, in some cases, it hurts you — if you play A0 and Player 1 plays A1, you go from 6 to 2.

So it makes you worse off in some scenarios.

But since you won't play A0 in base game, and under contract you might play it only if you are better off, but in this case, you are not.

Ultimately, since the expected payoff is the same, and you have no gain, and there is potential for loss in off-equilibrium play, you should **not** sign if you are risk-averse.

But the question is to maximize expected points.

And in both cases, it's 4.

But there’s a mistake: in the contract game, the equilibrium is (A1,A0), but is it stable?

Player 1: if Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 16 from A1, 10 from A0 → prefers A1

Player 2: if Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 gets 4 from A0, 4 from A1 → indifferent.

So yes, (A1,A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

You get 4.

In base game, (A1,A1) is equilibrium, you get 4.

So same.

But is there a mixed strategy equilibrium with higher payoff?

For example, if you play A1 with some probability, you might get more.

But in both games, the dominant strategy for you is A1 in base.

Under contract, it’s not dominant, but you are indifferent.

But in practice, you get 4.

So no gain.

Therefore, signing the contract gives you no benefit, and may expose you to lower payoffs in some cases.

So the rational choice is to **not sign**.

Final decision.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 3 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 13 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game (no contract)

Base payoffs from my perspective (Player 1):
```
              Other plays A0    Other plays A1
I play A0:         10                0
I play A1:          6                4
```

From the other player's perspective:
- If I play A0: They get 10 for A0, or 20 for A1 → They prefer A1
- If I play A1: They get 2 for A0, or 4 for A1 → They prefer A1

**A1 is dominant for the other player.** Given they play A1, I prefer A1 (4 > 0).

**Nash equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

Modified payoffs with C1:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 - 10 = 10 for me
- (A0, A1): 0 + 10 - 0 = 10 for me  
- (A1, A0): 6 + 0 - 10 = -4 for me
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4 for me

```
              Other plays A0    Other plays A1
I play A0:         10               10
I play A1:         -4                4
```

**A0 is now dominant for me** (10 > -4 and 10 > 4).

Given I play A0, the other player gets 10 for either action (indifferent).

**Nash equilibrium with C1: (A0, A0) or (A0, A1) → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

Modified payoffs with C2:
- (A0, A0): 10 + 3 - 3 = 10 for me
- (A0, A1): 0 + 3 + 13 = 16 for me
- (A1, A0): 6 - 13 - 3 = -10 for me
- (A1, A1): 4 - 13 + 13 = 4 for me

```
              Other plays A0    Other plays A1
I play A0:         10               16
I play A1:        -10                4
```

**A0 is dominant for me** (10 > -10 and 16 > 4).

Given I play A0, the other player gets 10 for A0 or 4 for A1, so they prefer A0.

**Nash equilibrium with C2: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Decision

Comparison:
- No contract: 4 points
- Contract 1: 10 points
- Contract 2: 10 points

Both contracts significantly improve my payoff from 4 to 10 points. Since both yield the same equilibrium payoff for me, I should approve both to maximize the likelihood that *some* beneficial contract is implemented.

response:
To decide the best distribution of actions A0 and A1, we need to consider the total expected payoffs, taking into account the payments specified in the contract.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Analyze the Payoffs without the Contract:**
   1.1 If both choose A0:
   - Player 1 gets 10 points.
   - Player 2 gets 10 points.
   
   1.2 If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
   - Player 1 gets 0 points.
   - Player 2 gets 20 points.
   
   1.3 If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
   - Player 1 gets 6 points.
   - Player 2 gets 2 points.
   
   1.4 If both choose A1:
   - Player 1 gets 4 points.
   - Player 2 gets 4 points.

2. **Incorporate the Contract Effect:**
   2.1 If Player 1 chooses A0:
   - Player 1 gets an additional 2 points.
   - Player 2 loses 2 points.
   
   2.2 If Player 1 chooses A1:
   - Player 1 loses 2 points.
   - Player 2 gains 2 points.

3. **Adjusted Payoffs Considering the Contract:**
   3.1 Player 1 chooses A0:
   - If Player 2 chooses A0:
     - Player 1: 10 + 2 = 12
     - Player 2: 10 - 2 = 8
   - If Player 2 chooses A1:
     - Player 1: 0 + 2 = 2
     - Player 2: 20 - 2 = 18
   
   3.2 Player 1 chooses A1:
   - If Player 2 chooses A0:
     - Player 1: 6 - 2 = 4
     - Player 2: 2 + 2 = 4
   - If Player 2 chooses A1:
     - Player 1: 4 - 2 = 2
     - Player 2: 4 + 2 = 6

Thus, the payoff matrix for Player 1 becomes:
- A0 vs A0: 12
- A0 vs A1: 2
- A1 vs A0: 4
- A1 vs A1: 2

### Strategy Considerations:
1. **Nash Equilibrium Concept:**
   - By examining the adjusted payoffs, I look for strategies where neither player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate.
   - Note that the other player would also rationally analyze payoffs and consider similar calculations.
   
2. **Mixed Strategies:**
   - With the given payoffs, both pure strategies (always choosing a single action) and mixed strategies (choosing a probabilistic mix of actions) need to be evaluated.
   
Given the payoffs:
- **A0 is dominant for Player 1** since the payoff is higher (12 points) when both players choose A0 compared to any other situation.

### Conclusion:
For Player 1, choosing A0 with a higher probability seems optimal since it generally leads to higher payoffs both in pure and mixed strategies.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P1
response:
To tackle the problem of determining the optimal probability distribution for the actions A0 and A1, we need to consider several factors:

1. **The Payoff Matrix:**
   - You choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
   - You choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
   - You choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
   - You choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.

2. **The Rejected Payment Contract:**
   - This contract is irrelevant since it was rejected by Player 2.

### Analysis:

First, let's analyze the pure strategies:
- If both players choose A0:
  - Payoff: 10 for Player 1, 10 for Player 2.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Payoff: 0 for Player 1, 20 for Player 2.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Payoff: 6 for Player 1, 2 for Player 2.
- If both players choose A1:
  - Payoff: 4 for Player 1, 4 for Player 2.

### Dominant Strategies:
No dominant strategy exists for either player, but we can analyze the expected utility:

#### Mixed Strategy (Probabilistic):
Let's denote the probability of choosing A0 as \( p \) and choosing A1 as \( 1 - p \). Since this is a simultaneous game, assume the opponent uses similar probabilities \( q \) and \( 1 - q \).

Expected payoff for Player 1:
\[ \text{E}(U_1) = p*q*10 + p*(1-q)*0 + (1-p)*q*6 + (1-p)*(1-q)*4 \]

Expected payoff for Player 2:
\[ \text{E}(U_2) = p*q*10 + p*(1-q)*20 + (1-p)*q*2 + (1-p)*(1-q)*4 \]

Maximizing Player 1's expected utility involves finding the best \( p \)-value considering \( q \). Given potential symmetry and lack of dominant strategy, an equal mix might balance the payoffs. This suggests giving A0 and A1 equal probabilities could be an equilibrium.

### Nash Equilibrium:
Given both players would prefer avoiding the payout asymmetry and given both want to maximize their expected payoffs, a probable Nash Equilibrium occurs when both players mix actions equally.

Thus, let's assign:
- Probability for A0 = 50%
- Probability for A1 = 50%

### Conclusion:
Given the balance in the payoff matrix and the simultaneous decision-making aspect, evenly distributed probabilities are the optimal strategy.

Here's the JSON object:

```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

This equal probability distribution over both actions maximizes the expected points while maintaining a strategic balance with the opponent.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for this game, we need to consider both the payoff matrix and the added contract's impact on the points.

First, let's outline the payoff matrix considering its effect without the contract:
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: I get 10, the other player gets 10.
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: I get 0, the other player gets 20.
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: I get 6, the other player gets 2.
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: I get 4, the other player gets 4.

Now, let's incorporate the contract into the payoff:
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: I get 12 (since I get 2 extra points from the contract), the other player gets 12.
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: I get 2 (0 + 2 from the contract), the other player gets 18 (20 - 2 for the contract).
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: I get 4 (6 - 2 for the contract), the other player gets 4 (2 + 2 for the contract).
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: I get 2 (4 - 2 for the contract), the other player gets 2 (4 - 2 for the contract).

Thus, the updated payoff matrix considering the contract is:
- (A0, A0) = (12, 12)
- (A0, A1) = (2, 18)
- (A1, A0) = (4, 4)
- (A1, A1) = (2, 2)

Next, we need to determine the best strategy probabilistically. To simplify, let's denote the probability by which I choose A0 as \(p\) and the probability by which the other player chooses A0 as \(q\).

Given this adaptation, the expected payoff when I choose A0, given the other player's strategy:
\[ E(A0) = 12q + 2(1-q) = 12q + 2 - 2q = 10q + 2 \]

The expected payoff when I choose A1, given the other player's strategy:
\[ E(A1) = 4q + 2(1-q) = 4q + 2 - 2q = 2q + 2 \]

We can see what the other player would think similarly:
\[ E'(A0) = 12p + 4(1-p) = 12p + 4 - 4p = 8p + 4 \]
\[ E'(A1) = 18(1-p) = 18 - 18p \]

Maximizing my expected payoff sinks to choosing \(p\) to maximize:
\[ 10q + 2 \geq 2q + 2 \rightarrow 8q \geq 0 \rightarrow q \geq 0 \]
(Since non-negative, true)

And theirs to minimize my \(p\):
\[ 18 - 10p \leq 4 + 10p \rightarrow 2p \geq 18/14 \approx 1.285 \]

It is clear dominant strategy balances around mutual choice traction changing contract burden.

Thus, we need to simulate multiple rounds or belief adherence to rational utility maximizing subjecting, as complexity or lack guarantees nosing bias pressures.

Final assumption hints aligning high mixed Nash payments. Essentially, we balance a decoy randomized or fixed close to equal typical variance around:

Due diligence averts round perturbations potentially fit following simplifying:

**Final JSON Combination Distribution**:
```json
{
    "A0": 60,
    "A1": 40
}
```

This distribution balances payout margins robust gain variabilities leveraging approximation tack.

To maximize the total points received as Player 2, let's analyze the game step by step, incorporating the effects of the payment contract.

### 1. Identify Original Payoffs (P1, P2)
*   **(A0, A0):** (10, 10)
*   **(A0, A1):** If P2 chooses A1 and P1 chooses A0, P2 gets 20 and P1 gets 0. (0, 20)
*   **(A1, A0):** If P2 chooses A0 and P1 chooses A1, P2 gets 2 and P1 gets 6. (6, 2)
*   **(A1, A1):** (4, 4)

### 2. Apply the Payment Contract
The contract specifies that any player choosing A0 receives 5 points from the other player.
*   **(P1=A0, P2=A0):** Both get +5 and -5. Net change is 0.
    *   Final: **(10, 10)**
*   **(P1=A0, P2=A1):** P1 gets +5, P2 gets -5.
    *   Final: 0 + 5 = 5 (P1), 20 - 5 = 15 (P2) $\rightarrow$ **(5, 15)**
*   **(P1=A1, P2=A0):** P2 gets +5, P1 gets -5.
    *   Final: 6 - 5 = 1 (P1), 2 + 5 = 7 (P2) $\rightarrow$ **(1, 7)**
*   **(P1=A1, P2=A1):** No additional payments.
    *   Final: **(4, 4)**

### 3. Analyze the Strategies (Nash Equilibrium)
*   **Player 1 (Rows):**
    *   If P2 chooses A0, P1 gets 10 (A0) or 1 (A1). A0 is better.
    *   If P2 chooses A1, P1 gets 5 (A0) or 4 (A1). A0 is better.
    *   Conclusion: **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1.**

*   **Player 2 (Columns):**
    *   If P1 chooses A0 (their dominant strategy), P2's options are 10 (A0) or 15 (A1).
    *   Conclusion: **A1 is the best response** to Player 1's expected move.

### 4. Conclusion
In this game, Player 2's proposed contract successfully induced Player 1 to play A0 as a dominant strategy. Knowing Player 1 will rationally play A0 to maximize their own points (getting at least 5 points compared to a maximum of 4 points otherwise), Player 2 achieves the highest individual payoff (15 points) by playing A1. Even if the game is played over multiple rounds, Player 1 has no rational incentive to deviate from A0, as A1 results in lower payoffs for them regardless of Player 2's actions.

Thus, the optimal strategy for Player 2 is to play A1 with 100% probability.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, let's analyze the game by first incorporating the contract's payments into the base payoffs.

**1. Re-calculate the Payoff Matrix:**

*   **Both choose A0:**
    *   Player 1: 10 (base) + 5 (for A0) - 5 (Player 2 chose A0) = 10
    *   Player 2: 10 (base) + 5 (for A0) - 5 (Player 1 chose A0) = 10
*   **Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:**
    *   Player 1: 20 (base) + 0 (for A1) - 5 (Player 2 chose A0) = 15
    *   Player 2: 0 (base) + 5 (for A0) - 0 (Player 1 chose A1) = 5
*   **Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:**
    *   Player 1: 2 (base) + 5 (for A0) - 0 (Player 2 chose A1) = 7
    *   Player 2: 6 (base) + 0 (for A1) - 5 (Player 1 chose A0) = 1
*   **Both choose A1:**
    *   Player 1: 4 (base) + 0 (for A1) - 0 (Player 2 chose A1) = 4
    *   Player 2: 4 (base) + 0 (for A1) - 0 (Player 1 chose A1) = 4

**Final Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
| | Player 2 (A0) | Player 2 (A1) |
|---|---|---|
| **Player 1 (A0)** | (10, 10) | (7, 1) |
| **Player 1 (A1)** | (15, 5) | (4, 4) |

**2. Analyze Dominant Strategies for Player 2:**
*   If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets **10** from A0, **1** from A1. (A0 preferred)
*   If Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets **5** from A0, **4** from A1. (A0 preferred)
Since choosing A0 yields a higher payoff regardless of Player 1's choice, **A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 2**.

**3. Analyze Player 1's Response:**
*   Knowing Player 2 is rational and will choose A0, Player 1 compares their own payoffs for when Player 2 plays A0:
    *   Player 1 gets 10 from A0 vs **15** from A1.
*   Player 1 will therefore choose A1 to maximize their payoff.

**4. Conclusion:**
The Nash Equilibrium of this game is (Player 1: A1, Player 2: A0). In this scenario, Player 2 receives 5 points. Since A0 is a dominant strategy for Player 2, deviating to A1 would only result in a lower payoff (1 point if Player 1 plays A0, or 4 points if Player 1 plays A1). Therefore, playing A0 with 100% probability is the most rational decision to maximize total points.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Identify the Payoff Matrix

Since the contract was rejected, I'm playing the original game. From my perspective as Player 1:

|           | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0 | 10             | 0              |
| I play A1 | 6              | 4              |

From Player 2's perspective:

|           | I play A0 | I play A1 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| They play A0 | 10     | 2         |
| They play A1 | 20     | 4         |

## Step 2: Analyze Player 2's Strategy

Let me check if Player 2 has a dominant strategy:
- If I play A0: Player 2 gets 10 for A0 vs **20 for A1** → A1 is better (+10)
- If I play A1: Player 2 gets 2 for A0 vs **4 for A1** → A1 is better (+2)

**Player 2 has A1 as a strictly dominant strategy** - they should always play A1 regardless of what I do.

## Step 3: Determine My Best Response

Given that a rational Player 2 will play A1:
- If I play A0: I get 0 points
- If I play A1: I get 4 points

**My best response to A1 is to play A1.**

## Step 4: Verify the Nash Equilibrium

The Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) with payoffs (4, 4). Neither player can improve by unilaterally deviating:
- If I deviate to A0, I get 0 < 4
- If Player 2 deviates to A0, they get 2 < 4

## Conclusion

Since Player 2 has a dominant strategy of A1, and my best response is also A1, the rational play is to choose A1 with certainty.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate modified payoffs with the contract

The base payoffs are given, but I need to add the contract effects:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +10 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payments

Let me calculate my payoffs for each scenario:

**Scenario (My A0, Other A0):**
- Base: 10 points
- I receive +10 for choosing A0
- I pay -10 for other choosing A0
- **Total: 10 points**

**Scenario (My A0, Other A1):**
- Base: 0 points
- I receive +10 for choosing A0
- Other pays nothing (chose A1)
- **Total: 10 points**

**Scenario (My A1, Other A0):**
- Base: 6 points
- I receive nothing (chose A1)
- I pay -10 for other choosing A0
- **Total: -4 points**

**Scenario (My A1, Other A1):**
- Base: 4 points
- No contract payments
- **Total: 4 points**

## Step 2: Construct my payoff matrix

```
                Other plays A0    Other plays A1
I play A0:           10                10
I play A1:           -4                 4
```

## Step 3: Identify optimal strategy

Comparing my options:
- **If other plays A0:** A0 gives me 10, A1 gives me -4 → A0 is better
- **If other plays A1:** A0 gives me 10, A1 gives me 4 → A0 is better

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - it gives me a higher payoff regardless of what the other player does.

## Step 4: Determine probability distribution

Since A0 is strictly dominant, my optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Calculate Modified Payoffs with Contract

Let me first determine the actual payoffs after considering the contract.

**Base payoffs (Me, Other):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)  
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Contract effect:** If a player chooses A0, they get +5 points from the other player.

**Modified payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): I get 10+5-5=10, Other gets 10+5-5=10
  - Both choose A0, so both receive +5 and both pay -5
- (A0, A1): I get 0+5=5, Other gets 20-5=15
  - I choose A0 (+5 from other), Other chooses A1 (pays -5)
- (A1, A0): I get 6-5=1, Other gets 2+5=7
  - I choose A1 (pays -5), Other chooses A0 (+5 from me)
- (A1, A1): I get 4, Other gets 4
  - No additional payments

## Step 2: Construct My Payoff Matrix

```
                Other plays A0    Other plays A1
I play A0:           10                 5
I play A1:            1                 4
```

## Step 3: Check for Dominant Strategy

Comparing my payoffs:
- If other plays A0: I get 10 from A0 vs 1 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: I get 5 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - regardless of what the other player does, I always get more points by choosing A0.

## Step 4: Verify Nash Equilibrium

Since A0 is my dominant strategy, I should play A0 with probability 1.

If I play A0 with certainty, the other player will choose between:
- A0: gets 10 points
- A1: gets 15 points

So the other player would choose A1, leading to the Nash equilibrium (A0, A1) where I get 5 points.

## Step 5: Optimal Strategy

Since A0 is a dominant strategy that maximizes my expected payoff regardless of the other player's choice, I should play A0 with 100% probability.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understand the Basic Game Rules and Payoff Description**:
   - Without any contract, choosing actions based solely on the payoff matrix:
     - If both choose A0: You get 10 points, your opponent gets 10 points.
     - If you choose A1 and opponent chooses A0: You get 20 points, your opponent gets 0 points.
     - If you choose A0 and opponent chooses A1: You get 2 points, your opponent gets 6 points.
     - If both choose A1: You get 4 points, your opponent gets 4 points.

2. **Understand the Payment Contract Proposed by Player 1 (Contract C1)**:
   - If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other players.
   - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.
   - Net impact on scores when both players choose specific actions:
     - Both choose A0: Adjusted to 9 points each.
     - You A1, opponent A0: Adjusted to 20 points for you, -1 points for opponent.
     - You A0, opponent A1: Adjusted to 1 point for you, 7 points for opponent.
     - Both choose A1: No change, remains 4 points each.

3. **Understand the Payment Contract Proposed by Player 2 (Your Proposal, Contract C2)**:
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 points, distributed equally among the other players.
   - Net impact on scores when both players choose specific actions:
     - Both choose A0: Adjusted to 20 points each.
     - You A1, opponent A0: Adjusted to 10 points for you, -10 points for opponent.
     - You A0, opponent A1: Adjusted to 12 points for you, 16 points for opponent.
     - Both choose A1: Adjusted to -6 points each.

### Making Decisions on Contracts

For **Contract C1** (Proposed by the other player):
- Leads to slight decrease in your score when both choose A0.
- Increases opponent payoff significantly if they choose A1 while you choose A0.
- Reduces their cost if they choose A0 (as they just lose one point, redistributed).
- From an efficiency point of view, this doesn't help you much and could even harm.

For **Contract C2** (Proposed by you):
- Strongly incentivizes both players to choose A0.
- You gain significantly more if you both choose A0.
- If the opponent chooses the low-score option (A0) while you choose A1, their penalty is severe.
- Discourages both players from choosing A1 due to heavy penalties.
- Aligns better with your interest overall as it pushes to a high payoff equilibrium (both choosing A0).

### Conclusion

Given that your objective is to maximize your points, approving **Contract C1** would generally not favor your outcomes, whereas **Contract C2** does greatly favor you since you proposed it with a beneficial structure for your interests.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

response:
Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step, keeping in mind that:

- You are **Player 2**.
- The **contract was proposed by Player 1**, but **Player 2 rejected it**, so the **contract is not active**.
- You are playing the **original game without any contract modifications**.
- Your goal is to **maximize your expected points**.
- You and the other player (Player 1) choose probabilities over actions A0 and A1 **simultaneously**.
- You must choose a **probability distribution** (i.e., probabilities for A0 and A1 that sum to 100) — and output it as a JSON object.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

Since you are **Player 2**, the payoffs are as follows (rows = your action, columns = Player 1's action):

| Your Action \ Player 1's Action | A0          | A1          |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **A0**                         | 10          | 2           |
| **A1**                         | 20          | 4           |

So from your perspective:
- If you play A0:
  - If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 10
  - If Player 1 plays A1 → you get 2
- If you play A1:
  - If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20
  - If Player 1 plays A1 → you get 4

---

### Step 2: Determine Optimal Strategy

This is a **simultaneous-move game**, so we look for **Nash equilibrium**. Since the other player is rational and also wants to maximize their own payoff, we need to reason about best responses.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that Player 1 chooses A0
- $ 1 - p $ = probability that Player 1 chooses A1

Let’s compute your **expected payoff** for each of your actions:

- **If you choose A0**:  
  $ E[A0] = p \cdot 10 + (1-p) \cdot 2 = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $

- **If you choose A1**:  
  $ E[A1] = p \cdot 20 + (1-p) \cdot 4 = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4 $

Now determine for which values of $ p $ one action is better than the other.

Set $ E[A0] = E[A1] $ to find indifference point:
$$
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 \\
2 - 4 = 16p - 8p \\
-2 = 8p \\
p = -0.25
$$

This is **not possible** (probability can't be negative). So let’s check the sign.

Since $ 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 $ for all $ p \geq 0 $ (because the slope of E[A1] is steeper and even at p = 0: E[A1] = 4, E[A0] = 2), then:
- E[A1] > E[A0] for all valid p ∈ [0,1]

This means: **No matter what Player 1 does, your expected payoff from playing A1 is strictly higher than from A0**.

Wait — let’s double-check with concrete values:

- If p = 0 (Player 1 always plays A1):
  - E[A0] = 0 + 2 = 2
  - E[A1] = 0 + 4 = 4 → A1 better

- If p = 1 (Player 1 always plays A0):
  - E[A0] = 10
  - E[A1] = 20 → A1 better

- If p = 0.5:
  - E[A0] = 0.5×10 + 0.5×2 = 5 + 1 = 6
  - E[A1] = 0.5×20 + 0.5×4 = 10 + 2 = 12 → A1 better

So indeed, **A1 dominates A0** from your perspective. For any strategy of Player 1, you are better off playing A1.

Therefore, **your best response is always to play A1**, regardless of what Player 1 does.

Thus, the optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100%.

But **we should also consider that Player 1 might be rational**, and might anticipate this.

Let’s now think from **Player 1's perspective**, to see if they will play A0 or A1.

Player 1’s payoffs (since they are Player 1):

| Their Action \ Your Action | A0          | A1          |
|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **A0**                     | 10          | 0           |
| **A1**                     | 6           | 4           |

So Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If Player 1 chooses A0: $ q \cdot 10 + (1-q) \cdot 0 = 10q $
- If Player 1 chooses A1: $ q \cdot 6 + (1-q) \cdot 4 = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

Compare:
- 10q vs. 2q + 4
- Set equal: 10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So:
- If q < 0.5 (you play A0 with < 50%), Player 1 prefers A0
- If q > 0.5, Player 1 prefers A1
- At q = 0.5, indifferent

But you are **playing A1 with probability 1**, so q = 1.

Then:
- Player 1’s E[A0] = 10×1 = 10
- E[A1] = 2×1 + 4 = 6

So Player 1 will prefer A0, because 10 > 6.

Thus, **if you always play A1**, Player 1 best response is to play A0.

That gives you:
- You play A1
- Player 1 plays A0 → you get 20 points

Which is **very good** for you.

But wait — can you **exploit** this? Yes — you are playing A1, and if Player 1 is rational, they will play A0 (since playing A0 gives them 10 vs. the 6 they’d get if they played A1 when you play A1).

So **if you play A1 with certainty**, Player 1 will play A0 to maximize their own payoff.

Then outcome: (A1, A0) → you get 20.

What if you mix?

Suppose you play A0 with some probability — then Player 1 may respond differently.

For example, if you play A0 often, Player 1 might shift to playing A1.

But recall: **your payoff from A0 is always worse than from A1**, in comparison to the same Player 1 action.

In every case:
- If Player 1 plays A0: A1 gives you 20 vs A0 gives 10 → A1 better
- If Player 1 plays A1: A1 gives you 4 vs A0 gives 2 → A1 better

So **A1 is strictly dominant for you**.

Therefore, playing A0 is **never optimal**.

Even if you think Player 1 might play A1, still A1 pays better than A0 in both cases.

So **your dominant strategy is A1**.

Thus, you should **play A1 with probability 100%**.

Even if Player 1 plays A1, you get 4; if they play A0, you get 20 — you are getting at least 4 and potentially 20.

And since A1 is dominant, you should play it.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 100}

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understanding my position (Player 2)

Base game payoffs for me (P2):
- (A0, A0): I get 10
- (A1, A0): I get 20  
- (A0, A1): I get 2
- (A1, A1): I get 4

## Step 2: Analyzing the base game equilibrium

Without any contract, let me find the Nash equilibrium:
- If P1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If P1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 2)

So I have a dominant strategy to play A1. Given I play A1, P1's best response is A1 (4 > 0).

**Base game equilibrium: (A1, A1) giving me 4 points**

## Step 3: Analyzing Contract 1

With +10 payment for playing A0, the payoff matrix becomes:
```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0     10        12
P2: A1     10        4
```

- If P1 plays A0: I'm indifferent (10 = 10)
- If P1 plays A1: I strongly prefer A0 (12 > 4)
- For P1: A0 becomes dominant strategy (10 or 10 > -4 or 4)

**C1 equilibrium: P1 plays A0, I get 10 points** (regardless of whether I play A0 or A1)

## Step 4: Analyzing Contract 2

With +3 for A0 and -13 for A1, the payoff matrix becomes:
```
           P1: A0    P1: A1
P2: A0     10        18
P2: A1     10        4
```

- If P1 plays A0: I'm indifferent (10 = 10)  
- If P1 plays A1: I strongly prefer A0 (18 > 4)
- For P1: A0 becomes dominant strategy (10 or 16 > -10 or 4)

**C2 equilibrium: P1 plays A0, I get 10 points**

## Step 5: Comparison

- **Base game**: 4 points
- **Contract 1**: 10 points (upside of 12 if P1 deviates to A1)
- **Contract 2**: 10 points (upside of 18 if P1 deviates to A1)

Both contracts give me the same equilibrium payoff (10), which is much better than the base game (4). However, **C2 has a higher upside** (18 vs 12) if P1 ever plays A1, making it weakly better for me.

Since C2 is weakly preferred and gives the same equilibrium outcome, I should approve only C2 to maximize its chance of being selected.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game
Without any contract, let me find the Nash equilibrium:
- If I play A0 and opponent plays A1: I get 0 (very bad for me)
- If I play A1 and opponent plays A1: I get 4
- (A1, A1) is the Nash equilibrium, giving me **4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)
With C1, payments of +10/-10 are transferred when someone plays A0.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 10 + 10 - 10 = **10**
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 10 = **10** 
- (A1, A0): I get 6 - 10 = **-4**
- (A1, A1): I get **4**

Finding best responses:
- **Me:** A0 dominates A1 (I get 10 vs max 4)
- **Opponent given I play A0:** Indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give them 10)

Nash equilibrium: I play A0, opponent plays anything → **I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)
With C2, payments of +11/-11 are transferred when someone plays A0.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 10 + 11 - 11 = **10**
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 11 = **11**
- (A1, A0): I get 6 - 11 = **-5**
- (A1, A1): I get **4**

Finding best responses:
- **Me:** A0 dominates A1 (I get at least 10 vs max 4)
- **Opponent given I play A0:** Prefers A0 (10 points) over A1 (9 points)

Nash equilibrium: (A0, A0) → **I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Decision
Comparing outcomes:
- No contract: **4 points**
- C1: **10 points**
- C2: **10 points**

Both contracts give me 10 points at equilibrium, which is significantly better than the 4 points from no contract. While C2 provides slightly stronger coordination incentives (opponent strictly prefers A0), both achieve the same payoff for me.

I should approve both contracts to ensure that some contract is implemented, as either contract is strictly better than no contract.

1) **Analyze equilibrium with Contract C1 (A0 pays 1 to the other player):**  
- Modified payoffs still make **A1 strictly better for me (Player 2)** whether Player 1 plays A0 or A1.  
- So I still play **A1**. Player 1’s best response to my A1 is **A1**.  
- **Equilibrium remains (A1, A1)** with payoff **(4,4)** for (P2,P1).  
→ C1 does not improve my outcome versus the baseline equilibrium.

2) **Analyze equilibrium with Contract C2 (A1 pays 5 to the other player):**  
- For Player 1, **A0 becomes a dominant action** (it yields higher payoff than A1 no matter what I do). So Player 1 plays **A0**.  
- Given Player 1 plays A0, my best response is **A1** (I get 15 vs 10 if I played A0).  
- **Equilibrium becomes (P2 A1, P1 A0)** with payoff **(15,5)** for (P2,P1).  
→ This is much better for me than 4 under C1.

3) **Voting strategy:**  
- I want to avoid any chance of C1 being selected (since it gives me 4 vs 15 under C2).  
- So I **approve only C2** and **reject C1**.

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Modified Payoffs

First, I need to incorporate the contract into the base payoffs. The contract states:
- Choosing A0 gives +2 points (taken from opponent)
- Choosing A1 costs -2 points (given to opponent)

Let me calculate the final payoffs for each outcome:

**When I play A0:**
- vs A0: 10 (base) + 2 (my A0 bonus) - 2 (their A0 bonus) = **10**
- vs A1: 2 (base) + 2 (my A0 bonus) + 2 (their A1 penalty) = **6**

**When I play A1:**
- vs A0: 20 (base) - 2 (my A1 penalty) - 2 (their A0 bonus) = **16**
- vs A1: 4 (base) - 2 (my A1 penalty) + 2 (their A1 penalty) = **4**

My payoff matrix:
```
           Other: A0    Other: A1
Me: A0        10           6
Me: A1        16           4
```

## Step 2: Analyze the Other Player's Perspective

The other player's payoff matrix:
```
           Me: A0    Me: A1
Other: A0    10        4
Other: A1     2        4
```

Notice that A0 **weakly dominates** A1 for the other player (10 ≥ 2, and 4 ≥ 4).

## Step 3: Determine My Best Response

If the other player rationally chooses A0 (their weakly dominant strategy):
- My A0 gives me 10 points
- My A1 gives me **16 points** ✓

If the other player chooses A1:
- My A0 gives me **6 points** ✓
- My A1 gives me 4 points

## Step 4: Find the Equilibrium

The outcome (A1, A0) is a Nash equilibrium:
- I get 16 (my best payoff)
- They get 4
- Neither player wants to unilaterally deviate

Since the other player is likely to play A0 (weakly dominant) and I want to maximize my points, I should play A1 with certainty.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

response:
Let's go step by step to determine whether you, as **Player 2**, should approve or disapprove each of the two proposed contracts.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are told:
- You are **Player 2**.
- You choose a probability distribution over actions A0 and A1.
- So does the other player (Player 1).
- The outcome depends on both choices.
- Payoffs (given from **your perspective**, i.e., Player 2):

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 10          | 10                     |
| A1          | A0                     | 20          | 0                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 2           | 6                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 4           | 4                      |

So from **your** (Player 2) point of view:
- If you play A1 and they play A0 → **20 points** (best outcome for you)
- If you play A0 and they play A1 → **only 2 points** (worst for you)
- If both play A0 → 10 points
- Both play A1 → 4 points

So your best outcome is A1 vs A0 (you win 20), but if you play A0 and they play A1, you get only 2.

This is a **non-symmetric** game, and Player 1 has a dominant strategy? Let’s see.

But more importantly: you’re trying to **maximize your expected score**, and you’ll also care about **what contract is likely to be selected** — but only **if you approve** it.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**
- If a player chooses **A0**, they get an **additional 10 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
- If a player chooses **A1**, no additional payment.

So:
- If you choose A0 → +10 points **from your own pocket? No. It says "drawn equally from the other player"**.
  - **Important**: "drawn equally from the other players" → plural? But only two players. So probably means: **10 points are taken from the other player and given to you**.

So:
- If both choose A0 → you get +10, other player gets -10 → net effect:
  - Your new payoff: 10 + 10 = **20**
  - Other player: 10 - 10 = **0**
- If you choose A0, they choose A1 → you get +10, they get -10:
  - You: 2 + 10 = **12**
  - Other: 6 - 10 = **-4**
- If you choose A1, they choose A0 → you get 0 extra, they get +10:
  - You: 20 + 0 = **20**
  - Other: 0 + 10 = **10**
- If you choose A1, they choose A1 → both get 0 extra:
  - You: 4, other: 4

Let’s tabulate the **adjusted payoffs under C1** (from your view, Player 2):

| Your A | Opp A | Original | C1 Adjusted (Your Points) |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------------------|
| A0     | A0    | 10       | 10 + 10 = **20**           |
| A1     | A0    | 20       | 20 + 0 = **20**            |
| A0     | A1    | 2        | 2 + 10 = **12**            |
| A1     | A1    | 4        | 4 + 0 = **4**              |

Now for other player:
| Your A | Opp A | Original | C1 Adjusted (Opp Points) |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------------------|
| A0     | A0    | 10       | 10 - 10 = 0                |
| A1     | A0    | 0        | 0 + 10 = 10                |
| A0     | A1    | 6        | 6 - 10 = -4                |
| A1     | A1    | 4        | 4                          |

So under **C1**, your payoffs are:
- A0 vs A0 → 20
- A1 vs A0 → 20
- A0 vs A1 → 12
- A1 vs A1 → 4

Now, **what does this mean?** You **prefer A0 when they play A0**, but **A1 is still fine** against A0.

But now, if **they play A1**, you **don’t want to play A0** (you get 12), but A1 gives you only 4 → so you'd definitely want to avoid A0 if they play A1.

Now, **what is your optimal strategy under C1?**

Let’s suppose the other player plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p).

Then your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 20·p + 12·(1−p) = 20p + 12 − 12p = 8p + 12
- If you play A1: 20·p + 4·(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Compare:
- A0: 8p + 12
- A1: 16p + 4

Set equal: 8p + 12 = 16p + 4 → 8 = 8p → p = 1

So:
- If p > 1 → impossible
- At p = 1: equal
- For p < 1: 16p + 4 > 8p + 12 → so A1 is **strictly better** when p < 1, even if slightly.

Wait: At p = 1 → both give 20 → equal
At p = 0 → A0 gives 12, A1 gives 4 → A0 better
But at p = 0.5:
- A0: 8(0.5) + 12 = 4 + 12 = 16
- A1: 16(0.5) + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 → A0 better

So only when p is high does A1 beat A0?

Wait, this seems backward. Let me double-check:

At p = 0.5:
- You play A0: 50% chance A0→20, 50% A1→12 → 0.5×20 + 0.5×12 = 10 + 6 = 16
- You play A1: 0.5×20 + 0.5×4 = 10 + 2 = 12 → A0 better

At p = 0.8:
- A0: 8×0.8 + 12 = 6.4 + 12 = 18.4
- A1: 16×0.8 + 4 = 12.8 + 4 = 16.8 → A0 still better

At p = 1: both 20 → equal

At p = 0:
- A0: 12
- A1: 4 → A0 better

So **A0 is always better or equal under C1**, no matter what p is.

Is that true?

Wait: Compare A0: 8p + 12
A1: 16p + 4

Difference: (8p + 12) − (16p + 4) = −8p + 8 = 8(1 − p)

So:
- If p < 1 → 8(1−p) > 0 → A0 > A1
- If p = 1 → equal

So **you always prefer A0 unless p=1**, and even then it’s equal.

So **under C1, your best response is always A0**, regardless of what the other player does.

That’s powerful. So C1 **forces** you to want to play A0.

But is that good for *you*? Let's think.

But we're not just looking at best response — we are to **approve** or **disapprove** the contract.

So now go to C2.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **11 points**, drawn equally from the other player.
- If A1, no additional payment.

So same as C1, but **+11 instead of +10**.

Let’s compute your adjusted payoffs under C2:

| Your A | Opp A | Original | C2 Adjusted (Your Points) |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------------------|
| A0     | A0    | 10       | 10 + 11 = **21**           |
| A1     | A0    | 20       | 20 + 0 = **20**            |
| A0     | A1    | 2        | 2 + 11 = **13**            |
| A1     | A1    | 4        | 4 + 0 = **4**              |

So your payoffs:
- A0 vs A0 → 21
- A1 vs A0 → 20
- A0 vs A1 → 13
- A1 vs A1 → 4

Now compute expected payoffs:
Let p = prob other player plays A0

- Your expected payoff if you play A0: 21p + 13(1−p) = 21p + 13 −13p = 8p + 13
- If you play A1: 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 −4p = 16p + 4

Compare:
- A0: 8p + 13
- A1: 16p + 4

Set equal: 8p + 13 = 16p + 4 → 13−4 = 8p → 9 = 8p → p = 9/8 = 1.125 → impossible

So no solution? Let’s see when A0 > A1:

8p + 13 > 16p + 4 → 9 > 8p → p < 9/8 → always true since p ≤ 1

So for all p ∈ [0,1]:
8p + 13 > 16p + 4 (since 13−4 = 9 > 8p → true for p ≤ 1)

So **A0 is strictly better than A1 for all p**.

Even stronger than C1.

So under **C2**, you also always want to play A0.

---

### **Step 3: Compare Contracts from Your Perspective**

We now have:

| Contract | Your Optimal Strategy | Resulting Payoff if Both Follow Self-Interested Strategy |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| C1     | Always play A0         | If other plays A0 → 20; if other plays A1 → 12 → Expected depends on their p |
| C2     | Always play A0         | If other plays A0 → 21; if other plays A1 → 13 |

But you have to ask: **Do you want to approve the contract?**

But the **contract is only in effect if it’s approved**, and the winner is chosen **uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals**.

So you want to **approve contracts that benefit you**, **but also consider the approval dynamics**.

---

### **Step 4: Think About What the Other Player Will Do**

The contracts are proposed:
- C1 by Player 1
- C2 by Player 2

You are **Player 2**, so C2 is **your own proposal**.

Now, will **Player 1** approve C1? Probably — because C1 gives them **+10** if they play A0, and takes 10 from you.

But what about **your own contract (C2)** — will **Player 1** approve it? Probably **not**.

Let’s see why.

#### Analyze C1 (Proposed by Player 1)

From **Player 1’s** point of view (the one who proposed it), under C1:

- If they play A0 → +10 from you, so their payoff increases by 10
- If they play A1 → no change
- So if you play A0, they gain 10; if you play A1, they gain nothing.

So:
- A0 vs A0 → original 10 → now 20
- A0 vs A1 → original 6 → now 6 −10 = −4
- A1 vs A0 → original 0 → now 0 +10 = 10
- A1 vs A1 → original 4 → 4

So their expected payoffs under C1:
- If you play A0: 20 (if they play A0), 10 (if they play A1)
- If you play A1: −4 (if they play A0), 4 (if they play A1)

So if you play A0 → they prefer A0 (20 > 10)
If you play A1 → they prefer A1 (4 > −4)

So **they prefer A0 if you play A0**, and **A1 if you play A1**

But earlier we saw that **you**, as Player 2, under C1, always prefer A0

So if **both act rationally**, you both play A0 → payoff: (20, 0) → you get 20, they get 0

Wait: under C1, if both play A0:
- You: 10 + 10 = 20
- They: 10 −10 = 0

That’s **bad for Player 1**.

But they **proposed C1** — will they approve it?

Let’s evaluate **whether Player 1 would approve C1**, given that they know you’ll act optimally.

But you are not acting to maximize *their* gains; you are acting to maximize *your* gains.

Under C1, **you will always play A0** (as we saw), regardless of what they do.

So if C1 is in effect, you will play A0.

Then Player 1 is forced to choose between:
- Play A0: gain 20 (original 10, plus 10 from you)
- Play A1: gain 10 (original 0, plus 10 from you)

So best is to play A0 → you both play A0 → payoff: you get 20, they get 20? Wait no:

Wait: **When A0 is played by a player, they get +10 from the other**.

So:
- You play A0 → get +10 from them
- They play A0 → get +10 from you

Yes!

So both play A0:
- You get: 10 (base) +10 (from them) = 20
- They get: 10 (base) +10 (from you) = 20

Oh! I made a mistake earlier.

Let’s fix that.

#### Corrected C1:
- If **a player** chooses A0, they get +10, **drawn from the other player**.
- So: when **both** play A0: each gets +10 → so **both get 10 + 10 = 20**

When **you** play A0, **they** play A1:
- You get: 2 (base) +10 = 12
- They get: 6 (base) −10 = −4

When **you** play A1, **they** play A0:
- You get: 20 (base) + 0 = 20
- They get: 0 (base) +10 = 10

When both play A1: both get 4 + 0 = 4

So payoff table for C1 (from your view, Player 2):

| Your A | Opp A | Your Points |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| A0     | A0    | 20          |
| A1     | A0    | 20          |
| A0     | A1    | 12          |
| A1     | A1    | 4           |

Same as before.

Now, **Player 1** (Opponent) under C1:

| Their A | Your A | Their Points |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| A0      | A0     | 20           |
| A0      | A1     | -4           |
| A1      | A0     | 10           |
| A1      | A1     | 4            |

So if **you play A0**, they:
- A0 → 20
- A1 → 10 → so they prefer A0

If **you play A1**, they:
- A0 → −4
- A1 → 4 → so prefer A1

But you, under C1, **will always play A0** (as we showed: A0 is always better than A1 for you)

So they know you’ll play A0 → they will play A0 → both play A0 → payoff (20, 20)

So **C1 is good for Player 1**: they get 20.

But earlier I said they get 0 — wrong.

They **get** the +10 from you — because you played A0.

So yes, **C1 is favorable for Player 1**.

Hence, **Player 1 will approve C1**.

Similarly, now look at **C2**, proposed by **you**, Player 2.

C2: If a player plays A0, they get +11 from the other player.

So under C2, payoff table for **you** (Player 2):

| Your A | Opp A | Your Points |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| A0     | A0    | 10 +11 = 21 |
| A1     | A0    | 20          |
| A0     | A1    | 2 +11 = 13  |
| A1     | A1    | 4           |

So you always prefer A0, as before.

Now **Player 1**’s payoff under C2:

| Their A | Your A | Their Points |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| A0      | A0     | 10 −11 = -1  |
| A0      | A1     | 6 −11 = -5   |
| A1      | A0     | 0 +11 = 11   |
| A1      | A1     | 4            |

So if you play A0 → they:
- A0 → -1
- A1 → 11 → prefer A1
If you play A1 → they:
- A0 → -5
- A1 → 4 → prefer A1

But you, as Player 2, will play A0 under C2 (best response).

So they know you play A0 → they prefer A1 (11 > -1)

So under C2, if both play self-interestedly:
- You: A0
- They: A1
→ Outcome: you play A0, they play A1 → your payoff: 2 +11 = 13
Their payoff: 6 −11 = -5

So **you get 13 points**, which is **less than 20** under C1.

But **Player 1 gets -5**, which is worse than under C1 (where they got 20), so clearly **Player 1 will not approve C2**.

In fact, **C2 gives them a negative payoff** if they play A0, and they avoid that by playing A1.

But even then, they get 11, while under C1 they get 20.

So **Player 1 has no incentive to approve C2**.

Now, back to you: as Player 2, should you approve **C1** or **C2**?

But approval is **independent** — you can approve or disapprove each.

But the **winning contract** is chosen uniformly at random among **those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So we need to consider:

- Who approves what?

Let’s suppose:
- **C1** (by Player 1): Player 1 will approve it.
- Player 1 will **not** approve C2 (as it gives them negative payoff in equilibrium).

- **C2** (by Player 2): **You** (Player 2) might approve it.

But you are self-interested: do you want to approve C2?

Let’s compare expected payoffs under different contracts.

---

### **Step 5: Compare Your Payoff Under Each Contract**

#### Under **C1** (if adopted):

As established, both players will play A0 → since:
- You prefer A0 always
- Player 1, knowing you play A0, prefers A0 (20 vs 10)

So final action: both A0 → you get **20 points**

#### Under **C2**:

You play A0 (best response)
Player 1 plays A1 (best response to your A0: 11 > −1)

So outcome: you A0, they A1 → you get **13 points**

So **C2 gives you only 13**, while **C1 gives you 20**

So **C1 is better for you**

But can you **approve C2**? That risks **not getting the contract**, because the other player won’t approve it.

But if you **do not approve C2**, then only C1 has approval (by Player 1) → so C1 wins.

If you **approve both**, then:
- C1: approved by Player 1 → 1 vote
- C2: approved by Player 1? No → only by you → 1 vote
- So both have 1 approval → maximum = 1 → winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance for C1, 50% for C2

But if you **approve C2**, and C2 is picked, you get **13 points** instead of **20**.

So you **lose 7 points in expectation**.

Expected payoff if you approve both:
- 0.5 chance C1: you get 20
- 0.5 chance C2: you get 13
→ Expected: 0.5×20 + 0.5×13 = 10 + 6.5 = **16.5**

But if you **only approve C1**, then C1 wins (since only C1 has approval), you get **20**

So **by approving C2**, you **reduce your expected payoff** from 20 → 16.5

Hence, **you should not approve C2**

But wait: **if you don’t approve C2**, and C2 is not approved by anyone else, then C2 has 0 approvals → C1 has 1 → C1 wins → you get 20

But if you **approve C2**, you get **16.5 in expectation**, which is **worse**.

So **you should not approve C2**

But what if both approve C2? Then C2 has 2 approvals → C1 has 1 → C2 wins → you get 13

Even worse.

So **no scenario benefits you from approving C2**.

Therefore, **you should approve C1 and disapprove C2**

But you **can’t** force C2 to be adopted — you need approval from both.

But since you are maximizing your **expected points**, the best outcome is:

- Approve C1 → C1 wins → you get 20
- Do not approve C2 → even if C2 is proposed, it cannot win

If you approve C2, you risk getting a worse outcome.

So the rational move: **approve only C1**

But is C1 really safe?

Yes: Player 1 will approve C1 (they benefit), you approve C1 → 2 approvals → C1 wins → you get 20

If you **don’t approve C1**, then C1 has only 1 approval → C2 has only 0 or 1 (if you approve it) → but then max is 1, and C1 might not win.

But you **want C1 to win**.

So to ensure that C1 is selected, you should **approve it**

And **not approve C2**, because approving it harms your expected payoff.

---

### **Final Decision**

- **C1 (Player 1’s contract)**: You should approve it → leads to 20 points for you
- **C2 (Your own contract)**: You should **not approve** it → because if approved, it risks reducing your expected payoff

Even though it’s your proposal, it’s **not beneficial for you** — you get only 13 in equilibrium.

So **approval decision**:

- C1: approve → true
- C2: disapprove → false

---

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Let's walk through this decision-making problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (without contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game between two players. Each chooses an action: A0 or A1, with a probability (mixed strategy). The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

|                | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

As **Player 1**, we're interested in maximizing our own expected payoff.

Let’s analyze the base game to understand rational play.

---

### **Step 2: Find Nash Equilibrium in the Base Game**

Let’s suppose Player 2 chooses A0 with probability $ q $, A1 with probability $ 1-q $.

Player 1's expected payoff:

- If Player 1 chooses A0:  
  $$
  EU_1(A0) = q \cdot 10 + (1 - q) \cdot 0 = 10q
  $$

- If Player 1 chooses A1:  
  $$
  EU_1(A1) = q \cdot 6 + (1 - q) \cdot 4 = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4
  $$

Player 1 is indifferent when:
$$
10q = 2q + 4 \Rightarrow 8q = 4 \Rightarrow q = 0.5
$$

So Player 1 is indifferent when Player 2 plays A0 with 50% chance.

Now consider Player 2’s incentives.

Player 2’s payoffs:

- If Player 2 plays A0:  
  $ EU_2(A0) = p \cdot 10 + (1 - p) \cdot 2 = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $

- If Player 2 plays A1:  
  $ EU_2(A1) = p \cdot 20 + (1 - p) \cdot 4 = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4 $

Set equal for indifference:
$$
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 \Rightarrow -8p = 2 \Rightarrow p = -0.25
$$

Wait—this is **not possible** (probability can't be negative). So the best response for Player 2 is to **always play A1**, because even at p = 0, $ EU_2(A1) = 4 $, $ EU_2(A0) = 2 $. At p = 1, $ EU_2(A1) = 20 $, $ EU_2(A0) = 10 $. So A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2.

Similarly, for Player 1:
- A1 gives at least 4, A0 gives 0 when Player 2 plays A1 → A0 is worse than A1 when Player 2 plays A1
- When Player 2 plays A0, A0 gives 10, A1 gives 6 → A0 better

But since Player 2 **strictly prefers A1** regardless of Player 1’s action, rational Player 2 will play A1 for sure.

Then Player 1’s best response to Player 2 playing A1 is:
- A0: 0 points
- A1: 4 points

Thus, **Player 1 should play A1**.

So the unique Nash equilibrium is:
- Player 1: A1 (with probability 1)
- Player 2: A1 (with probability 1)

Result: (A1, A1) → you get **4 points**

But this isn’t optimal from a social welfare perspective. The (A0, A0) outcome gives 10 to each — a **Pareto improvement** over (4,4). So if cooperation were possible, both would prefer A0.

But in the base game, there’s no mechanism to enforce this.

Now we get to the **contract system**, which can alter incentives.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contracts**

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they **pay an additional 1 point**, distributed **equally among the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:  
- If **you** play A0 → you lose 1 point (net cost)  
- That 1 point is **split equally** among the other players → since only two players, **each other player** receives 0.5 points.

But note: **"distributed equally among the other players"** → in a two-player game, if you pay 1 point to the other player, they get 1 point.

Wait: “equally among the other players” — if one other player, then they get the full 1 point.

So:
- If you play A0 → you lose 1 point, the other player gains 1 point.

But this is **from your perspective only** — you are not the other player.

So, **from Player 1’s view (you)**:

- If **you** choose A0 → you pay 1 → you lose 1 point in the contract
- The **other player (Player 2)** gains 1 point (from you)

- If **Player 2** chooses A0 → Player 2 pays 1 → **you (Player 1)** gain 1 point

- If either chooses A1 → no payment.

So the **contract changes** the payoff matrix.

Let’s recompute the **effective payoff matrix under C1**.

---

### **Step 4: Compute Payoffs Under Contract C1**

We’ll compute **total payoff** for Player 1 (you), including base payoffs and contract payments.

Let’s define the new payoffs.

**Case 1: (A0, A0)**  
- Base: (10, 10)  
- Contract: both play A0 → both pay 1 →  
  - You pay 1 → -1  
  - You gain 1 (from Player 2’s payment) → +1  
  → Net contract effect: 0  
- So total for you: 10 + 0 = **10**

- Player 2: also 10 (base) + 1 (from you) - 1 (paid) = 10

Wait — that can't be right.

Let’s be precise:

If a player chooses A0, they **pay 1 point**, which is **distributed equally to other players**.

So:
- When you play A0 → you **lose 1**
- The other player (Player 2) **gains 1**
- When Player 2 plays A0 → Player 2 loses 1, you gain 1

So in (A0, A0):
- You: base = 10, contract = (-1 from your A0) + (+1 from Player 2’s A0) = 0 → **10 total**
- Player 2: base = 10, contract = (-1 from their A0) + (+1 from your A0) = 0 → **10 total**

So no net change. Payoff remains (10,10)

**Case 2: (A0, A1)**  
- Base: (0, 20)  
- You play A0 → you pay 1 → -1  
- Player 2 plays A1 → no payment from them  
- But Player 2’s action doesn’t trigger cost

Contract: only when A0 is played.

So:
- You: -1 from contract
- Player 2: 0 from contract

So total:
- You: 0 (base) - 1 = **-1**
- Player 2: 20 + 0 = 20

**Case 3: (A1, A0)**  
- Base: (6, 2)
- You: A1 → no cost
- Player 2: A0 → player 2 pays 1 → you gain 1
- You gain 1 from contract

So:
- You: 6 + 1 = **7**
- Player 2: 2 - 1 = **1**

**Case 4: (A1, A1)**  
- Base: (4, 4)
- No one pays → no contract changes
- So: (4, 4)

So the new payoff matrix under C1:

|                | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**     | (10, 10) | (-1, 20) |
| **P1: A1**     | (7, 1)   | (4, 4)   |

Now let’s analyze this game.

Player 1’s incentives:

- A0: 10 vs -1 → best response depends on what P2 does
- A1: 7 vs 4

But we can look for Nash equilibrium.

Let’s compute best responses.

Player 1’s expected payoff if Player 2 plays A0 with prob q:

- A0: 10q + (-1)(1−q) = 10q −1 + q = 11q −1
- A1: 7q + 4(1−q) = 7q + 4 − 4q = 3q + 4

Set equal:
11q −1 = 3q + 4 → 8q = 5 → q = 5/8 = 0.625

So if P2 plays A0 with > 0.625, P1 prefers A0; else A1.

Now for Player 2:

- If P1 plays A0 with prob p

Player 2’s payoff:

- A0: 10p + 1(1−p) = 10p + 1 − p = 9p + 1
- A1: 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal:
9p + 1 = 16p + 4 → -7p = 3 → p = -3/7 → impossible.

Since 16p + 4 > 9p + 1 for all p ≥ 0 → A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2.

So Player 2 will **always play A1**.

Then Player 1’s best response:  
- A0: -1 (if P2 plays A1)  
- A1: 4  
→ So best response: A1

Thus, Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → payoff: (4, 4)

Same as before.

But now, we are interested in **contract approval** — you are deciding whether to approve C1.

Even though the equilibrium didn’t change, **could it help induce cooperation?**

But **since A1 still dominates A0 for Player 2**, and A1 is better for Player 1, **no change in outcome**.

However, the **contract is proposed by Player 1**, and it **reduces the payoff for A0** — which might discourage A0, but **why would you want to discourage A0?** Because when you choose A0, you get penalized (you lose 1), but the other player gains 1.

But in the (A0, A0) case, you still get 10 — but you **have to pay 1** to get that.

Wait — no: in (A0, A0), you **pay 1**, but you **receive 1** from the other player — so it cancels.

So the only costs are when you play A0 **and** the other doesn’t — then you pay 1 and get nothing back.

So in (A0, A1): you get -1 instead of 0 → worse

In (A1, A0): you get +1 extra → better

So effectively, C1 **deters unilateral A0**, but encourages A0 **only if both play it**.

But since Player 2 still has no incentive to play A0 (because even if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 1 vs 20 when playing A1), so P2 will never play A0.

Thus, **C1 is ineffective** — it doesn’t change behavior.

Moreover, **you (P1)** are worse off when you play A0 unilaterally.

But in the equilibrium, both play A1 — so you get 4, same as before.

So C1 doesn’t improve your payoff.

But **does it hurt you**?

In the original game, you get 4 (in equilibrium).

In C1 game, you still get 4 — **same**.

But if someone foolishly plays A0, you could **get more** (e.g., in (A1, A0) you get 7 instead of 6), but that’s only if Player 2 plays A0.

But Player 2 has **no reason to play A0**.

So C1 **does not improve your situation**, and **might discourage cooperation** if someone else believes C1 would help.

But since it doesn’t change the equilibrium, and you get same payoff, but **you pay a penalty when you play A0 unilaterally**, which is bad.

So **why approve C1?**

Only if you believe it makes cooperation more likely.

But it does not. Player 2 still doesn’t want to play A0 — so **no cooperative outcome possible**.

So **C1 is bad for you**.

Wait — what if **both** players are rational, and **you** want to **push** for (A0, A0)?

C1 *does not help* that. Because you **are penalized for playing A0**, even when both do it (the cost and benefit cancel, but you still pay).

But if you could coordinate on a contract that **rewards A0**, that would be better.

But C1 **punishes** A0.

So **C1 is not beneficial for you**.

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they **receive an additional payment of 5 points**, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get 5 points **from the other player(s)**
- If the other player plays A0 → they get 5 points from you

So: **you gain 5** when you play A0

- But that money is taken from the other player → they **lose 5**

In a two-player game:
- If you play A0 → you gain 5, and **Player 2 loses 5**
- If Player 2 plays A0 → Player 2 gains 5, you lose 5

Let’s recompute payoff matrix under C2.

**Case 1: (A0, A0)**  
- Base: 10,10  
- Contract: you gain 5, Player 2 gains 5  
→ Total: (15, 15)

**Case 2: (A0, A1)**  
- Base: (0, 20)  
- You play A0 → gain 5  
- Player 2 plays A1 → no payment  
→ Contract: you get +5, Player 2 gets 0  
→ Total: (0 + 5, 20) = (5, 20)

**Case 3: (A1, A0)**  
- Base: (6, 2)  
- You: A1 → no gain  
- Player 2: A0 → gets 5 from you → you lose 5  
→ You: 6 - 5 = 1  
→ Player 2: 2 + 5 = 7  
→ (1, 7)

**Case 4: (A1, A1)**  
- Base: (4, 4)  
- No one plays A0 → no payments  
→ (4, 4)

So new matrix under C2:

|                | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**     | (15, 15) | (5, 20) |
| **P1: A1**     | (1, 7)   | (4, 4)  |

Now, let’s analyze.

Player 1’s incentives:

- A0: 15 vs 5 → both better than A1
- So A0 dominates A1 for Player 1 (15 > 1, 5 > 4)

Player 1 will **always play A0**.

Now Player 2:

- If P1 plays A0:  
  - If P2 plays A0: gets 15  
  - If P2 plays A1: gets 20  
  → So prefers A1 → **plays A1**

Thus: P2 plays A1 (even though they get 15 vs 20 in A0 vs A1, but P1 plays A0)

So outcome: (A0, A1) → you get **5**, Player 2 gets 20

But wait — is this the only equilibrium?

P1 plays A0 always → best response

P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A1 (20 > 15) → so best response is A1

Thus: **(A0, A1)** is the unique Nash equilibrium under C2.

Payoff: **(5, 20)**

But this is **worse for you** than the base game equilibrium (where you got 4), but now you get **5**.

Wait — in base game, (A1,A1) → 4 points

Here: (A0,A1) → 5 points

So you get **5** → better.

But Player 2 gets 20 — which is good for them.

But is this the **best possible?**

What if both played A0? Then you get 15 — but **Player 2 won't do it**, because if they play A0, they get 15, but if they play A1, they get 20 — so **they won't cooperate**.

So (A0,A0) is not sustainable because Player 2 has no incentive to play A0.

So outcome is (A0, A1) → you get 5.

But earlier in base game, you get 4 → now **you get 5** — **better**.

So C2 gives you **5** in equilibrium vs 4 in base game → **improves your payoff**.

So **you should approve C2**, because it makes you better off.

Is that right? Let’s double-check.

In C2:
- P1 is better off playing A0 even if P2 plays A1 → gets 5 > 4
- P2, knowing P1 will play A0 (because A0 is dominant), will play A1 (20 > 15)
- So (A0, A1) → you get 5

Yes.

And in base game, you get 4.

So **C2 improves your payoff**.

But what if Player 2 tries to play A0? But they wouldn’t — because they lose.

So yes, **you get 5 > 4**, so C2 is **beneficial**.

Moreover, **C2 rewards A0**, so it encourages you to play A0 — which is beneficial *because* when Player 2 plays A1 (which they will), you get 5 instead of 0.

So C2 **benefits you**.

But now: **Why would you approve C2?** Because it increases your payoff from 4 to 5.

But wait — what about C1?

C1 gives you 4 — same as base game → no improvement.

And it has a **cost of playing A0**, which is bad.

So you should **not approve C1**.

C2: improves your payoff → **approve**

But wait — the contract is a **proposal** by **Player 2**.

You (Player 1) can **approve** or **not approve**.

The winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So you must decide: **Which contracts do you approve?**

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, so you should:

- Approve any contract that increases your payoff **in the final equilibrium**
- But note: if **no contract is approved**, no contract is enforced — you play the base game.

So, **if you approve only C2**, and not C1:

- C1: disapproved
- C2: approved
- So C2 is the only approved contract → it becomes the winning contract

Then the game is played under C2 → you get **5 points**

If you approve both, then both are approved → winning contract is chosen uniformly at random between C1 and C2

Then you get:

- With 50% probability: C1 → you get 4
- With 50% probability: C2 → you get 5

Expected payoff: (4 + 5)/2 = 4.5

Which is **better than 4**, but **worse than 5**

But is it better than just approving C2?

Yes — 4.5 > 4

But wait: if you approve **both**, you get **4.5**

If you approve **only C2**, you get **5** → better!

So **approving both is worse** than approving only C2.

So **you should not approve C1**, because it lowers your expected payoff when tied.

Similarly, if you approve **neither**, you get **4** → worse than 5.

So the optimal is to **approve only C2**.

Now, what if **Player 2 approves C2**, but you don't?

Then C2 is **not approved** (requires approval), so no contract → base game → you get 4.

But if **you approve C2**, and **Player 2 also approves C2**, then C2 has approval → it wins.

But **we don't know what Player 2 approves** — but the question is: **you** decide whether to approve each contract **to maximize your expected points**.

You are not told what Player 2 approves.

But the **contract wins** if **approved by at least one player** and has **maximum approvals**.

Actually, let’s re-read:

> "The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So we must think **strategically**: what if C2 is **approved by both**, or **only by you**, or **by no one**?

But **your decision affects the approval count**.

So let’s model this.

You can choose to approve C1 and C2.

Let’s consider your **expected payoff** given your choice.

Assume **Player 2's approval is fixed** — but it's not given.

Actually, **Player 2** is the other player — you don’t know their preferences.

But the question is: **you** are to approve or disapprove contracts to **maximize your own expected payoff**.

So you must **assume that the outcome depends on both your and Player 2’s approval**.

But you **don’t know Player 2’s behavior**.

However, since Player 2 is rational and wants to maximize **their own** points, we can **predict** what they would do.

But you are told: **Player 2's proposal is C2** — so you can suppose they want C2 to pass.

But would **Player 2** approve C2?

Let’s check: would **Player 2** approve C2?

Player 2 gets to **approve** C2.

Under C2, if approved, what does **Player 2** get?

In the outcome (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 20

In (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 15

But Player 2 would **want A1** if P1 plays A0 → so they get 20.

So under C2, **Player 2 gets 20** (in equilibrium), which is better than base game (where they get 20 in (A0,A1)? Wait.

In base game: (A1,A1) → Player 2 gets 4

Under C2: (A0,A1) → Player 2 gets 20 → **huge gain**

So **Player 2 will definitely approve C2**.

Similarly, would they approve C1?

C1: if approved, what do they get?

Under C1: outcome is (A1,A1) → Player 2 gets 4

Same as base game → no gain.

But if they play A0 unilaterally, they get less (e.g., in (A0,A1), they get 20 minus 1 paid? No)

Wait — under C1:

In (A0,A1): Player 2 gets 20 (base) + 0 (no receipt, since they played A1)
→ 20

But in (A1,A1): 4

But in (A0,A0): 10

But no incentive to play A0.

So equilibrium: (A1,A1) → Player 2 gets 4

Same as base game.

So **no gain** → **Player 2 has no reason to approve C1**.

Moreover, if they approve C1, it might reduce their payoff if they play A0, but they won’t.

So **Player 2 will not approve C1**.

Thus, **only C2 is approved by Player 2**.

Now you: do you approve C1?

If you approve C1, and Player 2 approves C2, then:

- C1: approved by 1 (you)
- C2: approved by 2 (you + Player 2)

→ C2 has more approvals → **C2 wins** → you get 5

So if you approve C1, you still get 5

But is there any risk?

No — because C2 is enforced anyway.

But if you approve C1, you are just **adding a useless approval**, but no downside.

But what if **Player 2 doesn't approve C2**?

But earlier we said **Player 2 will approve C2**, because they get 20 instead of 4.

So **Player 2 will approve C2**.

But could they be indifferent?

No — 20 > 4 → strong incentive.

So **Player 2 approves C2 for sure**.

Now does Player 2 approve C1? As above, no — it gives them 4, same as base, but **if they play A0**, they pay 1 and get nothing back — bad.

So **Player 2 will not approve C1**.

So only C2 is approved by Player 2.

If you **approve C1**, then:
- C1: approved by 1
- C2: approved by 2

→ max approvals: 2 → C2 wins → you get 5

If you **don't approve C1**, same thing → C2 wins → you get 5

So **there is no difference** — you get 5 either way.

But **if you approve C1**, is there a downside?

No — you get the same payoff.

But could the random selection cause trouble?

No — C2 has higher approvals (2), so it wins.

But what if **the game rules say** that you need **at least one approval** for a contract to be considered?

But no — the winning contract is selected from those **with maximum approvals**.

So even if C1 is approved by you, C2 wins.

So **approving C1 gives you no benefit**, but **no cost**.

But since **you are maximizing your payoff**, and **both options give 5**, you are indifferent.

But wait — is there **any reason to approve C1**?

No.

But **what if you approve C1 and not C2**?

Then C1 has 1 approval (yours), C2 has 0 → so C1 wins → you get 4

Worse than 5.

So you cannot **only approve C1** — that would be bad.

You **must approve C2**? Or not?

Let’s analyze possible outcomes.

Case 1: You approve C2 → C2 has at least 1 approval → if Player 2 approves C2 (which they do), then C2 has 2 approvals → C2 wins → you get 5

Case 2: You do **not** approve C2 → C2 has 0 approvals → not selected

Then only C1 might be approved.

If you also approve C1 → C1 has 1 approval → wins → you get 4

If you do not approve C1 → no contract → base game → you get 4

So best you can do if you **don’t approve C2** is 4

But if you **approve C2**, you get **5** (since Player 2 will approve it)

So **you should approve C2**

Now, should you approve C1?

If you approve C1, your total approvals:

- C1: 1
- C2: 2

→ C2 wins → you get 5

No downside.

If you **don’t** approve C1, same outcome.

So you can choose either.

But to **maximize your expected payoff**, you can afford to **approve C1 or not** — doesn’t matter.

But the question is: **which contracts do you approve?**

We should **only approve ones that are beneficial**, but since C1 gives you no benefit and no harm, we can approve it.

But **approving C1 might be risky** — what if Player 2 **rejects C2**?

But no — **Player 2 will approve C2**, because they get 20 > 4.

So **safe**.

But suppose **Player 2 is irrational** — but we assume rationality.

So in rational play:

- Player 2 approves C2
- Player 2 does not approve C1
- You should approve C2
- You can approve C1 or not — no change

But to be safe, we can **not approve C1**, because it has no benefit.

But is there a strategic reason?

Wait — what if the contract selection is **random among those with max approvals**?

But here, C2 has 2, C1 has 1 → C2 wins.

So no randomness.

Thus, only C2 is selected.

So **approving C1 doesn't help**, but also doesn't hurt.

But **since the question asks for your approvals**, and you want to **maximize expected payoff**, you can **approve C2**, and optionally C1.

But to minimize risk, **do not approve C1**, because it might **lower** your expected payoff if it somehow caused a different outcome.

But **no** — it doesn't.

But one more thought: what if **both players approve only C2**, but you approve C1 — still C2 wins.

So no problem.

But is there a **downside to approving C1**?

Only if the contract somehow harms you — but it doesn’t.

In fact, approving C1 **does not change** the equilibrium.

So you are **indifferent**.

But to **maximize safety**, and since C1 is worse for you than C2, **do not approve C1**.

Final decision:

- Approve C2: YES → you get 5
- Approve C1: NO → no reason

So answer:
```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}
```

### ✅ Final Answer:

```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}
```

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's analyze the game and the proposed contracts step by step, from the perspective of **Player 2**, whose goal is to **maximize their total expected points**.

---

### 🔷 Step 1: Understand the base game (without contracts)

The game is a 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) — but remember: **I am Player 2**, so my payoffs are the second number in each tuple.

| My Action \ Opponent's Action | A0             | A1             |
|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **A0**                        | (10, 10)       | (2, 6)         |
| **A1**                        | (20, 0)        | (4, 4)         |

So from **my (Player 2)** perspective:
- If I play A0:
  - If opponent plays A0 → I get 10
  - If opponent plays A1 → I get 6
- If I play A1:
  - If opponent plays A0 → I get 0
  - If opponent plays A1 → I get 4

So I prefer A0 when opponent plays A0, but A1 when opponent plays A1.

But there's no dominant strategy — it depends on what the opponent does.

Let’s compute best responses.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that opponent plays A0
- $ 1 - p $ = probability opponent plays A1

Then my expected payoff:
- $ EU_{A0} = 10p + 6(1 - p) = 4p + 6 $
- $ EU_{A1} = 0p + 4(1 - p) = 4 - 4p $

I prefer A0 when:
$ 4p + 6 > 4 - 4p $
$ 8p > -2 $ → always true for $ p \geq 0 $

Wait: $ 4p + 6 > 4 - 4p $
→ $ 8p > -2 $
→ $ p > -0.25 $

But $ p \in [0,1] $, so this is **always true**.

So $ EU_{A0} > EU_{A1} $ for all $ p \in [0,1] $?

Wait, let's double-check:
- At $ p = 0 $: $ EU_{A0} = 6 $, $ EU_{A1} = 4 $ → A0 better
- At $ p = 1 $: $ EU_{A0} = 10 $, $ EU_{A1} = 0 $ → A0 better
- At $ p = 0.5 $: $ EU_{A0} = 4(0.5)+6 = 8 $, $ EU_{A1} = 4 - 2 = 2 $

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** from **Player 2’s perspective**?

Wait — that can’t be right. Let’s confirm:

Is A0 always better than A1 for Player 2?

Compare:
- $ EU_{A0} = 10p + 6(1-p) = 4p + 6 $
- $ EU_{A1} = 0p + 4(1-p) = 4 - 4p $

Set $ 4p + 6 > 4 - 4p $
→ $ 8p > -2 $ → always true.

So yes! **Player 2 strictly prefers A0 to A1 for any strategy the opponent uses.**

That means:
- **Player 2 should always play A0** in the base game (assuming rationality).
- The only rational outcome is both playing A0 → (10,10)
- But that depends on whether Player 1 is also rational.

Wait — let’s check **Player 1’s incentives**.

Player 1 payoffs:
- A0 vs A0: 10
- A1 vs A0: 20 → better
- A0 vs A1: 2
- A1 vs A1: 4

So Player 1's expected payoff:
- If they play A0: $ 10q + 2(1-q) = 8q + 2 $, where q = prob player 2 plays A0
- If they play A1: $ 20q + 4(1-q) = 16q + 4 $

Now compare:
- A1 better than A0 when: $ 16q + 4 > 8q + 2 $
→ $ 8q > -2 $ → again, true for all $ q \geq 0 $

Wait: At $ q = 0 $: A1 → 4, A0 → 2 → A1 better
At $ q = 1 $: A1 → 20, A0 → 10 → A1 better

So **Player 1 also strictly prefers A1 regardless of what Player 2 does?**

So:
- Player 1: A1 strictly dominates A0 → always plays A1
- Player 2: A0 strictly dominates A1 → always plays A0

So Nash equilibrium: (A1, A0) → (20, 0)

That means:
- Player 1 gets 20
- Player 2 gets 0

This is **bad for Player 2**.

So unless we change the incentives, Player 2 is stuck with 0.

---

### 🔷 Step 2: Introduce the contract system

We can now **agree on a payment contract** via approval voting.

The contract adds **additional payments** based on your action, paid by you or to you, **distributed equally among other players** (only one other player, so "equally" just means the whole amount is paid to the other player).

Let's analyze each contract.

---

### 🔷 Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)

> - If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So:
- If you play A0 → you **lose 1 point**
- If you play A1 → no effect

This applies to **both players**, so it affects the payoffs.

We need to compute new payoffs *from Player 2’s perspective*.

#### New payoffs (Player 2):

| Player 2 \ Opponent | A0 (P1 plays A0) | A1 (P1 plays A1) |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **A0**              | 10 - 1 = 9       | 6 - 1 = 5        |
| **A1**              | 0                | 4                |

Wait: Let's be careful.

The contract says: **If a player chooses A0, they pay 1 point to the other player**.

So:
- When Player 2 plays A0 → Player 2 **pays 1** → so their total is base payoff minus 1
- When Player 2 plays A1 → no effect

So the **updated payoffs for Player 2** are:
- (A0, A0): 10 - 1 = 9
- (A0, A1): 6 - 1 = 5
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A1, A1): 4

Player 1's payoffs are also affected:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → pays 1 to Player 2
- So Player 1: (A0, A0) → 10 - 1 = 9, (A0, A1) → 2 - 1 = 1
- (A1, A0): 20 (no charge for A1), (A1, A1): 4

But we care about **our own expected payoff**, so focus on Player 2.

So Player 2's incentives (after C1):
- $ EU_{A0} = 9p + 5(1 - p) = 4p + 5 $
- $ EU_{A1} = 0p + 4(1 - p) = 4 - 4p $

Compare:
When is $ 4p + 5 > 4 - 4p $?
→ $ 8p > -1 $ → always true.

So **A0 still better than A1 for Player 2**.

But now the **magnitudes are worse**:
- At p = 1: EU = 9 vs 0 → still good for A0
- But expected payoff is lower than before.

But **we are still incentivized to play A0**.

Now, Player 1’s incentives:

Player 1:
- Play A0: $ EU_{A0} = 9p + 1(1 - p) = 8p + 1 $
- Play A1: $ 20p + 4(1 - p) = 16p + 4 $

Compare:
A1 better when $ 16p + 4 > 8p + 1 $ → $ 8p > -3 $ → always true.

So **Player 1 still prefers A1**, no matter what.

So outcome: (A1, A0) → Player 2 gets 0.

Wait: But if Player 1 plays A1, and Player 2 plays A0 → the base payoff is (2,6), and then since Player 2 played A0 → they **pay 1 point** to Player 1 → so Player 2’s total is **6 - 1 = 5**, not 0?

Wait — **I messed up**.

Let’s clarify the **contract effect**:

> "If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players."

So:
- If **Player 2 plays A0**, then **Player 2 pays 1 point** to Player 1 → so Player 2 gets base payoff minus 1
- If **Player 1 plays A0**, then **Player 1 pays 1 point** to Player 2 → Player 2 gets +1

But Player 1 is playing A1 (because A1 dominates), so Player 1 pays nothing.

So:
- If outcome is (A1, A0): Player 1 plays A1 (no cost), Player 2 plays A0 → Player 2 pays 1 to Player 1 → Player 2's total = 6 - 1 = 5
- Base payoffs: (2,6) → but with contract: Player 2 pays 1 → so gets 5, Player 1 gets 2 + 1 = 3

Wait no:
The original payoff is:

(A1, A0): Player 2 gets 6 → now, because Player 2 played A0, they **must pay 1** → so final is **5**

Player 1 gets 2 → but Player 1 played A1 → no cost → so gets 2.

Wait — no! The **contract effect is on the player who plays A0**.

So:

- When Player 2 plays A0 → they pay 1 to the other player → so **Player 2 loses 1**, Player 1 gains 1
- If Player 1 plays A0 → Player 1 pays 1 → Player 2 gains 1

But Player 1 plays A1 → so no effect.

So in (A1, A0):
- Base: (2,6)
- Contract: Player 2 played A0 → so Player 2 pays 1 → so Player 2 gets 6 - 1 = 5
- Player 1 gets 2 (no effect)
→ Final: (2,5)

Wait, is that right? But the contract says "distributed equally among the other players".

Since only one other player, "equally" just means the full 1 goes to the other player.

So yes, Player 2 pays 1 → Player 1 gets +1.

So final:
- Player 1: 2 + 1 = 3
- Player 2: 6 - 1 = 5

But that’s inconsistent with earlier.

Wait — let’s re-express **Player 2’s total payoff** after contract.

### ✅ Correct way:
The **total payoff for a player** is:
> Base payoff + (adjustments from contract)

For Player 2:
- If they play A0 → **pay 1** → so **-1**
- If they play A1 → 0

Also:
- If **Player 1 plays A0** → Player 2 **receives 1**
- If Player 1 plays A1 → nothing

So in (A1, A0):
- Player 2 played A0 → -1
- Player 1 played A0 → +1
- Base: 6
→ Total: 6 + (-1) + (+1) = **6**

Wait — that can't be right.

But the **contract is applied per player based on their own action**, independently.

So the **payment is based solely on your own choice**, not the other’s.

So:
- If you play A0 → you **pay 1**, regardless of what the other does
- If you play A1 → nothing

And that payment is **given to the other player**

So:
In (A1, A0):
- Player 1 plays A1 → no payment → so gets base 2
- Player 2 plays A0 → pays 1 to Player 1 → so Player 2 gets base 6 - 1 = 5
- Player 1 gets base 2 + 1 (from Player 2) = 3

So final payoffs: (3,5)

Ah! I see — I had confusion earlier.

So for **Player 2**, when they play A0:
- They **lose 1 point** (paying to Player 1)
- So their total payoff is **base payoff minus 1**, **regardless** of who they’re playing against.

But wait — in (A0, A0), both players play A0 → both pay 1 → so:
- Player 2: base 10 - 1 = 9
- Player 1: base 10 - 1 = 9

But if Player 1 pays 1 to Player 2, and Player 2 pays 1 to Player 1, it's a net zero.

But the **contract says**: "If a player chooses A0, they pay 1 point, distributed equally among other players."

So each player who plays A0 pays 1 → so if both play A0, each pays 1 → each receives 1 → net zero.

So Player 2 gets base payoff **minus 1**, but **plus 1 if Player 1 plays A0**.

But **no**, the payment is **sent to other players**, so:

- If Player 2 plays A0 → Player 2 loses 1
- That 1 point goes to Player 1
- Whether Player 1 plays A0 or A1 doesn't affect **where** the money goes — it’s just paid to the other player.

So for Player 2:
- When they play A0 → **-1** (pay 1 to Player 1)
- When they play A1 → 0

When Player 1 plays A0 → **Player 2 gains 1**
When Player 1 plays A1 → 0

So **Player 2's total payoff = base payoff + (1 if P1 played A0) - (1 if P2 played A0)**

Yes, that’s accurate.

So:
- In (A0, A0): base = 10, +1 (P1 played A0), -1 (P2 played A0) → 10
- In (A0, A1): base = 6, +0 (P1 played A1), -1 (P2 played A0) → 5
- In (A1, A0): base = 2, +1 (P1 played A0), -1 (P2 played A0) → 2
- In (A1, A1): base = 4, +0, -1 → 3

Wait, no!
Player 2 plays A1 → pays nothing → -1 only if they play A0.

So in (A1, A0):
- P2 plays A1 → no payment
- P1 plays A0 → so P2 receives 1
- Base payoff: 2
→ Total: 2 + 1 = 3

In (A0, A0): P2 plays A0 → pays 1 → -1; P1 plays A0 → P2 receives 1 → +1 → net 0 → base 10 → total 10

In (A0, A1): P2 plays A0 → -1; P1 plays A1 → +0 → base 6 → total 5

In (A1, A1): P2 plays A1 → 0; P1 plays A1 → 0 → base 4 → total 4

So corrected Player 2 payoff matrix under C1:

| P2 \ P1 | A0         | A1         |
|---------|------------|------------|
| A0      | 10         | 5          |
| A1      | 3          | 4          |

Now, let’s see Player 2’s expected payoff.

Let $ p $ = P(P1 plays A0)

Then:
- $ EU_{A0} = 10p + 5(1-p) = 5p + 5 $
- $ EU_{A1} = 3p + 4(1-p) = -p + 4 $

Compare when A0 better:
$ 5p + 5 > -p + 4 $
→ $ 6p > -1 $ → always true

So **A0 still strictly dominates A1** for Player 2.

So Player 2 always plays A0.

Now, what does Player 1 do?

Player 1’s payoffs under C1:
- A0: gets base payoff + (1 if P2 plays A0) - (1 if P1 plays A0)
  - So: base = 10 if P2 plays A0, or 2 if P2 plays A1
  - But if P2 plays A0 → P1 gets +1 from contract
  - If P1 plays A0 → P1 pays 1
- So (A0, A0): 10 + 1 - 1 = 10
- (A0, A1): 2 + 0 - 1 = 1
- (A1, A0): 20 + 1 - 0 = 21
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4

So Player 1’s matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0         | A1         |
|---------|------------|------------|
| A0      | 10         | 1          |
| A1      | 21         | 4          |

Now, P1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 10 vs 21 → prefers A1
- If P2 plays A1 → 1 vs 4 → prefers A1

So **Player 1 always plays A1**.

So outcome: (A1, A0)

Player 2 plays A0 → gets 5 (as above)

So **under C1, Player 2 gets 5 points**

Previously, without contract: (A1, A0) → Player 2 gets 6 (base), but now:
- In (A1, A0): base = 2, P2 plays A0 → pays 1 → so gets 2 - 1 = 1? Wait — no!

Wait — we had a **mistake**.

In (A1, A0):
- Base payoff for Player 2: 6 (according to table)
- Player 2 plays A0 → so **pays 1** → so total: 6 - 1 = **5**

But that means:
- Without contract: (A1, A0) gives Player 2: 6
- With C1: Player 2 gets 5

So C1 **lowers Player 2's payoff** in that outcome — because even though they get the base 6, they pay 1.

So **C1 reduces Player 2’s payoff from 6 to 5** in the outcome (A1, A0)

But is that the only outcome? Yes — because Player 1 still plays A1, Player 2 plays A0.

So **C1 gives Player 2 5 points**

Previously, without contract, they would get 6.

So **C1 is worse** for Player 2.

So should **not approve** C1.

But wait — could there be a different outcome? Only if Player 1 wants to change.

But Player 1 still strictly prefers A1, so no.

Thus, under C1: Player 2 gets 5.

Previously: 6.

So C1 is **bad for Player 2** → **do not approve C1**

---

### 🔷 Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get +11 (from the other player)
- If you play A1 → 0

So for **Player 2**:
- If they play A0 → +11
- If they play A1 → 0
- Also: if Player 1 plays A0 → Player 1 pays 11 → Player 2 gets +11

But Player 2 only gets paid if they play A0 **or** if Player 1 plays A0? No.

The contract says: **If a player chooses A0, they receive 11 from the other player**

So:
- When **Player 2 plays A0** → gets +11
- When **Player 1 plays A0** → gets +11

So Player 2’s total payoff:
> base payoff + 11 * (1 if Player 2 played A0) + 11 * (1 if Player 1 played A0)

Same for Player 1.

So compute Player 2’s payoff matrix now:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 10 +11 +11 = 32 | 6 +11 +0 = 17 |
| A1     | 2 +0 +11 = 13 | 4 +0 +0 = 4 |

So:
- (A0, A0): 10 +11 (from self) +11 (from P1) = 32
- (A0, A1): 6 +11 = 17 (P2 played A0, P1 played A1 → only +11 from self)
- (A1, A0): 2 +11 = 13 (P1 played A0 → +11, P2 played A1 → 0 from self)
- (A1, A1): 4

Now, Player 2’s expected payoff:
- $ EU_{A0} = 32p + 17(1-p) = 15p + 17 $
- $ EU_{A1} = 13p + 4(1-p) = 9p + 4 $

Compare: Is A0 better?
$ 15p + 17 > 9p + 4 $ → $ 6p > -13 $ → always true.

So **A0 still dominates A1** for Player 2 → always plays A0.

Now check Player 1:
Player 1’s payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 10 +11 (from self) +11 (from P2) = 32
- (A0, A1): 2 +11 (from self) +0 (P2 played A1) = 13
- (A1, A0): 20 +0 (from self) +11 (P2 played A0) = 31
- (A1, A1): 4

So P1 matrix:
| P1 \ P2 | A0      | A1      |
|--------|---------|---------|
| A0     | 32      | 13      |
| A1     | 31      | 4       |

Now, best responses:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 32 vs 31 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1 → 13 vs 4 → prefers A0

So **Player 1 also always plays A0**

Therefore, outcome is (A0, A0) → both play A0.

Then Player 2 gets: base 10 +11 (from self playing A0) +11 (from P1 playing A0) = **32**

This is **much better** than the base game (10) and better than C1 (5) or base outcome (6).

So under C2:
- Player 2 gets **32 points**
- And both players are incentivized to play A0
- The strategy is stable

Therefore, **C2 is excellent for Player 2**

### 🔷 Summary

- **C1**: Proposed by Player 1 → forces Player 2 to pay 1 when playing A0 → reduces their payoff from 6 to 5 in the outcome → **bad for Player 2**
- **C2**: Proposed by Player 2 → gives +11 for playing A0 → makes A0 even more attractive → leads to (A0,A0) → Player 2 gets 32 → **very good**

So Player 2 should:
- **Reject C1**
- **Approve C2**

### ✅ Final Answer:

```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

**Original Payoff Matrix (Me, Other):**
- (A0, A0): (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6, 2)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

**Finding the Nash Equilibrium:**

For the other player:
- If I play A0: They get 10 from A0 or 20 from A1 → A1 is better
- If I play A1: They get 2 from A0 or 4 from A1 → A1 is better
- **A1 strictly dominates A0 for the other player**

Given the other player will play A1:
- My payoff from A0: 0 points
- My payoff from A1: 4 points
- **I should play A1**

**Nash Equilibrium without contract: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

**Contract effects:**
- Playing A0: Receive +3 points from the other player
- Playing A1: Pay -13 points to the other player

**Modified Payoff Matrix (Me, Other):**
- (A0, A0): (10+3-3, 10+3-3) = (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): (0+3+13, 20-13-3) = (16, 4)
- (A1, A0): (6-13+3, 2+13-3) = (-4, 12)
- (A1, A1): (4-13+13, 4-13+13) = (4, 4)

**Finding the Nash Equilibrium:**

For me:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 10, A1 gives -4 → A0 is better
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 16, A1 gives 4 → A0 is better
- **A0 strictly dominates A1 for me**

For the other player:
- If I play A0: They get 10 from A0 or 4 from A1 → A0 is better
- If I play A1: They get 12 from A0 or 4 from A1 → A0 is better
- **A0 strictly dominates A1 for the other player**

**Nash Equilibrium with contract: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** I expect 4 points
- **With contract:** I expect 10 points

The contract transforms the game so that cooperation (A0, A0) becomes the dominant strategy for both players, increasing my payoff by 6 points.

**Conclusion:** I should sign the contract.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Understand the Basic Game (Without Contract)

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:

|           | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0 | 10             | 2              |
| I play A1 | 20             | 4              |

**My dominant strategy without contract:** A1 (since 20 > 10 and 4 > 2)

For Player 1, analyzing their best responses:
- If I play A0: They prefer A0 (gets 10 vs 6)
- If I play A1: They prefer A1 (gets 4 vs 0)

Since I have dominant strategy A1, rational Player 1 will play A1.

**Expected outcome without contract:** (A1, A1) → **I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Calculate Payoffs With the Contract

Contract terms:
- Choose A0: receive +3 points from the other player
- Choose A1: pay -13 points to the other player

Net contract adjustments for my payoffs:
- (A0, A0): +3 - 3 = 0
- (A1, A0): -13 - 3 = -16
- (A0, A1): +3 + 13 = +16
- (A1, A1): -13 + 13 = 0

Modified payoff matrix for me:

|           | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0 | 10 + 0 = **10**    | 2 + 16 = **18**    |
| I play A1 | 20 - 16 = **4**    | 4 + 0 = **4**      |

## Step 3: Identify My Dominant Strategy With Contract

**With contract, A0 strictly dominates A1:**
- When other plays A0: 10 > 4
- When other plays A1: 18 > 4

Player 1 would also have A0 as their dominant strategy with the contract.

**Expected outcome with contract:** (A0, A0) → **I get 10 points**

## Step 4: Compare Outcomes

- Without contract: 4 points
- With contract: 10 points

**Conclusion:** The contract transforms the game from a prisoner's dilemma into one where cooperation (A0) is dominant. I receive 10 points instead of 4 points.

response:
Looking at this problem, I need to analyze what happens under each contract and determine which maximizes my expected payoff.

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

Let me write out the payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):

```
              Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0      10, 10          2, 6
Player 2: A1      20, 0           4, 4
```

In the base game without contracts:
- A1 is my dominant strategy (20 > 10 when P1 plays A0; 4 > 2 when P1 plays A1)
- Given I play A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (4 > 0)
- **Equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

Contract 1: Pay 1 point for choosing A0; no payment for A1

Modified payoffs:
```
              Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0      10, 10          1, 7
Player 2: A1      21, -1          4, 4
```

- A1 is still my dominant strategy (21 > 10; 4 > 1)
- Given I play A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (4 > -1)
- **Equilibrium: (A1, A1) → I get 4 points**

Contract 1 doesn't change the equilibrium outcome!

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

Contract 2: Receive 3 points for choosing A0; pay 13 points for choosing A1

Modified payoffs:
```
              Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0      10, 10         18, -10
Player 2: A1     -10, 30          4, 4
```

- A0 is now my dominant strategy! (10 > -10; 18 > 4)
- A0 is also Player 1's dominant strategy (10 > -10; 30 > 4)
- **Equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get 10 points**

Contract 2 changes the game to make mutual cooperation (A0, A0) the dominant strategy equilibrium!

## Step 4: Strategic Voting Analysis

Comparing outcomes:
- No contract or C1: 4 points
- C2: 10 points

I clearly prefer C2. What about Player 1? They also get 10 under C2 versus 4 under C1 or no contract, so they should also prefer C2.

If I approve only C2:
- If P1 also approves C2: C2 wins → I get 10 ✓
- If P1 approves only C1: Tie (1-1), random selection → Expected value = 7
- If P1 approves both: C2 has more approvals → C2 wins → I get 10 ✓

If I approve both C1 and C2:
- This could lead to C1 winning if P1 only approves C1
- This gives me 4 instead of the 7 I'd get from a tie

**Conclusion: Approving only C2 is optimal**

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are Player 1. The payoff matrix for the base game is:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **P1: A1** | (6, 2)   | (4, 4)   |

We need to analyze what happens in equilibrium, and then see how contracts could change incentives.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Base Game – Best Responses**

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium (NE).

Let’s suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability **q**, A1 with probability **1−q**.

Player 1’s expected payoff:

- If P1 plays A0:  
  `EU(A0) = q * 10 + (1−q) * 0 = 10q`

- If P1 plays A1:  
  `EU(A1) = q * 6 + (1−q) * 4 = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4`

Set equal to find indifference point:
```
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5
```

So Player 1 is indifferent when q = 0.5.

- If q > 0.5, A0 is better
- If q < 0.5, A1 is better

Now from Player 2’s perspective:

Let P1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1−p

Player 2’s payoffs:

- A0: p * 10 + (1−p) * 2 = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- A1: p * 20 + (1−p) * 4 = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal:
```
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → impossible
```

So no indifference – we check boundaries.

- If p = 0 (P1 plays A1):  
  P2’s payoff: A0 → 2, A1 → 4 → prefers A1
- If p = 1 (P1 plays A0):  
  P2’s payoff: A0 → 10, A1 → 20 → prefers A1

So **P2 always prefers A1**, regardless of P1.

Thus, **P2’s dominant strategy is A1**.

Therefore, in Nash equilibrium, P2 plays A1 with probability 1.

Now, given that P2 always plays A1, what should P1 do?

- If P1 plays A0: gets 0
- If P1 plays A1: gets 4

So P1 prefers A1 → gets 4 > 0

**Nash Equilibrium: (A1, A1)** → payoffs: (4, 4)

But wait — we can check if there are other equilibria?

Suppose P1 plays A0 with some probability. But P2 always prefers A1, so even if P1 mixes, P2 still plays A1.

So yes, **the only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**.

However, **(A0, A0)** gives 10 each — better for both — but unstable because P2 can deviate to A1 for 20.

So this is a prisoner’s dilemma-like game.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

Each contract defines **additional payments** for each action, which are **transferred between players**.

The contract is only active if **approved by both players** (via approval voting), and the **winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from the most-approved ones**.

You are to decide which contracts you approve, **with the goal of maximizing your own expected total points** over time.

Note: You are **only deciding whether to approve**, not the final contract — it's random among most-approved ones.

You want to **maximize your expected total points**, considering that:

- The contract may change behavior (players might change their strategies)
- The contract itself may alter payoffs
- You choose which contracts to **approve**; the final contract is selected among those with the most approvals.

So your strategy should be: **approve contracts that either (a) lead to better outcomes in the resulting game, or (b) are safe and don’t harm your payoff, and (c) are likely to be selected (if you vote for many, they may not win if others vote for others).**

But since the winning contract is **uniform random among those with the *maximum* number of approvals**, the key is to **maximize your own payoff under the contracts that are likely to be selected**.

So you need to simulate:

- What happens if you approve **C1**? What if you don’t?
- What happens if you approve **C2**? What if you don’t?
- Then compute your expected payoff under the final contract(s) that would be selected.

But since you don't know what the other player will do, you must assume they are rational and will approve contracts that benefit them.

So we must do **game-theoretic reasoning with contracts**.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**

> **C1:**  
> - If a player chooses A0, they pay 1 point, distributed equally among the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:  
- If you play A0 → you **lose 1 point**, and the **other player gains 1 point** (because "distributed equally among the other players" — only 1 other player, so they get 1).
- If you play A1 → nothing happens.

Thus, **your payoff is reduced by 1 if you choose A0**.

So for you (Player 1), the **effective payoff** from playing A0 is **reduced by 1**.

Similarly, if the other player chooses A0, they lose 1, you gain 1.

So, let’s update the game matrix with C1 in effect.

**Payoffs when C1 is active (Player 1’s perspective):**

|           | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0** | (10−1, 10+1) = (9, 11) | (0−1, 20+1) = (-1, 21) |
| **P1: A1** | (6, 2)        | (4, 4)        |

Wait — **but the payment is made by the player who chooses A0**, so it's **syntactically symmetric**, but outcomes depend on who chooses what.

Actually, the contract affects **each player individually**.

So when:
- You play A0 → you **pay 1**, so your **own** payoff decreases by 1
- The other player, if they play A0, pays 1, so **their** payoff decreases by 1, but **you** get +1

So yes, the payoff matrix **from P1’s view** is:

|           | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0** | 10 − 1 = 9    | 0 − 1 = −1    |
| **P1: A1** | 6             | 4             |

And P2's payoffs (for information):

|           | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0** | 10 + 1 = 11   | 20 + 1 = 21   |
| **P1: A1** | 2             | 4             |

Now, let’s analyze best responses under C1.

**Player 2’s strategy:**

P2’s payoffs (P2 wants to maximize their own payoff):

- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets: A0: 11, A1: 21 → chooses **A1**
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets: A0: 2, A1: 4 → chooses **A1**

So **P2 still always prefers A1** (dominant strategy)

Then, if P2 plays A1, P1’s choices:

- A0: -1
- A1: 4 → better

So P1 prefers A1 → gives 4 > −1

So again, **equilibrium is (A1, A1)** → payoffs: (4, 4)

But wait — in this case, **both choose A1**, so **no one pays anything** → so actual payoff is (4,4)

But **could the contract lead to better outcomes?**

Only if P2 would choose A0 → but they won’t, because:
- If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 2 from A0, 4 from A1 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A0, P2 gets 11 from A0, 21 from A1 → still prefers A1

So P2 never plays A0 → so **A0 is never played under C1**

Thus, no one ever pays the 1 point.

So **C1 has no effect** — players still only play A1, and get 4 each.

**But C1 was proposed by Player 1**, and we're evaluating whether **Player 1** approves it.

So if C1 is used, and no one plays A0, the contract is ineffective → everyone gets 4.

Same as without contract.

But suppose **Player 1 might consider if C1 discourages the other from playing A0** — but in reality, P2 **already won’t play A0** — so no change.

So **C1 does nothing** when played in equilibrium.

However, what if **P2 is irrational**? But we assume rationality.

Thus, **C1 has no effect on outcome**.

But **C1 harms P1**: if P1 ever played A0, they’d lose 1 point. But since P1 won’t play A0 anyway, it’s irrelevant.

So **C1 is harmless for P1 → but doesn’t help either**.

But since it’s proposed by P1, and P1 **might** be tempted to approve it to "discourage" A0, but it **doesn’t change behavior**, so no benefit.

But **what if — hypothetically — P1 could enforce a better outcome?**

Wait: suppose we look at **P2’s incentives**.

Under C1, if P2 plays A0, they pay 1 → so P2's payoff is lower → worse.

P2 **already doesn’t want to play A0**, so this strengthens their disincentive.

But still, they wouldn’t play A0 anyway.

So C1 **does nothing**.

Thus, **C1 is indifferent — no effect on outcome**.

But P1 **proposes it**, so if P1 votes for it, it only has one approval.

Now, **should P1 approve C1?**

- It doesn’t hurt P1 (no change in payoff, because A0 is never played).
- But it **doesn’t help** P1 either.
- But if P1 doesn’t approve it, it cannot be selected.

But **C1 is proposed by P1**, so P1 will probably approve it — to have a chance for it to be selected.

But does it improve P1’s **expected payoff**?

No. It has **no effect**.

So **approving C1 gives no benefit**, but doesn’t hurt.

But since **the final contract is selected randomly among most-approved**, **if P1 approves C1, and P2 doesn’t**, then C1 has one approval → not the maximum (unless all others have 0).

But if P2 also approves it, then two approvals → possibly wins.

But what does **P2** get from C1?

From P2’s perspective:

- Playing A0: they lose 1 → bad
- Playing A1: no cost

So P2 is **against C1**, because:
- It makes them worse off if they play A0
- But they **never play A0** → so no loss

But **if they play A0**, they lose more

But **they never do**, so **P2 gains nothing, loses nothing** → so P2 **might be indifferent**?

Wait — P2’s **current** payoff in (A1, A1) is 4.

Under C1, same → 4.

But if **P1 deviates** to A0, P2 gets 21 → but holds, P2 **still won’t play A0**, because even though P1 plays A0, P2 **prefers A1** (21 > 11)

So P2 is **strictly better** choosing A1 regardless.

So **P2 is unaffected** by C1.

Thus, **P2 has no incentive to approve C1**.

Also, **C1 harms P1** in the sense that if they ever chose A0, they’d pay 1 → but since they never do, it doesn’t matter.

But **P1 has no reason to approve C1**, because:
- It doesn’t increase their payoff
- It might make it **worse** if P1 ever deviates, but they don’t

But approval is not about punishing deviation — it’s about making the game better.

But no improvement.

Therefore, **P1 should not approve C1** — it’s useless.

But wait — could **C1 lead to better cooperation?**

Only if P2 would play A0 for a higher payoff.

But with C1, **P2's payoff from A0 is reduced** → so even less likely.

So C1 makes cooperation **less likely**, not more.

Thus, **C1 is counterproductive**.

Therefore, **P1 should NOT approve C1**.

Even though P1 proposed it.

Because:
- Proponent is self-interested.
- C1 does nothing good, may hurt (if you ever want to play A0).
- But in equilibrium, you don’t.

So **don’t approve C1**.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**

> **C2:**  
> - If a player chooses A0, they **receive an additional payment of 5 points**, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:
- If you choose A0 → you **gain 5 points**
- The other player **loses 5 points** (since payment is drawn from them)

So for P1, if you choose A0 → you get +5
If P1 chooses A1 → no change

For P2, if they choose A0 → they get +5
If P2 chooses A1 → no change

So let’s now update the game matrix under C2.

**From P1’s perspective (Player 1):**

|           | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0** | (10 + 5, 10 − 5) = (15, 5) | (0 + 5, 20 − 5) = (5, 15) |
| **P1: A1** | (6, 2)        | (4, 4)        |

But wait: the **payment is from the other players**.

So if **P1 chooses A0**, P1 gains 5 → so payoff increases by 5.

If **P2 chooses A0**, P2 gains 5, so **P1 loses 5** (because the 5 comes from the other player).

So yes, that’s correct.

So under C2:

**P1’s payoffs:**
- A0 vs A0: 10 + 5 = 15 (P1 gains 5)
- A0 vs A1: 0 + 5 = 5 (P1 gains 5)
- A1 vs A0: 6 − 5 = 1 (P2 plays A0 → P1 loses 5)
- A1 vs A1: 4

Wait — **this is critical**: the additional payoff to a player **only applies when they themselves choose A0**.

But **the cost to the other player only when the other player chooses A0**.

So:

- P1 gets +5 **if P1 chooses A0**, no matter what P2 does.
- P1 loses 5 **if P2 chooses A0**, no matter what P1 does.

So P1's total payoff under C2 = original payoff - 5*(1 if P2 plays A0) + 5*(1 if P1 plays A0)

Similarly for P2.

So **P1’s effective payoff:**
- A0, P2 A0: 10 + 5 (from self) - 5 (from P2) = 10
- A0, P2 A1: 0 + 5 (self) - 0 = 5
- A1, P2 A0: 6 + 0 (no self) - 5 (P2) = 1
- A1, P2 A1: 4 + 0 - 0 = 4

Similarly, P2’s payoff:
- A0, P1 A0: 10 + 5 - 5 = 10
- A0, P1 A1: 2 + 5 - 0 = 7
- A1, P1 A0: 20 + 0 - 5 = 15
- A1, P1 A1: 4

Wait — this is different.

Actually: the **payment is for the player choosing A0**, and **drawn from the other player**.

So:
- If P1 chooses A0 → P1 gains 5 → so P1’s payoff increases by 5, P2’s decreases by 5
- If P2 chooses A0 → P2 gains 5 → P2’s payoff increases by 5, P1’s decreases by 5

So yes, the payoff matrix **for Player 1** under C2:

|           | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0** | 10 + 5 = 15   | 0 + 5 = 5     |
| **P1: A1** | 6 − 5 = 1     | 4             |

Similarly, for P2:
|           | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0** | 10 + 5 = 15   | 20 + 5 = 25   |
| **P1: A1** | 2 + 5 = 7     | 4             |

But **P1’s own payoff** is:
- A0: 15 (if P2 A0), 5 (if P2 A1)
- A1: 1 (if P2 A0), 4 (if P2 A1)

Now, let’s compute **best responses**.

**Player 1 (P1)**:

- If P2 plays A0 (prob q):
  - A0: 15
  - A1: 1 → so P1 prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1 (prob 1−q):
  - A0: 5
  - A1: 4 → so P1 prefers A0

So no matter what P2 does, **P1 prefers A0** → **A0 is weakly dominant**.

**Player 2 (P2)**:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2: A0 → 15, A1 → 25 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2: A0 → 7, A1 → 4 → prefers A0

So P2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → A1
- If P1 plays A1 → A0

Now, **equilibrium**:

P1 always plays A0.

Then P2 best response is A1.

Then P1 plays A0 (since still best).

So **Nash equilibrium: (A0, A1)**

Payoffs:
- P1: 5
- P2: 25

But wait — is this the only equilibrium?

Yes — because P1 always prefers A0.

So regardless of P2’s action, P1 chooses A0.

Then P2’s best response is A1.

So only equilibrium: (A0, A1)

Payoffs: **P1: 5**, **P2: 25**

Compare to original game: (A1, A1) → 4 each

So under C2, **P1 gets 5 > 4** → **better for P1**

P2 gets 25 → much better → P2 will love C2.

But **is this stable?**

Yes.

So **if C2 is in effect**, the outcome becomes (A0, A1), P1 gets 5.

Compared to original 4 → **gain of 1 point**

So **C2 benefits P1**

Now, does it help P2? Yes — P2 gets 25 instead of 4 → huge gain.

But **P2 proposed C2**, so of course.

But **does P2 want to approve it?**

Yes — they get **25** instead of **4** → big gain.

But will **P2 approve C2**?

Yes — **definitely**, because it gives them 25.

But **what if C2 is applied?**

Then outcome is (A0, A1), P2 gets 25.

So **P2 should approve C2**

Now, **should P1 approve C2?**

Yes — **P1 gets 5**, which is **better than 4**.

So **P1 benefits**.

So **both players benefit** from C2.

- P1: 5 > 4 → good
- P2: 25 > 4 → great

So **C2 is Pareto improving**.

Moreover, **P1 should approve C2**.

But wait — what if **P2 doesn’t approve**, and C2 isn’t selected?

But we’re only deciding whether **you (P1)** approve.

The winning contract is **any** with maximum approvals.

So if **P1 approves C2**, and **P2 approves C2**, then C2 has 2 approvals.

C1 has only P1’s approval (assuming P1 doesn’t approve C1).

So C2 would win.

Then you get 5.

If C2 is **not approved**, then the base game is played → (A1,A1) → you get 4.

So **by approving C2, you have a chance to get 5** — better than 4.

And P2 will **also approve C2**, because they get 25.

Therefore, **C2 will be selected** if both approve.

So **approve C2**

Now, back to C1.

C1: proposed by P1, harms P2 (makes them worse if they play A0), but P2 never plays A0, so P2 gains nothing, loses nothing → **P2 will not approve C1**, because it doesn’t help and P2 is indifferent.

But P1 might want to approve C1 to "force" cooperation? But as we saw, C1 **doesn't work** — it doesn’t lead to (A0,A0), because:

- Under C1, if P2 plays A0, P2 loses 1 → less incentive.
- But P2 already doesn’t play A0.

So **C1 is ineffective** and **C2 is superior**.

So P1 should only approve **C2**.

Now, should P1 approve **C1**?

- If P1 approves C1, and doesn’t approve C2, then C1 has 1 (P1’s vote), C2 has 0 → C1 wins → you get 4.
- If P1 approves C2, and P2 approves C2, C2 wins → you get 5.
- If P1 only approves C1 → get 4
- If P1 approves C2 → get 5

So **better to approve C2**

Moreover, **C1 is worse** than not having a contract.

So **do not approve C1**

But **C1 is proposed by P1**, so P1 might approve it, but **it harms no one**, but gives nothing.

But since you're maximizing your **own** points, approve only contracts that **benefit you**.

C2 benefits you (5 > 4)

C1 gives **no benefit** - outcome same as base game.

Therefore, **only approve C2**

But what if P2 does not approve C2?

Then C2 has only one approval (P1), C1 has (if P1 approves) or zero.

So C2 wins with 1 approval.

If P2 does not approve C2, they are not voting for it, so if only P1 votes for C2, C2 has 1.

If P1 also votes for C1, C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → both have max (1) → then **uniform random** between them.

Then **50% chance** of C2 (you get 5), 50% chance of C1 (you get 4)

So **expected payoff: 0.5×5 + 0.5×4 = 4.5**

But if you **only approve C2**, and P2 disapproves C2, then C2 has 1 approval, C1 has 0 → C2 wins → you get 5.

Wait — **C2 wins with 1 approval** → no tie.

So if you approve C2, and P2 does **not** approve C2, then only C2 has approval → so it wins → you get 5.

But if you approve **only C1**, and P2 does not approve C2, then C1 has 1 approval → wins → you get 4.

So better to approve C2.

But what if P2 **does** approve C2?

Then C2 has 2 approvals.

C1: only P1 - if you approve it → 1 approval → C2 wins.

So **C2 wins** no matter.

Thus, **if you approve C2**, whether P2 approves it or not, **C2 wins** (if P2 approves, gets 2 approvals; if not, C2 has 1, others 0 or 1).

Unless **P2 approves C1**, but P2 won’t — because C1 harms them.

P2’s original payoff is 4.

Under C1: they play A1 → get 4 → same.

But if they play A0 → lose 1 → worse.

So they **don’t gain** from C1, so **they won’t approve C1**.

Thus, **C1 will have at most 1 approval** (from P1).

C2 will have at least 1 (from P2), and possibly 2 (if P1 approves it).

So **C2 will have at least as many approvals as C1**.

Thus, **if P1 approves C2**, C2 wins → **you get 5**

If P1 does **not** approve C2, then C2 has 1 (P2), C1 has 1 (P1) → both have 1 → **random**, so you get random 50% chance of C2 (5) and 50% of C1 (4) → expected 4.5

But **4.5 < 5**, so **you are better off approving C2**

Even if P2 doesn’t approve C2, if you approve C2, C2 wins → you get 5

If you **don’t** approve C2, C2 has 1 (P2), C1 has 1 → tie → random → 4.5 expected

So **dear God, even worse if you don’t approve C2**

Therefore, **you should approve C2**

And **you should NOT approve C1** — it would only hurt you.

Because:
- If you approve C1 and C2 → C2 has 2, C1 has 2 → tie → random → expected payoff: 0.5×5 + 0.5×4 = 4.5 < 5

- If you approve only C2 → C2 wins → 5

- If you approve only C1 → C1 wins → 4

- If you approve neither: C2 has 1 (P2), C1 has 0 → C2 wins → 5

So **maximum payoff is 5**, and you can **attain it** by **approving C2**, regardless.

And if you approve C1, you risk **lowering your expected payoff** due to random selection in tie.

Thus, **optimal to approve only C2**

---

### **Final Decision:**

- Approve C2? **Yes** → because it gives you 5, better than 4.
- Approve C1? **No** → because it gives you nothing, and increases risk of tie → lowers expected payoff.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff) is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **P1: A1**    | (6, 2)  | (4, 4)  |

We are Player 1.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the contract**

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+5 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

This means:
- If **you** choose A0, you get **+5 points**, and **Player 2 loses 5 points** (since the money is drawn from the other player).
- If **Player 2** chooses A0, they get +5, and you lose 5.
- If you choose A1, nothing changes.
- If Player 2 chooses A1, nothing changes.

> **Important note**: The contract is only active **if both players sign it**. Since we are deciding whether to sign, we must assume that Player 2 has already proposed it (and presumably signed), but we are deciding whether to accept.

So, **if we sign**, the contract becomes active and modifies the payoffs **depending on who chooses what**.

---

### **Step 3: Compute new payoffs if the contract is signed**

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix** assuming **both players sign the contract**.

We’ll calculate the **total payoff for Player 1** in each outcome.

#### Case 1: P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A0
- Base payoff: (10, 10)
- P1 chooses A0 → gets +5
- P2 chooses A0 → loses 5 (so Player 1 gains 5 from this)
- But wait: who gets the +5? The contract says: "they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players."

> "Drawn equally from the other players" → since there are two players, each contributes half?

Wait: "drawn equally from the other players" — this is ambiguous.

Let’s parse carefully.

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

This means:
- The **+5** to the A0 player is taken **from the other player**.
- But "drawn equally from the other players" — if there is only one other player, then the entire 5 is taken from that player.

So it's not shared. It's taken entirely from the other player.

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +5, **Player 2 loses 5**.
- If **Player 2** chooses A0 → they get +5, **you lose 5**.

Therefore, the net effect is that **each A0 choice results in a transfer of 5 from the other player to the A0 player**.

So we can model it as a **transfer of 5 points from the non-A0 player to the A0 player**, but only **if** that player chose A0.

So, let’s recalculate payoffs:

---

#### New Payoff Matrix (with contract in effect, both signed):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2)        | A1 (P2)        |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (10 + 5, 10 - 5) = (15, 5) | (0 - 5, 20 + 5) = (-5, 25) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (6 - 5, 2 + 5) = (1, 7) | (4, 4) |

Wait! Let's carefully re-express.

When P1 chooses A0:
- P1 gets +5
- P2 **loses 5** (since P1's A0 "draws 5 from the other player")

When P2 chooses A0:
- P2 gets +5
- P1 **loses 5**

So both effects happen **simultaneously**.

So:

1. **P1: A0, P2: A0**
   - Base: (10, 10)
   - P1 chooses A0 → +5
   - P2 chooses A0 → P1 loses 5 (since P2 gains 5 from P1)
   - Net: P1 = 10 + 5 - 5 = 10
   - P2 = 10 - 5 + 5 = 10

Interesting! The transfer cancels.

Wait: P1 gets +5 (for choosing A0), but P2 chooses A0 → so P1 **loses 5** to P2.

So P1's total: 10 + 5 (from own choice) - 5 (paid to P2) = **10**

P2: 10 (base) - 5 (paid to P1) + 5 (from own choice) = **10**

So overall: (10, 10)

2. **P1: A0, P2: A1**
   - Base: (0, 20)
   - P1 chooses A0 → gets +5
   - P2 chooses A1 → no effect, so P1 doesn't lose money
   - So P1: 0 + 5 = **5**
   - P2: 20 + 0 = **20**

Wait — but if P2 chooses A1, **they don't get** the +5, and **they are not penalized**.

So P1 gets +5, no cost.

So (5, 20)

3. **P1: A1, P2: A0**
   - Base: (6, 2)
   - P1 chooses A1 → no effect
   - P2 chooses A0 → gets +5, so P1 **loses 5**
   - So P1: 6 - 5 = **1**
   - P2: 2 + 5 = **7**

4. **P1: A1, P2: A1**
   - Base: (4, 4)
   - Both choose A1 → no transfers
   - So (4, 4)

So final **new payoff matrix (with contract)**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------|----|----|
| **A0** | (10, 10) | (5, 20) |
| **A1** | (1, 7)  | (4, 4) |

Wait — that's interesting. The contract **only affects outcomes where players choose different actions?** Not quite — in A0,A0, the 5 was gained and lost, so it cancels. Only in asymmetric cases do we see shifts.

Let me verify again:

- (A0, A0): P1 gets +5, P2 gets +5 → but P2's +5 comes from P1, and P1's +5 comes from P2? No — the contract says: "drawn equally from the other players".

But "equally from the other players" — if both choose A0, then each has the other as the only other player, so each takes 5 from the other? That would require mutual transfer.

But then net: each gets +5 and loses 5 → net zero.

So yes: in (A0, A0), net effect is zero change.

In (A0, A1): P1 chooses A0 → gets +5, P2 chooses A1 → no change, so P1 gains only +5, P2 unchanged.

But P2 doesn't get the +5 (because chose A1), so no transfer from P1 to P2.

So P1: 0 + 5 = 5

P2: 20

Similarly, in (A1, A0): P2 chooses A0 → gets +5 → so P1 loses 5 (to P2)

P1 chooses A1 → no gain

So P1: 6 - 5 = 1

P2: 2 + 5 = 7

In (A1, A1): no effect → (4,4)

So confirmed.

So **new payoff matrix**:

|           | P2: A0        | P2: A1        |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0** | (10, 10)      | (5, 20)       |
| **P1: A1** | (1, 7)        | (4, 4)        |

---

### **Step 4: Analyze strategic implications**

We are Player 1. We want to **maximize our expected payoff**, assuming Player 2 is rational (also optimizing).

We must decide whether to **sign** the contract.

But note: **if we don’t sign, the contract does not apply**, so the original game holds.

So we must compare:
- **Expected payoff if we sign** (and Player 2 signs — assumed)
- **Expected payoff if we don’t sign**

We must consider what Player 2 will do in each case.

But note: **Player 2 proposed the contract**, so they likely believe it benefits them. But we must evaluate whether it benefits *us*.

So we compare two scenarios:

---

### **Scenario 1: We do NOT sign the contract**

Then the game remains **standard payoff matrix**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0     | A1     |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **A0**   | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **A1**   | (6, 2)  | (4, 4)  |

We analyze this game.

This is a **coordination game with conflict**.

First, check for dominant strategies.

For Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - A0: 10
  - A1: 6 → better to play A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - A0: 0
  - A1: 4 → better to play A1

No dominant strategy.

Similarly for P2:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - A0: 10
  - A1: 20 → better to play A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - A0: 2
  - A1: 4 → better to play A1

So **Player 2 has a dominant strategy: A1**!

Because regardless of P1's action, P2 gets more by choosing A1:
- Against A0: 20 > 10
- Against A1: 4 > 2

So P2 will play A1.

Then, given that P2 plays A1, Player 1’s best response:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4 → choose A1

So **Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1)** → payoff (4, 4)

This is the **only** rational outcome (since P2 has a dominant strategy).

So **if we do not sign**, expected payoff for us is **4**.

---

### **Scenario 2: We DO sign the contract**

Now the game has the **new payoff matrix**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0        | A1        |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**   | (10, 10)  | (5, 20)   |
| **A1**   | (1, 7)    | (4, 4)    |

Now, what is Player 2’s best response?

Check if Player 2 still has a dominant strategy.

For P2:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - A0: 10
  - A1: 20 → better to play A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - A0: 7
  - A1: 4 → better to play A0

So now **no dominant strategy**!

- When P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A1
- When P1 plays A1, P2 prefers A0

So P2 is **indifferent** unless they have beliefs about P1.

Now, what will **P2 do**?

They are rational and want to maximize their own payoff.

But we must consider our own decision: will we sign?

Let’s suppose we sign. Then P2 will respond optimally.

But we need to predict P2’s behavior.

Let’s find the **Nash equilibria** of the new game.

Possible pure strategy Nash equilibria:

1. (A0, A1): P1: 5, P2: 20
   - P1: If P2 plays A1, is A0 best? A0 gives 5, A1 gives 4 → yes, A0 better
   - P2: If P1 plays A0, A1 gives 20 > 10 → yes
   - So (A0, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

2. (A1, A0): P1: 1, P2: 7
   - P1: If P2 plays A0, A0 gives 10, A1 gives 1 → A0 better → so P1 would want to deviate
   - So not equilibrium.

3. (A0, A0): P1: 10, P2: 10
   - P2: If P1 plays A0, A1 gives 20 > 10 → so P2 wants to deviate
   - Not equilibrium.

4. (A1, A1): P1: 4, P2: 4
   - P2: If P1 plays A1, A0 gives 7 > 4 → wants to deviate
   - Not equilibrium.

So only **pure strategy NE** is **(A0, A1)** → payout (5, 20)

But what about mixed strategies?

Let’s suppose we mix: let P1 play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p)

P2’s expected payoff:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - E[P2] = p * 10 + (1-p) * 7 = 10p + 7 - 7p = 3p + 7

- If P2 plays A1:
  - E[P2] = p * 20 + (1-p) * 4 = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4

Set equal to find indifference:

3p + 7 = 16p + 4  
7 - 4 = 16p - 3p  
3 = 13p  
p = 3/13 ≈ 0.23

So if P1 plays A0 with probability 3/13, P2 is indifferent.

But P2's best response: if 3p + 7 > 16p + 4 → p < 3/13 → then A0 better  
if p > 3/13 → A1 better

So best response is:
- If p < 3/13 → P2 plays A0
- If p > 3/13 → P2 plays A1
- If p = 3/13 → indifferent

Now, from P1’s perspective: what is the optimal p?

Let’s suppose P1 uses mixed strategy, P2 best responds.

We can find the **best response** of P1.

But since we're trying to **maximize our own expected payoff**, and we are about to sign the contract, we ask: what will happen if we sign?

We assume P2 is rational and will play a best response.

So we must consider: what if we play A0 with high probability?

Let’s suppose we choose **A0 with high probability** → p large.

Then P2 will play A1 (since p > 3/13), because A1 is better when p is large.

Then P1, if choosing A0, gets 5; if choosing A1, gets 4.

So P1 prefers A0.

So if P1 chooses A0, and P2 plays A1 → outcome (A0, A1) → P1 gets 5.

But we can do better?

Wait: is there a way to get higher than 5?

Suppose we choose A0 with p = 1 (always A0).

Then P2 best response: since p = 1 > 3/13, P2 plays A1 → so outcome: (A0, A1) → P1 gets 5.

If we choose A0 with p = 0 (always A1), then P2 best response: p = 0 < 3/13 → so P2 plays A0 → outcome (A1, A0) → P1 gets 1.

If we mix at p = 3/13, then P2 is indifferent, so can play any strategy.

But P2 could still play A1 or A0 or mix.

Best payoff for us is 5, in the NE (A0, A1)

But can we get more?

Wait — is (A0, A1) the only equilibrium? And in that case we get **5**.

But what if we play a strategy where P2 plays A0?

Then outcome could be (A0, A0) or (A1, A0)

But if P2 plays A0, then P1 should play A0 (gets 10 vs 1) → so (A0, A0) is a possible outcome **only if P2 believes P1 will play A0** and P2 is indifferent or prefers A0.

But earlier, when P1 plays A0, P2 gets 20 from A1 vs 10 from A0 → so P2 will **never** play A0 if P1 plays A0.

Hence, **P2 will never play A0 in equilibrium** unless P1 plays A1.

But if P1 plays A1, P2 wants to play A0 (gives 7 > 4)

But if P2 plays A0, P1 wants to play A0, not A1.

So **no equilibrium where P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A1**.

Hence, the only stable outcome is (A0, A1), where P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1, and P1 gets **5**.

So expected payoff for us is **5** if we sign.

---

### **Step 5: Compare the two scenarios**

- If **we do not sign**, game defaults to original → P2 has dominant strategy A1 → we play A1 → payoff = 4
- If **we do sign**, then the game changes → we can get **5** in equilibrium

Wait — **5 > 4**, so signing gives us higher expected payoff.

But is that guaranteed?

Wait — is the outcome (A0, A1) the only stable outcome?

Yes, as we found: the only pure NE is (A0, A1), and mixed strategies don't give P1 better than 5.

Can P1 do better in mixed strategy?

Let’s suppose P1 plays A0 with prob p, A1 with (1-p)

Player 2 best responds:

- If p > 3/13 → P2 plays A1 → P1's expected payoff = p * 5 + (1-p) * 4 = 5p + 4 - 4p = p + 4
- If p < 3/13 → P2 plays A0 → P1's expected payoff = p * 10 + (1-p) * 1 = 10p + 1 - p = 9p + 1
- If p = 3/13 → P2 indiff → P1 can get max of 5 or 1 → assume P2 plays A1 → so 5

Now, optimize:

- For p > 3/13: payoff = p + 4 → increasing in p → max at p=1 → payoff = 5
- For p < 3/13: payoff = 9p + 1 → max at p=3/13 (left limit) → 9*(3/13) + 1 = 27/13 + 13/13 = 40/13 ≈ 3.08
- At p=3/13: pay = 5 (if P2 plays A1)

So maximum possible payoff is **5**, achieved when p=1.

So best response is to play **A0 with probability 1** → get **5**

Therefore, **if we sign**, and play A0, P2 plays A1 → we get 5.

So our **maximum possible payoff** under the contract is **5**.

Without the contract, we get **4**.

So **5 > 4**, so we should sign.

---

### **Final Check: Is Player 2 rational in agreeing?**

Remember, Player 2 proposed the contract.

If we sign, then P2 gets 20 in (A0, A1) — which is higher than what they would get otherwise (4).

In the original game, they got 4.

Now, if we sign, they get 20.

Perfect — so they **benefit** too.

So they had incentive to propose it.

We also benefit (from 4 to 5).

So both benefit.

Thus, the contract is mutually beneficial.

Hence, signing is rational.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

- Not signing → expected payoff: 4
- Signing → expected payoff: 5
- Therefore, we should sign.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P2
response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether you (Player 2) should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game without the contract

The original payoff matrix (with Player 1 as row, Player 2 as column):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**               | (10, 10) | (2, 6)   |
| **A1**               | (20, 0)  | (4, 4)   |

You are Player 2.

We analyze the best responses:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You get: 10 (if A0), 2 (if A1) → better to play A0.
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You get: 2 (if A0), 4 (if A1) → better to play A1.

So your response depends on what Player 1 does.

Now consider rationality of both players. Let’s look for Nash equilibria.

#### Pure strategy Nash equilibria?

Check (A0, A0):  
- Player 1: if deviates to A1, gets 20 > 10 → wants to deviate. Not equilibrium.

(A0, A1):  
- Player 1: if switches to A1, gets 2 instead of 2? Wait: at (A0, A1), payoffs are (2,6). If Player 1 switches to A1, they get (4,4) — so gains from 2 → 4 → wants to switch. Not equilibrium.

(A1, A0):  
- Player 1: now gets 20, staying gives 20; switching to A0 gives only 10 < 20 → no incentive.  
- Player 2: currently gets 2; if switches to A1, gets 4 → wants to switch. So not equilibrium.

(A1, A1):  
- Player 1: getting 4; if switches to A0, gets 2 < 4 → stays.  
- Player 2: getting 4; if switches to A0, gets 2 < 4 → stays.

✅ So (A1, A1) is a pure Nash equilibrium.

Is there another? No others satisfy mutual best responses.

But let’s also check mixed strategies.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the contract

The contract says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

This means:
- If *you* choose A0, you gain +10 points (from the other player's pocket).
- If the *other* player chooses A0, they gain +10 points (from your pocket).
- Choosing A1 has no extra payout.

Importantly: **the contract is active only if both players sign it.**

So if you do **not** sign, the contract doesn’t apply.

If you **do** sign, but the other player doesn’t, then contract still does not apply → same as no contract.

So: only when **both** sign, the contract takes effect.

Thus, we must consider whether signing improves your expected payoff **assuming the other player also signs**, or potentially influences their decision.

But note: you are deciding **after** the contract was proposed via approval voting and selected. So the contract exists and is ready to be activated if both agree.

We need to evaluate: **Should YOU sign?**

Let’s suppose you sign. Then, for the contract to take effect, the other player must also sign. But since you don't know whether they will sign, you have to decide based on expectations.

However, the prompt says: "you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract." And no information about the other player's intentions.

So we assume that **signing the contract will lead to its activation only if both players sign**. Therefore, **your signing alone is not sufficient** — you must expect that Player 1 will also sign.

But here’s a more subtle point: **Approval voting was used to select the contract**, implying that Player 1 approved it. That likely means they are willing to sign.

So unless told otherwise, we can reasonably assume that **Player 1 will sign the contract**, because it was approved via approval voting (proposed and passed by Player 1).

So: **assume the contract will become active if you sign.**

Therefore, the contract will apply **if you sign**. We proceed under that assumption.

---

### Step 3: Update payoff with contract active

Now, when a player chooses A0, they get +10 bonus, paid by the other player.

So we must adjust the payoff matrix accordingly.

Recall: both players are choosing probabilities simultaneously, and actions are drawn randomly based on those probabilities.

But since the contract affects payoffs depending on choice, we recompute the payoffs.

Let’s write the new payoff matrix (under contract, both signed):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (with +10 to choosers) | A1 |
|---------|----------------------------|----|
| **A0** | (10 + 10, 10 + 10) = (20, 20) | (2, 6) → but wait: only P1 chose A0 so P1 gets +10, P2 chose A1 → P2 gets nothing extra. So final: (20 + 10, 6) = (30, 6) |
| **A1** | (2, 6) → P1 chose A1 → no bonus, P2 chose A0 → P2 gets +10 → so P2 gets 6+10=16 → (2, 16) | (4,4) → both chose A1 → no bonus → (4,4) |

Wait carefully:

Each action triggers the bonus **if a player chooses it**.

So:

- When **P1 plays A0**: gets +10
- When **P2 plays A0**: gets +10
- When either plays A1: no bonus.

And the +10 is taken from the other player.

So for each cell:

1. (A0, A0):
   - P1: 10 + 10 = 20 (base 10 + bonus 10)
   - P2: 10 + 10 = 20 (base 10 + bonus 10)

2. (A1, A0):
   - P1: 2 (base) → no bonus (played A1)
   - P2: 6 (base) + 10 (bonus for A0) = 16

   So (2, 16)

3. (A0, A1):
   - P1: 20 (base) + 10 (bonus for A0) = 30
   - P2: 0 (base) → no bonus (played A1)
   So (30, 0)

4. (A1, A1):
   - Both played A1 → no bonuses → (4, 4)

So revised payoff matrix under contract:

|        | A0    | A1    |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **A0** | (20,20) | (30,0) |
| **A1** | (2,16)  | (4,4)  |

Now, you are Player 2.

Let’s find your best responses.

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You get: 20 (if A0), 0 (if A1) → so prefer A0
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You get: 16 (if A0), 4 (if A1) → prefer A0

So in **both cases**, your best response is to play A0.

Therefore, **A0 is a dominant strategy for you** under the contract.

That means, regardless of what Player 1 does, playing A0 gives you higher payoff.

So optimal for you: always play A0.

What about Player 1?

Let’s check their incentives.

- If you play A0:
  - P1 gets 20 (if A0), 2 (if A1) → prefers A0
- If you play A1:
  - P1 gets 30 (if A0), 4 (if A1) → prefers A0

So A0 is also dominant for Player 1.

So the unique Nash equilibrium under contract is: **(A0, A0)** → (20, 20)

Your expected payoff: 20 points.

---

### Step 4: Compare with original game

In the original game, without contract, we had:

- (A1, A1) as the only pure Nash equilibrium → (4, 4)

But in that case, could you do better?

Suppose you try to play optimally.

Without contract, you know that:
- If you play A0 and they play A0 → 10
- If you play A0 and they play A1 → 2
- If you play A1 and they play A0 → 20
- If you play A1 and they play A1 → 4

You cannot commit to anything. But in symmetric belief, maybe they play A1 (equilibrium), so you get 4.

Or suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p.

Then your expected payoff:

- If you play A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2
- If you play A1: 20p + 4(1-p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4

Compare: 16p + 4 vs 8p + 2 → difference: (16p + 4) - (8p + 2) = 8p + 2

Which is always positive for p ≥ 0.

So A1 dominates A0 for you in the original game?

Wait: 8p + 2 > 0 always → so A1 always strictly better?

Wait: for any p ∈ [0,1], 16p + 4 > 8p + 2?

Yes: 8p + 2 > 0 → true even for p=0 → 0 + 2 = 2 < 4 → yes, 16(0)+4=4 > 8(0)+2=2

So for all p, A1 gives higher expected payoff than A0.

So A1 is dominant strategy for you in original game.

Similarly, for Player 1:

- If you play A0: P1 gets 10 (A0), 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- If you play A1: P1 gets 2 (A0), 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So A1 is dominant for P1 too.

Thus, (A1, A1) is the only NE → you get 4.

**But under contract, you get 20.**

That’s much better.

Even if you consider mixed strategies — but in the original game, no matter what, if both play A1, you get only 4.

Under contract, if you sign, and assuming P1 signs, then Nash equilibrium implies both play A0, and you get 20.

So **your expected payoff increases from 4 to 20**.

Also, under contract, you are guaranteed 20 in the equilibrium — and dominating strategy — so you’ll do that.

---

### Step 5: Is there any downside?

Only risk: what if Player 1 doesn't sign?

But recall: the contract was selected via **approval voting proposed by Player 1**. So Player 1 clearly supports it.

So unless there’s evidence to the contrary, it's rational to believe that Player 1 will sign.

Thus, if you sign, the contract activates → you get 20.

If you don’t sign, then no contract → you’re back in original game → expected payoff: maximum 4 (in NE), possibly less if off-equilibrium.

So you're better off signing.

Moreover, **you are Player 2**, and in the contract, playing A0 gives you +10. This rewards cooperation.

You’re not losing anything: you’re gaining.

Even if the other player didn't sign, you don’t lose anything (contract not active), so you’re just in original game anyway.

But if you sign and they do too, you gain 20 > 4.

So signing is a **weakly dominant strategy**: you never lose, and you potentially gain significantly.

Hence, rational to sign.

Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step, with the goal of **maximizing your total points** as **Player 1**.

---

### 🔷 **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|                | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**     | (10, 10) | (0, 20) |
| **P1: A1**     | (6, 2)  | (4, 4)  |

This is a type of coordination game with a conflict of interest.

We are Player 1. Let's examine the incentives.

#### Strategic Analysis:

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So P1’s best response depends on P2’s action.

Similarly for P2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

P2 **always** prefers A1, regardless of P1.

So P2 will **always play A1** in equilibrium (since A1 strictly dominates A0 for P2).

Given that, P1’s optimal choice is to play **A1**, since:
- If P2 plays A1 (which they will), then:
  - A0 gives 0
  - A1 gives 4
  → So P1 chooses A1

Thus, **in the base game**, we expect the outcome to be:
- (A1, A1) → P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4

But now, contracts can be introduced.

---

### 🔷 **Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

- A contract specifies **additional payments** based on the action chosen.
- These payments are **transferred between players**.
- **Approval voting**: Each player votes **yes/no** on each contract.
- The **winning contract** is selected **uniform at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.
- So, to maximize your chances of getting a favorable outcome, you want:
  - Contracts you approve to be **approved by at least one other player** (but since you’re only voting, you only control your own votes)
  - More importantly: **Only approve contracts that are good for you**, and potentially **block bad ones**, even if they might be good for you if they’re not selected.

But here's the twist: the contract is **applied only if approved by both players**?  
No — the description says:

> “a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process.”

And: “The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.”

So:
- Both players vote on each contract.
- The contracts with the **highest number of approvals** are considered.
- One of them is **chosen uniformly at random**.
- So if C1 has 1 approval, C2 has 2, C3 has 2 → then C2 and C3 are winners → one is picked at random.

Your **goal**: maximize your **expected total points**, accounting for:
- Which contract gets selected
- What actions you and the other player will play **under that contract**

Important: **The contract affects payoffs**, and **players choose actions based on the modified payoffs**.

So the contract changes the incentives — potentially changing the equilibrium outcome.

---

### 🔷 **Step 3: Analyze Each Contract**

We now evaluate **each contract** in terms of:
1. How it modifies the payoffs (for both players)
2. What equilibrium (action choices) would arise under that contract
3. What your expected payoff would be under that contract (if it’s selected)

Then, decide **whether to approve it** — because approving it increases the chance it gets selected (and you want favorable ones selected).

## ✅ **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1**

> - If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So:
- If you (P1) choose A0 → **you lose 1 point**, and the other player (P2) gains 1 point.
- If P2 chooses A0 → P2 loses 1, P1 gains 1.
- A1 → no cost or gain.

Let’s build the **new payoff matrix** under C1:

### New Payoffs (C1):

|                | P2: A0       | P2: A1       |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0**     | 10 - 1 = 9, 10 + 1 = 11 | 0 - 0 = 0, 20 + 0 = 20 |
| **P1: A1**     | 6 + 1 = 7, 2 - 1 = 1 | 4 + 0 = 4, 4 + 0 = 4 |

Wait: **Clarify the payment rule**.

> “If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.”

Since there are two players, “other players” = 1 other player → so the **entire 1 point is paid to the other player**.

So:
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 loses 1, P2 gains 1.
- If P2 plays A0 → P2 loses 1, P1 gains 1.

Thus, corrected matrix:

### Payoffs under C1:

- (A0, A0): (10 - 1, 10 + 1) = (9, 11)
- (A0, A1): (0, 20)
- (A1, A0): (6 + 1, 2 - 1) = (7, 1)
- (A1, A1): (4, 4)

So:

|                | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**     | (9, 11) | (0, 20) |
| **P1: A1**     | (7, 1)  | (4, 4)  |

Now analyze strategic behavior under C1.

#### Player 2’s incentives:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 11 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So P2 **always plays A1**.

Then P1:
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So **equilibrium: (A1, A1) → P1 gets 4**

Wait: P1 still gets **4**?

But let’s compute:

- If P1 chooses A0 when P2 plays A1 → (A0, A1) → P1 gets 0
- A1 → 4

So yes, P1 still plays A1.

So outcome: **(A1, A1)** → P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4

But under C1, **contract only affects A0 players**, and since no one plays A0 in equilibrium, **the contract has no effect**.

So in this case, **your payoff is still 4**, same as base game.

But who benefits? P2 gains 1 when P1 plays A0 — but **P1 never plays A0**, so **no one pays or receives anything**.

So **the contract is redundant** — it doesn't change outcomes.

But now, since the contract was **proposed by you (P1)**, and you are considering **approving it**, would you want to approve a contract that does nothing?

Well, if it has **no effect** on your payoff, and you **get 4 either way**, and the outcome is unchanged, then **approving it doesn't hurt you**, but **doesn't help**.

But wait — **what if other players are rational?** Could they be induced to play differently?

No — clearly, P2 still strictly prefers A1, and P1 still prefers A1.

So **no impact**.

So C1 → net payoff for P1: 4

Does it change the behavior? No.

So **approving C1 gives you no benefit**, but **no loss**.

So you **could approve** it — but if you want to maximize expected payoff, **only approve if it's likely to improve your payoff**.

But here, it doesn't.

However, since the contract is **proposed by you**, and you're trying to **get a favorable contract selected**, perhaps you should **only approve contracts that are good for you**.

But since C1 gives you **no advantage**, and **does nothing**, you may want to **approve it only if you believe others might approve it**, but since you're the proposer, maybe others won’t.

Let’s look at C2.

---

## ✅ **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

So:
- If you (P1) choose A0 → you receive 11, and P2 loses 11 (because it's drawn from "other players").
- If P2 chooses A0 → P2 receives 11, and P1 loses 11.
- A1 → no effect.

So payoffs under C2:

Let’s build the matrix.

- (A0, A0): P1: 10 + 11 = 21, P2: 10 + 11 = 21
- Wait — no: the 11 is “drawn equally from the other players”

P2 chooses A0 → 11 paid to P2, so P1 loses 11 → P1 gets 10 - 11 = -1
P2 gets 10 + 11 = 21

But wait: if **both** play A0?

- P1’s action: A0 → so P1 gains 11 from A0 choice
- But P2’s action: A0 → P2 gains 11
- But the payment “drawn from other players” — but there are two others? No, only one other.

So:
- Each player who plays A0 **receives 11**, paid **by the other player(s)**.
- Since only one other player, **the 11 is deducted from the other player**.

So:
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gains 11, P2 loses 11
- If P2 plays A0 → P2 gains 11, P1 loses 11
- If both play A0 → P1 gains 11 (from A0), but loses 11 (because P2 played A0), so net = 0 from contract → plus base 10 → 10
  - P2: gains 11 from own A0, loses 11 from P1’s A0 → net 0 → 10

Wait, that’s important.

Actually, the rule says: “If a player chooses A0, they receive 11, drawn equally from the other players.”

“Drawn equally from the other players” — so if **P1 plays A0**, then P1 gets +11, and P2 loses 11 (since only one other).

If **P2 plays A0**, then P2 gets +11, P1 loses 11.

So **if both play A0**:
- P1 gets: +11 (from self) -11 (from P2’s action) = 0
- So total P1 payoff = 10 + 0 = 10
- P2: +11 -11 = 0 → 10

Similarly, if only one plays A0:
- Is P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets: +11 (from A0), and P2 didn't play A0 → so no loss → total: 0 + 11 = 11
  - P2: 20 (base) + 0 = 20 → and gets no loss

Wait, no: P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +11 → from contract → so 0 + 11 = 11
P2: 20 (base), and no payment made to P2, so keeps 20

But if P2 plays A0, P1 gets -11 → so P1’s payoff = 0 - 11 = -11

Similarly, if P2 plays A0 and P1 plays A1:
- P1: 6 (base) -11 = -5
- P2: 2 (base) +11 = 13

Now build the full payoff matrix for C2:

|                | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**     | (10, 10)       | (11, 20)       |
| **P1: A1**     | (-5, 13)       | (4, 4)         |

Wait, let’s compute all:

1. (A0, A0):  
   - P1: 10 (base) +11 (from own A0) -11 (from P2’s A0) = 10  
   - P2: 10 +11 -11 = 10  
   → (10, 10)

2. (A0, A1):  
   - P1: 0 +11 (own A0, P2 not A0 → no loss) = 11  
   - P2: 20 (base) → 20  
   → (11, 20)

3. (A1, A0):  
   - P1: 6 (base) +0 (didn't play A0) -11 (P2 played A0) = -5  
   - P2: 2 (base) +11 = 13  
   → (-5, 13)

4. (A1, A1):  
   - Both A1 → no change  
   → (4, 4)

So matrix:

|                | P2: A0       | P2: A1       |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0**     | (10, 10)     | (11, 20)     |
| **P1: A1**     | (-5, 13)     | (4, 4)       |

Now analyze best responses.

#### P2’s incentives:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 13 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → **prefers A0**

So P2's best response depends:
- A0 if P1 plays A1
- A1 if P1 plays A0

So no pure strategy dominant.

Now P1:
- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 10 (A0) vs -5 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 11 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P1 always prefers A0**, regardless of P2.

So P1 plays A0.

Then P2: given P1 plays A0 → P2 prefers A1 (20 > 10)

So equilibrium: **(A0, A1)** → P1 gets 11, P2 gets 20

This is **very good for P1**.

Under C2, if it is selected, **you (P1) get 11 points**.

Compare to base game: you got 4.

And even C1 gave you 4.

So C2 is **much better** for you.

Now, is C2 good for P2?

- P2 gets 20 if P1 plays A0 → which they will
- But if P2 plays A0, they get only 10 (in equilibrium), but P1 plays A0, so P2 prefers A1.

So P2 gets 20 → better than base game (4) → so P2 actually **likes C2 too**.

Wait: in base game, P2 gets 4 when (A1, A1) → now under C2, P2 gets 20 → so **P2 benefits**.

Moreover, P2 might even prefer this contract.

But let's check if P2 would approve it.

But we are only making **our own decision** — we are P1.

We don’t know what P2 will do.

But the goal is to **maximize our expected points**.

So:
- If C2 is selected, outcome is (A0, A1), you get 11.
- If C1 is selected, outcome is (A1, A1), you get 4.
- If no contract is selected? **But per rules, a contract is selected from approvals — and the one with most approvals**.

But here there are only two contracts: C1 and C2.

Now, suppose:
- You approve **only C2** → then C2 has 1 approval, C1 has ? — depends on P2.

If P2 approves C2 → C2 has 2 approvals → wins → you get 11.

If P2 doesn’t approve C2 → then C2 has 1 approval, C1 has 1 (if you approve it) → both have 1 → random selection → you get (11 + 4)/2 = 7.5 on average.

But if you **only approve C2**, and P2 also approves C2 → you get 11.

If P2 **doesn’t approve C2**, but only approves C1 → then C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → random → 7.5

But if you **approve C1**, then C1 has 2 approvals (if you and P2 both approve) → then C1 wins → you get 4.

That’s worse.

But P2 is going to vote.

But we **don't know** how P2 will vote.

But: **P2's self-interest**?

Let’s evaluate whether P2 would want C2.

P2’s payoff under C2:
- In equilibrium: (A0, A1) → P2 gets 20
- In base game: 4
- So P2 is **happier** under C2.

Under C1:
- P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1 → (4,4)
- So P2 gets 4 → same as base
- But in C2, P2 gets 20 → so much better

So P2 has **strong incentive** to approve **C2**, and **not approve C1** (since C1 gives them nothing extra, and C2 gives them 20).

So likely: **P2 will approve C2, not C1**

But what if you approve C1?

Then C1 has 1 approval (only you), C2 has 1 (P2), so tie → random selection → your expected payoff: (4 + 11)/2 = 7.5

But if you **only approve C2**, and P2 approves C2 → C2 wins → you get 11

If P2 doesn’t approve C2 → but approves C1 → then C1: 1 (you and P2), C2: 1 (P2? no) — wait:

Wait, P2 approving C2 → then C2 has 1 (only P2), if you don't approve it → C2: 1, C1: 0? No.

Let’s suppose:

- You approve only C2
- P2 approves C2

→ C2: 2 approvals, C1: 0 → C2 wins → you get 11

- You approve only C2
- P2 approves C1

→ C1: 1 (P2), C2: 1 (you) → tie → random → 7.5

- You approve C1 and C2
- P2 approves C2

→ C2: 2, C1: 1 → C2 wins → you get 11

- You approve C1 and C2
- P2 approves C1

→ C1: 2, C2: 1 → C1 wins → you get 4

But given that P2 gets 20 under C2 vs 4 under C1, **P2 will strongly prefer C2**.

It's irrational for P2 to approve C1.

So **P2 will approve C2**, and **not approve C1**.

Therefore, the only contract that can win is C2 — unless you approve C1 and P2 approves C1, but P2 has no reason to.

So the **most likely outcome** is: C2 wins → you get 11.

Now, if you **approve C1**, you risk that if both approve C1 (unlikely), you get 4, which is bad.

But if you don’t approve C1, and only C2 has 2 approvals, you get 11 — best.

And even if P2 doesn’t approve C1 (likely), and you approve only C2 → C2 wins → 11

So your **best strategy** is to **approve only C2**, and **not approve C1**

But what if you approve C1? It doesn’t hurt you **if C2 wins**, but if C1 wins (e.g., P2 approves C1), you get 4 — worse.

So **never favorable**.

But also: approving C1 is irrelevant if C2 wins — but **it doesn’t help**.

So to **maximize expected payoff**, you should **only approve contracts that are good for you and have a chance of being selected**.

C1 is **not good** for you (you get 4, same as base), and **C2 gives you 11**, so better.

Moreover, since P2 is likely to **only approve C2**, then **only C2 will have more than one approval**.

So you should **approve C2**.

But you should **not approve C1**, because:
- It gives you no benefit
- If it’s selected, you get 4, which is **worse than the 11 you can get under C2**
- And since C1 is only proposed by you, and P2 has no incentive to approve it, it’s unlikely to be selected anyway
- But if you approve it, you might help C1 win if P2 approves it — but P2 has no reason to

So **approve C2**, **do not approve C1**

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

- C1 (proposed by you): **don’t approve** → it gives no benefit, and reduces your upside
- C2 (proposed by P2): **approve** → gives you 11 points in equilibrium, which is much better than 4

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoffs with the contract

The contract modifies the basic payoffs:
- If I choose A0: I receive +3 from the other player
- If I choose A1: I pay -13 to the other player
- Same rules apply to the other player

Let me calculate my actual payoffs for each outcome:

**Case 1: I play A0, Other plays A0**
- Base: 10
- I chose A0: +3 from other
- Other chose A0: -3 to other
- **My total: 10 + 3 - 3 = 10**

**Case 2: I play A0, Other plays A1**
- Base: 0
- I chose A0: +3 from other
- Other chose A1: +13 from other (they pay me)
- **My total: 0 + 3 + 13 = 16**

**Case 3: I play A1, Other plays A0**
- Base: 6
- I chose A1: -13 to other
- Other chose A0: -3 to other
- **My total: 6 - 13 - 3 = -10**

**Case 4: I play A1, Other plays A1**
- Base: 4
- I chose A1: -13 to other
- Other chose A1: +13 from other
- **My total: 4 - 13 + 13 = 4**

## Step 2: Compare my options

Modified payoff matrix for me:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me **10**, A1 gives me **-10** → A0 is better
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me **16**, A1 gives me **4** → A0 is better

## Step 3: Determine optimal strategy

**A0 strictly dominates A1** for me - regardless of what the other player does, I always get more points by choosing A0.

Therefore, my optimal strategy is to choose A0 with 100% probability.

Let's go through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without contracts)**

We are Player 1. Our actions: A0 or A1.  
The other player (Player 2) chooses A0 or A1 simultaneously.  
The payoff matrix (for Player 1, then Player 2) is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10 | 0, 20  |
| **P1: A1**    | 6, 2   | 4, 4   |

This is a classic asymmetric coordination game.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze best responses and Nash equilibria in the original game**

Let’s find the pure strategy Nash equilibria.

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1’s best response: A0 (10 > 6)
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1’s best response: A1 (4 > 0)

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2’s best response: A0 (10 > 20? No — 20 > 10) → wait: P2 gets 20 if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1 → so P2 prefers A1.
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2’s best response: A1 (4 > 2)

So:
- (A0, A0): P1 is happy (10 > 6), but P2 is not (20 > 10), so P2 wants to deviate → not NE
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, but prefers A1 (4 > 0) → P1 deviates → not NE
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 6, prefers A0? 10 > 6 → P1 deviates → not NE
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4. If P1 deviates to A0 → gets 0 < 4 → won’t deviate. If P2 deviates to A0 → gets 2 < 4 → won’t deviate. → **This is a Nash equilibrium**

So the only **pure strategy Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1), giving each player 4 points.

There may be mixed strategies, but since we’re evaluating contracts and voting, we need to think about expected payoffs under possible outcomes — especially how contracts change incentives.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the contracts**

Each contract adds a **transfer** based on the action chosen.

Let’s break down both contracts.

---

### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:
- If you play A0 → you lose 1 point **in addition to the original payoff**.  
- If you play A1 → no extra cost.
- The "distributed equally among the other players" — since there are **two players**, each other player gets 0.5 of the 1-point penalty.
  - But wait: "distributed equally among the other players" → so if **you** play A0, you lose 1 point, and **the other player** gains 1 point.
    - Because only one other player → so **you lose 1**, **the other gains 1**.
    - So it's a one-way transfer from the A0 player to the other player.

So net effect for **Player 1**:
- If Player 1 plays A0: **1 point deducted** from their payoff.
- If Player 1 plays A1: no change.

Similarly, for **Player 2**:
- If Player 2 plays A0: **1 point deducted** from their payoff.

So if both play A0: P1 gets 10 - 1 = 9, P2 gets 10 - 1 = 9
- But P1 pays 1 → P2 gets it → so 10 + 1 = 11? No.

Wait — **Clarify**: does “pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed among the other players” mean:
- The player chooses A0 → they pay 1 point to the other player?

Yes, that’s the natural interpretation.

So **A0 player loses 1 point, the other player gains 1 point** — but only if **they** played A0.

So:
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 loses 1, P2 gains 1 (if P2 played something? No — it's independent.)
Wait — the payment is **made by the player who chooses A0**, and **goes to the other player**, regardless of what the other does.

But “distributed equally among the other players” — only one other player → so **that player gets the full 1 point**.

So yes: **Each player who plays A0 pays 1 point to the other player**.

So:
- If both play A0: P1 loses 1, P2 loses 1 → P1 total = 10 - 1 = 9, P2 total = 10 - 1 = 9
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1: P1 pays 1 → gets 0 - 1 = -1, P2 gets +1 → 20 + 1 = 21
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0: P1 gets 6, P2 pays 1 → gets 2 - 1 = 1
- If both play A1: no cost → both get 4

So modified payoff matrix (C1 applied):

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 9, 9         | -1, 21        |
| **P1: A1**    | 6, 1         | 4, 4          |

---

### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payments
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If you play A1 → you pay 5 points → goes to the other player → other player gains 5
- If you play A0 → no transfer

So:
- If P1 plays A1 → P1 loses 5, P2 gains 5
- If P2 plays A1 → P2 loses 5, P1 gains 5

So let’s write the new payoff matrix (C2):

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 0, 20 + 5 = 25 |
| **P1: A1**    | 6 + 5 = 11, 2 | 4 + 5 = 9, 4 - 5 = -1 |

Explanation:
- (A0, A0): no cost → (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 5 → P1 gains 5 → so P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5? Wait, original is 0? No:

Wait — original payoff: when P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1 → P1 gets 0, P2 gets 20.

Now: P2 chooses A1 → so P2 pays 5 → so P2 gets 20 - 5 = 15, and P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5.

Similarly:
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → pays 5 → P1 gets 6 - 5 = 1, P2 gets 2 + 5 = 7
- (A1, A1): both pay 5 → P1 gets 4 - 5 = -1, P2 gets 4 - 5 = -1

Wait — but “distributed equally among the other players” — if both play A1, then each pays 5 to the other → P1 loses 5 to P2, P2 loses 5 to P1 → net zero?

Yes — so **each player pays 5, and receives 5 from the other player** → they end up with their original payoff.

But let’s be careful.

> If a player chooses A1, they pay 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.

With two players, “distribute among other players” → the other player gets 5.

So if **only P2 plays A1**: P2 pays 5 → goes to P1 → so P2 gets 20 - 5 = 15, P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5.

If **only P1 plays A1**: P1 pays 5 → goes to P2 → P1 gets 6 - 5 = 1, P2 gets 2 + 5 = 7.

If **both play A1**: each pays 5 → P1 loses 5, gains 5 → net 0 → so P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4 → original.

If **neither plays A1** → both A0 → neither pays → (10,10)

So revised payoff matrix (C2):

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 5, 15         |
| **P1: A1**    | 1, 7         | 4, 4          |

Wait — corrections:
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → no cost. P2 plays A1 → pays 5 → P1 gets +5, P2 gets -5 → so P1: 0 + 5 = 5, P2: 20 - 5 = 15 → yes
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → pays 5 → P1: 6 - 5 = 1, P2: 2 + 5 = 7 → yes
- (A1, A1): both pay 5 → P1: 4 - 5 + 5 = 4, P2: 4 - 5 + 5 = 4 → so (4,4)
- (A0, A0): (10,10)

So yes.

So C2 payoff matrix:

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 5, 15         |
| **P1: A1**    | 1, 7         | 4, 4          |

---

### **Step 4: Analyze each contract from **Player 1’s** perspective**

We want to **maximize** our own expected payoff.

But **only contracts that are approved by a majority** can be enacted. The **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.**

However, we are only deciding **which contracts to approve** — we do **not** know how the other player votes.

But notice: the contract is **approved via voting**, and we must decide **which** contracts we want to support.

Since the final contract is selected at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**, we should **strategically approve contracts** so that we maximize our **expected payoff**, considering:
- Our approval affects the number of approvals each contract gets
- We cannot control the other player’s vote
- The winning contract is the one with **maximum approvals**, chosen uniformly at random among those with that max

So we should **only approve contracts that we believe will maximize our expected payoff**, given uncertainty about the other player’s vote.

But to be safe, let’s assume the other player is rational and wants to maximize their payoff (as we do). We can simulate possible outcomes.

But since we are only choosing approvals, and the contract with **most approvals** wins (randomly if tied), we must choose whom to support.

Let’s suppose we **approve only** contracts that are **good for us** and **likely** to win.

But both contracts are proposed by the **opposing player**, so they might be biased.

But we are only concerned with **our own payoff**.

Let’s evaluate each contract **from our perspective (Player 1)**, in terms of **what our expected payoff would be if the contract is adopted**, and whether we think it’s **worth approving** to help it win.

But note: approving a contract only increases its approval count — so to make a contract more likely to be selected (or tie for highest), we should approve contracts that we like.

But we can approve both or only one.

Let’s compute the **expected payoff** under each contract, assuming both players play optimally.

Then we can see which contract gives us higher expected payoff.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze optimal play under each contract**

---

#### **Contract C1: C1 payoff matrix (Player 1’s perspective)**

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 9, 9         | -1, 21        |
| **P1: A1**    | 6, 1         | 4, 4          |

Let’s compute best responses.

Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 max is max(9,6) → A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 max is max(-1,4) → A1

Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2’s payoffs: 9 vs 21 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: P2’s payoffs: 1 vs 4 → prefers A1

So P2 always prefers A1? Let’s see.

From P2’s perspective:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 9 (if plays A0) or 21 (if plays A1) → so A1
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → A1

So **P2’s dominant strategy is A1**

Then P1, knowing P2 plays A1, will choose:
- A0: gets -1
- A1: gets 4 → so chooses A1

So **only Nash equilibrium in C1: (A1, A1)** → P1 gets 4

But let’s also check if there are other equilibria.

Suppose both play A1 → P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4 → P1 wouldn’t deviate to A0 (gets -1 < 4), P2 wouldn’t deviate (1 < 4) → yes, (A1, A1) is NE.

Is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?

Suppose P2 plays A0 with prob q, A1 with (1-q)

P1’s expected payoff:
- A0: q×9 + (1-q)×(-1) = 9q -1 + q = 10q -1
- A1: q×6 + (1-q)×4 = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4

Set equal: 10q -1 = 2q + 4 → 8q = 5 → q = 5/8

So if P2 plays A0 with 5/8, P1 is indifferent.

Now P1’s best response: if P2 plays q = 5/8, P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now from P2’s side: suppose P1 plays A0 with p, A1 with (1-p)

P2’s payoffs:
- A0: p×9 + (1-p)×1 = 9p + 1 - p = 8p + 1
- A1: p×21 + (1-p)×4 = 21p + 4 - 4p = 17p + 4

Set equal for indifference: 8p + 1 = 17p + 4 → 1 - 4 = 17p - 8p → -3 = 9p → p = -1/3 → impossible

So P2 **never** plays A0 in equilibrium — since even for low p, 17p + 4 > 8p + 1? Let’s plug p=0:
- A0: 1
- A1: 4 → better → so P2 always prefers A1

So in **any** Bayes-Nash equilibrium, P2 plays A1 with probability 1.

Then P1 plays A1 → gets 4

So **under C1, expected payoff for P1 is 4**

---

#### **Contract C2: C2 payoff matrix**

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 5, 15         |
| **P1: A1**    | 1, 7         | 4, 4          |

Now analyze.

P2’s best responses:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 7 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So P2’s best response depends on P1.

P1’s best responses:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P1 always prefers A0**?

Wait:
- P1: A0 → A0: 10, A1: 5 → so A0 better
- So **P1’s dominant strategy is A0**

Now P2: if P1 plays A0 → P2’s best response is A1

So in equilibrium: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → outcome is (A0, A1)

Payoff: P1 gets 5,

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether you should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

We are in a 2-player simultaneous-move game, with actions A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (for you as Player 1):

|          | Other Player: A0 | Other Player: A1 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **You: A0** | (10, 10)         | (0, 20)          |
| **You: A1** | (6, 2)           | (4, 4)           |

This is a classic coordination game with some conflict of interest.

Let’s analyze the incentives:

- If the other player plays A0:
  - You get 10 for A0, 6 for A1 → you prefer A0.
- If the other player plays A1:
  - You get 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → you prefer A1.

So your best response depends on what the other player does.

The Nash equilibria in the base game:
- (A0, A0): both get 10 – stable since neither wants to deviate unilaterally.
- (A1, A1): both get 4 – also stable.
- (A0, A1): you get 0, so you’d want to deviate to A1 → not equilibrium.
- (A1, A0): you get 6, they get 2; they would want to deviate to A1 to get 4 instead of 2 → not equilibrium.

So two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). There may also be a mixed-strategy equilibrium, but since we’re deciding on a contract, we’ll focus on how the contract changes the incentives.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

The contract says:
- If you choose A0 → you receive **+5 points**, and **this cost is taken equally from the other player**.
- If you choose A1 → no additional payment.

So, the payment is **transferred from the other player to you**, with **5 points** paid if you choose A0.

> Note: **This is only active if both players sign.** So we must assume the other player signs; otherwise, no contract.

But we are deciding whether to sign — so we must evaluate: **Would I benefit from the contract, assuming the other player also signs?**

Assume the other player signs → contract is active.

So the **modified payoffs** (your points) are:

| Your Action | Their Action | Your Payoff (with contract) | Their Payoff (with contract) |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| A0          | A0           | 10 + 5 = 15                 | 10 - 5 = 5                    |
| A0          | A1           | 0 + 5 = 5                   | 20 - 5 = 15                   |
| A1          | A0           | 6                           | 2                             |
| A1          | A1           | 4                           | 4                             |

Now, the new game matrix:

|          | Other Player: A0 | Other Player: A1 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **You: A0** | (15, 5)          | (5, 15)          |
| **You: A1** | (6, 2)           | (4, 4)           |

Let’s analyze your best responses under the contract:

- If other player plays A0: you get 15 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefer A0.
- If other player plays A1: you get 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0.

So **no matter what** the other player does, **you prefer A0**!

That means A0 is a **dominant strategy** for you under the contract.

Now check the other player’s incentives:

- If you play A0: they get 5 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → prefer A1.
- If you play A1: they get 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A1.

So: **A1 is dominant for them**, regardless of your action.

Wait! This is interesting.

Under the contract:
- Your best response: **A0** (dominant)
- Their best response: **A1** (dominant)

Therefore, the unique Nash equilibrium under the contract is: **You play A0, they play A1**

Then expected payoff:
- You: 5 points
- Other player: 15 points

But wait — this seems bad for you compared to the base game?

Let’s compare to the base game.

In the base game, you could get 10 if both play A0 — which is better than 5.

But under the contract, you are forced into a situation where **you have a dominant strategy to play A0**, but the other player has a dominant strategy to play A1 → **you end up with 5**, and they get 15.

Is this better than the base game?

Let’s examine what happens in the base game.

In the base game, possible equilibria:
- (A0, A0): you get 10
- (A1, A1): you get 4

So the best you can guarantee is 10 (in equilibrium), or worst case 0 or 4.

But suppose in the base game, you and the other player can coordinate on (A0, A0). That gives you 10.

But under the contract, if you sign, and they sign, you’re locked into a unique outcome: (A0, A1) → you get 5, they get 15.

So you **lose** in expected payoff if the outcome is (A0, A1).

But — wait: is coordination possible?

You should ask: **Can the contract improve your payoff?**

Only if you can get better than 10.

But under the contract, your best possible outcome is 15 (if both play A0), but **only if they play A0**.

But in the contract, the other player has **no incentive** to play A0 — because:

- If you play A0, they get 5 for A0 vs 15 for A1 → so they prefer A1
- If you play A1, they get 2 for A0 vs 4 for A1 → they still prefer A1

So they **always** prefer A1. So they will play A1.

You will play A0 (because it's dominant).

So outcome: (A0, A1) → you get 5.

In the base game, you could achieve (A0, A0) → you get 10.

So **by signing the contract, you go from possibly getting 10 to guaranteed 5**.

But is that the only possibility?

Wait — is there a chance the other player cooperates?

No — because in the contract, **they have a dominant strategy to play A1**.

So rational players will end up at (A0, A1), giving you 5.

So signing the contract forces you into a worse outcome than what you could get via coordination in the base game.

But what if you don’t sign? Then the base game applies, with no contract.

Then you can potentially coordinate with the other player on (A0, A0), and get 10.

Even if you can’t coordinate, you could still play A0 with some probability.

But the key is: **by signing, you are giving up the opportunity to achieve (A0, A0) or even (A1, A1)**, in favor of a guaranteed 5.

Is there any scenario where signing helps?

Suppose your partner is irrational or not optimizing. But we assume rational play.

Alternatively, suppose you think the other player is more likely to play A0 in the base game — then playing A0 gives you 10.

But under contract, if they are rational, they play A1 anyway, so you still get 5.

So **signing the contract reduces your payoff from 10 (in equilibrium) to 5 (under contract)**.

Even worse: if for some reason you are forced to play A1 under the contract, you get 4.

But under contract, you can still play A1, but you don’t want to.

Wait — the contract **gives you an extra 5 if you play A0**, so you’re incentivized to play A0.

But you can’t stop the other player from playing A1.

So yes, outcome is (A0, A1), you get 5.

But what if you don’t sign?

Then there’s no contract.

Then your payoff is as in the base game.

You can still get 10 if both play A0 — which is better.

You could also get 4 if both play A1 — worse.

But you can compete and possibly achieve (A0, A0), which is better than 5.

So is there any reason to sign?

Only if you think that **by signing, you can force a better outcome**.

But you can’t — because the other player still prefers A1, so they will play A1.

Therefore, signing the contract **locks you into a worse outcome**.

Unless...

Suppose you believe the other player **will not sign**, then the contract doesn’t activate.

But the contract is only active if both sign.

So if you sign and they don’t sign → no contract → base game.

But if you sign and they sign → contract is active → updated payoffs → still outcome (A0, A1) → you get 5.

So the only scenario where signing helps is if you believe:
- Other player **will sign**, and
- They will play A0

But as above, they have no incentive to play A0 — they prefer A1.

So their rational action is A1.

Therefore, probability they play A0 is 0 (under rationality).

So you get 5 for sure under contract.

If you don’t sign, then the game is base game, and you can potentially achieve (A0, A0) with 10.

So in the base game, your maximum guaranteed payoff is higher.

In fact, you can play A0 with high probability, and hope for coordination.

Even if rational expectations suggest (A0, A0) or (A1, A1), you could get 10 or 4.

But 10 is better than 5.

So unless you think the other player is going to be irrational, **signing is worse**.

But wait — perhaps you can use the contract to **induce mutual cooperation**?

Let’s check: if both sign, is (A0, A0) a Nash equilibrium?

Check:
- You play A0, they play A0: you get 15, they get 5
- You deviate to A1: you get 6 < 15 → don’t want to
- They deviate to A1: they get 15 > 5 → want to

So they want to deviate → not equilibrium.

So (A0, A0) is not an equilibrium under contract.

So you cannot compel cooperation.

You can only make yourself want A0 more, but they still want A1.

So outcome is locked at (A0, A1) if both sign.

Hence: signing leads to you getting **only 5**, while not signing allows a chance of **10**, which is better.

Therefore, **you should not sign the contract**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 3 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 13 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoffs with the contract

Let me recalculate all payoffs for me (Player 2) including the contract effects:

**Case 1: I choose A0, Other chooses A0**
- Base payoff: 10
- I get +3 for choosing A0 (from Other)
- I pay -3 because Other chose A0
- **Final: 10 + 3 - 3 = 10**

**Case 2: I choose A1, Other chooses A0**
- Base payoff: 20
- I pay -13 for choosing A1 (to Other)
- I pay -3 because Other chose A0
- **Final: 20 - 13 - 3 = 4**

**Case 3: I choose A0, Other chooses A1**
- Base payoff: 2
- I get +3 for choosing A0
- I get +13 because Other chose A1
- **Final: 2 + 3 + 13 = 18**

**Case 4: I choose A1, Other chooses A1**
- Base payoff: 4
- I pay -13 for choosing A1
- I get +13 because Other chose A1
- **Final: 4 - 13 + 13 = 4**

## Step 2: Construct my payoff matrix

```
                Other: A0    Other: A1
Me: A0             10           18
Me: A1              4            4
```

## Step 3: Analyze my best strategy

Comparing my options:
- If Other plays A0: I get 10 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If Other plays A1: I get 18 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - no matter what the other player does, I'm always better off choosing A0.

## Step 4: Determine optimal probability distribution

Since A0 dominates A1, my optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

**My payoffs (Player 1):**
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 0  
- (A1, A0): 6
- (A1, A1): 4

**Other player's payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 2
- (A1, A0): 20
- (A1, A1): 4

**Finding Nash equilibrium without contract:**
- For the other player: Playing A1 gives 20q + 4(1-q) = 16q + 4, while A0 gives 10q + 2(1-q) = 8q + 2. A1 strictly dominates A0.
- Since the other player will always choose A1, my best response is A1 (getting 4 vs 0).
- **Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1) → both get 4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds:
- +10 points to any player who chooses A0 (paid by the other player)
- -10 points to any player whose opponent chooses A0

**My modified payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 - 10 = 10
- (A0, A1): 0 + 10 - 0 = 10
- (A1, A0): 6 + 0 - 10 = -4
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4

**Other player's modified payoffs:**
- (A0, A0): 10 + 10 - 10 = 10
- (A1, A0): 20 + 0 - 10 = 10
- (A0, A1): 2 + 10 - 0 = 12
- (A1, A1): 4 + 0 - 0 = 4

**Finding Nash equilibrium with contract:**
- For me: A0 strictly dominates A1 (I get 10 either way with A0, vs max 4 with A1)
- For the other player: If I play A0, they get 10 with either action (indifferent, but could prefer A0)
- **Nash equilibrium: (A0, A0) → both get 10 points**

## Step 3: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** 4 points for me
- **With contract:** 10 points for me

The contract increases my expected payoff from 4 to 10 points, and similarly benefits the other player. This is a clear improvement.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)**

We are in a two-player simultaneous move game. Each player chooses between A0 and A1 with some probability.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Points | Opponent's Points |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 10          | 10                |
| A0          | A1                | 0           | 20                |
| A1          | A0                | 6           | 2                 |
| A1          | A1                | 4           | 4                 |

This is a coordination game with asymmetric payoffs.

Let’s analyze the best responses.

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria?

- If you play A0:
  - Opponent prefers A0 (10 > 20? No → 10 < 20) → so opponent prefers A1 if you play A0.
  - Wait: If **you** play A0, opponent gets 10 (if A0) vs 20 (if A1) → so opponent **prefers A1**.
- If you play A1:
  - Opponent gets 2 (if A0) vs 4 (if A1) → so prefers A1.

So no incentive for opponent to play A0 if you play A0 (they prefer A1), and if you play A1, they prefer A1.

But what if opponent plays A0?
- You get 10 (if A0) vs 6 (if A1) → prefer A0.
So:
- If opponent plays A0 → you prefer A0.
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A1.

So your best response depends on opponent.

Similarly, opponent’s best responses:
- If you play A0 → opponent gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1.
- If you play A1 → opponent gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1.

So **opponent always prefers A1**, regardless of your action.

So: **Best response for Player 2 (opponent) is always A1.**

Now, given that, what is your best response?

- If you play A0 → you get 0.
- If you play A1 → you get 4.

So you prefer A1.

So **(A1, A1)** is a Nash equilibrium.

But is it the only one?

Suppose you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 10, opponent gets 10.

But if opponent deviates to A1 → opponent gets 20 > 10 → so not stable.

Similarly, (A0, A0) is not a Nash equilibrium because opponent can profitably deviate.

(A0, A1): you get 0, opponent gets 20.
- You want to play A1 instead (get 4 > 0).
- Opponent: if you play A1, they get 4 > 2 (if A0), so still prefer A1.

So (A0, A1) is not stable.

(A1, A0): you get 6, opponent gets 2.
- Opponent wants to switch to A1 → gets 4 > 2.
- So not stable.

(A1, A1): both get 4.
- You: if switch to A0 → get 0 < 4 → no incentive.
- Opponent: same → no incentive.

So only **(A1, A1)** is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

But since opponent always best responds to A1, and you get 4 in that case, which is better than 0 or 6 (only if opponent plays A0), but since opponent won’t play A0, you are forced to expect A1.

Thus, **in the absence of contract, you should expect (A1, A1)** → you get 4.

Alternatively, if there is a chance opponent plays A0, you might want to play A0.

But since opponent will never play A0 (strictly dominated: A1 dominates A0 for them — always better), they will never play A0.

So without the contract, **your optimal strategy is to play A1**, expected payoff = 4.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract (proposed by Player 2, needs approval from both):

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get +11 points.
- This 11 is drawn equally from the other player → meaning: **the other player loses 11 points**.

Note: "drawn equally from the other players" — since only two players, so each player takes 5.5? But that doesn’t make sense.

Wait: the phrasing is ambiguous, but likely means: the 11 points awarded to the player choosing A0 are taken from the other player.

> "drawn equally from the other players" — plural, but there is only one other player.

So "equally" just means the entire 11 is taken from the other player.

Interpretation: When a player chooses A0, **they get +11**, and the **opponent loses 11 points** (i.e., the 11 is subtracted from the opponent’s payoff).

Important: this happens **regardless of the other player’s action** — only based on your action.

Also: **A1 → no additional payment.**

So:

#### New payoffs (with contract, if signed by both)

We assume the contract is active **only if both sign it**.

We are deciding whether to sign. Player 2 has proposed it.

So, if we sign → both players are bound by the contract.

Now, we must recompute the new payoffs.

Recall: the contract modifies the **base payoffs**.

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix**.

Base payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

| P1 \ P2 | A0         | A1         |
|---------|------------|------------|
| A0      | (10, 10)   | (0, 20)    |
| A1      | (6, 2)     | (4, 4)     |

Now, apply contract effect:
- If a player chooses A0 → they get +11, opponent loses 11.

So we adjust each outcome.

#### Case 1: Both play A0 → (A0, A0)
- Each plays A0 → each gets +11
- But also, each is the "other" for the other → so each loses 11 to the other?
- Wait: the contract says: "if a player chooses A0, they receive +11, drawn equally from the other players."

But "drawn equally from the other players" → in a two-player game, "other players" is one person → so entire 11 is taken from that one player.

So when **P1 plays A0**, P1 gets +11, P2 loses 11.
When **P2 plays A0**, P2 gets +11, P1 loses 11.

So when **both play A0**, the effects **add up**:

- P1: +11 (for playing A0), but -11 (because P2 played A0) → net 0
- P2: +11 (for playing A0), but -11 (because P1 played A0) → net 0

So total: (0, 0) in contract adjustments.

Base: (10, 10)
After contract: (10 + 0, 10 + 0) = (10, 10)

Wait: but each player gets +11 (for their own action), but loses 11 (for the other player’s action). So net 0 from contract.

So final payoffs: (10, 10)

#### Case 2: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1

- P1 plays A0 → gets +11
- P2 plays A1 → no gain or loss

But P1’s +11 comes from P2 (the other player) → so P2 loses 11

So:
- P1: base 0 + 11 = 11
- P2: base 20 - 11 = 9

→ (11, 9)

#### Case 3: P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0

- P1 plays A1 → no contract change
- P2 plays A0 → gets +11, and P1 loses 11

P1: base 6 - 11 = -5  
P2: base 2 + 11 = 13

→ (-5, 13)

#### Case 4: Both play A1

- No one plays A0 → so no contract changes

- Payoffs unchanged: (4, 4)

---

### **So new payoff matrix (with contract)**

| P1 \ P2 | A0         | A1         |
|---------|------------|------------|
| A0      | (10, 10)   | (11, 9)    |
| A1      | (-5, 13)   | (4, 4)     |

---

### **Step 3: Analyze game with contract**

Now, we need to see if this makes it better or worse for **Player 1** to sign the contract.

We are deciding: should we sign it?

Note: the contract only takes effect if **both** sign it. So if we **don’t sign**, it doesn’t apply.

So we have two scenarios:

- **If we sign** → contract applies → game becomes as above → we play with new payoffs.
- **If we don’t sign** → contract does not apply → we play original game.

We need to compute **expected payoff** under optimal play in both cases, and compare.

---

### **Case 1: We do not sign**

Game remains the original:

| P1 \ P2 | A0         | A1         |
|---------|------------|------------|
| A0      | (10, 10)   | (0, 20)    |
| A1      | (6, 2)     | (4, 4)     |

As before, **Player 2 has a dominant strategy: A1** (always gets more: 20 > 10 when P1 plays A0; 4 > 2 when P1 plays A1)

So P2 will play A1.

Then, P1’s best response:
- A0: 0 points
- A1: 4 points → better

So P1 plays A1 → outcome: (A1, A1), you get **4 points**

So expected payoff if we **do not sign**: **4**

---

### **Case 2: We sign the contract**

Now the game is:

| P1 \ P2 | A0         | A1         |
|---------|------------|------------|
| A0      | (10, 10)   | (11, 9)    |
| A1      | (-5, 13)   | (4, 4)     |

Now, let’s find Nash equilibrium.

#### First: Check if Player 2 has a dominant strategy?

- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 9 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 13 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P2 has a dominant strategy: A0**

Therefore, no matter what P1 does, P2 will play A0.

Now, given that P2 plays A0, what should P1 do?

- If P1 plays A0 → gets 10
- If P1 plays A1 → gets -5

So P1 prefers A0 (10 > -5)

Therefore, **equilibrium: (A0, A0)** → payoffs: (10, 10)

So if we sign the contract, the outcome is **(A0, A0)**, and we get **10 points**

---

### **Compare:**

- **If we sign**: we get **10 points**
- **If we do not sign**: we get **4 points**

So **signing is better**.

But wait: is this the only equilibrium?

We found (A0, A0) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.

Are there others?

- Suppose P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0: P2 gets 13 > 4, so wants to stick with A0.
P1 gets -5; if P1 switches to A0 → gets 10 > -5 → wants to deviate.

So (A1, A0) is not equilibrium.

- (A0, A1): P2 gets 9; if switches to A0 → gets 10 > 9 → wants to deviate.

- (A1, A1): P2 gets 4; if switches to A0 → gets 13 > 4 → wants to deviate.

So **only (A0, A0)** is pure-strategy NE.

But what about mixed strategies?

Let’s suppose P2 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with 1-p.

But we already know that **A0 is strictly dominant for P2** → so p = 1 is best.

Similarly, no mixed strategy can be better.

So **P2 will play A0 with probability 1**.

Then P1, given that, chooses A0 (10 > -5).

So outcome is deterministic: (A0, A0), you get 10.

---

### **Wait: is there any risk?**

Player 2 might not play A0? But with contract, A0 is strictly dominant.

So they **must** play A0.

So no risk.

Thus, if we sign, we **guarantee** 10 points.

If we don’t sign, we only get 4.

So **signing is better**.

But why does Player 2 propose this contract?

Let’s check: Player 2’s payoff.

Without contract: they get 4 (in equilibrium).

With contract: if contract signed, they get 10 (in (A0, A0)).

So Player 2 is also better off.

So both players benefit from the contract.

In fact, it **induces** cooperation in the sense that both want to play A0.

Without contract: (A1, A1) with 4 each.

With contract: (A0, A0) with 10 each.

So both benefit.

Thus, the contract is a **Pareto-improving mechanism**.

Therefore, **you should sign**.

On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, we first analyze the adjusted payoff matrix after accounting for the payment contract. The contract adds 5 points to any player who chooses action **A0**, which is subtracted from the other player.

**1. Adjusting the Payoffs:**
We evaluate the four possible outcomes based on the provided descriptions:
*   **Both choose A0:** Both get 10 points. Adjustments: Each receives 5 and pays 5. Net: **10 points each**.
*   **Player 1 (Other) chooses A0, Player 2 (You) chooses A1:** Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 20. Adjustments: Player 1 receives 5 from Player 2. Net: **Player 1 gets 5, Player 2 gets 15**.
*   **Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:** Player 1 gets 6, Player 2 gets 2. Adjustments: Player 2 receives 5 from Player 1. Net: **Player 1 gets 1, Player 2 gets 7**.
*   **Both choose A1:** Both get 4 points. Adjustments: None. Net: **4 points each**.

**2. Identifying the Dominant Strategy for Player 1:**
*   If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 compares 10 (A0) to 1 (A1).
*   If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 compares 5 (A0) to 4 (A1).
In both scenarios, action **A0** is the dominant strategy for Player 1, as it always yields a higher payoff regardless of Player 2's choice.

**3. Determining the Best Response for Player 2:**
Given that Player 1 is incentivized to play A0, Player 2 must choose the best response to A0:
*   Playing A0 results in 10 points.
*   Playing A1 results in 15 points.
Comparing these, choosing **A1** provides the maximum payoff for Player 2. The Nash Equilibrium of this game under the provided contract is for Player 1 to choose A0 and Player 2 to choose A1.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 3 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 13 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game, with two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses an action: A0 or A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

| Your Action \ Opponent’s Action | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | (10, 10)   | (0, 20)    |
| **A1**                        | (6, 2)     | (4, 4)     |

We are Player 1. Our actions affect both our own points and the opponent’s.

Let’s compute best responses and look for equilibria.

#### **Best Response Analysis**

- Suppose Player 2 plays A0:
  - If I play A0 → 10
  - If I play A1 → 6
  - So I prefer A0

- Suppose Player 2 plays A1:
  - If I play A0 → 0
  - If I play A1 → 4
  - So I prefer A1

So:
- My best response to A0 is A0
- My best response to A1 is A1

Player 2’s payoffs are:
| Your Action \ Opponent’s Action | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | (10, 10)   | (20, 0)    |
| **A1**                        | (2, 6)     | (4, 4)     |

So Player 2:
- Best response to A0: A0 (10 > 2)
- Best response to A1: A1 (4 > 0)

So Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both best respond → (10,10)
- (A1, A1): both best respond → (4,4)

There is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium with mixed actions unless someone is indifferent.

But we can now consider mixed strategies.

Let’s suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with 1−p.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10p + 0(1−p) = 10p
- A1: 6p + 4(1−p) = 6p + 4 − 4p = 2p + 4

Set equal for indifference:
10p = 2p + 4 → 8p = 4 → p = 0.5

Similarly, suppose Player 1 plays A0 with q, A1 with 1−q.

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- A0: 10q + 2(1−q) = 10q + 2 − 2q = 8q + 2
- A1: 20q + 4(1−q) = 20q + 4 − 4q = 16q + 4

Set equal:
8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → -8q = 2 → q = -0.25 → not valid

So there's no q that makes Player 2 indifferent. That means Player 2 never mixes in equilibrium.

Instead:
- If Player 1 plays A0 with q < 1, then Player 2 prefers A0 if 8q+2 > 16q+4? Let's test:

Wait — we can just analyze: when is Player 2 indifferent?

But since q ∈ [0,1], let's see when 8q + 2 > 16q + 4?
8q + 2 > 16q + 4 → -8q > 2 → q < -0.25 → never true.

So 8q + 2 < 16q + 4 for all q ∈ [0,1] → Player 2 always prefers A1.

Wait! Wait a second — that can’t be right.

Let’s recalculate:

Player 2’s payoff when playing:
- A0: if Player 1 plays A0 (prob q), payoff is 10; if A1 (1−q), payoff is 2 → so: **10q + 2(1−q) = 8q + 2**
- A1: if Player 1 plays A0 → 0; if A1 → 4 → so: **0*q + 4*(1−q) = 4(1−q)**

Ah! I made a mistake earlier.

Correct:
- A1 for Player 2: when opponent plays A0 → payoff is 0 (from (A0,A1): (0,20)), but wait:
  - If I play A1, and you play A0 → we are in (A1,A0): Player 2 gets 2
  - If I play A1, and you play A1 → (A1,A1): Player 2 gets 4

So yes: if I (Player 2) play A1:
- Against your A0: I get 2
- Against your A1: I get 4

So expected payoff for Player 2 from A1: 2q + 4(1−q) = 2q + 4 − 4q = -2q + 4

From A0: 10q + 2(1−q) = 10q + 2 − 2q = 8q + 2

Compare:
- A0: 8q + 2
- A1: -2q + 4

Set equal:
8q + 2 = -2q + 4 → 10q = 2 → q = 0.2

So Player 2 is indifferent at q = 0.2

Now, Player 1’s best response to Player 2’s mixed strategy:
We already did: expected payoff for A0: 10p
For A1: 6p + 4(1−p) = 2p + 4

Set equal: 10p = 2p + 4 → p = 0.5

So the only mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is:
- Player 1: plays A0 with q = 0.2
- Player 2: plays A0 with p = 0.5

Now compute expected payoffs:

Player 1:
- With prob 0.2: A0; with prob 0.8: A1
- But since actions depend on the mix, we need to compute expected payoff for Player 1.

Wait — no, we have:
- Player 1 plays A0 with q = 0.2, A1 with 0.8
- Player 2 plays A0 with p = 0.5, A1 with 0.5

So Joint probabilities:

| Action | Prob | P1 Payoff |
|--------|------|-----------|
| A0,A0 | 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 | 10 |
| A0,A1 | 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 | 0 |
| A1,A0 | 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 | 6 |
| A1,A1 | 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 | 4 |

Expected payoff for Player 1:
0.1×10 + 0.1×0 + 0.4×6 + 0.4×4 = 1 + 0 + 2.4 + 1.6 = **5.0**

Player 2: (check for completeness)
0.1×10 + 0.1×20 + 0.4×2 + 0.4×4 = 1 + 2 + 0.8 + 1.6 = **5.4**

But we don’t need this now.

Now, pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): (10,10) → both play pure A0
- (A1, A1): (4,4)

So the game has multiple equilibria: (A0,A0) best for both; (A1,A1) worse for both.

But (A0,A0) is Pareto efficient.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism**

There is a **payment contract** that can be put in place **if both players approve it via an approval voting process**.

- A contract specifies **additional payments** based on what a player chooses.
- The payment is **distributed equally among the other players**.

So:
- If you play A0, and the contract says “you pay 1 point”, that means you lose 1 point, and the other player(s) gain 1 point (shared equally).
- If a player chooses A0 and gets 3 points, that means 3 points are taken from the other player(s) and given to them.

Important: **the payments are in addition to the base game payoffs**.

Also, the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if multiple contracts tie for most approvals, one is chosen at random.

But **your goal is to maximize your total expected points**. So you must decide which contracts **you approve of**, assuming that the final contract will be one of the ones with max approvals (you can't control that), and you want to **maximize your expected payoff over all possible outcomes of the random selection from top-approved contracts**.

But since you are trying to **maximize your own points**, you should **approve only those contracts that, if they are selected (as one of the top-approved), give you higher expected payoff than not having any contract (or alternatives)**.

But here’s the twist: **you are not choosing the contract — you’re voting**.

And the process:
- Each contract is approved or not by each player.
- Then, we take the contracts with the **most approvals**.
- One is chosen uniformly at random from that set.
- Then, that contract is implemented.

So your **expected payoff** depends on:
- Which contracts get the most approvals → depends on your approval and others’ (but you control only your own).
- But others’ choices are unknown to you — so you must **strategically approve contracts** to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming the other player is rational (or plays optimally), but we are not told.

But since we are to **maximize our own points**, and we are only controlling our own votes, we must **evaluate each contract from our point of view**, assuming the other player will do what is best for them (i.e. they will vote based on their best interest), and then we need to **predict the outcome**.

But the problem says:
> "Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of."

And:
> "The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So in this setup, **you** are the only one whose behavior is under your control — and we assume the other player also tries to **maximize their own points**.

So we must **simultaneously decide**, as if in a game, what to approve.

But to solve this, **we can assume that the other player will also vote strategically** — and we need to find a consistent equilibrium in the approval voting stage.

Alternatively, since we are only making our own decisions, and the other player has the same incentive, we can **evaluate each contract from Player 1’s perspective**, and **determine if approving it is beneficial**, assuming Player 2 will behave rationally.

Let’s go contract by contract.

---

### **Contract Proposed by Player 1 (C1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So:
- If **you** play A0 → you pay 1 → net: base payoff minus 1
- If **you** play A1 → no additional cost
- **Other players** get +1 if you choose A0, split equally among others.

Since there are only two players, “equally among the other players”:
- If you play A0 → the **other player** gets +1
- If other plays A0 → you get +1

Let’s write the total net payoffs for Player 1 under this contract.

We denote total payoff = base payoff + additional payment (from contract).

Player 1's total payoff if:
- (A0, A0): base = 10, contract: you play A0 → pay 1 → you lose 1. Other player gets +1 → but that’s their gain, not yours.
  → So Player 1 gets: 10 − 1 = **9**
- (A0, A1): base = 0, you play A0 → pay 1 → so 0 − 1 = **−1**
- (A1, A0): base = 6, you play A1 → no payment → so 6 + 0 = **6**
- (A1, A1): base = 4, you play A1 → no payment → so **4**

So new payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

| Your A \ Opp A | A0      | A1      |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **A0**         | (9, 11) | (−1, 21) |
| **A1**         | (6, 3)  | (4, 5)  |

Explanation:
- (A0,A0): you: 10−1 = 9; other: 10 + 1 = 11
- (A0,A1): you: 0−1 = −1; other: 20 + 1 = 21
- (A1,A0): you: 6 + 0 = 6; other: 2 + 1 = 3
- (A1,A1): you: 4+0 = 4; other: 4+0 = 4

Now, **what will happen if this contract is implemented**?

Player 1's best responses:
- Opp A0: you get 9 vs 6 → prefer A0
- Opp A1: you get −1 vs 4 → prefer A1

So best response: A0 if opponent plays A0; A1 if opponent plays A1

Player 2's best responses:
- You play A0: player 2 gets 11 (A0) vs 21 (A1) → prefers A1
- You play A1: player 2 gets 3 (A0) vs 5 (A1) → prefers A1

So Player 2 always wants to play A1, regardless.

So if Player 2 plays A1 (in equilibrium), then Player 1 chooses A1.

Thus, **(A1, A1)** is the outcome if this contract is in effect.

Payoff: **Player 1 gets 4**

But in base game, without contract, (A1,A1) is possible: also gives 4.

But **in the base game, (A0,A0) is also an equilibrium with 10 points**.

The point of this contract: it makes playing A0 **costly** for the player, so it may push players toward A1.

But does it help Player 1?

In this contract, **if it's implemented**, the equilibrium is **(A1,A1)** → 4 points for you.

But **without any contract**, you could still get 10 if both coordinate on (A0,A0).

So **this contract deters A0**, and pushes you to get only 4.

But maybe **under this contract**, Player 2 **still invests in A1**, so you get 4.

So **your payoff under C1**: **4**

Compare to base game: you can get 10.

So **you do not want this contract** to be implemented.

But you're voting: do you **approve** C1?

Approval matters: if you approve C1, it might get more approvals → possibly win.

But C1 is **proposed by Player 1**, which is you.

So you can approve it.

But **your payoff if C1 is selected is 4**, which is **worse than 10**.

So **you should not want C1 to be selected**.

Therefore, **you should NOT approve C1**.

Even though it's your own proposal, you only approve if it benefits you.

So **C1: false**

---

### **Contract Proposed by Player 2 (C2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 3 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 13 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get +3 (from the other player)
- If you play A1 → you pay −13 (you lose 13; other player gains +13)

Now, let's compute total payoff for **Player 1** under C2.

#### Base payoffs + contract effects.

Player 1 payoff:

- (A0,A0): base 10 + 3 (because you play A0) = **13**, other gets −3
- (A0,A1): base 0 + 3 = **3**
- (A1,A0): base 6 + (−13) = **−7** (because you play A1 → pay 13)
- (A1,A1): base 4 + (−13) = **−9**

Now, payoffs for Player 2:

- (A0,A0): base 10, gets −3 → 7
- (A0,A1): base 20, gets −3 → 17
- (A1,A0): base 2, gets +13 → 15
- (A1,A1): base 4, gets +13 → 17

So full matrix:

| Your A \ Opp A | A0      | A1      |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **A0**         | (13, 7) | (3, 17) |
| **A1**         | (-7, 15)| (-9, 17)|

Now, analyze best responses.

**Player 1**:
- Opp A0: 13 (A0) vs −7 (A1) → prefer A0
- Opp A1: 3 (A0) vs −9 (A1) → prefer A0

So **Player 1 always wants to play A0**, regardless of opponent.

**Player 2**:
- You play A0: gets 7 (A0) vs 17 (A1) → prefers A1
- You play A1: gets 15 (A0) vs 17 (A1) → prefers A1

So Player 2 always plays A1.

Thus, if C2 is in effect, equilibrium is **(A0, A1)** → Player 1 gets **3**.

Is that better than base game?

In base game, you could get 10 from (A0,A0), or 4 from (A1,A1)

3 is **less than 10**, but better than 4.

But **3 is less than 10**, so it’s worse than the best outcome.

But under C2, **you are forced to get 3**, because Player 2 will play A1 no matter what, and you will play A0.

So **your payoff under C2: 3**

Now, compare to base game: **you can get 10**, so 3 < 10

So you do **not want C2 to be implemented**.

Therefore, **you should not approve C2**.

But wait — **is this really the case**?

What if Player 1 **could use a contract** to discourage Player 2 from playing A1?

But here, C2 makes it extremely costly to play A1.

But Player 2 still prefers A1? Let's check again.

In **C2**, if Player 1 plays A0 → Player 2’s best response is A1 (17 > 7)

If Player 1 plays A1 → Plant 2 gets 15 (A0) vs 17 (A1) → still prefers A1.

So yes, Player 2 always plays A1.

And Player 1, even if they play A0, get only 3.

So payoff: 3.

But earlier: without contract, you could get 10.

So **you do not want C2 to be implemented**.

So **C2: false**

But wait — could there be a way this contract helps?

No — because you get only 3.

But what if **you approve C2**, and **Player 2 does not**, then C2 isn't approved.

But we need to **evaluate whether approving C2 increases your expected payoff**.

So let’s **re-evaluate all contracts**.

Wait — but **C1 and C2 are the only two**.

We have to decide for both.

So far:
- C1: if implemented → you get 4
- C2: if implemented → you get 3

Both worse than 10.

But what if **no contract** is implemented?

Then the game proceeds with no extra payments.

In that case, **if both players coordinate on (A0,A0)**, you get 10.

But if they don't, you might get less.

But in decision-making, you have to **consider the outcome**.

But if **no contract is passed**, there’s no contract → base game.

So **what is your expected payoff if no contract is implemented**?

It depends on **what happens**.

But since no contract, it's just the base game.

Now, if players are rational, they may coordinate on (A0,A0) because it’s a Nash equilibrium and gives highest payoff.

But there’s also (A1,A1), and no guarantee of coordination.

But **(A0,A0)** is the **Pareto efficient** equilibrium, so likely.

In fact, **both players agree that (A0,A0) gives 10 each**, so it’s a natural focal point.

So if no contract, **you expect to get 10**.

But let’s suppose both players are rational and coordinated.

So **expected payoff without any contract: ~10**

Now, **if C1 is implemented**, you get only 4 → worse.

**If C2 is implemented**, you get 3 → worse.

So neither contract benefits you.

But **would you approve any contract**?

Only if it leads to **a better outcome**.

But both lead to worse.

But wait — **what if you** approve a contract that **makes the opponent want to play A0**, so you can get 10?

Let’s think differently.

### Is there a contract that can **induce the (A0,A0) outcome in equilibrium**, **with higher payoff than 10**?

No — because base (A0,A0) already gives 10.

But contracts **add payments**, so net could be more.

Wait — **C2 is proposed by Player 2**, and it gives you +3 if you play A0.

But it makes A1 very costly for you.

But if you play A0, and opponent plays A0, you get 10 + 3 = 13.

But if opponent plays A1, you get 0 + 3 = 3.

But opponent still plays A1.

But what if **you could use a contract that makes A1 very costly for the opponent**, so they prefer A0?

But **you don’t have such control** — contracts only apply to **your own actions**.

Let’s look back at **C2**:
- If a player chooses A0 → they get +3 (from the other player)
- If a player chooses A1 → they pay −13 (to the other player)

So **this contract strongly discourages A1**, rewards A0.

But in this contract, **you (Player 1) get +3 for A0**, but **must pay −13 for A1**.

So you prefer A0.

But again, opponent will always prefer A1.

So outcome: (A0, A1) → you get 3.

But what if **Player 2** is **willing to accept this**, because it makes them **receive money when you play A1**?

Yes — in fact, **Player 2 benefits** from your A1 (because they get +13), so they **want you to play A1**?

No — because if you play A1, and he plays A0, he gets 2 + 13 = 15

But if you play A1, he plays A1 → gets 4 + 13 = 17

So he prefers A1.

But incentive for him: he **doesn't care** about your action — he prefers A1 regardless.

But notice: **if you play A1**, Player 2 gets +13 → so he **gains** from your A1.

But he also increases his own action cost.

But from his perspective, his payoff from A1 is higher.

But **in C2**, Player 2 is **always better off playing A1**.

So he will.

So you get 3.

No escape.

---

### But now: what if **you approve C1**?

C1: you pay 1 for A0; no cost for A1.

So it makes A0 costlier.

You will play A1.

Opponent: if you play A1, they get:
- If they play A0: 2
- If they play A1: 4

So good, they prefer A1.

So (A1,A1) → you get 4

But under C1, you get 4.

But if **no contract**, you can get 10.

So **you lose**.

Similarly for C2.

So **neither contract increases your expected payoff**.

But what if **you vote for a contract that forces a better outcome**, but only if the other player approves?

Let’s think about the **approval process**:

- You vote **yes** or **no** on each contract.
- The contract with **most approvals** wins (randomly if tie).
- You want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

But you don’t know what the other player will do.

So you must assume the other player will vote to **maximize their own payoff**.

Let’s assume **Player 2** also is rational and wants to **maximize their own points**.

So let’s analyze **C1** from **Player 2’s** perspective.

#### What is Player 2’s payoff if C1 is implemented?

From earlier:

C1: if you play A0, you lose 1; opponent gains 1.

Player 2 payoff:
- (A0,A0): 10 +1 = 11
- (A0,A1): 20 +1 = 21
- (A1,A0): 2 +1 = 3  [you play A1, so no cost to you, so Player 2 gets +1 if you play A0]
- (A1,A1): 4 + 0 = 4

So matrix:

| P2's A \ P1's A | A0     | A1     |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| A0               | 11     | 3      |
| A1               | 21     | 4      |

So Player 2’s best responses:
- If P1 plays A0: 11 vs 21 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: 3 vs 4 → prefers A1

So Player 2 will always play A1.

P1 will play A1 if you (P1) play A1: base 6 vs 4 → but with C1: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 9 (but P1 loses 1) → 9 > 4 → but P1 gets 9 for A0, 4 for A1? No:

Wait — earlier:
Under C1:
- A0: 10−1 = 9
- A1: 4

So P1 prefers A0.

But P2 plays A1.

So outcome: (A0,A1) → P1 gets 9−1 = −1? No:

Wait — correction:

In (A0,A1):
- P1 plays A0: base 0, pays 1 → gets **-1**
- P2 plays A1: base 20, gets +1 → 21

So P1 gets −1.

But P1 wants to avoid that.

But if P1 plays A1: gets 4

So P1 between −1 and 4 → prefers A1.

But holds only if P2 plays A1.

But if P1 plays A0, and P2 plays A1 → −1

If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1 → 4

So P1 prefers A1.

But P2 always prefers A1.

So equilibrium is (A1,A1) → P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4

But for P1, 4 < 10, so bad.

Now, **if P2 votes on C1**, what do they get?

If C1 is implemented: P2 gets 4

If not, in base game: P2 can get 10 from (A0,A0)

So P2 gets 4 < 10 → so **P2 will not approve C1**

Similarly, **you (P1)** get 4 < 10 → so you won't approve C1

Now C2:

C2: A0 gives +3, A1 gives −13

P1 payoff: (A0,A0): 10+3=13; (A0,A1):0+3=3; (A1,A0):6−13=−7; (A1,A1):4−13=−9

P1 always wants A0.

P2: wants A1 always.

So outcome: (A0,A1) → P1 gets 3

But in base game, P1 can get 10 → so P1 does not want C2

Now, what does P2 get under C2?

P2 payoff:
- (A0,A0): 10 −3 = 7
- (A0,A1): 20 −3 = 17
- (A1,A0): 2 +13 = 15
- (A1,A1): 4 +13 = 17

So P2 gets 17 in (A0,A1) and (A1,A1)

But P2 plays A1 regardless.

So P2 gets 17 → better than 10

So P2 **wants C2**! Because they can get 17 > 10

So **Player 2 will approve C2**.

But you (P1) get only 3 < 10 → so you **do not want C2**

But: what if **you approve C2**?

Then both approve → C2 has 2 approvals

C1: if you don't approve, and P2 doesn't approve, C1 has 0

So C2 wins

Then you get 3

But if you **don't approve C2**, then C2 has 1 approval (only P2), C1 has 0 (if you don't approve), so winning contract has 1 approval.

But if **only C2 has approvals**, then C2 is selected.

But if **you do not approve C2**, then C2 has only 1 approval (P2's)

C1: you don't approve, P2 may not — assume P2 doesn't approve C1 → then C1 has 0

Then the set of contracts with max approvals is {C2} with 1 approval

So C2 is selected → you get 3

But if **you approve C2**, then C2 has 2 approvals → still selected → you get 3

So **either way, you get 3 if C2 is selected**

But is there a case where C2 is not selected?

Only if **neither contract** has any approval — but P2 will approve C2, so C2 has at least 1 approval.

C1: if you approve, it has 1 (you); if not, 0

But if you approve C1, it has 1, C2 has 2 → C2 selected

So **C2 wins no matter what, as long as P2 approves**, which they will.

Because P2 gets 17 > 10

So C2 will be selected with probability 1.

So **your expected payoff is 3**, regardless of whether you approve C2.

But if you don't approve C2, you get 3
If you do approve C2, you get 3

So **indifferent**

But is there a way to get better than 3?

No.

But worse: if you approve a contract that’s not selected, you don’t hurt yourself — but you might help if it blocks a worse contract.

But the only contracts are C1 and C2.

C1 gives you only 4, which is better than 3, but only if it’s selected.

But if you approve C1, C1 gets 1 approval, C2 gets 2 (P2 approves) → so C2 wins → you get 3

Same as before.

If you don’t approve C1, C1 has 0, C2 wins → 3

So **in all cases, C2 wins and you get 3**

Because P2 will approve C2, and C2 has 2 approvals if you do, or 1 if you don’t.

But max approvals is 2 → but only if you approve.

But if you don’t approve, C2 has only 1, C1 has 0 → so max is 1 → C2 selected.

So C2 is selected, you get 3.

So **your payoff is 3 no matter what you do**.

But is there a possibility that no contract is selected?

Only if no one approves any contract.

But P2 will approve C2 → C2 has at least 1 approval → so at least one contract has approvals → so highest is at least 1.

So a contract is selected.

So **you are guaranteed to get 3 points**, regardless of your vote.

But wait — is that true?

Suppose **you approve C2**, and P2 approves C2 → C2 has 2 approvals.

C1 has 0.

So max approvals = 2 → C2 is selected → you get 3.

If you **do not approve C2**, then C2 has 1 approval, C1 has 0 → max is 1 → C2 selected → you get 3.

So in both cases, you get 3.

So **you are indifferent**.

But can you do better?

Only if you could prevent C2 and somehow get a better outcome.

But there's no other contract.

Perhaps **if you approve C1 and disapprove C2**, then C2 has 1, C1 has 1 → both have 1 approval → so both are in the set of winning contracts → then random selection: with 50% chance C1 selected, 50% C2.

Then your **expected payoff**:

- 50%: C1 → you get 4
- 50%: C2 → you get 3

Expected: (4 + 3)/2 = 3.5

Ah! **Better than 3**

So if you **approve C1 but not C2**, then:
- C1: you approve
- C2: you disapprove
- P2 approves C2, not C1 (since we assume P2 only approves C2)

So approvals: C1: 1 (you), C2: 1 (P2)

So both have 1 approval → both are winning candidates → one is chosen uniformly at random.

Then you get:
- 50% chance C1: you get 4
- 50% chance C2: you get 3
- Expected: **3.5**

If you approve C2, you get 3.

If you approve only C2, you get 3.

If you approve only C1, you get 3.5.

If you approve both, C2 has 2, C1 has 1 → C2 wins → you get 3.

If you approve neither, C2 has 1, C1 has 0 → C2 wins → you get 3.

So **maximum expected payoff is 3.5**, achieved **only if you approve C1 and not C2**.

Is this rational for Player 2?

Player 2 approves C2 → they want it.

But they will not approve C1, because under C1, they get only 4, and in base game can get 10, so they won't.

So yes.

So best response for **you** is to **approve C1**, **not C2**, to make it a tie, and get 3.5 expected.

Because if you approve C1, and disapprove C2, then:
- C1: 1 approval (you)
- C2: 1 approval (P2)
- Both tied at max approvals = 1
- Winner: uniform random

Your expected payoff: (4 + 3)/2 = 3.5

Otherwise, you get 3

So you should **approve C1, not C2**

But earlier I thought not, but now we see a way to **leverage the tie** to increase expected payoff.

So final answer:

- C1: **true** (approve)
- C2: **false** (do not approve)

But wait — is there a problem?

When you approve C1, does it make P2 more likely to approve something else? No — P2 only approves C2.

So yes.

Therefore, **your best strategy is to approve C1 and not approve C2**, to force a tie and get expected 3.5.

If you approve C2, you get only 3.

So **you should approve C1, disapprove C2**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry


Your previous response was:
Let's go through this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without contracts)**

We are Player 1. Our actions: A0 or A1.  
The other player (Player 2) chooses A0 or A1 simultaneously.  
The payoff matrix (for Player 1, then Player 2) is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10 | 0, 20  |
| **P1: A1**    | 6, 2   | 4, 4   |

This is a classic asymmetric coordination game.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze best responses and Nash equilibria in the original game**

Let’s find the pure strategy Nash equilibria.

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1’s best response: A0 (10 > 6)
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1’s best response: A1 (4 > 0)

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2’s best response: A0 (10 > 20? No — 20 > 10) → wait: P2 gets 20 if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1 → so P2 prefers A1.
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2’s best response: A1 (4 > 2)

So:
- (A0, A0): P1 is happy (10 > 6), but P2 is not (20 > 10), so P2 wants to deviate → not NE
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, but prefers A1 (4 > 0) → P1 deviates → not NE
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 6, prefers A0? 10 > 6 → P1 deviates → not NE
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4. If P1 deviates to A0 → gets 0 < 4 → won’t deviate. If P2 deviates to A0 → gets 2 < 4 → won’t deviate. → **This is a Nash equilibrium**

So the only **pure strategy Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1), giving each player 4 points.

There may be mixed strategies, but since we’re evaluating contracts and voting, we need to think about expected payoffs under possible outcomes — especially how contracts change incentives.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the contracts**

Each contract adds a **transfer** based on the action chosen.

Let’s break down both contracts.

---

### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:
- If you play A0 → you lose 1 point **in addition to the original payoff**.  
- If you play A1 → no extra cost.
- The "distributed equally among the other players" — since there are **two players**, each other player gets 0.5 of the 1-point penalty.
  - But wait: "distributed equally among the other players" → so if **you** play A0, you lose 1 point, and **the other player** gains 1 point.
    - Because only one other player → so **you lose 1**, **the other gains 1**.
    - So it's a one-way transfer from the A0 player to the other player.

So net effect for **Player 1**:
- If Player 1 plays A0: **1 point deducted** from their payoff.
- If Player 1 plays A1: no change.

Similarly, for **Player 2**:
- If Player 2 plays A0: **1 point deducted** from their payoff.

So if both play A0: P1 gets 10 - 1 = 9, P2 gets 10 - 1 = 9
- But P1 pays 1 → P2 gets it → so 10 + 1 = 11? No.

Wait — **Clarify**: does “pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed among the other players” mean:
- The player chooses A0 → they pay 1 point to the other player?

Yes, that’s the natural interpretation.

So **A0 player loses 1 point, the other player gains 1 point** — but only if **they** played A0.

So:
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 loses 1, P2 gains 1 (if P2 played something? No — it's independent.)
Wait — the payment is **made by the player who chooses A0**, and **goes to the other player**, regardless of what the other does.

But “distributed equally among the other players” — only one other player → so **that player gets the full 1 point**.

So yes: **Each player who plays A0 pays 1 point to the other player**.

So:
- If both play A0: P1 loses 1, P2 loses 1 → P1 total = 10 - 1 = 9, P2 total = 10 - 1 = 9
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1: P1 pays 1 → gets 0 - 1 = -1, P2 gets +1 → 20 + 1 = 21
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0: P1 gets 6, P2 pays 1 → gets 2 - 1 = 1
- If both play A1: no cost → both get 4

So modified payoff matrix (C1 applied):

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 9, 9         | -1, 21        |
| **P1: A1**    | 6, 1         | 4, 4          |

---

### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payments
> - If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If you play A1 → you pay 5 points → goes to the other player → other player gains 5
- If you play A0 → no transfer

So:
- If P1 plays A1 → P1 loses 5, P2 gains 5
- If P2 plays A1 → P2 loses 5, P1 gains 5

So let’s write the new payoff matrix (C2):

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 0, 20 + 5 = 25 |
| **P1: A1**    | 6 + 5 = 11, 2 | 4 + 5 = 9, 4 - 5 = -1 |

Explanation:
- (A0, A0): no cost → (10, 10)
- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 5 → P1 gains 5 → so P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5? Wait, original is 0? No:

Wait — original payoff: when P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1 → P1 gets 0, P2 gets 20.

Now: P2 chooses A1 → so P2 pays 5 → so P2 gets 20 - 5 = 15, and P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5.

Similarly:
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → pays 5 → P1 gets 6 - 5 = 1, P2 gets 2 + 5 = 7
- (A1, A1): both pay 5 → P1 gets 4 - 5 = -1, P2 gets 4 - 5 = -1

Wait — but “distributed equally among the other players” — if both play A1, then each pays 5 to the other → P1 loses 5 to P2, P2 loses 5 to P1 → net zero?

Yes — so **each player pays 5, and receives 5 from the other player** → they end up with their original payoff.

But let’s be careful.

> If a player chooses A1, they pay 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.

With two players, “distribute among other players” → the other player gets 5.

So if **only P2 plays A1**: P2 pays 5 → goes to P1 → so P2 gets 20 - 5 = 15, P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5.

If **only P1 plays A1**: P1 pays 5 → goes to P2 → P1 gets 6 - 5 = 1, P2 gets 2 + 5 = 7.

If **both play A1**: each pays 5 → P1 loses 5, gains 5 → net 0 → so P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4 → original.

If **neither plays A1** → both A0 → neither pays → (10,10)

So revised payoff matrix (C2):

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 5, 15         |
| **P1: A1**    | 1, 7         | 4, 4          |

Wait — corrections:
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → no cost. P2 plays A1 → pays 5 → P1 gets +5, P2 gets -5 → so P1: 0 + 5 = 5, P2: 20 - 5 = 15 → yes
- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → pays 5 → P1: 6 - 5 = 1, P2: 2 + 5 = 7 → yes
- (A1, A1): both pay 5 → P1: 4 - 5 + 5 = 4, P2: 4 - 5 + 5 = 4 → so (4,4)
- (A0, A0): (10,10)

So yes.

So C2 payoff matrix:

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 5, 15         |
| **P1: A1**    | 1, 7         | 4, 4          |

---

### **Step 4: Analyze each contract from **Player 1’s** perspective**

We want to **maximize** our own expected payoff.

But **only contracts that are approved by a majority** can be enacted. The **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.**

However, we are only deciding **which contracts to approve** — we do **not** know how the other player votes.

But notice: the contract is **approved via voting**, and we must decide **which** contracts we want to support.

Since the final contract is selected at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**, we should **strategically approve contracts** so that we maximize our **expected payoff**, considering:
- Our approval affects the number of approvals each contract gets
- We cannot control the other player’s vote
- The winning contract is the one with **maximum approvals**, chosen uniformly at random among those with that max

So we should **only approve contracts that we believe will maximize our expected payoff**, given uncertainty about the other player’s vote.

But to be safe, let’s assume the other player is rational and wants to maximize their payoff (as we do). We can simulate possible outcomes.

But since we are only choosing approvals, and the contract with **most approvals** wins (randomly if tied), we must choose whom to support.

Let’s suppose we **approve only** contracts that are **good for us** and **likely** to win.

But both contracts are proposed by the **opposing player**, so they might be biased.

But we are only concerned with **our own payoff**.

Let’s evaluate each contract **from our perspective (Player 1)**, in terms of **what our expected payoff would be if the contract is adopted**, and whether we think it’s **worth approving** to help it win.

But note: approving a contract only increases its approval count — so to make a contract more likely to be selected (or tie for highest), we should approve contracts that we like.

But we can approve both or only one.

Let’s compute the **expected payoff** under each contract, assuming both players play optimally.

Then we can see which contract gives us higher expected payoff.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze optimal play under each contract**

---

#### **Contract C1: C1 payoff matrix (Player 1’s perspective)**

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 9, 9         | -1, 21        |
| **P1: A1**    | 6, 1         | 4, 4          |

Let’s compute best responses.

Player 1:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 max is max(9,6) → A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 max is max(-1,4) → A1

Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0: P2’s payoffs: 9 vs 21 → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: P2’s payoffs: 1 vs 4 → prefers A1

So P2 always prefers A1? Let’s see.

From P2’s perspective:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 9 (if plays A0) or 21 (if plays A1) → so A1
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → A1

So **P2’s dominant strategy is A1**

Then P1, knowing P2 plays A1, will choose:
- A0: gets -1
- A1: gets 4 → so chooses A1

So **only Nash equilibrium in C1: (A1, A1)** → P1 gets 4

But let’s also check if there are other equilibria.

Suppose both play A1 → P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4 → P1 wouldn’t deviate to A0 (gets -1 < 4), P2 wouldn’t deviate (1 < 4) → yes, (A1, A1) is NE.

Is there a mixed strategy equilibrium?

Suppose P2 plays A0 with prob q, A1 with (1-q)

P1’s expected payoff:
- A0: q×9 + (1-q)×(-1) = 9q -1 + q = 10q -1
- A1: q×6 + (1-q)×4 = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4

Set equal: 10q -1 = 2q + 4 → 8q = 5 → q = 5/8

So if P2 plays A0 with 5/8, P1 is indifferent.

Now P1’s best response: if P2 plays q = 5/8, P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now from P2’s side: suppose P1 plays A0 with p, A1 with (1-p)

P2’s payoffs:
- A0: p×9 + (1-p)×1 = 9p + 1 - p = 8p + 1
- A1: p×21 + (1-p)×4 = 21p + 4 - 4p = 17p + 4

Set equal for indifference: 8p + 1 = 17p + 4 → 1 - 4 = 17p - 8p → -3 = 9p → p = -1/3 → impossible

So P2 **never** plays A0 in equilibrium — since even for low p, 17p + 4 > 8p + 1? Let’s plug p=0:
- A0: 1
- A1: 4 → better → so P2 always prefers A1

So in **any** Bayes-Nash equilibrium, P2 plays A1 with probability 1.

Then P1 plays A1 → gets 4

So **under C1, expected payoff for P1 is 4**

---

#### **Contract C2: C2 payoff matrix**

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 5, 15         |
| **P1: A1**    | 1, 7         | 4, 4          |

Now analyze.

P2’s best responses:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 7 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So P2’s best response depends on P1.

P1’s best responses:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P1 always prefers A0**?

Wait:
- P1: A0 → A0: 10, A1: 5 → so A0 better
- So **P1’s dominant strategy is A0**

Now P2: if P1 plays A0 → P2’s best response is A1

So in equilibrium: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → outcome is (A0, A1)

Payoff: P1 gets 5,

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in response 'Let\'s go through this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without contracts)**\n\nWe are Player 1. Our actions: A0 or A1.  \nThe other player (Player 2) chooses A0 or A1 simultaneously.  \nThe payoff matrix (for Player 1, then Player 2) is:\n\n|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10 | 0, 20  |\n| **P1: A1**    | 6, 2   | 4, 4   |\n\nThis is a classic asymmetric coordination game.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze best responses and Nash equilibria in the original game**\n\nLet’s find the pure strategy Nash equilibria.\n\n- If P2 plays A0:\n  - P1’s best response: A0 (10 > 6)\n- If P2 plays A1:\n  - P1’s best response: A1 (4 > 0)\n\n- If P1 plays A0:\n  - P2’s best response: A0 (10 > 20? No — 20 > 10) → wait: P2 gets 20 if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1 → so P2 prefers A1.\n- If P1 plays A1:\n  - P2’s best response: A1 (4 > 2)\n\nSo:\n- (A0, A0): P1 is happy (10 > 6), but P2 is not (20 > 10), so P2 wants to deviate → not NE\n- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, but prefers A1 (4 > 0) → P1 deviates → not NE\n- (A1, A0): P1 gets 6, prefers A0? 10 > 6 → P1 deviates → not NE\n- (A1, A1): P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4. If P1 deviates to A0 → gets 0 < 4 → won’t deviate. If P2 deviates to A0 → gets 2 < 4 → won’t deviate. → **This is a Nash equilibrium**\n\nSo the only **pure strategy Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1), giving each player 4 points.\n\nThere may be mixed strategies, but since we’re evaluating contracts and voting, we need to think about expected payoffs under possible outcomes — especially how contracts change incentives.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Understand the contracts**\n\nEach contract adds a **transfer** based on the action chosen.\n\nLet’s break down both contracts.\n\n---\n\n### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**\n\n> - If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.  \n> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0 → you lose 1 point **in addition to the original payoff**.  \n- If you play A1 → no extra cost.\n- The "distributed equally among the other players" — since there are **two players**, each other player gets 0.5 of the 1-point penalty.\n  - But wait: "distributed equally among the other players" → so if **you** play A0, you lose 1 point, and **the other player** gains 1 point.\n    - Because only one other player → so **you lose 1**, **the other gains 1**.\n    - So it\'s a one-way transfer from the A0 player to the other player.\n\nSo net effect for **Player 1**:\n- If Player 1 plays A0: **1 point deducted** from their payoff.\n- If Player 1 plays A1: no change.\n\nSimilarly, for **Player 2**:\n- If Player 2 plays A0: **1 point deducted** from their payoff.\n\nSo if both play A0: P1 gets 10 - 1 = 9, P2 gets 10 - 1 = 9\n- But P1 pays 1 → P2 gets it → so 10 + 1 = 11? No.\n\nWait — **Clarify**: does “pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed among the other players” mean:\n- The player chooses A0 → they pay 1 point to the other player?\n\nYes, that’s the natural interpretation.\n\nSo **A0 player loses 1 point, the other player gains 1 point** — but only if **they** played A0.\n\nSo:\n- If P1 plays A0 → P1 loses 1, P2 gains 1 (if P2 played something? No — it\'s independent.)\nWait — the payment is **made by the player who chooses A0**, and **goes to the other player**, regardless of what the other does.\n\nBut “distributed equally among the other players” — only one other player → so **that player gets the full 1 point**.\n\nSo yes: **Each player who plays A0 pays 1 point to the other player**.\n\nSo:\n- If both play A0: P1 loses 1, P2 loses 1 → P1 total = 10 - 1 = 9, P2 total = 10 - 1 = 9\n- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1: P1 pays 1 → gets 0 - 1 = -1, P2 gets +1 → 20 + 1 = 21\n- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0: P1 gets 6, P2 pays 1 → gets 2 - 1 = 1\n- If both play A1: no cost → both get 4\n\nSo modified payoff matrix (C1 applied):\n\n|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **P1: A0**    | 9, 9         | -1, 21        |\n| **P1: A1**    | 6, 1         | 4, 4          |\n\n---\n\n### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**\n\n> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payments\n> - If a player chooses A1: they pay an additional 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.\n\nSo:\n- If you play A1 → you pay 5 points → goes to the other player → other player gains 5\n- If you play A0 → no transfer\n\nSo:\n- If P1 plays A1 → P1 loses 5, P2 gains 5\n- If P2 plays A1 → P2 loses 5, P1 gains 5\n\nSo let’s write the new payoff matrix (C2):\n\n|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 0, 20 + 5 = 25 |\n| **P1: A1**    | 6 + 5 = 11, 2 | 4 + 5 = 9, 4 - 5 = -1 |\n\nExplanation:\n- (A0, A0): no cost → (10, 10)\n- (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 5 → P1 gains 5 → so P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5? Wait, original is 0? No:\n\nWait — original payoff: when P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1 → P1 gets 0, P2 gets 20.\n\nNow: P2 chooses A1 → so P2 pays 5 → so P2 gets 20 - 5 = 15, and P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nSimilarly:\n- (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → pays 5 → P1 gets 6 - 5 = 1, P2 gets 2 + 5 = 7\n- (A1, A1): both pay 5 → P1 gets 4 - 5 = -1, P2 gets 4 - 5 = -1\n\nWait — but “distributed equally among the other players” — if both play A1, then each pays 5 to the other → P1 loses 5 to P2, P2 loses 5 to P1 → net zero?\n\nYes — so **each player pays 5, and receives 5 from the other player** → they end up with their original payoff.\n\nBut let’s be careful.\n\n> If a player chooses A1, they pay 5 points, distributed equally among the other players.\n\nWith two players, “distribute among other players” → the other player gets 5.\n\nSo if **only P2 plays A1**: P2 pays 5 → goes to P1 → so P2 gets 20 - 5 = 15, P1 gets 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nIf **only P1 plays A1**: P1 pays 5 → goes to P2 → P1 gets 6 - 5 = 1, P2 gets 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nIf **both play A1**: each pays 5 → P1 loses 5, gains 5 → net 0 → so P1 gets 4, P2 gets 4 → original.\n\nIf **neither plays A1** → both A0 → neither pays → (10,10)\n\nSo revised payoff matrix (C2):\n\n|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 5, 15         |\n| **P1: A1**    | 1, 7         | 4, 4          |\n\nWait — corrections:\n- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → no cost.

We can simulate possible outcomes.\n\nBut since we are only choosing approvals, and the contract with **most approvals** wins (randomly if tied), we must choose whom to support.\n\nLet’s suppose we **approve only** contracts that are **good for us** and **likely** to win.\n\nBut both contracts are proposed by the **opposing player**, so they might be biased.\n\nBut we are only concerned with **our own payoff**.\n\nLet’s evaluate each contract **from our perspective (Player 1)**, in terms of **what our expected payoff would be if the contract is adopted**, and whether we think it’s **worth approving** to help it win.\n\nBut note: approving a contract only increases its approval count — so to make a contract more likely to be selected (or tie for highest), we should approve contracts that we like.\n\nBut we can approve both or only one.\n\nLet’s compute the **expected payoff** under each contract, assuming both players play optimally.\n\nThen we can see which contract gives us higher expected payoff.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Analyze optimal play under each contract**\n\n---\n\n#### **Contract C1: C1 payoff matrix (Player 1’s perspective)**\n\n|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **P1: A0**    | 9, 9         | -1, 21        |\n| **P1: A1**    | 6, 1         | 4, 4          |\n\nLet’s compute best responses.\n\nPlayer 1:\n- If P2 plays A0: P1 max is max(9,6) → A0\n- If P2 plays A1: P1 max is max(-1,4) → A1\n\nPlayer 2:\n- If P1 plays A0: P2’s payoffs: 9 vs 21 → prefers A1\n- If P1 plays A1: P2’s payoffs: 1 vs 4 → prefers A1\n\nSo P2 always prefers A1?

Let’s go through this step by step, carefully and clearly.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without contracts)**

We are Player 1. The payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10 | 0, 20  |
| **P1: A1**    | 6, 2   | 4, 4   |

This is a coordination game with asymmetric payoffs. The only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is **(A1, A1)**, where both get 4 points. Any other profile is unstable because at least one player wants to deviate.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contracts**

There are two contracts:

#### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**  
- If a player chooses **A0**, they pay **1 point**, which is **given entirely to the other player** (only one other player).
- If a player chooses **A1**, no payment.

So:
- Player 1 playing A0 → loses 1 point.
- Player 2 playing A0 → loses 1 point.
- The other player gains that 1 point.

Modified payoff matrix (C1):

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 9, 9         | -1, 21        |
| **P1: A1**    | 6, 1         | 4, 4          |

> (A0, A0): P1 gets 10–1=9, P2 gets 10–1=9  
> (A0, A1): P1 gets 0–1=–1, P2 gets 20+1=21  
> (A1, A0): P1 gets 6, P2 gets 2–1=1  
> (A1, A1): no changes → 4,4

**Analysis of C1:**
- Player 2's best response:  
  - If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 9 (A0) vs 21 (A1) → prefers A1  
  - If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1  
  → **P2 always prefers A1** (dominant strategy)

- Player 1, knowing P2 plays A1:  
  - P1 gets –1 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

→ **Only Nash equilibrium: (A1, A1)** → P1 gets **4**

So under C1, P1 gets **4 points**.

---

#### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**  
- If a player chooses **A1**, they pay **5 points**, which goes to the other player.
- If a player chooses **A0**, no payment.

So:
- Playing A1 → lose 5 points (net), and the other player gains 5.
- Playing A0 → no transfer.

Modified payoff matrix (C2):

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 10, 10       | 5, 15         |
| **P1: A1**    | 1, 7         | 4, 4          |

> (A0, A0): no cost → 10,10  
> (A0, A1): P2 plays A1 → pays 5 → P1 gets 0+5=5, P2 gets 20–5=15  
> (A1, A0): P1 plays A1 → pays 5 → P1 gets 6–5=1, P2 gets 2+5=7  
> (A1, A1): both pay 5 → P1 gets 4–5+5=4, P2 gets 4–5+5=4  
> → (4,4)

**Analysis of C2:**
- P1's best response:
  - If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefers A0
  - If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0
  → **P1's dominant strategy: A0**

- P2's best response:
  - If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → prefers A1
  - If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 7 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

→ **Best response depends on P1**

Now find Nash equilibrium:
- Suppose P1 plays A0 (dominant).
- Then P2 best response: A1
- Result: (A0, A1)
- Check deviations:
  - P1: gets 5; if switches to A1 → gets 1 < 5 → won’t deviate
  - P2: gets 15; if switches to A0 → gets 10 < 15 → won’t deviate

→ **Nash equilibrium: (A0, A1)** → P1 gets **5 points**

So under C2, P1 gets **5 points**

---

### **Step 3: Compare expected payoffs**

- If **C1** is enacted → P1 gets **4**
- If **C2** is enacted → P1 gets **5**

So **C2 is better for Player 1**.

But contracts are selected via approval voting:
- Each player approves some contracts.
- The contract(s) with the **highest number of approvals** are eligible.
- One is chosen **uniformly at random** from those with max approvals.

We are **Player 1**, and we want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

We must decide which contracts to approve.

But we **do not know** how Player 2 will vote.

However, we can assume Player 2 is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff.

So let’s analyze: What would Player 2 prefer?

#### **What does Player 2 get under each contract?**

- **C1**: P2 plays A1 (dominant), so (A1, A1) → P2 gets 4
- **C2**: in equilibrium, (A0, A1) → P2 gets 15

So **Player 2 strongly prefers C2 (15) over C1 (4)**

Therefore, **Player 2 will approve C2**, and will likely **not approve C1** (since it gives them only 4 vs 15).

Now, **we (Player 1)**: we get 4 under C1, 5 under C2.

So we **prefer C2**.

But:
- If we approve **both**, and Player 2 approves **only C2**, then:
  - C1: 1 approval
  - C2: 2 approvals → C2 wins → we get 5

- If we approve **only C2**, and Player 2 approves C2 → C2 has 2, C1 has 0 → C2 wins → we get 5

- If we approve **only C1**, and Player 2 approves C2 → C2 has 2, C1 has 1 → C2 wins → we get 5

- If we approve **neither**, then C1: 0, C2: 1 → C2 wins → we get 5

So **in all cases**, if Player 2 approves C2 (which they will, since it’s better for them), and we approve C2 (which we should), then C2 wins.

But if we **do not approve C2**, then:
- C2 has only 1 approval (from P2)
- C1 has 1 (from us) or 0
- So if we approve C1 only, C1 has 1, C2 has 1 → **tie** → winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance of C1 (we get 4), 50% chance of C2 (we get 5)
  → Expected payoff: (0.5)(4) + (0.5)(5) = **4.5**

But if we **approve C2**, then:
- C2 has 2 approvals (us + P2), C1 has 1 or 0 → C2 definitely wins → we get **5**

So we get **5** for sure, vs **4.5** expected if we don’t approve C2.

→ **Better to approve C2**

Now, what about **C1**?

- If we approve C1, we are only increasing its approval count.
- But C2 will win anyway if we approve C2 (since it gets 2 approvals, C1 gets at most 1).
- So **approving C1 does nothing** — it doesn't help C1 win, and it doesn't hurt us.

But if we approve **both**, and Player 2 approves C2, then:
- C2: 2 approvals (us + P2)
- C1: 1 approval (us)

→ C2 wins anyway.

So approving C1 adds no benefit.

But — could we **strategically withhold approval of C1** to avoid giving it any points? It doesn't matter.

But more importantly: **Does approving C1 risk anything?**

Only if C1 could win. But C2 is approved by P2, and if we approve C2 → C2 has 2, so even if C1 gets 1, C2 still wins.

So **C1 cannot win**, whether we approve it or not.

Therefore, **approving C1 gives us no benefit**, and **costs nothing**, so we **might as well approve it** to maximize our chance of coordination, but it doesn’t change outcome.

Wait — but what if we **don’t** approve C2? Then C2 only has 1 approval (P2), and C1 has 1 (our approval) → tie → 50% chance of C1 (we get 4) or C2 (we get 5) → expected 4.5 < 5

So we should **definitely approve C2**

But can we **benefit** from approving C1?

No — C1 gives us **worse** payoff and won’t win.

So **best strategy: approve C2, and possibly C1, but it doesn't hurt.**

But **should we approve C1?**

- C1: we get 4 if it wins → but it **won’t win** unless C2 is not approved.
- But if we **don’t** approve C2, then C2 has 1, C1 has 1 → tie → 50% chance → expected 4.5 < 5
- So we would **never** not approve C2
- Therefore, **C1 can never win**, so approving it gives **no benefit** and **no harm**

So we can **approve it or not** — doesn't matter.

But the question is: **what should we approve to maximize our expected payoff?**

Since approving C1 does not change the outcome (C2 wins anyway), we can **approve it or not** — but since it’s free and doesn’t hurt, and we are maximizing expected payoff, **we can approve both**.

But let’s check: Is there a scenario where **not approving C1** helps? No.

So **best response**: **approve C2**, and we can **approve or disapprove C1** without changing our expected payoff.

Since we are told **return a valid JSON with all contracts**, and **the goal is to maximize our expected payoff**, and since **approving C1 doesn’t hurt us**, and we’re free to include it, we can include it.

But wait — **can approving C1 cause a problem?**

Suppose Player 2 **also** approves C1? Then:
- C1: 2 approvals (us and P2)
- C2: 1 (P2 only)
→ C1 wins → we get 4 → **bad for us**

But **will Player 2 approve C1?**

Player 2 gets only **4 points** under C1, but **15 points** under C2 → so Player 2 will **never** approve C1.

So even if we approve C1, Player 2 will **not** approve it.

So C1 gets at most **1 approval** (from us), while C2 gets **2** (us + P2) → C2 wins.

So **no risk**.

Therefore, we can safely **approve both**.

But since **approving C1 doesn’t hurt and adds nothing**, but the system allows us to approve, we **may as well approve both** to show support.

But is there any reason **not to**?

No.

But here’s the point: **our payoff is 5 regardless**, whether we approve C1 or not — **as long as we approve C2**.

So we should **approve C2**, and **can approve C1 if we want**.

But to maximize our **expected payoff**, we care about outcome — and outcome is **C2 wins** as long as we approve C2.

So **approve C2 and C1?**

Yes, safe.

But note: the problem says "**the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.**"

So if we approve **both**, and P2 approves **only C2**, then:
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 2 approvals
→ C2 wins → we get 5

If we approve only C2:
- C1: 0
- C2: 2 → C2 wins → 5

Same outcome.

So **approving C1 is harmless** — it does not cause C1 to win, because it has only 1 approval, C2 has 2.

So we can approve it.

But is there a reason **not** to? Only if we thought it might increase the chance of C1 winning — but it doesn’t.

Therefore, to be safe and to express approval of potentially useful contracts, we can approve both.

But let’s see: what is the **optimal strategy**?

We want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

- **Approve C2**, **approve C1** → outcome: C2 wins → payoff: 5
- **Approve C2**, **disapprove C1** → outcome: C2 wins → payoff: 5
- **Disapprove C2**, **approve C1** → outcome: C1 and C2 both have 1 → tie → 50% C1 (we get 4), 50% C2 (we get 5) → **expected 4.5**
- **Disapprove both** → C2 has 1, C1 has 0 → C2 wins → payoff: 5

So best: **approve C2**, and **approve or disapprove C1** — doesn’t matter.

But if we approve C1, we still get 5.

So **we can approve both** without loss.

But since the question is to **maximize expected payoff**, and **both choices give 5**, we can choose either.

But the safest is to **approve only C2**, to avoid any unnecessary risk.

But since **approving C1** does **not** risk C1 winning (because C2 has 2 approvals), it’s **safe**.

Therefore, we **can** approve both.

But since it’s **neutral**, and the problem allows us to choose, we can approve both.

But here’s a twist: the **contract proposed by Player 2 is C2**, and **Player 1 approves C2?** That’s fine.

But we are **Player 1**, and we are deciding whether to approve.

Final decision:

- We must **approve C2** to get 5
- **Approving C1 is harmless**, and we get no loss, so we can approve it

But note: **if we approve C1, we are not helping it win**, and it won’t win anyway.

So **we can approve both**.

But is it possible that **not approving C1** is better? Only if we thought C1 could win — but it can’t.

So **approval of C1 is irrelevant**.

So to be safe and maximal, **approve both**.

But let’s confirm: **does approving C1 affect anything?**

No — because:
- Player 2 will never approve C1 → so C1 gets at most 1 approval
- We approve C2 → C2 gets 2 approvals → max → C2 wins

So C1 cannot win.

Thus, **we can approve C1 without risk**, and it changes nothing.

So we **approve both**.

---

### ✅ Final answer:

We approve **C2** because it gives us 5 points and will win.
We **can** approve **C1** because it doesn’t hurt us and doesn’t change outcome.

So we return:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

response:
Let’s carefully analyze this decision-making game step by step, including the original payoff structure, the proposed contracts, and how they affect incentives. Our goal is to **maximize our own total points** in the game, and we are playing as **Player 1**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without contracts)**

The payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff in each cell):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 10     | 0      |
| **P1: A1** | 6      | 4      |

So:
- If both choose A0 → (10, 10)
- P1: A0, P2: A1 → (0, 20)
- P1: A1, P2: A0 → (6, 2)
- Both A1 → (4, 4)

This is a variant of a coordination game with a slight asymmetry. Let’s evaluate the best response for each player.

#### **Player 1’s Best Strategy (without contracts):**

- If P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A1

So P1’s best response depends on P2’s action.

#### **Player 2’s Best Strategy (without contracts):**

- If P1 plays A0:
  - P2 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So P2 **always prefers A1** no matter what P1 does.

→ This means **P2 has a dominant strategy: A1**

Therefore, **in equilibrium without contracts**, P2 will play A1 with probability 1.

Then P1, anticipating that, will choose:
- A0 → 0 points
- A1 → 4 points

So P1 prefers **A1**, getting 4 points.

So **without contracts**, the expected outcome is:
- P1: A1
- P2: A1
- Payoffs: (4, 4)

But P1 might want to **change this outcome** to something better via contracts.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contracts and how they modify payoffs**

Contracts **add side payments** based on the actions taken. These are **not** part of the original payoff but are extra.

Remember: The **contract is only in effect if it is approved by both players**, and we choose whether to **approve** the contract (and we are only Player 1).

The **winning contract** is chosen **uniformly at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.

So we want to **approve contracts** that are **likely to be selected**, and that **maximize our expected points** — taking into account both the **contract’s effect on the game** and **whether it gets approved**.

But since the contract is implemented only **if it gets approved**, and we are choosing our approvals, we need to think: **Which contracts increase our expected payoff, and are likely to be selected?**

But here’s the twist: **We only control our approvals**. So we must:
- Decide whether to approve each contract.
- If multiple contracts have the same maximum number of approvals, one is chosen uniformly at random → we’ll get to play under **that** contract.

So our **best strategy** is to:
- Approve contracts that **increase our expected payoff**, **if they are likely to be elected**.
- Avoid approving contracts that **hurt us**, or make the game worse.

But we don’t get to choose the contract — only the approvals. So we must **strategically approve** to **induce favorable contracts** to be selected.

Let’s analyze each contract in detail.

---

### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since there are only two players, "distributed equally among other players" means:
- If a player plays A0, they **lose 1 point**, and the **other player gains 1 point**.
- If a player plays A1, no change.

So this is a **cost of 1 point for playing A0**, and the opposing player gets +1.

So this **punishes playing A0**, **encourages playing A1**.

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix under C1**, assuming both players follow the contract.

We are **Player 1**, so our payoffs (and P2’s) are adjusted based on actions.

#### New Payoffs (C1):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 10 - 1 = 9 | 0 + 1 = 1 |
| **P1: A1** | 6 + 1 = 7 | 4 + 0 = 4 |

Wait — let’s be careful:

The rule is: **The player who chooses A0 pays 1 point to the other player**.

So when P1 chooses A0, they pay 1 point **to P2** → P1 loses 1, P2 gains 1.

When P2 chooses A0, P2 loses 1, P1 gains 1.

So in each cell:

- (A0, A0): P1 loses 1 (because P1 chose A0), P2 loses 1 (because P2 chose A0), but they pay to each other.
  → So net: P1: 10 - 1 = 9, P2: 10 - 1 = 9
- (A0, A1): P1 chooses A0 → loses 1 → gets 0 - 1 = -1
  P2 chooses A1 → no payment
  → P1: -1, P2: 20 + 1 = 21 (because P1 paid P2)
- (A1, A0): P1 chooses A1 → no cost
  P2 chooses A0 → pays 1 to P1 → P1 gets 6 + 1 = 7
  P2 gets 2 - 1 = 1
- (A1, A1): no payments → (4,4)

So revised payoff matrix (C1):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 9      | -1     |
| **P1: A1** | 7      | 4      |

Now, analyze best responses under C1.

#### Player 1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 9 (A0) vs 7 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets -1 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

#### Player 2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 9 (A0) vs 21 (A1) → prefers A1
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So **P2 always prefers A1**

Then P1, anticipating P2 plays A1:
- P1 chooses A0: -1
- P1 chooses A1: 4 → so P1 chooses A1

→ Equilibrium: (A1, A1) → payoffs: (4, 4)

Wait — but in original game, same outcome.

But let’s check: is (A0, A0) a possible equilibrium? Only if P1 sticks to A0, P2 sticks to A0.

But P2 **never** wants to play A0 — if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A1 (21 > 9). So P2 always deviates.

So **only equilibrium** is (A1, A1) → (4,4)

So C1 **leads to same outcome** as baseline.

But here’s the **catch**: C1 is **proposed by Player 1** — so likely **P1 supports it**, but **P2 may not**.

Why wouldn’t P2 support it?

Because **under C1**, if P2 plays A0, they **lose 1 point** (to P1). So P2 is **penalized for A0**, which is **bad for them**, since they already prefer A1 anyway.

But they might **dislike** the contract because it makes playing A0 cost more (even though they don’t play it), but the **existence** of the penalty could harm them if they ever deviate.

But since they are rational, they know they wouldn’t play A0 anyway — so maybe they don’t care.

But let’s suppose P2 **does** consider the cost of playing A0.

However, P2 gets **+1 if P1 plays A0**, so if P1 plays A0, P2 gains 1 from the contract, which is good for them.

But in equilibrium, P1 is playing A1, so P2 never gets that.

So P2: under C1, their payoffs are still (4 in (A1,A1)), and otherwise worse — so P2 might be **indifferent** or slightly **opposed** because the contract punishes them (if they played A0), but since they don’t, it doesn’t hurt.

But **C1 penalizes A0 players**, and since P2 **never plays A0**, the penalty **doesn’t affect P2’s payoff**, but it *does* reduce P1’s payoff when they play A0.

So for P2, the **only effect** is that if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 1 more point (from P1’s penalty). But since P1 plays A1, P2 never gets it.

So **P2 gets no benefit** from C1, but **P1 gets no direct benefit either** — the equilibrium is same as before.

But P1 **proposed** C1. So P1 will likely **approve** it.

P2? Might **not approve** it — because their payoff is unchanged, but the contract imposes unnecessary cost (even if not incurred), and it makes P1 worse off when playing A0, which might not be beneficial to P2.

But since P2 gets no gain and doesn’t care, they might be **indifferent**.

In approval voting, **indifferent players might approve if they see no harm**.

But let’s suppose P2 would **not approve** C1, because:
- It doesn’t help them
- It makes them more cautious (fear of penalty for A0), even though they don’t play A0
- It may be seen as P1 trying to reduce P1’s options (e.g., discouraging A0), which could be used to exploit P2

But actually, P2 might **approve** if they see no downside.

But note: **P2 could be hurt** if they ever played A0 — but they don’t.

So **P2 might approve C1** if they think it’s harmless.

But let’s consider **C2**, which is proposed by P2.

---

### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they **receive** an additional payment of 10 points, **drawn equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, they **pay** an additional payment of 10 points, **distributed equally among the other players**.

So:
- Play A0 → gain 10 (from other player)
- Play A1 → pay 10 (to other player)

"Drawn equally from the other players" → since only one other player, they get +10 if they play A0, and pay 10 if they play A1, with the **other player** paying or receiving.

So again, **when a player plays A0, they get +10 from the other player**.
When they play A1, they **pay 10 to the other player**.

So:

#### New Payoffs (C2):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 10 + 10 = 20 | 0 - 10 = -10 |
| **P1: A1** | 6 - 10 = -4 | 4 + 10 = 14 |

Explanation:

- (A0, A0): P1 plays A0 → gets +10 from P2 → 10 + 10 = 20
  P2 plays A0 → gets +10 from P1 → 10 + 10 = 20
- (A0, A1): P1 plays A0 → gets +10 from P2 → 0 + 10 = 10? Wait — **no**

Wait: The rule is: **"If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players."**

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +10 from the **other player**
- If **you** choose A1 → you **pay** 10 to the **other player**

So in (P1: A0, P2: A1):
- P1 plays A0 → gets +10 → original 0 + 10 = **10**
- P2 plays A1 → pays 10 → original 20 - 10 = **10**

So payoff: (10, 10)

Wait! That’s symmetric.

Let’s redo carefully:

In **each cell**, determine the **additional payments**:

#### (A0, A0):
- P1: plays A0 → gets +10 from P2
- P2: plays A0 → gets +10 from P1
- So: P1: 10 + 10 = 20
- P2: 10 + 10 = 20

#### (A0, A1):
- P1: plays A0 → gets +10 from P2
- P2: plays A1 → pays 10 to P1
  → So P2 loses 10
- P1: 0 + 10 = 10
- P2: 20 - 10 = 10

#### (A1, A0):
- P1: plays A1 → pays 10 to P2
- P2: plays A0 → gets +10 from P1
- P1: 6 - 10 = -4
- P2: 2 + 10 = 12

Wait, no: 
- P2 plays A0 → gets +10 **from P1**
- P1 plays A1 → pays 10 **to P2**
→ So P1: 6 - 10 = -4
→ P2: 2 + 10 = 12

But that seems asymmetric.

Wait: the rule says “drawn equally from the other players” — since only one other player, it’s **exactly from the other player**.

So **yes**, if you play A0, you get +10 **from the other player**.
If you play A1, you pay -10 **to the other player**.

So:

#### Final payoffs (C2):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 10 + 10 = 20 (from P2) | 0 + 10 = 10 (from P2) |
| **P1: A1** | 6 - 10 = -4 (to P2) | 4 + 10 = 14 (from P2) |

Wait — when P1 plays A1, P1 **pays 10 to P2**
When P1 plays A0, P1 **gets 10 from P2**

So:

- (A0, A0): P1: 10 + 10 = 20; P2: 10 + 10 = 20
- (A0, A1): P1: 0 + 10 = 10; P2: 20 - 10 = 10
- (A1, A0): P1: 6 - 10 = -4; P2: 2 + 10 = 12
- (A1, A1): P1: 4 - 10 = -6; P2: 4 + 10 = 14

Wait, no! In (A1, A1):
- P1: plays A1 → pays 10 to P2
- P2: plays A1 → pays 10 to P1
→ Net for P1: 4 - 10 + 10 = 4
→ P2: 4 - 10 + 10 = 4

Ah! Yes — both pay each other.

So in (A1, A1): both pay 10 to the other, so net zero change → (4,4)

But that only if **both** play A1.

Let’s be precise:

In each pair:

- If a player plays A0 → they **gain 10 from the other**
- If a player plays A1 → they **lose 10 to the other**

So:

#### Payoffs under C2:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 10 + 10 = 20 | 0 + 10 = 10 |
| **P1: A1** | 6 - 10 = -4 | 4 - 10 + 10 = 4 |

Wait — when P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0:
- P1: A1 → pays 10 to P2 → 6 - 10 = -4
- P2: A0 → gets 10 from P1 → 2 + 10 = 12

So P1: -4, P2: 12

When P1: A1, P2: A1:
- P1: A1 → pays 10 to P2 → 4 - 10 = -6
- P2: A1 → pays 10 to P1 → 4 - 10 = -6
- Wait: no — both pay each other? That would cancel.

But the rule says: "**If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 points, distributed equally among the other players.**"

Since only one other player, it’s 10 to that player.

So **P1 pays 10 to P2**, **P2 pays 10 to P1**

→ Net: no change

So P1: 4, P2: 4

But in terms of **individual transactions**, yes, each pays 10 to the other.

So **net zero effect** → (4,4)

Similarly, in (A0, A1):
- P1: A0 → gets 10 from P2
- P2: A1 → pays 10 to P1
→ So P1: 0 + 10 = 10, P2: 20 - 10 = 10

So full matrix under C2:

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 20     | 10     |
| **P1: A1** | -4     | 4      |

Now, analyze best responses.

#### Player 1’s best response:
- If P2: A0 → P1: 20 (A0) vs -4 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2: A1 → P1: 10 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

→ **P1 always prefers A0**

#### Player 2’s best response:
- If P1: A0 → P2: 20 (A0) vs 10 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P1: A1 → P2: 12 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A0

→ **P2 always prefers A0**

So **both players have dominant strategy: A0**

→ Equilibrium: (A0, A0) → payoffs: (20, 20)

That’s **great for both players** — especially **for us (P1)**, who goes from 4 to **20**.

So **C2 increases P1’s payoff dramatically**.

Now: **Does Player 2 want to approve C2?**

C2 is **proposed by Player 2**.

Under C2, P2 gets **20** in (A0,A0), which is **better** than original 4.

So P2 definitely wants this contract (since they get 20).

So **P2 will approve C2**.

Now **P1**: do we want C2? We get 20 — yes! So **P1 also wants C2**.

So both players **want to approve C2**.

But wait: let’s confirm.

C2 gives P1: 20 in equilibrium — much better than 4.

So both players have **incentive to approve it**.

So **C2 will be approved by both** → approvals = 2.

Now, what about C1?

C1: proposed by P1, penalizes A0.

As we saw earlier, **equilibrium is still (A1,A1)** → (4,4), same as baseline.

So P1 gets **no gain** from C1.

But P1 proposed it — probably wants to improve the situation.

But **P1 gets same payoff** under C1 as without contract.

So **P1 has no incentive to benefit from C1** — since it doesn’t increase our payoff.

But **P2** — under C1:
- P2 plays A1 → gets 4
- Only if P2 played A0, they’d pay 1, but they don’t.
- But **if P1 played A0**, P2 would gain 1 from P1’s penalty → but P1 doesn’t play A0.

So P2 gets **no benefit** and **no cost** — so **P2 might be indifferent**.

But since C1 punishes A0, and P2 doesn’t play it, but **might worry about P1 playing A0**, which could hurt P2 (in original game, if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1, P2 gets 20 — but under C1, P2 gets 21? Wait no.

Wait — under C1, (A0, A1): P1 pays 1 to P2 → so P2 gets 20 + 1 = 21

So **if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1**, P2 gets **21** — better than original 20.

But P1 doesn’t play A0 — so P2 doesn’t get it.

But **P2 might be happy** because it **increases their payoff if P1 plays A0**.

But in equilibrium, P1 is not playing A0 → so no benefit.

But P2 might **approve C1** because:
- No harm
- Slight chance of gain if P1 plays A0
- But P1 is not going to play A0 under C1 either (since best response is A1 when P2 plays A1)

So **P2 gains nothing**.

But C1 **doesn’t hurt P2**.

So P2 might **approve C1**, but not necessarily.

But **P1 already gets no gain**, and might worry: C1 **punishes them if they play A0**, but since they play A1 anyway, no cost.

So P1 is **neutral**.

But **P1 proposed C1**, so they are **likely to approve it**.

But **P2 may not approve it**, since it gives them no benefit.

In fact, P2 might **oppose C1** because it **penalizes A0**, but **P2 doesn't care about A0**, so they might see it as **P1 trying to restrict choices**.

But since P2 is indifferent, we assume they **approve if no cost**.

But to be safe, let’s consider the **probability of election**.

C2: both players approve → approvals = 2 → will be selected.

C1: only P1 likely approves → approvals = 1 (if P2 opposes) or 2 (if P2 approves).

But P2 has **no incentive to approve C1** — it doesn’t benefit them.

So **P2 will not approve C1**.

Therefore, C1 gets only 1 approval (P1).

C2 gets 2 approvals (both).

So **only C2** has maximum approval (2).

Therefore, **C2 will be selected with probability 1**.

Thus, **if we approve C2**, we are guaranteed to play under C2.

But if we disapprove C2, then C2 has only 1 approval (P2’s), so **C2 fails**, and C1 has 1 approval (P1’s), so **both C1 and C2 have 1 approval**, so one is chosen at random.

Then:
- With 50% chance, C1 → P1 gets 4
- With 50% chance, C2 → P1 gets 20
- Expected payoff: 0.5×4 + 0.5×20 = 2 + 10 = 12

But if we **approve C2**, then:
- C2 has 2 approvals → guaranteed to be selected → P1 gets 20
- So we get 20

So **better to approve C2**.

Now, what about **approving C1**?

We are allowed to approve both.

But we must consider: if we approve both C1 and C2:

- C2: 2 approvals → wins
- C1: 1 approval → loses

So **C2 is selected** anyway.

So approving C1 is **free** — it doesn’t hurt us.

But does it harm us?

Only if approving C1 **reduces the chance** of C2 being selected.

But no — C2 has 2 approvals (P1 and P2) regardless.

So **approving C1 doesn’t hurt C2’s chances**.

But **approving C1 might lower the maximum approval count**?

No — C2 has 2 approvals.

C1 has 1.

Maximum is 2 → C2 wins.

So **C1 is irrelevant**.

But what if **P2 doesn’t approve C1**?

We don’t care — we still win with C2.

But **is there any downside** to approving C1?

- P1 pays 1 point if playing A0? But in C2, we never play A0 anyway — we play A0 in equilibrium under C2.

Wait — under C2, we play A0.

But in C2, **A0 gives us +10**.

But in C1, **A0 costs 1**.

But **C1 is not selected** — so we only play under C2.

So **C1 has no effect**.

Therefore, **approving C1 is harmless** — we don’t suffer from it.

But since **we can approve it for free**, and it doesn’t hurt, and **won’t affect outcome**, we might as well approve it.

But wait: **is there a risk?**

Suppose P2 **does** approve C1.

Then C1 also has 2 approvals → both C1 and C2 have 2 approvals → then **one is selected uniformly at random**.

Then:
- 50%: C1 → P1 gets 4
- 50%: C2 → P1 gets 20
→ Expected: 12

But if we **only approve C2**, then C2 gets 2 approvals → **guaranteed** selection → **20**

So **if P2 approves C1**, then **our approval of C1 is bad** — it reduces our expected payoff from 20 to 12.

Therefore, **we should not approve C1** — because if P2 approves C1, then **both contracts have 2 approvals**, so **random selection**, and we risk losing.

But **will P2 approve C1?**

P2 **proposed C2**, and wants **C2** to be selected.

P2 wants **C2** because it gives them 20.

**C1** gives P2: **in equilibrium, 4** — same as before.

So P2 has **no incentive** to approve C1 — it **does not help them**, and **might hurt their chance** of getting C2.

So **P2 will not approve C1**.

Therefore, **C1 can only have 1 approval (from us)**.

C2 has 2 approvals (from us and P2).

So **C2 has strictly more approvals** → wins.

So even if we approve C1, **C2 still wins**.

Therefore, **approving C1 does no harm**, and **does not prevent C2 from winning**.

So **we can approve C1 without risk**.

But why would we?

It’s **free** — no cost, no risk.

So **we might as well approve both**.

But let’s see: in the final outcome, we get 20 either way.

So **approving C1 is safe**.

Therefore, we should **approve both contracts**.

But wait — **what if the game mechanics require us to choose only one?**

No — the instruction says: **return a JSON with all contracts approved or not**.

We can approve multiple.

But is there a reason not to?

Only if it **hurts**.

But as shown:
- C1 has only 1 approval (ours) → not selected
- C2 wins anyway
- No harm

So ** approve both **.

But wait — reconsider: is **P2** likely to approve C1?

We don’t know — but **P2 has no incentive** to approve C1.

In fact, **P2 has incentive to oppose C1**, because:
- C1 might lead to outcomes where P1 plays A1, but P2 is not helped.
- C1 is not beneficial to P2.

So **P2 will not approve C1**.

Therefore, C1 has **only 1 approval**.

C2 has 2.

So C2 wins.

Therefore, we get **20** in either case.

But if we **don’t approve C1**, we still get 20.

So **it doesn’t matter**.

But since **approving C1 is free**, we might as well do it.

But is there any rule against approving multiple?

No.

So final decision:

- **Approve C1**: Yes (no downside, free)
- **Approve C2**: Yes (we benefit)

So:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

But wait — **C1 does not help us** — and we might wonder: **is there a risk?**

Suppose P2 **does** approve C1 — but we think they won’t.

But we should act based on rational expectation.

P2 has **no incentive** to approve C1 — it offers them **no benefit**, and **might reduce their chance** of getting C2.

So **P2 will not approve C1**.

So **C1 will not pass**.

So **no risk**.

Therefore, we can safely approve both.

But here’s a twist: **what if C1 is designed to make us play A1**, but we don’t want that.

But in our case, we **want to play A0 under C2**, so C1 might harm us if we accidentally switch.

But again, **C1 is not selected**.

So we are only playing under C2.

So no issue.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

We approve both contracts because:
- Approving C2 ensures we play under a contract that gives us 20 points (vs 4 originally).
- Approving C1 is harmless, as P2 has no incentive to approve it, so C1 won’t be selected.
- Therefore, both approvals cause no harm and C2 is selected anyway.

Thus, we return:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

We are Player 2 in a two-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|          | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0   | (10, 10) | (2, 6) |
| P1: A1   | (20, 0) | (4, 4) |

We are Player 2, so we care about our own payoff.

Let’s define:
- We choose A0 with probability p
- Opponent (Player 1) chooses A0 with probability q

Then, our expected payoff is:

E = q [p×10 + (1−p)×2] + (1−q) [p×20 + (1−p)×4]

Simplify:
- E = q [10p + 2(1−p)] + (1−q) [20p + 4(1−p)]
- E = q [10p + 2 − 2p] + (1−q) [20p + 4 − 4p]
- E = q [8p + 2] + (1−q) [16p + 4]

So:
E = q(8p + 2) + (1−q)(16p + 4)

We are to find the best response in the base game. But before that, let's analyze the **contract**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- If you play A0, you get +11 on top of what you’d get from the base game.
- This +11 is taken from *the other player* (i.e., the other player loses 11 points when you play A0).
- If you play A1, no extra payment.

Importantly:  
- The contract is **only active if both players sign it**.
- The contract was proposed by **Player 2** (you), and it's currently your decision whether to sign it.

So we must ask: **Should I sign the contract, assuming the other player will also sign it?** (Because if the other player doesn’t sign, the contract doesn’t activate.)

> So the **contract is active only if both sign**.

But the problem says: "The contract becomes active only if all players sign it."

So we must consider: **What if the other player signs? Will it be better for me to sign too?**

We need to assess: **Would signing the contract be beneficial for me, assuming the other player also signs?**

So we analyze the **contracted game**, under the assumption that **both players sign**.

---

### Step 3: Payoff Matrix With Contract (Both Signed)

Now, whenever a player chooses A0, they get +11 **(and the opponent loses 11)**.

So the payoffs **change**.

Let’s recompute the full payoff matrix, now with contract.

Note: The contract applies to both players. So if I play A0, I get +11, and the opponent loses 11. Similarly, if the opponent plays A0, they get +11, and I lose 11.

Let’s compute new payoffs:

#### Case 1: You (P2) play A0, Opponent (P1) plays A0

- Base: (10, 10)
- You play A0 → +11 (from contract) → total: 10 + 11 = 21
- Opponent plays A0 → +11 → total: 10 + 11 = 21, **but you lose 11** because opponent played A0
- So you get 10 (base) + 11 (you played A0) - 11 (opponent played A0) = **10**
- Opponent gets 10 + 11 (their A0) - 11 (your A0) = **10**

Wait: the contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn equally from the other players" → since only one other player, so **11 from that player**.

So: When you play A0, you get +11, and the opponent loses 11.

When opponent plays A0, opponent gets +11, and **you lose 11**.

So both effects apply simultaneously.

Thus:

> Total payoff = Base payoff + (11 if you play A0) - (11 if opponent plays A0)

Wait: actually, "drawn equally from other players" — if both play A0, then both get +11, and each loses 11 to the other.

So net effect: each gets +11 - 11 = 0 from contract.

Let’s formalize:

Let:
- C_you = 11 if you play A0, else 0
- C_opp = 11 if opponent plays A0, else 0

Then:
- Your total payoff = Base payoff + C_you - C_opp
- Opponent's total payoff = Base payoff + C_opp - C_you

This makes sense: each gains 11 when they play A0; that 11 comes from the other player, so the other player loses 11.

So now compute the new payoffs.

---

#### New Payoff Matrix (With Contract, Both Signed):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | (10 + 11 - 11 , 10 + 11 - 11) = (10, 10) | (2 + 11 - 0 , 6 + 0 - 11) = (13, -5) |
| **A1** | (20 + 0 - 11 , 0 + 11 - 0) = (9, 11) | (4 + 0 - 0 , 4 + 0 - 0) = (4, 4) |

Let’s go one by one:

- (A0, A0):  
  - You play A0 → +11, opponent plays A0 → you lose 11 → net from contract: 0  
  - So payoff: 10 + 0 = 10  
  - Opponent: 10 + 0 = 10

- (A0, A1):  
  - You play A1 → no +11  
  - Opponent plays A0 → you lose 11  
  - Base: you get 2 → final: 2 - 11 = -9? Wait! Hold on.

Wait: the description says: “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 11 points, drawn equally from the other players.”

So only the person who plays A0 gains +11, and the other player loses 11.

So in (A0, A1):
- Opponent (P1) plays A0 → gets +11 from contract
- You (P2) play A1 → get nothing from contract
- But since opponent played A0, you lose 11

So your payoff = base + 0 (you didn't play A0) - 11 (opponent played A0) = 2 - 11 = **-9**

Opponent: base 6 + 11 (their A0) - 0 (you didn't play A0) = 17

Wait, but this contradicts the “drawn equally from the other players” — if there’s only one other player, the 11 is fully drawn from that one.

So: When someone plays A0, they get +11, and the other player loses 11.

So yes.

Thus correct payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| **A0** | (10 + 11 - 11, 10 + 11 - 11) = (10, 10) | (2 + 0 - 11, 6 + 11 - 0) = (-9, 17) |
| **A1** | (20 + 11 - 0, 0 + 0 - 11) = (31, -11) | (4 + 0 - 0, 4 + 0 - 0) = (4, 4) |

Wait, let’s recheck carefully.

We must be very careful.

Let me define for each cell:

- Your (Player 2) payoff = Base payoff + (11 if you play A0) - (11 if opponent plays A0)
- Opponent’s payoff = Base payoff + (11 if opponent plays A0) - (11 if you play A0)

This reflects that:
- Each player’s A0 choice gives them +11, taken from the other player.

So:

#### (P1 = A0, P2 = A0)
- You: base = 10; +11 (you played A0); -11 (P1 played A0) → 10 +11 -11 = 10
- Opponent: base = 10; +11 (P1 played A0); -11 (you played A0) → 10 +11 -11 = 10

→ (10, 10)

#### (P1 = A0, P2 = A1)
- You: base = 2; +0 (A1); -11 (P1 played A0) → 2 - 11 = -9
- Opponent: base = 6; +11 (A0); -0 (you didn’t play A0) → 6 + 11 = 17

→ (-9, 17)

#### (P1 = A1, P2 = A0)
- You: base = 20; +11 (A0); -0 (P1 didn't play A0) → 20 + 11 = 31
- Opponent: base = 0; +0; -11 (you played A0) → 0 - 11 = -11

→ (31, -11)

#### (P1 = A1, P2 = A1)
- You: base = 4; +0; -0 → 4
- Opponent: base = 4; +0; -0 → 4

→ (4, 4)

So the new payoff matrix (with contract active, both signed):

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1      |
|---------|----------|---------|
| A0      | (10, 10) | (-9, 17)|
| A1      | (31, -11)| (4, 4)  |

---

### Step 4: Analyze Your Best Response in Contracted Game

Now, as Player 2, what should we do in this contracted game?

We want to **maximize our expected payoff**, assuming the other player also has rational incentives and will play optimally.

But we are deciding whether to sign. So we can only sign **if we believe the other player will also sign and we are better off in that case**.

So: **Assuming both sign the contract, what are the Nash equilibria?** What is the best expected payoff we can get?

Let’s find best responses.

Let’s find best responses for each player.

#### Your (Player 2) Best Response

Let q = P(P1 plays A0)

Your expected payoff:

- If you play A0:  
  = q × 10 + (1−q) × 31 = 10q + 31(1−q) = 31 - 21q

- If you play A1:  
  = q × (-9) + (1−q) × 4 = -9q + 4(1−q) = -9q + 4 - 4q = 4 - 13q

Set them equal:

31 - 21q = 4 - 13q  
31 - 4 = 21q - 13q  
27 = 8q → q = 27/8 = 3.375 → impossible (q ≤ 1)

So no indifference point. Compare at q=0 and q=1.

If q = 1 (P1 plays A0):
- You: A0 → 10; A1 → -9 → choose A0

If q = 0 (P1 plays A1):
- You: A0 → 31; A1 → 4 → choose A0

So no matter what q is, **A0 gives higher payoff**?

Check:

Is 31 - 21q ≥ 4 - 13q?

31 - 21q ≥ 4 - 13q  
31 - 4 ≥ 21q - 13q  
27 ≥ 8q → q ≤ 27/8 = 3.375 → always true

So for all q ∈ [0,1], **playing A0 gives you higher payoff than A1**

So **your best response is always to play A0**, no matter what P1 does.

So in the contracted game, you will play A0 with probability 1.

#### What about P1?

Let p = P(you play A0)

P1’s expected payoff:
- If P1 plays A0: p×10 + (1−p)×(-9) = 10p -9(1−p) = 10p -9 +9p = 19p -9
- If P1 plays A1: p×31 + (1−p)×4 = 31p +4 -4p = 27p +4

Set equal:
19p -9 = 27p +4  
-9 -4 = 27p -19p  
-13 = 8p → p = -13/8 → impossible

Now compare:

At p=0: A0 → -9; A1 → 4 → choose A1

At p=1: A0 → 19 -9 = 10; A1 → 27 +4 = 31 → choose A1

So A1 gives higher payoff than A0 for all p?

Check: Is 27p +4 ≥ 19p -9?

27p +4 ≥ 19p -9 → 8p ≥ -13 → always true

So A1 dominates A0 for P1.

Thus: **P1 will always play A1**, regardless of your action.

But we already saw: **you will always play A0**.

So in Nash equilibrium: you play A0, P1 plays A1 → outcome is (A0, A1) = (31, -11)

So your expected payoff in equilibrium: **31**

---

### Step 5: Compare with Base Game (Without Contract)

Now let’s see what happens in the **base game (no contract)**.

Payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0     | A1     |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A0     | (10,10)| (2,6)  |
| A1     | (20,0) | (4,4)  |

Find Nash equilibrium.

Let’s find your best response.

Let q = P(P1 plays A0)

- Play A0: q×10 + (1−q)×2 = 10q + 2 - 2q = 8q + 2
- Play A1: q×20 + (1−q)×4 = 20q + 4 - 4q = 16q + 4

Set equal:
8q + 2 = 16q + 4 → -2 = 8q → q = -0.25 → impossible

So at q=0: A0 → 2; A1 → 4 → choose A1

At q=1: A0 → 10; A1 → 20 → choose A1

So A1 always better? Check:

Is 16q + 4 ≥ 8q + 2 → 8q ≥ -2 → always true

So **you always prefer A1** in base game.

Now P1’s best response:

Let p = P(you play A0)

- P1 plays A0: p×10 + (1−p)×2 = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2
- P1 plays A1: p×0 + (1−p)×4 = 4 - 4p

Set equal: 8p + 2 = 4 - 4p → 12p = 2 → p = 1/6

So:
- If p < 1/6 → A1 better
- If p > 1/6 → A0 better

You play A1 with probability 1 → p=1 > 1/6 → so P1 plays A0

So Nash equilibrium: you play A1, P1 plays A0 → outcome (A1, A0) → you get 20, P1 gets 0

So **your payoff in base game (NE) is 20**

But in the contract game, we found that you get **31** in equilibrium, **if both sign the contract**.

So: **31 > 20**

Thus, by signing the contract, you **increase your expected payoff from 20 to 31**, assuming the other player also signs.

But is that the only possibility?

Wait: we must consider that the other player might not sign. But the contract only activates if **both** sign.

So we must ask: will the other player sign?

The contract was proposed by you (Player 2), and it's a vote. But we are only deciding whether to sign.

So if you sign, but the other player doesn’t, contract doesn't activate → back to base game.

So to benefit from the contract, **both must sign**.

But: the contract was proposed by you. It says: "the contract was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)".

So now both players are deciding whether to sign.

We must ask: **Will the other player sign?**

Let’s check: If **you sign**, would **P1** want to sign?

We can assess whether signing is in P1’s interest, assuming you sign.

So suppose you are fixed to sign (and you always play A0 in the contracted game, as we saw).

Now, would P1 prefer to sign?

P1’s options:
- Sign: then game becomes contracted game → P1’s payoff in NE = -11 (from above: (A0, A1) → P1 gets -11)
- Not sign: game is base game → P1 gets whatever in base NE, which is 0 (when you play A1, P1 plays A0: P1 gets 0)

So P1 compares:
- Sign → gets -11
- Not sign → gets 0

So P1 **does not want to sign**.

Thus: even if you sign, P1 will not sign, because they prefer the base game (0) over the contracted game (-11).

Therefore, **the contract will not be activated**, because P1 will refuse.

Therefore, **if you sign**, and P1 doesn’t, the contract fails.

So you are back to the base game.

But in the base game, you still get 20.

But if you don't sign, can you still get 20?

Yes: if no contract, and both play optimally, you get 20.

But if you sign, and P1 refuses, contract not active → same as base game → 20.

But if you don’t sign, and P1 still plays as usual, you get 20.

So signing doesn’t hurt you — you still get 20.

But wait: could the other player change strategy?

Possibility: Maybe if you sign, it changes P1’s behavior?

But in the base game, P1's best response to you playing A1 is A0 (as we saw).

But if you sign the contract, you may be inclined to play A0 more.

But in the base game, **you play A1** (because it dominates).

Now, here’s the key: **if you sign the contract, but P1 doesn't, then the contract doesn't apply. So the game is still base game.**

So your actions don’t change — you still want to play A1 to get 20.

P1 still plays A0, gets 0.

So outcome is same: (A1, A0) → payoffs (20, 0)

So signing the contract doesn’t benefit you **and** doesn’t hurt you in this scenario (since P1 won’t sign).

But could signing the contract signal something?

In a game-theoretic sense, signing the contract might lead P1 to think you are more likely to play A0? But since the contract only activates if both sign, and P1 knows they won’t sign (they get -11), they won’t sign.

So no signaling effect helps.

Alternatively, consider: if you **don’t sign**, the game is base game → you get 20.

If you **do sign**, the contract is inactive (P1 won’t sign), so same outcome → you get 20.

So **signing doesn’t change your payoff**.

But is there a risk?

Suppose that by signing, you “lock in” a commitment to behave differently? But no — since contract is inactive, rules are unchanged.

So you are indifferent between signing and not signing, in terms of payoff.

But we are to **maximize expected points**.

Since both options give 20, is it better to sign?

But: could the other player **think** that signing means you will play A0, and adjust?

But in reality, without contract, you play A1 (because better for you in base game).

So even if you sign, if contract is inactive, you still play A1.

So P1 will not be fooled.

Therefore: **signing the contract does not increase your payoff**, and since P1 won’t sign, contract doesn’t activate.

Hence, **you gain nothing from signing**.

But wait: is there a chance that P1 *would* sign if you sign?

Suppose P1 reasons: "if I sign, the game becomes contracted. I get -11 if you play A0 (as in best response). But you might play A0?

But from earlier analysis in the contracted game, your best response is always to play A0 — and you would be better off.

But P1 does not want to play A0 in contracted game — they get -11 if they do.

But if P1 thinks you are going to play A0, then P1 would play A1 — gets 4 if you play A0, and contract applies.

Wait: in contracted game, if you play A0 and P1 plays A1 → payoff (31, -11)

P1 gets -11.

Worse than base game.

So P1 never wants to sign.

Thus, **P1 will never sign**.

Therefore, you must conclude: if you sign, the contract is inactive → you get 20.

If you don't sign, you get 20.

So same payoff.

But now: is there **any risk**?

No. Signing doesn't cost you anything.

But the contract says: when you play A0, you get +11 — but only if contract is active.

Since it’s not active, no effect.

So signing doesn’t hurt you.

But we are to **maximize points**, and both options give 20.

So we are indifferent.

But the question is: should you sign?

Since signing does not hurt and doesn’t help, but **the contract would be advantageous if you could enforce it**, but you can't because the other player won't sign.

Therefore: **no benefit from signing**.

But: in the base game, you get 20.

In the **contracted game**, if both signed, you get 31 — which is better.

But since P1 won’t sign, you can’t get that.

Therefore, **signing leads to no improvement**.

But: is there any scenario where signing *increases* your chances of getting a better outcome?

For example, if you sign, and P1 thinks you might play A0, then P1 might play differently.

But in the base game, P1’s strategy is fixed: respond optimally to your action.

If you play A1, P1 plays A0.

If you were to play A0, P1 would play A0 → you get 10, worse for you.

So P1 has no incentive to change.

So: **your strategy in base game is A1, and it remains A1 even if you sign the contract (since contract inactive)**.

Thus, P1 still sees you playing A1, so plays A0.

Outcome: (A1, A0), payoffs (20,0), regardless.

No change.

Therefore: **no benefit from signing**.

But now: what if you **do not sign**? Then the game is base game → same outcome.

So **same payoff**.

But since you are trying to maximize points, and both choices give same payoff, but signing doesn’t help, should you sign?

We must consider: could signing **trigger** the contract?

Only if both sign.

But P1 will not sign.

So no.

Thus, **you should not sign**, because it serves no purpose.

But wait: what if you think that after you sign, P1 might change strategy?

But if P1 changes strategy, they are not playing optimally.

For example, if you sign and play A1, and P1 thinks you are playing A0, they might play A1 → but then they get (A1, A1) → 4, which is better than 0.

But P1 knows that if they play A1, you are playing A1 → base game: (A1, A1) = (4,4) — P1 gets 4.

But if P1 plays A0, they get 0.

So P1 still prefers A1.

But P1 knows you are playing A1.

So no incentive to change.

Thus: **no change in strategy**.

Therefore: **signing the contract is useless**.

But since the contract is “proposed by Player 2”, and we are the only one deciding whether to sign, we must choose.

Now, could there be a **coordination benefit**?

But no — the other player will not cooperate.

Therefore: **you should not sign**.

But let’s double-check: is there any scenario where you get more than 20 if you sign?

Only if the contract activates.

But for it to activate, P1 must sign.

But P1 gets -11 in that equilibrium (when you play A0), which is worse than 0.

So P1 will not sign.

Thus, contract will not activate.

Hence, signing gives no benefit.

So we should **not sign**.

But wait — what if you **commit to sign**, and P1 thinks you will play A0, so P1 plays A1?

Then: if contract active → you get 31.

But only if contract is active.

But for contract to be active, P1 must sign.

But P1 knows that if they sign, they will get -11.

So they won’t sign.

Thus, even if you commit, P1 won’t sign unless they get benefit.

No benefit.

Therefore, **never activated**.

So final: **signing doesn’t help, and costs nothing, but provides no benefit**.

In game theory, when indifferent, you might prefer not to sign if there's no advantage.

But since signing gives no gain, and doesn’t force cooperation, **best to not sign**.

But here's a twist: suppose you don’t sign, and P1 doesn’t sign → base game → you get 20.

If you sign, and P1 doesn’t, same → you get 20.

So mathematically, indifferent.

But the problem says: **"maximize your total points"**.

Since both options give same expected payoff, either is acceptable.

But we must provide a choice.

However, in the absence of benefit, and knowing that P1 won’t sign, it's irrational to sign.

Because signing could be **perceived as a move toward cooperation**, but since the other player won’t cooperate, it’s wasteful.

Moreover, if you sign, and the contract were to activate, you might be worse off — but in this case, you are not.

But in this case, you are not worse off.

So you are indifferent.

But let’s think: if you do not sign, and the other player also does not sign, game is base game → you get 20.

If you sign, but other player doesn’t, game is base game → you get 20.

So same.

But suppose the other player sees you signed — could they update beliefs?

For example, they might think you are more likely to play A0.

But in base game, A0 is bad for you: if you play A0 and P1 plays A0 → you get 10, worse than 20.

So you won’t play A0.

So if you sign, P1 knows you are still playing A1.

No change.

Thus, **no strategic effect**.

Therefore: **signing is pointless**.

Hence, to maximize points, **do not sign**.

But wait — earlier we calculated that in the contracted game, you get 31, which is better than 20.

But since P1 won’t sign, you can never get that.

So you should not sign.

Final answer: **do not sign**.

But let’s consider one last thing: what if the other player **might** sign if they believe you will sign? But as shown, they get -11 in the only equilibrium, so they won’t.

Thus, no.

---

### ✅ Final Decision

You should **not sign** the contract.

Because:
- It only activates if both sign.
- The other player will not sign, because they get a lower payoff (-11) in the contracted game.
- Therefore, the contract will not be active.
- So signing yields no improvement in payoff (you still get 20).
- It serves no strategic purpose.
- Since you aim to maximize points, and signing gives no benefit, you should not sign.

response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Calculate Modified Payoffs with Contract

Let me first determine the actual payoffs after applying the contract:

**Original + Contract payoffs for me (Player 1):**

1. **(A0, A0)**: Base 10 + 10 (I chose A0) - 10 (other chose A0) = **10 points**
2. **(A0, A1)**: Base 0 + 10 (I chose A0) = **10 points**
3. **(A1, A0)**: Base 6 - 10 (other chose A0) = **-4 points**
4. **(A1, A1)**: Base 4 = **4 points**

## Step 2: Analyze My Options

Let me compare my payoffs for each action given what the other player might do:

- **If other player chooses A0**: I get 10 from A0 vs -4 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- **If other player chooses A1**: I get 10 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → **A0 is better**

## Step 3: Identify Dominant Strategy

A0 gives me **10 points regardless** of what the other player does, while A1 gives me at most 4 points (and potentially -4 points).

**A0 strictly dominates A1** for me in this modified game.

## Step 4: Check for Mixed Strategy Benefits

Even if the other player uses a mixed strategy with probability q for A0 and (1-q) for A1:
- Expected payoff from A0: 10q + 10(1-q) = **10** (constant)
- Expected payoff from A1: -4q + 4(1-q) = 4 - 8q (ranges from -4 to 4)

Since 10 > 4 - 8q for all q ∈ [0,1], there's no benefit to playing A1.

## Conclusion

My optimal strategy is to play A0 with certainty, as it maximizes my expected payoff regardless of the other player's strategy.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the expected payoffs for each player under both scenarios: with and without the contract. This will help us determine if the contract is beneficial given the game's payoff matrix.

### Without the Contract
Let's first summarize the payoffs without the contract:
- If both choose A0: Each gets 10 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other gets 0 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other gets 6 points.
- If both choose A1: Each gets 4 points.

### With the Contract
The terms of the contract modify the payoffs:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 10 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they lose 10 points, distributed equally to the other player.

So, let's adjust the payoffs based on this contract:
- If both choose A0: Each gets 10 (original) + 10 (bonus) = 20 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0: You get 20 (original) - 10 (penalty) = 10 points, the other gets 0 (original) + 10 (bonus) = 10 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1: You get 2 (original) + 10 (bonus) = 12 points, the other gets 6 (original) - 10 (penalty) = -4 points.
- If both choose A1: Each gets 4 (original) - 10 (penalty) = -6 points.

### Comparing the Scenarios
Now let's compare the expected payoffs without and with the contract:

1. **Without Contract:**
    - A0 vs A0: 10 vs 10
    - A1 vs A0: 20 vs 0
    - A0 vs A1: 2 vs 6
    - A1 vs A1: 4 vs 4

2. **With Contract:**
    - A0 vs A0: 20 vs 20
    - A1 vs A0: 10 vs 10
    - A0 vs A1: 12 vs -4
    - A1 vs A1: -6 vs -6

### Analyzing Incentives
- Under the contract, there is a strong incentive for both players to choose A0 since the payoff is highest (20 vs 20).
- Choosing A1 becomes significantly less attractive due to the penalty.
- Without the contract, you might have the incentive to pick A1 occasionally to maximize your individual payoff at the risk of another player's score. 

### Summary
The contract encourages cooperation since both players benefit more from choosing A0, resulting in the highest possible mutual payoff (20 points each). In absence of the contract, there is a temptation to defect (choose A1), which leads to more instability and lower total payoffs over time.

Thus, signing the contract aligns both players' incentives toward a cooperative strategy, maximizing total points for each player.

### Decision
Given the above analysis, signing the contract improves the incentives for cooperation and maximizes the potential payoff for both players. Therefore, I will sign the contract.

response:
Let's analyze the game step by step to determine whether you should sign the contract.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game without the contract**

The original payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**               | (10, 10) | (0, 20)  |
| **A1**               | (6, 2)   | (4, 4)   |

This is a classic coordination and exploitation game. Player 1 has a dominant strategy? Let's check.

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1 gets 10 (A0) vs 6 (A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

So no dominant strategy for Player 1. Same for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → prefers A1
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefers A1

**Player 2 always prefers A1**, regardless of Player 1's choice.

So Player 2 has a dominant strategy: **A1**.

Then, Player 1, knowing this, will respond optimally:
- If Player 2 plays A1 → Player 1 gets 0 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A1

So **Nash equilibrium**: (A1, A1), resulting in (4,4)

But Player 1 would prefer (A0, A0) = 10 points.

So there's a conflict: mutual cooperation is better, but deviation is tempting.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0 → no additional payments
- If a player chooses A1 → they pay an additional 5 points, distributed equally among the other players

Since there are two players, **if a player chooses A1, they pay 5 points, which is split equally → the other player gets +2.5** (and the player themselves loses 5).

So the contract changes the payoffs. Let's compute the **new payoffs** under the contract.

We'll compute the total payoff including the contractual payments.

#### **New payoffs under the contract (after signing)**

Let’s assume **you sign the contract** and **Player 2 also signs** (because contract only activates if both sign). So both are subject to it.

Now, compute all outcomes:

---

**(1) You: A0, Other: A0**
- Original: (10, 10)
- A0 → no cost, no transfer
- Payoffs: **(10, 10)**

**(2) You: A0, Other: A1**
- Original: (0, 20)
- You: A0 → no cost
- Other: A1 → they pay 5 points → you get 2.5 (half of 5)
- So your total = 0 + 2.5 = **2.5**
- Their total = 20 - 5 = **15**

→ New payoff: **(2.5, 15)**

**(3) You: A1, Other: A0**
- Original: (6, 2)
- You: A1 → pay 5 → you lose 5
- Other: A0 → no change
- Your total = 6 - 5 = **1**
- Their total = 2 + 0 (they don’t receive anything) → **2**

→ New payoff: **(1, 2)**

**(4) You: A1, Other: A1**
- Original: (4, 4)
- You: A1 → lose 5
- Other: A1 → lose 5
- You get 4 - 5 = **-1**
- Other gets 4 - 5 = **-1**
- But wait! The contract says: "they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players"

So if both choose A1:
- You pay 5 → go to other players → other player gets 2.5
- Other player pays 5 → you get 2.5

So:
- You: 4 (base) - 5 (payment) + 2.5 (from other) = **1.5**
- Other: 4 - 5 + 2.5 = **1.5**

→ New payoff: **(1.5, 1.5)**

---

#### **Contracted payoff matrix:**

| Your \ Other | A0       | A1       |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**       | (10, 10) | (2.5, 15)|
| **A1**       | (1, 2)   | (1.5, 1.5)|

Note: We are now analyzing the game with the contract in place.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze incentives with the contract**

Now, let's see what the equilibria are under the contract.

Let’s check if **A0 is a dominant strategy** for you.

- If Other plays A0:
  - You get 10 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If Other plays A1:
  - You get 2.5 (A0) vs 1.5 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is dominant for you** under the contract.

Now check for Player 2 (other player):

- If You play A0:
  - Other: 10 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → prefer A1
- If You play A1:
  - Other: 2 (A0) vs 1.5 (A1) → prefer A0

So no dominant strategy for Player 2.

But now, **since you have a dominant strategy (A0), you will always play A0**.

If you play A0, then Player 2's best response: 10 (A0) vs 15 (A1) → prefers A1.

So equilibrium is: **You play A0, Other plays A1** → payoff (2.5, 15)

But wait: **can Player 2 credibly threaten to play A1?** Actually, if you play A0, they get 15 vs 10 → yes, they will.

So in the subgame, if you sign the contract, you will play A0, they will play A1 → you get **2.5**

Wait: that’s terrible! You get only 2.5 instead of 4 in the original Nash.

But wait — is this correct?

Hold on: **If you sign the contract and play A0, you get 2.5 if the other plays A1** — which they will, since it gives them 15.

But what if you play A0 and they play A0? You'd get 10.

But **they have no incentive to play A0 if you play A0**, since 10 < 15.

So no equilibrium where both play A0.

So in this contract, the **only stable outcome** is (A0, A1) → you get 2.5

But is that really the outcome?

Yes — under the contract, **you are committed to playing A0** (since dominant), and **they best respond with A1**.

So you get 2.5.

But in the **original game, without the contract**, Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1) → you get 4.

So **you get 2.5 < 4** → **worse under contract**.

But wait — could there be a mixed strategy equilibrium?

Maybe you can do better with mixed strategies? Let's check.

But first: **is there a possibility of coordination?**

Suppose both sign the contract. Can you coordinate on (A0, A0)? That would give you 10.

But Player 2 has **no incentive** to play A0 if you play A0 — they get 10 for A0, 15 for A1 — so they will always deviate.

So **you cannot coordinate on (A0, A0)** — Player 2 will always play A1 if you play A0.

Thus, the outcome is **certain A1 from Player 2**, and you must respond.

You prefer A0 → so you play A0, they play A1 → you get 2.5.

So **if you sign the contract**, you get **2.5** in equilibrium.

---

### **Step 4: What if you don’t sign the contract?**

Then the contract **does not apply**. The game reverts to original.

We already established: Player 2 has dominant strategy A1.

So Player 2 plays A1.

You: best response to A1 is A1 → get 4.

So you get **4**.

Alternatively, could you play A0? Then you get 0 → worse.

So without contract, you get **4**.

---

### **Step 5: Compare outcomes**

- **If you sign the contract**: you get **2.5**
- **If you don’t sign the contract**: you get **4**

So signing hurts you.

Wait — but the contract only activates **if both sign**.

So if you **don’t sign**, even if Player 2 signs, the contract doesn’t apply.

But we are told that **the contract was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)** — but we are deciding whether **to sign**.

The key point: **the contract only becomes active if all players sign**.

So if you **refuse to sign**, the contract **does not take effect**, regardless of what Player 2 does.

So your payoff if you don’t sign: original game.

As established: Player 2 plays A1 (dominant), you best respond with A1 → you get 4.

If you **sign**, and Player 2 **also signs** (assume they will, since proposed and approved), then the new game applies, and you get 2.5 — worse.

So signing **reduces your payoff**.

But — is there a possibility that signing the contract changes Player 2’s behavior?

Possibly — but Player 2’s payoff in the contract game:

In the **contracted game**, if you play A0, Player 2 gets 15 for A1, 10 for A0 → still prefers A1.

So no change.

Player 2 will still play A1.

So the equilibrium remains (A0, A1) → you get 2.5.

Thus, **signing the contract causes a 1.5 point loss in payoff**.

---

### **Step 6: Could signing help in some way?**

Maybe by making you commit to A0, you can get Player 2 to play A0?

But no — because in the contracted game, Player 2 still gets 15 for A1, which is better than 10 for A0. So no incentive.

The contract makes **playing A1 costly for everyone**, but in this case, the cost is partially offset by receiving payments from others.

In (A1, A1), both pay 5, but each gets 2.5 from the other → net cost: 2.5 each → so 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 → better than without contract? Wait.

Wait: in original (A1, A1) → 4 each

In contracted (A1, A1) → 1.5 each → worse.

But in (A0, A1): you get 2.5 vs original 0 → better for you!

But you’re getting worse overall because you can’t get both to cooperate.

But crucial point: the contract makes **A1 worse** for the player who plays it, and pays the other player.

So if both want to play A1, now they are worse off.

But Player 2 still has incentive to play A1, because in (A0, A1), they get 15.

Only if they thought you might play A0, they still prefer A1 → they can "cheat" and still get more.

---

### **Conclusion**

- Without contract: you play A1, other plays A1 → you get **4**
- With contract: you are forced into playing A0 (dominant), other plays A1 → you get **2.5**

So **signing the contract reduces your payoff** from 4 to 2.5.

Therefore, you should **not sign**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 5 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 1

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

response:
For Player 2, compare your payoffs between **A0** and **A1** against each possible action of Player 1:

- If Player 1 plays **A0**:  
  - You get 10 with **A0**, 20 with **A1** → **A1 is better**.
- If Player 1 plays **A1**:  
  - You get 2 with **A0**, 4 with **A1** → **A1 is better**.

So **A1 strictly dominates A0** (it yields a higher payoff no matter what Player 1 does). Therefore, to maximize expected points, choose **A1 with 100% probability**.

response:
Let's carefully analyze the game step by step, taking into account both the original payoff structure and the **contract** that modifies the payoffs due to the payment rule.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game without the contract

The original payoff matrix (Player 2 is you):

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0       | A1       |
|------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                             | 10, 10   | 2, 6     |
| **A1**                             | 20, 0    | 4, 4     |

Here, the first number is your payoff, the second is the other player's.

---

### Step 2: Incorporate the **contract** rule

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players.

Important implications:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +10 points.
- The **other player** loses 10 points, because the 10 points are "drawn from the other player".
- If **you** choose A1 → no additional payment.
- Same applies if the **other player** chooses A0 or A1.

So this contract **modifies the payoffs**.

Let’s adjust the payoffs.

---

### Step 3: Adjust payoffs to include the contract

Let’s define the **net payoff** for you (Player 2) and the other player (Player 1) after accounting for the contract.

Each time a player chooses A0, they get +10, and the other player gets -10.

So in every outcome:

- If **you** choose A0 → you get +10.
- If **other player** chooses A0 → they get +10 (and you get -10).

So total effect on you:
- +10 if you choose A0
- -10 if other player chooses A0

Same logic applies for the other player.

Thus, we can compute your **net payoff** as:

> Original payoff from matrix + (10 if you play A0) - (10 if other player plays A0)

Similarly, the other player's payoff is:

> Original payoff from matrix + (10 if they play A0) - (10 if you play A0)

So let's compute updated payoffs for **you** (Player 2):

---

#### Case 1: You A0, Other A0
- Original: 10, 10
- You get +10 (because you played A0)
- You get -10 (because other played A0)
- So your total: 10 + 10 - 10 = **10**
- Other player: 10 + 10 - 10 = 10

→ (10, 10)

#### Case 2: You A1, Other A0
- Original: 20, 0
- You played A1 → no +10
- Other played A0 → you get -10
- Your total: 20 - 10 = **10**
- Other player: 0 + 10 - 10 = 0

→ (10, 0)

#### Case 3: You A0, Other A1
- Original: 2, 6
- You played A0 → +10
- Other played A1 → no effect on you
- Your total: 2 + 10 = **12**
- Other player: 6 - 10 = -4 (because you played A0)

→ (12, -4)

#### Case 4: You A1, Other A1
- Original: 4, 4
- You played A1 → no +10
- Other played A1 → no +10
- No adjustments
- Your total: 4
- Other player: 4

→ (4, 4)

---

### Updated Payoff Matrix (You are Player 2):

| Your Action \ Other Player | A0     | A1     |
|----------------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0**                     | 10, 10 | 12, -4 |
| **A1**                     | 10, 0  | 4, 4   |

Now we can analyze your best strategy.

---

### Step 4: Find your optimal mixed strategy

Let’s suppose:
- You choose A0 with probability **p**
- You choose A1 with probability **1 - p**

Let:
- The other player chooses A0 with probability **q**
- The other player chooses A1 with probability **1 - q**

Your expected payoff (as Player 2) is:

> E = p*q*10 + p*(1-q)*12 + (1-p)*q*10 + (1-p)*(1-q)*4

Let’s compute this:

Break it down:
- p*q*10
- p*(1-q)*12 = 12p - 12pq
- (1-p)*q*10 = 10q - 10pq
- (1-p)*(1-q)*4 = 4(1 - p - q + pq) = 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq

Now sum:

E = 10pq + (12p - 12pq) + (10q - 10pq) + (4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq)

Group terms:

- Constants: 4
- p terms: 12p - 4p = 8p
- q terms: 10q - 4q = 6q
- pq terms: 10pq - 12pq - 10pq + 4pq = (10 -12 -10 +4)pq = -8pq

So:

> E = 4 + 8p + 6q - 8pq

Now, recall: you are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**, and you get to choose p, while q is chosen by the other player.

However, since the other player also wants to maximize their own payoff, we assume they will play optimally — so we look for **Nash equilibrium**.

But we are to choose a probability distribution (your strategy) that maximizes *your* expected payoff, assuming the other player is also rational.

So we need to consider the other player's incentives.

Let’s switch perspective: look at the **other player’s payoff** and find their best response, then deduce your optimal p.

---

### Step 5: Analyze the other player’s (Player 1) payoff

From earlier, their payoff is:

> Original payoff + (10 if they play A0) - (10 if you play A0)

So build their payoff matrix (Player 1):

| Their Action \ Your Action | A0     | A1     |
|----------------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0**                     | 10, 10 | -4, 12 |
| **A1**                     | 0, 10  | 4, 4   |

Let’s verify:

- You A0, Other A0: (10,10) → other gets 10 +10 (they played A0) -10 (you played A0) = 10 → ✅
- You A0, Other A1: (2,6) → other gets 6 -10 (you played A0) = -4 → ✅
- You A1, Other A0: (20,0) → other gets 0 +10 (they played A0) -10 (you played A0) = 0 → ✅
- You A1, Other A1: (4,4) → other gets 4 +0 -0 = 4 → ✅

So Player 1’s payoff matrix (for their own benefit):

| P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|-------|-------|
| 10    | -4    |
| 0     | 4     |

Now let’s compute Player 1’s expected payoff as a function of q (their own action prob) and p (your play A0 prob).

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability p, so A1 with 1-p.

Player 1's expected payoff:

- If P1 plays A0: payoff = p * 10 + (1-p) * 0 = 10p
- If P1 plays A1: payoff = p * (-4) + (1-p) * 4 = -4p + 4 - 4p = 4 - 8p

Player 1 will choose A0 if:
> 10p > 4 - 8p  
> 10p + 8p > 4  
> 18p > 4  
> p > 4/18 = 2/9 ≈ 0.222

So:
- If p > 2/9 → Player 1 plays A0
- If p < 2/9 → Player 1 plays A1
- If p = 2/9 → indifferent

Since Player 1 is rational, they’ll play optimally in response to your p.

Now, your expected payoff is:
> E = 4 + 8p + 6q - 8pq

But q is not free — it depends on p.

From above:
- If p > 2/9 → q = 1 (Player 1 plays A0)
- If p < 2/9 → q = 0 (Player 1 plays A1)
- If p = 2/9 → q can be anything between 0 and 1 (indifferent), so we can assume they pick the one most favorable to them — but since it's a tie, we assume they pick best response.

But you want to maximize your expected payoff.

Let’s evaluate your expected payoff in both cases.

---

#### Case 1: p > 2/9 → q = 1
Then:
> E = 4 + 8p + 6(1) - 8p(1) = 4 + 8p + 6 - 8p = 10

So E = 10 **regardless of p** (as long as p > 2/9)

So if you play A0 with probability > 2/9, and other player responds with A0, your expected payoff is exactly **10**.

#### Case 2: p < 2/9 → q = 0
Then:
> E = 4 + 8p + 6(0) - 8p(0) = 4 + 8p

Since p < 2/9 ≈ 0.222, this is less than 4 + 8*(2/9) = 4 + 16/9 ≈ 4 + 1.777 = 5.777

So E < 5.777 in this case.

Which is **worse** than 10.

#### Case 3: p = 2/9 → q can be 0 or 1 or mixed

Best for you would be to choose q to maximize E given p = 2/9.

So plug p = 2/9 into E:

> E = 4 + 8*(2/9) + 6q - 8*(2/9)*q  
> E = 4 + 16/9 + 6q - (16/9)q  
> E = (36/9 + 16/9) + (6 - 16/9)q  
> E = 52/9 + (54/9 - 16/9)q  
> E = 5.777... + (38/9)q ≈ 5.777 + 4.222q

So E increases with q.

Thus, **maximum E when q = 1** → E ≈ 5.777 + 4.222 = 10

So again, E = 10

Therefore, **in all cases where p ≥ 2/9**, your expected payoff is **at least 10**, and reaches **10** when p ≥ 2/9.

When p < 2/9, E < 10.

So your **best outcome** is 10, achievable when p ≥ 2/9.

Can you get **more than 10**?

Suppose p ≥ 2/9 → q = 1 → E = 10. So no, you cannot exceed 10 in any equilibrium case.

But is it possible to get more than 10 if the other player plays A1 when you play A0?

Only if p < 2/9 → q = 0 → then E = 4 + 8p < 4 + 8*(2/9) < 5.78 < 10

So never better.

Thus, regardless of what you do, **your maximum achievable expected payoff is 10**, and this is achievable as long as p ≥ 2/9.

But can you guarantee more?

No — it caps at 10.

Now, you want to **maximize your payoff**, and you can only get 10 or less.

So you should aim to be in the region where p ≥ 2/9 so that your expected payoff is 10.

But is **A0** better than A1 in this context?

Let’s check **pure strategies**:

- If you play **A0 with p = 1**:
  - Then other player, seeing p = 1 > 2/9, will play A0 → you get 10

- If you play **A0 with p = 0**:
  - Other player sees p = 0 < 2/9 → plays A1
  - You get: A1 vs A1 → payoff = 4

- If you play **A0 with p = 0.5 > 2/9** → other plays A0 → you get 10

So only when p ≥ 2/9 do you get 10.

But **you have no incentive to deviate below 2/9**.

So to ensure you get at least 10, you must play **A0 with at least 2/9 ≈ 22.2% probability**.

But since you’re maximizing your payoff, and **10 is the maximum possible**, you can achieve **10** by choosing p ≥ 2/9.

Now, can you **guarantee** 10?

Yes, if you play p = 1, you get 10.

But is there a **strictly better** strategy? No, since 10 is the maximum possible.

But wait: can you do **better than 10** in some cases?

Only if you had flexibility to get higher than 10, but from the analysis, it's capped at 10.

But **let’s double-check a mixed strategy**.

Suppose you play p = 0.5.

Then other player plays q = 1.

Your payoff = 10 → as computed.

Suppose you play p = 0.3 (> 2/9 ≈ 0.222), q = 1 → E = 10

Now, suppose the other player is **not rational**? No — we assume rational play.

So best you can get is 10.

But **can you get more than 10 if you mix**?

Suppose you play **p = 0.2 < 2/9**, so other player will play A1.

Then you get:
- E = 4 + 8p = 4 + 1.6 = 5.6 → worse.

So no.

Wait — what if you play a **very small** p? Worse.

So **optimal is to play p ≥ 2/9**, which gives E = 10.

But is there a way to get **higher than 10**?

Let’s test whether **any outcome gives more than 10** for you.

From the updated payoff matrix:

- A0 vs A0: 10
- A0 vs A1: 12
- A1 vs A0: 10
- A1 vs A1: 4

Oh! Wait a minute.

You **get 12** when you play A0 and other plays A1.

But if you play A0, and other plays A1 → you get 12.

But **if you play A0**, then other player has an **incentive to play A1** only if p < 2/9.

But if p is low, you get 12 only if other plays A1.

But if you play A0 with **low p**, then the other player plays A1, and if they do, then **if you play A0**, you get 12.

But you don’t know what you will play — you choose a distribution.

Wait — this suggests a **trick**: maybe you can **mix** in a way that induces the other player to play A1, so that when you play A0, you get 12.

But you are choosing p (your A0 probability), which affects their strategy.

Let’s explore this.

Suppose you set **p < 2/9**, so other player plays **A1**.

Then your expected payoff is:  
> E = 4 + 8p + 6q - 8pq  
But q = 0 → so E = 4 + 8p

Maximum when p approaches 2/9 from below → E → 4 + 16/9 ≈ 5.78

But this is **less than 10**.

So even though the **cell A0,A1 gives you 12**, it only happens with **low probability** if you make p small, and that’s when you **don’t want to play A0** — you're more likely to play A1.

Let’s compute what happens if p < 2/9 → q = 0 (other plays A1)

Then your expected payoff:

- You play A0 with p → payoff 12
- You play A1 with 1-p → payoff 4

So E = p * 12 + (1-p) * 4 = 12p + 4 - 4p = 8p + 4

Same as before.

So maximum is ≈ 5.78

But if p ≥ 2/9 → q = 1 → you play A0 with p → payoff 10  
A1 with 1-p → payoff 10

So E = 10p + 10(1-p) = 10

So **always 10**

So in this case, regardless of p, as long as p ≥ 2/9, you get **10**.

But if you play A0, you get 10; if you play A1, you get 10. So you're indifferent between actions when the other plays A0.

So you can **mix arbitrarily** in that region.

But **can you get more than 10?**

Only in the A0,A1 case: 12.

But to get that, you need:
- The other player to play A1
- You to play A0

But to get the other player to play A1, you must have **p < 2/9**

Then, you play A0 with probability p, but if p is small, you’re playing A0 rarely.

Thus, expected payoff is 8p + 4 < 10

So even though 12 is high, it's unlikely, and overall expected payoff is lower.

Thus, **your best expected payoff is 10**, and you can achieve it by playing **p ≥ 2/9**.

Now, is there a **dominant strategy?** No, because:

- If other plays A0 → you prefer A0 (10) over A1 (10) → indifferent
- If other plays A1 → you prefer A0 (12) over A1 (4) → so you prefer A0

So if you believe other might play A1, you should play A0.

But other will not play A1 unless you play A0 with **very low** probability.

So the **best strategy is to play A0 with at least 2/9 probability** to force the other player to play A0, and then you get **10 for sure**.

If you play less than 2/9, you get less than 10.

Thus, **your optimal strategy is to set p ≥ 2/9**

But which value of p?

You can choose any p ≥ 2/9 — all give you 10.

But perhaps there is a **more stable equilibrium**.

Let’s look for **Nash equilibrium**.

Suppose:
- You play A0 with p ≥ 2/9 → other plays A0
- So other plays A0 → then your best response: what do you prefer?

- If other plays A0:
  - Play A0 → you get 10
  - Play A1 → you get 10
  → **indifferent**

So any p is a best response.

Now, if other plays A0, and you're indifferent, then any p is fine.

But for other player:
- They play A0 only if you play A0 with p ≥ 2/9

So **any p ≥ 2/9** gives a Nash equilibrium, as long as the other player plays A0.

But to make it **tight**, we can choose the minimal p = 2/9 to just meet the threshold.

But since any p ≥ 2/9 gives same expected payoff, and you want to **maximize** your expected payoff (which is 10), any such p is sufficient.

But now — is **p = 1** better?

No, same payoff.

But perhaps **p = 1** is safest: then other player must play A0, and you get 10.

Alternatively, playing p = 100% seems safe.

But is there any downside?

- If you play A0 always, you get 10 → fine

But what if the other player thinks you're playing a mixed strategy?

But in Nash equilibrium, strategies are consistent.

Now, **could the other player deviate if you play p = 1**?

If you play p = 1 → they see you play A0 for sure → so they play A0 → their payoff is 10 (from A0,A0)

If they deviate to A1: they get 0 (from A1,A0) → worse

So they won’t deviate.

Similarly, if you play p = 60%, other plays A0 → you get 10

If you deviate to p = 0, other will play A1 → you get only 4 → worse

So any p < 2/9 is dominated.

Thus, any p ≥ 2/9 is optimal.

But to **maximize** your payoff, you need at least 2/9.

Now, the **question is**: which **percentage** to pick?

You must return **integers** summing to 100.

2/9 ≈ 0.2222 → 22.22%

So minimum integer: **23%**

But wait — if you play **22%**, is that > 2/9?

2/9 ≈ 0.2222 → 22% = 0.22 < 0.2222 → so p = 22% < 2/9 → so other player plays A1 → your expected payoff = 8*(0.22) + 4 = 1.76 + 4 = 5.76

Which is worse than 10.

So **22% is not sufficient**

23% = 0.23 > 0.2222 → so other player plays A0 → you get 10 → good.

So minimum safe integer: **23%**

But you could play **higher**, like 100%, but 23% is sufficient.

But **should you play more?**

Suppose you play p = 100%

Then:
- Other player plays A0
- You get 10
- But if you play A0 always, you get 10

Similarly, if you play p = 23%, same: you get 10

So no difference.

But **is there any reason to prefer higher p?**

No, because your payoff is the same.

But **the contract** is about **A0** giving you +10, but it also costs the other player -10.

But in equilibrium, you're indifferent between actions.

So you could pick the minimal p that ensures q = 1.

But the **only** constraint is that p ≥ 2/9 ≈ 22.22%

So **minimum integer p = 23%**

But wait: what if you play 23%, other plays A0, your payoff is 10.

Similarly, if you play 100%, same.

But is **23%** the best?

It gives the same expected payoff as higher.

But the question is: **you want to maximize your total points**.

You can achieve **exactly 10**, and that’s the maximum possible.

So **any p ≥ 23%** is acceptable.

Now, but what about **risk**?

No, it’s deterministic in expected value.

But **is 23% optimal**?

Actually, **you could do better** — wait.

Wait: **what if you play A0 with p = 0%?** Then you get 4

p = 1%: E = 4 + 0.08 = 4.08

...

p = 22%: 4 + 8*0.22 = 4 + 1.76 = 5.76

p = 23%: now p ≥ 2/9 → q = 1 → you get 10

So yes, discontinuity.

So you can jump from 5.76 to 10.

So **you must play at least 23% to get 10**.

Thus, **minimum to get maximum payoff is 23%**

But **could you play less than 23% if you mix differently?**

No, 22% is not enough.

So **23% is the minimum to achieve the maximum expected payoff of 10.**

Now, the question is: what should you choose?

Since all p ≥ 23% give the same expected payoff, **you can choose any**.

But perhaps the **safest** is to play **100% A0**, to **guarantee** the other player plays A0.

But is 100% better than 23%? No — same expected payoff.

But in case of **non-equilibrium** behavior? But we assume rational play.

But to **guarantee** you get 10, you might prefer p = 100%.

But the problem is: you are playing a **decision-making game**, and you want to **maximize expected payoff**.

And **23%** gives you an expected payoff of 10, same as 100%.

So both are equally good.

But is 23% **allowed**?

Yes, as long as p ≥ 2/9.

But 23% is 0.23 > 0.2222 → yes.

Now, **but can you do better than 10?** No.

So **optimal** is to play **at least 23% A0**.

Now, to choose one answer.

But **what if you play 100% A0**?

- You get 10 → good

- Other player plays A0 → they get 10

- If they deviate to A1 → they get 0 → worse → no incentive

So stable.

Alternatively, you could play a small p.

But **why risk?**

But the decision is only about your own action.

But you are **not required** to play 100%.

But to **maximize** payoff, **10 is the max**, and you can get 10 by playing **23%** or **100%**.

Now, the problem is: **which one to pick**?

But note: if you play **23%**, and other player **mistakenly** plays A1, then your expected payoff drops.

But in game theory, we assume rational opponents.

So if you play p ≥ 2/9, they **must** play A0.

So no risk.

Thus, **23% is fine**.

But is there **any reason to prefer higher**?

Suppose you play p = 23%, and other player is risk-neutral → they play A0.

You get 10.

But if you play p = 100%, you also get 10.

No difference.

But **the contract** gives you a **bonus for A0**, so maybe you should favor A0.

But in equilibrium, you are indifferent.

So no.

But the **minimal** is 23%.

But let’s confirm: 2/9 = 0.2222 → so 22.22%, so 23% is the smallest integer ≥ 22.22%.

So **23%**.

Then A1 = 77%.

But is 77% safe?

Yes.

Alternatively, **100% A0** is also safe.

But **100% A0** is **simpler** and avoids the threshold.

And it gives the same expected payoff.

Moreover, it makes it **guaranteed** that you get the +10 from A0, and the other player will not deviate.

So perhaps **better**.

But is it better? Expected payoff is same.

But **variance?** No, it's deterministic.

So both equal.

But in game theory, multiple equilibria exist.

But the problem doesn’t specify to minimize risk or something — just **maximize total points**.

So **any p ≥ 23%** is optimal.

Now, **to pick one**, perhaps the **most natural** is to play A0 with **100%**, to **safely trigger** the contract and force the other player's response.

But wait: if you play A0 with 100%, other player sees it → plays A0 → you get 10.

If you play 23%, same.

But **23% is not symmetric** — it's very low.

Is there a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**?

Yes: one type is where you play A0 with p ≥ 2/9, other plays A0.

But also, another equilibrium might exist.

Wait: suppose you play p = 0 → other plays A1 → you get 4 → not good.

Or p = 2/9: other is indifferent.

Suppose that at p = 2/9, the other player can play a mixed strategy.

But to maximize their payoff, they are indifferent at q = ?.

But your best response at p = 2/9 is to pick q to maximize E = 5.777 + 4.222q → so they should play q = 1.

So not optimal to play mixed.

Thus, **the only equilibria are when other player plays A0 and p ≥ 2/9**.

So in all, **you should play A0 with at least 23%**.

But which integer?

**23%** is the minimum.

But **100% is also valid and safe**.

But perhaps **100% is better** because it’s simpler and avoids boundary issues.

But let’s think: if you play **100% A0**, then:

- You get 10
- Other player plays A0 (because if p=1 > 2/9)
- You are at the equilibrium

And you get your maximum payoff.

Moreover, you **benefit from the contract** fully.

So **why not**?

But is there **any downside**?

- You play A0: +10 points → good
- Other player: -10 → but you don't care

So no downside.

Thus, **playing A0 with 100% probability** is a **valid and optimal strategy**.

And it’s **simplest**.

And it guarantees you get 10.

**23% is also valid**, but why risk? It’s not necessary.

And the problem asks for a **single** probability distribution.

So we can choose any.

But to **maximize safety**, **100% A0** is better.

Moreover, in the cell A0,A0, you get 10, which is the same as other cells when other plays A0.

But there’s no reason not to.

Thus, I conclude that **playing A0 with 100% probability** is **optimal** and **robust**.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P1
response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without the contract)

We are Player 1. The payoff matrix (from Player 1's perspective) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0        | A1        |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**              | 10        | 0         |
| **A1**              | 6         | 4         |

This is a simultaneous-move game with two players and two actions.

We are to choose a mixed strategy (a probability distribution over A0 and A1) to maximize our **expected payoff**, assuming the other player also chooses a mixed strategy (but we don’t know theirs).

However, since both players choose simultaneously and we’re aiming to maximize our **own expected points**, we need to find a **best response** to the other player’s strategy.

But here's the catch: **We don’t know the other player’s strategy**, and **there’s no indication they are rational, or that we know their motives**.

But since this is a decision-making game and we want to maximize our expected payoff in the long run, **a standard approach is to look for a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies**, especially if no pure strategy is obviously dominant.

---

### Step 2: Look for Nash Equilibrium (Mixed Strategy)

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that Player 1 chooses A0 (so $ 1-p $ = probability of A1)
- $ q $ = probability that Player 2 chooses A0 (so $ 1-q $ = probability of A1)

Our expected payoff as Player 1:

$$
EU_1 = p \cdot q \cdot 10 + p \cdot (1-q) \cdot 0 + (1-p) \cdot q \cdot 6 + (1-p) \cdot (1-q) \cdot 4
$$

Simplify:
$$
EU_1 = 10pq + 0 + 6q(1-p) + 4(1-p)(1-q)
$$

$$
= 10pq + 6q - 6pq + 4(1 - p - q + pq)
$$

$$
= (10pq - 6pq + 4pq) + 6q - 4p - 4q + 4
$$

$$
= 8pq + 2q - 4p + 4
$$

Now, to find a Nash equilibrium, we want to find $ p $ such that **Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1** if Player 2 plays a certain $ q $, and vice versa.

Let’s find the value of $ q $ (Player 2's strategy) such that Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

#### Indifference condition for Player 1:
Set expected payoff from A0 equal to expected payoff from A1.

- If Player 1 plays **A0**, expected payoff = $ q \cdot 10 + (1-q) \cdot 0 = 10q $
- If Player 1 plays **A1**, expected payoff = $ q \cdot 6 + (1-q) \cdot 4 = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

Set them equal:
$$
10q = 2q + 4 \Rightarrow 8q = 4 \Rightarrow q = 0.5
$$

So if Player 2 plays A0 with 50% probability, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now do the reverse: find $ p $ such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

#### Player 2’s payoff matrix:

| P1\P2 | A0   | A1   |
|-------|------|------|
| A0    | 10   | 20   |
| A1    | 2    | 4    |

Wait — note: **Player 2’s payoffs** are:

- (A0, A0): 10
- (A0, A1): 20
- (A1, A0): 2
- (A1, A1): 4

So if Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ p $, A1 with $ 1-p $, then:

- Expected payoff for Player 2 from playing A0: $ p \cdot 10 + (1-p) \cdot 2 = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $
- Expected payoff for Player 2 from playing A1: $ p \cdot 20 + (1-p) \cdot 4 = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4 $

Set them equal:
$$
8p + 2 = 16p + 4 \Rightarrow -8p = 2 \Rightarrow p = -0.25
$$

Wait — **negative probability?** That’s impossible.

This means **there is no mixed strategy for Player 1 that makes Player 2 indifferent**.

But let’s interpret: Player 2’s best response depends on $ p $.

Let’s analyze: When is Player 2 better off playing A0 vs A1?

Compare:
- A0: $ 8p + 2 $
- A1: $ 16p + 4 $

Set $ 8p + 2 > 16p + 4 \Rightarrow -8p > 2 \Rightarrow p < -0.25 $ → never true

So $ 8p + 2 < 16p + 4 $ for all $ p \in [0,1] $

That means **Player 2 always prefers A1**, no matter what Player 1 does.

Wait — let's test:

- If p = 0 (Player 1 always plays A1):
  - A0 for P2: 2
  - A1 for P2: 4 → A1 better
- If p = 1 (Player 1 always A0):
  - A0: 10
  - A1: 20 → A1 better
- If p = 0.5:
  - A0: 8*(0.5)+2 = 4+2 = 6
  - A1: 16*(0.5)+4 = 8+4 = 12 → A1 better

So yes: **Player 2 strictly prefers A1 for all p**.

So Player 2’s unique best response is to play **A1 with probability 1**.

This changes everything.

---

### Step 3: Player 2 will always play A1

Since Player 2 has a **strictly dominant strategy** to play A1 (because it always gives higher payoff than A0, regardless of what Player 1 does), we can conclude that in equilibrium, Player 2 will play A1 with 100% probability.

Now, given that, what should **we** (Player 1) do?

We compute expected payoff for Player 1:

- If we play A0: payoff = $ 1 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 10 $? Wait:

Wait, if Player 2 always plays A1:

- If Player 1 plays A0: result is (A0, A1) → Player 1 gets **0**
- If Player 1 plays A1: result is (A1, A1) → Player 1 gets **4**

So:
- A0: 0
- A1: 4

So clearly, **A1 is better**.

Therefore, **Player 1 should play A1 with 100% probability**.

Is this a Nash equilibrium?
- Player 2: playing A1 — best response to Player 1 playing A1 → yes (since from P2’s perspective: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 2; so A1 better)
- Player 1: playing A1 — best response to P2 playing A1 → yes (4 > 0)

So (A1, A1) is a **Nash equilibrium**, and it’s the only pure one.

Moreover, earlier we saw Player 2 has no incentive to deviate — so even if we mixed, Player 2 still prefers A1.

Thus, **Player 1 should play A1 with 100% probability**.

---

### Step 4: But wait — what about the proposed contract?

> “On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract... Player(s) who rejected it: Player 1”

But the instruction says:

> “You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.”

So **the contract is ignored**. Even though we (Player 1) rejected it, it is not in effect.

So we use the original payoffs.

Even if the contract were active, it would add a penalty: **if you play A1, you pay 5 points, split among others**.

But since **the contract is not active**, we ignore this.

So the payoff matrix stands as is.

---

### Final Decision:

Player 2 will play A1 (dominant strategy), so Player 1 should respond by playing A1 (gets 4 vs 0).

Therefore, Player 1 should play A1 with 100% probability.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game Structure (Without the Contract)

We are playing a simultaneous two-player game with actions:
- A0
- A1

Each player chooses a probability distribution over these two actions. Then, the actions are randomly drawn based on those probabilities, and payoffs are determined based on the outcome.

The **payoff matrix** (from the perspective of Player 1) is:

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

So Player 1's payoffs:
- A0 vs A0 → 10
- A0 vs A1 → 0
- A1 vs A0 → 6
- A1 vs A1 → 4

Player 2’s payoffs (for reference):
- A0 vs A0 → 10
- A0 vs A1 → 20
- A1 vs A0 → 2
- A1 vs A1 → 4

---

### Step 2: Consider the Contract (But It’s Not Active!)

A contract was proposed by Player 2:
- If you choose A0 → get +5 points (paid by the other player).
- If you choose A1 → no extra payment.

But **Player 1 rejected it** → so it is **not in effect**.

Therefore, **we play the original game without any side payments**.

So we ignore the +5 for A0 and the redistribution. The contract has no impact on this round.

---

### Step 3: Determine Rational Play – Best Response & Nash Equilibrium

We need to find a strategy (a probability distribution over A0 and A1) that maximizes our expected payoff, **given that the other player is also rational and will likely play optimally**.

So we consider **mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that **you** (Player 1) choose A0.
- $ q $ = probability that **Player 2** chooses A0.

We want to find the best response for Player 1, assuming Player 2 is also rational and will play a best response to our strategy.

But since both players are symmetric in the sense of rationality, we can compute the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium.

---

#### Step 3.1: Compute Expected Payoff for Player 1

Player 1’s expected payoff when choosing A0:
- With probability $ q $, Player 2 chooses A0 → payoff = 10
- With probability $ 1 - q $, Player 2 chooses A1 → payoff = 0
→ So expected payoff for A0: $ 10q + 0(1 - q) = 10q $

Player 1’s expected payoff for choosing A1:
- With probability $ q $, Player 2 chooses A0 → payoff = 6
- With probability $ 1 - q $, Player 2 chooses A1 → payoff = 4
→ So expected payoff for A1: $ 6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

Now, for Player 1 to be indifferent between A0 and A1 (as in equilibrium), set:

$$
10q = 2q + 4
$$
$$
8q = 4 \Rightarrow q = 0.5
$$

So if Player 2 chooses A0 with probability 0.5, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Thus, in the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, Player 2 will play A0 with probability 0.5.

Now, let’s find what Player 1 should do.

We now assume Player 1 is choosing a mixed strategy $ p $, and find the value of $ p $ such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Compute Player 2’s expected payoffs.

Player 2’s payoff when choosing A0:
- With probability $ p $, Player 1 chooses A0 → payoff = 10
- With probability $ 1 - p $, Player 1 chooses A1 → payoff = 2
→ Expected: $ 10p + 2(1 - p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $

Player 2’s payoff when choosing A1:
- With probability $ p $, Player 1 chooses A0 → payoff = 20
- With probability $ 1 - p $, Player 1 chooses A1 → payoff = 4
→ Expected: $ 20p + 4(1 - p) = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4 $

Set these equal for indifference:

$$
8p + 2 = 16p + 4
$$
$$
2 - 4 = 16p - 8p \Rightarrow -2 = 8p \Rightarrow p = -0.25
$$

Wait – this is **not possible**. $ p = -0.25 $ is invalid (probability can’t be negative).

This means Player 2 **never** finds it optimal to mix — the expected payoff for A1 is always higher than A0 for any $ p \geq 0 $?

Let’s test with $ p = 0 $ (Player 1 always plays A1):
- Player 2’s A0: $ 8(0) + 2 = 2 $
- Player 2’s A1: $ 16(0) + 4 = 4 $ → A1 better

With $ p = 1 $ (Player 1 always plays A0):
- Player 2’s A0: $ 8(1) + 2 = 10 $
- Player 2’s A1: $ 16(1) + 4 = 20 $ → A1 better

Wait — in fact, A1 dominates A0 for Player 2?

Compare A0 and A1 for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 10 (A0) vs 20 (A1) → A1 better
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 2 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → A1 better

So **no matter what Player 1 does, Player 2 gets more by playing A1**.

→ A1 **strictly dominates** A0 for Player 2.

Therefore, **Player 2 will always play A1** in equilibrium (since it's a dominant strategy).

That’s key.

---

### Step 4: Consequences for Optimal Play

Since Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play A1, we should assume they will play A1 with probability 1.

Therefore, we must choose our strategy **knowing that Player 2 plays A1**.

Given Player 2 always plays A1:

- If we play A0 → we get 0 points
- If we play A1 → we get 4 points

So clearly, **A1 is strictly better than A0**.

Therefore, our optimal strategy is to play **A1 with probability 100%**.

Even though A0 might look tempting in some cases, against a player who plays A1, A1 gives us 4 points, A0 gives 0. So we get a better outcome by always playing A1.

---

### Step 5: Verify no incentive to deviate

Suppose we play A0 100% → payoff is 0.

If we mix, say 50% A0, 50% A1:
- With 50% chance A0 → 0
- With 50% chance A1 → 4
→ Expected: 0.5*0 + 0.5*4 = 2 → worse than 4.

Any mixture gives less than 4.

So **best pure strategy is A1**.

Thus, we should choose **A1 with 100%**.

---

### Final Answer

We are playing without the contract (it was rejected), and the other player will play A1 (dominant strategy). Our best response is to play A1.

response:
Let me analyze this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

From my perspective as Player 2:

|  | Player 1 plays A0 | Player 1 plays A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **I play A0** | 10 | 2 |
| **I play A1** | 20 | 4 |

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract states: choosing A0 costs 1 point (paid to the other player), choosing A1 has no payment.

Modified payoffs for me (Player 2):
- **(A0, A0)**: 10 - 1 (I pay) + 1 (they pay) = **10**
- **(A1, A0)**: 20 + 0 (I pay) + 1 (they pay) = **21**
- **(A0, A1)**: 2 - 1 (I pay) + 0 (they pay) = **1**
- **(A1, A1)**: 4 + 0 + 0 = **4**

## Step 3: Analyze my optimal strategy

**Without contract:**
- If Player 1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (20 > 10)
- If Player 1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 2)
- **A1 is my dominant strategy**

**With contract:**
- If Player 1 plays A0: I prefer A1 (21 > 10)
- If Player 1 plays A1: I prefer A1 (4 > 1)
- **A1 is still my dominant strategy**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

Since A1 is my dominant strategy in both cases, and Player 1 (knowing this) will rationally choose A1, the equilibrium outcome is **(A1, A1)** in both scenarios.

**However**, comparing all possible outcomes:
- If Player 1 plays A0: I get **21 with contract** vs **20 without** → **+1 point**
- If Player 1 plays A1: I get **4 with contract** vs **4 without** → **same**

## Step 5: Decision

The contract makes me:
- **Better off** if Player 1 plays A0 (even by mistake/irrationality)
- **No worse off** in any scenario
- **No change** to the equilibrium outcome

Since I'm weakly better off with the contract in all cases, I should sign it.

response:
Let’s solve this decision-making game step by step, carefully considering the **original payoffs**, the **contract mechanism**, and the **strategic implications** for maximizing our total points as **Player 1**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Original Payoff Matrix (Before Contract)

The original game is a 2x2 simultaneous move game. Let's write the payoff matrix first (Player 1's payoff, then Player 2's):

|                  | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

This is not a symmetric game – Player 1’s payoffs differ from Player 2’s.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

> **Contract (proposed by Player 2, approved by both):**
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional 5 points**, drawn equally from the other player(s).
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

Since there are only two players, "drawn equally from the other players" means:
- If **you choose A0**, you gain **+5 points**.
- This **5 points is taken from the other player** (Player 2), so Player 2 loses 5 points.

This is a **transfer mechanism** tied to your choice.

So, the **actual final payoff** you receive from any outcome is:
> Original payoff + (5 if you chose A0, else 0)

Similarly, Player 2’s payoff is:
> Original payoff - (5 if you chose A0, else 0)

> **Note**: The contract applies **regardless of what the other player chooses**. It’s based solely on **your action**.

---

### Step 3: Rewrite the Payoff Matrix with Contract

Now we compute the **net payoffs** for Player 1 (you), **including the contract**.

Let’s define the **final payoff to Player 1** in each cell:

1. **You: A0, Opponent: A0**
   - Original: (10, 10)
   - You chose A0 → +5
   - Opponent chose A0 → they lose 5 (from contract)
   - So Player 1 gets: 10 + 5 = **15**
   - Player 2 gets: 10 - 5 = 5

2. **You: A0, Opponent: A1**
   - Original: (0, 20)
   - You chose A0 → +5
   - Opponent chose A1 → no penalty for them
   - So Player 1 gets: 0 + 5 = **5**
   - Player 2 gets: 20 - 0 = 20 (no cost to them)

3. **You: A1, Opponent: A0**
   - Original: (6, 2)
   - You chose A1 → no bonus
   - Opponent chose A0 → so they lose 5 (since you get the bonus, but wait...)

> Wait: **Important clarification: Who gets the 5 points?**

The contract says: **"If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players."**

So the 5 points are **from the other player**.

Thus:
- **If YOU choose A0**, you get +5, **and Player 2 loses 5**.
- If **Player 2 chooses A0**, then **Player 2 gets +5**, and **you lose 5**.

So the **contract affects both players** based on their own action.

Therefore, **both players** can gain 5 points **if they choose A0**, **at the expense of the other**.

So we must now compute **final payoffs** for **Player 1** accounting for:
- Original payoff
- +5 if **you** chose A0
- **-5 if the other player chose A0** (because they get +5 from the contract, so you lose 5)

So for **Player 1’s final payoff**, it is:

> Final Payoff = Original Payoff from game + (5 if you chose A0) - (5 if opponent chose A0)

So let’s recalculate the **final payoff matrix (Player 1)**:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Original Payoff | +5 if you chose A0? | -5 if opponent chose A0? | Final Payoff (You) |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 10               | +5                   | -5                        | 10 + 5 - 5 = **10** |
| A0          | A1                | 0                | +5                   | 0                         | 0 + 5 - 0 = **5**   |
| A1          | A0                | 6                | 0                    | -5                        | 6 + 0 - 5 = **1**   |
| A1          | A1                | 4                | 0                    | 0                         | 4 + 0 - 0 = **4**   |

> So the **effective payoff matrix for Player 1** is:

|                  | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**       | 10     | 5      |
| **P1: A1**       | 1      | 4      |

---

### Step 4: Analyze Strategic Implications

We now have the **actual payoff matrix after accounting for the contract**.

Player 1 wants to **maximize their expected payoff**.

Let’s denote:
- You (Player 1) choose A0 with probability **p**
- Opponent (Player 2) chooses A0 with probability **q**

Then your expected payoff is:

> E = p * q * 10  
> + p * (1 - q) * 5  
> + (1 - p) * q * 1  
> + (1 - p) * (1 - q) * 4

Let’s simplify this:

E = 10pq + 5p(1 - q) + 1(1 - p)q + 4(1 - p)(1 - q)

Expand:

= 10pq + 5p - 5pq + q - pq + 4(1 - p - q + pq)  
= 10pq + 5p - 5pq + q - pq + 4 - 4p - 4q + 4pq

Now combine like terms:

- pq terms: 10pq - 5pq - pq + 4pq = (10 - 5 - 1 + 4)pq = **8pq**
- p terms: 5p - 4p = **p**
- q terms: q - 4q = **-3q**
- constant: **4**

So:
> E = 8pq + p - 3q + 4

Now, since we are playing a simultaneous move game and we don’t know the opponent’s strategy, we need to consider **what strategy maximizes your minimum payoff** (worst-case), or **best response**, or **Nash equilibrium**.

But as **Player 1**, you are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming the other player also plays rationally.

Let’s suppose the other player is rational and will try to maximize their **own payoff**.

So we should consider what **Player 2** would do.

But first, let’s look at **Player 1’s best response** to any q (opponent’s A0 probability), and then find a **Nash equilibrium**.

---

### Step 5: Best Response for Player 1

Player 1 wants to maximize E = 8pq + p - 3q + 4

We can factor this as:
> E = p(8q + 1) - 3q + 4

This is **linear in p**, so optimal p depends on the coefficient of p: (8q + 1)

- If (8q + 1) > 0 → choose p = 1
- If (8q + 1) < 0 → choose p = 0
- If = 0 → indifferent

But 8q + 1 ≥ 1 (since q ≥ 0), so **8q + 1 > 0 always**

Therefore, for all q ∈ [0,1], the coefficient of p is positive → **Player 1 should always choose p = 1**

Wait! That would mean **Player 1 should always play A1**?

Wait, double-check:

E = p(8q + 1) - 3q + 4

Since (8q + 1) ≥ 1 > 0, E increases with p.

So **the best response for Player 1 is to always play A1 (p = 1)**, regardless of q.

So Player 1’s dominant strategy is to play A1?

But let’s test with an example.

Suppose q = 1 (opponent plays A0 always)

Then E = 8(1)(p) + p - 3(1) + 4 = 8p + p - 3 + 4 = 9p + 1

Max at p = 1 → E = 10

If p = 0 → E = 1 → much worse.

If q = 0 (opponent always A1)

E = 8(0)p + p - 0 + 4 = p + 4 → max at p = 1 → E = 5

If p = 0 → E = 4 → worse.

So yes — **for all q**, choosing p = 1 gives higher expected payoff.

So **A1 is a dominant strategy for Player 1**.

But wait — let’s double-check the final payoff matrix:

|         | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0  | 10     | 5      |
| P1: A1  | 1      | 4      |

So if P2 plays A0 (q = 1), you get 10 with A0, only 1 with A1 → **A0 is better!**

But according to the calculation, you should pick A1?

Contradiction!

Ah — **Mistake in sign** earlier.

Let’s go back.

When opponent plays A0, you **lose 5** because they get the +5 from the contract.

But in the case:
- You: A1, Opponent: A0 → original payoff = 6
- But opponent chose A0 → you **lose 5** → so final payoff = 6 - 5 = 1 → this is correct.

But when you play A0, you **gain 5**, but opponent also loses 5 if they play A0.

So in the case:
- You: A0, Opponent: A0 → you get original 10 + 5 (your bonus) - 5 (they lose 5) → 10

Wait, but **do you lose 5 to the contract when they play A0?**

No: the contract says:
> “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”

So:
- If **you** choose A0 → you gain +5.
- If **they** choose A0 → **they** gain +5 → **you lose 5**.

So the two effects are:
- Your action: if you choose A0 → you get +5.
- Their action: if they choose A0 → you lose 5.

So yes, both apply.

So for **You: A0**, **Opp: A0**:
- You: original 10 + 5 (you chose A0) - 5 (they chose A0, so you pay 5 to them) = 10 → correct.

But now, let’s look at the matrix again:

|         | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| P1: A0  | 10     | 5      |
| P1: A1  | 1      | 4      |

Wait — **A1 vs A0** when P2 plays A0:
- A0 gives 10
- A1 gives 1 → A0 much better

But earlier derivation said: E = p(8q + 1) - 3q + 4

Let’s plug q=1:

E = p(8*1 + 1) - 3*1 + 4 = 9p + 1

At p=1 → 10

At p=0 → 1 → correct

But if p=0, E = 1

But if p=0 (you play A1), and opponent plays A0 → you get 1 → correct

So E = 9p + 1 → increasing in p → better to play A1?

But 10 > 1, but if p=1, E=10, p=0, E=1 → so yes, **p=1 is better**

But wait: when p=1, you play A1 → get 1 when opponent plays A0 → but wait, no!

Ah! **Mistake here**.

If p=1 → you play A0 with probability 1 → so you are playing **A0**

But in the E expression, when p=1, and q=1 → E=10

But if you **play A0**, you get 10

But if you play A1, you get 1

So **you should play A0** to get 10

But in the E formula, E = 9p + 1 → for p=1 → 10, for p=0 → 1 → still says p=1 is better

But p is the probability of choosing A0!

So **p=1 → you play A0** → correct

So E increases with p → so you should set p=1 → play A0

But earlier I thought A1 was dominant — no, **A0 is better** in some cases.

But let’s test q = 0 (opponent plays A1 always)

Then E = 8p*0 + p - 0 + 4 = p + 4

At p=0 → 4
At p=1 → 5

So still better to play A0 (p=1)

So regardless of q, E increases with p.

Let’s verify.

E = 8pq + p - 3q + 4 = p(8q + 1) - 3q + 4

Now, derivative w.r.t p is (8q + 1) ≥ 1 > 0 → so **E increases with p for all q**

Therefore, **for any strategy q of Player 2, your best response is to set p = 1**

→ **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1**

Even though when opponent plays A0, **A0 gives you 10**, A1 gives you only 1 — and when opponent plays A1, A0 gives you 5, A1 gives you 4.

So yes — in **both cases**, A0 is better for you.

Therefore: **Player 1 should always play A0**

Even though the contract might seem complex, because:
- You gain 5 if you play A0
- You lose 5 if they play A0
But overall, the net effect still makes A0 **dominant** for you.

Let’s verify with the four cases:

- You A0, Opp A0: You get 10 (10 + 5 - 5)
- You A0, Opp A1: You get 5 (0 + 5 - 0)
- You A1, Opp A0: You get 1 (6 + 0 - 5)
- You A1, Opp A1: You get 4 (4 + 0 - 0)

So in **every case**, A0 gives you more than A1:
- 10 > 1
- 5 > 4

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 1.

Therefore, **your optimal strategy is to play A0 with probability 100%, A1 with 0%**

---

### Step 6: Consider Player 2’s Behavior?

Even though we’re maximizing our own payoff, is there a possibility that Player 2 might deviate?

But since we’re playing a simultaneous move game, and we don’t know their strategy, we must assume rationality.

But since A0 is dominant for us, we should play it regardless.

Also, note that the contract was **proposed by Player 2**, which might suggest they want to encourage A0, but we don't need to worry about it — we only care about maximizing **our** points.

And since A0 is **dominant**, we should play it.

---

### Final Decision:

Play **A0** with **100%** probability, **A1** with **0%**.

This maximizes your expected payoff in all cases.

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Let's analyze this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

We have a simultaneous move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|          | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (10, 10)     | (0, 20)      |
| **Player 1: A1** | (6, 2)       | (4, 4)       |

This is a classic coordination-like game with a conflict of interest.

Let’s analyze Nash equilibria without the contract.

---

### Step 2: Find Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria

- **(A0, A0)**:  
  - P1: 10  
  - P2: 10  
  - If P1 deviates to A1: gets 6 < 10 → no incentive  
  - If P2 deviates to A1: gets 20 > 10 → has incentive  
  → Not a NE

- **(A0, A1)**:  
  - P1: 0  
  - P2: 20  
  - P1 wants to switch: A1 gives 4 > 0 → yes  
  - P2: if switches to A0: gets 10 < 20 → no  
  → Not a NE

- **(A1, A0)**:  
  - P1: 6  
  - P2: 2  
  - P1: A0 gives 10 > 6 → wants to deviate  
  - P2: A1 gives 20 > 2 → wants to deviate  
  → Not NE

- **(A1, A1)**:  
  - P1: 4  
  - P2: 4  
  - P1 deviates to A0: gets 0 < 4 → no  
  - P2 deviates to A0: gets 2 < 4 → no  
  → **This is a pure NE**

So only pure strategy NE is (A1, A1), giving both 4 points.

Now check for mixed strategy NE.

Let:
- P1 plays A0 with probability p
- P2 plays A0 with probability q

We want to find mixed strategy where both are indifferent.

#### For P2 to be indifferent:
- Expected payoff from A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2
- Expected payoff from A1: 0p + 4(1-p) = 4 - 4p

Set equal:  
8p + 2 = 4 - 4p  
12p = 2 → p = 1/6

#### For P1 to be indifferent:
- P1's payoff from A0: 10q + 0(1-q) = 10q
- P1's payoff from A1: 6q + 4(1-q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4

Set equal:  
10q = 2q + 4 → 8q = 4 → q = 0.5

So there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:
- P1 plays A0 with 1/6, A1 with 5/6
- P2 plays A0 with 1/2, A1 with 1/2

Expected payoff for P1 in this equilibrium:
- From A0: 10*(0.5) = 5
- From A1: 6*(0.5) + 4*(0.5) = 3 + 2 = 5 → so overall expected payoff = 5
(Same for P2: 10*1/6 + 2*5/6 ≈ 1.67 + 1.67 = 3.33? Wait, let’s compute properly.)

Wait — in mixed NE, each player is indifferent, so expected payoff is the same across actions.

For P1:
- Expected payoff = 10q = 10*(1/2) = 5
- Also: 6q + 4(1-q) = 6*0.5 + 4*0.5 = 3 + 2 = 5 → yes

For P2:
- A0: 10p + 2(1-p) = 10*(1/6) + 2*(5/6) = 10/6 + 10/6 = 20/6 ≈ 3.33
- A1: 0*p + 4(1-p) = 4*(5/6) = 20/6 ≈ 3.33

So expected payoff:
- P1: 5
- P2: 20/6 ≈ 3.33

So in mixed strategy NE, Player 1 gets 5, Player 2 gets ~3.33

Now, without contract, possible outcomes:
- Pure strategy NE: (A1,A1) → (4,4)
- Mixed NE: (5, 3.33)

So player 1 could get 4 or 5, depending on strategy.

But in absence of communication, we don’t know what the other will do.

But now comes the **contract**.

---

### Step 3: Understand the Contract

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Since this is a two-player game, "other players" is just one other player.

So:
- If you choose A0: you gain +10 points; opponent loses 10 points.
- If you choose A1: you pay -10 points; opponent gains +10 points.

This is a **transfer-based contract** that shifts wealth depending on your action.

Note: The contract is only active if **both players sign it**.

You are deciding whether to sign it.

So if you sign, and the other player signs → contract is active.

If you don’t sign, even if the other signs → contract inactive.

So outcome depends on your decision.

---

### Step 4: Evaluate How the Contract Changes the Game

Let’s suppose **both players sign the contract**.

Then, payoffs are modified:

New payoffs = base payoffs + contract adjustment

Let’s recompute the full payoff matrix under contract.

#### Case 1: (A0, A0)
- Base: (10,10)
- Contract: Both choose A0 → both gain +10
- New: (10+10, 10+10) = (20, 20)

#### Case 2: (A0, A1)
- Base: (0, 20)
- Contract: P1 (A0) gains +10; P2 (A1) pays -10 → so P2 loses 10
- New: (0+10, 20–10) = (10, 10)

#### Case 3: (A1, A0)
- Base: (6, 2)
- Contract: P1 (A1) pays -10; P2 (A0) gains +10
- New: (6–10, 2+10) = (-4, 12)

#### Case 4: (A1, A1)
- Base: (4, 4)
- Contract: Both pay -10
- New: (4–10, 4–10) = (-6, -6)

Now, the **modified payoff matrix** is:

|               | P2: A0      | P2: A1      |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (20, 20)    | (10, 10)    |
| **P1: A1**    | (-4, 12)    | (-6, -6)    |

Now, analyze this new game.

---

### Step 5: Analyze the Contracted Game (Both Sign)

We now look for Nash equilibria in this new game.

#### Check (A0, A0): (20,20)
- P1: if deviates to A1 → gets -4 < 20 → no
- P2: if deviates to A1 → gets 10 < 20 → no
→ **Pure NE**

#### Check (A0, A1): (10,10)
- P1: if deviates to A1 → gets -6 < 10 → no
- P2: if deviates to A0 → gets 20 > 10 → yes → not NE

#### Check (A1, A0): (-4,12)
- P1: if deviates to A0 → gets 20 > -4 → yes → not NE
- P2: if deviates to A1 → gets -6 < 12 → no → but P1 wants to deviate

#### Check (A1, A1): (-6,-6)
- P1: if deviates to A0 → gets 10 > -6 → yes → not NE

So only pure NE is **(A0, A0)** → (20,20)

Now check mixed strategies?

Let’s see if it's stable.

But notice: (A0, A0) gives both players 20 — far better than base game (4,4).

Is there any incentive to deviate?

No — both players strictly better off playing A0.

So if the contract is active, **(A0, A0)** becomes the only pure NE, and it's very attractive.

So if both sign, the game is likely to result in (A0, A0), giving each 20 points.

---

### Step 6: What if YOU don’t sign?

Then, even if the other player signs, **contract is inactive**.

So the game reverts to base payoffs.

So, your payoff depends on what the other player does — and whether they sign.

But the contract is proposed and passed via approval voting, so we assume the **other player has decided to sign** (since it passed).

But you are deciding: **to sign or not**.

So we must consider:

- If you sign → contract active → game becomes the modified one → both play A0 → you get 20
- If you don’t sign → contract inactive → base game → you get whatever from base game

But now: if you don't sign, and the other signs, the contract doesn’t apply → so only the other player is bound? No — **contract requires all players to sign**.

So if *you* don't sign, then contract is **not active**.

Even if the other player wants it, it doesn't happen.

So in that case, the game is the **original** game.

So now: you must consider your best response in the original game, anticipating what the other player will do.

But the other player **wants** to sign — because they believe it helps.

But they can only get the contract if *both* sign.

But now, you are a rational player trying to **maximize your own expected points**.

So let's consider:

### Option 1: You sign the contract
→ Contract active → game becomes modified one → equilibrium is (A0, A0) → you get **20**

### Option 2: You do NOT sign
→ Contract inactive → original game → no contract

So game is base game.

Now, the other player has expressed willingness to sign (since contract passed), so they would prefer to have the contract active → so they probably want to play A0, since in the contract game, A0 is beneficial.

But **if you don't sign**, the contract doesn't work, so the other player might still play A0, A1 — but without contract, A0 is risky.

Let’s think: in the **original game**, what should the other player do?

In original game, without contract:
- (A0,A0): (10,10)
- (A0,A1): (0,20)
- (A1,A0): (6,2)
- (A1,A1): (4,4)

If the other player (P2) believes you will play A0, they prefer A1 (20 > 10)

If they think you play A1, they prefer A0 (2 > 4? Wait: if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 2 from A0 vs 4 from A1 → so prefers A1)

So P2's best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 best: A1 (20 > 10)
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 best: A1 (4 > 2)

So **A1 is dominant strategy for P2**.

Similarly, P1's best response:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0 (10 > 6)
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 prefers A1 (4 > 0)

So no dominant strategy.

But P2 has dominant strategy: A1

So if you don’t sign → contract inactive → P2 will play A1 (since it dominates)

Now, if P2 plays A1, what should you do?

- If you play A0: get 0
- If you play A1: get 4

So you choose A1 → get 4

So in this case: if you **don’t sign**, then:
- P2 plays A1 (dominant)
- You play A1 (best response to P2’s A1)
- Final outcome: (A1,A1) → you get 4

Whereas if you **sign**, you get **20**

Clearly, 20 > 4

So signing gives you 20, not signing gives you 4

So you should **sign**

But wait — is there a risk?

Suppose you sign → contract active → but now, could P2 deviate?

In the contracted game, we found that (A0, A0) is a NE → both playing A0.

But could P2 be tempted to play A1?

In contracted game:
- If you play A0, P2:
  - A0 → 20
  - A1 → 10
  → prefers A0

So P2 has no incentive to deviate.

Similarly, you prefer A0 → 20 > -4 if you play A1

So (A0, A0) is stable.

Thus, with contract, both will play A0 → you get 20.

If you don’t sign → contract inactive → P2 plays A1 (dominant) → you play A1 → get 4

So difference: 20 vs 4

Even if you’re skeptical, you can’t get more than 4 if you don’t sign, because P2 will play A1.

But if you sign → you get 20

So signing is **strictly better**

---

### Step 7: Final Decision

- Signing → you get 20
- Not signing → you get 4 (at best)

Even though the contract makes A1 very bad for you (leads to -6), the equilibrium pushes everyone to A0, which is great.

So you should sign.

There is no risk in signing — the contract makes it beneficial to coordinate on A0.

Also, if the other player is rational, they will want to sign too, because they also get 20 → better than 4 in the base game.

So the contract enables better coordination.

Thus, you should sign.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
To determine the best strategy for maximizing my points in this game, let's break down the problem step by step by considering all aspects including the payoffs and the additional payment contract.

### Step 1: Understanding the Payoffs and Contract
First, let's understand the basic payoffs without the contract:
- If both players choose A0:
  - I get 10 points
  - The other player gets 10 points.
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - I get 20 points
  - The other player gets 0 points.
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - I get 2 points
  - The other player gets 6 points.
- If both players choose A1:
  - I get 4 points
  - The other player gets 4 points.

### Step 2: Incorporating the Payment Contract into the Payoffs
If I choose A0, I get an additional payment of 10 points taken from the other player. If I choose A1, I pay 10 points to the other player.

Revised Payoffs:
- Both choose A0:
  - I get 10 + 10 = 20 points
  - The other player gets 10 - 10 = 0 points.
- I choose A1, the other player chooses A0:
  - I get 20 - 10 = 10 points
  - The other player gets 0 + 10 = 10 points.
- I choose A0, the other player chooses A1:
  - I get 2 + 10 = 12 points
  - The other player gets 6 - 10 = -4 points.
- Both choose A1:
  - I get 4 - 10 = -6 points
  - The other player gets 4 + 10 = 14 points.

### Step 3: Determine an Optimal Strategy
Now that we have the updated payoffs, let's determine which strategy yields the best outcome.

For Player 2:
1. Considering A0:
   - If Player 1 (the other player) chooses A0: I get 20 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1: I get 12 points.

2. Considering A1:
   - If Player 1 chooses A0: I get 10 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1: I get -6 points.

By comparing the outcomes, it's clear that choosing A0 is more beneficial to me in almost all cases as it results in higher points regardless of the other player's choice.

### Step 4: Final Strategy Decision
Given all the analysis:
- The probability distribution should heavily favor choosing A0 because it provides a higher guaranteed payoff.

**Final Answer:**
```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

By choosing A0 with 100% probability, I maximize my expected payoff considering both the payoff matrix and the additional payment contract.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the optimal probability distribution over actions A0 and A1 for **Player 2**, given that:

- You are **Player 2**.
- The **payment contract proposed by Player 2 was rejected**, so it is **not active**.
- You are playing the **original game** with the given payoffs.
- You must choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 (i.e., assign percentages to each action, summing to 100).
- The goal is to **maximize your expected points**, assuming the other player (Player 1) is also rational and will also choose optimally.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix
We are told that you are **Player 2**. Let's write the payoff matrix from **Player 2's perspective**.

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0      | A1      |
|---------------------|---------|---------|
| **A0**              | 10      | 2       |
| **A1**              | 20      | 4       |

Wait: Let’s double-check with the original description:

- **You choose A0, other player chooses A0**: You get 10 → (A0, A0) → (10, 10)
- **You choose A1, other player chooses A0**: You get 20 → (A1, A0) → (20, 0)
- **You choose A0, other player chooses A1**: You get 2 → (A0, A1) → (2, 6)
- **You choose A1, other player chooses A1**: You get 4 → (A1, A1) → (4, 4)

So the matrix from **Player 2’s** point of view is:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 10 | 2  |
| A1     | 20 | 4  |

Yes.

---

### Step 2: Determine if there’s a Nash Equilibrium

We want to find a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, because both players are rational and will optimize.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ be the probability that **Player 1** chooses A0.
- Let $ q $ be the probability that **Player 2** chooses A0.
- Then Player 2 chooses A1 with probability $ 1 - q $.

We will find a strategy $ q $ for Player 2 such that **Player 1 is indifferent** between choosing A0 and A1, or vice versa, or we can find a best response.

But since we are trying to **maximize our own expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 is also optimizing, we look for the **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s find Player 1’s best response to Player 2’s choice.

#### Player 1's Expected Payoffs:
- If Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Their payoff = $ q \cdot 10 + (1 - q) \cdot 20 $
    - Because if Player 2 plays A0 (prob q), payoff is 10; if A1 (prob 1−q), payoff is 0 (from the original).
  - Wait: No — we must be careful.

Hold on! We have a mistake.

The **payoffs are given from Player 2's perspective**, but **Player 1’s payoffs are also present in the description**.

So, we need to reconstruct the **full payoff matrix** for both players.

Let’s make it clear.

From the setup:

| P2 \ P1 | A0         | A1         |
|--------|------------|------------|
| A0     | (10, 10)   | (2, 6)     |
| A1     | (20, 0)    | (4, 4)     |

So both players get:
- (10, 10) when both play A0
- (2, 6) when P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1
- (20, 0) when P2 plays A1, P1 plays A0
- (4, 4) when both play A1

So now, we can model both players.

We are **Player 2**, and we want to choose $ q $ = P(P2 chooses A0), to **maximize our expected payoff**, assuming **Player 1 is rational and will play optimally**.

So we need to find the **Nash equilibrium** of this game.

---

### Step 3: Find Nash Equilibrium

Let’s suppose:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ p $
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability $ q $

We will find a mixed strategy equilibrium where both players are indifferent between their actions.

---

#### Step 3.1: Find Player 1’s best response to q.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Payoff = $ q \cdot 10 + (1 - q) \cdot 0 = 10q $
- If Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Payoff = $ q \cdot 6 + (1 - q) \cdot 4 = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4 $

Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 when:
$ 10q = 2q + 4 $
→ $ 8q = 4 $
→ $ q = 0.5 $

So if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.5, Player 1 is indifferent.

Therefore, **Player 1’s best response** is to play A0 with probability $ p $, but if $ q = 0.5 $, then Player 1 is indifferent — any mix is a best response. But for equilibrium, we can suppose Player 1 chooses a $ p $ that makes **Player 2** indifferent.

Now go the other way.

---

#### Step 3.2: Find Player 2’s best response to p.

Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Payoff = $ p \cdot 10 + (1 - p) \cdot 2 = 10p + 2 - 2p = 8p + 2 $
- If Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Payoff = $ p \cdot 20 + (1 - p) \cdot 4 = 20p + 4 - 4p = 16p + 4 $

Player 2 is indifferent when:
$ 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 $
→ $ -8p = 2 $
→ $ p = -0.25 $? Impossible.

This suggests **no full mixed strategy equilibrium** where both are indifferent? Wait — that can’t be right.

Let’s check: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 ⇒ -8p = 2 ⇒ p = -1/4 — impossible.

That means Player 2 **never** wants to be indifferent — and the best response is always to play pure strategy, depending on p.

Let’s examine:

Compare $ 8p + 2 $ and $ 16p + 4 $

Set $ 8p + 2 > 16p + 4 $? ⇒ $ -8p > 2 $ ⇒ $ p < -0.25 $ — never true

So $ 8p + 2 < 16p + 4 $ for all $ p \in [0,1] $

Wait: Let’s compute at p=0:
- A0: 0 + 2 = 2
- A1: 0 + 4 = 4 → A1 better

At p=1:
- A0: 8 + 2 = 10
- A1: 16 + 4 = 20 → A1 better

Wait — is A1 **always better** than A0 for Player 2?

Check: $ 16p + 4 - (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 > 0 $ for all $ p \in [0,1] $

So $ E[\text{A1}] > E[\text{A0}] $ for all p.

So **Player 2 always prefers A1**, no matter what Player 1 does!

Wait — is that true?

At p=0 (Player 1 plays A1 always):
- A0: 2
- A1: 4 → yes, A1 better

At p=1 (Player 1 plays A0 always):
- A0: 10
- A1: 20 → A1 still better

So yes — for **any** strategy of Player 1, **Player 2's best response is to always play A1**.

So **A1 strictly dominates A0** for Player 2.

But wait — is that right?

Compare: For A0 vs A1, given Player 1 plays A0 with prob p:
- Expected from A0: $ 10p + 2(1-p) = 8p + 2 $
- Expected from A1: $ 20p + 4(1-p) = 16p + 4 $

Now, is $ 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 $ for all p?
→ $ 8p + 2 > 0 $? Yes, since p ≥ 0.

→ So 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 always.

So yes — **A1 strictly dominates A0** for Player 2.

Therefore, **no matter what Player 1 does**, Player 2 gets strictly higher payoff by playing A1.

So the optimal strategy for Player 2 is to play **A1 with probability 100%**.

But wait — what about Player 1? Is there a best response?

Let’s see.

Now, if Player 2 **always plays A1**, then Player 1 has:
- If Player 1 plays A0: get 0
- If Player 1 plays A1: get 4

So Player 1 will prefer A1.

So if Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 plays A1.

And if both play A1, the outcome is (4,4).

But suppose Player 2 plays A1 always, then Player 1's best response is A1.

So (A1, A1) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

But is there a better one?

Suppose Player 2 plays A1 always → outcome (A1, A1) → Player 2 gets 4.

But if Player 2 could get more — for example, if Player 1 played A0, Player 2 would get 20.

But Player 1, when faced with A1 from Player 2, will not play A0 because A0 gives them 0, while A1 gives them 4 — so they prefer A1.

So Player 1 will never play A0 if Player 2 plays A1.

Hence, Player 2 cannot get 20 — because Player 1 will not cooperate.

Could Player 2 do **better** by randomizing?

Suppose Player 2 plays A0 with some probability.

But we already established: for **any** p (Player 1’s mix), A1 gives strictly higher expected payoff than A0.

Hence, A1 strictly dominates A0.

Therefore, **Player 2 should play A1 with 100% probability**.

No matter what, it gives higher payoff than A0.

Even in the case where Player 1 plays A0 (which gives Player 2 20), but Player 1 will never play A0 when Player 2 plays A1.

But if Player 2 plays A0, then Player 1 is better off playing A1 (gets 6 vs 10), so Player 1 will play A1 → Player 2 gets only 2.

If Player 2 plays a mix, say some A0, then:
- When P2 plays A0, P1 will play A1 (since 6 > 10? No — wait: from P1’s perspective, when P2 plays A0, their choices:
  - A0: get 10
  - A1: get 6 → so P1 prefers A0!

Ah! Here is a critical point we missed.

Let’s re-analyze **Player 1’s preferences**.

From the payoff matrix:
- When P2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 10 if they play A0
  - P1 gets 6 if they play A1 → so P1 prefers A0

- When P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 0 if they play A0
  - P1 gets 4 if they play A1 → so P1 prefers A1

So P1's best response to P2:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 plays A0
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 plays A1

So P1 will mirror P2’s choice.

Therefore, the **only possible outcomes** are:
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 plays A0 → outcome (A0,A0) → (10,10)
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 plays A1 → outcome (A1,A1) → (4,4)

There is no way for P1 to deviate and get a better payoff.

So P2’s expected payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: 10
- If P2 plays A1: 4

So P2 should choose A0!

Because 10 > 4.

But earlier we said A1 dominates — that was wrong.

**Where was the mistake?**

We incorrectly assumed that Player 1 would mix in a way that makes the calculation valid.

But in reality, **player 1 has a pure best response**: play the same as P2.

Thus, the game reduces to:
- If P2 chooses A0 → P1 chooses A0 → P2 gets 10
- If P2 chooses A1 → P1 chooses A1 → P2 gets 4

Hence, **P2 gets higher payoff by choosing A0**.

So P2 should play A0 with probability 1.

But wait — what if P2 mixes? Let’s suppose P2 plays A0 with probability q.

Then:
- With probability q: P2 plays A0 → P1 responds with A0 → P2 gets 10
- With probability (1−q): P2 plays A1 → P1 responds with A1 → P2 gets 4

So expected payoff for P2:
$ q \cdot 10 + (1 - q) \cdot 4 = 10q + 4 - 4q = 6q + 4 $

This is **increasing in q**.

So maximum at $ q = 1 $ → payoff = 10

Therefore, **optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability**

So the answer should be: {"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

But let’s double-check.

Is there any reason for P2 to play A1?

Only if P1 fails to respond optimally.

But we assume both players are rational and will choose best responses.

And since P1 best responds by matching P2’s action, P2 cannot gain by playing A1 — in fact, it’s worse.

So P2 should play A0.

But wait — what if P2 plays A1, and P1 thinks P2 might be randomizing, but in equilibrium, P1 always matches.

So yes.

Therefore, the optimal strategy for Player 2 is to play A0 with probability 100%.

---

### Final Step: Contract Information

The contract was:
- If a player chooses A0, they get +11 points (drawn from the other player).
- If A1, no extra.

But it was **rejected by Player 2** — so it is **not active**.

Therefore, we ignore it.

Even if it were active, it was rejected by "Player 2" — i.e., **you** — so you are not bound by it.

Hence, you play the **original game**.

---

### Conclusion:

The optimal strategy for Player 2 is to play **A0 with 100% probability**, since it leads to a higher expected payoff (10) than playing A1 (4), given that Player 1 will best respond by playing the same action.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Without the Contract**

We are playing a simultaneous move game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses a probability distribution over actions **A0** and **A1**, and then the actions are drawn randomly based on those probabilities.

The payoff matrix (from Player 1's perspective):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0        | A1        |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**               | 10, 10    | 0, 20     |
| **A1**               | 6, 2      | 4, 4      |

We are Player 1, and our goal is to **maximize our expected points**, regardless of what Player 2 does. However, since we don't know Player 2's strategy, we need to choose a probability distribution over A0 and A1 that best optimizes our expected payoff, ideally considering equilibrium reasoning.

Note: The contract was proposed but rejected by Player 2, so it is **not active**. We play the **original** game as described.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Game – Find Best Response and Nash Equilibrium**

Let’s suppose:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability **p** (so A1 with probability **1−p**)
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability **q** (so A1 with probability **1−q**)

We want to find Player 1’s expected payoff as a function of **p** and **q**:

Expected payoff for Player 1:
- If Player 2 chooses A0 (prob q):  
  - If Player 1 plays A0: 10  
  - If Player 1 plays A1: 6  
  → Contribution: p×10 + (1−p)×6 = 6 + 4p
- If Player 2 chooses A1 (prob 1−q):  
  - If Player 1 plays A0: 0  
  - If Player 1 plays A1: 4  
  → Contribution: p×0 + (1−p)×4 = 4(1−p)

So total expected payoff for Player 1:
> E₁ = q(6 + 4p) + (1−q)(4(1−p))

Simplify:
> E₁ = q(6 + 4p) + (1−q)(4 − 4p)  
> = 6q + 4pq + 4 − 4p − 4q + 4pq  
> = (6q − 4q) + 4pq + 4pq + 4 − 4p  
> = 2q + 8pq + 4 − 4p

Wait — let's redo that carefully:

Expand:
> E₁ = q(6 + 4p) + (1−q)(4 − 4p)  
> = 6q + 4pq + (4 − 4p) − q(4 − 4p)  
> = 6q + 4pq + 4 − 4p − 4q + 4pq  
> = (6q − 4q) + (4pq + 4pq) + 4 − 4p  
> = 2q + 8pq + 4 − 4p

Wait — that still looks messy. Let's group terms differently.

Better to keep it as:
> E₁ = q(6 + 4p) + (1−q)(4 − 4p)

Now expand fully:
> = 6q + 4pq + 4(1−q) − 4p(1−q)  
> = 6q + 4pq + 4 − 4q − 4p + 4pq  
> = (6q − 4q) + (4pq + 4pq) + 4 − 4p  
> = 2q + 8pq + 4 − 4p

Still complex.

Actually, let’s approach this differently — **find the best response of Player 1 to any strategy of Player 2**, and then find a symmetric or stable solution.

Alternatively, let’s **check for pure strategy Nash equilibria**.

---

### **Step 3: Check for Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria**

1. **(A0, A0):**  
   - Player 1: 10  
   - If Player 1 deviates to A1: gets 6 < 10 → no incentive  
   - Player 2: 10  
   - If Player 2 deviates to A1: gets 20 > 10 → **incentive to deviate**  
   → Not NE

2. **(A0, A1):**  
   - Player 1: 0  
   - If Player 1 deviates to A1: gets 4 > 0 → incentive  
   - Player 2: 20  
   - If Player 2 deviates to A0: gets 10 < 20 → no incentive  
   → Not NE (Player 1 wants to deviate)

3. **(A1, A0):**  
   - Player 1: 6  
   - If Player 1 deviates to A0: gets 10 > 6 → incentive  
   - Player 2: 2  
   - If Player 2 deviates to A1: gets 4 > 2 → incentive  
   → Not NE

4. **(A1, A1):**  
   - Player 1: 4  
   - If Player 1 deviates to A0: gets 0 < 4 → no incentive  
   - Player 2: 4  
   - If Player 2 deviates to A0: gets 10 > 4 → incentive  
   → Not NE

So **no pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 4: Look for Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**

Let’s find a mixed strategy equilibrium where both players randomize optimally.

Let Player 1 play A0 with probability **p**, A1 with **1−p**.

Let Player 2 play A0 with probability **q**, A1 with **1−q**.

We want to find p and q such that each player is indifferent between their actions, given the other’s strategy.

---

#### **Player 2’s Indifference Condition:**

For Player 2 to be willing to mix, Player 1’s strategy must make Player 2 indifferent between A0 and A1.

Player 2’s expected payoff:

- If Player 2 plays A0:  
  - With prob p: Player 1 plays A0 → payoff = 10  
  - With prob 1−p: Player 1 plays A1 → payoff = 2  
  → Expected: 10p + 2(1−p) = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2

- If Player 2 plays A1:  
  - With prob p: Player 1 plays A0 → payoff = 20  
  - With prob 1−p: Player 1 plays A1 → payoff = 4  
  → Expected: 20p + 4(1−p) = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set them equal for indifference:
> 8p + 2 = 16p + 4  
> 2 − 4 = 16p − 8p  
> −2 = 8p  
> p = −0.25

Wait! **Negative probability? Impossible.**

That means **Player 2 will never be indifferent** — they will **always prefer A1** unless Player 1 plays A0 with very high probability.

But getting a negative p means that **Player 2’s best response to any p in [0,1]** is to play **A1**, unless...

Wait — let’s re-analyze.

From above:
- E₂(A0) = 8p + 2
- E₂(A1) = 16p + 4

Compare them:
E₂(A1) − E₂(A0) = (16p + 4) − (8p + 2) = 8p + 2 > 0 for all p ≥ 0

So **E₂(A1) > E₂(A0) for all p in [0,1]**, meaning that **Player 2 always prefers A1**, no matter what Player 1 does.

So **Player 2’s best response is always A1** (pure strategy).

That’s a key insight.

So regardless of what Player 1 does, **Player 2 will always choose A1** to maximize their own payoff.

But is that true?

Let’s verify with actual numbers.

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with p=1 (pure A0):

- Player 2: A0 → 10, A1 → 20 → prefers A1

p=0 (Player 1 plays A1):

- Player 2: A0 → 2, A1 → 4 → prefers A1

p=0.5:
- A0: 10×0.5 + 2×0.5 = 5 + 1 = 6
- A1: 20×0.5 + 4×0.5 = 10 + 2 = 12 → still prefers A1

Yes, so **Player 2 always gets strictly higher payoff from A1**, no matter what Player 1 does.

⇒ So **Player 2 will always play A1** (in any equilibrium).

Now, given that Player 2 always plays A1, what should **Player 1 do?**

Best response of Player 1 when Player 2 plays A1:

- If Player 1 plays A0: gets 0
- If Player 1 plays A1: gets 4

So **Player 1’s best response is A1**, getting 4 > 0.

So if Player 2 plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1

But wait — earlier we saw that if Player 1 plays A1, and Player 2 plays A1 → both get 4, which is worse than if Player 1 played A0 and Player 2 played A0 (10 each), but **Player 2 won’t choose A0**, because it’s worse for them.

So, in **rational play**, Player 2 will **always play A1**, and then Player 1 will respond with **A1**, leading to (A1, A1), payoff (4,4)

But is this an equilibrium?

- Player 2: if Player 1 plays A1, then Player 2’s payoffs are: A0 → 2, A1 → 4 → prefers A1 → yes, no incentive to deviate
- Player 1: if Player 2 plays A1, then A0 → 0, A1 → 4 → prefers A1 → no incentive

So **(A1, A1)** is a **Nash equilibrium** — even if it's not Pareto efficient, it is a stable outcome.

But is it the **only** equilibrium?

We saw that Player 2 will never play A0 in any equilibrium because A1 always gives strictly higher payoff.

Therefore, **in any Nash equilibrium, Player 2 must play A1 with probability 1**.

Then, given that, Player 1’s best response is to play A1 (gets 4 vs 0), so Player 1 plays A1 with probability 1.

Thus, the **only Nash equilibrium is (A1, A1)**.

Therefore, **we should play A1 with probability 100%**.

But wait — the game is played with **probabilities**, and the opponent might not be rational? But we are supposed to **maximize our own expected payoff**, assuming the other player is also rational and trying to maximize their own payoff.

So in a rational setting, we expect Player 2 to play A1, so we should play A1.

But could we do better by mixing?

Suppose we play A0 with some probability. Then, if Player 2 plays A1 (which they always do), then:

- When we play A0: we get 0
- When we play A1: we get 4

So expected payoff if we play A0 with prob p, A1 with 1−p:

> E = p×0 + (1−p)×4 = 4(1−p)

This is maximized when **p = 0**, i.e., play A1 with 100%.

So **any mixing hurts us** if Player 2 is playing A1.

Therefore, **best response is A1 with probability 100%**.

But wait — could Player 2 be irrational or strategic in a different way?

But in game theory, we assume players act rationally to maximize payoff.

And we’ve confirmed that **A1 is strictly dominant for Player 2** (since A1 always gives higher payoff than A0, regardless of what Player 1 does).

Now, is A1 dominant for Player 1?

Let’s see:

Player 1’s payoffs:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - A0: 10
  - A1: 6 → A0 better
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - A0: 0
  - A1: 4 → A1 better

So **Player 1 has no dominant strategy**, but **Player 2 does** — A1 strictly dominates A0.

So Player 2 will play A1.

Thus, Player 1 should play best response to A1 → A1.

So we should play **A1 with probability 100%**.

---

### **Step 5: Final Decision**

We are to output a probability distribution over A0 and A1, summing to 100.

We conclude: **Play A1 with 100%, A0 with 0%**

This maximizes our expected payoff, assuming Player 2 is rational and will play A1.

Even if Player 2 is not rational, we’re trying to **maximize expected points**, and assuming rational behavior is standard unless told otherwise.

And since the game is simultaneous, we can’t condition on behavior — but we can assume mutual rationality.

Thus, optimal strategy is to play A1 with probability 100.

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

We are in a simultaneous-move game between two players (Player 1 and Player 2). Each chooses an action: A0 or A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

| Your Choice \ Other's Choice | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| A0                            | (10, 10)   | (0, 20)    |
| A1                            | (6, 2)     | (4, 4)     |

This is a coordination game with a conflict of interest. Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria and player incentives.

#### Best Responses:
- If other plays A0:
  - You get 10 for A0, 6 for A1 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1:
  - You get 0 for A0, 4 for A1 → prefer A1

So best responses are:
- If other plays A0 → you play A0
- If other plays A1 → you play A1

Now, check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both are best responding → Nash
- (A1, A1): both are best responding → Nash
- (A0, A1): you would want to deviate to A1 → not equilibrium
- (A1, A0): you would want to deviate to A0 → not equilibrium

So two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Mixed strategy equilibrium exists too, but we can evaluate expected payoffs based on strategies.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract

The contract says:
- If a player chooses A0, they pay **1 point**, which is **distributed equally among the other players**.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payment.

Since this is a two-player game, the "other players" is just the single opponent.

So:
- If you play A0 → you lose 1 point (pay 1 point), and your opponent gains 1 point.
- If you play A1 → no additional cost or gain.

This is a **Punishment for choosing A0**.

Let’s recompute payoffs with the contract applied.

Note: This contract is **in force only if both players sign**. Since you are deciding whether to sign, we must evaluate: **If I sign, will it improve my expected payoff, assuming the other player may or may not sign?**

But the contract becomes active **only if all players sign**.

So:
- If **only you sign**, the contract does **not** apply.
- If **both sign**, the contract **does** apply.
- If **neither signs**, no contract → base game.

So your decision to sign depends on your **beliefs** about whether the other player will sign.

But in the setup, **you are told that the contract was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1)**.

So the contract exists, but now you must decide whether to sign.

However, **there is no information about the other player’s decision**.

To make a rational decision, we must assume that:
- The other player also makes a decision based on their own self-interest.
- Therefore, we must consider the possibility of **mutual signing** (and thus contract applies), or only one signing, or neither.

But note: The contract is **only active if all sign**. So the outcome depends on whether both agree.

But since we are told that the contract was proposed by Player 1 (you), and now you are deciding whether to sign, we should consider the game-theoretic effect of the contract on incentives.

But the key is: **You must decide whether to sign**, and the contract only takes effect if **both** sign.

So we are in a situation where:
- You choose to sign or not.
- The other player does the same.
- Contract only activates if **both sign**.

So we need to think: **Given that you are deciding whether to sign, and you assume the other player will act rationally, will the contract improve your payoff?**

So we'll model this as a **two-stage game**:
1. You decide to sign or not.
2. The other player observes your decision and decides to sign or not.
3. Payoffs are computed according to the contract (if active) or not.

But the problem doesn't specify that you get to observe the other player's decision — you must decide before knowing.

So you must make your decision based on **expected payoff under different outcomes**.

But we are not given a probability distribution over the other player’s choice.

So we must assume **rationality and equilibrium reasoning**.

Alternative: Analyze **whether signing the contract improves your incentives**, and whether you can **induce a better outcome**.

Let’s reframe.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Payoffs with Contract (If Both Sign)

With the contract active:

- Each player who plays A0 pays 1 point to the other player.
- A1: no cost.

So updated payoffs:

| Your Choice \ Other Choice | A0 (now pays 1 to you) | A1 (no change) |
|----------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| A0 (you pay 1, other gets 1) | (10 - 1, 10 + 1) = (9, 11) | (0 - 1, 20 + 1) = (-1, 21) |
| A1 (you pay nothing)       | (6 + 1, 2 - 1) = (7, 1)   | (4, 4)         |

Wait: Let’s clarify.

When you play A0, you pay 1 point → you lose 1.
That 1 point is **given to the other player**.

So:
- If you play A0 and other plays A0:
  - You get 10 - 1 = 9
  - Other gets 10 + 1 = 11

- If you play A0 and other plays A1:
  - You get 0 - 1 = -1
  - Other gets 20 + 1 = 21

- If you play A1 and other plays A0:
  - You get 6 (no cost to you)
  - Other pays 1 → gets 2 - 1 = 1
  - So (6, 1)

- If you play A1 and other plays A1:
  - Both pay nothing → (4, 4)

So the new payoff matrix (with contract active):

| Yours \ Other's | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------|------------|------------|
| A0                | (9, 11)    | (-1, 21)   |
| A1                | (6, 1)     | (4, 4)     |

Now analyze best responses.

#### Your Best Responses (when contract is active):

- If other plays A0:
  - You: A0 gives 9, A1 gives 6 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1:
  - You: A0 gives -1, A1 gives 4 → prefer A1

So best responses unchanged: you still respond with A0 if other plays A0, A1 if other plays A1.

So pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 9 and 11 → but check: if other plays A0, you prefer A0 → yes. If you play A0, other wants to play A0? Other gets 11 for A0, 21 for A1 → so other prefers A1 → so (A0, A0) is **not** a Nash equilibrium.

Wait: If you play A0, other gets 11 (for A0), 21 (for A1) → so other prefers A1 → so (A0, A0) not stable.

Now check (A1, A1):
- You: A1 gives 4, A0 gives -1 → prefer A1
- Other: A1 gives 4, A0 gives 1 → prefers A1
→ So (A1, A1) **is** a Nash equilibrium.

Check (A0, A1):
- You: A0 gives -1, A1 gives 4 → would deviate to A1 → not equilibrium
- Other: A1 gives 21, A0 gives 11 → prefers A1 → ok, but you don’t

Check (A1, A0):
- You: A1 gives 6, A0 gives 9 → would deviate to A0 → not equilibrium
- Other: A0 gives 11, A1 gives 1 → prefers A0 → ok, but you don’t

So **only Nash equilibrium** under contract is (A1, A1), with payoff (4,4)

Previously, without contract, **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

So the contract **eliminates (A0,A0)** as a possible equilibrium, because now if I play A0, and other plays A0, I get 9, but other gets 11 → so other would prefer to play A1 instead.

The contract makes A0 less attractive, especially when both consider doing it.

Now, what happens if both sign the contract? Then the game becomes (as above), and the only stable outcome is (A1,A1) → with payoff (4,4)

But **without the contract**, there are **two equilibria**:
- (A0, A0): gives (10,10)
- (A1, A1): gives (4,4)

So if both players want to coordinate on A0, they can — but they might fail.

With the contract, the equilibrium **forces** both to play A1 → you get 4.

But if you could coordinate on A0, you’d get 10.

So **signing the contract forces you into a worse outcome in the equilibrium**.

But wait — is that the only possibility?

The contract **may prevent coordination on A0** by making it unattractive.

But what if you use the contract to **induce better behavior**?

Let’s analyze the **other player’s incentives**.

Suppose the contract is active (i.e., both signed).

Then as above, only Nash is (A1, A1) → both get 4.

Without contract, (A0, A0) is a possible equilibrium → both get 10.

So if both players **anticipate** that they will play (A0, A0), they both prefer that.

But if the contract makes (A0, A0) unstable, they may not reach it.

So signing the contract **removes** the (A0, A0) equilibrium and leaves only (A1, A1).

But (A1, A1) gives **less payoff** to you (4 vs 10).

So **if the contract is active, you get only 4**, whereas without contract, you might get 10.

But you might also get 4 otherwise.

So signing the contract forces you to a **lower payoff**.

But let's think deeper: **Do you want to sign the contract to make the other player play A1?**

Suppose you sign, and the other player signs — you both get 4.

But if the other player **does not sign**, then the contract doesn’t apply — so you play the base game.

So you need to think about **your best strategy** given that the contract only applies if both sign.

So let’s consider the **incentive to sign**.

You only want to sign if **by signing, you can achieve a better outcome**.

Let’s suppose you **sign**, and assume the other player will sign only if it’s profitable for them.

So consider: **If the contract is active, what is the other player’s payoff?**

From the contract payoff matrix (with contract active):

- (A0, A0): (9,11)
- (A0, A1): (-1,21)
- (A1, A0): (6,1)
- (A1, A1): (4,4)

Now, what would the other player want?

The other player’s best response:
- If you play A0 → they get 11 (A0) vs 21 (A1) → prefer A1
- If you play A1 → they get 1 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A1

So no matter what you do, the other player prefers A1.

So if the contract is active, **the other player will play A1** (since A1 is dominant strategy for them).

And as we saw, your best response to A1 is A1.

So **(A1, A1)** is the only Nash equilibrium.

So if both sign, **both end up playing A1**, getting (4,4)

Now, **if you sign**, and the other player signs → you get 4.

But **if the other player does not sign**, then **contract does not apply**, so we play the base game.

Now, in the base game, if the other player does not sign, but you do — the contract is not active.

So **you are not paying anything** — the contract only applies if both sign.

So if only you sign, contract does nothing.

So your strategy is: you choose to sign or not.

Other player chooses to sign or not.

The outcome depends on both.

We must think about **what the other player will do**.

Let’s suppose you **do not sign**.

Then the contract is inactive no matter what — so you play the base game.

In the base game, equilibrium payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (10,10)
- (A1, A1): (4,4)

Now, you want (A0, A0), but it's risky — if the other player plays A1, you get 0.

But if you **sign**, and the other player **signs**, you get (4,4)

If the other player **does not sign**, and you do sign → contract inactive → base game.

So now, to decide whether to sign, consider:

- If you sign:
  - If other signs → you get 4
  - If other doesn't sign → you play base game → you might get 10 or 4 (depending on what happens)

But **you have no control over what the other player does**.

But you can **predict** what the other player will do, assuming they are rational.

So consider: **Will the other player sign?**

For the other player, signing the contract is only beneficial **if they get better payoff when the contract is active than when it's not**.

So let’s compute the other player’s expected payoff if:
- They sign (and you sign): then contract is active → they get 4 (in (A1,A1) equilibrium)
- They sign (but you don’t): then contract inactive → base game → they might get 10 or 4

But if they sign and you don’t, contract is inactive — so no payment.

So their payoff is just from base game.

So to decide whether to sign, they compare:
- Their payoff if they sign (contract active) → which is **4**, since (A1,A1) is the only equilibrium
- Their payoff if they don’t sign → depends on what you do

But if **you do not sign**, then even if they sign, the contract is inactive — so again, base game.

So the only way contract is active is if **both** sign.

So the other player can only get the benefit (or cost) of the contract if **you also sign**.

So the other player will sign **only if** the expected payoff from signing (i.e., when contract is active) is better than not signing (when contract inactive).

But since they don’t know your action, they must consider:

Let’s say they believe **you will sign** with some probability.

But to simplify, suppose they are **rational and expect you to act rationally**.

So suppose the other player thinks: “If I sign, then the contract only activates if you also sign.”

So they will only get the benefit (if any) if you sign.

But if you sign, and I sign → contract active → I get 4 (from (A1,A1))

If I don’t sign, then even if you sign, contract inactive → we play base game.

In the base game, if I don’t sign, and you sign → contract inactive → base game → then what happens?

Possibility: both might coordinate on (A0, A0) → I get 10.

Or (A1, A1) → I get 4.

The other player might prefer (A0, A0), but unless coordination is perfect, they might end up on (A1, A1).

But let’s suppose that without contract, both can coordinate on (A0, A0) → which gives (10,10)

Is that better than getting 4 from the contract?

Yes — 10 > 4.

So if the other player believes that **if the contract is not active**, they can get 10, then they **do not want to sign**, because signing only leads to 4.

So unless they believe that without contract, they will get less than 4 (e.g., if coordination fails and they end up on (A1,A1)), but in the base game, (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

So **rational players can coordinate on (A0,A0)**.

So if the other player doesn’t sign, they can still achieve (10,10) via coordination.

So their payoff **without signing** could be 10.

But **with signing** (if both sign), they get only 4.

So they have **no incentive to sign**.

Therefore, **the other player will not sign**.

Because signing forces them into a 4-payoff outcome, while not signing allows them to possibly get 10.

Therefore, **the other player will not sign, regardless of your action.**

Therefore, **the contract will never be active**, because the other player will not sign.

So your decision to sign:
- If you sign and they don’t → contract inactive → you play base game
- If you don’t sign → contract inactive → base game

So **in either case, contract is inactive**.

Thus, signing the contract **does nothing** — you get the same outcome as not signing.

But you have no downside in signing — it only costs you something if you are required to pay, but the **contract only applies if both sign**.

So if you sign but the other doesn’t, the payment mechanism is not triggered.

So **you lose nothing by signing** — but gain nothing either.

But **wait**: is there any benefit?

Suppose you sign, and the other player thinks: “If I sign, we both get 4; if I don’t sign, and you sign, then contract inactive, and perhaps we can coordinate on A0 and get 10.”

The other player knows that if they don’t sign, and you sign, then you can still play A0 and get 10 — no penalty.

But if they sign, and you sign, they get only 4.

So again, they have **no incentive to sign**.

Therefore, **the other player will not sign**.

So **no matter what you do, the contract will not be active**.

Thus, **signing the contract has no effect** on the actual outcome.

But is there any reason to sign?

Only if it provides some benefit — but it doesn’t.

So your payoff will be the same as if you didn’t sign.

But: **signing does not hurt you**, so you might be indifferent.

But the question is: **does signing maximize your expected payoff?**

The answer is: **signing gives you exactly the same expected payoff as not signing**, because the contract is never active.

But there is a **tiny risk**: could signing signal something?

For example, if you sign, the other player might think: “They want to enforce A1” — but that would only matter if they believe you are committed.

But in this game, no commitment device — you only control your action, not the contract.

And since the other player sees you sign, they know that **if they also sign**, they get 4.

But they can avoid that by not signing.

So they won’t sign.

Hence, no effect.

Therefore, **signing the contract is neutral**: same payoff, no benefit, no cost.

But should you sign?

Only if it helps improve coordination.

But in this case, the contract **hurts** coordination on A0.

It introduces a penalty for A0, which makes people avoid it.

Without contract, (A0, A0) is a stable equilibrium.

With contract, it is not.

So signing the contract **reduces the likelihood** of reaching (A0, A0), which gives you 10.

So you **do not want** to reduce the chance of getting 10.

Therefore, **you should not sign** the contract.

Even if signing has no cost, **it could induce a worse outcome** if the other player believes you are serious.

But in this case, since the other player is rational and knows that signing leads to worse payoff (4 vs 10), they will not sign.

So you can **safely avoid signing**, and the outcome is the same.

But here's a key point: **by not signing, you preserve the possibility of coordination on (A0, A0)**.

By signing, even if it doesn’t activate, it sends a signal: "I am not willing to play A0" — which could discourage the other player from playing A0.

But is that a problem?

Suppose you sign. The other player sees this.

They think: “If I play A0, and you play A0, then I get 10, but you get 10 — but if you play A0, and I play A0, you pay 1? No — only if both play A0 and contract is active.

But if you signed but I don’t, contract not active.

So you playing A0 is still safe — no cost.

So your signing doesn’t affect the base game.

So other player still sees that A0 is safe.

So unless you commit to playing A0, signing doesn’t hurt.

But in fact, **signing makes no difference**.

So you might as well not sign.

But let’s suppose you are **worried** about the other player playing A1.

But you can always respond with A1.

So you don’t need the contract.

The **only way signing helps** is if it changes the other player’s beliefs.

But since the other player is rational and sees that signing leads to a lower equilibrium payoff (4 vs 10), they will not sign.

And if they don’t sign, your signing is irrelevant.

Therefore, there is **no benefit** to signing.

And since there is **no cost**, you might be indifferent.

But the **game is about maximizing expected payoff**.

Since signing gives **no improvement**, and might signal something that could hurt coordination if misinterpreted, but in this case, it can’t, because contract is inactive.

So **optimal choice is to not sign**.

But wait — is there a way that **by signing, you can make the other player believe you will not play A0**?

For example, if you sign, and the other player thinks: “If I play A0, and you play A0, you pay 1 — but only if contract active. But if I don’t sign, contract not active — so you won’t pay.”

So no.

Therefore, the other player has no reason to change behavior.

Thus, **your expected payoff is the same regardless of whether you sign**.

But since the **only thing** the contract does is eliminate (A0, A0) as an equilibrium, and you prefer (A0, A0) to (A1, A1), you should **not sign** to preserve the possibility of the good equilibrium.

Therefore, **you should not sign**.

Final answer: **do not sign** the contract.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P1
response:
Let’s analyze this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the game structure

We are playing a 2-player simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

The payoffs are as follows (for Player 1, since you are Player 1):

| Your Action | Other Player’s Action | Your Points | Other Player’s Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 10          | 10                     |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 20                     |
| A1          | A0                     | 6           | 2                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 4           | 4                      |

This is a non-zero-sum game. Let’s now look for Nash equilibria or reasonable strategies.

---

### Step 2: Analyze strategies — best responses

Let’s suppose the other player plays A0 with probability **q**, and A1 with probability **1−q**.

Your expected payoff from choosing A0:
- E[A0] = q × 10 + (1−q) × 0 = 10q

Your expected payoff from choosing A1:
- E[A1] = q × 6 + (1−q) × 4 = 6q + 4(1−q) = 6q + 4 − 4q = 2q + 4

Now, find when A0 is better than A1:
- 10q > 2q + 4 → 8q > 4 → q > 0.5

So:
- If the other player chooses A0 with probability > 0.5, you prefer A0.
- If q < 0.5, you prefer A1.
- If q = 0.5, E[A0] = 10×0.5 = 5, E[A1] = 2×0.5 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 → indifferent.

Now, do the same from the other player’s perspective (Player 2), but remember: the roles are symmetric in payoffs? Let’s check.

Wait — the payoffs are **not symmetric**.

Player 2 (the other player):
- If they play A0:
  - If you play A0 → 10
  - If you play A1 → 2
- If they play A1:
  - If you play A0 → 20
  - If you play A1 → 4

So Player 2’s expected payoff when you play A0 with probability p, A1 with 1−p:

- E₂[A0] = p×10 + (1−p)×2 = 10p + 2 − 2p = 8p + 2
- E₂[A1] = p×20 + (1−p)×4 = 20p + 4 − 4p = 16p + 4

Set them equal: 8p + 2 = 16p + 4 → -8p = 2 → p = -0.25 → impossible.

So E₂[A1] > E₂[A0] for all p in [0,1]. Let's verify:
- At p = 0: E[A0] = 2, E[A1] = 4 → A1 better
- At p = 1: E[A0] = 10, E[A1] = 20 → A1 better
- So for all p: 16p + 4 > 8p + 2 → A1 strictly dominates A0 for Player 2.

Thus, **Player 2 will always prefer A1**, no matter what you do.

This is key.

---

### Step 3: Deduce the other player’s strategy

Since A1 strictly dominates A0 for the other player, they will **never play A0** in equilibrium. They will play A1 with probability 1.

Therefore, as Player 1, you can assume the other player will choose A1 with probability 1.

---

### Step 4: Your optimal response

Given that the other player plays A1 for sure:

- If you play A0: you get 0 points
- If you play A1: you get 4 points

So clearly, **you should choose A1**.

Thus, to maximize your expected payoff, you should play A1 with 100% probability.

---

### Step 5: Final answer

Even though we were told about a **proposed contract** that was rejected by Player 1 (which is you), and the contract is not active, we are to play **the original game without any contract modifications**.

So we ignore the contract. You are Player 1, and the other player will play A1 (since it's dominant).

Your best response is to play A1.

Hence, your strategy: A1 with 100%, A0 with 0%.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 20 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 6 points, the other player gets 2 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 10 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal strategy for **Player 1** (you) in this game, taking into account both the base payoff structure and the **contract** that alters payoffs based on action choice.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Payoffs

The base game payoffs (without contract) are:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Points | Opponent's Points |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 10          | 10                |
| A0          | A1                | 0           | 20                |
| A1          | A0                | 6           | 2                 |
| A1          | A1                | 4           | 4                 |

This is a symmetric-looking but not quite symmetric game.

---

### Step 2: Incorporate the Contract

Now, consider the **payment contract**:

- If you choose **A0**, you get an **extra +10 points**, but these 10 points are **drawn equally from the other players**.
- If you choose **A1**, you **pay -10 points**, which are **distributed equally among the other players**.

Since there are only **two players**, “equally from the other players” means:
- If you choose A0 → you gain +10, opponent loses 10.
- If you choose A1 → you lose 10, opponent gains 10.

So we **add** this contract adjustment to the base payoffs.

---

### Step 3: Compute Final Payoffs with Contract

We’ll now compute your final expected payoff in each of the four scenarios, incorporating the contract:

#### Case 1: You play A0, Opponent plays A0
- Base: You = 10, Opponent = 10
- Contract: You choose A0 → +10; Opponent chooses A0 → +10 (but wait! Let’s be careful.)

Wait — important clarification: The contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So if you play A0, you get +10 **from** the other player(s). If opponent plays A0, they also get +10 from you.

But since only two players, when **you** choose A0, you get +10 **paid by opponent** (so opponent loses 10). Similarly, if opponent chooses A0, they get +10 paid by you (so you lose 10).

Ah — so **both players gain +10 when they choose A0**, but that money comes from *the other player*. So:

- If **you choose A0**: you get +10 **from the opponent**
- If **opponent chooses A0**: they get +10 **from you**

Similarly:
- If you choose A1: you pay -10, so opponent gains +10 from you
- If opponent chooses A1: they pay -10, so you gain +10 from them

Thus, the **net effect** is:

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Base | Contract Adjustment | Your Total | Opponent's Total |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|------------|------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 10        | +10 (from opponent)  | **20**     | 10 – 10 = 0      |
| A0          | A1                | 0         | +10 (from opponent)  | **10**     | 20 + 10 = 30     |
| A1          | A0                | 6         | –10 (to opponent)    | **–4**     | 2 + 10 = 12      |
| A1          | A1                | 4         | –10 (to opponent)    | **–6**     | 4 + 10 = 14      |

Let’s clarify the contract logic again. Suppose:
- When you choose A0: you get +10, opponent gets –10
- When you choose A1: you get –10, opponent gets +10
- Same for opponent: if opponent chooses A0 → opponent gains +10, you lose 10
- If opponent chooses A1 → opponent loses 10, you gain +10

But this leads to **double-counting** unless we realize: each player gets their own contract bonus or penalty independently.

So yes — the adjustments are **independent per player**.

So total effect:

Your final payoff = base payoff + [if you chose A0: +10 else -10]  
Opponent's final payoff = base payoff + [if opponent chose A0: +10 else -10]

Wait — actually, re-reading: _"If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."_

So it's not “they get 10, the other loses 10”. It’s more like: the 10 is taken from the other players **in total**, and divided among them?

No — "drawn equally from the other players" — if only one other player, then the entire 10 is taken from the other player.

Yes, so:
- If **you** choose A0 → you get +10, and **opponent pays 10** → opponent loses 10.
- If **opponent** chooses A0 → they get +10, you lose 10.

Same for A1: choosing A1 causes you to pay 10 (which goes to others).

So **yes**, independent effects.

Therefore, final payoffs:

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Base (You) | Contract (You: +10 if A0, -10 if A1) | Your Total | Opponent's Total (Base + Contract for opponent) |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|----------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| A0          | A0              | 10         | +10                                    | **20**     | 10 – 10 = 0 (since opponent chose A0, so opponent gets +10, you get –10) → wait no: let's clarify.

Actually, let's define it clearly:

Let:
- **Your final payoff** = base payoff + (10 if you played A0, else –10)
- **Opponent's final payoff** = base payoff + (10 if opponent played A0, else –10)

But in the base payoff table, **your** payoff is given, and **opponent's** payoff is separately given.

So in the case:
- You choose A0, Opponent chooses A0:
  - Base: 10 for you, 10 for opponent
  - Contract: you get +10, opponent gets +10
  - So:
    - Your total: 10 + 10 = **20**
    - Opponent's total: 10 + 10 = **20**

Wait — but that can't make sense because money must be conserved?

Is the contract creating new money? Or redistributing?

Let’s think about total money in the system.

Without contract: total points in each outcome:
- (A0,A0): 10+10 = 20
- (A0,A1): 0+20 = 20
- (A1,A0): 6+2 = 8
- (A1,A1): 4+4 = 8

With contract:
- If you play A0: +10 to you, so –10 from opponent
- So net change in total: +10 to one, –10 to the other → total unchanged
- But if **both** play A0: you get +10, opponent gets +10 → total increases by 20? That would mean **new money is created**, which violates conservation.

That suggests our interpretation is wrong.

Wait — the contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you** choose A0 → you get 10 points from the other players.

So:
- You gain +10
- Other players lose 10 in total → distributed equally.

If only **one** other player (opponent), they lose 10.

Similarly, if you choose A1 → you pay 10 → distributed equally among others.

So if only one other player, they gain 10.

So in all cases, the total money in the system is **conserved**:
- When you play A0: +10 to you, –10 to opponent → net change: 0
- When you play A1: –10 to you, +10 to opponent → net change: 0

Now, if **both** choose A0:
- You choose A0 → you gain +10, opponent loses 10
- Opponent chooses A0 → opponent gains +10, you lose 10

So net: you gain +10 –10 = 0, opponent gains +10 –10 = 0 → total change = 0

Wait — each pays/receives from the other?

Let’s formalize:

For any player:
- If they play A0: they receive +10, paid by other players
- If they play A1: they pay –10 (i.e., give 10), shared among other players

But crucially, **the amount is fixed per player, regardless of what the other does.**

So:
- You playing A0 → you get +10 (from the other player) → opponent pays 10
- Opponent playing A0 → they get +10 (from you) → you pay 10

So in the case where both play A0:
- You get +10 (from opponent) for your A0
- Opponent gets +10 (from you) for their A0
→ So:
- You receive +10 from opponent (for your A0) AND pay +10 to opponent (for their A0)? Wait — **no**!

Wait — the contract is **per player's choice**, not conditional on the other.

So:
- When you play A0 → you get +10, and the cost is **borne by other players** (the opponent).
- When opponent plays A0 → opponent gets +10, and **you** pay 10.

So both events happen independently.

Thus, if both play A0:
- You: get +10 (A0) + pay –10 (because opponent chose A0) → net: 0
- Opponent: get +10 (A0) + pay –10 (because you chose A0) → net: 0

So:
- No change in total money from contract? Actually, money is reallocated.

Wait — let’s track money flow:
- You choose A0 → you gain +10 (paid by opponent) → opponent loses 10
- Opponent chooses A0 → opponent gains +10 (paid by you) → you lose 10

So:
- You gain +10 from your A0, but lose 10 due to opponent’s A0 → net 0
- Opponent gains +10 from their A0, but loses 10 due to your A0 → net 0

So **contract adjustments cancel out** in A0,A0.

But wait — that suggests no net movement? But each side receives and pays simultaneously.

This implies the contract is effectively **symmetric offsetting**.

Let me write it cleanly.

### Contract Effect (per player):

For **you**:
- If you choose A0: you gain +10 (paid by opponent)
- If you choose A1: you lose –10 (must pay opponent)

For **opponent**:
- If opponent chooses A0: they gain +10 (paid by you)
- If opponent chooses A1: they lose –10 (must pay you)

So the net effect on **your total** payoff:

= base payoff + (10 if you chose A0) + (–10 if opponent chose A0)

Why? Because if opponent chose A0, you must pay them 10 → you lose 10.

Similarly, if you chose A0, you gain 10.

So total for you:
> Your total = base + [10 if you chose A0] + [–10 if opponent chose A0]

Similarly, opponent’s total = base + [10 if opponent chose A0] + [–10 if you chose A0]

Wait — no:

From above:
- If you chose A0 → you gain +10, opponent loses 10 → so your payoff gets +10, opponent gets –10
- If opponent chose A0 → opponent gains +10, you lose 10 → so your payoff gets –10, opponent gets +10

So yes, the **contract adjustments** are:

Your final payoff = base payoff + 
  (10 if you chose A0) +
  (–10 if opponent chose A0)

Similarly, opponent's final payoff = base payoff + 
  (10 if opponent chose A0) +
  (–10 if you chose A0)

Wait, no: if you chose A0, opponent loses 10 → opponent's **total becomes worse** by 10.

So opponent's contract adjustment:
- If opponent chose A0 → +10
- If you chose A0 → –10 (because you're paying them?)

Wait — this is inconsistent.

Let’s re-read:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- When **player X chooses A0**, player X gets +10
- Those 10 points come from the other players (divided equally)

In a two-player game, if you choose A0 → you get +10 from opponent

If opponent chooses A0 → they get +10 from you

So:
- Your payoff has: +10 iff you chose A0
- Your payoff has: –10 iff opponent chose A0

Because if opponent chose A0, you have to pay them 10.

Similarly, opponent's payoff has:
- +10 iff opponent chose A0
- –10 iff you chose A0

So **your total payoff** = base payoff + (10 if you played A0) + (–10 if opponent played A0)

Similarly, opponent’s total = base payoff + (10 if opponent played A0) + (–10 if you played A0)

Yes, this makes sense.

Now let’s compute **your final payoff** for each combination:

#### Case 1: You A0, Opponent A0
- Base: 10
- You played A0 → +10
- Opponent played A0 → –10
- Your total = 10 + 10 – 10 = **10**

#### Case 2: You A0, Opponent A1
- Base: 0
- You played A0 → +10
- Opponent played A1 → opponent did **not** play A0 → so **no penalty** to you
- Your total = 0 + 10 + 0 = **10**

Wait! Is there a penalty only if opponent played A0?

Yes — the penalty to you (that you pay the 10) happens only if opponent played A0.

So:
- If opponent played A0 → you lose 10
- If opponent played A1 → no penalty

Similarly:
- If you played A0 → you gain 10
- If you played A1 → you pay 10

So let's correct:

#### Revised rule:
Your total payoff = base payoff +  
  (+10 if you chose A0)  
  (–10 if opponent chose A0)

Similarly, opponent’s total = base +  
  (+10 if opponent chose A0)  
  (–10 if you chose A0)

Yes.

So now compute **your final payoff** for each case:

| You | Opponent | Base | Your Contract Adjustments | Your Total |
|-----|----------|------|----------------------------|------------|
| A0  | A0       | 10   | +10 (you A0), –10 (opp A0) | 10 +10 -10 = **10** |
| A0  | A1       | 0    | +10 (you A0), –0 (opp A1) | 0 +10 = **10** |
| A1  | A0       | 6    | –10 (you A1), –10 (opp A0) | 6 –10 –10 = **–14** |
| A1  | A1       | 4    | –10 (you A1), –0 (opp A1) | 4 –10 = **–6** |

### Summary: Your Final Payoffs Under Contract

| You | Opponent | Your Final Payoff |
|-----|----------|-------------------|
| A0  | A0       | 10                |
| A0  | A1       | 10                |
| A1  | A0       | –14               |
| A1  | A1       | –6                |

Note: This is asymmetric — very bad if you choose A1 and opponent chooses A0.

Now, since you are **Player 1**, and you want to **maximize your minimum expected payoff** (as it's a zero-sum-like setting, but not exactly), but no — it's a decision under uncertainty, and you face a mixed strategy from opponent.

We need to find a **mixed strategy** (probability p of A0, 1-p of A1) for YOU that maximizes your **expected payoff**, assuming the opponent also chooses strategically to maximize their own payoff, but we don't know their strategy.

However, since we are to pick our strategy **optimally**, we assume rational opponent who will also optimize.

But since both players act simultaneously, we look for **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

But note: **you are aiming to maximize your expected payoff**, and you're told to choose a probability distribution.

So we need to find the **best response** to any strategy of the opponent, but ultimately, the best way is to find a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Alternatively, since you are maximizing your own payoff, you can compute your expected payoff as a function of your choice and the opponent's strategy.

But since you don’t know the opponent’s strategy, but we assume they are rational too, we should analyze the **equilibrium**.

But let's suppose the opponent is trying to minimize your **maximum** payoff, or just optimize their own.

Wait — you are Player 1, and you care only about **your** total points.

So let’s define your expected payoff.

Let:
- p = probability you play A0
- q = probability opponent plays A0

Then your expected payoff:

E = p*q*(10) + p*(1-q)*(10) + (1-p)*q*(-14) + (1-p)*(1-q)*(-6)

Let’s expand:

E = 10pq + 10p(1-q) –14(1-p)q –6(1-p)(1-q)

Compute term by term:

= 10pq + 10p – 10pq –14q +14pq –6(1 – p – q + pq)

Wait — better:

First:
- 10pq + 10p(1–q) = 10pq + 10p – 10pq = 10p
- Then –14(1–p)q = –14q + 14pq
- Then –6(1–p)(1–q) = –6(1 – p – q + pq) = –6 + 6p + 6q – 6pq

Now sum all:
E = [10p] + [–14q + 14pq] + [–6 + 6p + 6q – 6pq]

Combine:
- Constants: –6
- p terms: 10p + 6p = 16p
- q terms: –14q + 6q = –8q
- pq terms: 14pq – 6pq = 8pq

So:
> E = 16p – 8q + 8pq – 6

Now, since you want to maximize E, and you choose p, but q is chosen by opponent who wants to **minimize your payoff**, assuming they are rational and adversarial.

But in game theory, each player maximizes their own payoff.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose the opponent chooses q to minimize your expected payoff given your p.

So for any fixed p, adversary chooses q to minimize E(p,q) = 16p – 8q + 8pq – 6

So treat E as a function of q:

E(q) = (–8 + 8p)q + (16p – 6)

This is linear in q.

So the coefficient of q is (–8 + 8p)

- If –8 + 8p > 0 → i.e., p > 1, impossible
- If –8 + 8p < 0 → i.e., p < 1 → then increasing q *decreases* E → so opponent prefers q=1
- If –8 + 8p > 0 → p > 1 → impossible

Wait: p ∈ [0,1]

So –8 + 8p ∈ [–8, 0]

So for all p < 1, –8 + 8p < 0 → so E is decreasing in q → to minimize E, opponent chooses q = 1

At p = 1 → –8 + 8(1) = 0 → E independent of q → so opponent indifferent

So in summary:
- For any p < 1, opponent minimizes E by setting q = 1
- For p = 1, opponent is indifferent → worst case could be q = 1

So in **worst-case** for you, opponent sets q = 1 (plays A0 with probability 1)

So expected payoff if you play p:

E = 16p – 8(1) + 8p(1) – 6 = 16p – 8 + 8p – 6 = 24p – 14

Now, maximize this over p ∈ [0,1]:

E = 24p – 14 → increasing in p

So maximum at p = 1 → E = 24(1) – 14 = 10

But is this valid?

Wait — earlier we said that if p < 1, opponent sets q=1

At p=1, opponent is indifferent, so might still set q=1

So yes, worst-case outcome: opponent always plays A0 ⇒ q=1

So your expected payoff is 24p – 14

Maximized at p=1 → E=10

But what if opponent doesn't do this? What if they play q=0?

Let’s check if they would want to deviate.

But in equilibrium, we need mutual best responses.

Let’s instead compute **if opponent plays q**, what is your best response?

For fixed q, your expected payoff:

E = 16p – 8q + 8pq – 6 = p(16 + 8q) – 8q – 6

This is linear in p.

Coefficient: 16 + 8q

Since q ≥ 0, 16 + 8q > 0 → always positive

So E increases with p → best response is p = 1

**Regardless of q, your best response is to play A0 with probability 1**

Now, suppose you always play A0 → p=1

Then your expected payoff depends on opponent's q:

E = 16(1) – 8q + 8(1)q – 6 = 16 – 8q + 8q – 6 = 10

So no matter what q is, your payoff is **exactly 10**

So if you play A0 always, your payoff is 10 regardless of opponent’s action.

Now, what does opponent get?

If they expect you to play A0 always, what is their best response?

They want to **maximize their own payoff**.

Recall:
- Opponent’s total payoff = base + (10 if opponent A0) + (–10 if you A0)

But you are playing A0 always → so **you always choose A0**

So:
- Opponent’s payoff = base payoff + (10 if they play A0) + (–10)  [because you played A0]

So:

| Opponent Action | Base Payoff | Op Contract: +10 if A0 | You caused –10 | Opponent Total |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| A0              | 10          | +10                    | –10            | 10 +10 –10 = 10 |
| A1              | 20          | 0                      | –10            | 20 –10 = 10     |

So opponent gets 10 in both cases!

So opponent is indifferent between A0 and A1 → any q is rational.

Therefore, **you playing A0 always is a best response regardless of opponent** (as shown earlier), and **opponent is indifferent**, so they can play any strategy, including A0 or A1.

Therefore, **pure strategy A0 for you is a dominant strategy**!

Even though at first glance the A1 actions looked risky, with the contract, **choosing A1 always hurts you badly if opponent plays A0**, and even if they play A1, you still get –6, while if you play A0, you get at least 10.

And crucially, **no matter what opponent does, if you play A0, you get 10**.

So:
- If opponent A0: you get 10
- If opponent A1: you get 10

So **your payoff is exactly 10 no matter what**.

If you play any A1, your payoff is lower:
- If opponent A0: –14
- If opponent A1: –6

So worse in both cases.

Therefore, **playing A0 with probability 1 is strictly better than any mix or A1**.

Hence, the optimal strategy is to **always play A0**

So final answer:

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 10 points, the other player gets 10 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 20 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 2 points, the other player gets 6 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 4 points, the other player gets 4 points.
In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 1

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Identify the Payoff Matrix
Since we're playing the **original game without the contract**, I need to focus on the base payoffs. From my perspective as Player 2:

|          | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**   | I get 10     | I get 2      |
| **A1**   | I get 20     | I get 4      |

## Step 2: Check for Dominant Strategies
Let me compare my payoffs for A0 vs A1 against each of Player 1's possible actions:

**If Player 1 chooses A0:**
- My payoff from A0: 10 points
- My payoff from A1: 20 points
- A1 is better (20 > 10)

**If Player 1 chooses A1:**
- My payoff from A0: 2 points  
- My payoff from A1: 4 points
- A1 is better (4 > 2)

**Conclusion:** A1 strictly dominates A0 for me. Regardless of what Player 1 does, I'm always better off choosing A1.

## Step 3: Determine Optimal Strategy
Since A1 is a dominant strategy:
- Against any probability distribution Player 1 might choose, my expected payoff is maximized by always choosing A1
- There's no benefit to mixing strategies when I have a dominant strategy

## Step 4: Verify the Logic
Even if Player 1 tries to maximize their payoff knowing I'll play A1:
- Player 1 gets 0 points from A0 (when I play A1)
- Player 1 gets 4 points from A1 (when I play A1)
- So Player 1's best response is A1, leading to outcome (A1, A1) with both getting 4 points

This is better for me than any mixed strategy scenario.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 100}
```
