Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

response:
To maximize my total points, I want to ensure that both players choose action A0, which leads to the social optimum and the highest possible individual payoff of 5 points. In the base game, both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash Equilibria, though (A0, A0) is superior. To ensure we both pick A0, I can design a contract that makes A0 a dominant strategy for both players.

A contract specifies an additional payoff $X$ for playing $A0$ and $Y$ for playing $A1$. When player P1 chooses $a_1$ and player P2 chooses $a_2$, the additional payout for P1 is $C(a_1) - C(a_2)$ and for P2 is $C(a_2) - C(a_1)$.

To make A0 a dominant strategy, it must be the best response to both A0 and A1. Let's analyze the payoffs with the contract:
- If both play A0: (5 + X - X, 5 + X - X) = (5, 5)
- If both play A1: (3 + Y - Y, 3 + Y - Y) = (3, 3)
- If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1: (0 + X - Y, 3 + Y - X)
- If P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0: (3 + Y - X, 0 + X - Y)

For A0 to be a dominant strategy:
1.  **Response to A0:** P1 must prefer A0 over A1.
    $5 > 3 + Y - X \implies X - Y > -2$
2.  **Response to A1:** P1 must prefer A0 over A1.
    $0 + X - Y > 3 \implies X - Y > 3$

By setting $X = 4$ and $Y = 0$, both conditions are satisfied ($4 > -2$ and $4 > 3$). In this scenario, A0 becomes the dominant strategy for both players, ensuring a payoff of 5. This contract is also attractive to the other player because it guarantees the highest possible payoff of 5 for both parties as long as they act rationally.

{"A0": 4, "A1": 0}

response:
To maximize the total points received in this coordination game, we first identify the Nash equilibria and potential payoffs. The original game presents two pure-strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) with a payoff of (5, 5) and (A1, A1) with a payoff of (3, 3). The objective is to ensure that both players choose A0, as it is the Pareto dominant strategy.

Developing a contract can assist with this by making A0 a dominant strategy for both players, thereby eliminating the risk of settling on the lower-payoff equilibrium (A1, A1) or miscoordinating (where one player gets 0).

A contract {A0: x, A1: y} modifies the payoffs as follows:
- (A0, A0): 5 + x - x = 5
- (A0, A1): 0 + x - y (for Player 1), 3 + y - x (for Player 2)
- (A1, A0): 3 + y - x (for Player 1), 0 + x - y (for Player 2)
- (A1, A1): 3 + y - y = 3

To make A0 a dominant strategy for both players, the payoff for playing A0 must be higher than the payoff for playing A1, regardless of the other player's choice:
1. If the other player chooses A0: 5 > 3 + y - x $\Rightarrow$ x - y > -2
2. If the other player chooses A1: 0 + x - y > 3 $\Rightarrow$ x - y > 3

By choosing a value where $x - y > 3$, A0 becomes the strictly dominant strategy. For example, setting $x = 4$ and $y = 0$ satisfies this condition (4 > 3). This contract stabilizes the (5, 5) outcome without introducing excessive risk if a player chooses incorrectly, which makes the contract more likely to be approved and accepted by the other player. Extreme values (e.g., 100) might be rejected due to perceived risk, whereas a small integer that achieves the goal is more likely to succeed in the approval voting process.

{"A0": 4, "A1": 0}

response:
To design a contract that maximizes my total points while considering the strategic nature of the game, I need to keep in mind the payoffs and the incentives of both players.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the base game payoffs:**

   - If both players choose A0: (5, 5)
   - If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: (0, 3)
   - If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: (3, 0)
   - If both players choose A1: (3, 3)

2. **Objective:**
   Since I want to maximize my points, I want to find a contract that:
   - Encourages mutually beneficial outcomes.
   - Discourages the other player from choosing actions that significantly reduce my points.

3. **Analyzing strategies:**
   - The outcome where both choose A0 gives the highest joint payoff (5, 5).
   - The outcome where I choose A1 and the other chooses A0 gives me 3 points, which is better than 0 in the (A0, A1) scenario.
   - (A1, A1) gives both players 3 points, which is stable but not as good as (A0, A0) for joint payoff.

4. **Designing the contract:**
   - I want to incentivize the other player to choose A0 when I choose A0.
   - I want to disincentivize the other player from choosing A1 when I choose A0.
   
   To achieve this:
   - When they choose A0, I can add a positive number so they get more points when I also choose A0.
   - When they choose A1, we can add a negative number so choosing it is less attractive.
   
   Let's propose the following contract:
   - If I play A0 and the other player plays A0, both players already get a high reward, so no additional points are needed.
   - To discourage the other player from playing A1 if I play A0, I can penalize the A1 choice.
   - To keep A1 as a stable outcome, no extra points are needed.

Proposing a contract aligned to this reasoning:

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": -2}
```

Explanation:

- "A0": 0 means no additional payoff when choosing A0, keeping the high base payoff unaffected since it is already advantageous.
- "A1": -2 means a penalty for choosing A1, disincentivizing the other player from choosing it when I choose A0, promoting the A0 choice.
   - This makes A0 a more attractive strategy overall.
   
This JSON object should encourage both players to stick to the (A0, A0) outcome, which maximizes the sum total of points for both players, ensuring that I get the optimum result.

The final contract suggestion:
```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": -2}
```

response:
Let's analyze the game and design a contract that ideally aligns both players’ incentives to maximize points.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Basic Payoff Structure:**
   - If both players choose A0: Both get 5 points each.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
   - If both players choose A1: Both get 3 points each.

2. **Optimal Strategy Without Contracts:**
   - The strictly dominant strategy net result without any contract forces both players to lean toward choosing A1, which results in (3, 3). 

3. **Incentive to Shift Away From (3, 3):**
   - By looking at the basic payoff structure, the outcome where both players choose A0 yields a higher combined payoff (total 10 points) compared to both choosing A1 (total 6 points).

4. **Contract to Maximize Joint Payoff:**
   - The objective then is to form a contract that encourages both players to choose A0 over A1 consistently. 
   - To achieve this, we will add positive incentives for choosing A0 and perhaps even penalize choosing A1.

### Contract Details:

- Let's provide a small positive incentive for choosing A0, ensuring it's attractive enough that both players prefer it over A1.
- We penalize choosing A1 but remain careful not to make outcomes unfavorable for agreement.
- Player 2’s perspective but should remain fair for Player 1 on symmetrical grounds.

### Contract Design:

```json
{
  "A0": 1,
  "A1": -1
}
```

### Reasoning:

- **"A0": 1**: Incentivizes choosing A0 by adding an extra 1 point, drawn equally from the other player.
- **"A1": -1**: Disincentivizes choosing A1, with a small penalty drawn equally shared.

### Analysis of New Payoffs:
- Both choose A0:
  - Base: (5, 5)
  - Contract: (+1, +1)
  - New Total: (6, 6)
- Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Base: (3, 0)
  - Contract: (+1, -1)
  - New Total: (4, -1)
- Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Base: (0, 3)
  - Contract: (-1, +1)
  - New Total: (-1, 4)
- Both choose A1:
  - Base: (3, 3)
  - Contract: (-1, -1)
  - New Total: (2, 2)

### Conclusion:
This contract encourages the dominant strategies to realign toward mutual cooperation (A0, A0) producing optimal joint efforts, thereby maximizing total points for both if chosen rationally.

So, the final JSON object for the proposed contract would be:

```json
{"A0": 1, "A1": -1}
```

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.

response:
Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)

We are playing a symmetric game with two players (Player 1 and Player 2), and two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

This is a **coordination game** with a conflict of interest:
- Both getting 5 is best for both (mutual A0).
- Both getting 3 is decent (mutual A1).
- If one deviates, the other gains, and the deviator loses.

Note the dominant strategies:
- For Player 1:
  - If Player 2 plays A0: A0 gives 5, A1 gives 3 → prefer A0
  - If Player 2 plays A1: A0 gives 0, A1 gives 3 → prefer A1
  → No dominant strategy.
- Same for Player 2.

Pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): (5,5) — both prefer not to deviate alone.
- (A1, A1): (3,3) — if one deviates, they go from 3 to 0 (if other stays A1), so no incentive.

(A0, A1) and (A1, A0) are not equilibria.

So two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1). Both efficient in different ways.

Now, **expected payoff** depends on mixed strategies.

---

### Step 2: Goal — Maximize Your Total Points

You want to maximize your **expected total points**, including:
- Base game payoff
- Contract payments (if accepted and active)

But: **the contract is not automatically active**. It only becomes active if **both players accept** it.

Also: **You and the other player each propose a contract**. Then, **both contracts are voted on** (by you and the other player). Then, the **contract with the most approvals** wins. If tied, one is selected uniformly at random.

So: you propose **your own contract**, and the other player proposes **their own contract**.

Then:
- You vote on both contracts.
- The other player votes on both contracts.
- The one with **most approvals** is selected, and becomes active if **both accept** (but wait — let's clarify the condition).

Let’s re-read:

> Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
> The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

So: **The contract must be accepted by both players** to take effect.

But: **Only one contract ends up being used** — selected via approval voting from both players.

So how does it work?

- Both players **propose** a contract.
- Then, **each player votes** on **both contracts** (presumably).
- The contract with **more votes** wins (or tied, random).
- **Then**, for that winning contract, **both players must accept it** for it to be active.
  - If either refuses, the contract fails, and no contract is applied (i.e., only base payoffs).

Wait — does this mean that even if a contract wins the approval vote, it is still **conditional on mutual acceptance**?

Yes: "The contract becomes active only if all players accept."

So: the approval voting selects a contract from the alternatives (based on votes), but then **both must accept it** to activate it.

Thus, even if your contract wins the vote, if the other player rejects it, it doesn't activate.

So your best strategy must satisfy:
- Make a contract that the **other player is likely to accept**.
- Also, that **you are willing to accept** (obvious, but you're designing it).
- But more than that — you want this contract to **win the approval vote**.

Because:
- If your contract **wins the approval vote** and **both accept it**, you get the **contract bonus + base game payoff**.
- If it doesn’t win, or if one rejects it, no contract applies → only base game.

So: You want to **maximize the expected payoff**, considering:
- The probability that your contract wins the approval vote.
- The probability that the other player accepts it (given it wins).
- The base game outcome (which depends on your and their strategy in mixed actions).

But: this is **your proposal**, so you are not choosing what others do.

But you are designing a contract to **encourage acceptance** and **win approval**.

---

### Step 3: Strategy for Contract Design

Let’s think about what makes a contract attractive to the other player.

The contract adds to the player’s total payoff (either positive or negative).

- If you propose a **positive** amount for your action, you get a bonus when you play that action, but you pay it *from the other player*.
- The **payment is drawn equally from the other player(s)** → so if you get +X for A0, you receive X total from the other player (so their payoff is decreased by X).
- But this only happens **if the contract is active**.

So if you propose:
- {"A0": 10, "A1": 0}
Then:
- If you play A0: you get +10 (paid by the other player).
- If you play A1: you get 0 extra.

But this is **only if the contract is active**.

Similarly, if the other player plays A0, they pay you 10.

So the **total payoff** is:
- Base game payoff + contract payment

But: **only if the contract is active**.

Now, the key is: **you want the other player to accept your contract**.

Why would they accept?

They care about their **own expected payoff**.

So you want a contract that makes them **better off** (or at least not worse off), **compared to the base game and possible alternative contracts**.

But the other player will also play strategically.

---

### Step 4: Consider the Nash Equilibrium or Best Response

In the base game, what is likely to happen?

As we saw:
- (A0, A0) is efficient (5,5)
- (A1, A1) is stable (3,3), but worse for both.

But if both players are rational, they might coordinate on (A0,A0), which is **Pareto superior**.

But: if each thinks the other will play A0, then playing A1 gives 3 < 5 → so A0 is incentivized.

Similarly, if the other plays A1, A1 gives 3 > 0 → so A1 is best.

So no dominant strategy.

But the mutual A0 outcome is **risk-dominant** (if you're unsure, better to play A0).

So likely both will play A0, or some mixed strategy.

But **if one plays A0, the best response is A0** only if the other plays A0.

But with ambiguity, (A0,A0) is often the expected outcome in such coordination games.

So: **we expect (A0, A0) to be the outcome**.

But: if you can induce cooperation, or even just get a better outcome via contract, that helps.

But your goal is **maximize expected total points**.

So: can you design a contract that makes the other player **willing to accept**, and increases the chance that your contract wins the vote?

Let’s suppose you propose **a contract that gives both players a small bonus** when they coordinate on A0.

For example: give *both* a bonus if they both play A0.

But: the contract is **per-action**, not conditional.

You can only assign values to your own actions.

So: if you propose:
- A0: +5
- A1: 0

Then: whenever **you play A0**, you get +5, paid by the other player.

But the other player gets **minus 5** in that case.

So if both play A0, you get +5 (on top of base 5), total = 10, but the other player gets 5 (base) - 5 = 0.

So the other player **loses 5**.

So they **won't accept** such a contract.

You cannot give them a bonus unless you pay it from somewhere.

But **you can't give them bonus unless you take it from yourself**.

So: if you want the other player to gain, **you must lose** — but that might not help you.

But: **the contract must be accepted by both**, and you want the **other player to accept it**.

So you could make a contract where:
- When the other player plays A0, they get something (from you), but you pay it.
- And when you play A0, you get something, but you have to pay.

But if you design it so that **in the (A0,A0) outcome**, both gain, that could be good.

But how?

Suppose you give:
- {"A0": +1, "A1": -1}

Then:
- If you play A0: you get +1, paid by the other player.
- If you play A1: you pay 1 (to other player).

So if you play A0: you gain 1, other loses 1.
If you play A1: you lose 1, other gains 1.

Now, if the other player plays A0: they lose 1 if you play A0, but gain 1 if you play A1.

So **they prefer you to play A1**, which hurts you.

So if you want to coordinate on A0, this hurts the other player.

So they won't want to play A0 if you’re likely to play A0.

But that’s bad.

Alternatively, suppose you propose:
- {"A0": -1, "A1": +1}

Then:
- If you play A0: you lose 1 (pay to other).
- If you play A1: you gain 1 (get from other).

So the other player wants you to play A1.

So if they want you to play A1, that’s good — but in (A1,A1) outcome, both get 3.

But: if you play A1 and they play A1, your base payoff is 3, and you get +1 → 4 total.

Other player gets 3 - 1 = 2.

So they lose.

So they won’t accept.

So **any contract that gives you a bonus for playing A0 or A1** will cause the **other player to lose** in that case.

But the only way for the other player to gain is if **you are losing** in that case.

So to **benefit the other player, you must give up**.

But that makes it **harder for them to accept** unless they benefit in base game.

But if you make a contract that **aligns interests** — for example, one where both benefit when both play A0 — that’s ideal.

So: can you make a contract where **when both play A0**, both gain?

Yes — but only if the **net transfer is zero**.

For example, suppose you propose:
- {"A0": +3, "A1": -3}

Then:
- If you play A0: you get +3, other loses 3.
- If you play A1: you lose 3, other gains 3.

So net transfer: if both play A0: you gain 3, other loses 3 → total transfer: -3 to you.

Not symmetric.

To have symmetry, you could propose:
- {"A0": +x, "A1": -x}

But then:
- If both play A0: you get +x (total 5 + x), other gets 5 - x.
- You gain, they lose.

Unfair.

But suppose you propose:
- {"A0": 0, "A1": 0}

Then no contract effect.

That’s safe. But no benefit.

But maybe you can propose a contract that **you are willing to accept**, and **the other player is willing to accept**, and it increases cooperation.

But the other player only gains if the contract **benefits them**.

So let’s design a contract that **benefits both players in the (A0,A0) case**, and not otherwise.

But you can’t make it conditional.

Alternative idea: **induce the other player to play A0**.

Because (A0,A0) is better for you (5 vs 3).

But the other player gets 5 from (A0,A0) and 3 from (A1,A1).

So they are **indifferent** to which you do — but wait: if you do A0, they get 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1.

So they prefer **you to play A0**.

Similarly, if they play A0, you get 5 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1.

So both prefer the other to play A0.

So **mutual A0 is a focal point**.

So likely to happen.

But: suppose we want to **lock in** (A0,A0) via contract.

How?

You could propose a contract where:
- If you play A0, you get a bonus, but it’s **paid by the other player**.

But that hurts the other player — they won’t accept.

But suppose you **share the gain**.

Wait — let’s consider a contract where:
- You offer a "bonus" to the other player **if you both play A0**, but you can only do it via actions.

No.

Another idea: **use the contract to make A0 more attractive to the other player**.

But the other player chooses their action based on their expected payoff.

So if you can make their **expected payoff** higher when they play A0 than A1 (in expectation), they are more likely to play A0.

But they will balance that with your strategy.

So let’s think about **mixed strategies**.

But the game is symmetric, so a symmetric Nash equilibrium exists.

But perhaps we can use the contract to **cooperate on A0**.

Let me propose a **cooperative** contract.

Idea: you propose a contract where:
- You commit to getting paid when you play A0, but you **only do it if the other player also plays A0**.

But you can’t.

But the contract is **on actions**, not outcomes.

So: suppose you propose:
- {"A0": 5, "A1": 0}

Then:
- If you play A0: you get +5 from other player.
- If you play A1: no extra.

Now, if the other player plays A0, and you play A0: you get 5 + 5 = 10, they get 5 - 5 = 0.

So they get 0 — very bad for them.

So they won’t play A0, because if they do, and you do A0, they get 0.

But if they play A1, and you play A0, they get 3.

Better than 0.

So they prefer to play A1.

So you are **punishing** them if they play A0.

But you want them to play A0.

So this is counterproductive.

Alternatively: suppose you propose:
- {"A0": -5, "A1": 0}

Then:
- If you play A0: you pay 5 to them.
- If you play A1: you pay nothing.

So if they play A0:
- If you play A0: you lose 5, they gain 5 → you get 5-5=0, they get 5+5=10.
- If you play A1: you pay nothing, they get 0 → you get 3, they get 0.

So if they play A0, they get 10 if you play A0, or 0 if you play A1.

So they want you to play A0.

But if you play A0, they get 10 — very good.

But you get 0 if you play A0.

So you might prefer A1.

But if you play A1, you get 3, they get 0.

So if you are rational, and you think they will play A0, you get 0 if you play A0, 3 if you play A1.

So you play A1.

Then they get 0.

So they realize: if they play A0, and you play A1, they get 0.

But if they play A1, and you play A1, they get 3.

So they prefer to play A1.

So they won't play A0.

So it’s a mess.

Alternative idea: **make the contract such that the other player is better off playing A0 when you also play A0**, and vice versa.

But that’s hard.

Wait — what if you propose a contract that **gives the other player a bonus when you play A0**, and you absorb the cost?

Yes: if you propose:
- {"A0": -1, "A1": 0}

Then:
- If you play A0, you lose 1 (pay to other player).
- If you play A1, you pay 0.

So if you play A0, other player gets +1.

So other player wants you to play A0 — because if you do, they gain 1.

But you don't want to play A0, because you lose 1.

So you will want to play A1.

So you play A1, then other player gets nothing extra.

But if they play A0 and you play A1, they get 3 (base), but no extra.

If they play A1, and you play A1, they get 3.

So they are indifferent.

But to make them want to play A0, you need to make it better for them.

But if you play A0, they gain 1.

But to get that, you must play A0 — but you lose.

So you won't.

So they won't benefit.

Conclusion: if you want the other player to play A0, you need to **give them an incentive** to do so.

But the only way is to make their payoff higher for playing A0 than A1, in expectation.

So: suppose you want to **increase the other player's expected payoff from playing A0**.

But their payoff depends on your action.

So if you play A0, their payoff is 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1.

So they prefer A0.

But only if you play A0.

So if you **announce you will play A0**, they will play A0.

But you can't commit.

With a contract, you can only commit on action payouts.

But: here's a key insight:

Suppose you propose:
- {"A0": 0, "A1": 0} — no contract.

Then no issue.

But if you propose a contract where you **pay yourself when you play A0**, you harm the other player.

But what if you propose a contract that is **symmetric and zero-sum**, so that both gain from coordination?

Wait — the only way both gain from (A0,A0) is if the contract adds to both.

But you can only assign values to your own actions.

So to make the other player gain when you play A0, you must **receive less**.

But then you are making a sacrifice.

So: suppose you propose:
- {"A0": -2, "A1": 0}

Then:
- If you play A0: you pay 2 to other player.
- If you play A1: you pay 0.

Now, if the other player plays A0:
- You play A0: you get 5 - 2 = 3, they get 5 + 2 = 7
- You play A1: you get 3, they get 0

So they want you to play A0 — but you get only 3 if you play A0, or 3 if you play A1 — so you are indifferent.

So you play A1.

Then they get 0.

So they realize: if they play A0, and you play A1, they get 0.

But if they play A1, and you play A1, they get 3.

So they prefer to play A1.

So no gain.

But suppose you play a mixed strategy.

Suppose you play A0 with probability p.

Then if the other player plays A0, their expected payoff is:
- (5) if you play A0 (prob p) → they get 5 + (-2) = 3? No.

Wait: contract is paid based on your action.

So if you play A0, they get +2, regardless of their action.

So if they play A0, and you play A0: they get 5 + 2 = 7
If they play A0, and you play A1: they get 5 + 0 = 5 (since you got 0 extra)

Similarly, if they play A1, and you play A0: they get 3 + 2 = 5
If they play A1, and you play A1: they get 3

So their expected payoff:
- If they play A0: p*7 + (1-p)*5 = 7p + 5 - 5p = 2p + 5
- If they play A1: p*5 + (1-p)*3 = 5p + 3 - 3p = 2p + 3

So they prefer A0, because (2p +5) > (2p +3) for all p.

So no matter what you do, they **prefer to play A0**.

Similarly, your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: you get 5 - 2 = 3 if they play A0, 0 - 2 = -2 if they play A1
- If you play A1: you get 3 +0 = 3 if they play A0, 3 +0 = 3 if they play A1

So your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: p*3 + (1-p)*(-2) = 3p -2 +2p = 5p -2
- If you play A1: p*3 + (1-p)*3 = 3

So you play A1 if 3 > 5p -2 → 5 > 5p → p < 1

So as long as p < 1, you prefer A1.

But p is your own probability, so you can choose p.

But now, you are choosing p based on the contract.

But the other player, seeing the contract, knows that you will play A1 if p < 1.

So they know that if they play A0, they get 7 with probability p (which you play A0), but p will be low.

But more importantly, the other player will choose p to maximize their benefit.

But you are choosing your own mixed strategy.

Let’s suppose you play A0 with probability p.

The other player, seeing the contract {"A0": -2, "A1": 0}, will choose their action to maximize their expected payoff.

As above, their expected payoff for A0: 2p + 5
For A1: 2p + 3
So they will play A0 always.

So they play A0 with probability 1.

Therefore, you know they play A0.

Then your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 5 - 2 = 3 (because you get 5 base, but pay 2 in contract)
- If you play A1: 3 + 0 = 3

So you are indifferent.

So you can play any p.

So you will play A0 with some probability, say 1.

Then you get 3.

But if you play A1, you also get 3.

But you have to pay the contract only when you play A0.

But if you play A0, you pay 2 — but you get 5 from base.

So you get 3.

If you play A1, you get 3.

So no problem.

But the other player gets 5 +2 =7 if you play A0, or 5 if you play A1.

But since you play A0 with some probability, their expected payoff is 7p + 5(1-p) = 2p +5.

Since p can be 1, they could get 7.

But you only get 3.

So you are not better off.

But you want to maximize your payoff.

Without contract, you can get 5 if both play A0.

With this contract, you get only 3.

So worse.

So this is bad.

So not good.

But you want to make you and the other player both better off.

So let’s try a different idea.

Suppose you propose:
- {"A0": 0, "A1": 0} — no contract.

Then if both play A0, you get 5.

Perfect.

But maybe you can do better.

Suppose you propose a contract that **gives a bonus to both in the (A0,A0) case**, but only if you are both willing.

But you can't.

 unless you make the contract such that when both play A0, the net effect is zero for both.

For example, suppose you propose:
- {"A0": -5, "A1": 5}

Then:
- If you play A0: you pay 5 to other player.
- If you play A1: you receive 5 from other player.

So if you play A0, other gets 5.
If you play A1, other loses 5.

So other player will play A0 if you play A0, because they gain 5.

But you lose 5 if you play A0.

So you don't want to play A0.

But if you play A1, other player loses 5.

So they won't want you to play A1.

So they play A0.

But you won't play A0.

So you play A1.

Then other player gets -5 if you play A1 (since you get 5, they pay 5).

So they get 3 - 5 = -2 if they play A0, or 3 if they play A1.

So they prefer to play A1.

So both play A1.

Then you get 3 + 5 = 8? Wait.

If you play A1, you get 5 from contract (so you receive 5 from other), and base 3.

But if you play A1, and they play A1, you get 3 + 5 = 8.

Other player gets 3 - 5 = -2.

So they get -2.

So they might not accept the contract.

So not good.

But the key idea is: ** you can use the contract to coordinate on a better outcome by aligning incentives.**

But the only better outcome for you is (A0, A0) with 5.

So you want to increase the chance that (A0, A0) happens.

How?

Make it in the other player's interest to play A0, even if it's not already.

But in the base game, it already is, because if you play A0, they prefer to play A0.

So to make it even better, give them a bonus if they play A0, but you pay it.

But then you suffer.

So only if you can get them to play A0 even when you might not.

But if you are going to play A0 anyway, why not just play it?

But the contract might change their beliefs.

Wait — here's the winning idea:

**Propose a contract that makes you better off when you play A0, and the other player better off when they play A0, in expectation, and you expect to cooperate on A0.**

But how?

Only if the contract is zero-sum.

But then either you gain or they gain.

 unless you both gain from the coordination.

But the only way is to have a net zero transfer.

So propose a contract where:
- The sum of your contract payments is 0 in the (A0,A0) case.

For example:
- Suppose you propose: {"A0": 0, "A1": 0} — net zero.

But no change.

Or: {"A0": 2, "A1": -2} — then if both play A0, you gain 2, other loses 2.

Not good for them.

So no.

But if you could make a contract where if both play A0, you both get +1, but you have to pay from somewhere.

You can't.

So impossible to both gain from the contract in (A0,A0) unless the net transfer is zero.

But then no benefit.

So the only way to improve is to make the other player willing to play A0 even if you might not, by giving them an incentive.

For example, if you propose: {"A0": 2, "A1": -2}

Then if you play A0, you get +2, other gets -2.

If you play A1, you get -2, other gets +2.

So if the other player plays A0, they want you to play A0 (because you do A0, they lose 2, you gain 2).

So they don't want you to play A0.

So they want you to play A1.

So they play A1.

Then you play A1.

Then you get -2, they get +2.

But you get 3 -2 = 1, they get 3 +2 = 5.

So you get only 1.

Worse.

So not good.

After much thought, here's a better idea: ** propose a contract that is attractive to the other player, even if it costs you, because it might get you the (A0,A0) outcome.**

But (A0,A0) is already the natural thing.

But perhaps if you propose a contract that makes you lose money when you play A1, and gain when you play A0, but only if the other player is playing A0.

But you can't.

Final idea: ** the safest and best is to propose a contract that has no cost and no benefit, so both will accept it easily, and it won't change anything.**

Then you get the base game.

But you might do better.

Wait — what if you propose a contract that gives you a bonus for A1, but it's very small.

But you want to coordinate on A0.

Or what if you propose: {"A0": 0, "A1": 0}

That's simple.

And both players will likely accept it, because it doesn't hurt them.

And it's very likely to win the vote, because it's neutral.

Then the contract is active, but no change.

Then you and the other player will likely play A0, and you get 5.

But if you can do better with a contract, why not?

Suppose you propose a contract that gives you a bonus for A0, but only if the other player also plays A0.

But you can't.

After careful analysis, the only way to make the other player accept your contract is if it doesn't harm them, or makes them better off.

But to make them better off, you must suffer.

So propose a contract that gives the other player a small bonus when you play A0, and you are willing to lose a small amount.

For example:
 - {"A0": -1, "A1": 0}

Then: if you play A0, you lose 1, other player gains 1.

So if you play A0, you get 4, other player gets 6.

So other player is better off.

But you are worse off.

But the other player will then have an incentive to play A0, because if you play A0, they get 6 > 3.

And if you play A1, they get 3.

So they want you to play A0.

But you, facing that, know that if you play A0, you get 4, if you play A1, you get 3.

So you prefer A0.

So you will play A0.

Then they play A0.

So both play A0.

You get 4 (5 -1), they get 6.

So you get 4, they get 6.

But without contract, you get 5.

So you are worse off.

So not good for you.

Suppose you propose: {"A0": -0, "A1": 0} = {"A0": 0, "A1": 0}

Then you get 5.

Better.

So you should not propose a contract that lowers your expected payoff.

Therefore, the best is to propose a contract that doesn't harm you, and doesn't harm the other player, so they accept it, and you get the base game with (A0,A0).

So the optimal is to propose a neutral contract.

Moreover, since it's neutral, it will be approved by both players, as they see no risk.

So it will win the vote (likely).

Then it's activated.

So you get 5.

 any other contract might harm you.

Therefore, the best contract to propose is the zero contract.

Thus:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
There will be the option for a payment contract in this game, and your task now is to design and propose one.

- A contract is an additional payoff agreement on top of the original game payoffs. It specifies a number for each action that a player can play, indicating one of three cases:
    * Positive number (+): the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s).
    * Negative number (-): the player pays an additional payment of X points in total, distributed equally among the other player(s).
    * Zero (0): no additional payments in either direction.
- Each player may choose to accept the contract as a whole or not.
- The contract becomes active only if all players accept.

The other player(s) will also design and propose a contract. Only one will be present in the game though. Which one will be decided in a separate step later via an approval voting process by you and the other player(s). The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### 1. Understanding the Base Game
The payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 - **Cooperative outcome**
- (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0  
- (A1, A1): Both get 3

### 2. Identifying the Problem
This is a coordination game. The Nash equilibrium involves mixed strategies with expected payoff of 3 each, but the cooperative outcome (A0, A0) gives both players 5 - much better! The challenge is ensuring both players choose A0.

### 3. Contract Design Goal
I want to design a contract that:
- Makes A0 the dominant or clearly preferred strategy
- Benefits both players (so it gets approved)
- Achieves the (A0, A0) outcome

### 4. Testing a Penalty Approach
Consider penalizing A1 to discourage defection:

**Contract: {"A0": 0, "A1": -3}**

If both players propose similar contracts (symmetric game), resulting payoffs would be:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) - unchanged, still optimal
- (A0, A1): (0, 0) - I play A0 (no penalty), opponent plays A1 (pays 3)
- (A1, A0): (0, 0) - I play A1 (pay 3), opponent plays A0 (no penalty)
- (A1, A1): (0, 0) - both pay 3 penalty

### 5. Verification
With this contract:
- Playing A0 gives me: 5 vs opponent's A0, or 0 vs opponent's A1
- Playing A1 gives me: 0 vs opponent's A0, or 0 vs opponent's A1

A0 weakly dominates A1 for both players! This ensures convergence to (A0, A0).

### 6. Approval Likelihood
The opponent should approve because:
- Leads to payoff of 5 instead of Nash equilibrium of 3
- Fair and symmetric (they likely propose the same)
- No one is disadvantaged

**Final Answer:**

{"A0": 0, "A1": -3}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 5, they get 5 ✓ Best mutual outcome
- (A0, A1): I get 0, they get 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, they get 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, they get 3

## Step 2: Identify the strategic problem

Nash equilibrium analysis:
- **(A0, A0)** is a Nash equilibrium: Both players get 5 (best outcome)
- **(A1, A1)** is also a Nash equilibrium: Both players get 3 (worse outcome)

The problem is coordination risk - we might fail to coordinate on the better equilibrium (A0, A0).

## Step 3: Design contract objectives

I want a contract that:
1. Strengthens the (A0, A0) equilibrium 
2. Discourages the (A1, A1) equilibrium
3. Is acceptable to both players (to win approval voting)

## Step 4: Evaluate contract options

**Option: Penalize A1 with {"A0": 0, "A1": -1}**

Modified payoffs:
- Me at (A0, A0): 5 (unchanged)
- Me at (A1, A1): 3 - 1 = 2
- Them at (A0, A0): 5 (unchanged)  
- Them at (A1, A1): 3 + 1 = 4

This:
- Keeps (A0, A0) optimal for me (5 > 2)
- Makes it riskier for me to play A1
- Doesn't hurt either player at the best outcome
- Gives Player 1 upside if coordination fails
- Should be acceptable to both players

## Step 5: Final decision

A modest penalty on A1 reduces coordination risk without being too aggressive, making it likely to gain approval.

{"A0": 0, "A1": -1}

response:
Let’s break this down step by step to design an optimal contract as **Player 2** in this game.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game Payoffs**

We are in a simultaneous two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from **Player 2**'s perspective):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | 5        | 0        |
| **A1**              | 3        | 3        |

So:
- If both play A0 → (5, 5)
- You play A0, Player 1 plays A1 → (0, 3)
- You play A1, Player 1 plays A0 → (3, 0)
- Both play A1 → (3, 3)

This is a **coordination game with a dominant strategy for Player 1**.

Wait — let's find Nash equilibria.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Nash Equilibria of the Base Game**

Let’s think about best responses.

#### Player 1's perspective:
- If Player 2 plays A0: Player 1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1: Player 1 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So Player 1 has **no dominant strategy**, but best response is:
- A0 if Player 2 plays A0
- A1 if Player 2 plays A1

#### Player 2's perspective:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So Player 2 also responds based on Player 1's action.

Thus, **two pure Nash equilibria**:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

And **(A0, A1)** and **(A1, A0)** are not equilibria.

So the game has two equilibria: mutual cooperation (A0), or mutual defection (A1). But the **A0-A0 outcome is strictly better for both**.

This sets up a **coordination motive**: players benefit from aligning, but they must coordinate on A0 rather than A1.

However, **Pearl's Principle**: In the absence of communication, there’s a risk of miscoordination.

But we now have a **contracting mechanism**, which can help coordinate.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contracting Mechanism**

- You propose a contract: a pair of numbers, one for A0 and one for A1.
- Each number is the **extra payoff** you get (positive) or pay (negative) if you play that action.
- The **other player also proposes a contract**.
- **Only one contract is selected**, via **approval voting**: the one with the **most approvals**.
- If multiple have same max approvals, one is **chosen uniformly at random**.
- The selected contract is applied **only if all players accept it**.

> Your goal: **maximize your expected total points**, including base game payoffs and any contract payoff.

You are **Player 2**, so you are the one designing the contract to influence the outcome.

---

### **Step 4: Strategy for Contract Design**

We want to **increase the likelihood of mutual A0**, which gives both players **5** — the best joint outcome.

But we must make the contract **acceptable (approved) by both players**.

- You control your proposal.
- The other player also proposes one.
- The **winning contract** depends on **approval by both players**, and the number of approvals.

So your proposal must:
1. **Incentivize both players to play A0** (or at least not to deviate).
2. **Be acceptable (not too costly) for the other player**, so that they **approve** it.
3. **Be seen as beneficial or neutral** to the other player, otherwise they won’t approve.

But here’s the key twist: **the contract only activates if both approve it**.

So if you propose a contract that **hurts the other player**, they **won’t approve it**, and it won’t activate.

So your best bet: **design a contract that makes both players prefer to coordinate on A0**, and where **you are willing to pay a little to get cooperation**, but **the other player sees net benefit**.

Let’s think: **can we make A0 dominate?**

Suppose we **add a bonus for A0**.

But if you do **only** that, then:
- If the other player plays A0, you earn more by playing A0 → good.
- But if you add **only a bonus for A0**, say +2 to A0, then:
  - If the other player plays A0, you prefer A0 (5 + 2 = 7 vs 3)
  - But if the other player plays A1, you prefer A1 anyway (3 vs 0) — so not helpful for coordination.

But if you can **convince the other player to play A0**, and **isolate the premium to A0**, you can shift the equilibrium.

Wait — but you are **Player 2**, so the other player is **Player 1**.

Let’s suppose you propose:
- A0: +5
- A1: 0

Then if **Player 1** plays A0, you get 5 (base) + 5 (contract) = 10 → want to play A0
If **Player 1** plays A1, you get 0 + 5 = 5 in contract, but base is 0 → so your worst case is playing A0 when they play A1 — you get 5 (contract), but only 0 base → total 5, or play A1 → 3 base + 0 contract → 3 → so you’d still prefer A0 → **you always prefer A0**.

Wait — that’s powerful.

But what if you do **A0: +5, A1: 0**?

Then:
- Your total payoff if you play A0: base + 5 if Player 1 plays A0 → 5+5=10; if Player 1 plays A1 → 0+5=5
- If you play A1: base + 0 → 3 in either case

So **no matter what Player 1 does, you prefer to play A0** (5 > 3, 10 > 3). So you'll always play A0.

Now, does **Player 1** want to approve this contract?

Player 1 gets **aligned payoff** only in case of A0, but they **pay nothing** in the contract — they only get either 5 or 3 base. But in this contract, **Player 1 receives no extra payoff** — so their **expected payoff depends only on base game**.

But Player 1 has **no incentive to play A0 unless they believe you will too**.

Let’s simulate.

Suppose Player 1 considers **approving this contract**.

They know:
- If they play A0, and you play A0 → 5
- If they play A0, and you play A1 → 0 (but you won’t play A1 — because you’re locked into A0!)
- Because you **always play A0** (due to the contract), then if they play A0 → they get 5
- If they play A1 → they get 3

So they prefer A0 → 5 > 3

So **Player 1 wants to play A0**, and since they get **no cost** from the contract, they will want to accept it — **only downside: they might get hurt if you played A1**, but here you **won’t**, because the contract makes you strictly prefer A0.

So **Player 1 will approve this contract**.

And **you** (Player 2) will approve it — obvious.

So both approve → luxury.

But **can you do better**?

Insight: you can **pay yourself a bonus for A0**, and **charge Player 1 a cost for A1**, but that might make Player 1 reject.

Alternatively, **you can make A0 more attractive for both**.

But here’s a better idea:

### Proposal: Make A0 more attractive for both players, with **a small net cost to you**, but **gain in coordination**

Let’s suppose you propose:

- A0: +3 (you gain 3 if you play A0)
- A1: -1 (you pay 1 if you play A1)

This makes A0 +3, A1 -1 → your net preference for A0 increases.

But does **Player 1** want to approve this?

- If Player 1 plays A0, gets 5 base, plus **they receive nothing** from your contract (you specify only your own payouts).
- Important: **the contract specifies** ONLY **your** payoffs.
- The other player gets **no extra**, **even if you specify a number for A0**.

So **Player 1 does not get any benefit** from your A0 bonus.

Therefore, Player 1 sees:
- If you play A0 (which you might), they get 5 (A0) or 3 (A1) base.
- Your contract **does not add anything to them**, so their incentive is the same.

But in this contract, **you sign a cost for A1**, which **you pay to them**.

Wait — **contract is drawn from the other player(s)**.

> "the player receives an additional payment of X points in total, drawn equally from the other player(s)."

So: **if you set a negative number for A1**, say -5, then:
- When you play A1, you **pay** 5.
- But **this 5 is distributed equally among the other player(s)** → so Player 1 gets 5.

**So if you play A1, you pay 5, and Player 1 receives 5.**

Similarly, if you set A0: +5, then if you play A0, you get 5, and **it is taken from Player 1**.

So **your contract affects both players’ payoffs**, via a redistribution.

Ah! This is **critical**.

So:
- Your contract: (A0: +5, A1: -1) means:
  - If you play A0 → you gain 5 → this is **taken from Player 1**
  - If you play A1 → you lose 1 → this is **paid to Player 1**

So:
- **Player 1 benefits** from your moving to A1 (lose you 1), but **hurts** from your A0 (you get 5 from them)

So your contract acts like **side payments** that depend on your action.

So Player 1 **will dislike you playing A0**, and **like you playing A1**.

So if you set A0: +5, A1: -1 → Player 1 **prefers you to play A1**, which **conflicts with coordination on A0**.

That's bad.

So any **positive number for A0** makes Player 1 lose money if you play A0 → they **discourage A0**.

Similarly, any **negative number for A1** means you pay them if you play A1 → they **want you to avoid A1** → that’s good for coordination.

But if you want to **encourage A0**, you could **charge a penalty for A1** — but that’s **bad for Player 1**, since they get paid when you play A1.

So you can’t directly make A0 attractive to **them** via your contract — because you **can’t give them money when you play A0** — you **take money from them** when you play A0.

**Therefore, you cannot give Player 1 a positive incentive to support A0** via your own contract.

The only way to give **Player 1 incentive to support A0** is to **make A0 good for them** — but you can’t do that unless you **give them money when you play A0** — but that would require you to **set A0: negative**, which **hurts you**.

So you **cannot numerically reward Player 1 for A0** — it would require **you to pay them** in that case, which is costly to you.

So is **forcing coordination** possible?

Alternative idea:

### Propose a contract that **makes A1 unattractive for you**, but **doesn’t hurt Player 1**.

But remember: if you set A1: -5, you pay 5 if you play A1, and Player 1 gets 5.

So Player 1 **loves** you playing A1.

So if you set a large negative for A1, you discourage yourself from playing A1 → **good for coordination**, but you are giving Player 1 **an incentive to want you to play A1**.

That’s the opposite of what you want.

So again, **bad news**.

---

### Key Insight:

You cannot **create a direct incentive** for Player 1 to cooperate, because any reward for A0 (positive for you) **hurts Player 1**, and any penalty for A1 (negative for you) **helps Player 1**.

So you **cannot** make Player 1 **want** the A0-A0 outcome via your contract alone.

But here’s the **counterintuitive possibility**:

Maybe instead of trying to **incentivize Player 1**, you just **leave everything neutral**, and let **the game already coordinate**?

But without coordination, they might play A1-A1 → you get 3.

But if you **propose no contract** → contract (0,0), which gives no extra payments.

Then both players see only base game.

Base game has two equilibria: A0-A0 (5,5), A1-A1 (3,3)

So both players should **strive for A0-A0**.

But in the absence of communication, there’s a **risk** of miscoordination.

But with the contract, you can **force** yourself to play A0?

Wait — can you affect your **own incentive**?

Yes!

If you **set A0: +10**, A1: 0 → then:
- If you play A0: you gain 10
- If you play A1: 0

But this 10 is **taken from Player 1**, so they **lose 10** if you play A0.

So Player 1 **really hates** it if you play A0.

So they will **avoid A0 → play A1**, so they don’t get hurt.

Then you play A0 → get 10 (contract) + 0 (base) = 10

But Player 1 plays A1 → you get 0 base → total 10

Player 1 gets 3 base + 10 (you got from them) = 13 → but they were forced to play A1 because you play A0.

But why would you do this? You are paying 0 for A1, but if you play A1, you get no contract → but base 3.

But you are **not** threatened by the contract — it’s **your choice to play A0 or A1**.

But you will always play A0 — because +10 > 0.

But the problem is: **Player 1 knows** that if you play A0, they lose 10.

So **they avoid playing A0** — they play A1.

So outcome: you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0 base + 10 contract = 10

They get 3 base + 10 contract = 13

But **you get 10**, which is **better than 5** from A0-A0 — is it?

Wait — and your **own contract** is hurting you if they play A1 — in this case, you can’t help it.

But **you get 10** — but **are you happy with that**?

But the catch: **if they play A0**, you get 5 + 10 = 15 — even better!

But they **won’t play A0** — because they lose 10.

So the equilibrium is **you play A0, they play A1** — you get 10, they get 13.

But **you could get 5** in the base game with A0-A0 — but you’re not getting that.

But with your contract, you **get 10**, which is better.

But is this **better than 5**? Yes — but **only if they play A1**.

But you can’t force them to play A0.

But they won’t — they are rational.

So the outcome becomes (A0, A1) → you get 10, they get 13.

But **you can get the same 10** by just playing A0 *without* a contract — but then you get 0 base, but if they play A1, you get 0.

But with the contract, you **get 10** when they play A1, because of the extra.

So **this contract gives you a guaranteed positive**, regardless.

But **your goal is to maximize expected points**, so you want **high total payoff**.

But what is the **optimal strategy**?

Let’s consider: can we design a contract where:
- You always play A0 (due to contract)
- But Player 1 **also plays A0**, so you get 5 base + contract benefit

But Player 1 only plays A0 if they **prefer it**.

How can you make them prefer A0?

Only if **your contract doesn’t hurt them**.

So the **only safe way** is to **not give them any cost**.

So the only way for Player 1 to **accept the contract** is if it’s **not harmful to them**.

If you set all values to **0**, then contract is neutral, they get to play the base game.

They might coordinate on A0-A0.

If you set **A0: +2**, A1: 0 → you get +2 if you play A0, but **Player 1 loses 2**.

So they see: if you play A0, they lose 2.

So they will **avoid A0** → prefer A1.

So they may not accept this contract.

But if you set A0: 0, A1: 0 → then neither player is affected by the contract.

Then they play the base game.

They might coordinate on A0.

But without communication, there’s risk.

But if both of you propose **(0,0)**, it will be approved — and maybe you both play A0.

But is there a way to **guarantee** better?

Wait — **you can design a contract that makes you prefer A0, but doesn’t affect Player 1** — but you can’t, because **any positive payment to you must come from them**, so it **hurts them**.

So the **only way** to make a contract that Player 1 **won’t reject** is to **not change the payoff to them in a negative way**.

So **negative values for you (paying) mean Player 1 receives money**, which **helps them** — so **they like** that.

Positive values for you (earning) mean **they lose**, so **they dislike**.

So to **make the contract attractive to Player 1**, you should set **positive numbers for you**, but that hurts them.

So the **only safe contract** that Player 1 will always approve is one where **they do not lose money**.

So you should **not set any positive value for A0**, because that would cost them when you play A0.

But if you set **negative values (you pay)**, they **gain**, so they **like it**.

So the **only contracts that Player 1 will accept** are those where **you pay something** (negative values) or **no change**.

But if you set, say, A1: -1 (you pay 1 if you play A1), then:
- Player 1 gains 1 if you play A1 → so you have **less incentive to play A1**.
- But they are **happy** to have you play A1 (because they get 1), so they might play A0 or A1 to get that.

But this is **bad** for coordination — you now want to play A0, they want to play A1.

But coordination is harder.

So the **only truly safe and beneficial contract** is **(0,0)** — **no changes**.

Then:
- Player 1 sees no cost → approves.
- You see no cost → approves.
- Contract activates → base game played.
- You both can coordinate on A0-A0.

This gives you 5.

Alternatively, if you try to **take money in A0**, you hurt Player 1 and they won't approve.

So you cannot propose anything **positive**.

But if you propose **(0,0)**, contract is approved.

Now, what if you propose **(0, -5)**?

Then:
- If you play A1, you pay 5 → they get 5.
- They **like** you playing A1.
- But if they play A0, you get 0 + 0 = 0 if they play A1 → base 0, contract 0 → 0.
- But if you play A0, you get 0 base + 0 contract = 0, but Player 1 gets 0.
- But you don’t care — you will play A0 anyway, since A0 gives 0, A1 gives -5.

So you play A0.

Then Player 1: if they play A0 → they get 5 base + 0 = 5, but you play A0, so they get 5.

If they play A1 → they get 3 base + 0 = 3.

So they prefer A0.

So outcome: A0-A0 → you get 0 (contract) + 5 (base) = 5
Player 1 gets 5.

So **same as base game**.

But you didn't gain anything.

But you could do better?

Wait.

Suppose you propose **( -3, 0 )** — you pay 3 if you play A0.

That means: if you play A0, you lose 3 (paid to Player 1).

So:
- You get 5 - 3 = 2 if A1 plays A0
- But if you play A1, you get 3 (base) + 0 = 3

So you prefer A1 (3 > 2)

But then if you play A1, they get 3 base + 3 = 6

But if they play A0, you get 2, they get 5.

If they play A1, you get 3, they get 6.

But you play A1, so they play A1 → you get 3, they get 6

But you could have gotten 5 if you played A0 and coordinated.

So you regret.

So you should not set negative for A0.

Only possible safe contract is **(0,0)**.

But wait — what if you propose **(0, -1)**?

Then:
- You play A0: no cost, get 5 base
- You play A1: pay 1, get 3 base → 2
- So you prefer A0 (5 > 2)
- So you play A0

Player 1: if they play A0 → 5 base
If they play A1 → 3 base
So they prefer A0.

So outcome: A0-A0 → you get 5, they get 5

Contract is (0,-1): you play A0 → 0 extra, so final: 5

Is this better than (0,0)? No.

But they **gain nothing** — but it's not harmful.

But now, **player 1 might still approve it**, because you don't hurt them — the contract only penalizes you for A1.

So it's fine.

But does it change the outcome? No.

So why do it?

You are not gaining.

But perhaps you can use a contract to **make the other player more likely to play A0**.

But they can't be incentivized by you.

Unless...

### Breakthrough idea: **if you make yourself prefer A0, and Player 1 knows that, they might coordinate out of a sense of fairness or best response.**

But in pure rationality, if you play A0 always, and they play A0, they get 5 — if they play A1, they get 3 — so they play A0.

So to ensure that, you can **make it obvious that you will play A0**, by setting a **large bonus for A0**.

But if you set A0: +5, then Player 1 loses 5 if you play A0.

So they will **avoid A0**.

But what if you **set a large penalty for A1**, but small?

No — penalty for A1 means they gain when you play A1.

So they will play A1.

So not good.

### Final Insight: The only contract that makes both players **not worse off** and **can be approved** is one with **no positive values for you**, because that would cost Player 1.

But if you set **A0: 0, A1: 0**, it’s neutral.

Player 1 will approve.

You approve.

Game played as base game.

You can coordinate on A0-A0.

You get 5.

But if you propose **(0,0)**, and the other game has a contract that changes things, but you control only your proposal.

But the other player might propose something like (0,0) or (5,0).

But only the one with most approvals wins.

So if you propose (0,0), and they propose (5,0), then:
- You approve (0,0)? Yes, neutral.
- They approve (5,0)? Only if it’s good for them.
- But (5,0): if you play A0, they get 5 from you.
- But if you play A0, they get 5 base + 5 = 10, but you lose 5.
- But you would play A0 only if it’s better, but you get 0 base + negative 5 = -5, or 3 from A1 → so you prefer A1.

But they want you to play A0 to get the money.

But you won't.

So they might not approve their own contract.

So likely, only (0,0) gets approved.

But to maximize your chance of getting 5, you should propose a contract that makes **you play A0**, and doesn't hurt Player 1, so that they will cooperate.

But you can’t make you play A0 without hurting them.

Wait — what if you propose a contract where you get a large reward for A0, but also a **fixed cost**, but that doesn't work.

### Best approach:

The only contract that is **guaranteed to be approved** by both players is **(0,0)**, because:
- You get no change → you approve.
- Player 1 gets no cost → they approve.
- No redistribution.

All other contracts either:
- Hurt Player 1 (positive values for you) → they won't approve.
- Or benefit Player 1 (negative values for you) → they will approve, but it may lead to miscoordination.

For example, if you set A1: -1, you pay 1 if you play A1, so they want you to play A1.
But then if you play A0, they get 5 base.
So you prefer A0 if you get 5 vs 3+(- one) = 2.

But you can play A0.
Then they get 5.

No problem.

But you don't benefit.

So the only way to get a higher payoff is to **coordinate on A0-A0**.

And the only way to ensure that is to **make it clear you will play A0**.

But you cannot do it without hurting Player 1.

### So the best contract is: **nothing changes**.

But wait — what if you propose: **A0: 0, A1: 0**?

Then you get 5 in A0-A0.

But is there a way to improve?

What if you propose: **A0: 0, A1: -100**?

Then:
- You play A0: get 5 + 0 = 5
- You play A1: get 3 - 100 = -97
- So you play A0

Player 1: if they play A0, get 5
If they play A1, get 3
So they prefer A0

So outcome: A0-A0

You get 5, they get 5

You get no extra from contract.

But contract is approved? 
- You: yes
- Player 1: they get no cost (you only pay if you play A1), so they are fine.

So they approve.

And it's safe.

But you get no gain.

But is there a contract where you get more than 5?

Only if you can get more than 5 from A0 without hurting Player 1.

But you can't.

But what if the contract is not just about redistribution, but about commitment.

Wait.

### Final idea: **Propose a contract where you are paid for A0, but only if Player 1 also plays A0**.

But you cannot — the contract is not conditional.

It's per action, not joint.

So you can't.

Therefore, the only way to guarantee a good outcome is to make it clear you play A0.

But you can't without hurting them.

But you can **sometimes** get away with a small incentive.

Suppose you propose: **A0: +1, A1: -1**

Then:
- If you play A0: you get +1 (taken from Player 1)
- If you play A1: you pay 1 (to Player 1)

So to you: A0 gives 5+1=6, A1 gives 3-1=2 → you prefer A0

To Player 1: if you play A0, they lose 1, so they hate it.
If you play A1, they gain 1.

So they want you to play A1.

So they will play A1.

Then you play A0 → you get 0 +1 =1, they get 3 +1 =4

You get only 1.

Worse than 5.

So not good.

### Conclusion:

The only contract that **does not harm the other player**, **does not encourage miscoordination**, and allows coordination on A0-A0 is **(0,0)**.

And it is **guaranteed to be approved** by both players.

Any other contract either:
- Hurts the other player (positive for you) — they won't approve.
- Or might mislead (negative for you) — could make them play A1.

So the safe and optimal choice is to propose **neutral contract**: **(0,0)**.

Then you can converge on A0-A0, get 5.

Any other contract poses a risk of rejection or miscoordination.

Therefore, the optimal contract is:

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 0}
```

response:
To evaluate the contracts, we need to determine how each contract affects the payoff structure of the game. Given that our objective is to maximize our total points, we'll analyze the scenarios with and without each contract.

### Original Payoff Matrix without Contracts

For reference, let's first outline the original payoffs for clarity:

- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

### Contract 1 Analysis (proposed by Player 1)

Contract 1 modifications:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Let's modify the payoffs with Contract 1:

- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get: 5 + 4 - 2 = 7 points (since both players playing A0 means a net +2 for each)
  - Other player gets: 5 + 4 - 2 = 7 points

- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get: 0 + 4 - 0 = 4 points
  - Other player gets: 3 - 2 + 0 = 1 point

- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get: 3 - 2 + 0 = 1 point
  - Other player gets: 0 + 4 - 0 = 4 points

- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get: 3 points
  - Other player gets: 3 points

### Contract 2 Analysis (proposed by Player 2)

Contract 2 modifications:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Let's modify the payoffs with Contract 2:

- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get: 5 + 1 - 0.5 = 5.5 points
  - Other player gets: 5 + 1 - 0.5 = 5.5 points

- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get: 0 + 1 - 0 = 1 point
  - Other player gets: 3 - 0.5 + 0.5 = 3 points

- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get: 3 - 0.5 + 0.5 = 3 points
  - Other player gets: 0 + 1 - 0 = 1 point

- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1:
  - You get: 3 - 1 + 0.5 = 2.5 points
  - Other player gets: 3 - 1 + 0.5 = 2.5 points

### Approval Decision

Let's compare the changed payoffs. Our goal is to maximize our points.

#### Contract 1 (C1):
- Under scenarios (A0, A0) and (A0, A1), Player 2 ends up with more points.
- In scenario (A1, A0), Player 2 suffers significantly.
- In scenario (A1, A1), Player 2's points remain unaffected.

#### Contract 2 (C2):
- Generally, this contract seems to provide a balanced boost to both players when choosing A0, and penalizes both players slightly for selecting A1.
- The overall gain for Player 2 is more evenly distributed.

Given these observations, it makes sense to approve both contracts because they both provide alternative strategies to potentially maximize points. However, Contract 2 seems slightly more favorable because it distributes risks and rewards more evenly overall.

### Output JSON

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": true
}
```

This decision is based on the evaluation that both contracts can offer strategic advantages and flexibility in maximizing points, given that they change the payoff structures in ways that can be exploited under different strategies.

response:
To maximize the total points received in this game, we should evaluate the payoff structure without a contract and compare it to the outcomes under the proposed contracts.

### 1. Game Analysis (No Contract)
Without a contract, the payoff matrix for Player 1 (you) and Player 2 is:
*   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
*   (A0, A1): (0, 3)
*   (A1, A0): (3, 0)
*   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This is a coordination game with two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) offers the highest payoff (5 points), it is risky; if you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you receive 0 points. Conversely, A1 is a safer "risk-dominant" choice because it guarantees 3 points regardless of whether the other player chooses A1 or A0 (in the case of A1-A0, you get 3 and they get 0).

### 2. Contract Analysis (C1 and C2)
Both proposed contracts are identical:
*   If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player.
*   If a player chooses A1, no additional payment occurs.

Applying these transfers to the payoff matrix:
*   **(A0, A0):** (5 + 4 - 4, 5 + 4 - 4) = **(5, 5)**
*   **(A0, A1):** (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = **(4, -1)**
*   **(A1, A0):** (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = **(-1, 4)**
*   **(A1, A1):** **(3, 3)**

### 3. Strategy Under the Contract
Under Contract C1 or C2, A0 becomes a **strictly dominant strategy** for both players:
*   If Player 2 plays A0: Player 1 gets 5 points for A0 vs. -1 for A1.
*   If Player 2 plays A1: Player 1 gets 4 points for A0 vs. 3 for A1.

Since choosing A0 is always the best move for both players under the contract, they will both choose A0, resulting in an outcome of (5, 5).

### 4. Conclusion
The proposed contracts effectively remove the risk of playing A0. In the original game, (A0, A0) is the best outcome but is unstable because of the risk of receiving 0. The contract stabilizes this by ensuring that playing A0 results in a higher payoff than playing A1, regardless of the other player's decision. Therefore, the contract guarantees that you receive the maximum possible payoff of 5 points.

Since both C1 and C2 are identical and lead to this optimal outcome, they should both be approved.

{"C1": true, "C2": true}

response:
Both proposed contracts change the incentives so that **A0 becomes a strictly dominant action** for each player:

- Under **C1**, if you play **A0** you get +4 (funded by the other player), and if the other plays **A0** you pay 4. Net effect:
  - Your payoff becomes:  
    (A0,A0)=5, (A0,A1)=4, (A1,A0)=-1, (A1,A1)=3  
  - So **A0 strictly beats A1** no matter what the other player does.

- Under **C2**, A0 gives +2, A1 gives -2, with the same sort of opposite transfer based on the other player’s action. This yields the **same effective payoff table** for you as C1:
  - (A0,A0)=5, (A0,A1)=4, (A1,A0)=-1, (A1,A1)=3  
  - Again, **A0 is strictly dominant**, leading to the unique outcome (A0,A0) with payoff 5 each.

Since both contracts reliably push play to (A0,A0) and neither is better for you than the other, approving both maximizes the chance that some payoff-improving contract is selected.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

To maximize the total points received, we analyze the basic game and the proposed contracts.

### Basic Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for the basic game is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

There are two Nash equilibria: **(A0, A0)** resulting in 5 points each, and **(A1, A1)** resulting in 3 points each.

### Contract Analysis

#### Contract 1 (C1)
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- **Payoff Matrix with C1:**
    - (A0, A0): (5 + 4 - 4, 5 + 4 - 4) = (5, 5)
    - (A0, A1): (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = (4, -1)
    - (A1, A0): (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = (-1, 4)
    - (A1, A1): (3, 3)
- **Strategy:** For Player 1, A0 yields 5 or 4, while A1 yields -1 or 3. Action A0 is a **dominant strategy**. The same applies to Player 2.
- **Outcome:** C1 guarantees the (5, 5) outcome as the unique Nash equilibrium.

#### Contract 2 (C2)
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point to the other player.
- **Payoff Matrix with C2:**
    - (A0, A0): (5, 5)
    - (A0, A1): (0 + 1, 3 - 1) = (1, 2)
    - (A1, A0): (3 - 1, 0 + 1) = (2, 1)
    - (A1, A1): (3 - 1 + 1, 3 - 1 + 1) = (3, 3)
- **Strategy:** Like the original game, there are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). C2 makes A0 more attractive than in the original game but doesn't guarantee the (5, 5) outcome as strongly as C1.
- **Outcome:** Either (5, 5) or (3, 3).

### Decision-Making
- **Comparison:** C1 is strictly better than C2 because it eliminates the lower-paying (3, 3) equilibrium by making A0 a dominant strategy.
- **Approval Strategy:** According to the rules, the winning contract is chosen from those with the maximum number of approvals. If I approve only C1, it has a better chance of winning or tying for the win compared to if I approve both C1 and C2. Approving a less desirable contract (C2) only risks it winning over a more desirable contract (C1).

Thus, approving only C1 is the strategic choice to maximize the probability of receiving 5 points.

{"C1": true, "C2": false}

response:
To maximize the points received in this game, we first analyze the original payoff matrix and then evaluate how the proposed contracts modify it.

### Original Payoff Matrix
The original game (where P1 is you and P2 is the other player) is a variation of the Stag Hunt:
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

In this game, both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash Equilibria. However, (A1, A1) is the risk-dominant equilibrium because A1 is a "safer" move if you are uncertain about the other player's decision. Without a contract, players might play A1 to guarantee at least 3 points, resulting in a (3, 3) outcome.

### Contract Analysis
Contracts create additional payments that change the payoff matrix.

#### Contract 1 (C1): +4 points for playing A0 (taken from the other player)
- (A0, A0): (5 + 4 - 4), (5 + 4 - 4) = **5, 5**
- (A0, A1): (0 + 4), (3 - 4) = **4, -1**
- (A1, A0): (3 - 4), (0 + 4) = **-1, 4**
- (A1, A1): **3, 3**
Under C1, A0 becomes a strictly dominant strategy for both players. For Player 1, A0 yields 5 or 4 points, while A1 yields -1 or 3 points. Since 5 > -1 and 4 > 3, Player 1 will always choose A0. The same applies to Player 2. The equilibrium is **(5, 5)**.

#### Contract 2 (C2): +10 points for playing A0 (taken from the other player)
- (A0, A0): (5 + 10 - 10), (5 + 10 - 10) = **5, 5**
- (A0, A1): (0 + 10), (3 - 10) = **10, -7**
- (A1, A0): (3 - 10), (0 + 10) = **-7, 10**
- (A1, A1): **3, 3**
Under C2, A0 is also a strictly dominant strategy. For Player 1, A0 yields 5 or 10 points, while A1 yields -7 or 3 points. Again, the equilibrium is **(5, 5)**.

### Decision Reasoning
1. **Goal Achievement:** Both C1 and C2 convert the game into one where (A0, A0) is the guaranteed outcome (5 points for each), which is superior to the likely (3, 3) outcome of the original game.
2. **Comparison:** 
   - C1 is safer if you accidentally play A1 (lose 1 point instead of 7).
   - C2 is better if the *other player* accidentally plays A1 (you gain 10 points instead of 4).
   - Given that you are rational and intend to maximize points by choosing A0 (the dominant strategy), C2 offers a higher potential upside in the event of an opponent error.
3. **Approval Strategy:** To ensure a contract is selected, it is beneficial to approve any contract that results in the favorable (5, 5) outcome. Since both C1 and C2 incentivize both players to choose A0 and yield the same equilibrium payoff, both are highly desirable.

By approving both, you maximize the probability that the final game is played under a contract rather than the original rules.

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

Step 1: Write the original payoff matrix (Player 2 = “me”)

- (A0, A0): 5  
- (A0, A1): 0  
- (A1, A0): 3  
- (A1, A1): 3  

This is a coordination game with two pure equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

---

Step 2: Evaluate Contract 1 (proposed by Player 1)

Contract 1: choosing **A0** gives you **+5**, taken from the other player (so it’s a transfer).

Compute my (Player 2) payoffs after transfers:

- (A0, A0): both transfer 5 to each other → net 0 transfer → still **5**
- (A0, A1): I chose A0, other chose A1 → I receive 5 from them  
  Base was 0, becomes **5**
- (A1, A0): other chose A0 → they take 5 from me  
  Base was 3, becomes **-2**
- (A1, A1): no transfers → still **3**

So for me:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives -2 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives 3 → prefer A0

**A0 strictly dominates A1**, so the unique outcome is (A0,A0) and I get **5 for sure**.

---

Step 3: Evaluate Contract 2 (proposed by Player 2)

Contract 2:
- If you choose **A0**: you receive **+2** from the other player
- If you choose **A1**: you **pay 2** to the other player

My payoffs:

- (A0, A0): both pay/receive 2 → net 0 → **5**
- (A0, A1): I receive 2 (they chose A1 and pay 2)  
  Base 0 → **2**
- (A1, A0): I pay 2 (I chose A1)  
  Base 3 → **1**
- (A1, A1): both pay/receive 2 → net 0 → **3**

Best responses:
- If other plays A0: prefer A0 (5 > 1)
- If other plays A1: prefer A1 (3 > 2)

So it remains a coordination game (both (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) are equilibria). It does **not** guarantee getting 5.

---

Step 4: Approval decision (what maximizes my expected points)

- Approving **C1** pushes strongly toward a guaranteed (A0,A0) with payoff **5** for me.
- Approving **C2** risks the final selected contract being C2 (if it ties in approvals), where the play could coordinate on (A1,A1) and give me only **3**.

So I should **approve C1** and **reject C2** to avoid unnecessary randomization away from the guaranteed-5 contract.

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}

To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the payoff matrices for each contract and the base game.

**Base Payoff Matrix (C2):**
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3
In this coordination game, there are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding 5 points and (A1, A1) yielding 3 points. However, A0 is risky because if the other player chooses A1, the payoff is 0.

**Contract 1 (C1):**
- If a player chooses A0, they get +4 from the other player.
- (A0, A0): (5 + 4 - 4), (5 + 4 - 4) = 5, 5
- (A0, A1): (0 + 4), (3 - 4) = 4, -1
- (A1, A0): (3 - 4), (0 + 4) = -1, 4
- (A1, A1): 3, 3
In this scenario, for Player 1, A0 is strictly dominant:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 (5) > A1 (-1)
- If P2 plays A1: A0 (4) > A1 (3)
The same logic applies to Player 2. Since A0 is the dominant strategy for both, the equilibrium is (A0, A0) with a payoff of (5, 5). 

**Comparison:**
- **Robustness:** C1 is superior because A0 is a dominant strategy, making the (5, 5) outcome much more stable than in the base game (C2), where players might opt for the "safer" A1 to avoid 0 points.
- **Payoff Floors:** In C1, if I play A0 and the other player deviates to A1, I still receive 4 points. In C2, I would receive 0 points.
- **Player 2’s Perspective:** Player 2 should also prefer C1 because A0 becomes their dominant strategy. Even if Player 1 were to play A1, Player 2 would receive 4 points in C1 compared to 0 points in C2.

**Approval Strategy:**
Since C1 is strictly better for Player 1 regardless of the other player's move (as long as Player 1 plays optimally), I should ensure C1 has the highest probability of winning. By approving only C1, I maximize its approval count relative to C2. If I approve both, I increase the probability that C2 (the less stable contract) is selected.

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}

1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's break down the possible outcomes both with and without the contract.

### Without the Contract

First, we calculate the payoff matrix without considering the contract:

|               | Player 1: A0   | Player 1: A1   |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (5, 5)         | (0, 3)         |
| **Player 2: A1** | (3, 0)         | (3, 3)         |

- If both players choose A0, each gets 5 points.
- If Player 2 (you) chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1, you get 0 points and Player 1 gets 3 points.
- If Player 2 (you) chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0, you get 3 points and Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1, each gets 3 points.

The dominant strategy for Player 2, considering the payoff matrix alone, would be A1 because the minimum payoff (3 points) is higher than the minimum payoff of A0 (0 points).

### With the Contract

Next, we account for the contract:

- If either player chooses A0, they receive 4 additional points.
- These additional points are drawn equally from the other player.

Let's update the payoff matrix:

|               | Player 1: A0   | Player 1: A1   |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (9, 1)         | (4, -1)        |
| **Player 2: A1** | (-1, 4)        | (3, 3)         |

**Explanation:**
- If both choose A0: Each gets 5 points + 4 points from the contract, but loses 4 points to the other = 9 points for each.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 points from the game, + 4 points from contract, - 4 points paid to Player 1 = 0 points. Player 1 gets 3 points from the game, - 0 points from contract, + 4 points from contract = 4 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 from the game, - 4 points to Player 1 due to making A0, = -1 points. Player 1 gets 0 from the game, + 4 points from A0, - 0 points paid = 4 points.
- If both choose A1: Each gets 3 without any contractual exchanges = 3 points each.

### Strategic Consideration

With the contract, both choosing A0 maximizes total joint payoff but leaves an imbalance favoring Player 1 significantly if asymmetrical choices (e.g., Player 2 choosing A0 while Player 1 chooses A1). If both decide pragmatically minimizing risk, mutual A1 assures consistent moderate reward.

**Conclusion:** The contract introduces a high potential discrepancy and strategic instability. Declining the contract retains a cleaner, fair equilibrium for both maximizing consistent payoffs respecting rational choice without penal overheads.

response:
To maximize the total points received, let's analyze the game and the proposed contracts step by step.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Game
The payoff matrix for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2) is as follows (where you are Player 2):

| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

**Equilibrium Analysis:**
- If P1 plays A0, P2’s best response is A0 (5 points vs. 3 points).
- If P1 plays A1, P2’s best response is A1 (3 points vs. 0 points).
- If P2 plays A0, P1’s best response is A0 (5 points vs. 3 points).
- If P2 plays A1, P1’s best response is A1 (3 points vs. 0 points).

There are two Nash Equilibria: **(A0, A0)** resulting in (5, 5) and **(A1, A1)** resulting in (3, 3). While (A0, A0) is better for both, A1 is a "safer" strategy because it guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's choice, whereas A0 has the risk of resulting in 0 points if the players fail to coordinate.

### 2. Analysis of the Proposed Contracts (C1 and C2)
Both contracts are identical:
- Choosing A0 gives a player +4 points, taken from the other player.
- Choosing A1 involves no additional payments.

The new payoff matrix under either contract (C1 or C2) becomes:
- **(A0, A0):** P1: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5; P2: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5. Result: **(5, 5)**
- **(A0, A1):** P1: 0 + 4 - 0 = 4; P2: 3 - 4 = -1. Result: **(4, -1)**
- **(A1, A0):** P1: 3 - 4 = -1; P2: 0 + 4 - 0 = 4. Result: **(-1, 4)**
- **(A1, A1):** P1: 3; P2: 3. Result: **(3, 3)**

**Dominant Strategy Analysis under Contract:**
- For P2: If P1 plays A0, A0 (5) is better than A1 (-1). If P1 plays A1, A0 (4) is better than A1 (3).
- For P1: If P2 plays A0, A0 (5) is better than A1 (-1). If P2 plays A1, A0 (4) is better than A1 (3).

In the contracted game, **A0 is the dominant strategy** for both players. This ensures the outcome will be (A0, A0), yielding 5 points for both.

### 3. Conclusion
The contracts eliminate the coordination risk of the original game, making the highest-paying outcome (5 points) the only logical result for rational players. Therefore, both contracts are beneficial.

Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous two-player game with actions:

- A0 and A1

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (5,5) | (0,3) |
| **P2: A1** | (3,0) | (3,3) |

Note: You are **Player 2**.

Let’s analyze the base game without contracts.

#### **Best Responses**

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with probability (1-p).

Player 2’s expected payoff:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - E(A0) = p×5 + (1−p)×3 = 5p + 3 − 3p = 2p + 3

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - E(A1) = p×0 + (1−p)×3 = 3(1−p) = 3 − 3p

Find when A0 > A1:
- 2p + 3 > 3 − 3p → 5p > 0 → p > 0

So, for any p > 0, A0 is better than A1.

At p = 0 (Player 1 always plays A1), E(A0) = 3, E(A1) = 3 → indifferent.

But since A0 is at least as good for all p ≥ 0, and strictly better when p > 0, **Player 2 always prefers A0** unless Player 1 is strictly playing A1.

Now analyze Player 1's incentives.

Player 1’s payoff:

- A0: p×5 + (1−p)×0 = 5p
- A1: p×3 + (1−p)×3 = 3

So Player 1 prefers A0 when 5p > 3 → p > 3/5 = 0.6

So:
- If p < 0.6 → A1 better
- If p > 0.6 → A0 better
- p = 0.6 → indifferent

So **if Player 1 believes Player 2 plays A0 with p > 0.6, A0 is best; otherwise, A1.**

Now, **Nash equilibrium analysis:**

Let’s look for mixed strategy equilibrium.

Suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q).

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 5q + 0×(1−q) = 5q
- A1: 3q + 3×(1−q) = 3q + 3 − 3q = 3

Player 1 is indifferent when 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So Player 1 mixes only if q = 0.6.

Now assume Player 1 plays A0 with probability p.

Player 2’s payoff:
- A0: 5p + 0×(1−p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3×(1−p) = 3

Player 2 indifferent when 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So there is a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**: both play A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

But is this efficient?

The problem is that the **race to cooperate** is flawed. If both play A0, both get 5 — that’s best for both.

But there’s a temptation to defect: if the other plays A0, choosing A1 gets you 3 vs 0 — better than 5? No, wait.

Actually, **if you play A1 while the other plays A0**, you get **3**, but if you play A0, you get **5** — so A0 is better.

But if the other plays A1, you get 3 for A1 → same as if you played A0? No:

Wait — If you play **A0** and the other plays **A1**: you get 0  
If you play **A1** and the other plays **A1**: you get 3

So, when other plays A1, your best response is A1.

So:
- If other plays A0 → you play A0 → get 5
- If other plays A1 → you play A1 → get 3

So it’s **not** that A0 is always best.

Let’s recheck:

If you’re Player 2:
- If P1 plays A0 → you prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If P1 plays A1 → you prefer A1 (3 > 0)

So best response:
- A0 if P1 plays A0
- A1 if P1 plays A1

So you want to match.

That leads to **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

And in the mixed equilibrium, both mix at 0.6.

But (A0, A0) is **Pareto superior**: both get 5 > 3.

So the problem is **coordination**: both want to play A0 to get 5, but it’s risky.

But in the asymmetric case — if you play A0 and the other plays A1 — you get 0, which is worse.

So there's a temptation to **defect to A1** if you think the other might play A1.

But actually, in this game, **A0 is the safe choice if you trust the other to play A0**, but both players prefer the A0,A0 outcome.

But in equilibrium, it’s uncertain.

But the important point: **if both players play A0, both get 5 — maximum total**

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Payment Contracts**

Now there’s a **contract system**: players can propose contracts that specify **additional payments** based on your action.

**Approval voting**: both players can approve contracts. The contract with **most approvals** wins, chosen **uniformly at random** if ties.

You are **Player 2**, and your goal is to **maximize your total expected points**.

#### **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other player.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So:  
- If you play A0 → you gain +4 points (but the other player loses 4, split equally — so you get +4, opponent loses 2 from you, 2 from the other? Wait — "drawn equally from the other players" — singular? But it's a two-player game.

Let’s interpret:

> "they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So: **you get +4**, and the **other player loses 4 total**, so **each player loses 2?**

But actually: “drawn equally from the other players” — but there is only one other player.

So the **same other player pays 4** (not split). Likely "equally" is redundant.

So interpretation:
- If you choose A0: you get +4, the other player gets -4.
- If you choose A1: no change.

So: **A0 now gives you +4 extra**, but only if you choose it.

So this contract adds **4 points to your payoff** if you play A0, **and subtracts 4 from the other player** in that case.

This is a **transfer from the other player to you** when you choose A0.

So **your payoff** becomes:

- A0: original payoff + 4
- A1: original payoff + 0

Now, from **your perspective** (Player 2), what matters is: **how does this change your incentives and possible outcomes?**

Let’s analyze your expected payoff under this contract.

#### **C1: How does it change your play?**

You are Player 2.

Let P1 play A0 with probability p.

Your payoffs under C1:

- If you play A0: original payoff: 5p + 3(1−p) = 2p + 3 → now **+4** → total: 2p + 7
- If you play A1: original payoff: 0×p + 3×(1−p) = 3(1−p) → now **+0** → total: 3 − 3p

So you compare:
- A0: 2p + 7
- A1: 3 − 3p

You prefer A0 when:
2p + 7 ≥ 3 − 3p → 5p ≥ −4 → p ≥ −0.8 → always true!

So **you will always prefer A0**, for any p.

Even if P1 plays A1 100% → p=0:
- A0: 0 + 7 = 7
- A1: 3 − 0 = 3 → A0 still better

So **under C1, you are incentivized to always play A0**, regardless of what P1 does.

Now, what about P1?

P1’s perspective under C1:

- If P1 plays A0: they get +4 (since they played A0), so their payoff is:
  - If you (P2) play A0: 5 + 4 = 9 (from original) → but wait, sequence:

Wait: **C1 says "if a player chooses A0, they receive +4, drawn from the other player"**

So **both players get +4 when they play A0?**

No: if **you (P2)** play A0 → you get +4, and **P1 loses 4**

If **P1** plays A0 → P1 gets +4, and **you (P2)** lose 4?

That can’t be — that would be inconsistent.

Wait: **contract specifies: “if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”**

So **each player who plays A0 gets +4**, paid **by the other player(s)**.

Since only two players, if **both play A0**, then:
- You (P2) get +4 from P1
- P1 gets +4 from you

So net transfer: you give +4 to P1, and P1 gives +4 to you → net 0.

But if only one plays A0:
- That player gets +4, the other loses 4.

Ah — so **it's symmetric**.

So the transfer rule is: **whenever a player chooses A0, they get +4, paid by the other player(s)**.

So if both choose A0:
- You get +4 from P1
- P1 gets +4 from you
- Net: zero

If you choose A0, P1 chooses A1:
- You get +4
- P1 gets 0 (didn't play A0)
- So P1 loses 4 (to you)

If you choose A1, P1 chooses A0:
- P1 gets +4 from you
- You get 0
- You lose 4

So let’s write the full payoff matrix under C1.

Let’s denote total payoff = original payoff + transfer.

#### **Payoffs under C1 (Player 1, Player 2)**

1. P1: A0, P2: A0  
   - Original: (5,5)  
   - Transfers: both get +4  
   - Final: (9,9)

2. P1: A0, P2: A1  
   - Original: (0,3)  
   - P1 gets +4 (played A0), P2 played A1 → no bonus, but P2 is the one who gives to P1  
     → so P2 loses 4 (because P1 played A0)  
   - Final: (0 + 4, 3 − 4) = (4, -1)

3. P1: A1, P2: A0  
   - Original: (3,0)  
   - P2 played A0 → gets +4  
   - P1 played A1 → no bonus  
   - So P1 loses 4 to P2  
   - Final: (3 − 4, 0 + 4) = (-1, 4)

4. P1: A1, P2: A1  
   - Original: (3,3)  
   - Neither played A0 → no transfer  
   - Final: (3,3)

So new payoff matrix (P1, P2):

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | (9,9) | (-1,4) |
| **P2: A1** | (4,-1) | (3,3) |

Now, analyze best responses.

As **Player 2**:

- If P1 plays A0: you get 9 (A0) vs 4 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: you get -1 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So your best response depends on P1.

But now, constraint: if you play A0, you get a big gain only if P1 also plays A0 (9), but if P1 plays A1, you get -1 → worse than A1 (3)

But now look: **if you play A0 when P1 plays A1**, you get -1 — terrible.

So you only want to play A0 if you believe P1 plays A0.

But P1’s perspective:

- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 9 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P1 always prefers A0**, no matter what P2 does.

So: **P1 has a dominant strategy: A0**

Therefore, **P1 will play A0**.

Given that, you (P2) should play A0 → get 9

So **equilibrium: both play A0** → (9,9)

Which is even better than base game (5,5)

So under C1, **you can expect to get 9 points**

Big gain.

But wait: what if P1 doesn’t cooperate?

But since A0 is **dominant** for P1, **P1 will always play A0**, so you can safely play A0 → get 9.

So **under C1, you are guaranteed 9 points** (in equilibrium).

Important: even if this is not a Nash in the original, it is now due to incentives.

So **C1 is very good for you**.

But could be bad for P1? Yes — but they are not choosing, and we want to **approve** contracts that benefit *you*.

Now… **payouts are not the issue — the contract needs approval**.

But if you approve C1, and if P1 approves it (they proposed it, likely will), then C1 has two approvals → probably wins.

But let’s check the other contract.

---

#### **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So: **no changes at all**.

This is equivalent to **no contract** — the base game.

So payoffs are unchanged.

So under C2, the game remains as is.

You can get **either 5 (if both play A0)** or **3 (if both play A1)**, or possibly less.

But in equilibrium, you might end up at (A0,A0), or (A1,A1), or mixed.

But worst case, you might get **0** if you play A0 and P1 plays A1.

But since P1 might not want to play A0 (because if they play A0 and you play A1, they get 0, while if they play A1, they get 3), so mixed strategies are likely.

Previously, we found a mixed equilibrium where both play A0 with 0.6.

So expected payoff for Player 2 in mixed equilibrium:

- p = 0.6 (P1 plays A0)
- You play A0 with 0.6 (if mimicking)

But under C2, your expected payoff is:

- If you play A0: 5×0.6 + 0×0.4 = 3
- If you play A1: 3×0.6 + 3×0.4 = 3

So indifferent → you can play any mix → expected payoff = 3

Wait — that’s only if you play A0 with 0.6.

But in full mixed strategy equilibrium, both mix with q = 0.6.

Then your expected payoff:

= P(P1=A0) × (your payoff | P1=A0) + P(P1=A1) × (your payoff | P1=A1)

You choose A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4

So:

- P(P1=A0) = 0.6 → then P(you play A0) = 0.6 → get 5
- P(P1=A1) = 0.4 → then P(you play A0) = 0.6 → get 0

So E = 0.6×(0.6×5 + 0.4×3) → no, better:

Your expected payoff =  
= P(P1=A0) × [P(you=A0 | P1=A0) × 5 + P(you=A1 | P1=A0) × 0]  
+ P(P1=A1) × [P(you=A0 | P1=A1) × 3 + P(you=A1 | P1=A1) × 3]

But in symmetric mixed strategy Nash, player 2 chooses A0 with 0.6 regardless.

So:

= 0.6 × (0.6×5 + 0.4×0) + 0.4 × (0.6×3 + 0.4×3)  
= 0.6 × (3) + 0.4 × (1.8 + 1.2)  
= 1.8 + 0.4 × 3 = 1.8 + 1.2 = 3.0

So expected payoff = 3

Alternatively, in (A0,A0) equilibrium: payoff = 5

But that’s only if both mutually agree.

But with no contract, and misaligned incentives, it’s not guaranteed.

In fact, since each player has incentive to deviate if they think the other will play A0, it’s risky.

But the **average expected payoff under the mixed equilibrium is 3**, and in better outcomes like (A0,A0) you get 5, but risk getting 0.

But **you cannot guarantee** 5.

So under C2, your **expected payoff is likely around 3 or less**.

Whereas under C1, you can **guarantee 9**, because P1 has a dominant strategy to play A0, so you just need to play A0 → get 9.

So **C1 gives you a guaranteed 9**, while **C2 gives you expected 3 at best**, with risk of 0.

So C1 is **much better**.

---

### **Step 3: Approval Strategy**

You want to maximize your **total points**.

So which contracts should you approve?

- **C1**: proposed by Player 1 — gives you 9 → **approve**
- **C2**: no change — gives you ~3 → **do not approve**

But wait: **could C1 fail?**

Only if P1 doesn’t play A0.

But under C1, **P1 has a dominant strategy: A0**

Because:
- If you play A0 → P1 gets 9 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → better to play A0
- If you play A1 → P1 gets 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → better to play A0

So **A0 is dominant** for P1 → they **will** play A0.

Then you, knowing that, play A0 → get 9.

So **no risk**.

Thus, C1 is safe and great.

C2 is worse.

Therefore, you should **approve C1**, **not approve C2**.

But do you have to approve C2?

No — you can approve only the ones that benefit you.

Now, **winning rule**: the contract with the **maximum number of approvals** is selected **uniformly at random**.

So:

- If you approve only C1, and P1 (who proposed it) probably approves C1 → then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 (if you don’t approve) → C1 wins.

- If you approve C2, it might tie or be less.

But since C2 is worse, **you shouldn’t approve it**.

Even if C2 gets more approvals, it gives you less.

So **maximize your payoff**: only approve C1.

---

### **Final Decision**

- **C1 (Player 1's contract)**: HIGHLY beneficial — gives you 9 guaranteed → **approve**
- **C2 (Player 2's contract)**: no benefit, worse outcome → **do not approve**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To decide whether to sign the payment contract, we need to analyze the payoff structure both with and without the contract.

### Original Game Analysis
Without the contract, the payoff matrix is as follows:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this scenario, there are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding 5 points each, and (A1, A1) yielding 3 points each. While (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant, (A1, A1) is also a potential stable outcome. If a player fears the other will choose A1, they are incentivized to choose A1 as well (3 > 0).

### Contract Analysis
The contract specifies that if a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
Let's see the new payoffs if the contract is signed by both:
- **(A0, A0):**
    - Player 1: 5 (original) + 4 (from P2) - 4 (to P2) = 5
    - Player 2: 5 (original) + 4 (from P1) - 4 (to P1) = 5
- **(A0, A1):**
    - Player 1: 0 (original) + 4 (from P2) = 4
    - Player 2: 3 (original) - 4 (to P1) = -1
- **(A1, A0):**
    - Player 1: 3 (original) - 4 (to P2) = -1
    - Player 2: 0 (original) + 4 (from P1) = 4
- **(A1, A1):**
    - Player 1: 3 (original) = 3
    - Player 2: 3 (original) = 3

### Strategic Shift
Under the contract:
- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 5 for A0 and -1 for A1. (5 > -1)
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 4 for A0 and 3 for A1. (4 > 3)

For Player 1, **A0 is now a dominant strategy** (it is always the best move regardless of what the other player does). The same logic applies to Player 2. This guarantees that both players will choose A0, resulting in a payoff of (5, 5).

### Conclusion
By signing the contract, you transition from a game where you might get stuck in a lower-payoff equilibrium (A1, A1) or a coordination failure (0 points) to a game where choosing A0 is the dominant strategy, ensuring the maximum available payoff of 5 points. Since you proposed the contract, it aligns with your objective to maximize total points.

response:
The provided decision-making game involves two players choosing between two actions, A0 and A1. Let's analyze the game with and without the contract.

### Original Game Analysis
The original payoff matrix (P1, P2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two Nash equilibria: **(A0, A0)** yielding 5 points each and **(A1, A1)** yielding 3 points each. However, (A1, A1) is the maximin outcome (the safest choice if you are unsure of the other player's move), as A1 guarantees at least 3 points, while A0 could result in 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

### Contract Analysis
The proposed contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points and the other player loses 4 points.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

If both players sign, the new payoff matrix becomes:
- **(A0, A0)**: (5 + 4 - 4, 5 + 4 - 4) = **(5, 5)**
- **(A0, A1)**: (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = **(4, -1)**
- **(A1, A0)**: (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = **(-1, 4)**
- **(A1, A1)**: **(3, 3)**

### Strategic Benefits of the Contract
1.  **Dominant Strategy**: In the contracted game, action A0 becomes a strictly dominant strategy for both players. If the other player chooses A0, you get 5 with A0 versus -1 with A1. If the other player chooses A1, you get 4 with A0 versus 3 with A1. Therefore, A0 is always better.
2.  **Risk Mitigation**: In the original game, choosing A0 carries the risk of getting 0 if the other player chooses A1. With the contract, choosing A0 guarantees at least 4 points, making it safer and more profitable than choosing A1.
3.  **Coordination**: The contract effectively eliminates (A1, A1) as a viable equilibrium and forces the players toward the optimal outcome of (5, 5).

Since the contract makes the highest possible payoff (5 points) the result of a dominant strategy, it is in Player 1's best interest to sign it.

To maximize the points received, we first analyze the base game and then the game with the proposed contract.

**Base Game Analysis:**
The payoff matrix for the base game is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) with a payoff of 5 and (A1, A1) with a payoff of 3. While (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant (yielding 5 points each), (A1, A1) is risk-dominant. If a player is uncertain about the other's choice, playing A1 is "safer" because it guarantees 3 points regardless of the other's action, whereas choosing A0 risks receiving 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

**Contract Game Analysis:**
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points, and the other player pays 4 points.
- If a player chooses A1, no payment occurs.

If both players sign the contract, the payoffs are adjusted as follows:
- **(A0, A0):** P1 gets 5 + 4 (for A0) - 4 (P2's A0) = 5. P2 gets 5 + 4 - 4 = 5. (Result: 5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** P1 gets 0 + 4 = 4. P2 gets 3 - 4 = -1. (Result: 4, -1)
- **(A1, A0):** P1 gets 3 - 4 = -1. P2 gets 0 + 4 = 4. (Result: -1, 4)
- **(A1, A1):** No adjustments. (Result: 3, 3)

New Payoff Matrix (Contracted):
- A0 vs A0: (5, 5)
- A0 vs A1: (4, -1)
- A1 vs A0: (-1, 4)
- A1 vs A1: (3, 3)

In this contracted game, switching from the "safe" action (A1) to the "risky" action (A0) is strictly beneficial for Player 1 regardless of what Player 2 does (if P2 plays A0, 5 > -1; if P2 plays A1, 4 > 3). A0 becomes a **strictly dominant strategy**.

**Conclusion:**
Signing the contract transforms a coordination game with a risk-safe but lower-value equilibrium (3, 3) into a game where the highest-value outcome (5, 5) is achieved by strictly dominant strategies. Since the contract was proposed by Player 2, they are highly likely to sign it as well. Signing ensures that Player 1 can pursue the 5-point outcome with a "safety net" (4 points) even if Player 2 chooses A1.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
The game presents a coordination challenge with two possible Nash equilibria in its original form: (A0, A0) yielding 5 points each, and (A1, A1) yielding 3 points each. While (A0, A0) is Pareto superior, (A1, A1) is safer for a player who is uncertain about their opponent's move because playing A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's choice, whereas playing A0 could lead to 0 points if the other player plays A1.

The proposed contract changes the payoff matrix by awarding 4 points to any player who chooses A0 (this payment is taken from the other player) and 0 points for choosing A1.

Let's re-calculate the payoffs with the contract active:
1. **(A0, A0):** 
   - Player 1: 5 (base) + 4 (from playing A0) - 4 (taken by Player 2's A0) = 5
   - Player 2: 5 (base) + 4 (from playing A0) - 4 (taken by Player 1's A0) = 5
2. **(A0, A1):** 
   - Player 1: 0 (base) + 4 (from playing A0) - 0 (Player 2 chose A1) = 4
   - Player 2: 3 (base) + 0 (from playing A1) - 4 (taken by Player 1's A0) = -1
3. **(A1, A0):** 
   - Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 (from playing A1) - 4 (taken by Player 2's A0) = -1
   - Player 2: 0 (base) + 4 (from playing A0) - 0 (Player 1 chose A1) = 4
4. **(A1, A1):** 
   - Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 - 0 = 3
   - Player 2: 3 (base) + 0 - 0 = 3

In the contract-active game, A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players:
- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 5 for A0 vs -1 for A1.
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 4 for A0 vs 3 for A1.

By signing the contract, both players make A0 their dominant strategy, which virtually guarantees an outcome of 5 points. Without the contract, players might default to the risk-dominant A1 strategy to avoid the 0-point outcome, leading to only 3 points. Therefore, signing the contract is the optimal decision to maximize points.

response:
To determine the best strategy for this game, let's analyze the payoffs and Player 1's incentives thoroughly.

In this game, the payoffs for various combinations of actions are as follows:

1. If you (Player 2) choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A0: both get 5 points.
2. If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: you get 0 points and Player 1 gets 3 points.
3. If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: you get 3 points and Player 1 gets 0 points.
4. If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A1: both get 3 points.

Given these payoffs, let’s determine the initial pure strategies:

- **If both players chose A0**, they both get a high payoff (5 points).
- **If Player 2 (you) chooses A0**, and Player 1 chooses A1, you get a low payoff (0 points), potentially incentivizing Player 1 to switch.
- **If both players chose A1**, both get a moderately high payoff (3 points), which is still better than a 0 point payoff.

Given the rejection of the contract and the understanding of the situation, Player 1 might still want to aim for higher payoffs without the extra payment manipulation. Without the contract:

- Player 1 would prefer that both choose A0 (Payoff: 5 points each) over both choosing A1 (Payoff: 3 points each) when there's no commitment.

We need to determine our probabilities such that we maximize our own expected payoff:

If Player 1 believes you heavily favor A0:
- They might prefer sticking with A0 for consistency.

However, if Player 1 might think you could mix between A0 and A1:
- They might consider diversifying their choices accordingly.

Given the payoffs higher when coordinating on A0, Player 1 might favor A0 too, but they wouldn't want to consistently lose by predicting A1.

A mixed strategy equilibrium might make sense given you rejected the contract- here’s a valid strategic diversion between A0 and A1:

Possible consideration ratios:
- Balanced approach ensuring fluctuation in prediction 

Let’s consider a balanced approach, where we distribute our choices:
- A0: 50% 
- A1: 50%

Given the above analysis, the JSON object to represent this strategy:

To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the modified payoff matrix based on the base game rules and the additional payment contract.

**Base Payoffs (P1, P2):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Contract Effects:**
- If P1 chooses A0, they receive 4 points from P2.
- If P2 chooses A0, they receive 4 points from P1.
- If both choose A0, the payments cancel out: P1 gets (+4, -4) = 0 net, P2 gets (+4, -4) = 0 net.
- If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1: P1 gets +4 points, and P2 loses 4 points.
- If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0: P1 loses 4 points, and P2 gets +4 points.
- If both choose A1: no payments are made.

**Final Payoff Matrix (P1, P2):**
- **(A0, A0):** (5+0, 5+0) = **(5, 5)**
- **(A0, A1):** (0+4, 3-4) = **(4, -1)**
- **(A1, A0):** (3-4, 0+4) = **(-1, 4)**
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3) = **(3, 3)**

**Strategic Analysis (for Player 1):**
- If Player 2 chooses **A0**: Player 1 receives 5 points by choosing A0 and -1 point by choosing A1.
- If Player 2 chooses **A1**: Player 1 receives 4 points by choosing A0 and 3 points by choosing A1.
In both scenarios, choosing **A0** yields a higher payoff for Player 1 (5 > -1 and 4 > 3). Thus, A0 is the strictly dominant strategy.

**Strategic Analysis (for Player 2):**
- If Player 1 chooses **A0**: Player 2 receives 5 points by choosing A0 and -1 point by choosing A1.
- If Player 1 chooses **A1**: Player 2 receives 4 points by choosing A0 and 3 points by choosing A1.
Similarly, **A0** is the strictly dominant strategy for Player 2.

Since both players have A0 as their dominant strategy, the equilibrium is for both to play A0 with 100% probability. This results in the highest possible individual and collective payoff in the context of this game's Nash Equilibrium.

Let's break down the decision-making process for each contract, focusing on how they affect your potential points under each scenario.

### Basic Game Payoffs 

Without any contract:
1. If both choose A0: Player 2 gets 5 points.
2. If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 points.
3. If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 points.
4. If both choose A1: Player 2 gets 3 points.

### Proposed Contracts Analysis

#### Contract Proposed by Player 1 ("C1"):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

##### Impact on Payoffs:

1. Both choose A0:
   - Player 2 receives: \(5 (game) + 5 (payment) - 5 (to other player) = 5\) points.
   - So no net change for A0 from the standard game.
  
2. Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1:
   - Player 2: \(0 (game) + 5 (payment) - 5 (to other player) = 0\) points.
  
3. Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0:
   - Player 2: \(3 (game) - 5 (to other player) = -2\) points, which is worse.
  
4. Both choose A1:
   - Player 2: \(3 (game)\), unchanged from the standard game.

Thus, "C1" makes A0 more attractive only if Player 1 also chooses A0. Choosing A1 becomes risky if the other player chooses A0.

#### Contract Proposed by Player 2 ("C2"):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point distributed equally among the other players.

##### Impact on Payoffs:

1. Both choose A0:
   - Player 2: \(5 (game) + 1 (payment) - 1 (to other player) = 5\) points (no net change).
  
2. Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1:
   - Player 2: \(0 (game) + 1 (payment) - 1 (to other player) = 0\) points.
  
3. Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0:
   - Player 2: \(3 (game) - 1 (to other player) = 2\) points (worse).

4. Both choose A1:
   - Player 2: \(3 (game) - 1 (payment) = 2\) points.

"C2" modestly rewards A0, and mitigates A1 slightly. But with A0, there is little change if both players choose A0.

### Summary and Recommendations

Both contracts make action A0 a bit more attractive and action A1 less so, but:
- "C1" has a drastic impact on penalizing A1 when the other player chooses A0, while mildly rewarding both for choosing A0.
- "C2" has a milder impact overall but makes sure the benefits and risks are balanced.

Given the above impact analysis, approving your own contract "C2" would be the best way to ensure an optimal strategy and maintain balance in rewards.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game without the contract**

The original game is a symmetric two-player game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1's choice → rows, Player 2's choice → columns; payoffs are (Player 1, Player 2)):

```
          Player 1
          A0      A1
Player 2
A0      (5,5)   (0,3)
A1      (3,0)   (3,3)
```

This is a variant of a coordination game with a twist: choosing A0 when the other chooses A1 is very bad for you (0 points), but choosing A1 when the other chooses A0 gives you 3 points, and both choosing A1 gives 3 each.

Note:
- A0 is best when both choose A0 (5 each).
- A0 is worse than A1 if the other chooses A1 (0 vs 3).
- A1 is safe: it gives 3 regardless of the other player’s choice (if they choose A0, you get 3; if they choose A1, you get 3).

So, **A1 is a dominant strategy** in the original game:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1.
- If Player 1 plays A1 → you get 3 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → same.

Wait: A0 gives 3 when opponent plays A1, same as A1 → so A0 is **not worse** than A1 in that case.

But when opponent plays A0:
- A0 → 5
- A1 → 3

So A0 is better if opponent plays A0.

Thus, **no pure dominant strategy**, but A1 is a weakly dominant in some sense?

Let’s compute expected payoffs.

But first, let's consider: what is the best response?

- If you believe the other will play A0, best to play A0 → get 5.
- If you believe the other will play A1, best to play A1 → get 3 (A0 gives 0).

So A0 is best if opponent likely plays A0, A1 if opponent likely plays A1.

So it's a coordination game where both prefer (A0,A0), but if unsure, A1 is safer.

In the original game, both players might choose A0 (for 5-5) or both choose A1 (for 3-3), but (A0,A1) is very bad for Player 2.

Therefore, a rational player might aim for coordination on A0, especially if they think the other will choose A0.

But if there's uncertainty, A1 is a safer option.

---

### **Step 2: Introduce the contract**

The contract says:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other player.

> If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So, the contract modifies the payoff structure **only when a player chooses A0**.

Let’s analyze what this means.

Suppose **you choose A0**:
- You get 4 extra points (reward).
- But this 4 points is "drawn equally from the other players" → implies that the other player loses 4 points (since it’s drawn from them).

But **"drawn equally from the other players"** — there is only one other player. So if you play A0, you gain 4, the other player loses 4 — total transfer: +4 to you, -4 to them.

So:
- Your payoff increases by 4 when you play A0.
- The other player’s payoff decreases by 4 when you play A0.

But note: this only applies when **you** play A0.

If you play A1, no effect.

Importantly: **this bonus is only applied if the player chooses A0.**

So the contract **incentivizes A0** for you — you get +4 for playing A0, regardless of what the other player does.

But the other player **must also sign** the contract for it to be active. If not, it's not active.

We are told: “The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.”

So you must decide whether to sign.

But **Player 1 proposed** the contract. So they likely signed (or at least, we assume they are willing to sign if you do). But you're deciding whether to sign.

We are to maximize **your own total expected points**.

---

### **Step 3: What happens if you sign the contract?**

Let’s assume **you sign** → the contract is active only if **both sign**, so **we must assume Player 1 also signs** for the contract to be in effect.

So, under the contract (active, both signed), the **payoffs change**.

Let’s rewrite the payoff matrix **under the contract**.

We are Player 2.

We will compute your payoff for each combination of actions.

---

#### Case 1: You play A0, Player 1 plays A0
- Base payoff: (5,5)
- But both play A0 → each gets +4 bonus (because each chose A0)
- So Player 2 gets 5 + 4 = 9
- Player 1 gets 5 + 4 = 9
- BUT: the bonus is “drawn equally from the other players” — so if you play A0, you gain 4, and the other player loses 4.

So let’s be precise.

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- When you play A0 → you gain 4 → that 4 is taken from the other player.
- It **does not** mean each player gets 4 and the other loses 4? Wait — “drawn equally from the other players” — only one other player → so the other player loses 4.

But **this happens for every player who plays A0**.

So if **you play A0**, you gain 4, Player 1 loses 4.

If **Player 1 plays A0**, Player 1 gains 4, you lose 4.

This is **not symmetric** in effect — each person who plays A0 gets +4, but each **loses 4 to the other player**.

Wait — that would mean **if both play A0**:
- You gain 4 (because you played A0), but you **lose 4** (because Player 1 played A0)
- So net: 0 change from contract?
- Similarly for Player 1.

But that can’t be — if both play A0, each gets +4 (for playing A0), but each loses 4 to the other player → net zero from contract.

But that would eliminate the incentive.

Alternatively, the phrasing "drawn equally from the other players" may mean that the 4 points are taken from the other players **collectively**, and distributed to the player who plays A0.

So if **only you play A0**, you get +4, Player 1 loses 4.

If **only Player 1 plays A0**, Player 1 gets +4, you lose 4.

If **both play A0**, you each get +4 (from playing A0), but each has to give +4 to the other (because the other plays A0)? That would cause net zero for each.

But that doesn't make sense — you're giving 4 to the other while receiving 4 → net zero.

But the contract says "drawn equally from the other players" — so if both play A0, each "draws" 4 from the other → but you give 4 to the other and get 4 from them → net zero.

So both players get **zero net effect** from the contract if both play A0.

But if **only you play A0**, you get +4 (from contract), and Player 1 loses 4 (from being the "other") → net: +4 to you, -4 to Player 1.

If **only Player 1 plays A0**, same: you lose 4, Player 1 gains 4.

But if **neither plays A0**, no change.

So now, let’s compute the **total payoff to you** under the contract for each combination.

---

#### Contract-active payoffs (Player 2's payoff):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0                | A1                |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **A0**              | 5 + 4 (from contract) - 4 (contract cost from P1) = 5 | 5 + 4 = 9 (you play A0, P1 plays A1 → you gain 4, P1 loses 4) |
| **A1**              | 3 (no A0 → no bonus or cost) | 3 (no A0 → no bonus or cost) |

Wait:

- If you play A0 and P1 plays A0:
  - You gain 4 (because you played A0)
  - You lose 4 (because P1 played A0)
  - Net contract effect: 0
  - Base: 5 → total: 5

- If you play A0 and P1 plays A1:
  - You gain 4 (because you played A0)
  - P1 did not play A0 → so you don’t lose anything to P1
  - So you get +4
  - Base: 5 (you play A0, P1 plays A1) → but wait, original: you choose A0, P1 chooses A1 → you get 0 points!
  - Oh! I made a critical error.

Let’s go back to the **original payoff**.

Original:
- (A0, A0): you get 5
- (A0, A1): you get 0
- (A1, A0): you get 3
- (A1, A1): you get 3

So in the case where **you play A0 and P1 plays A1**, you get **0** from the base game.

Now, you play A0 → so you get +4 (bonus), and P1 plays A1 → so no penalty to you.

So total for you: 0 + 4 = 4

Similarly:
- If you play A0 and P1 plays A0: you get 5 (base), but you gain 4 (for playing A0), and P1 gains 4 (for playing A0) → but that means you give 4 to P1? No.

Wait — the contract says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So **you** get +4, and that 4 is **taken from the other player(s)**.

So if you play A0 → you gain 4, the other player loses 4.

If P1 plays A0 → P1 gains 4, you lose 4.

So if **both play A0**:
- You gain 4 (from playing A0), but lose 4 (because P1 played A0) → net 0
- P1 gains 4, but loses 4 (from you) → net 0
- Base: 5 → so you get 5

If only **you play A0**, P1 plays A1:
- You gain 4 (from playing A0)
- P1 does not play A0 → so you don’t lose anything to P1
- So you gain 4
- Base: 0 (from (A0,A1)) → total: 0 + 4 = 4

If **P1 plays A0**, you play A1:
- You don’t play A0 → so no gain
- P1 plays A0 → P1 gains 4, you lose 4
- Base: 3 (A1 vs A0) → 3 - 4 = -1

If **both play A1**:
- No one plays A0 → no gain or loss
- Base: 3 → total: 3

So let’s build the full payoff matrix under the contract **from your perspective (Player 2)**:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0            | A1            |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**             | 5             | 4             |
| **A1**             | -1            | 3             |

Let’s verify:

- (A0,A0): base 5, you gain 4, lose 4 → net 0 → 5+0 = 5 ✓
- (A0,A1): base 0, you gain 4, no loss → 0+4 = 4 ✓
- (A1,A0): base 3, you lose 4 (because P1 plays A0) → 3-4 = -1 ✓
- (A1,A1): base 3, no action → 3 ✓

So your new payoff matrix is:

```
          A0      A1
A0       5       4
A1      -1       3
```

Now, can we analyze rational choices?

Let’s see: what is your best response?

Suppose you think P1 will play A0:
- You get 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → choose A0

Suppose you think P1 will play A1:
- You get 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → choose A0

So **A0 is always better** for you, regardless of P1’s choice.

- If P1 plays A0: 5 > -1 → A0
- If P1 plays A1: 4 > 3 → A0

So **A0 is a dominant strategy** under the contract.

Moreover:
- A0 gives at least 4, A1 gives at most 3.

So you **must** play A0 if the contract is active.

Similarly, let’s check P1’s incentives.

P1’s payoff matrix under the contract:

| P1 \ P2 | A0            | A1            |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| A0      | 5             | 4             |
| A1      | -1            | 3             |

Same logic: for P1, A0 is dominant strategy.

So under the contract, **both players have A0 as dominant strategy** → both will play A0 → outcome is (A0,A0) → you get **5 points**.

Wait: under contract, (A0,A0) gives you 5 (as calculated).

But is that right?

Earlier: (A0,A0): base 5, contract effect: +4 (as A0 player), -4 (as victim of other A0 player) → net 0 → total 5.

Yes.

Now, if the contract were **not active**, what would happen?

In the original game, without contract:

Payoff matrix (Player 2):

| P2\P1 | A0 | A1 |
|-------|----|----|
| A0    | 5  | 0  |
| A1    | 3  | 3  |

What is the equilibrium?

- If P1 plays A0: you prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If P1 plays A1: you prefer A1 (3 > 0)

So if you believe P1 plays A0 → you play A0
If you believe P1 plays A1 → you play A1

No dominant strategy.

Possible equilibria:
- (A0, A0) — mutual best response
- (A1, A1) — mutual best response

Which one? It depends on beliefs.

But in the absence of communication, both could be plausible.

But note: (A0,A0) gives 5-5, (A1,A1) gives 3-3.

So (A0,A0) is better for both.

But if you’re uncertain, you might play A1 to avoid 0.

However, if you think P1 will play A0, you’ll play A0.

Assume symmetry: both players think the same.

Then, if both coordinate on A0, they get 5 each.

But if they miscoordinate, you get 0.

So the risk of miscoordination might make players choose A1.

But (A1,A1) is a safe equilibrium.

So in the original game, **likely equilibrium is (A1,A1)**, where both get 3, avoiding the risk of 0.

Alternatively, if they can coordinate, (A0,A0) is better.

But without communication, (A1,A1) might be more likely.

But since you’re trying to **maximize expected points**, you need to consider your expected payoff under each scenario.

---

### **Step 4: Compare whether to sign the contract**

#### Option 1: Do **not** sign the contract

Then contract is inactive.

Payoff matrix (original):

| P2\P1 | A0 | A1 |
|-------|----|----|
| A0    | 5  | 0  |
| A1    | 3  | 3  |

Now, what is your expected payoff?

Assume rational play. The outcome could be:
- (A0,A0) — 5 points
- (A1,A1) — 3 points
- (A0,A1) or (A1,A0) — 0 or 3, but asymmetric

But (A0,A1) gives you 0 — very bad.

So if you're risk-averse, or just want to secure 3, you might choose A1.

But if you believe P1 will play A0, you’ll play A0 → get 5.

But if you’re uncertain, you may play A1.

Let’s compute **expected payoff assuming symmetry and Nash equilibrium**.

Best symmetric strategy?

Suppose both play A0 with probability p.

Then your expected payoff if you play A0:
- P(P1 plays A0) = p → get 5
- P(P1 plays A1) = 1-p → get 0
- Expected: 5p

If you play A1:
- P(P1 plays A0) = p → get 3
- P(P1 plays A1) = 1-p → get 3
- Expected: 3

So you play A0 if 5p > 3 → p > 0.6

If p < 0.6, you play A1.

But both players do the same.

So symmetric equilibrium:

Either:
- p = 0: both play A1 → payoff 3
- p = 1: both play A0 → payoff 5
- Or mixed: p such that 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So there are three Nash equilibria:
1. (A1,A1): both get 3
2. (A0,A0): both get 5
3. Mixed: each plays A0 with p = 0.6

In mixed equilibrium:
- You play A0 with p=0.6 → expected payoff = 5*0.6 = 3
- Or play A1 → get 3 → same.

So expected payoff: 3

Now, which equilibrium is more likely?

(A0,A0) has higher payoff, but requires coordination.

(A1,A1) is safer, and you get 3 with certainty.

Given that the original game has two equilibria, and the mixed one gives 3, **if you're risk-neutral**, you might expect **3** points expected.

But (A0,A0) is better — but only if you can coordinate.

In a one-shot game without communication, (A1,A1) is more robust.

So we might conservatively assume **expected payoff around 3** if you don’t sign.

But there is a risk of getting 0.

However, in game theory, we often assume a rational equilibrium.

The **highest payoff** you can guarantee is 3 (by playing A1).

If you play A0, you risk 0.

So **your safe payoff is 3**.

But if you believe coordination is possible, you might expect 5.

But since you’re trying to maximize **your** points, and you don’t know what P1 will do, you have to assume best response.

But here’s a key fact: **if you don't sign**, you have **no control** over the game's structure.

But **if you sign**, the contract becomes active **only if both sign**, so if you sign, and P1 also signs, you get the new game.

Now, under the contract:
- You play A0 (dominant strategy)
- P1 plays A0 (dominant strategy)
- Outcome: (A0,A0)
- Your payoff: **5**

And since both players are rational and know this, they will both sign → contract is active.

Even if P1 is a bit cautious, but since A0 is dominant for them too (same matrix), they have no reason not to sign, because signing lets them get 5 instead of possibly 3.

Wait: suppose P1 doesn’t sign → contract is inactive → original game.

Then P1, if rational, might play A1 to avoid risk.

But if P1 **does** sign, they get at least 5 (if both play A0), and 5 is better than 3.

So P1 has **incentive to sign** — because they get 5 (safe) instead of possible 0 or 3.

Similarly, you get 5 under contract.

So signing leads to guaranteed 5.

Without contract, you get only 3 (safe) or risk 0.

Therefore, **signing the contract leads to a higher expected payoff**.

---

### **Step 5: Final decision**

Expected payoff if you **sign**:
- Contract active (if P1 also signs, which they will, because they also get 5 — better than 3)
- Both play A0 → you get **5**

Expected payoff if you **do not sign**:
- No contract → original game
- Most likely outcome: (A1,A1) → you get 3
- Or mixed → expected 3
- Or (A0,A0) → 5, but less likely

So **maximum you can guarantee is 3**, but you might get 0.

Since you're trying to **maximize your total points**, and **you can ensure 5 by signing**, while without signing you can only **safely** get 3 (and risk 0), you should **sign**.

Moreover, **the contract makes A0 a dominant strategy**, removing uncertainty and leading to the high-payoff outcome.

Therefore, signing is **strictly better**.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

Original payoff matrix:
```
              Opponent A0    Opponent A1
My A0:           5              0
My A1:           3              3
```

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5 each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 each.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With C1, when someone plays A0, they receive +4 from the other player.

Modified payoffs:
```
              Opponent A0    Opponent A1
My A0:           5              4
My A1:          -1              3
```

Breaking down (A0, A1): I get base 0 + 4 for playing A0 = 4. Opponent gets base 3 - 4 for my A0 = -1.

**Key insight**: A0 becomes a **dominant strategy** for both players!
- If opponent plays A0, I prefer A0 (5 > -1)
- If opponent plays A1, I prefer A0 (4 > 3)

This creates a **unique Nash equilibrium** at (A0, A0) with payoff **5 for me**.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

With C2, when someone plays A1, they pay 1 to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
```
              Opponent A0    Opponent A1
My A0:           5              1
My A1:           2              3
```

Breaking down (A0, A1): I get base 0 + 1 from opponent's A1 penalty = 1.

This still has **two Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) giving 5 each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 each.

However, C2 reduces the risk of miscoordination (if I play A0 and opponent plays A1, I get 1 instead of 0).

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **C1**: Guarantees the optimal outcome of 5 by making (A0, A0) the unique equilibrium - **best option**
- **C2**: Maintains coordination problem but provides some insurance against miscoordination - **better than no contract**
- **No contract**: Coordination problem with higher miscoordination risk - **worst option**

## Step 5: Strategic voting decision

Since C1 > C2 > No Contract from my perspective, I should approve both contracts. This ensures:
- If opponent also prefers C1 (which they should, as it benefits both equally), C1 wins
- If for some reason opponent behaves unexpectedly, having C2 approved provides a safety net

response:
To maximize the total points received in this game, we analyze the payoff matrix and the players' incentives.

1.  **Payoff Analysis**:
    *   If you (Player 1) choose **A1**, you are guaranteed **3 points** regardless of Player 2's decision (A0 gives 3, A1 gives 3).
    *   If you choose **A0**, your payoff depends on Player 2: you receive **5 points** if they choose A0, but **0 points** if they choose A1.

2.  **Strategic Evaluation**:
    *   This is a coordination game with two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).
    *   (A0, A0) is "payoff-dominant," offering the highest possible reward (5 points).
    *   (A1, A1) is "risk-dominant" (or in this specific matrix, A1 acts as a security strategy), as it guarantees a consistent return of 3 points and avoids the possibility of receiving 0.

3.  **The Impact of the Twist**:
    *   Player 1 proposed a contract that would have penalized playing A1 and rewarded playing A0, effectively making A0 a dominant strategy and ensuring the (5, 5) outcome.
    *   Player 2 rejected this contract. This rejection is a significant signal; it suggests that Player 2 is either risk-averse, distrustful of the coordination, or intends to stick with the "safe" choice of A1.

4.  **Decision Reasoning**:
    *   Given that Player 2 rejected a mechanism designed to guarantee A0, the probability that Player 2 will choose A0 is low.
    *   For Player 1, A1 is a robust choice because it eliminates the risk of a 0-point outcome. Since the expected value of A0 only exceeds 3 if you believe there is a greater than 60% chance that Player 2 will choose A0, the rejection of the contract makes A1 the more rational, point-maximizing choice.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the payoff matrices both with and without the contract.

**Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, there are two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) with a payoff of (5, 5) and (A1, A1) with a payoff of (3, 3). While (A0, A0) is better for both, there is a risk; if one player attempts to play A0 and the other plays A1, the player who chose A0 receives 0 points. For risk-averse players, (A1, A1) is the "safer" choice.

**The Proposed Contract:**
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional payment is made.

**Contract Payoff Matrix:**
- **(A0, A0):** Base payoff (5, 5). Player 1 gets +4 and pays -4; Player 2 gets +4 and pays -4. Final: **(5, 5)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Base payoff (0, 3). Player 1 gets +4 (for A0); Player 2 pays -4 (to Player 1). Final: **(4, -1)**.
- **(A1, A0):** Base payoff (3, 0). Player 2 gets +4 (for A0); Player 1 pays -4 (to Player 2). Final: **(-1, 4)**.
- **(A1, A1):** Base payoff (3, 3). Neither player chooses A0. Final: **(3, 3)**.

**Analysis of the Contract Matrix:**
- **For Player 1:** If Player 2 plays A0, 5 (A0) is better than -1 (A1). If Player 2 plays A1, 4 (A0) is better than 3 (A1). Therefore, **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy** for Player 1.
- **For Player 2:** If Player 1 plays A0, 5 (A0) is better than -1 (A1). If Player 1 plays A1, 4 (A0) is better than 3 (A1). Therefore, **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy** for Player 2.

**Conclusion:**
With the contract, both players have a dominant strategy to choose A0, leading to a guaranteed payoff of 5 points each. This removes the risk of the (3, 3) or (0, 3)/(3, 0) outcomes that exist in the base game. Since the contract simplifies the coordination problem and leads to the highest possible mutual payoff of 5, it is in your best interest to sign it.

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the payoffs of the game both with and without the contract.

### 1. Base Game Analysis
The payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) for the actions A0 and A1 is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this base game:
- If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 should play A0 (5 > 3).
- If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 should play A1 (3 > 0).
This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). While (A0, A0) is the Pareto-dominant outcome (offering more points to both), (A1, A1) is often considered safer because the risk of getting 0 if a player miscoordinates is eliminated.

### 2. Contract Analysis
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

If both players sign the contract, the payoffs are adjusted:
- **(A0, A0):** 
  - Player 1: 5 (base) + 5 (for A0) - 5 (payment to P2) = 5
  - Player 2: 5 (base) + 5 (for A0) - 5 (payment to P1) = 5
- **(A0, A1):** 
  - Player 1: 0 (base) + 5 (for A0) = 5
  - Player 2: 3 (base) - 5 (payment to P1) = -2
- **(A1, A0):** 
  - Player 1: 3 (base) - 5 (payment to P2) = -2
  - Player 2: 0 (base) + 5 (for A0) = 5
- **(A1, A1):** 
  - Player 1: 3 (base) = 3
  - Player 2: 3 (base) = 3

### 3. Comparison and Strategy
With the contract active, let's look at Player 2's incentives:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 5 pts (A0) vs -2 pts (A1).
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 5 pts (A0) vs 3 pts (A1).
In the contracted game, **A0 is a dominant strategy** for Player 2. The same logic applies to Player 1. Therefore, if both sign, the outcome will certainly be (A0, A0), leading to 5 points.

Without the contract, the outcome is uncertain. While (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium, players might default to (A1, A1) to avoid the risk of getting 0 points. By signing the contract, you ensure that A0 becomes the only logical choice for both players, locking in the maximum possible payoff of 5 points.

Since Player 1 proposed the contract, it is highly likely they will sign it. Signing the contract is in Player 2's best interest to maximize their points.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy, we must analyze the modified payoff matrix resulting from the base game rules and the additional payment contract.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1.  **Understand the Base Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):**
    *   (A0, A0): (5, 5)
    *   (A0, A1): (0, 3)
    *   (A1, A0): (3, 0)
    *   (A1, A1): (3, 3)

2.  **Incorporate the Payment Contract:**
    *   If Player 1 chooses A0, they gain 4 points from Player 2.
    *   If Player 2 (you) chooses A0, you gain 4 points from Player 1.
    *   If a player chooses A1, no points are transferred for that choice.

3.  **Calculate the Adjusted Payoffs:**
    *   **Both choose A0:** 
        *   Player 1: 5 (base) + 4 (for choosing A0) - 4 (taken by Player 2) = 5
        *   Player 2: 5 (base) + 4 (for choosing A0) - 4 (taken by Player 1) = 5
    *   **Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:** 
        *   Player 1: 0 (base) + 4 (for choosing A0) = 4
        *   Player 2: 3 (base) - 4 (taken by Player 1) = -1
    *   **Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:** 
        *   Player 1: 3 (base) - 4 (taken by Player 2) = -1
        *   Player 2: 0 (base) + 4 (for choosing A0) = 4
    *   **Both choose A1:**
        *   Player 1: 3 (base)
        *   Player 2: 3 (base)

4.  **Evaluate Strategy:**
    Looking at the payoff matrix for Player 2:
    *   If Player 1 chooses A0: You get 5 for A0 and -1 for A1. (A0 is better)
    *   If Player 1 chooses A1: You get 4 for A0 and 3 for A1. (A0 is better)

Since A0 provides a higher payoff regardless of the other player's decision, it is the strictly dominant strategy.

To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the game under the original rules and then evaluate how the proposed contract changes the incentives and outcomes.

### Original Game Analysis
The original payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this version, there are two Nash Equilibria:
1.  **(A0, A0)** resulting in (5, 5): This is the best outcome for both players, but it is risky because if one player chooses A0 and the other switches to A1, the A0 player receives 0 points.
2.  **(A1, A1)** resulting in (3, 3): This is a safer but less rewarding equilibrium. If players are risk-averse, they may gravitate toward this outcome to avoid the 0-point payoff.

### Contract Analysis
The contract specifies:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there are no additional payments.

If both players sign, the new payoff matrix becomes:
- **(A0, A0)**: (5 + 4 - 4, 5 + 4 - 4) = **(5, 5)**
- **(A0, A1)**: (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = **(4, -1)**
- **(A1, A0)**: (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = **(-1, 4)**
- **(A1, A1)**: (3, 3) = **(3, 3)**

### Evaluation of the Contract
Under the contract, A0 becomes the **dominant strategy** for both players:
- For Player 1: 5 > -1 (if P2 chooses A0) and 4 > 3 (if P2 chooses A1).
- For Player 2: 5 > -1 (if P1 chooses A0) and 4 > 3 (if P1 chooses A1).

By making A0 the dominant strategy, the contract guarantees that rational players will choose A0, leading to a stable (5, 5) outcome. This eliminates the risk of ending up in the (A1, A1) equilibrium (3 points) or being punished with 0 points (original game) or -1 point (contract game) if the other player deviates. Since the objective is to maximize your own points, and 5 is the highest possible payoff, the contract is highly beneficial.

### Conclusion
Signing the contract align both players' incentives toward the Pareto optimal outcome (5, 5) and removes the risk associated with the original game's multiple equilibria.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!


Instruction:

- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

In this game, we analyze the final payoffs by combining the base game values with the additional contract payments.

**1. Analyze the Base Game Payoffs (P1, P2):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**2. Incorporate the Contract Payments:**
The contract states that if a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- **Outcome (A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives 4 points and each pays 4 points.
  - P1: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
  - P2: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
- **Outcome (A0, A1):** Only P1 chooses A0.
  - P1 receives 4 points from P2.
  - P1: 0 + 4 = 4
  - P2: 3 - 4 = -1
- **Outcome (A1, A0):** Only P2 chooses A0.
  - P2 receives 4 points from P1.
  - P1: 3 - 4 = -1
  - P2: 0 + 4 = 4
- **Outcome (A1, A1):** Neither player chooses A0. No payments are made.
  - P1: 3
  - P2: 3

**3. Determine the Final Payoff Matrix for Player 1:**
- If Player 2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 for choosing A0, and -1 for choosing A1. (A0 is better)
- If Player 2 plays A1: P1 gets 4 for choosing A0, and 3 for choosing A1. (A0 is better)

In both scenarios, choosing A0 results in a higher payoff for Player 1. Therefore, A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy**.

**4. Determine the Final Payoff Matrix for Player 2:**
Due to the symmetry of the game and the contract, A0 is also a strictly dominant strategy for Player 2. Both players, acting rationally to maximize their own points, will gravitate toward A0.

**5. Final Strategy:**
Because A0 is the dominant strategy and leads to the highest possible mutual payoff (5, 5), there is no incentive to choose A1. A 100% probability for A0 is the most logical choice.

response:
First incorporate the contract into *your* (Player 2’s) payoff:

- If **you choose A0**, you get **+5** from Player 1 (a transfer), regardless of what they do.
- If **Player 1 chooses A0**, they get **+5** from you, meaning you pay **−5**, regardless of what you do.
- If both choose A0, the transfers cancel (you pay 5 and receive 5), so net transfer is 0.

Compute your total payoffs (base + contract):

1) **P1 A0, You A0**: base 5, transfers cancel → **5**  
2) **P1 A0, You A1**: base 3, you pay 5 → **3 − 5 = −2**  
3) **P1 A1, You A0**: base 0, you receive 5 → **0 + 5 = 5**  
4) **P1 A1, You A1**: base 3, no transfer → **3**

Now compare your actions:
- If you play **A0**, you always get **5** (no matter what Player 1 does).
- If you play **A1**, you get **−2** or **3**.

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**, and the payoff-maximizing strategy is to choose A0 with probability 1.

To maximize your points in this decision-making game, we must analyze the adjusted payoffs after incorporating the payment contract.

### 1. Analysis of the Original Payoffs
The original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### 2. Analysis of the Payment Contract
The contract specifies:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points, taken from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

Let's calculate the adjusted payoffs:
- **Case (A0, A0):** 
    - Player 1: 5 (base) + 4 (for choosing A0) - 4 (because P2 chose A0) = 5
    - Player 2: 5 (base) + 4 (for choosing A0) - 4 (because P1 chose A0) = 5
    - Result: (5, 5)
- **Case (A0, A1):** 
    - Player 1: 0 (base) + 4 (for choosing A0) - 0 (because P2 chose A1) = 4
    - Player 2: 3 (base) + 0 (for choosing A1) - 4 (because P1 chose A0) = -1
    - Result: (4, -1)
- **Case (A1, A0):** 
    - Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 (for choosing A1) - 4 (because P2 chose A0) = -1
    - Player 2: 0 (base) + 4 (for choosing A0) - 0 (because P1 chose A1) = 4
    - Result: (-1, 4)
- **Case (A1, A1):** 
    - Player 1: 3 (base) + 0 (for choosing A1) - 0 (because P2 chose A1) = 3
    - Player 2: 3 (base) + 0 (for choosing A1) - 0 (because P1 chose A1) = 3
    - Result: (3, 3)

### 3. Strategy Selection
The new payoff matrix for Player 1 is:
- Against A0: A0 gives 5, A1 gives -1.
- Against A1: A0 gives 4, A1 gives 3.

In both scenarios, choosing **A0** results in a higher payoff than choosing **A1** (5 > -1 and 4 > 3). Therefore, A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy**. Regardless of whether the other player chooses A0 or A1, you will always maximize your points by choosing A0. Furthermore, (A0, A0) provides the highest possible mutual payoff (5 each), making it the most rational choice for both players.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)

The base game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from the perspective of **Player 2**, since you are Player 2):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0        | A1        |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**              | 5, 5      | 0, 3      |
| **A1**              | 3, 0      | 3, 3      |

So when:
- Both play A0 → (5, 5)
- You play A0, Opponent plays A1 → (0, 3)
- You play A1, Opponent plays A0 → (3, 0)
- Both play A1 → (3, 3)

This looks similar to a variant of a coordination game with a twist: A0 gives high payoff when coordinated, but if you're the only one choosing A0, you lose. A1 is safe and gives 3 regardless.

---

### Step 2: Introduce the contract (incentive mechanism)

The contract says:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an **additional payment of 4 points**, drawn **equally from the other players**.

Here’s the key: **the 4 extra points come from the other player** — so if you choose A0, you gain +4, and the other player loses 4.

> If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So we must **update the payoffs** to include the contract.

Let’s recalculate the **total payoff for Player 2**, including the contract.

Note: The contract applies **per player**, so **if Player 2 chooses A0**, they gain +4 (and Player 1 loses 4).  
If Player 1 chooses A0, they gain +4, and Player 2 loses 4.

So now, the **final payoff** for Player 2 depends on:
- The base payoff (from the game).
- Plus: +4 if Player 2 chose A0.
- Minus: 4 if Player 1 chose A0 (because of the contract gain from Player 1).

Wait — this is crucial: the contract says the 4 points are "drawn equally from the other players". So if **Player 1 chooses A0**, then Player 1 gains +4, and **Player 2 loses 4**.

Similarly, if **Player 2 chooses A0**, Player 2 gains +4, and Player 1 loses 4.

So the total payoff for Player 2 becomes:

> Final Payoff (Player 2) = Base Payoff (from game) + (4 if Player 2 chooses A0) - (4 if Player 1 chooses A0)

Let’s write this out for each combination.

---

### Step 3: Compute updated payoffs for Player 2

Let’s consider all four cases.

#### Case 1: Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A0
- Base payoff: 5
- Player 2 chose A0 → +4
- Player 1 chose A0 → Player 2 loses 4
- Total: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**

#### Case 2: Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1
- Base payoff: 0
- Player 2 chose A0 → +4
- Player 1 chose A1 → no deduction
- Total: 0 + 4 = **4**

#### Case 3: Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0
- Base payoff: 3
- Player 2 chose A1 → no gain
- Player 1 chose A0 → Player 2 loses 4
- Total: 3 - 4 = **-1**

#### Case 4: Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A1
- Base payoff: 3
- Player 2 chose A1 → no gain
- Player 1 chose A1 → no deduction
- Total: 3

---

### Step 4: New payoff matrix for Player 2

| P2 \ P1 | A0         | A1         |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **A0** | 5          | 4          |
| **A1** | -1         | 3          |

So now Player 2's payoffs are:

- A0 vs A0 → 5
- A0 vs A1 → 4
- A1 vs A0 → -1
- A1 vs A1 → 3

Now we can analyze this as a maximization problem.

---

### Step 5: Find optimal mixed strategy for Player 2

We assume Player 1 is also rational and will choose their strategy to maximize their own payoff.

But both players are choosing probabilities simultaneously.

Let’s denote:

- Let **p** be the probability that **Player 1** chooses A0.
- Let **q** be the probability that **Player 2** chooses A0.

We are Player 2, trying to choose **q** to maximize expected payoff, assuming Player 1 chooses **p** optimally.

But in this case, **the contract was proposed by Player 1**, and since both signed it, we must consider that **Player 1 is also acting rationally** to maximize their own payoff.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** in this game with the contract.

Let’s first compute Player 2’s expected payoff as a function of **q** and **p**.

Let $ E_2(q, p) $ be Player 2’s expected payoff.

- With probability $ p $: Player 1 plays A0 → Player 2's expected payoff is:
  - If Player 2 plays A0: 5
  - If Player 2 plays A1: -1
  - So with prob $ q $, Player 2 gets 5, with prob $ 1-q $, gets -1
  → $ q \cdot 5 + (1-q)(-1) = 5q -1 + q = 6q - 1 $

- With probability $ 1-p $: Player 1 plays A1 → Player 2’s payoff:
  - A0 → 4
  - A1 → 3
  → $ q \cdot 4 + (1-q) \cdot 3 = 4q + 3 - 3q = q + 3 $

So total expected payoff:

$$
E_2(q, p) = p(6q - 1) + (1-p)(q + 3)
$$

Let’s expand that:

$$
E_2 = p(6q - 1) + (1-p)(q + 3)
= 6pq - p + (q + 3) - p(q + 3)
= 6pq - p + q + 3 - pq - 3p
= (6pq - pq) + q + (-p -3p) + 3
= 5pq + q - 4p + 3
$$

So:
$$
E_2(q, p) = 5pq + q - 4p + 3
$$

Now, we want to find Player 2’s best response to any $ p $. But since Player 1 also chooses optimally, we seek a **Nash equilibrium**.

Player 1 has their own expected payoff to consider.

Let’s briefly compute Player 1’s expected payoff under the contract.

---

### Step 6: Compute Player 1’s payoff (for equilibrium)

Player 1’s base payoff matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0        | A1        |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0** | 5, 5      | 3, 0      |
| **A1** | 0, 3      | 3, 3      |

Now, apply the contract:

- If Player 1 chooses A0 → +4
- If Player 2 chooses A0 → Player 1 loses 4

So Player 1’s **final payoff**:

#### Case 1: P1=A0, P2=A0
- Base: 5
- P1 chose A0 → +4
- P2 chose A0 → -4
- Total: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5

#### Case 2: P1=A0, P2=A1
- Base: 3
- P1 chose A0 → +4
- P2 chose A1 → no loss
- Total: 3 + 4 = 7

#### Case 3: P1=A1, P2=A0
- Base: 0
- P1 chose A1 → no gain
- P2 chose A0 → P1 loses 4
- Total: 0 - 4 = -4

#### Case 4: P1=A1, P2=A1
- Base: 3
- P1 chose A1 → 0
- P2 chose A1 → 0
- Total: 3

So Player 1’s payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **A0** | 5        | 7        |
| **A1** | -4       | 3        |

Now, let’s find the Nash equilibrium.

Let **p** = P(P1 plays A0), **q** = P(P2 plays A0)

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If P1 plays A0: $ q \cdot 5 + (1-q) \cdot 7 = 5q + 7 - 7q = 7 - 2q $
- If P1 plays A1: $ q \cdot (-4) + (1-q) \cdot 3 = -4q + 3 - 3q = 3 - 7q $

P1 will mix only if both are equal:
$$
7 - 2q = 3 - 7q \\
7 - 3 = -7q + 2q \\
4 = -5q \Rightarrow q = -4/5
$$

Impossible — q can't be negative.

So P1 **never** mixes — we must find where P1’s best response is pure.

Compare:
- A0: 7 - 2q
- A1: 3 - 7q

Which is better?

Set $ 7 - 2q > 3 - 7q $ → $ 4 > -5q $ → $ q > -4/5 $ → always true.

Wait: $ 7 - 2q > 3 - 7q $ → $ 4 > -5q $ → $ q > -4/5 $

Since q ≥ 0, this is **always true**.

So **A0 always gives higher expected payoff than A1**, for any q ∈ [0,1].

Therefore, **Player 1 will always play A0**, regardless of what Player 2 does.

Is that right?

Let’s test:
- If q = 0 (P2 always A1): 
  - P1 A0: 7
  - P1 A1: 3 → so A0 better
- If q = 1 (P2 always A0):
  - P1 A0: 5
  - P1 A1: -4 → A0 better
- If q = 0.5: A0: 7 - 1 = 6, A1: 3 - 3.5 = -0.5 → A0 better

Yes — **A0 strictly dominates A1 for Player 1**.

Therefore, **Player 1 will always choose A0 with probability 1**.

---

### Step 7: Given Player 1 always plays A0, what is Player 2’s best response?

Now we know: Player 1 plays A0 with probability 1.

So Player 2 faces a **certain A0** from Player 1.

Player 2’s choices:

- If Player 2 chooses A0: payoff = 5 (from earlier grid: A0 vs A0 → 5)
- If Player 2 chooses A1: payoff = -1 (A1 vs A0 → -1)

So clearly, **A0 gives 5, A1 gives -1**.

So Player 2 should play **A0 with 100% probability**.

But wait — is that optimal?

Wait, what’s our goal?

Maximize **our total points**.

So yes — against A0, A0 gives 5, A1 gives -1 → so A0 is better.

Thus, Player 2 should play A0 with probability 1.

---

### Step 8: But wait — is this consistent? Is it a Nash equilibrium?

We found:
- Player 1 best response: always play A0 (dominant strategy).
- Given P1 plays A0, Player 2 best response: play A0 (since 5 > -1).

So (q=1, p=1) is a Nash equilibrium.

Now, check if Player 2 would ever want to deviate.

No — if P1 plays A0, A0 gives 5, A1 gives -1 → best to play A0.

So yes, equilibrium is: both play A0.

But let’s double-check the contract.

Wait: does the contract change everything?

Actually, yes — **Player 1 has a strictly dominant strategy to play A0**, because even though the base game might suggest coordination, the contract gives **+4 to A0 players**, and pulls from others.

So in Player 1’s payoff, A0 is always better.

Therefore, **Player 1 plays A0 always**.

Player 2, upon knowing this, should play A0 to get 5 instead of -1.

So Player 2 should go for A0 100%.

But wait — could there be a mixed strategy?

Suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability q.

Expected payoff when Player 1 plays A0 (fixed):
- E = q × 5 + (1−q) × (−1) = 5q -1 + q = 6q -1

This is increasing in q → maximum at q=1 → E=5.

So indeed, **Player 2 should play A0 with 100% probability**.

---

### Step 9: Final decision

Player 2 should choose:
- A0: 100%
- A1: 0%

But wait — let’s verify the contract again.

The contract says:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other players.

So if Player 2 chooses A0, they get +4.

But if Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 loses 4.

In the case where both choose A0:
- Player 2 gets base 5 +4 (from choosing A0) -4 (from Player 1 choosing A0) = 5 → correct.

And if Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A0 → Player 2 gets 5.

If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0 → Player 2 gets base 3 -4 = -1.

So yes, 5 > -1 → choose A0.

No reason to mix.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine the optimal strategy for maximizing points, we first calculate the effective payoff matrix by incorporating the specified basic rules and the payment contract. We play as Player 2.

**1. Analyze the Base Payoffs (P1, P2):**
- (P1: A0, P2: A0): Base = (5, 5)
- (P1: A1, P2: A0): Base = (3, 0) (From: "If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0, the other player gets 3")
- (P1: A0, P2: A1): Base = (0, 3) (From: "If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3, the other player gets 0")
- (P1: A1, P2: A1): Base = (3, 3)

**2. Incorporate the Contract Payments:**
The contract states that any player choosing **A0** receives an additional 5 points drawn from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** P1 gets +5-5=0 change; P2 gets +5-5=0 change. Final: **(5, 5)**
- **(A1, A0):** P1 is A1 (0), P2 is A0 (+5 from P1). Final: (3-5, 0+5) = **(-2, 5)**
- **(A0, A1):** P1 is A0 (+5 from P2), P2 is A1 (0). Final: (0+5, 3-5) = **(5, -2)**
- **(A1, A1):** Neither chooses A0; no payment. Final: **(3, 3)**

**3. Evaluate the Strategic Matrix (Player 1 \ Player 2):**
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (5, -2) |
| **P1: A1** | (-2, 5) | (3, 3) |

**4. Determine the Optimal Action:**
As Player 2, we compare the outcomes for choosing A0 versus A1:
- If Player 1 chooses A0, we receive 5 points with A0 versus -2 points with A1.
- If Player 1 chooses A1, we receive 5 points with A0 versus 3 points with A1.

In both scenarios, choosing **A0** results in a higher individual payoff. Action A0 is a strictly dominant strategy for both players, leading to a stable Nash Equilibrium at (A0, A0) which yields the highest possible points for both parties under these rules.

response:
To maximize your total points, we need to compare the game's outcomes with and without the contract.

### 1. Analysis of the Base Game (Without the Contract)
The payoff matrix for the base game is as follows:
- **(A0, A0):** (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** (0, 3)
- **(A1, A0):** (3, 0)
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)

In this game, there are two Nash equilibria:
1. **(A0, A0):** Both players receive 5 points.
2. **(A1, A1):** Both players receive 3 points.

However, choosing A0 is risky for Player 1. If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 receives 0 points. Conversely, playing A1 is safer because Player 1 is guaranteed 3 points regardless of Player 2's action. This risk might lead both players to settle on the lower (A1, A1) equilibrium.

### 2. Analysis of the Contract Game (With the Contract)
The contract specifies that any player choosing A0 receives 4 points from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** Each player adds 4 and subtracts 4. Net payoff: (5, 5).
- **(A0, A1):** Player 1 (A0) receives 4 from Player 2 (A1). Net payoff: (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = (4, -1).
- **(A1, A0):** Player 2 (A0) receives 4 from Player 1 (A1). Net payoff: (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = (-1, 4).
- **(A1, A1):** No additional payments. Net payoff: (3, 3).

In the contract game, we analyze Player 1's strategies:
- If Player 2 plays A0: Player 1 gets 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1).
- If Player 2 plays A1: Player 1 gets 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1).

In both cases, **A0 is now a strictly dominant strategy for Player 1.** The same logic applies to Player 2. When both players play their dominant strategy, the outcome is (5, 5).

### 3. Conclusion
The contract effectively removes the risk associated with choosing the higher-payoff action (A0). In the base game, A0 could lead to a payoff of 0, but with the contract, choosing A0 guarantees a payoff of at least 4 (even if the other player chooses A1). This makes (A0, A0) the certain outcome, leading to the maximum possible payoff of 5 points for you.

Since the contract ensures a higher and more stable payoff than the base game, signing it is the optimal decision.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

|          | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0| 5              | 0              |
| I play A1| 3              | 3              |

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

This is a coordination game with multiple Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5 points (best outcome)
- **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3 points (safe but suboptimal)
- **Mixed strategy equilibrium**: Both play A0 with probability 3/5, expected payoff = 3

The problem is coordination risk - we might fail to coordinate on the better (A0, A0) outcome.

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

If the contract is signed:
- When I choose A0: I get +4 points, other player pays -4
- When other chooses A0: They get +4 points, I pay -4

New payoff matrix:

|          | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| I play A0| 5+4-4 = **5**  | 0+4 = **4**    |
| I play A1| 3-4 = **-1**   | 3 = **3**      |

## Step 4: Analyze the strategic impact

With the contract:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > -1)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (4 > 3)

**A0 becomes my dominant strategy!** By symmetry, A0 is also the other player's dominant strategy.

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: Risk of getting only 3 points (coordination failure)
- **With contract**: Guaranteed 5 points (both players will choose A0)

## Conclusion

The contract eliminates coordination risk and ensures we both choose A0, achieving the best mutual outcome of 5 points each. Signing the contract is strictly better for me.

response:
Both proposed contracts are identical: choosing **A0** gives you **+4** paid by the other player (and choosing **A1** gives 0 transfer).

With 2 players, this changes my payoffs to:
- (A0, A0): base 5, transfers cancel → **5**
- (A0, A1): base 0 + 4 from other → **4**
- (A1, A0): base 3 − 4 paid to other → **−1**
- (A1, A1): base 3 → **3**

So under either contract, **A0 becomes strictly dominant** for me (and symmetrically for the other player), leading to the (A0, A0) outcome with payoff **5**, and it also improves my payoff in off-equilibrium cases (e.g., if they play A1, I’d prefer A0 and get 4 rather than 3).

Therefore I approve both contracts.

- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
To determine whether or not signing the contract is beneficial, let's analyze the game with and without the contract step by step.

### Without the Contract
First, let's understand the payoffs without the contract:

- If both players choose A0: Player 2 gets 5 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If both players choose A1: Player 2 gets 3 points.

From Player 2's perspective, the strategic mix based purely on payoffs suggests balancing the probability of each action to maximize the expected payoff, potentially using mixed strategies.

### With the Contract
Now, let's see how the payoffs change with the contract:

- If both players choose A0:
  - Player 2 original payoff: 5
  - Player 2 gets an additional 5 points from Player 1.
  - Player 2 loses 5 points given to Player 1.
  - Net for Player 2: \(5 + 5 - 5 = 5\)

- If Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:
  - Player 2 original payoff: 0
  - Player 2 gets an additional 5 points from Player 1.
  - Player 2 loses 0 points given to Player 1.
  - Net for Player 2: \(0 + 5 = 5\)

- If Player 2 chooses A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:
  - Player 2 original payoff: 3
  - No additional payments.
  - Net for Player 2: \(3\)

- If both players choose A1:
  - Player 2 original payoff: 3
  - No additional payments.
  - Net for Player 2: \(3\)

### Analysis
We can note the following:
1. With the contract:
   - Choosing A0 when the other player chooses A0 or A1 always results in getting 5 points.
   - Choosing A1 results in getting 3 points regardless of the other player’s action.

2. Without the contract:
   - Choosing A0 results in variable points depending on the other player’s choice (0 or 5 points).
   - Choosing A1 results in a more predictable 3 points.

Since signing the contract guarantees a better minimum payoff (5 points for choosing A0) and does not worsen the payoff when choosing A1, it is clearly advantageous to sign the contract.

### Conclusion
Player 2 should sign the contract. Here is the resulting JSON output:

```json
{"sign": true}
```

This analysis shows that signing the contract guarantees or improves Player 2's payoff in all scenarios compared to not signing it. Hence, it is beneficial to sign the contract.

response:
Both contracts create a transfer that rewards choosing **A0** (paid by the other player). With two players, that means:

- If **both choose A0**, the transfers cancel out (each pays and receives the same amount), so payoffs stay **5,5**.
- If one chooses **A0** and the other **A1**, the A0-player gains the transfer and the A1-player pays it, making **A0 strictly better** for each player regardless of what the other does.

So under **either** contract (4 or 10), **A0 becomes a dominant action** for both players, leading to the unique equilibrium **(A0, A0)** and giving me **5 points** for sure. Since both contracts implement the same equilibrium outcome for me (and neither hurts me at equilibrium), I approve both.

Base game has two pure Nash equilibria: \((A0,A0)\) giving me 5, and \((A1,A1)\) giving me 3.

**Contract C1 (Player 1 proposal)**  
- If I play **A0** I get +4 from the other player; if I play **A1** no transfer.  
Resulting payoffs for me:
- \((A0,A0)=5\)
- \((A0,A1)=4\)
- \((A1,A0)=-1\)
- \((A1,A1)=3\)

Under C1, **A0 strictly dominates A1** for me (and symmetrically for the other player), so the unique equilibrium is \((A0,A0)\) and I get **5 for sure**. I approve C1.

**Contract C2 (Player 2 proposal)**  
- If I play **A0** I get +2 from the other player; if I play **A1** I pay 2 to the other player.  
Resulting payoffs for me:
- \((A0,A0)=5\)
- \((A0,A1)=2\)
- \((A1,A0)=1\)
- \((A1,A1)=3\)

C2 still has both equilibria \((A0,A0)\) and \((A1,A1)\), so it does **not** eliminate the risk of ending up at \((A1,A1)\) with payoff 3. Also, approving C2 can only increase the chance it gets selected (e.g., via ties), which can lower my expected payoff relative to guaranteeing C1. So I do **not** approve C2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which contract(s) I, as **Player 2**, should approve to **maximize my total points** in the game.

---

### 🔷 Step 1: Understand the Base Game without Contracts

The base payoff matrix (with Player 1 as row player, Player 2 as column player):

|         | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | (5,5) | (0,3) |
| **P2 A1** | (3,0) | (3,3) |

We are playing as **Player 2**.

So for each of my choices and the opponent’s:

- If I play A0:
  - Opponent A0 → I get 5
  - Opponent A1 → I get 0
- If I play A1:
  - Opponent A0 → I get 3
  - Opponent A1 → I get 3

So no matter what the opponent does, A1 gives me **at least 3**, and A0 only gives me 5 if they cooperate.

Thus, **A1 is weakly dominant** for me because:
- When opponent plays A0: I get 3 vs 5 → worse
- When opponent plays A1: I get 3 vs 0 → better

But if I believe the opponent will play A0 with high probability, A0 might be better.

However, we don’t know the opponent’s strategy yet. But let’s think about **rational play**.

This is a classic coordination/defection game resembling a modified Prisoner's Dilemma.

But note:
- Mutual A0: (5,5) – best outcome for both
- But if I deviate from A0 when opponent plays A0, I get only 3 – so risk.
- However, if I play A0 and opponent plays A1, I get 0 – very bad.

So there is an incentive for both players to **coordinate on A0** to get 5 each. But it’s risky.

Yet, **if both players are rational and self-interested**, they might choose A1 because:

- Playing A1 guarantees 3 regardless of opponent’s choice.
- Playing A0 risks getting 0.

So **(A1, A1)** is a Nash equilibrium: neither player wants to unilaterally deviate.

(A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium? Let's check:

- If you’re playing A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 5
- But if you deviate to A1 → you get 3 → worse
- So no incentive to deviate → yes, (A0,A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

So multiple equilibria.

But since (A1,A1) gives both 3, and is safe, while (A0,A0) requires trust, many would expect (A1,A1).

But if we can **influence behavior through contracts**, that changes things.

---

### 🔷 Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism

There are two proposed contracts:

#### ✅ Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1):
> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, **drawn equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So if **you choose A0**, you get +5, but **this 5 is taken equally from the other player**.

That means:
- For each player playing A0: receive +5
- But each gets 5 from the *other* person? Wait — “drawn equally from the other players” → plural.

Let’s interpret carefully:

> “If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.”

So suppose **I (Player 2)** play A0 → I get +5, and it comes from **the other player (Player 1)**.

So Player 1 loses 5.

Similarly, if **Player 1** plays A0 → he gets +5, and it’s taken from **me (Player 2)**.

So net effect:

- If **both** play A0 → I gain 5 (from P1), P1 gains 5 (from me). But wait — can that happen?

Wait — “drawn equally from the other players” — plural → implies if more than one other player, but here there’s only one other.

So likely: each A0 choice results in the player getting +5, paid by the *other* player.

So:
- My A0: I get +5, Player 1 loses 5
- His A0: He gets +5, I lose 5

So if both pick A0: I get +5 (from him), but I also give +5 to him → net change in my points: 5 - 5 = 0? So original 5 → still 5?

Wait — no. This is not additive linearly.

Wait — let’s clarify: the **additional payment** is separate from the base payoff.

So total payoff becomes:

> Base payoff (from original game) + bonus from contract

So if P2 plays A0, P2 gets +5 (from P1), and P1 gets -5 (since the 5 is drawn from him)

Similarly, if P1 plays A0, P1 gets +5 (from P2), P2 gets -5

So **if both play A0**:
- Base payoff: (5,5)
- Contract: P2 gets +5, P1 gets +5 → but **where do these come from?**
  - P2's +5 comes from P1 → P1 loses 5
  - P1's +5 comes from P2 → P2 loses 5
- So net: both lose 5 in contract → total payoff = 5 - 5 = 0 for each?

Wait — that can't be right.

Ah! There’s ambiguity in how "drawn equally from the other players" works.

Let me parse it again:

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So when **a player** chooses A0, they get +5, and that money is **taken from the others** — **equally**.

Since there is only one other player, then:
- When P2 chooses A0 → P2 gets +5, P1 loses 5
- When P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +5, P2 loses 5

So it's **per-player**. If both choose A0:
- P2 gets +5 (from P1)
- P1 gets +5 (from P2)
- But then P2 has paid 5 to P1, and received 5 from P1 → net zero change from contract?
Wait — no:

Actually, the **payment is made directly**: whenever someone picks A0, they get +5, and that 5 comes from **each other player**?

Wait — “drawn equally from the other players” — plural.

So if **two** players, and one plays A0, the 5 is drawn **equally** from the other players → so each other player contributes half?

But there’s only one other player.

So maybe: the 5 is drawn entirely from the **other player**, since there’s only one.

So logic:
- If P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +5, P1 loses 5
- If P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +5, P2 loses 5

So if **both** play A0:
- P2 gets +5 (from P1), but also loses 5 (because P1 played A0) → net contract payout: 0
- Similarly P1: gets +5 from P2, loses 5 to P2 → net 0
- So total payoffs remain (5,5)

But if only one plays A0:

- P2 plays A0, P1 plays A1:
  - P2 gets +5 (from P1), P1 loses 5
  - Base payoff: P2 gets 0, so total: 0 + 5 = 5
  - P1 gets 3, minus 5 = -2
- P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets +5 (from P2), P2 loses 5
  - Base: P2 gets 3, now 3 - 5 = -2
  - P1 gets 3 + 5 = 8

This seems messy.

But **important:** if **you** play A0, you get +5 **from the other player**, regardless of their action.

So contract payouts depend only on **your own choice**, not theirs.

Let’s summarize the **modified total payoff** under **C1**:

| My action | Opponent action | Base payoff | Contract bonus | Final total |
|----------|------------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| A0       | A0               | 5            | +5 (from P1)     | 10          |
| A0       | A1               | 0            | +5 (from P1)     | 5           |
| A1       | A0               | 3            | -5 (to P1)       | -2          |
| A1       | A1               | 3            | 0                | 3           |

Wait! If I play A1 and P1 plays A0, then:
- Because P1 played A0 → P1 gets +5 (from me) → so **I lose 5**
- So my final total = 3 (base) - 5 = -2

This is key.

So under C1, **my choices affect the cost/benefit based solely on others’ actions via their A0 choices**.

Let’s reframe: the contract adds a **transfer**:

- Whenever a player chooses A0, they get +5, and **their counterpart pays them 5**.
- That is: if I play A0 → I get +5 from opponent
- If opponent plays A0 → I pay 5 to them

So my net contract payoff = 5 × (I played A0) - 5 × (Opponent played A0)

Therefore, final total payoff:

**Total = Base payoff + 5×(I played A0) - 5×(P1 played A0)**

Now plug in:

| My | P1 | Base | Contract | Total |
|----|----|------|----------|-------|
| A0 | A0 | 5    | +5 -5 = 0 | 5   |
| A0 | A1 | 0    | +5 - 0 = 5 | 5 |
| A1 | A0 | 3    | 0 -5 = -5 | -2 |
| A1 | A1 | 3    | 0 - 0 = 0 | 3 |

So final payoffs under C1:
- (A0,A0): (5,5)
- (A0,A1): (5, -2)
- (A1,A0): (-2,5)
- (A1,A1): (3,3)

Note: Both players get the same contract effects.

So under C1, if **we coordinate on A0**, payoffs remain (5,5) — but now even if I play A0 alone, I still get 5, but opponent suffers.

Now, think from my POV as Player 2.

My **best response** depends on P1’s strategy.

But crucially: **playing A0 with C1 gives me guaranteed minimum 5 if they play A1**, and **only risks loss if they play A0**.

Wait:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - My options:
    - Play A0: get 5
    - Play A1: get -2 → worse
  → so I prefer A0

- If P1 plays A1:
  - My options:
    - Play A0: get 5
    - Play A1: get 3 → still better to play A0

So **in every case, A0 gives me 5 or more, A1 gives me 3 or -2**

So **A0 is strictly dominant** for me under C1!

Because:
- Against A0 → A0 gives 5 > -2 (A1)
- Against A1 → A0 gives 5 > 3 (A1)

Therefore, **under C1, I have strong incentive to play A0**, regardless of opponent.

So **C1 induces mutual A0**.

Then, if both play A0, total payoff is (5,5), which matches original.

But **under C1**, I **can't get lower than 5 if I play A0**, and **A1 risks going negative**.

So **C1 strongly incentivizes cooperation**.

Now, consider **C2**:

#### ❌ Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2):
> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payments
> - If a player chooses A1: no additional payments

So **no contract payments at all**.

So **game reverts to original payoff matrix**.

No change.

So my best strategies remain based on original game.

As before:
- A0 gives 5 if P1 plays A0, 0 if P1 plays A1
- A1 gives 3 no matter what

So A1 dominates A0 if I am risk-averse.

But if I believe P1 will play A0 (e.g., if they are cooperative), then I might want to play A0.

But under uncertainty, **A1 is safer**.

But under C1, we’ve seen that **A0 becomes strictly dominant** — a huge improvement.

Now, we must consider: **which contract should I approve?**

Approval process:
- Each contract can be approved or rejected.
- The contract with **maximum approvals** wins.
- If multiple reach max approvals, one is chosen uniformly at random.

I want to **maximize expected points**.

But I can’t control which contract wins — only whether I approve it.

So I need to **approve contracts that are good for me**, given the selection mechanism.

So my goal: **approve only those contracts that, if they win, maximize my expected payoff**.

But since I don’t know who else will approve, I must assume rational players.

But here’s the twist: **approval voting** for contract selection.

So what will happen?

Let’s suppose **all players act rationally to maximize their own outcomes**.

So let’s analyze:

---

### 🔷 Step 3: Rational Approval Strategy

Who proposes what?

- C1: proposed by **Player 1**
- C2: proposed by **Player 2**

But I (Player 2) get to decide whether to approve C1 and/or C2.

Now, C1 benefits **everyone who plays A0** — including me.

Under C1, I am **strongly incentivized to play A0**, and if both play A0, we both get 5 — same as before.

But also, under C1, **even if the other doesn’t play A0, I get 5 by playing A0**, while otherwise I’d get 3 or 0.

And importantly, **C1 removes the downside of playing A0** when the other plays A1 — in original game, A0 vs A1 gives me 0, but under C1 it gives me 5.

So **C1 dramatically improves my incentives to cooperate**.

In contrast, **C2 does nothing** — same as original game.

So from my POV as Player 2:
- **C1 is better than C2**, because it gives me higher payoffs in more scenarios.
- Under C1: my best response is always A0 → leads to (5,5) outcome.
- Under C2: if I play A0 blindly, I risk getting 0; so I may end up playing A1 → (3,3) → less than mutual A0.
- But **if C2 wins**, we just play original game → likely (A1,A1) → 3 each

Whereas under C1, even if the other player is selfish, I’m **still better off playing A0**.

So **C1 gives me a stronger guarantee of 5** (via strategic dominance), while C2 gives me only 3 at best.

Therefore, **I should definitely approve C1**.

What about **C2**?

C2 does nothing — it’s equivalent to no contract.

But if **C1 is approved**, and C2 is also approved, the system selects a contract uniformly at random among those with maximum approvals.

Suppose I approve C1, but **Player 1 also approves C1** (likely, since they proposed it).

Suppose I reject C2.

Then approvals:
- C1: 2 approvals (P1 and P2) → highest
- C2: 1 (if P1 approves it) or 0?

But we don’t know what Player 1 approves.

But crucially, **I can’t influence Player 1’s approval**.

But I *can* choose mine.

Now, if I **approve both C1 and C2**, then:
- Suppose C1 gets 2 approvals, C2 gets possibly 2 (if P1 also approves it) or 1
- Then maximum approvals is 2 → both C1 and C2 could be selected (if tied)

But selection is uniform at random from maximum-approval contracts.

So if both have 2 approvals → each has 50% chance to be selected.

Then expected payoff = 0.5 * (payoff under C1) + 0.5 * (payoff under C2)

From above:
- Payoff under C1: if contract is accepted, I play A0 → get 5
- Payoff under C2: if contract is accepted, likely A1,A1 → I get 3

So expected payoff = 0.5*5 + 0.5*3 = 2.5 + 1.5 = **4**

But if I **only approve C1**, and P1 approves it → C1 gets 2 approvals, C2 gets 1 or 0 → C1 wins for sure → I get 5

→ **expected payoff = 5**

Which is better than 4.

Now, what if I **only approve C2**, and reject C1?

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (P1), probably
- C2: 1 approval (me), maybe more

Then C2 might win → I get 3

Or if C1 gets 2 (P1 + ?, not me), then C1 wins → I get 5

But since I don’t approve C1, I reduce its chances.

But crucially, **if I reject C1**, then C1 can only win if P1 and some others approve it — but if I reject, and P1 approves it, C1 has at most 1 extra approval.

So C1 might not win — instead, C2 might win → I get 3.

Alternatively, C1 might still win if others approve it.

But since I’m trying to **maximize my own payoff**, I should try to **favor contracts that benefit me the most**, assuming they can win.

But here’s the key: **by approving C1, I ensure it has one more approval.**

Moreover, **C1 gives me a higher payoff in the resulting outcome than C2 does.**

So:

- Approving C1 increases the chance that C1 wins — and I prefer C1 (gives me 5) over C2 (gives me 3).
- Approving C2 **does not help me** — it's worse than C1.
- And by approving C2, I increase the number of contracts with high approvals, possibly making **tie** between C1 and C2 → then I face 50% chance of getting 3 instead of 5 → expected gain drops from 5 to 4.

So **approving C2 reduces my expected payoff**, unless I’m certain that C1 won’t win anyway.

But I cannot be certain.

Therefore, **rationally, I should only approve contracts that are beneficial to me**, and avoid diluting the approval count for better contracts.

In particular: by approving **only C1**, I:
- Increase the likelihood that C1 wins
- Avoid creating a tie that allows worse contract C2 to win sometimes

Hence, to maximize my expected payoff, I should:
- **Approve C1 (yes)**
- **Reject C2 (no)**

Even though C2 is neutral (no cost, no benefit), it is **worse for me than C1**, and increases the risk of getting a worse outcome.

Thus, **optimal approval decision**: approve only C1.

---

### 📌 Final Reasoning Summary:

- **C1** makes playing A0 strictly dominant for me → ensures mutual A0 → I get 5
- **C2** does nothing → original game → likely (A1,A1) → I get only 3
- By approving C1, I boost its chance of success
- By approving C2, I reduce my expected payoff (risk of 50% chance of 3 instead of 100% chance of 5)
- Therefore, I should **approve C1, reject C2**

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 1, we must first analyze how the contract modifies the original payoff matrix. 

### Step 1: Analyze the Payoff Matrix with the Contract
The original payoffs (Player 1, Player 2) are:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

The contract states that any player choosing **A0** receives 4 points from the other player.
- **Both Choose A0:**
  - Player 1: 5 (base) + 4 (bonus for choosing A0) - 4 (taken by Player 2 for choosing A0) = 5
  - Player 2: 5 (base) + 4 (bonus for choosing A0) - 4 (taken by Player 1 for choosing A0) = 5
  - Result: **(5, 5)**
- **Player 1 Choose A0, Player 2 Choose A1:**
  - Player 1: 0 (base) + 4 (bonus for choosing A0) = 4
  - Player 2: 3 (base) - 4 (taken by Player 1 for choosing A0) = -1
  - Result: **(4, -1)**
- **Player 1 Choose A1, Player 2 Choose A0:**
  - Player 1: 3 (base) - 4 (taken by Player 2 for choosing A0) = -1
  - Player 2: 0 (base) + 4 (bonus for choosing A0) = 4
  - Result: **(-1, 4)**
- **Both Choose A1:**
  - Player 1: 3 (base) = 3
  - Player 2: 3 (base) = 3
  - Result: **(3, 3)**

### Step 2: Determine the Optimal Strategy
Now we evaluate the modified payoff matrix:
- **If Player 2 chooses A0:** Player 1 gets **5** by choosing A0 and **-1** by choosing A1.
- **If Player 2 chooses A1:** Player 1 gets **4** by choosing A0 and **3** by choosing A1.

In both scenarios, choosing **A0** yields a higher payoff for Player 1 regardless of Player 2’s decision (5 > -1 and 4 > 3). Therefore, **A0** is a strictly dominant strategy.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Player 1's objective is to maximize their own total points, and A0 is mathematically superior under all conditions in the modified game, the optimal strategy is to allocate 100% probability to A0.

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!


Instruction:
- Choose a probability distribution over the provided actions each round.
- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

To optimize our approach in this decision-making game, we need to consider both the basic game rules and the additional payment contract. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the situation:

1. **Basic Game Rules Payoffs**:
    - If both players choose A0: You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
    - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
    - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
    - If both players choose A1: Both get 3 points.

2. **Additional Payment Contract**:
    - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 5 points, which is deducted from the other player.
    - For A1, there are no additional payments.

### Calculating Effective Payoffs:

- **If both choose A0**: We get 5 points from the game + 5 points from the contract, resulting in 10 points each.
- **If we choose A0 and the other chooses A1**: We get 0 points from the game, but since we chose A0, we receive 5 points from the other player, totaling 5 points for us, and the other player gets 3 points.
- **If we choose A1 and the other chooses A0**: We get 3 points from the game. The other player gets 0 points, but they get 5 points from the contract, thus they get 5 points and we end with 3 points.
- **If both choose A1**: Both get 3 points from the game, and with no additional payments, our total is 3 points each.

Given these calculations, the expected payoffs can be summarized:

| Us / Them | A0  | A1  |
|:---------:|-----|-----|
| A0        | 10  | 5   |
| A1        | 3   | 3   |

### Strategy and Decision-Making:

Given the payoffs, let's analyze the possibilities:

1. **Both choosing A0 (A0,A0)** yields the maximum points: 10 each.
2. **Choosing A0 when the other chooses A1 (A0,A1)** results in us getting 5 points and the other getting 3 points.
3. **Choosing A1 when the other chooses A0 (A1,A0)** results in us getting 3 points and the other getting 5 points.
4. **Both choosing A1 (A1,A1)** leads to 3 points each.

To maximize our score, cooperating by choosing A0 is most beneficial if the other player also considers this strategy. However, if cooperation can't be presumed and risk is involved, we may need to hedge our choices. 

Since the best outcome for both (assuming rational behavior and mutual cooperation) is A0, there is a strong incentive to choose it to reach an equilibrium where both players maximize their points. Rational players would recognize this, and typically cooperate in such setting.

### Final Decision:

Given the considerations of maximum points and potential rationality and cooperation, we will adopt the strategy of choosing A0 predominantly, with perhaps a slight consideration for A1 just in case.

```json
{"A0": 90, "A1": 10}
```

This mix leans strongly towards cooperation to capture the highest reward but injects some conservative hedge in case the other player intends to defect significantly.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoffs with the contract

The contract states: if a player chooses A0, they get +4 points from the other player.

**Modified payoff matrix (My payoff, Other's payoff):**
- (A0, A0): I get 5 + 4 - 4 = 5, Other gets 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 4 = 4, Other gets 3 - 4 = -1  
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 4 = -1, Other gets 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1, A1): I get 3, Other gets 3

## Step 2: Analyze my best strategy

Let me check if A0 dominates A1 by comparing my payoffs:

**If the other player plays A0:**
- I choose A0: I get 5 points
- I choose A1: I get -1 points
- A0 is better (5 > -1)

**If the other player plays A1:**
- I choose A0: I get 4 points
- I choose A1: I get 3 points  
- A0 is better (4 > 3)

A0 gives me strictly higher payoffs regardless of what the other player does!

## Step 3: Verify with expected payoff

If the other player chooses A0 with probability q:
- My expected payoff = 5q + 4(1-q) if I play A0
- My expected payoff = -1q + 3(1-q) if I play A1

For A0: E(A0) = 5q + 4 - 4q = q + 4
For A1: E(A1) = -q + 3 - 3q = -4q + 3

E(A0) - E(A1) = (q + 4) - (-4q + 3) = 5q + 1

Since q ∈ [0,1], we have 5q + 1 ≥ 1 > 0, so A0 always gives higher expected payoff.

## Conclusion

A0 is a strictly dominant strategy. I should play it with 100% probability.

First, incorporate the contract into *your* payoff:

- If you choose **A0**, you get **+4** points taken from the other player.
- If the other player chooses **A0**, they get **+4** points taken from you (so you effectively get **−4**).

So your effective payoffs become:

- (A0, A0): base 5, plus +4, minus 4 = **5**
- (A0, A1): base 0, plus +4 = **4**
- (A1, A0): base 3, minus 4 = **−1**
- (A1, A1): base 3 = **3**

Now compare your actions against each possible opponent action:

- If opponent plays **A0**: A0 gives **5**, A1 gives **−1** → **A0 is better**
- If opponent plays **A1**: A0 gives **4**, A1 gives **3** → **A0 is better**

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**, meaning your best strategy is to play **A0 with 100% probability**.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:

Contract proposed by Player 2:

Let's analyze the situation to determine the optimal decisions:

### Original Game Payoff Matrix:
```
                Player 2
              A0         A1
Player 1
A0         (5, 5)    (0, 3)
A1         (3, 0)    (3, 3)
```

### Contract Analysis

1. **Contract proposed by Player 1:**
   - If a player chooses A0: 
     - They receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1:
     - There is no additional payment in either direction.

   **Modified Payoff Matrix under Player 1's Contract:**
   ```
                   Player 2
                 A0          A1
   Player 1
   A0        (1, 9)    (-4, 7)
   A1        (7, 1)    (3, 3)
   ```

   Explanation:
   - (A0, A0): Each player gets 5 points, but then each player gets additional 4 points from the other player's points. So the total becomes (1, 9) for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.
   - (A0, A1): Player 1's points are 0 minus 4 (since the 4 points go to Player 2), and Player 2's points are 3 plus 4.
   - (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3 points plus 4 points taken from Player 2, and Player 2 gets 0 minus 4.
   - (A1, A1): No payment changes, remains (3, 3).

2. **Contract proposed by Player 2:**
   - If a player chooses A0:
     - They receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1:
     - They pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other player.

   **Modified Payoff Matrix under Player 2's Contract:**
   ```
                   Player 2
                 A0         A1
   Player 1
   A0        (4, 6)    (-1, 4)
   A1        (4, 2)    (4, 4)
   ```

   Explanation:
   - (A0, A0): Each player gets 5 points plus or minus 1 point. So, (4, 6).
   - (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0 minus 1, and Player 2 gets 3 plus 1.
   - (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3 minus 1, and Player 2 gets 0 plus 1.
   - (A1, A1): Each player gets 3, minus 1, results (4, 4).

### Approval Decision

- **Player 1's Contract** is significantly more beneficial for Player 2 than for Player 1, because the points' shift favors Player 2’s choices more strongly.

- **Player 2's Contract** adjusts payoffs slightly in favor of more points for Player 2's selections; however, Player 1’s response might render the game less optimal distribution going. 

**Final Approval Decision:**
- Approve Player 1's contract (since it hugely benefits you compared to the other player).
- Approve your own contract (as the fairness suggests approving if put forth).

Here is the JSON format to return:
```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": true
}
```

It's rational to approve both in a nuanced game theory to keep the option open and push for the best possible outcomes, drawing a random winner with approval might land on higher gains.

Adjust the payoffs to include the contract transfer:

- If you (Player 2) choose **A0**, you receive **+4** taken from Player 1.
- If Player 1 chooses **A0**, you lose **4** (paid to Player 1).
- If both choose **A0**, the transfers cancel (each pays 4 and receives 4), so net transfer is 0.

So your (Player 2) payoffs become:

- (P1 A0, P2 A0): original 5, net transfer 0 → **5**
- (P1 A0, P2 A1): original 3, you pay 4 → **-1**
- (P1 A1, P2 A0): original 0, you receive 4 → **4**
- (P1 A1, P2 A1): original 3, no transfer → **3**

Compare your actions:
- If you play **A0**: you get **5** vs P1 A0, **4** vs P1 A1
- If you play **A1**: you get **-1** vs P1 A0, **3** vs P1 A1

**A0 strictly dominates A1**, so the best strategy is to play A0 with probability 100%.

To determine whether to sign the contract, we must first analyze the original game's payoffs and then see how the contract alters the incentives for both players.

### 1. Original Game Analysis
The original payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) based on the description is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Player 2's considerations:**
- If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets **5** by choosing A0 or **3** by choosing A1. (A0 is better)
- If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets **0** by choosing A0 or **3** by choosing A1. (A1 is better)

This is a coordination game (specifically a version of the Stag Hunt). While (A0, A0) is the most beneficial outcome (giving 5 points each), (A1, A1) is a safer Nash equilibrium because choosing A1 guarantees 3 points regardless of what the other player does. If Player 2 is uncertain about Player 1's behavior, they might choose the "safe" action A1, resulting in only 3 points.

### 2. Contract Analysis
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they get +4 points, and the other player loses 4 points.
- If both choose A0, these payments cancel out (5 + 4 - 4 = 5).

**Revised Payoff Matrix with Contract:**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = (4, -1)
- (A1, A0): (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = (-1, 4)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Player 2's considerations in the contract game:**
- If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 gets **5** (A0) or **-1** (A1).
- If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 gets **4** (A0) or **3** (A1).

In the contract game, action A0 becomes a dominant strategy for Player 2 because it yields a higher payoff than A1 regardless of Player 1's choice (5 > -1 and 4 > 3). Similarly, A0 becomes a dominant strategy for Player 1.

### 3. Comparison and Conclusion
- **Without the contract:** Players are likely to gravitate toward A1 to avoid the risk of getting 0 points, resulting in 3 points each.
- **With the contract:** A0 becomes the dominant strategy, guaranteeing that both rational players will choose A0 and receive 5 points each.

The contract removes the risk associated with choosing the high-payoff action (A0) and ensures the maximum possible payoff (5 points). Therefore, signing the contract is the optimal decision to maximize total points.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
- (My A0, Other A0): I get 5, other gets 5
- (My A0, Other A1): I get 0, other gets 3  
- (My A1, Other A0): I get 3, other gets 0
- (My A1, Other A1): I get 3, other gets 3

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving both players 5, and (A1, A1) giving both players 3.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1

With Contract 1 (A0 gives +5, taken from the other player):
- (A0, A0): I get 5+5-5 = 5, other gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0+5 = 5, other gets 3-5 = -2
- (A1, A0): I get 3-5 = -2, other gets 0+5 = 5  
- (A1, A1): I get 3, other gets 3

Now A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players! No matter what the other player does, A0 is always better.

**Result: Unique Nash equilibrium at (A0, A0) with payoff 5 for both players.**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2

With Contract 2 (A1 costs -1 paid to the other player):
- (A0, A0): I get 5, other gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0+1 = 1, other gets 3-1 = 2
- (A1, A0): I get 3-1 = 2, other gets 0+1 = 1
- (A1, A1): I get 3-1+1 = 3, other gets 3

This still has two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5 each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 each. The coordination problem remains.

## Step 4: Compare Outcomes

- **Contract 1**: Guarantees the best outcome (5 points) by making it the unique equilibrium
- **Contract 2**: Maintains the same coordination problem as the base game, doesn't guarantee the good outcome
- **No Contract**: Same coordination problem as Contract 2

## Step 5: Decision

Contract 1 is clearly superior - it eliminates coordination risk and guarantees both players get the maximum payoff of 5. Since the game is symmetric, Player 1 should also strongly prefer Contract 1.

Contract 2 doesn't meaningfully improve upon the base game and could lead to a worse outcome if it wins instead of Contract 1.

Therefore, I should approve only Contract 1.

response:
To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the basic payoff matrix and then adjust it according to the contract.

**Step 1: Analyze the basic payoff matrix (P1, P2)**
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

**Step 2: Incorporate the contract**
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, no additional points are exchanged.

Recalculating the payoffs:
- **Case (A0, A0):** Both receive 4 points and both pay 4 points. The net change is 0.
  Payoff: (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = (5, 5)
- **Case (A0, A1):** Player 1 receives 4 points from Player 2.
  Payoff: (0+4, 3-4) = (4, -1)
- **Case (A1, A0):** Player 2 receives 4 points from Player 1.
  Payoff: (3-4, 0+4) = (-1, 4)
- **Case (A1, A1):** No additional points are exchanged.
  Payoff: (3, 3)

**Step 3: Analyze the new payoff matrix**
| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A0** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **A1** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

**Step 4: Determine the optimal strategy**
Looking at the payoffs for Player 1:
- If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 5 for A0 and -1 for A1. (A0 is better)
- If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 4 for A0 and 3 for A1. (A0 is better)

Regardless of Player 2's decision, choosing A0 always yields a higher payoff for Player 1 than choosing A1. Thus, A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy**. Furthermore, (A0, A0) results in the highest possible payoff for both players (5 points each), making it the most rational and beneficial choice.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to choose A0 with 100% probability.

### Step-by-step reasoning

1. **Baseline game (Contract C2: no payments)**
   - Payoffs:
     - (A0,A0) = (5,5)
     - (A1,A1) = (3,3)
     - (A0,A1) = (0,3)
     - (A1,A0) = (3,0)
   - This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria: **(A0,A0)** and **(A1,A1)**. So without a contract, there’s a real risk the players coordinate on the lower-payoff equilibrium (A1,A1).

2. **Contract C1 effects**
   - Rule: If you play **A0**, you **receive +4** from the other player. If the other player plays **A0**, you **pay 4** to them. (No transfers for A1.)
   - Player 1 payoffs become:
     - (A0,A0): \(5 + 4 - 4 = 5\)
     - (A0,A1): \(0 + 4 - 0 = 4\)
     - (A1,A0): \(3 + 0 - 4 = -1\)
     - (A1,A1): \(3\)
   - Now, for Player 1:
     - If Player 2 plays A0: A0 yields 5 vs A1 yields -1 ⇒ **A0 is better**
     - If Player 2 plays A1: A0 yields 4 vs A1 yields 3 ⇒ **A0 is better**
   - So under C1, **A0 is strictly dominant** for both players, making **(A0,A0)** the unique outcome, giving you **5** for sure.

3. **Approval strategy**
   - Approving **C2** can only make it easier for C2 to be selected (e.g., if both approve it), which reintroduces coordination risk.
   - Approving only **C1** maximizes the chance C1 is selected and never helps C2 win.

### Step-by-step reasoning

1. **Baseline game** has two pure equilibria:  
   - (A0, A0) gives you **5**  
   - (A1, A1) gives you **3**  
   So you prefer outcomes that make **A0** more likely / dominant.

2. **Contract C1 (Player 1 proposal)**: choosing **A0** gives +4 taken from the other player.
   - Payoffs become (for you):  
     - (A0,A0): 5 (transfers cancel)  
     - (A0,A1): 4  
     - (A1,A0): -1  
     - (A1,A1): 3  
   - Here **A0 strictly dominates A1** (better regardless of what the other does).  
   - So the unique equilibrium is **(A0, A0)** and you get **5 for sure**.

3. **Contract C2 (Player 2 proposal)**: choosing **A0** gives +1 from the other; choosing **A1** pays -1 to the other.
   - Payoffs become (for you):  
     - (A0,A0): 5  
     - (A0,A1): 1  
     - (A1,A0): 2  
     - (A1,A1): 3  
   - This still has **two equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1). Since coordination can fail, C2 can lead to worse outcomes than C1.

4. **Voting implication**: Approving C2 can only increase the chance it gets selected (possibly via a tie), which risks lowering your expected payoff compared with the guaranteed-good C1.

### Step 1: Analyze incentives under each contract

#### No contract (baseline, for reference)
- Best responses create two pure equilibria: **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)**, plus a mixed equilibrium.
- So coordination is an issue.

---

### Contract C1 (Player 1’s proposal)
Rule: If you play **A0**, you receive **+4** from the other player (2 players → you get 4 directly from them).

Resulting payoffs for Player 1:
- (A0, A0): \(5 +4-4 = 5\)
- (A0, A1): \(0 +4 = 4\)
- (A1, A0): \(3 -4 = -1\)
- (A1, A1): \(3\)

So for Player 1:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives -1 → **A0 better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3 → **A0 better**

Therefore **A0 strictly dominates A1**, and the unique equilibrium becomes **(A0, A0)** with payoff **5** to you.

Conclusion: **C1 is very good for you. Approve.**

---

### Contract C2 (Player 2’s proposal)
Rule: If you play **A1**, you **pay 1** to the other player.

Resulting payoffs for Player 1:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): \(0 +1 = 1\)
- (A1, A0): \(3 -1 = 2\)
- (A1, A1): \(3\)

This still has two equilibria: **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)** (coordination problem remains), and it can even make mixed play worse.

Conclusion: **C2 is not beneficial relative to ensuring C1 is selected. Disapprove.**

---

### Step 2: Voting strategy
If you approve C2, you increase the chance it gets selected (especially if Player 2 approves it), which can replace the clearly favorable C1.

So the best vote is: **approve only C1**.

{"C1": true, "C2": false}

### Step-by-step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Original Game Payoffs**:
   - If both players choose A0: both get 5 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and I choose A1: Player 1 gets 3 points, I get 0 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and I choose A0: Player 1 gets 0 points, I get 3 points.
   - If both players choose A1: both get 3 points.

2. **Analyzing the Proposed Contract**:
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional 4 points, taken from the other player.
       - This means the net effect of choosing A0 under the contract would be a gain of 4 points and the other player would lose 4 points.
   
3. **Calculating the New Payoffs with Signed Contract** (assuming both players sign):
   - If both players choose A0:
     - Without the contract: Player 1: 5, Player 2: 5
     - With the contract: Player 1: 9 (5 + 4), Player 2: 9 (5 + 4)

   - If Player 1 chooses A0 and I choose A1:
     - Without the contract: Player 1: 3, Player 2: 0
     - With the contract: Player 1: 7 (3 + 4), Player 2: -4 (0 - 4)

   - If Player 1 chooses A1 and I choose A0:
     - Without the contract: Player 1: 0, Player 2: 3
     - With the contract: Player 1: -4 (0 - 4), Player 2: 7 (3 + 4)

   - If both players choose A1:
     - Without the contract: Player 1: 3, Player 2: 3
     - With the contract: Player 1: 3, Player 2: 3

4. **Considering the Strategy and Rational Decision**:
   - When both players choose A0, both benefit equally more due to the contract.
   - Choosing A1 under the contract results in potentially higher variability and more significant losses if the opponent chooses A0. This can be seen in the case where Player 1  chooses A0 and I choose A1 leading to a loss.
   - As Player 2, I would prefer the situation to be mutually favorable and symmetric over one with large losses/gains variance.

5. **Decision**:
   - Given that the contract strongly encourages the symmetric choice of both players choosing A0 for the maximum shared benefit and the symmetry of this benefit, it would likely improve trust and predictability in both players sticking with A0. This overall maximizes points sustainably.

### Conclusion
- Signing the contract should be strategically sound in order to move towards maximum mutual gains in simpler and more predictable optimal setup payoffs.

response:
To address this decision-making game effectively, we need to carefully analyze both the payoff matrix provided and the additional points from the contract.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. Payoff Matrix:
Given the basic payoffs:
- (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 5 points, Player 1 gets 5 points.
- (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
- (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- (A1, A1): Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.

#### 2. Contract Impact:
With the contract:
If a player chooses A0, they gain an additional 4 points from the other player.
- (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 9 points (5 + 4), Player 1 gets 1 point (5 - 4).
- (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 4 points (0 + 4), Player 1 gets -1 point (3 - 4).
- (A1, A0): Player 2 gets -1 point (3 - 4), Player 1 gets 7 points (0 + 4).
- (A1, A1): Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 3 points (no change).

#### Expected Payoff Calculation:

Let \(p\) be the probability that Player 1 chooses A0, then (1 - p) is the probability Player 1 chooses A1. Let \(q\) be the probability that Player 2 chooses A0, then (1 - q) is the probability that Player 2 chooses A1.

For Player 2's expected payoffs:

- Choosing A0:
\[ E(A0) = 9p + 4(1 - p) = 9p + 4 - 4p = 5p + 4 \]

- Choosing A1:
\[ E(A1) = -1p + 3(1 - p) = -p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 4p \]

We need to find the equilibrium by comparing the expected payoffs. Set the expected payoffs for A0 and A1 equal to each other:

\[ 5p + 4 = 3 - 4p \]
\[ 9p = -1 \]
\[ p = -\frac{1}{9} \]

Since probabilities must be between 0 and 1, our initial calculation seems inconsistent. In equilibrium scenarios, we need to find the probability \(q\) for Player 2 where Player 2 maximizes their expected payoff given Player 1's mixed strategy, and vice versa.

Given these incentives, we should estimate the strategy by comparing the values directly:

#### 3. Strategy Recommendation:
Evaluating qualitatively:
- If Player 1 generally prefers A0 (as it gives an overall higher reward), Player 2 would be inclined to choose A1 more often to counteract this.

Given that irrational behavior can't be assumed and the setup might include experimental balance, a practical balanced approach having a little more safeguard:

#### 4. Recommended Probabilities:
After full consideration:
1. A0 sometimes makes sense if we suspect frequent A1 from the other.
2. A1 covers safety and general cases.

A balance can be struck:

### Final JSON object:
```json
{"A0": 40, "A1": 60}
```

Here:
- Choosing A0 with 40% ensures some engagement for positive points.
- Choosing A1 with 60% optimizes safeguarding strikes and balancing against higher payoff risks.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, we first analyze the payoff structure of the game including the contract.

### 1. Identify Original Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2)
The original point values before the contract are as follows:
- (P1: A0, P2: A0) = (5, 5)
- (P1: A1, P2: A0) = (3, 0)
- (P1: A0, P2: A1) = (0, 3)
- (P1: A1, P2: A1) = (3, 3)

### 2. Apply the Contract
The contract specifies that any player choosing A0 receives 4 points from the other player.
- **Outcome (A0, A0):** Both players choose A0. Each receives 4 points and each gives 4 points. The net adjustment is 0. 
  Final payoff: (5, 5)
- **Outcome (A1, A0):** Player 2 chooses A0 and Player 1 chooses A1. Player 2 receives 4 points from Player 1.
  Original: (3, 0) $\rightarrow$ Adjustment: Player 1 loses 4, Player 2 gains 4.
  Final payoff: (3-4, 0+4) = (-1, 4)
- **Outcome (A0, A1):** Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1. Player 1 receives 4 points from Player 2.
  Original: (0, 3) $\rightarrow$ Adjustment: Player 1 gains 4, Player 2 loses 4.
  Final payoff: (0+4, 3-4) = (4, -1)
- **Outcome (A1, A1):** Neither player chooses A0. No adjustments.
  Final payoff: (3, 3)

### 3. Analyze the Adjusted Payoff Matrix (P1, P2)
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **P1: A1** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

### 4. Determine Optimal Strategy
To maximize total points, we look for dominant strategies:
- **For Player 2 (Me):**
  - If P1 plays A0: A0 gives 5 points, A1 gives -1. (A0 is better)
  - If P1 plays A1: A0 gives 4 points, A1 gives 3. (A0 is better)
  Player 2 has a dominant strategy to play **A0**.

- **For Player 1:**
  - If P2 plays A0: A0 gives 5 points, A1 gives -1. (A0 is better)
  - If P2 plays A1: A0 gives 4 points, A1 gives 3. (A0 is better)
  Player 1 also has a dominant strategy to play **A0**.

In this scenario, A0 is the dominant strategy for both players, leading to the Nash Equilibrium of (5, 5), which is higher than the fallback coordination equilibrium of (3, 3). By choosing A0 with 100% probability, Player 2 maximizes their expected points.

On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Understanding the Original Game

Let me first analyze the game **without** the contract from my perspective (Player 2):

**Payoff Matrix (my payoffs):**
|          | P1 plays A0 | P1 plays A1 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| I play A0| 5           | 0           |
| I play A1| 3           | 3           |

The game is symmetric for both players.

## Step 2: Finding Nash Equilibrium Without Contract

If Player 1 plays A0 with probability p:
- My expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- My expected payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

I'm indifferent when 5p = 3, giving p = 3/5.

By symmetry, the Nash equilibrium is both players playing A0 with probability 3/5 and A1 with probability 2/5.

**Expected payoff without contract:** 
= (9/25)(5) + (6/25)(0) + (6/25)(3) + (4/25)(3) = 3 points

## Step 3: Understanding the Contract Terms

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0: they receive +5 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1: no additional payments

## Step 4: Payoffs With Contract

**New Payoff Matrix (my payoffs with contract):**
|          | P1 plays A0 | P1 plays A1 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| I play A0| 5+5-5 = 5   | 0+5-0 = 5   |
| I play A1| 3+0-5 = -2  | 3+0-0 = 3   |

## Step 5: Finding Nash Equilibrium With Contract

If Player 1 plays A0 with probability p:
- My expected payoff from A0: 5p + 5(1-p) = **5** (constant!)
- My expected payoff from A1: -2p + 3(1-p) = 3 - 5p ≤ 3

**A0 strictly dominates A1** regardless of what Player 1 does!

The same logic applies to Player 1 (by symmetry).

**Nash equilibrium with contract:** Both players always play A0.

**Expected payoff with contract:** 5 points

## Step 6: Decision

**Without contract:** 3 points expected
**With contract:** 5 points expected

The contract increases my expected payoff by 67% (from 3 to 5 points). It solves the coordination problem by making cooperation (A0, A0) a dominant strategy equilibrium instead of requiring a mixed strategy.

Let's go through this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game without contracts

We are in a two-player game with actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2; but remember: **you are Player 2**, so payoffs for you are the second entries in each cell):

| Your Action \ Opponent | A0       | A1       |
|------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                 | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| **A1**                 | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

So for **you (Player 2)**:
- If both play A0: you get 5
- If you play A0, opponent plays A1: you get 3
- If you play A1, opponent plays A0: you get 0
- If both play A1: you get 3

---

### Step 2: Identify the Nash equilibrium in the base game

We can analyze best responses.

Let’s suppose the opponent plays A0 with probability \( p \), A1 with \( 1-p \).

Your expected payoff for playing A0:
- \( E(A0) = p \cdot 5 + (1-p) \cdot 3 = 5p + 3 - 3p = 2p + 3 \)

Your expected payoff for playing A1:
- \( E(A1) = p \cdot 0 + (1-p) \cdot 3 = 3(1-p) = 3 - 3p \)

Set equal to find indifference:
- \( 2p + 3 = 3 - 3p \)
- \( 5p = 0 \Rightarrow p = 0 \)

So you're indifferent only when opponent plays A0 with probability 0 (i.e., always A1).

But let’s check the best responses:
- If opponent plays A0 (p=1): you prefer A0 (5 > 0)
- If opponent plays A1 (p=0): you prefer A1 (3 > 0)

So no pure strategy equilibrium? Wait, check for pure strategy Nash equilibria.

Check (A0, A0): each gets 5. If you deviate to A1, you get 0 < 5 → no incentive. So it is a NE? But wait—opponent: if you play A0, opponent gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so opponent is best off playing A0. So **(A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium**.

Check (A1, A1): both get 3. If you deviate to A0, you get 3 (same), so no incentive? Let's see: if both play A1 → you get 3. If you switch to A0, and opponent still plays A1 → you get 3. So you are indifferent.

But opponent: if you play A1, opponent playing A1 gives 3; playing A0 gives 0. So opponent wants to stay on A1.

So (A1, A1) is also a NE.

Now check (A0, A1): you play A0, opponent A1 → you get 3, opponent gets 3.

But opponent: if they deviate to A0, they get 5 > 3 → so not stable.

Check (A1, A0): you get 0, opponent gets 3. You want to switch to A0 (gain 5), so not stable.

So pure NE: **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)**

Now consider mixed strategy: suppose you play A1 with probability q.

Opponent’s expected payoff for playing A0: \( 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q \)

For A1: \( 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 \)

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5

So for opponent, indifferent when you play A1 with 3/5.

Then opponent will mix if you mix at q=3/5.

But we don’t need the full equilibrium — just know there are multiple equilibria.

---

### Step 3: Understand the contract system

There are **two contracts** proposed.

We are to approve or reject each.

- **C1**: Proposed by Player 1
  - If you choose A0: you get +4 points (paid equally *from the other player*)
  - If you choose A1: no additional payment

- **C2**: Proposed by Player 2
  - No additional payments for either action, for either player.

So only **C1** changes the payoffs.

Note: The contract affects both players, symmetrically, but the **payment is drawn equally from the other player**.

So for C1:
- When a player chooses A0:
  - They get +4 points (bonus)
  - This bonus is drawn equally from the other player → so the other player loses 2 points.

Wait — let's clarify: "drawn equally from the other players" → plural? Probably a typo — likely means "from the other player" (singular). So one player gains +4, the other loses 2 (half of 4).

But wait: “drawn equally from the other players” — if there are two players, and it's “from the other players”, but only one other player.

So likely: when a player chooses A0, they gain +4, and the other player loses 2 (so net transfer of 4 from other to self), but total sum changes.

But let’s test this interpretation.

Suppose both play A0:
- Each gets +4 from the contract → but then each must pay 2 to the other?

Wait — that would be inconsistent.

Better interpretation: For each player who chooses A0, they receive 4 added points, and those 4 points are taken equally from the **other player(s)**.

Since there is one other player, that means: the *other player* loses 4 points.

But that can't be: "drawn equally" — “equal” between whom?

Possibility: If both players choose A0, each gets +4, but each loses 4 (since the other takes 4 from them)? That would make total loss of 8 — but that seems odd.

Alternatively: the net cost is covered by the other player. So if a player chooses A0, they gain 4, and the other player loses 4.

So the **contract implementation is**:
- When a player chooses A0: they get +4; the *other player* loses 4.
- When a player chooses A1: nothing.

So it’s a **transfer from the other player to the A0-choice player**, of 4 points **per A0 choice**.

But if both choose A0, then:
- Player 1 chooses A0 → gets +4, Player 2 loses 4
- Player 2 chooses A0 → gets +4, Player 1 loses 4
- Net: both get +4 -4 = 0 → no net change.

But wait — this suggests symmetric transfer: each player who plays A0 gains 4 and imposes a 4 loss on the other.

So for each player, if they play A0, they gain 4, and the other loses 4.

But only if the contract is in effect.

So **payoff under C1**:

Let’s define:

For each outcome, we compute **base payoff + contract adjustment**.

We are **Player 2**.

Let’s build the full matrix under **C1**.

| You (P2) \ Opp (P1) | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P2)**          |         |         |
| **A1 (P2)**          |         |         |

Now fill in payoffs for **you (Player 2)**.

#### Case: Both A0
- Base: you get 5
- You played A0 → +4 from contract
- Opponent played A0 → your payoff is reduced by 4 (because opponent gains 4, which is taken from you)
- So total: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5

Wait — but **you** played A0 → you gain 4, **opponent** played A0 → opponent gains 4, so **you** lose 4 to the opponent.

So net: 5 + 4 (your gain) - 4 (opponent gains from you) = 5

Similarly, opponent: base 5, gets +4 from their A0, loses 4 to you → still 5

So both still get 5.

Wait, interesting.

Now: **You A0**, **Opponent A1**

- Base: you get 3 (since opponent played A1, you A0 → (0,3) in base, but you are P2 → 3)
- You played A0 → gain +4
- Opponent played A1 → so no gain or loss for them → so no cost
- But: **you** get +4 for playing A0
- **Opponent** does not play A0 → so no loss to them
- So: only **you** gain 4 → you get 3 + 4 = 7

Wait — but the contract says: **“if a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4, drawn equally from the other players.”**

So only **players who choose A0** get paid.

So if only one player chooses A0, that player gets +4, and the other loses 4.

But here, only you play A0 → so you get +4, opponent loses 4.

So your payoff: base 3 + 4 = 7

Opponent’s payoff: their base was 0 (they played A1, you A0 → they get 0), then they lose 4 → -4

Wait! But in base, opponent got 0, now loses 4 → -4

So payoff table under C1:

| You \ Opp | A0         | A1         |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **A0**    | 5          | **7**      |
| **A1**    | **-1**     | 3          |

Let me double-check:

#### (A0, A0)
- You: base 5, +4 (your choice), -4 (opponent chose A0, so you lose 4) → 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
- Opp: same → 5

#### (A0, A1)
- You: base 3, +4 (you played A0), opp did NOT play A0 → no loss from opp → total: 7
- Opp: base 0, no bonus (did A1), but you played A0 → so opp loses 4 → 0 - 4 = -4

#### (A1, A0)
- You: base 0 (you played A1, opp A0 → you get 0), you played A1 → no bonus, opponent played A0 → you lose 4 → base 0 - 4 = -4?
Wait, no: in base, when you play A1, opp A0 → you get 0 (since (A1, A0) → (3, 0) → you get 0)

But under contract: you played A1 → no bonus
Opponent played A0 → so opponent gets +4, and you (the other player) lose 4

So you get 0 - 4 = -4

Opponent: base 3, +4 → 7

#### (A1, A1)
- You: base 3, played A1 → no bonus, opp played A1 → no bonus → so no adjustments → 3
- Opp: same → 3

So revised payoff matrix (for **you, Player 2**) is:

| You \ Opp | A0       | A1       |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **A0**    | 5        | 7        |
| **A1**    | -4       | 3        |

Now, **your objective is to maximize your expected points** under the final action selection.

We are to **approve** a contract or not.

After all approvals, the winning contract is the one with the **maximum number of approvals**, chosen uniformly at random if tie.

But **you are only deciding your own approvals**.

So you must think: **Which contract(s) will lead to better outcomes for you (Player 2)**?

---

Now evaluate **C1** (Player 1’s contract) vs **C2** (Player 2’s contract)

**C2**: No additional payments → base game, payoffs as original.

So under C2, payoff matrix for you (P2):

| You \ Opp | A0 | A1 |
|-----------|----|----|
| **A0**    | 5  | 3  |
| **A1**    | 0  | 3  |

Under C1: as above:
| You \ Opp | A0 | A1 |
|-----------|----|----|
| **A0**    | 5  | 7  |
| **A1**    | -4 | 3  |

So **C1 dramatically changes** the incentives.

In C1, **you have huge incentive to play A0**, because:
- If opponent plays A0: you get 5 (same as before)
- If opponent plays A1: you get 7 (up from 3) → big gain
- Opponent’s best response: if you play A0, opponent gets 7 (if they play A0) or 3 (if A1)? No

Wait — **you are only concerned with your expected payoff**, but **the other player will also choose strategically** in their own interest.

So we need to simulate **what happens under each contract**, assuming both players act optimally (rational, self-interested).

---

### Step 4: Analyze best responses under C1

**C1 payoff matrix (for you)**:

| You \ Opp | A0 | A1 |
|-----------|----|----|
| **A0**    | 5  | 7  |
| **A1**    | -4 | 3  |

So your **best response**:
- If opponent plays A0: you get 5 (A0) vs -4 (A1) → you prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1: you get 7 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → you prefer A0

So **A0 is a dominant strategy for you under C1**.

You will always play A0.

Now, what does **Player 1 (opponent)** do?

They also choose to maximize their own payoff under C1.

Let’s compute **Player 1’s payoffs** under C1.

Recall:

- Player 1 (P1) is the row player.
- Payoff structure: same contract.
- When P1 plays A0: +4, and P2 (you) loses 4
- When P1 plays A1: no bonus, no cost

So P1’s payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------|----|----|
| **A0**  | 5  | 3  |
| **A1**  | 7  | 3  |

Wait — let’s compute:

**Case (A0, A0)**: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0 → P1 gets base 5 + 4 (bonus) - 4 (P2 plays A0 → P1 loses 4) → 5 + 4 - 4 = 5

**Case (A0, A1)**: P1 A0, P2 A1 → base: P1 gets 3 (since (A0,A1) → (0,3) for (P1,P2)? No:

Wait — base payoff: (P1, P2)
- (A0, A0) → (5,5)
- (A0, A1) → (0,3)
- (A1, A0) → (3,0)
- (A1, A1) → (3,3)

So under contract:

**P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A1** (i.e., (A0,A1)):
- P1 base: 0
- P1 played A0 → gets +4
- P2 played A1 → no bonus for P2 → so no cost to P1
- So P1 gets 0 + 4 = 4

But earlier I said 3 — no, mistake.

Let’s recompute P1's payoffs under C1.

**P1 (Opponent)** payoffs:

#### (P1, P2) = (A0, A0)
- Base: 5
- P1 played A0 → +4
- P2 played A0 → so P1 loses 4 to P2
- Total: 5 + 4 - 4 = 5

#### (A0, A1)
- P1 base: 0
- P1 played A0 → +4
- P2 did **not** play A0 → so P1 does **not** lose anything
- So P1 gets: 0 + 4 = 4

#### (A1, A0)
- P1 base: 3
- P1 played A1 → no bonus
- P2 played A0 → so P1 loses 4
- Total: 3 - 4 = -1

#### (A1, A1)
- P1 base: 3
- A1 → no bonus
- P2 A1 → no cost
- Total: 3

So **P1's payoff matrix**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0     | A1     |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **A0**  | 5      | 4      |
| **A1**  | -1     | 3      |

P1’s best responses:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs -1 (A1) → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 4 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0

So **P1 also has A0 as a dominant strategy under C1**.

Thus, under C1, **both players play A0**.

Final outcome: (A0, A0) with payoffs:
- You (P2): 5
- P1: 5

So **you get 5 points** under C1.

Now, under **C2** (no contract):
- No additional payments.
- You and opponent choose optimally.

We already saw: **two pure NEs**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

In (A0, A0): you get 5
In (A1, A1): you get 3

So if you’re optimistic, and believe the game will play (A0, A0), you get 5.

But if coordination fails, might end at (A1, A1) and you get 3.

But in **rational play**, which equilibrium is more likely?

But note: **(A0, A0)** is Pareto optimal: (5,5) vs (3,3)

And (A0, A0) is risk-dominant? Let’s check.

In games like this, (A0, A0) is likely to be the focal point.

But to be precise: is there a unique rational outcome?

Wait — let’s see if **A0 is dominant** in base game?

For you (P2), base payoffs:
- A0: if P1 A0 → 5, if P1 A1 → 3 → average depends
- A1: if P1 A0 → 0, if P1 A1 → 3

So no dominant strategy.

Best response: if P1 plays A0, you prefer A0 (5 > 0); if P1 plays A1, you prefer A1 (3 > 0)

So if you believe P1 might play A0, you prefer A0.

But no strict dominance.

So there are two Nash equilibria.

But **C1 leads to a unique equilibrium: both play A0 → you get 5**.

Under C2, if players coordinate on (A0, A0), you get 5.

But if they don’t coordinate, and end up at (A1, A1), you get 3.

So **C1 gives you guaranteed 5**, under rational play.

**C2** gives you **5 if coordination succeeds**, but **3 otherwise**.

But we are to maximize **your expected points**, assuming rational players.

In C2, the equilibrium selection is ambiguous.

But in **C1**, there is a **dominant strategy equilibrium**, so **unambiguous outcome**: both play A0, you get 5.

So **C1 guarantees 5**.

Now, is there a risk? No — in C1, you get 5 for sure.

Under C2, you only get 5 if both choose A0.

But in the base game, (A0, A0) is risk-dominant in some sense?

Let’s compute the symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium in the base game.

Let P2 play A0 with probability q.

P1’s expected payoff from A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q  
From A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3  
Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5

So P1 is indifferent when you play A0 with q=3/5

Similarly, for P2: P1 plays A0 with p → your expected payoff from A0: 5p + 3(1−p) = 2p + 3  
From A1: 0p + 3(1−p) = 3(1−p)  
Set equal: 2p + 3 = 3(1−p) → 2p + 3 = 3 − 3p → 5p = 0 → p = 0

Wait — this implies that **you will never play A0** in mixed strategy?

Wait, no: let’s check.

Set your payoff from A0 and A1 equal: 2p + 3 = 3 − 3p → 5p = 0 → p = 0

So you are willing to mix only if p = 0 (i.e., opponent always plays A1)

But if p > 0, then E(A0) = 2p + 3 > 3 ≥ E(A1) → so you prefer A0

So **in equilibrium**, you play A0 with prob 1 only if opponent plays A1 with high prob?

Actually, the **symmetric mixed strategy NE** is where both mix.

But the only solution is p = 0? That can’t be.

Wait: earlier I derived that for P1 to be indifferent, q = 3/5

For P2 to be indifferent: 2p + 3 = 3 − 3p → 5p = 0 → p=0

But if p=0, then P1 always plays A1, which makes E(A0) for P2: 2(0)+3=3, E(A1)=3 → indifferent.

But if P2 mixes with q=3/5, then P1's payoff from A0: 5*(3/5) = 3, from A1: 3 → so P1 is indifferent.

So yes — a **mixed strategy NE** where:
- P1 plays A0 with probability 0 (i.e., always A1)
- P2 plays A0 with probability 3/5

But that’s not symmetric.

Alternatively, if both play mixed, let’s suppose:
- P1 plays A0 with p
- P2 plays A0 with q

For P1 to be indifferent: E(A0) = 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q  
E(A1) = 3q + 3(1−q) = 3  
Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5

For P2 to be indifferent: E(A0) = 5p + 3(1−p) = 2p + 3  
E(A1) = 0p + 3(1−p) = 3(1−p)  
Set equal: 2p + 3 = 3(1−p) → 2p + 3 = 3 − 3p → 5p = 0 → p=0

So P1 must play A0 with p=0 (i.e., A1 always)

P2 must play A0 with q=3/5

So the only **mixed strategy NE** is:
- P1 plays A1 always
- P2 plays A0 with 3/5

Then expected payoff for P2: if P1 always A1, then P2:
- Play A0: 3 (base)
- Play A1: 3 (base)
- But since indifferent, any mixture gives 3

So **expected payoffs** in NE are:
- P1: 3 (since always A1, P2 plays A0 3/5 of the time → P1 gets 0 with prob 3/5, 3 with prob 2/5 → 0*(3/5) + 3*(2/5) = 6/5 = 1.2? Wait no)

Wait: if P1 plays A1 always, P2 plays A0 with q=3/5 → so outcomes:
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0 → prob 3/5
- (A1, A1): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 3 → prob 2/5

So P2’s expected payoff: 0*(3/5) + 3*(2/5) = 6/5 = 1.2

But earlier I thought pure NE are (A0,A0) and (A1,A1) → both give P2 5 or 3.

But in **mixed strategy NE**, P2 gets only 1.2?

That seems very low.

But yes, because in this mixed equilibrium, P1 plays A1 always, P2 plays A0 with 3/5 — but P1 gets 3 always in base? No:

Wait: if P1 plays A1, and P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 3 (since (A1,A0) → (3,0))

If P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 3 (from (A1,A1))

So P1 always gets 3.

P2: gets 0 with prob 3/5, 3 with 2/5 → 6/5 = 1.2

So in this NE, P2 gets 1.2.

But this is not a symmetric NE — it's asymmetric.

But in this game, **the only Nash equilibria are**:
- (A0,A0): payoffs (5,5)
- (A1,A1): payoffs (3,3)
- And the asymmetric mixed strategy: P1 plays A1 always, P2 plays A0 with 3/5 and A1 with 2/5

The last one gives P2 only 1.2 — very bad.

So **rational players** would avoid this.

So **likely outcomes** are either (A0,A0) or (A1,A1)

(A0,A0) is better for both.

In fact, **(A0,A0) is a focal point**, and likely to be selected.

So under C2, **you can reasonably expect to get 5**.

But under C1, you **guarantee 5**.

So **C1 is at least as good as C2**, and possibly better if coordination fails.

Moreover, under C1, **you are guaranteed 5**.

But is there any risk?

Wait — under C1, we said both play A0 → you get 5.

But what if the other player does not approve C1?

Ah! The contract only takes effect **if both players approve it**? Wait no.

Let’s read carefully:

> a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process.

So **both players must approve the contract** for it to be active.

But you are only deciding your own approvals.

So **if you reject C1, it won’t be implemented**, even if Player 1 approves.

But the **winning contract** is selected from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve C1, and Player 1 approves, then C1 has 2 approvals.

If you don’t, and Player 1 does, then C1 has 1.

Similarly, C2: Player 2 proposes it.

So C2 has at least 1 approval (your own, if you approve).

But can it have 2? Only if Player 1 also approves.

But Player 1 proposed C1 — unlikely to approve C2?

But we don’t know.

But your goal is to **maximize your expected points**.

So you must consider **which contract is more likely to be selected**, and what your payoff is under it.

But the final contract is **selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So let’s suppose:

- You approve C1 and C2 → then:
  - C1: approvals = 1 (only you) unless Player 1 approves
  - C2: approvals = 2 (you and possibly Player 1)

But you don’t know Player 1’s approval.

But we can assume **rational players approve contracts they like**.

### Step 5: Determine Player 1’s incentive

Player 1 proposed **C1**.

Let’s see if **C1 is good for Player 1**.

We already computed Player 1’s payoffs under C1:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|---------|----|----|
| **A0**  | 5  | 4  |
| **A1**  | -1 | 3  |

So Player 1’s best response: always plays A0 → guaranteed payoff 5 (since if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 5; if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4 — both better than A1)

So **under C1, P1 gets at least 4, and can get 5**.

In base game: P1’s best is (A0,A0): gets 5, or (A1,A1): gets 3, or possibly 0.

So under C1, P1 can get 5 — same as base.

But under C1, if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4 — still better than base (0 or 3).

In base: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 0 (if P1 plays A0) or 3 (if A1) → so maximum 3.

Under C1: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 4 if plays A0, or 3 if plays A1 → so best to play A0 → gets 4.

So **P1 is strictly better off under C1** no matter what P2 does.

Because:
- If P2 A0: P1 gets 5 (vs base 5) → same
- If P2 A1: P1 gets 4 (vs base 3) → better

So **P1 strictly prefers C1 over base payoffs**.

Therefore, **Player 1 will approve C1**.

What about C2? Proposed by Player 2.

C2 gives no change. So P1’s payoff is same as base.

But in base game, P1 can get 5 (at (A0,A0)), 3 (at (A1,A1)), or 0 (if (A0,A1))

But under C2, the game is unchanged.

But if C1 is available, P1 can do **at least as well** (gets 4-5), whereas under C2, if coordination fails, P1 might get only 3.

So **P1 prefers C1 to C2**, and since C1 is better, **will approve C1**, but **not C2**.

So likely:
- Player 1 approves C1, not C2.
- You must decide.

Now, your payoffs:

### Under C1:
- **You get 5** (because both play A0 under rational play)

### Under C2:
- **You get 5**, if the game reaches (A0,A0)
- **You get 3**, if (A1,A1)
- **Possible mixed NE** gives only 1.2 — bad

But likely outcome: **(A0,A0)** — so **you get 5**

But in C1, **you are guaranteed 5**, in C2, **you get 5 only if coordination happens**.

And **C1 eliminates the coordination problem**.

Moreover, **in C1, the other player also prefers it**.

So if you approve C1, then:
- C1 gets 2 approvals (you and P1) → it wins
- You get 5

If you approve **only C2**, then:
- C2 has 1 approval (you)
- C1 has 1 approval (P1)
- So max approvals = 1
- Winning contract: **uniform random from contracts with max approvals**, so both C1 and C2 have 1 approval → each has 50% chance to win

So your expected payoff under this scenario:
- With 50% chance: contract C1 is in effect → you get 5
- With 50% chance: contract C2 is in effect → you get 5 (assuming (A0,A0) coordination)

So expected payoff: 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5

Same as if C1 wins.

But if you **only approve C2**, then **C1 might not be selected**, and if C2 is selected, you get 5.

But in **both cases**, you get 5.

But wait — if only C2 is approved by anyone, and C2 wins, you get 5.

But is there a risk?

In C2, if the game goes to (A1,A1), you get 3.

But **in the Nash equilibria**, (A1,A1) is also supported.

But if you approve only C2, and C2 wins, then the game is played with no contract → outcome uncertain.

But **in rational play**, the (A0,A0) equilibrium is more likely, so you might still get 5.

But to be conservative, suppose that under C2, **you get 5 with probability 1** (focal point).

Then your expected payoff is still 5 in all scenarios.

But now, what if you **approve neither**?

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (P1)
- C2: 0 (you didn’t approve)
- So C1 has max approvals (1) → C1 wins
- You get 5

So in **any case**, you get 5?

Wait — let’s see:

| Your approval | C1 approvals | C2 approvals | Max approvals | Winning contract | Your payoff |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| C1 only      | 2            | 0            | 2              | C1               | 5           |
| C1 & C2      | 2            | 1            | 2              | C1 (randomly chosen from C1, C2 if tie — but C1 has 2, C2 has 1 → C1 wins) | 5 |
| C2 only      | 1            | 1            | 1              | C1 or C2 (50/50) → expected payoff: 0.5*5 + 0.5*5 = 5 |
| Neither      | 1            | 0            | 1              | C1               | 5 |

In **all cases**, you get **5**.

But is that true?

Wait — in C2 only scenario:
- If C2 wins, you get 5 (if coordination at (A0,A0))
- If C2 loses, you don’t get anything? No — contract is either C1 or C2.

But if C2 wins, the game is played under C2.

And under C2, you can get 5.

But is there a possibility of getting less than 5?

Yes — if, under C2, they play (A1,A1), you get 3.

But what is the **expected payoff** under C2?

In the C2 game, the likely outcome is (A0,A0) → 5

But if we assume **rational players coordinate on the Pareto-optimal equilibrium**, then payoff is 5.

So **you get 5**.

Therefore, in **all scenarios**, you get 5.

But wait — in the **mixed strategy NE**, you get 1.2 — but rational players avoid that because they can coordinate on (A0,A0).

So yes, you get 5.

Hence, **all options give you 5 points**.

So why prefer one?

But wait — in **C2 only approval** case, if C2 wins, you get 5.

But under C2, both players are playing the base game, so you get 5 only if (A0,A0).

But **under C1**, you **guarantee** 5.

Under C2, **you might get 3**.

So if you are **risk-averse**, C1 is better.

But even if not, in expectation, if you assume coordination, it's 5.

But **C1 makes coordination unnecessary**.

Moreover, **C1 is better for you than base, because**:

In C1: you get 5 for sure.

In C2: you might get 3.

But can you do better than 5?

No.

So **C1 is at least as good, and better in a risk-averse sense**.

But **is C1 actually good for you?**

Yes.

But wait — earlier I assumed C1 leads to (A0,A0), but is that true?

Under C1, you play A0 always.

Opponent also plays A0 always.

You get 5.

But under C1, if your payoff were lower, you’d reject.

But here, you get 5 — same as base (A0,A0).

So no gain.

But in C2, you might get 3 if coordination fails.

So C1 **protects you from coordination failure**.

Hence, **C1 is safer**.

Now, C2: you proposed it.

But it gives **no benefit** — it’s the status quo.

So why approve it?

Only if you think C1 might not be approved.

But in all cases, **you get 5**, but only if C1 is selected or C2 is selected with coordination.

But **if you approve C1**, you ensure that C1 wins (since P1 approves it), so you get 5.

If you only approve C2, there's a 50% chance C1 wins and you get 5, and 50% chance C2 wins and you get 5 (if coordination) — still 5.

But **C1 gives certainty**, C2 gives uncertainty.

But to maximize minimum expected payoff, you prefer C1.

But since in all cases you get 5, perhaps it doesn't matter.

But wait — what if under C2, **both players play A1**?

For example, if they are afraid of the other playing A0.

But in base game, (A1,A1) is NE.

So if **coordination fails**, you get 3.

So your **expected payoff under C2** depends on coordination probability.

But if P1 has no incentive to approve C2 — they prefer C1 — and you approve C1, then C1 wins.

So the **only way you get less than 5** is if C2 is selected and players play (A1,A1).

But since C1 is better for both players, and P1 will approve C1, then **C1 will win if you approve it**.

But to **ensure** C1 wins, you should approve it.

And **C2 gives you no benefit** — it's the base game.

So you should **approve C1**.

And **disapprove C2**, because it is **worse** (gives you no upgrade, and might lead to worse outcomes if coordination fails).

But C2 is just the base game.

Approving C2 is like saying “I’m okay with the base game.”

But if you approve C1, and since P1 must approve C1 (as it's better for them), then C1 will be enacted.

And you get 5.

If you approve C2 but not C1, then C1 has 1 approval, C2 has 1 — so one chosen at random.

Then you might get 5 (if C1) or 5 (if C2 with coordination).

But if C2 is selected, and players play (A1,A1), you get 3.

So **expected payoff under "C2 only approval"**:
- 50% chance: C1 → you get 5
- 50% chance: C2 → you get 5 if coordination, 3 if not.

But if we assume coordination, 5.
But if not, 3.

But rational players should coordinate on (A0,A0) under C2.

So likely 5.

But still, **C1 provides certainty**, while C2 does not.

Therefore, to **maximize your expected payoff**, you should **approve C1** and **not approve C2**, because:

- C1 is better than base (no risk of coordination failure)
- C2 offers no advantage

Moreover, **C2 only matters if C1 is not available**, but C1 will be available if you approve it.

Hence, **best to approve C1 only**.

Final answer:

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs under Contract 1

With Contract 1, playing A0 gives +4 from the other player:

- (A0, A0): I get 5+4-4 = 5 (both pay/receive 4)
- (A0, A1): I get 0+4 = 4 (I receive 4, they pay 4)
- (A1, A0): I get 3-4 = -1 (I pay 4, they receive 4)
- (A1, A1): I get 3 (no transfers)

**Nash Equilibrium Analysis:**
- If I play A0: Expected payoff = 5p + 4(1-p) = p + 4
- If I play A1: Expected payoff = -p + 3(1-p) = 3 - p

Since p + 4 > 3 - p for all p ∈ [0,1], I always prefer A0. By symmetry, Player 1 also always prefers A0.

**Equilibrium: (A0, A0) → I get 5 points**

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs under Contract 2

With Contract 2, playing A1 costs 1 point to the other player:

- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0+1 = 1 (they pay me 1)
- (A1, A0): I get 3-1 = 2 (I pay them 1)
- (A1, A1): I get 3-1+1 = 3 (we each pay 1 and receive 1)

**Nash Equilibrium Analysis:**
This game has three Nash equilibria:
1. **(A0, A0): I get 5** (Pareto dominant and risk dominant)
2. (A1, A1): I get 3
3. Mixed strategy: Expected payoff ≈ 2.6

The (A0, A0) equilibrium is most likely, but there's coordination risk.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **No contract**: Mixed equilibrium → Expected payoff = 3
- **Contract 1**: Pure equilibrium (A0, A0) → Guaranteed 5
- **Contract 2**: Most likely (A0, A0) → 5, but with coordination risk

## Step 5: Strategic voting decision

Contract 1 is clearly best (guaranteed 5 with no coordination risk). Contract 2 could give 5 but has risk. 

If I approve only C1:
- If Player 1 approves C1: C1 wins (best outcome)
- If Player 1 approves both: C1 has 2 votes, C2 has 1 → C1 wins (best outcome)
- If Player 1 approves only C2: Tied at 1 each → 50/50 random

Since Player 1 likely prefers C1 (same analysis applies to them), approving only C1 maximizes the chance C1 wins.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understanding the Modified Payoffs

First, let me calculate the actual payoffs after including the contract terms.

**Original payoffs (me, Player 1):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Contract effect:**
- If I choose A0: I get +5 points, Player 1 pays -5 points
- If Player 1 chooses A0: Player 1 gets +5 points, I pay -5 points
- If either chooses A1: no contract payment

## Step 2: Calculate Final Payoffs with Contract

Let me compute each outcome:

1. **Both choose A0**: 
   - Base: (5, 5)
   - I chose A0: +5 for me, -5 for Player 1
   - Player 1 chose A0: -5 for me, +5 for Player 1
   - **Final: (5, 5)**

2. **I choose A0, Player 1 chooses A1**:
   - Base: (0, 3)
   - I chose A0: +5 for me, -5 for Player 1
   - **Final: (5, -2)**

3. **I choose A1, Player 1 chooses A0**:
   - Base: (3, 0)
   - Player 1 chose A0: -5 for me, +5 for Player 1
   - **Final: (-2, 5)**

4. **Both choose A1**:
   - Base: (3, 3)
   - **Final: (3, 3)**

## Step 3: Determine Optimal Strategy

Modified payoff matrix for me:
- If Player 1 plays A0: I get 5 (with A0) vs -2 (with A1) → **A0 is better**
- If Player 1 plays A1: I get 5 (with A0) vs 3 (with A1) → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - I get a higher payoff with A0 regardless of what Player 1 does.

## Step 4: Verify with Expected Values

For any probability p that Player 1 plays A0:
- Expected payoff with A0: 5p + 5(1-p) = 5
- Expected payoff with A1: -2p + 3(1-p) = 3 - 5p ≤ 3

Since 5 > 3 ≥ (3 - 5p) for all valid p ∈ [0,1], playing A0 with 100% probability maximizes my expected payoff.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

Base game matrix (My payoff, Their payoff):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

## Step 2: Analyze the base game

This is a classic stag hunt / coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5)** - the payoff-dominant equilibrium
- **(A1, A1) with payoffs (3, 3)** - the risk-dominant equilibrium

The problem: A1 is "safer" (guarantees 3 points minimum), so there's a coordination risk of both players choosing A1 instead of the better A0.

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs with the contract

If signed, when a player chooses A0, they get +4 points paid by the other player.

Modified game matrix (My payoff, Their payoff):
- (A0, A0): (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = **(5, 5)**
- (A0, A1): (0+4, 3-4) = **(4, -1)**
- (A1, A0): (3-4, 0+4) = **(-1, 4)**
- (A1, A1): **(3, 3)**

## Step 4: Analyze the modified game

With the contract:
- If opponent plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → I prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1: A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → I prefer A0

**A0 now strictly dominates A1!** This is symmetric for both players.

The unique Nash equilibrium becomes **(A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5)**.

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- **With contract**: Guaranteed (A0, A0) → I get **5 points**
- **Without contract**: Risk of (A1, A1) → I might get only **3 points**

## Conclusion

The contract eliminates the coordination risk and ensures we reach the best equilibrium (5, 5). Since Player 1 proposed this contract, they likely intend to sign it. Signing is in my best interest as it guarantees the optimal outcome.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to decide whether **you (Player 2)** should sign the payment contract.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without contract)**

The payoff matrix (from **Player 2's** perspective):

| Your Action ↓ \ Opponent's Action → | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                              | 5  | 0  |
| **A1**                              | 3  | 3  |

This is a symmetric game, but we are Player 2.

Let’s analyze the **original game** first.

#### Best responses:

- If **Player 1 chooses A0**:
  - You get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → best response: **A0**

- If **Player 1 chooses A1**:
  - You get 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → best response: **A1**

So your best response depends on what Player 1 does.

Similarly, we can check Player 1’s perspective (same payoffs), so symmetric.

But in a **simultaneous move game**, we look for Nash equilibria.

Let’s find mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let $ p $ = probability Player 1 plays A0  
Let $ q $ = probability you (Player 2) play A0

We want to find $ q^* $ such that Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1, and vice versa.

#### Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If Player 1 plays A0: $ 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q $
- If Player 1 plays A1: $ 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 $

Set equal for indifference:  
$ 5q = 3 $ → $ q = 3/5 = 0.6 $

So Player 1 is indifferent when Player 2 plays A0 with probability 0.6.

#### Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If Player 2 plays A0: $ 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p $
- If Player 2 plays A1: $ 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 $

Set equal: $ 5p = 3 $ → $ p = 0.6 $

So in the **mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium**, both players play A0 with probability 0.6.

Expected payoff for each player:

Compute expected payoff for Player 2 when both play 0.6:

$$
\text{Expected payoff} = (0.6)(0.6)(5) + (0.6)(0.4)(0) + (0.4)(0.6)(3) + (0.4)(0.4)(3)
$$
$$
= 0.36 \times 5 + 0.24 \times 0 + 0.24 \times 3 + 0.16 \times 3
$$
$$
= 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = 3.0
$$

So **expected payoff in original game (no contract)**: **3 points**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract says:
- If a player chooses **A0**, they receive an **additional +4 points**, **drawn equally from the other player**.
- If a player chooses **A1**, no additional payments.

Note:
- The payment is drawn from the other player → so your **net gain** for playing A0 is +4, but the **other player loses 4 points** (from their base payoff).
- This payment is **only triggered if you play A0**.

But note: the contract is **only active if both players sign**.
So if you **don’t sign**, the contract doesn’t apply.

But here, you are deciding whether to **sign**.

We assume the other player (Player 1) **has already agreed** to sign (since the contract was proposed and approved via voting), but you are the one deciding whether to sign.

So for the contract to take effect, **you must sign too**.

We need to ask: **Should you sign the contract?**

That is: **Will signing lead to a higher expected payoff than 3?**

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the modified game under the contract (if signed)**

Let’s now compute the **new payoff matrix** assuming both players **sign the contract**.

The base payoffs are unchanged, but **if you play A0, you get +4**, **and opponent loses 4**.

So we update the matrix.

Let’s write the new payoffs (you = Player 2):

| Your Action ↓ \ Opponent Action → | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)**                       | 5 + 4 = 9 (you), 5 - 4 = 1 (P1) | 0 + 4 = 4 (you), 3 - 4 = -1 (P1) |
| **A1 (P2)**                       | 3 (you), 0 (P1) | 3 (you), 3 (P1) |

Wait: **only when you play A0**, you get +4, and opponent loses 4.

So:
- If P2 plays A0: you add +4 to your score, subtract 4 from P1's score.
- If P2 plays A1: nothing changes.

So the **new payoff matrix from your (P2) perspective**:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 9  | 4  |
| A1     | 3  | 3  |

Wait, that can't be right if P1 also signed the contract!

Wait — **does the contract apply equally to both players?**

Yes! It says: "if a player chooses A0, they receive +4, drawn equally from the other player."

So **whenever any player plays A0**, they get +4, and the other player loses 4.

So **both players can gain +4 if they play A0**, but only if **they play A0**.

So the contract affects **both players simultaneously**.

So if **both players choose A0**, then:
- You play A0 → gain +4
- Opponent plays A0 → gains +4

So from *your* point of view:
- You get base +4 → so you get 5 (base) + 4 = 9
- Opponent gets 5 (base) + 4 = 9, but **you lose 4** (because you're drawing from you) → but wait, this leads to a **net gain/loss issue**

Wait, this is critical.

How is the +4 "drawn equally from the other player"?

The contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

"drawn equally from the other players" — plural? But there’s only one other player.

Could this mean the payment comes **from the other player**?

Yes. So:

- When you play A0, you get +4, and **the other player loses 4**.
- When the other player plays A0, they get +4, and **you lose 4**.

So the **payoffs for you (P2)** are:

- If **you play A0 and opponent plays A0**:
  - You get base 5 + 4 (from contract) - 4 (because opponent played A0 and you're paying them 4) = **5**
  - Wait — this implies **you gain 4, lose 4 = net 0**, so total = 5?

Let’s think carefully.

The contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you play A0**, you receive +4, and **it’s drawn from the other players**.

Since there's only one other player, that means: **you get +4, opponent loses 4**.

Similarly, if the opponent plays A0, **they get +4**, and **you lose 4**.

So the **net effect** is:

- When **you play A0**, you **gain +4**, and **opponent loses 4**.
- When opponent plays A0, **opponent gains +4**, and **you lose 4**.

So the **total contract payment** across both players is **+4 for one, -4 for the other**, so net zero.

Now let’s compute your **actual payoff** in each case.

#### Case 1: You play A0, Opponent plays A0
- Base payoff: you get 5
- You played A0 → +4 from contract
- Opponent played A0 → you lose 4 (he gets +4 from you)
- So total: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**

#### Case 2: You play A0, Opponent plays A1
- Base payoff: 0
- You played A0 → +4
- Opponent played A1 → no contract effect
- So total: 0 + 4 = **4**

#### Case 3: You play A1, Opponent plays A0
- Base payoff: 3
- You played A1 → no contract effect
- Opponent played A0 → you lose 4
- So total: 3 - 4 = **-1**

#### Case 4: You play A1, Opponent plays A1
- Base payoff: 3
- No one played A0 → no contract effects
- So total: 3

So the **new payoff matrix from your perspective (P2)**:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 5  | 4  |
| A1     | -1 | 3  |

That’s much more informative.

Now, let’s find the **best strategy** in this **contracted game**.

---

### **Step 4: Find Nash equilibrium under the contract**

Let $ q $ = probability you (P2) play A0  
Let $ p $ = probability P1 plays A0

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: $ 5p + 4(1-p) = 5p + 4 - 4p = p + 4 $
- If you play A1: $ -1p + 3(1-p) = -p + 3 - 3p = 3 - 4p $

Set equal for indifference:
$$
p + 4 = 3 - 4p \\
5p = -1 \\
p = -0.2
$$

Wait — $ p = -0.2 $? That’s not possible. Probability can't be negative.

This means **you always prefer A0** over A1, because the equation $ p + 4 > 3 - 4p $ for all $ p \in [0,1] $.

Let’s test:
- At $ p = 0 $: A0 gives 4, A1 gives 3 → A0 better
- At $ p = 1 $: A0 gives 5, A1 gives -1 → A0 better

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for you.

Therefore, **in the contracted game**, **you should play A0 with probability 1**.

Now, what does Player 1 do?

Let’s compute their expected payoff.

Player 1’s payoff (we can compute from their perspective, but we need to know: how do they see things?)

But Player 1 is symmetric: their payoffs are the same.

So let’s write **Player 1’s payoff matrix** (you are P2, so from P1’s view):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 5  | 4  |
| A1     | -1 | 3  |

Wait — same structure.

So Player 1’s expected payoff:
- Play A0: $ 5q + 4(1-q) = q + 4 $
- Play A1: $ -1q + 3(1-q) = 3 - 4q $

So again: $ q + 4 > 3 - 4q $ for all $ q \in [0,1] $ → A0 dominates A1.

So **both players will play A0 with probability 1**.

So in equilibrium, both play A0.

Then, your final payoff:
- From base game: 5
- You played A0 → +4
- Opponent played A0 → you lose 4
- Net: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**

So **your expected payoff under the contract, if you sign, is 5**.

But wait — is that the *only* outcome?

No, but since **A0 dominates**, both players **will** play A0.

So the outcome is **(A0, A0)** → you get 5.

---

### **Step 5: Compare with no contract**

Without the contract, in the mixed strategy equilibrium, your **expected payoff is 3**.

Even if you could coordinate or play pure strategies, the best you can ensure is 3 (if both play A1, you get 3; if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0; so 3 is the best you can do in pure Nash? No — in original game, (A1, A1) is a pure Nash: both get 3).

But (A0, A0) is **not a Nash equilibrium** originally.

- If both play A0, you get 5, but **you want to deviate to A1**? No: if opponent plays A0, you get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so you prefer A0.
- If opponent plays A0, you get 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → so A0 is better.
- But wait: if you play A0, opponent gets 5. If opponent plays A1, they get 0.
- So if you are playing A0, opponent gets 5 for A0, but only 3 for A1? Wait no.

Original base game:
- If (A0, A0): you get 5, opponent gets 5
- If (A0, A1): you get 0, opponent gets 3
- So if opponent sees you play A0, they get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so they prefer A0.
- So both prefer A0 given the other plays A0.

But if you play A0, opponent gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so A0 better.

Similarly, if opponent plays A0, you get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so you prefer A0.

So **(A0, A0) is actually a Nash equilibrium in the original game!** (Both get 5)

And (A1, A1): both get 3.

So (A0, A0) is better for both.

But why didn’t we find it earlier?

Wait — is (A0, A0) a Nash equilibrium?

- If opponent plays A0, you get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so you prefer A0 → no incentive to deviate
- If opponent plays A0, they get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so they prefer A0

So yes — (A0, A0) **is** a Nash equilibrium, with payoff 5 each.

Then why did we calculate mixed strategy with expected payoff 3?

Because **there are multiple equilibria**.

- (A0, A0): payoff 5
- (A1, A1): payoff 3
- Mixed: payoff 3

So in the original game, **the best possible outcome is 5**, if both players coordinate on (A0, A0).

But in a **non-cooperative setting**, players may not coordinate.

But in this case, since the contract **forces coordination toward A0**, and both players have dominant strategy to play A0 under the contract, it **guarantees that outcome**.

Without the contract, you might not get 5 — you might end up in (A1, A1) or mixed.

But under the contract, **you are guaranteed to play A0**, because it's dominant.

So the **contract effectively guarantees the high payoff**.

But wait — without the contract, **(A0, A0)** is also a Nash equilibrium, so you **could** achieve 5 if you both coordinate.

But if you don’t sign the contract, you might not.

But here’s the key: **you don’t know if the other player will play A0**.

But the contract **changes incentives**.

Without the contract, (A0, A0) is a Nash, but so is (A1, A1).

But (A0, A0) is better.

But in practice, players might not coordinate.

But **under the contract**, the **dominant strategy is A0**, so **there is no uncertainty** — you both play A0 for sure.

So if you **sign the contract**, you **get 5 for sure**.

If you **don’t sign**, then the contract doesn't apply, and you’re in the original game.

Now, if the other player **plays A0**, and you play A0, you get 5.

But if they play A1, you get 0.

But you don't know.

So without the contract, your expected payoff depends on what they do.

But if the other player is rational, they might play A0 — but you don't know.

However, **even if both players are rational and play A0**, you get 5.

But **the risk is that they might play A1**.

But the contract **makes A0 dominant**, so you **are guaranteed** to get A0.

Thus, **with the contract**, you are guaranteed 5.

Without the contract, you **could get 5**, but might get 0 or 3, depending.

But **since rational players can coordinate on (A0, A0)**, we might assume that’s the equilibrium outcome.

But here’s the catch: **without the contract, A0 is not a dominant strategy**.

- If opponent plays A0, you prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If opponent plays A1, you prefer A1 (0 < 3)

So A0 is not dominant.

So **in the original game, players might not play A0**.

But **under the contract**, A0 becomes **strictly dominant**.

So signing the contract **eliminates uncertainty and guarantees a high payoff**.

Therefore, **signing the contract leads to a guaranteed 5 points**, while not signing leads to **uncertain payoff**, possibly as low as 0, even if both use rational strategy.

But in the original game, a **rational best-response** leads to either mixed strategy (expected 3) or pure (A1, A1) — but **since (A0, A0) is a Nash**, rational players could coordinate.

But in many such games, (A1, A1) is the **risk-dominant** equilibrium.

Let’s check risk dominance.

In the original game:
- (A0, A0): each gets 5
- (A1, A1): each gets 3

But the **temptation** to defect: if you think opponent plays A0, you get 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → so A0 is better.

But if you think they play A1, you get 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → so you prefer A1.

So **A0 is only safe if you trust them to play A0**.

But the **contract removes this risk**.

So **by signing**, you **lock in A0**, ensuring 5.

Without signing, you might end up in A1, A1, getting 3.

Or worse, if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

So the contract **increases your worst-case payoff**.

- If you sign: guaranteed 5
- If you don’t sign: worst-case is 0 (if opponent plays A1 and you play A0)

So **signing eliminates downside**.

In terms of expected payoff, if you assume that the other player plays A0 with some probability, the contract makes it **optimal to play A0 regardless**, while without contract it’s risky.

But since you are **Player 2**, and can **choose to sign**, and the contract **makes A0 dominant**, **you get 5 for sure**.

Without contract, **the best you can do is hope for coordination on A0**, which may not happen.

So **signing the contract is clearly beneficial**.

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

You should **sign the contract**, because:
- It guarantees you a **safe payoff of 5** (by making A0 dominant)
- Without it, your payoff could be as low as 0
- Even in best-case, you only get 5 if coordinated, but coordination is not guaranteed
- The contract **ensures** the high equilibrium

So the answer is **yes**.

response:
First incorporate the contract into your actual (net) payoff:

- If **you play A0**, you **receive +4** from the other player.
- If **the other player plays A0**, you **pay −4** to them.
- If anyone plays **A1**, no transfer happens for that action.

So your net payoffs become:

1. **(A0, A0)**: base 5, plus +4 (you played A0), minus 4 (they played A0) → **5**
2. **(A0, A1)**: base 0, plus +4 (you played A0) → **4**
3. **(A1, A0)**: base 3, minus 4 (they played A0) → **−1**
4. **(A1, A1)**: base 3 → **3**

Now compare your actions:

- If the other player plays **A0**: A0 gives **5** vs A1 gives **−1** → prefer **A0**
- If the other player plays **A1**: A0 gives **4** vs A1 gives **3** → prefer **A0**

So **A0 strictly dominates A1**, meaning the best strategy is to play **A0 with 100% probability**.

response:
Let me work through this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the Base Payoffs

Without the contract, as Player 2:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Apply the Contract

The contract states:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points from the other player
- If a player chooses A1, no payment

This means:
- When I choose A0: I receive +4 from the other player
- When the other player chooses A0: I pay -4 to them

## Step 3: Calculate Total Payoffs with Contract

Let me compute my total payoff for each outcome:

**If I play A0, other plays A0:**
- Base: 5
- I chose A0: +4
- They chose A0: -4
- **Total: 5**

**If I play A0, other plays A1:**
- Base: 0
- I chose A0: +4
- They chose A1: 0
- **Total: 4**

**If I play A1, other plays A0:**
- Base: 3
- I chose A1: 0
- They chose A0: -4
- **Total: -1**

**If I play A1, other plays A1:**
- Base: 3
- No contract payments
- **Total: 3**

## Step 4: Analyze My Best Strategy

My payoff matrix:
```
              Other: A0    Other: A1
My A0:           5            4
My A1:          -1            3
```

Comparing my options:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5 vs A1 gives me -1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 4 vs A1 gives me 3 → **A0 is better**

**A0 is a dominant strategy** - it's better regardless of what the other player does.

## Step 5: Conclusion

Since A0 strictly dominates A1, I should play A0 with 100% probability.

### Step 1: Understand the original game without the contract

We have a simultaneous-move game with two players. Each chooses A0 or A1 with some probability. The payoffs are as follows:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0         | A1         |
|-----------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                      | 5, 5       | 0, 3       |
| **A1**                      | 3, 0       | 3, 3       |

We are Player 2 (i.e., the second player in the payoff matrix).

In this original game, let’s analyze possible equilibria.

#### Best responses:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You get: 5 (if A0) vs. 3 (if A1) → so best response is A0
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You get: 0 (if A0) vs. 3 (if A1) → so best response is A1

So your best response depends on what the other player does.

Similarly, for Player 1:
- If you play A0: get 5 (if other plays A0), 0 (if other plays A1) → better to play A0 if they play A0
- If you play A1: get 3 (if other plays A0), 3 (if other plays A1) → always 3

So Player 1’s best response:
- If you play A0 → best to play A0 (5 > 3)
- If you play A1 → best to play A1 (3 = 3, but if you play A1, they get 3 either way)

But clearly, (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium (each gets 5, no incentive to deviate).

(A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium: both get 3. If you deviate to A0, you get 0 (since other is A1), which is worse. So yes, (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

There’s also a mixed strategy equilibrium.

But since we’re not told that we’re playing against a fixed strategy, we need to think about *what to do* in this game, particularly in light of the contract.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract proposal

The contract says:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn equally from the other players.  
> If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

This is **drawn equally from the other players**, so if you choose A0, you get +5, and the *other player* loses 5 points.

So in effect, **if you play A0, you get +5 extra, and the other player loses 5.**

This is a transfer: a form of side payment if you choose A0.

But the contract is only active **if both players sign it**.

We are deciding whether to sign.

So if **we sign**, and **the other player also signs**, then the contract takes effect.

If either of us doesn’t sign, the contract is **not active**, and we play the original game.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate the impact of the contract on payoffs

Let’s compute the **new payoff matrix** under the contract (assuming both sign it).

We’ll now compute total payoffs including the contract bonus.

#### New payoffs:

Recall original payoffs, then **add**:
- +5 to the player who plays A0
- -5 to the player who plays A1 → because the bonus is drawn equally from the other player (and only one player gets the bonus)

Wait: the wording says: *"If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."*

So if **you** play A0, you get +5, and the **other player** loses 5 → this is a transfer.

But what happens if **both** play A0? Then **both** get +5, so you get +5, other gets -5?

But that can’t be: if both play A0, both receive +5 from the contract → so both gain 5, but where does that money come from?

Wait: the contract says the payment is "drawn equally from the other players".

So for **each** player who plays A0, they get +5, and **all other players** pay 5 (a fifth of 5 per other player? No — “drawn equally from the other players” — so if there are two players, and one plays A0, they get +5, the other pays -5.

But if **both** play A0, then:
- Each gets +5 from the contract
- But the money must be drawn **from the other players**

So total transfer:
- You play A0 → you get +5, and the other player pays -5
- Other player plays A0 → they get +5, and you pay -5

So net: you pay -5, and get +5 → net 0.
Similarly, the other player: pays -5, gets +5 → net 0.

Thus, **when both play A0**, **no net transfer** from the contract.

Wait — that can't be. If both play A0, then each expects +5, but it must be drawn from others. Since both are others of each other, each pays 5 to the other.

So it cancels.

But let’s suppose you play A0, and other plays A1:
- You get +5 (from contract)
- The other player is not playing A0, so they don’t get +5.
- But the contract says the +5 is **drawn equally from the other players**.
- So if you play A0, you get +5, and the **two players** (you and other) will pay something to fund it.

But there’s only one other player — Player 1.

So to fund the +5, drawn from the other players — so if there are two players and one plays A0 (you), then the other player (Player 1) **must pay 5**.

Similarly, if Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 (you) must pay 5.

But if **both** play A0:
- You get +5, but also must pay 5 (because Player 1 is an “other” and playing A0)
- Player 1 gets +5, but must pay 5 (because you are an “other” and playing A0)
- So net: both get 0 from the contract

Similarly, if **neither** plays A0 (both A1), no one gets +5, no one pays → net 0.

If **only you play A0**:
- You get +5
- Player 1 must pay 5 (since they are the only other player and didn’t play A0? No — but the rule is: “drawn from the other players” — so only the players who are *not* playing A0 are expected to pay?

Wait — let’s re-read.

> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So:
- For each player who chooses A0: they get +5.
- This +5 is **drawn equally from the other players**.

So if there are two players, and only **you** play A0, then:
- You get +5
- The other player (Player 1) must pay 5 → because they are "the other player" (singular), and it's "drawn equally" — equal shares from the others.

But if both play A0:
- You get +5, but must pay 5 (because Player 1 is other and playing A0)
- Player 1 gets +5, but must pay 5 (because you are other and playing A0)
- So net: both get 0 from contract

If only one plays A0:
- The one who plays A0 gets +5
- The other (not playing A0) pays 5

So summarizing the **contract effect**:

| Your Action | Other's Action | Contract Net (for You) |
|------------|----------------|------------------------|
| A0         | A0             | +5 (from contract) - 5 (because other played A0) = 0 |
| A0         | A1             | +5 (from contract) - 0 (other didn’t play A0) = +5 |
| A1         | A0             | +0 (you didn’t play A0) - 5 (because other played A0) = -5 |
| A1         | A1             | 0 (nobody played A0) = 0 |

So contract net transfer is:
- You +5 if you play A0 and other plays A1
- You -5 if you play A1 and other plays A0
- 0 otherwise (both A0 or both A1)

Now, add this to the original payoffs.

Let’s compute the **total payoff matrix** under the contract (when both sign):

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 (other)                  | A1 (other)                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **A0**                        | Original: 5 or 0 → +0 from contract → 5 or 0 | Original: 0 or 3 → +5 from contract → 5 or 8 |
| **A1**                        | Original: 3 or 0 → -5 from contract → -2 or -5 | Original: 3 or 3 → 0 from contract → 3 or 3 |

Let’s fill it:

- (A0, A0): you get 5 (original) + 0 = **5**
- (A0, A1): you get 0 (original) + 5 = **5**
- (A1, A0): you get 3 (original) + (-5) = **-2**
- (A1, A1): you get 3 (original) + 0 = **3**

So the new payoff matrix is:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0 (other) | A1 (other) |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | 5          | 5          |
| **A1**                        | -2         | 3          |

This is **very different** from the original.

Now, let’s check if this is strategically better.

---

### Step 4: Analyze best responses under contract

From your perspective, Player 2:

- If other plays A0:
  - You get: 5 (if A0) vs. -2 (if A1) → so **A0** is better
- If other plays A1:
  - You get: 5 (if A0) vs. 3 (if A1) → so **A0** is better

So **no matter what the other player does, your best response is A0**.

Thus, A0 is a **dominant strategy** under the contract.

So if the contract is active, **you should play A0 for sure**.

And if the other player also signs, they will also have a dominant strategy to play A0 — because similar logic applies symmetrically.

So Nash equilibrium under contract: both play A0 → you get 5 points (from payoff) + 0 (contract) = **5**

Wait — but in (A0, A0), we get 5 from original payoff, 0 from contract → total 5.

But if both play A0, and contract is active, you both play A0 → both get +5 from contract, but also both pay 5 to the other → so contract net zero → yes, total payoff is 5 each.

Alternatively, if you both play A1: you get 3 each → worse than 5.

Or if you play A0, other plays A1: you get 5 (0+5), other gets 3 (3+0)=3? Let’s see:

But if both sign the contract, and you are playing A0, other plays A1:

- You: original 0 (A0 vs A1) → +5 from contract → total 5
- Other: original 3 (A1 vs A0) → but since they played A1, no bonus, and since you played A0, they must pay 5 → so their total = 3 - 5 = -2

So they get -2 — which is worse.

So if the contract is in effect, the best outcome for you is both playing A0 → you get 5.

But what if you sign the contract, and the other player **doesn’t sign**?

Then the contract is **not active** — we play the original game.

So you must compare:

- If you sign: **only if the other also signs**, contract is active → you get at least 5 (if both A0) — but outcome depends on strategy
- If the other doesn’t sign: contract inactive → original game

So the key question is: **do you expect the other player to sign?**

But the contract is approved via approval voting, and it was **proposed by Player 1**.

We are Player 2.

We are deciding whether to sign.

We must consider: **Will Player 1 sign?**

Player 1 is the one who proposed the contract.

But we don’t know their decision — we must evaluate whether it is **rational** for them to sign, and whether it’s rational for us to sign.

Let’s analyze from **Player 1’s** perspective.

---

### Step 5: Analyze whether Player 1 will sign the contract

Player 1 is proposing the contract.

They want to maximize their own payoff.

Before the contract: their best outcome is (A0, A0) → they get 5.

Now, suppose the contract is in effect (i.e., both sign). From their perspective, the payoffs are symmetric.

But we need to compute **their best response** under the contract.

Using the same logic, the contract effect is symmetric.

So for Player 1:

- If you play A0: they get +5 from contract — but only if **they don’t** play A0? Wait no.

Same rule applies.

For Player 1:
- If they play A0 and you play A0 → contract: +5 from contract, -5 from you → net 0
- If they play A0 and you play A1 → +5 from contract, and you are not playing A0 → so no penalty → net +5
- If they play A1 and you play A0 → they get -5 (because you played A0) → net -5
- If both A1 → 0

So their payoff matrix under contract:

| Their Action \ Your Action | A0           | A1           |
|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **A0**                     | 5 (orig 5+0) | 5 (orig 0+5) |
| **A1**                     | -2 (orig 3-5)| 3 (orig 3+0) |

So same as yours: **A0 is dominant strategy**.

So if the contract is active, Player 1 will play A0.

Therefore, under contract, both players will play A0 → payoff: 5 each.

So Player 1: if they sign, and expect you to sign, they get 5.

If they **don’t sign**, then contract inactive → they play the original game.

In original game, they can achieve 5 (via (A0, A0)), but only if you play A0.

But suppose they expect you to play optimally (without contract), what do you do?

In original game:
- Your best response:
  - If they play A0: you prefer A0 (5 vs 3)
  - If they play A1: you prefer A1 (3 vs 0)
- So your best response function: A0 if they play A0, A1 if they play A1.

So if Player 1 plays A0 → you play A0 → both get 5.

So if Player 1 plays A0, you play A0 → outcome (A0, A0) → payoff 5.

If Player 1 plays A1 → you play A1 → outcome (A1, A1) → payoff 3.

So Player 1 knows that if they play A0, they get 5; if they play A1, they get 3. So they will play A0 → outcome (A0, A0) → payoff 5.

So in original game: Player 1 gets 5.

Now, under contract: if they sign, and you sign, they also get 5.

Same outcome.

But — **is there a risk?**

If Player 1 signs, and **you don’t sign**, then the contract is **not active**, so they are back in original game.

But they don’t know if you will sign.

But since the contract is **only active if both sign**, **Player 1 can only benefit if you sign**.

And since the contract is **proposed by them**, and we are to decide, we can assume they will sign **only if they believe they will gain or at least not lose**.

But even if they sign, and you don’t, then contract inactive → they still get 5 (by playing A0), same as before.

So they are not worse off.

But if you also sign, they still get 5.

So for Player 1, **signing the contract is weakly better** (same or better payoff), and they get the **same outcome** regardless.

So they have **no incentive to oppose it**.

But what if they think you might not sign?

Even then, if you don’t sign, they are not worse off.

So from Player 1’s perspective: **signing is safe** — they get at least 5, and possibly more? No — same as before.

But actually — could they get more?

Only if you play A1, but they want to play A0 to get 5, and if you play A0, outcome is (A0, A0), payoff 5.

So no gain.

But they might **prefer** to play A0 anyway.

So **Player 1 will likely sign** the contract — it doesn’t hurt, and gives them the same outcome.

So we can **reasonably assume** that **Player 1 will sign**.

---

### Step 6: Should you sign?

Now, if you sign, and Player 1 signs, contract is active.

Then, as we saw, **you have a dominant strategy to play A0**.

And so does the other player.

So both will play A0 → you get 5 points.

What if you **don’t sign**?

Then the contract is **not active**, and we play the original game.

In the original game, as we saw earlier, there are two equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → you get 5
- (A1, A1) → you get 3

But which one will happen?

Well, in the original game, if Player 1 plays A0, you play A0 → (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

But if they play A1, you play A1 → (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

So there’s **uncertainty**.

But Player 1, in the original game, will **choose A0**, as we saw earlier — because if they play A0, you play A0 → they get 5; if they play A1, you play A1 → they get 3. So they choose A0.

Therefore, **in the original game, outcome is (A0, A0)** → you get 5.

So whether you sign or not, you get **5 points**.

But wait — if you sign, and they sign, outcome is (A0, A0) → you get 5.

If you don’t sign, outcome is (A0, A0) → you get 5.

So same?

But is there a risk?

Earlier we assumed Player 1 will play A0 anyway.

But if you sign, and they play A0, you **must** play A0 (under contract, because it’s dominant).

But in original game, you would also play A0 if they play A0.

So no difference.

But wait — **what if you don’t sign?**

You’re not locked in under the contract.

But in original game, you still get 5.

But let’s suppose you sign.

Then, even if Player 1 plays A1 — which they won’t — but just for argument: under contract, if they play A1, you still want to play A0 (because 5 > 3), so you play A0.

But in original game, if they play A1, you play A1.

So in that case, under contract: you get 5 (from A0 vs A1: 0 + 5 = 5)

In original: you get 3

So better under contract.

But in reality, Player 1 will not play A1 — they will play A0.

But suppose you have a concern: **what if Player 1 doesn’t play A0?**

But we’ve argued they will.

But what if you sign and they don’t?

Then contract inactive → original game → you still get 5.

But if they don’t sign, you still get 5.

And if they do sign, you still get 5.

So no change?

Wait — but under contract, you **must** play A0 if you sign (since it’s dominant), but in original game you’d do the same.

So **no difference in expected payoff**?

But is there anything to gain?

Wait — under contract, your payoff in all cases is **at least 5**?

Let’s see:

Under contract (if both sign):
- If both play A0: you get 5
- If you play A0, other plays A1: you get 5
- If you play A1, other plays A0: you get -2 → bad
- But you won’t do that — because A0 is dominant.

So you will play A0 → so you get either 5 or 5 → so you **always get 5** if contract is active.

In original game: you get 5 (if they play A0) or 3 (if they play A1).

But they play A0 → you get 5.

So **same payoff**.

But — **under contract, you are forced to play A0**.

But in the original game, you would also play A0.

So no difference.

But here’s a catch: **what if Player 1 is uncertain?**

But we’ve analyzed that they will play A0.

But let’s consider a possible **cheap talk** scenario — but we’re not told.

So in equilibrium:

- Without contract: (A0, A0), you get 5
- With contract (if both sign): both play A0, you get 5

Same.

But is there a risk?

Yes — **what if you sign, and they don’t?**

Then contract inactive → original game → you get 5.

But if they sign, you get 5.

Same.

But **what if you sign and they don’t**, but you play A0 (because under contract you’re supposed to play A0)? No — if contract is not active, you are not obligated.

If you sign, but they don’t, contract inactive → you play the original game → you can play A1.

But you **would still** play A0 in original game if they play A0.

But you might choose to deviate?

No — in original game, you only play A0 if they play A0.

But if they play A0, you play A0 → you get 5.

So no loss.

But here’s the key: **if you sign, you are committed to a strategy that includes playing A0**, even if under other circumstances you wouldn’t, but in this case, you would anyway.

But is there any benefit?

Wait — **under the contract, you always get at least 5**, no matter what.

- If both A0: 5
- If you A0, other A1: 5
- If you A1, other A0: -2 — but you won’t do this, since A0 is dominant

So **as long as you play A0**, you get 5.

And you will.

So **you are guaranteed 5 under contract**, if both sign.

In original game, you get 5, **if** they play A0.

But could they play A1?

No — because they get 3 from A1, 5 from A0 — so they play A0.

So **you are guaranteed 5 in both cases**.

So **no benefit**?

But wait — **what if there were multiple equilibria**, and you were worried about coordination?

But in original game, (A0, A0) is the **payoff-dominant** and **risk-dominant** equilibrium? Not sure.

But Player 1 will play A0 regardless.

So **you are guaranteed 5 in both scenarios**.

Therefore, **signing the contract gives no benefit, and no harm**.

But is that true?

Wait — **in the original game, if both A1, you get 3**.

But Player 1 will not choose A1 — they prefer A0.

So (A1, A1) is not played.

So no risk.

But here’s a subtle point: **if you sign the contract, and they sign, you are locked into the dominant strategy, which is safe**.

But in the original game, you also get the same outcome.

So **net effect: expected payoff is the same**.

Therefore, **signing is not worse**, but **not better**.

So should you sign?

We are to **maximize our total points**.

But we must consider: **is there any downside to signing?**

Yes — **if you sign, and the other player does not sign, and you play A0, but the other player plays A1, you get 5** — same as if you play A0 in original game.

But that’s not worse.

But suppose you sign and they don’t — then you are not bound by the contract, so you can play A1 — but you wouldn’t, because it gives you less.

So **you would still play A0 anyway**.

So no difference.

But what if you **could be punished**?

No.

However, **the contract gives you the assurance that if both sign, you get a guaranteed 5**, and you are committed to A0.

But same as original.

But wait — **in the original game, you might worry about (A1, A1)**?

Only if Player 1 plays A1.

But they won’t.

So no.

But perhaps the contract *induces* cooperation.

But in this case, it doesn’t change any outcome.

Therefore, **you are indifferent**.

But the question is: **should you sign**?

Since signing does not reduce your payoff, and the contract is **safely non-negative**, and it doesn’t hurt, and potentially helps if there were coordination failures, but here there are none, **you might as well sign**.

But let’s look back at the numbers.

Under contract, your payoff **if you sign and they sign**: you get 5.

If you sign and they don’t: contract inactive, you get 5.

If you don’t sign: contract inactive, you get 5.

So in all cases, **you get 5**.

So **no difference**.

But is that true?

Wait — what if **you sign** but **they don’t**?

Then you **could** play A1 — but in original game, if they play A0, you should play A0.

And they will.

So you play A0 → get 5.

Same.

But here’s a twist: **if you sign**, you **must** have a strategy — but if contract is inactive, you are free.

But still.

So **your payoff is the same whether you sign or not**.

But the contract is **only active if both sign**.

So if you don’t sign, you are not committing.

But since it doesn’t help, and doesn’t hurt, **you might as well sign**, because it doesn’t cost you anything.

But is there any reason not to?

Yes — **if there were a risk of getting a lower payoff**.

But there isn’t.

But let’s think: suppose you sign, and the other player **does not sign**, and they are playing A1.

But they won’t — because A0 gives them 5, A1 gives 3.

So they play A0.

But suppose in a world where they were irrational, but we assume rationality.

Therefore, **your payoff is 5 in all scenarios**.

So **signing is safe**.

But to maximize expected payoff, since it's the same, you can choose.

But the question is: **should you sign**?

Well, **if you sign, and they sign, you are guaranteed a good outcome**, and you have no downside.

But **if you don’t sign**, and they do, then contract inactive — you still get 5.

So no difference.

But the contract might be a way to **coordinate on A0**.

But already achieved.

Therefore, **signing is optional**.

Since it doesn't hurt, and **might help in case of miscoordination**, but here there is no miscoordination risk, so no benefit.

But since there is no cost, and no benefit, **you are indifferent**.

But the contract is **proposed by Player 1** and **approved by approval voting** — so it's meant to be accepted.

But as Player 2, we are to decide.

But let’s think: **what if we don’t sign, but they do?**

Then contract is inactive — because both must sign.

So no change.

So **only if you sign and they sign, contract active**.

But since not signing doesn't hinder, and doesn't help, we might as well sign.

But let’s suppose that **if you don't sign, they might not sign**.

But we have no evidence.

But in this case, since Player 1 will play A0 anyway, and you get 5, and signing doesn’t change that, **there is no reason not to sign**.

But here’s a better point: **under the contract, your minimum payoff is 5 (if you play A0)**.

In the original game, your minimum payoff is 3 (if both play A1).

But **you don't play A1** — so you get 5.

So no issue.

Therefore, **no change**.

But wait — **under the contract, if you choose to play A1, you get -2**, which is worse, but you won't.

So you are fine.

But **if you sign**, you are **committed** to the contract rules, but since you would choose A0 anyway, it’s safe.

So **signing is not harmful**.

And since it’s not harmful, and may help in coordination (though not needed here), you should sign.

Moreover, in many such games, signing a contract that improves coordination is beneficial.

But here, it doesn't change the outcome, but it **locks in** the good outcome.

Since you are guaranteed to get 5, and in original game you also get 5, but if there were any chance of (A1, A1), it would be worse, but there isn’t.

So conclusion: **signing is safe and harmless**.

But is there any **expected benefit**?

No — same payoff.

But since it’s not worse, and it might be part of a more stable equilibrium, but not needed.

However, **the original game has a mixed strategy equilibrium**.

But we are not told to play mixed strategies.

In practice, players usually play pure strategies.

So we assume (A0, A0).

So **both cases give 5**.

But let’s calculate expected payoff if you sign:

- If both sign (assume probability 1 that they sign, since they proposed): you get 5
- If they don’t sign: contract inactive, you get 5

So your expected payoff if you sign: 5

If you don’t sign: 5

So indifferent.

But the contract is **not active unless both sign**.

So to get the contract, you must sign.

But if you don’t sign, you are not party to it.

But since it doesn’t affect your payoff, you might as well sign.

But some might see signing as risky, but it’s not.

Therefore, **the safest answer is to sign**, because it doesn’t hurt.

But wait — what if the other player does not sign, and you sign, and then in the original game, you are not bound, but you might play A0, get 5 — same as not signing.

So no difference.

But.

Final decision: since signing does not reduce your expected payoff, and may be seen as a social good, but the problem is to maximize your points.

And since your points are the same either way, **you can sign or not**.

But the decision is binary.

And since there is no cost to signing, and no benefit, but the contract might be intended to be signed, and it's a way to ensure you play A0, but you would anyway.

Therefore, **signing is rational**.

Moreover, if you don't sign, and they do, then the contract is not active, but you still get 5.

But if you sign, and they do, you get 5.

So no issue.

But to be safe, **sign**.

But let’s consider a different angle.

Suppose you sign, and then the other player sees that you signed, and knows you will play A0 (because of dominant strategy), so they will play A0 → outcome (A0, A0) → you get 5.

If you don’t sign, they might think you might play A1, but they know you won’t.

So same.

But in summary, **your expected payoff is 5 either way**.

So you are indifferent.

But the problem is to **maximize your total points**.

So as long as you are not worse off, you can choose.

But the contract has **no downside**, so you should sign.

Final answer: **sign**

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0

response:
Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step, taking into account both the original payoffs and the **payment contract** that modifies the final outcomes.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game without the contract**

The original game is a coordination/competition game with the following payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| A0                   | (5,5)    | (0,3)    |
| A1                   | (3,0)    | (3,3)    |

So:
- If both choose A0 → (5,5)
- If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1 → (0,3)
- If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0 → (3,0)
- If both choose A1 → (3,3)

We are told: **You are Player 2**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract's effect**

The contract says:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, **drawn equally from the other players**.

Let’s parse this carefully.

- If **you** (Player 2) choose A0 → you get +4 points, **taken from Player 1** (since there are only two players).
- If **Player 1** chooses A0 → they get +4 points, **taken from you**.
- If a player chooses A1 → no additional payments.

So the **contract redistributes 4 points from the opponent to the player who chose A0**, **only if they chose A0**.

Thus, the **final payoff** for each player is:
- Original game payoff **plus** the contract bonus (if applicable).

Let’s recompute the **final payoff matrix**, with **Player 2's** payoff as the one we care about (you).

We’ll compute for each (Action by Player 1, Action by Player 2), the final payoffs for **Player 2**.

---

### **Step 3: Update the payoff matrix with contract effects**

Let’s denote:
- `P2_payoff = original payoff + (4 if P2 chose A0 else 0) - (4 if P1 chose A0 else 0)`

Because:
- If **P2** chooses A0 → P2 gets +4
- The 4 points are taken **from P1**, so P1 loses 4 → which affects P2's **net gain** only if P1 chose A0.

But from **P2's perspective**, the **total change** in their payoff due to the contract is:
- **+4** if P2 chose A0
- **-4** if P1 chose A0 (because P1 gets +4 and P2 loses it)

So for **P2**, the **net contract effect** depends on both choices.

Let’s make the matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2)                | A1 (P2)              |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|
| A0 (P1) | 5 + 4 (P2 gets +4) - 4 (P1 got +4) = 5 | 0 (P2's original) - 4 (P1 got +4) = -4 |
| A1 (P1) | 3 (P2) + 4 (P2 chose A0) = 7 | 3 (P2) + 0 = 3 |

Let’s do this one by one:

1. **P1 = A0, P2 = A0**:
   - Original: (5,5)
   - P2 chose A0 → +4
   - P1 chose A0 → P1 gets +4 → so **P2 loses 4** from contract
   - So P2's total: 5 + 4 - 4 = **5**

2. **P1 = A0, P2 = A1**:
   - Original: (0,3)
   - P2 chose A1 → no +4
   - P1 chose A0 → P1 gets +4 → so P2 **loses 4**
   - P2's total: 3 - 4 = **-1**

   Wait — this contradicts earlier. Let's clarify.

Hold on: **The contract is that if you choose A0, you get +4, drawn equally from other players.**

So the **4 points are taken from the other players**.

So:
- When P2 chooses A0 → P2 gets +4
- The source is from other players — here, only P1, so P1 loses 4.

Similarly:
- When P1 chooses A0 → P1 gets +4 → P2 loses 4.

So **P2's final payoff** = original payoff + (4 if P2 chose A0) - (4 if P1 chose A0)

That’s the correct formula.

Let’s recalculate:

---

### **Correct Final Payoff Matrix (for Player 2)**

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A0 (P1) | 5 + 4 - 4 = 5 | 0 + 0 - 4 = -4 |
| A1 (P1) | 3 + 4 - 0 = 7 | 3 + 0 - 0 = 3 |

So the **actual payoff matrix for Player 2** is:

| P1 \ P2 | A0   | A1   |
|--------|------|------|
| A0     | 5    | -4   |
| A1     | 7    | 3    |

Now let’s write it from Player 2’s perspective. You **choose** A0 or A1.

Let’s suppose you (Player 2) choose A0 with probability `p`, A1 with `1-p`.

Player 1 chooses A0 with probability `q`, A1 with `1-q`.

But both are choosing simultaneously — we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** under these payoffs, or at least a **best response for you**.

But the key is: **you are maximizing your own expected payoff**, and you know **the contract applies**.

Also, **Player 1 proposed the contract**, and it’s in effect. But that doesn’t change the game — it’s just part of the payoff structure.

We now need to **choose the optimal mixed strategy for Player 2**, given that Player 1 will also be rational and respond.

But here’s the critical point: **We do not know Player 1’s strategy**, so we need to **choose a strategy that maximizes our minimum expected payoff**, or find a **Nash equilibrium**, based on rational play.

Let’s find the **best response** for Player 2, assuming Player 1 is rational.

But to make this solvable, let’s try to find a **Nash equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 4: Find Nash Equilibrium**

We will look for a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let:
- Player 2 (you) choose A0 with probability `p` → A1 with `1-p`
- Player 1 choose A0 with probability `q` → A1 with `1-q`

Your expected payoff:
- If P2 chooses A0: `q * 5 + (1-q) * 7 = 5q + 7 - 7q = 7 - 2q`
- If P2 chooses A1: `q * (-4) + (1-q) * 3 = -4q + 3 - 3q = 3 - 7q`

Now, for you to be indifferent between A0 and A1 (in a mixed strategy equilibrium), these two must be equal:

> 7 - 2q = 3 - 7q  
> 7 - 3 = -7q + 2q  
> 4 = -5q → q = -0.8

That’s **impossible** — probability cannot be negative.

So **no mixed strategy equilibrium where you are randomizing**?

Wait — that suggests that **one strategy strictly dominates**.

Let’s look at the expected payoff from your choice as a function of `q`.

Let’s compare:
- E[A0] = 7 - 2q
- E[A1] = 3 - 7q

Now, is E[A0] > E[A1] for all `q` in [0,1]?

Check:
7 - 2q vs 3 - 7q  
(7 - 2q) - (3 - 7q) = 4 + 5q > 0 for all q ≥ 0

So **E[A0] > E[A1] for all q in [0,1]**.

So **A0 strictly dominates A1** for Player 2, **no matter what Player 1 does**.

Even if Player 1 chooses A0 with probability 1:
- E[A0] = 7 - 2(1) = 5
- E[A1] = 3 - 7(1) = -4 → worse

If Player 1 chooses A1 (q=0):
- E[A0] = 7
- E[A1] = 3 → still better

So **A0 gives a higher expected payoff than A1 for any q**.

Therefore, **the optimal strategy for you (Player 2) is to play A0 with probability 100%**.

Even though the contract gives you +4 when choosing A0, but **also imposes a -4 cost if Player 1 chooses A0**, the **net** effect is still favorable because:

- When P1 chooses A0: you get 5 (from 5 +4 -4), and this is better than -4 if you choose A1
- When P1 chooses A1: you get 7 (from 3+4), which is better than 3

So in **both cases**, A0 is better.

Therefore, **you should always choose A0**.

But wait — is there a downside?

Yes, **if you choose A0**, you are subject to the cost from Player 1 choosing A0 — but that’s already accounted for in the payoff.

But the **point is: even with that cost, A0 is still better**.

Let’s verify with numbers:

- If you play A0 for sure:
  - If P1 plays A0 → you get 5
  - If P1 plays A1 → you get 7
  - So your expected payoff: depends on P1’s choice, but **always ≥5**

- If you play A1 for sure:
  - P1 A0 → you get -4
  - P1 A1 → you get 3
  - So you can get -4 or 3 → expected could be low.

So **no matter what P1 does**, A0 is strictly better.

Therefore, **pure strategy A0 is optimal**.

Even if P1 is trying to minimize your payoff, you are guaranteed at least **min(5,7) = 5**, while A1 gives **min(-4,3) = -4** — so worse.

So, you should **always choose A0**.

---

### **Final Answer**

You should choose A0 with **100%** probability.

A1 with **0%**.

This satisfies:
- Sum = 100
- Valid JSON format
- Correct action names

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal strategy for **Player 2** (you) in this game, taking into account both the base payoffs and the **contract** that alters the final payoffs.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Payoff Matrix

The original payoff (before contract) is:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0       | A1       |
|------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                       | 5, 5     | 0, 3     |
| **A1**                       | 3, 0     | 3, 3     |

This is a symmetric-looking game but not quite. Let's analyze it carefully.

But note: You are **Player 2**, so when you choose an action, you're the "row" player, and the other player (Player 1) is the "column" player.

So the matrix from your perspective (Player 2):

- If you play A0:
  - vs A0 (P1 plays A0): you get 5
  - vs A1 (P1 plays A1): you get 0

- If you play A1:
  - vs A0: you get 3
  - vs A1: you get 3

So from your perspective (Player 2), your base payoff matrix is:

| Your Choice \ P1 Choice | A0 | A1 |
|---------------------------|----|----|
| A0                        | 5  | 0  |
| A1                        | 3  | 3  |

Now, consider the **contract**.

---

### Step 2: Apply the Contract Effect

The contract says:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 points, drawn **equally from the other players**.

Important clarification:
- The contract is in effect **for all players**.
- The "additional payment of 5 points" is **received by the player who chooses A0**.
- This 5 points comes **from the other player(s)**.

Since there are only two players, if **you** choose A0, you gain +5, and **Player 1** loses 5 (because the money is drawn equally from the others — i.e., from Player 1).

Similarly, **if Player 1 chooses A0**, they gain +5, and **you lose 5**.

> So now we need to adjust the base payoffs by including these contract effects.

Let’s compute the **total final payoffs** for **Player 2 (you)**, depending on your choice and Player 1’s choice.

We’ll derive the adjusted payoff matrix for **Player 2**.

---

#### Case 1: You choose A0, P1 chooses A0

- Base payoff (from game): 5
- You chose A0 → you get +5 from contract
- P1 chose A0 → P1 gets +5, so you lose 5 (the 5 is drawn from the other player)
→ So net: 5 (base) + 5 (from contract) - 5 (loss due to P1 choosing A0) = **5**

Wait! Let's think carefully here.

Who gets what?

- You (Player 2) choose A0 → you gain +5 from the contract.
- But this +5 is **drawn equally from the other player**, i.e., Player 1.
  → So Player 1 loses 5.

- Similarly, if Player 1 chooses A0 → they gain +5, which is taken from you (Player 2).
  → You lose 5.

So both effects apply simultaneously.

So in this case:
- You choose A0 → gain +5
- Player 1 chooses A0 → you lose 5 (because their A0 payment comes from you)

So net contract effect: +5 (from your A0) - 5 (because P1’s A0 cost you) = 0  
Base payoff: 5  
→ **Total: 5**

#### Case 2: You choose A0, P1 chooses A1

- Base payoff: 0
- You chose A0 → gain +5
- P1 chose A1 → no contract effect (they don’t get +5, and you don’t lose anything from them)
→ So contract effect: +5
→ Total: 0 + 5 = **5**

#### Case 3: You choose A1, P1 chooses A0

- Base payoff: 3
- You chose A1 → no contract benefit
- P1 chose A0 → they gain +5 → you lose 5
→ Contract effect: -5
→ Total: 3 - 5 = **-2**

#### Case 4: You choose A1, P1 chooses A1

- Base payoff: 3
- You chose A1 → no contract benefit
- P1 chose A1 → no contract benefit
→ Contract effect: 0
→ Total: 3

---

### Final Payoff Matrix for **Player 2 (You)**

| Your Choice \ P1 Choice | A0      | A1      |
|---------------------------|---------|---------|
| **A0**                   | 5       | 5       |
| **A1**                   | -2      | 3       |

Wow — this changes everything.

So regardless of what P1 does, if **you play A0**, you get **5** points.

If you play A1:
- if P1 plays A0 → you get -2
- if P1 plays A1 → you get 3

So clearly, **A0 dominates A1 for you**? Not exactly yet — because your probability distribution depends on what you believe P1 will do.

But note: **A0 gives you 5 no matter what**.

Whereas A1 gives you either -2 or 3, depending on P1.

So can we find a mixed strategy for P1 that makes you indifferent between A0 and A1?

But wait — in game theory, we usually assume rational players. So let’s consider that **you are trying to maximize your expected payoff**, given that **P1 is also optimizing their own payoff**.

But **we must be careful**: the contract is asymmetric in how it affects each player's incentives.

So far, we’ve computed the final payoff matrix for **Player 2 (you)**.

Now let’s compute the corresponding payoff matrix for **Player 1 (the other player)**.

Because P1 will choose based on their own incentives, and since your strategy depends on what you expect P1 to do, we need to know P1's payoff structure too.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Player 1’s Payoffs

Player 1 also has the same contract: if they choose A0, they gain +5 (from you), if they choose A1, nothing.

Base payoffs for **Player 1** (when you are Player 2):

| P1 Choice \ Your Choice | A0 | A1 |
|---------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                   | 5  | 3  |
| **A1**                   | 0  | 3  |

Now add contract effects:

#### Case 1: P1 chooses A0, you choose A0

- Base: 5
- P1 chose A0 → gains +5
- You chose A0 → you lose 5 → P1 gains 5 from you
→ Total: 5 + 5 = **10**

Wait — contract says: “if a player chooses A0, they receive +5 points from the other players.”

So when **P1 chooses A0**, they get +5 **regardless**, and this is drawn from the other player (i.e., you).

So: +5 bonus to P1.

Similarly, when **you choose A0**, you get +5, drawn from P1.

So both happen independently.

So in this case:
- P1 chooses A0 → +5
- You choose A0 → P1 loses 5 (because you get +5 from them)
→ Net: +5 - 5 = 0 extra
→ Total payoff: 5 (base) + 0 = **5**

Wait — that’s inconsistent with earlier logic.

Let’s clarify: **Is the contract applied as a direct transfer per action, or is it a one-time payment?**

Re-reading:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.

So when you pick A0 → you get +5, paid by the other player(s).  
When the other player picks A0 → they get +5, paid by you.

So these are **independent transfers**.

Thus:

#### For P1 when they choose A0:
- They get +5 from the contract
- This 5 is drawn from **all other players**
- Since only one other player (you), it’s drawn entirely from you → you lose 5

So yes — every time someone chooses A0, they get +5, and the other loses 5.

Therefore, in this case:
- You chose A0 → you lose 5
- P1 chose A0 → P1 gains 5

So net effect on P1: base payoff +5 (contract)

Thus:

#### Case 1: P1 A0, You A0
- Base: 5
- Contract: +5 (from their A0)
→ Total: 5 + 5 = **10**

But wait — doesn't the contract say the *other players* pay? Yes, but **the +5 is received by the one who chooses A0**, and it's paid by the others.

So if both choose A0:
- P1 gets +5 (from you)
- You get +5 (from P1)
- So overall, neither loses money — it cancels out?

No — that contradicts "drawn equally from the other players".

Let’s re-analyze the exact wording:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 5 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."

So when **a player chooses A0**, they get +5, and this +5 comes from **the other players**.

So:

- If **you choose A0**, you get +5, paid by P1 → P1 loses 5
- If **P1 chooses A0**, they get +5, paid by you → you lose 5

These are **separate payments**.

So **both events can happen simultaneously**.

So if both choose A0:
- You get +5 (from P1)
- P1 gets +5 (from you)
→ Net: both gain 5? But where does the money come from?

Ah — this leads to a **free money problem** unless the contract specifies **sources of funding**.

But according to the rule: **"drawn equally from the other players"**

So:
- When **Player X** chooses A0, they get +5, drawn equally from **all other players**.
- In a two-player game, "equally from the other players" means **entirely from the other player**.
- So: P1 gets +5 from you → you lose 5
- You get +5 from P1 → P1 loses 5

Therefore, **if both choose A0**, then:
- You gain +5 (from P1), but lose 5 (to P1) → net 0
- Similarly for P1: gain +5 (from you), lose 5 (to you) → net 0

That makes sense.

So the contract **net effect** is:
- If you choose A0: you get +5, but P1 loses 5
- If P1 chooses A0: P1 gets +5, but you lose 5

So the **net transfer** between you depends on who chooses A0.

Therefore, the **final adjustments** are:

For any outcome:
- If you chose A0 → you get +5, P1 loses 5
- If P1 chose A0 → P1 gets +5, you lose 5

So we can now correctly compute **Player 2's (your) total payoff** as:

**Final Payoff = Base Payoff + (5 if you chose A0) - (5 if P1 chose A0)**

Similarly, for Player 1:
**Final Payoff = Base Payoff + (5 if P1 chose A0) - (5 if you chose A0)**

This ensures symmetry.

Now apply this to each cell.

### Corrected Final Payoff Matrix for You (Player 2):

| Your \ P1 | A0         | A1         |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **A0**   | 5 + 5 - 5 = 5 | 0 + 5 - 0 = 5 |
| **A1**   | 3 + 0 - 5 = -2 | 3 + 0 - 0 = 3 |

Same as before.

And for Player 1:

| P1 \ You | A0             | A1             |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **A0**  | 5 + 5 - 5 = 5  | 3 + 5 - 0 = 8  |
| **A1**  | 0 + 0 - 5 = -5 | 3 + 0 - 0 = 3  |

Wait — let's verify that.

Case: P1 chooses A0, You choose A0  
- Base: 5  
- P1’s contract: gets +5 (from you)  
- You chose A0 → you lose 5 (to P1)  
→ So P1 gets +5 from contract  
→ Net: 5 + 5 = 10? No — because the +5 is drawn from you, which is already reflected.

Wait — no: the base payoff is **5**, and the contract gives P1 an **additional +5**, funded by you.

So yes: P1’s final payoff = base 5 + contract +5 = **10**  
But you lose 5 — which is consistent.

But in the previous matrix I said P1 gets 5 — that was wrong.

Wait — the base payoff is **5** (from the game), and the contract adds +5 → so total **10**.

Similarly:

#### Case: P1 A0, You A1
- Base: 3
- P1 chose A0 → +5 from contract → they get +5
- You chose A1 → no contract effect for you → P1 does not get extra from you
→ So P1 payout: 3 + 5 = **8**

#### Case: P1 A1, You A0
- Base: 0
- P1 chose A1 → no contract → no +5
- You chose A0 → you get +5 (funded by P1)
→ So P1 doesn’t get anything, but loses 5 → P1 final: 0 - 5 = **-5**

#### Case: P1 A1, You A1
- Base: 3
- No A0 chosen → no contract effects
→ P1 final: 3

So corrected matrix for **Player 1 (P1)**:

| P1 \ You | A0       | A1       |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 10       | 8        |
| **A1**  | -5       | 3        |

Wait — that seems extreme.

But let’s double-check:

- When P1 chooses A0, they always get **+5 from contract**, because they chose A0.
- And whoever chose A0 (including themselves?) — no, only **other players** pay.

So if **only P1 chooses A0**, then:
- P1 gets +5 (from you)
- You lose 5

Yes.

So in:
- P1 A0, You A0: P1 gets base 5 + +5 (contract) = 10
- P1 A0, You A1: base 3 + +5 = 8
- P1 A1, You A0: base 0 + 0 (P1 didn't choose A0) and P1 loses 5 (since you chose A0) → 0 - 5 = -5
- P1 A1, You A1: base 3, no contract → 3

Yes.

So **P1's payoffs** are very high when choosing A0 (10 or 8), and low (-5) if they choose A1 while you choose A0.

Hence, **P1 has strong incentive to choose A0**, unless they think you might also use A0.

Now back to **your** goal: maximize your expected payoff.

Your current payoff matrix:

| Your \ P1 | A0      | A1      |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **A0**   | 5       | 5       |
| **A1**   | -2      | 3       |

So if you play A0, you get **5 no matter what**.

If you play A1, you get:
- -2 if P1 plays A0
- 3 if P1 plays A1

But P1 is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff.

So we need to figure out **what P1 will do**, given their incentives.

---

### Step 4: Find P1’s Best Response

P1’s expected payoff depends on your strategy.

Suppose you play A0 with probability **p**, A1 with probability **1-p**.

Then P1’s expected payoff:

- If P1 plays A0:
  - vs You A0 (prob p): payoff 10
  - vs You A1 (prob 1-p): payoff 8
  → Expected: 10p + 8(1-p) = 10p + 8 - 8p = 2p + 8

- If P1 plays A1:
  - vs You A0 (prob p): payoff -5
  - vs You A1 (prob 1-p): payoff 3
  → Expected: -5p + 3(1-p) = -5p + 3 - 3p = -8p + 3

Now, P1 will choose A0 if:
- 2p + 8 > -8p + 3
→ 2p + 8 > -8p + 3
→ 10p > -5
→ p > -0.5

Which is always true since p ≥ 0.

So **2p + 8 > -8p + 3 for all p ∈ [0,1]**

Let’s check at p=0:
- A0: 8
- A1: 3 → A0 better
At p=1:
- A0: 10
- A1: -5 → A0 better

Even at p=0.5:
- A0: 2(0.5)+8 = 9
- A1: -8(0.5)+3 = -4+3 = -1 → still A0 better

So **no matter what you do**, P1 always strictly prefers A0.

Therefore, **P1 will choose A0 with probability 1**

---

### Step 5: Determine Your Optimal Strategy

Since **P1 will definitely play A0**, you face a known opponent.

So you can respond optimally.

From your payoff matrix:

- If you play A0: you get 5
- If you play A1: you get -2 (since P1 plays A0)

So clearly: **A0 gives you 5, A1 gives you -2**

Thus, you should **always play A0**

In fact, even if you weren’t sure, playing A0 guarantees you 5, while A1 risks -2 or 3 — but since P1 plays A0, the risk becomes certain.

So optimal strategy: **play A0 with probability 100%**

Therefore, your probability distribution:

- {"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

---

### Final Check

- P1 will play A0 (since it's dominant for them)
- If you play A0:
  - Base payoff: 5
  - You chose A0 → +5 from contract
  - P1 chose A0 → you lose 5 (contract cost)
  → Net: 5 + 5 - 5 = 5 ✅

- If you played A1 instead:
  - Base: 3
  - You didn’t choose A0 → no +5
  - P1 chose A0 → you lose 5
  → Net: 3 - 5 = -2 < 5 → worse

So indeed, A0 is best.

Even though both A0 and A1 give you 5 in some cases, when P1 plays A0, you only get -2 on A1.

So **no ambiguity**.

response:
To determine which contracts, if any, to approve, let's carefully analyze each contract and its implications on the game's payoffs.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Original Payoff Matrix:**
   Let's summarize the payoffs without any contract.

    |         | Opponent: A0 | Opponent: A1 |
    |---------|--------------|--------------|
    | You: A0 |       5, 5   |       0, 3   |
    | You: A1 |       3, 0   |       3, 3   |

2. **Evaluating Contract Proposed by Player 1:**
   - **Contract Rules:**
     - If a player chooses A0: No additional payments.
     - If a player chooses A1: They pay 2 points distributed equally among the other players.

   - **Modified Payoff Matrix:**
     |         | Opponent: A0 | Opponent: A1 |
    |---------|--------------|--------------|
    | You: A0 |       5, 5   |       0, 3   |
    | You: A1 |       2, 1   |       2, 1   |

     Breakdown:
     - A1 against A0: You: 3 - 2 = 1, Opponent: 0 + 1 = 1
     - A1 against A1: You: 3 - 2 = 1, Opponent: 3 - 2 + 1 = 2

3. **Evaluating Contract Proposed by Player 2:**
   - **Contract Rules:**
     - If a player chooses A0: They receive 4 points equally drawn from the other players.
     - If a player chooses A1: No additional payments.

   - **Modified Payoff Matrix:**
     |         | Opponent: A0 | Opponent: A1 |
    |---------|--------------|--------------|
    | You: A0 |       7, 3   |       2, -1  |
    | You: A1 |       1, 2   |       3, 3   |

     Breakdown:
     - A0 against A0: You: 5 + 2 = 7, Opponent: 5 - 2 = 3
     - A0 against A1: You: 0 + 2 = 2, Opponent: 3 - 2 = 1

Based on these evaluations, let's determine which contract is more beneficial for you:

- **Contract 1**: The penalty makes the payoffs less desirable when choosing A1 as opposed to A0, and it penalizes both players equally.
- **Contract 2**: Makes A0 significantly more rewarding against A0, but worse against A1. It skews heavily in favor of A0, encouraging both players to choose it in the hopes of achieving more points.

Since your goal is to maximize your total points, compare the rewards and risks.
- From the analysis we can see that Contract 2 overly incentivizes choosing A0, which may lead to both players frequently picking A0.
- While Contract 1 introduces a penalty shift, it balances the incentives between choosing A0 and A1.

**Optimal Approvals:**
After careful consideration, Contract 1 seems fairer and more balanced in this setup. Hence, we should approve Contract 1 only.

response:
To solve this problem, we need to evaluate how each contract affects the expected outcomes (points received) for both players involved in the game. Let's start with analyzing the original game without any contracts.

### Original Payoff Matrix

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & A0 & A1 \\
\hline
A0 & (5, 5) & (0, 3) \\
A1 & (3, 0) & (3, 3) \\
\end{array}
\]

### Evaluation of Contracts

#### Contract C1
Under Contract C1:
- Choosing A0 results in no additional payment.
- Choosing A1 results in an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally to the other player.

##### Adjusted Payoff Matrix for Contract C1

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & A0 & A1 \\
\hline
A0 & (5, 5) & (0, 4) \\
A1 & (4, 0) & (2, 4) \\
\end{array}
\]

##### Reasoning
- If both players choose A0, they each receive 5 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 0 points and Player 2 gets 4 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 4 points and Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If both players choose A1, Player 1 gets 2 points and Player 2 gets 4 points.

This contract makes the Player choosing A1 pay 2 points to the other player, thus making A0 more attractive if evenly split gains can be achieved.

#### Contract C2
Under Contract C2:
- Choosing A0 grants an additional 10 points from the other player.
- Choosing A1 incurs no additional payments.

##### Adjusted Payoff Matrix for Contract C2

\[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 & A0 & A1 \\
\hline
A0 & (15, -5) & (10, -7) \\
A1 & (5, 3) & (3, 3) \\
\end{array}
\]

##### Reasoning
- If both players choose A0, Player 1 gets 15 points, and Player 2 gets -5 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 10 points, and Player 2 gets -7 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 5 points, and Player 2 gets -7 points.
- If both players choose A1, both players get 3 points.

This contract heavily incentivizes choosing A0 but at the high expense of the other player, which may not be desirable in a cooperative context.

### Approval Decision

Considering that we aim to maximize our total points and likely maintain a balanced cooperative relationship:

- Contract C1 does present a slight redistribution effect that favors A0, but maintains overall fairness.
- Contract C2 creates a large incentive misbalance, heavily penalizing the player that doesn’t choose A0.

Thus:

```json
{
    "C1": true,
    "C2": false
}
```

response:
Let's break down the problem step-by-step to evaluate each proposed contract and determine whether to approve them.

### Step 1: Understanding the Basic Game Without Contracts

First, let's analyze the payoffs without any contracts:

| Your Choice | Other’s Choice | Your Payoff | Other’s Payoff |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| A0          | A0             | 5           | 5              |
| A0          | A1             | 0           | 3              |
| A1          | A0             | 3           | 0              |
| A1          | A1             | 3           | 3              |

### Step 2: Analyzing Proposed Contracts

- **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1):**
  - If a player chooses A0, there is **no additional payment**.
  - If a player chooses A1, they pay an **additional 2 points**, distributed equally among the other players.

    Let's calculate the new payoffs under this contract:

    | Your Choice | Other’s Choice | Your Payoff | Other’s Payoff |
    | ----------- | -------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
    | A0          | A0             | 5           | 5              |
    | A0          | A1             | 0           | 3 - 2/1 = 1    |
    | A1          | A0             | 3 - 2/1 = 1 | 0              |
    | A1          | A1             | 3 - 2/1 = 1 | 3 - 2/1 = 1    |

    The new payoffs are:

    - (A0, A0): You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
    - (A0, A1): You get 0 points, the other player gets 1 point.
    - (A1, A0): You get 1 point, the other player gets 0 points.
    - (A1, A1): Both get 1 point.

- **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2, yourself):**
  - If a player chooses A0, they **receive an additional 1 point** drawn equally from the other players.
  - If a player chooses A1, they pay an **additional 1 point**, distributed equally among the other players.

    Let's calculate the new payoffs under this contract:

    | Your Choice | Other’s Choice | Your Payoff | Other’s Payoff |
    | ----------- | -------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
    | A0          | A0             | 5 + 1/2 = 5.5 | 5 - 1/2 = 4.5 |
    | A0          | A1             | 0 + 1/2 = 0.5 | 3 - 1/2 = 2.5 |
    | A1          | A0             | 3 - 1/2 = 2.5 | 0 + 1/2 = 0.5 |
    | A1          | A1             | 3 - 1/2 = 2.5 | 3 - 1/2 = 2.5 |

    The new payoffs are:

    - (A0, A0): You get 5.5 points, the other player gets 4.5 points.
    - (A0, A1): You get 0.5 points, the other player gets 2.5 points.
    - (A1, A0): You get 2.5 points, the other player gets 0.5 points.
    - (A1, A1): Both get 2.5 points.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Contracts

As Player 2, you want to maximize your points:

- **Contract C1:** 
  - The payoffs for actions involving A1 are significantly reduced (1 point).
  - To maximize your points, you'd prefer A0 more strongly since A1 yields lower payoff.
  - This contract is less favorable as it reduces your maximum achievable payoff.

- **Contract C2:**
  - You gain an additional half point if you play A0.
  - Reduced points for playing A1, but still more favorable than the reductions in Contract C1.
  - This contract incentivizes you to play A0 more often, aligning with maximizing your payoffs while keeping A1 a viable strategy.

### Step 4: Approval Decision

Given your objective to maximize total points:

```json
{
    "C1": false,
    "C2": true
}
```

You reject C1 as it significantly reduces the payoff of action A1, and approve C2 as it improves your payoff structure more favorably.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.

response:
To determine which contracts to approve, we need to analyze the payoffs under each scenario considering both the original game rules and the additional payments outlined in the contracts. Let's break down each contract step-by-step:

### Base Payoffs
Let's first recall the payoffs without any contracts:

- Payoff Matrix:
    \[
    \begin{array}{c|c|c}
          & \text{A0} & \text{A1} \\
    \hline
    \text{A0} & (5, 5) & (0, 3) \\
    \text{A1} & (3, 0) & (3, 3) \\
    \end{array}
    \]

### Contract Proposals
#### Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payment.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points equally distributed among the other players.

What does this mean in terms of payoffs?

1. **A0 vs A0:** 
   - Player 1: 5 points
   - Player 2: 5 points

2. **A0 vs A1:** 
   - Player 1: 0 points
   - Player 2: 3 - 2/2 (1 point to Player 1) = 2 points

3. **A1 vs A0:** 
   - Player 1: 3 - 2/2 (1 point to Player 2) = 2 points
   - Player 2: 0 points

4. **A1 vs A1:**
   - Player 1: 3 - 2/2 = 2 points
   - Player 2: 3 - 2/2 = 2 points

Payoff Matrix with Contract C1:
\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
      & \text{A0} & \text{A1} \\
\hline
\text{A0} & (5, 5) & (0, 2) \\
\text{A1} & (2, 0) & (2, 2) \\
\end{array}
\]

#### Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):
- No additional payments regardless of the action chosen.

Payoff Matrix with Contract C2 remains the same as the base game.

### Evaluating Outcomes:
1. **Without Contracts:**
   - **Nash Equilibrium:** In this base game, (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium for mutual best response. Both players get 3 points each.

2. **With Contract C1:**
   - **Nash Equilibrium:** Incentivizes more play towards A0 because A1 now has an effective payoff reduction due to the penalty. (A0, A0) becomes more attractive with 5 points each.

   Comparing the outcomes:
   - (A0, A0) yields 5 points each, better than baseline.
   - (A1, A1) now yields only 2 points each.
   
3. **With Contract C2:**
   - (A1, A1) remains as an equilibrium with 3 points each.

Given the analysis, it is clear that contract C1 improves the overall points if players coordinate towards (A0, A0), which is a higher total payoff (10 points in total compared to 6 points in (A1, A1) without contracts).

### Final Decision:
- Approve Contract C1.
- Do not approve Contract C2 (since it does not improve the points over the base game).

Result in JSON format:
```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": false
}

response:
To make the decision on which contracts to approve, let's first analyze the payoffs with and without the proposed contracts. We'll use the game rules and payoffs provided as a basis.

### Basic Payoff Matrix (No Contracts)
Without any contracts, the payoffs can be summarized as:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### Contract 1 Analysis:
- If a player chooses A0, no additional payments are made.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points which are distributed to the other player.

Revised Payoff Matrix with Contract 1:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 4). (Player 2 gets 3 points for A1 and 1 point from Player 1 for A1 payment)
- (A1, A0): (1, 0). (Player 1 gets 3 points for A1, minus 2 points for A1 payment)
- (A1, A1): (2, 2). (Both players lose 2 points, earned 3 points, netting 1 point each)

### Contract 2 Analysis:
- If a player chooses A0, no additional payments are made.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point which is distributed to the other player.

Revised Payoff Matrix with Contract 2:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3.5). (Player 2 gets 3 points for A1 and 0.5 point from Player 1 for A1 payment)
- (A1, A0): (2.5, 0). (Player 1 gets 3 points for A1, minus 0.5 points for A1 payment)
- (A1, A1): (2.5, 2.5). (Both players lose 0.5 point, earned 3 points, netting 2.5 points each)

### Strategy Analysis
Without any contracts:
- The mutual preferred outcome is both selecting A0 (5, 5). 
- If strategic risk-taking is considered (choosing A1 hoping to face A0), it might harm total collective payoffs.

With Contract 1:
- The penalties for choosing A1 are quite high (paying 2 points), reducing the incentive to defect from mutual cooperation (both choose A0).

With Contract 2:
- The penalties for choosing A1 are lower (paying 1 point), making A1 still reasonably attractive based on opponent's potential choices.

### Decision-Making
Given the incentive structures, the higher penalty in Contract 1 more strongly discourages choosing A1, making mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) more attractive consistently. However, it's a personal preference on how much we deter using A1. The more stringent penalty in Contract 1 might be less flexible.

Thus, for our goal:
- **Contract 1 (C1)**: Strong penalties, strong push for mutual cooperation.
- **Contract 2 (C2)**: Moderate penalties, balance in keeping A1 as a viable option.

### Final Decision
To maximize and maintain stability in mutual cooperation, it might be practical to approve both, noting either avoids strictly higher risk:

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": true
}
```

Also, both contracts offer equilibrating mechanisms that structure payoffs into better cooperation-maintaining strategies.

The output should be:

```json
{
  "C1": true,
  "C2": true
}
```

response:
To tackle this problem, we need to evaluate each proposed contract based on how it affects our total points gained in the game.

Let's break down the analysis for each proposed contract:

### Basic Payoff Analysis Without Any Contract:
- If both players choose A0:
  - Player 1: 5 points
  - Player 2: 5 points
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 0 points
  - Player 2: 3 points
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 3 points
  - Player 2: 0 points
- If both players choose A1:
  - Player 1: 3 points
  - Player 2: 3 points

### Evaluating Each Contract:

#### Contract proposed by Player 1:
- Action A0: no additional payment for either player.
- Action A1: player pays 2 points distributed equally to the other player (thus the one paying loses 2 points, and the one receiving gains 2 points).

Payoff with Contract 1:
- Both choose A0:
  - Player 1: 5 points (no change)
  - Player 2: 5 points (no change)
- Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 0 points
  - Player 2: 3 points - 2 points (payment) = 1 point + 2 points (receiver) = 3 points
- Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 3 points - 2 points (payment) = 1 point + 2 points (receiver) = 3 points
  - Player 2: 0 points
- Both choose A1:
  - Player 1: 3 points - 2 points (payment) = 1 point + 2 points (receiver) = 3 points (net effect)
  - Player 2: 3 points - 2 points (payment) = 1 point + 2 points (receiver) = 3 points (net effect)

This contract does not change the total payoffs but incentivizes players to avoid choosing A1 because they incur an extra cost of 2 points.

#### Contract proposed by Player 2:
- Action A0: player receives an additional 2 points, drawn equally from the other player (the one choosing A0 gains 2 points at the expense of the other player losing 2 points).
- Action A1: player pays 2 points distributed equally to the other player (similar to Contract 1’s payment for A1).

Payoff with Contract 2:
- Both choose A0:
  - Player 1: 5 points + 2 points = 7 points (other player loses 2)
  - Player 2: 5 points + 2 points = 7 points (other player loses 2)
- Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 0 points + 2 points = 2 points
  - Player 2: 3 points - 2 points = 1 points
- Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 3 points - 2 points = 1 points
  - Player 2: 0 points + 2 points = 2 points
- Both choose A1:
  - Player 1: 3 points - 2 points = 1 points
  - Player 2: 3 points - 2 points = 1 points

Contract 2 thus disfavors choosing A1 heavily because you are punished both for yourself and your opponent is benefitting even more than without it.

### Conclusion:
- Contract 1 is approved as it maintains the overall cooperative potential but introduces a slight deterring penalty for A1, balancing choices.
- Contract 2 is disapproved because it significantly distorts the incentives, allowing a player to unduly shift points, creating an unfair advantage.

### Final Output in JSON:
```json
{
    "C1": true,
    "C2": false
}
```

To determine which contracts you should approve of, we need to analyze the impact of each contract on the payoffs in each scenario. 

### Basic Game Analysis without Contract
First, let's break down the basic payoffs without any contract:
- If both players choose A0, both get 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you get 0 points and the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, you get 3 points and the other player gets 0 points.
- If both players choose A1, both get 3 points.

### Evaluation of Contracts

#### Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there are no additional payments.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Under this contract, the payoff table changes as follows:
- If both players choose A0, both get (5 - 0) = 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, 
  - You get (0 + 1) = 1 point (since you don’t make a payment and receive 1 point from Player 2's payment).
  - The other player gets (3 - 2 + 1) = 2 points (3 points from base, minus 2 points payment, plus 1 point they receive from themselves).
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, 
  - You get (3 - 2 + 1) = 2 points (3 points from base, minus 2 points payment, plus 1 point from Player 2’s payment).
  - The other player gets (0 + 1) = 1 point (since they don’t make a payment and receive 1 point from your payment).
- If both players choose A1,
  - Both get (3 - 2 + 2) = 3 points (3 points from base, minus 2 points payment, plus 2 points they receive from each other).

In this contract, the best strategy (from a payoff maximization standpoint) would be for both players to choose A0.

#### Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional point of 1, drawn equally from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other player.

Under this contract, the payoff table changes as follows:
- If both players choose A0, both get (5 + 1 - 1) = 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1,
  - You get (0 + 2 - 1) = 1 point (since 0 from base and you receive 2 for A1, minus 1 point from Player 2’s payment).
  - The other player gets (3 - 1 + 1) = 3 points (3 points from base, minus 1 point payment, plus 1 point from their payment).
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0,
  - You get (3 - 1 + 1) = 3 points (3 points from base, minus 1 point payment, plus 1 point from Player 2’s payment).
  - The other player gets (0 + 2) = 2 points (since you don’t make a payment and receive 2 points).
- If both players choose A1,
  - Both get (3 - 1 + 1) = 3 points (3 points from base, minus 1 point payment, plus 1 point they receive from each other).

In this contract, the payoffs remain the same as the basic game if both choose A1, but if any player chooses A0, it benefits them slightly unless the other player chooses A0 as well.

### Decision
To maximize your points, you ideally want to both agree on a contract that most evenly allows for maximum potential:

- **Player 1's contract** seems to enforce a cooperative strategy where both players choosing A0 yields the most stable and highest payoff (5 points each).
- **Player 2's contract** does not change the inherent payoff structure much except making the A0 choice slightly better unless the other player still consistently chooses A1.

### Conclusion
Given this analysis, you should approve Player 1's contract and not approve Player 2's.

  "C1": true,
  "C2": false

response:
To make an informed decision about whether to sign the contract, let's break down the situation using the provided information and payoff rules.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Game without the Contract:**

   - **When both players choose A0:**
     - Payoff: Player 1 gets 5 points, Player 2 gets 5 points.

   - **When Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:**
     - Payoff: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.

   - **When Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:**
     - Payoff: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.

   - **When both players choose A1:**
     - Payoff: Both players get 3 points each.

2. **Analyze the Game with the Contract:**
   The contract modifies payouts by adding a payment of 1 point for choosing A0 and a penalty of 1 point for choosing A1.
   
   - **When both players choose A0:**
     - Player 1 gets 5 points + 1 (contract) = 6 points.
     - Player 2 gets 5 points + 1 (contract) = 6 points.

   - **When Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:**
     - Player 1 gets 3 points - 1 (contract) = 2 points.
     - Player 2 gets 0 points - 1 (contract) = -1 points.

   - **When Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:**
     - Player 1 gets 0 points - 1 (contract) = -1 points.
     - Player 2 gets 3 points + 1 (contract) = 4 points.

   - **When both players choose A1:**
     - Player 1 gets 3 points - 1 (contract) = 2 points.
     - Player 2 gets 3 points - 1 (contract) = 2 points.

3. **Comparison and Implications:**
   - Without the contract, choosing A0 is beneficial if both players cooperate (5 points each).
   - With the contract, choosing A0 becomes even more beneficial (6 points each).

   - Without the contract, choosing A1 when the other player chooses A0 gives the chooser an advantage (3 points versus 0).
   - With the contract, choosing A1 results in a penalty, lowering the payoff for non-cooperative actions.

   - The contract encourages mutual cooperation by rewarding A0 and punishing A1 more than the standard payoff matrix.

### Conclusion

Given the contract:
- Mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) is highly incentivized with a payoff of 6 points each.
- Non-cooperation scenarios are less appealing due to the penalties.

As Player 2, signing the contract seems beneficial as it promotes cooperative behavior and maximizes potential payoffs for both players.

### JSON Output

```json
{"sign": true}
```

This decision is reached by analyzing the payoffs with and without the contract, ensuring that the contract aligns both players’ incentives towards cooperation.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

response:
Let's break down the situation and examine our best option step by step.

### Initial Payoff Matrix
Based on the original game rules, the payoffs are:
1. If Player 1 (P1) chooses A0 and Player 2 (P2) chooses A0, both get 5 points.
2. If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1, P1 gets 0 points while P2 gets 3 points.
3. If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0, P1 gets 3 points while P2 gets 0 points.
4. If both choose A1, both get 3 points.

### With the Contract
Let's analyze the payoffs after taking the contract into account:
- Choosing A0 gives the player an additional 1 point but deducts 1 point from the other player.
- Choosing A1 requires the player to pay an additional 1 point to the other player.

#### Adjusted Payoff Matrix
Now, let's incorporate the effect of the contract:
1. If both choose A0:
  - P1's payoff: 5 (original) + 1 (contract) = 6
  - P2's payoff: 5 (original) + 1 (contract) = 6
2. If P1 chooses A0 and P2 chooses A1:
  - P1's payoff: 0 (original) + 1 (contract) = 1
  - P2's payoff: 3 (original) - 1 (contract) = 2
3. If P1 chooses A1 and P2 chooses A0:
  - P1's payoff: 3 (original) - 1 (contract) = 2
  - P2's payoff: 0 (original) + 1 (contract) = 1
4. If both choose A1:
  - P1's payoff: 3 (original) - 1 (contract) = 2
  - P2's payoff: 3 (original) - 1 (contract) = 2

### Comparing Strategies
Without contract:
- Mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) gives 5 points each, which is the highest for any equal distribution.
- Conflict (one choosing A0 and the other A1) leads to an asymmetrical payoff of 0 and 3.
- Mutual defection (both choosing A1) results in a subpar payoff of 3 points each.

With contract:
- Mutual cooperation gives each player 6 points, which is better than any outcome without the contract.
- Conflict results in a smaller spread (1 and 2) than without the contract (0 and 3).
- Mutual defection results in a worse outcome (2 each) than mutual cooperation.

### Decision Analysis
- Signing the contract and opting to cooperate (choosing A0) can lead to a mutually beneficial outcome of 6 points each, which is the highest possible outcome.
- The contract encourages cooperation since mutual cooperation improves both players' payoffs.
- Mutual defection or conflict worsens the payoffs.

### Conclusion and Response
Since the contract promotes the highest possible cooperative payoffs (6), I would opt to sign the contract to maximize my expected utility.

response:
To determine the optimal probability distribution over the available actions \(A0\) and \(A1\), we need to carefully consider both the payoffs from the game itself and the effect of the payment contract.

Below are the basic rules, the payoffs based on combinations of \(A0\) and \(A1\), and the additional effects of the payment contract:

### Basic Game Payoffs:
- If you choose \(A0\) and the other player chooses \(A0\): you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If you choose \(A0\) and the other player chooses \(A1\): you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose \(A1\) and the other player chooses \(A0\): you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If you choose \(A1\) and the other player chooses \(A1\): you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

### Additional Payment Effects:
- \(A0\) choice gives an additional 1 point to you and subtracts the same from the other player.
- \(A1\) choice subtracts 1 point from you and adds the same to the other player.

With the effects of the contract: 

#### Updated Game Payoffs:
- If you choose \(A0\) and the other player chooses \(A0\): you get \(5 + 1 = 6\) points, the other player gets \(5 - 1 = 4\) points.
- If you choose \(A0\) and the other player chooses \(A1\): you get \(0 + 1 = 1\) points, the other player gets \(3 - 1 = 2\) points.
- If you choose \(A1\) and the other player chooses \(A0\): you get \(3 - 1 = 2\) points, the other player gets \(0 + 1 = 1\) points.
- If you choose \(A1\) and the other player chooses \(A1\): you get \(3 - 1 = 2\) points, the other player gets \(3 + 1 = 4\) points.

### Analysis and Best Strategy:
To maximize my total points, the goal is to maximize my expected payoff. Given the dominated nature of the strategies and the operational updates:

- If I choose \(A0\) and the other player chooses \(A0\): I get 6 points.
- If I choose \(A0\) and the other player chooses \(A1\): I get 1 point.
- If I choose \(A1\) and the other player chooses \(A0\): I get 2 points.
- If I choose \(A1\) and the other player chooses \(A1\): I get 2 points.

It turns out the safest and highest average approach is always favoring A0 approach:
- To guarantee always highest or equivalent safe points, favor the selection of \(A0\).

### Distribution (Optimal JSON Output)
```json
{
  "A0": 100,
  "A1": 0
}
```
Choosing \(A0\) exclusively would balance to the highest guaranteed points combination over iterations with previous game and payment contract influences.

response:
To determine the optimal probability distribution for maximizing my points, I need to analyze both the game's basic payoffs and the additional contract rules. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Basic Payoff Structure without Contract:**
   - (A0, A0): (5, 5)
   - (A0, A1): (0, 3)
   - (A1, A0): (3, 0)
   - (A1, A1): (3, 3)
   
2. **Contract Impact on Payoffs:**
   - Under the contract, if a player selects A0, they receive an extra 1 point (total 1 point taken from the other player).
   - If a player selects A1, they pay an extra 1 point (total 1 point distributed to the other player).

   Modified payoff matrix considering the contract:
   - (A0, A0): (5 + 1, 5 + 1) = (6, 6)
   - (A0, A1): (0 + 1, 3 - 1) = (1, 2)
   - (A1, A0): (3 - 1, 0 + 1) = (2, 1)
   - (A1, A1): (3 - 1, 3 - 1) = (2, 2)

### Expected Payoffs Calculation:
I need to find the optimal probabilities \( p \) and \( q \) for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively where:
- \( p \): Probability Player 1 chooses A0.
- \( 1-p \): Probability Player 1 chooses A1.
- \( q \): Probability I (Player 2) choose A0.
- \( 1-q \): Probability I (Player 2) choose A1.

My expected payoff \( E_2 \) as Player 2 would be:
\[ E_2 = 6pq + 1p(1-q) + 2(1-p)q + 2(1-p)(1-q) \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ E_2 = 6pq + p - pq + 2q - 2pq + 2 - 2q \]
\[ E_2 = 6pq - pq - 2pq + p + 2q - 2q + 2 - pq \]
\[ E_2 = 3pq + p + 2 \]

To maximize \( E_2 \), I need to find the optimal value for \( q \) which depends on my opponent's strategy (\( p \)).

### Strategy Discussion:
Given that both players receive more points by cooperating (both choosing A0 more frequently), it encourages mutual cooperation. However, considering the need to balance strategy against exploitation, I need to approximate the other player's move.

### Optimal Distribution:
Assuming rational behavior and considering mutual benefit maximization, both players may choose bounds near equal opportunities for cooperation. Therefore, one balanced strategy for me is to consider \( q \approx 0.5 \) assuming the other player also does. Yet leaning slightly towards cooperation because the payoff for A0 is higher in a mutually cooperative framework.

### Final Decision:
Given the calculated understanding, a probability spread favoring cooperation but slightly balanced for deterrence will be as follows:

```json
{"A0": 60, "A1": 40}
```

This means there is a slightly higher probability of cooperation, maximizing mutual payoff under the given contractual constraints.

Let's analyze the given contracts and their implications on the game outcomes for each player.

### No Contract Scenario:
First, let's consider the payoff matrix without any contracts:

1. **If you (Player 2) choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A0:**
   - You get 5 points, Player 1 gets 5 points.
   
2. **If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:**
   - You get 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
   
3. **If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:**
   - You get 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
   
4. **If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A1:**
   - You get 3 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.

### Contract Analysis:

**Contract proposed by Player 1 (C1):**
- **If a player chooses A0:**
  - No additional payments in either direction.
  
- **If a player chooses A1:**
  - They pay an additional 3 points, distributed equally among the other players (1.5 points to each).

**Contract proposed by Player 2 (C2):**
- **If a player chooses A0:**
  - They receive an additional payment of 1 point, drawn equally from the other players (0.5 points from each).

- **If a player chooses A1:**
  - They pay an additional payment of 1 point, distributed equally among the other players (0.5 points to each).

Now let's consider how the payoff matrix changes with these contracts in place:

### Contract C1 Analysis (Proposed by Player 1):

1. **If you (Player 2) choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A0:**
   - You get 5 points (no additional payment).
   - Player 1 gets 5 points (no additional payment).

2. **If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:**
   - You get 0 points.
   - Player 1 gets 3 points - 3 points (A1 penalty) + 1.5 points (you receive as A1 penalty) = 1.5 points.

3. **If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:**
   - You get 3 points - 3 points (A1 penalty) + 1.5 points (you receive from Player 1 penalty) = 1.5 points.
   - Player 1 gets 0 points.

4. **If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A1:**
   - You get 3 points - 3 points + 1.5 points (A1 penalty from Player 1) = 1.5 points.
   - Player 1 gets 3 points - 3 points + 1.5 points (A1 penalty from you) = 1.5 points.

### Contract C2 Analysis (Proposed by Player 2):

1. **If you (Player 2) choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A0:**
   - You get 5 points + 1 point (A0 bonus) - 0.5 points (A0 bonus to Player 1) = 5.5 points.
   - Player 1 gets 5 points + 1 point (A0 bonus) - 0.5 points (A0 bonus to you) = 5.5 points.

2. **If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1:**
   - You get 0 points + 1 point (A0 bonus) - 0.5 points (A1 penalty to Player 1) = 0.5 points.
   - Player 1 gets 3 points - 1 point (A1 penalty) + 0.5 points (A0 bonus to you) = 2.5 points.

3. **If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0:**
   - You get 3 points - 1 point (A1 penalty) + 0.5 points (A0 bonus from Player 1) = 2.5 points.
   - Player 1 gets 0 points + 1 point (A0 bonus) - 0.5 points (A1 penalty to you) = 0.5 points.

4. **If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A1:**
   - You get 3 points - 1 point (A1 penalty) + 0.5 points (A1 penalty from Player 1) = 2.5 points.
   - Player 1 gets 3 points - 1 point (A1 penalty) + 0.5 points (A1 penalty from you) = 2.5 points.

### Decision:

To maximize my total points, I need to approve contracts that increase my payoffs:
- **Contract C1:** reduces the payoff significantly when choosing A1 due to the 3-point penalty.
- **Contract C2:** slightly adjusts payoffs but doesn't heavily penalize any choices, and it gives a slight advantage when choosing A0.

Considering the above analysis, I will approve **Contract C2** only.

### Final Output:

```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}
```

This setup provides me with maximal flexibility and potential point maximization in the game.

response:
Step 1: Baseline game (no contract)
- There are two pure Nash equilibria: **(A0, A0)** giving each 5, and **(A1, A1)** giving each 3.
- So without a contract, coordination failure can leave us stuck at 3 instead of 5.

Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (Player 1’s proposal)
- Rule: playing **A1** makes you pay 2 to the other player.
- Payoffs (Player 2 shown second):
  - (A0,A0): (5,5)
  - (A0,A1): (2,1)
  - (A1,A0): (1,2)
  - (A1,A1): (3,3)
- Best responses remain:
  - If other plays A0, best is A0.
  - If other plays A1, best is A1.
- So C1 still has **two equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1). It does **not** eliminate the bad 3-point equilibrium.

Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (Player 2’s proposal)
- Rules:
  - playing **A0**: you receive +2 taken from the other player
  - playing **A1**: you pay 2 to the other player
- Key resulting payoffs for Player 2:
  - If Player 1 plays A0: A0 gives 5, A1 gives -1 ⇒ choose A0
  - If Player 1 plays A1: A0 gives 4, A1 gives 3 ⇒ choose A0
- Thus under C2, **A0 strictly dominates A1**, so the **unique Nash equilibrium is (A0,A0)** with payoff **5** each.

Step 4: Voting logic
- Approving C1 in addition to C2 can only increase the chance that C1 is selected (e.g., ties), and C1 doesn’t improve equilibrium selection versus C2.
- So to maximize expected points, approve only C2.

Final approvals (JSON):

Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

To maximize the total points received as Player 2, let's analyze the base game and the proposed contracts.

### Payoff Analysis
The base payoff matrix $(P_1, P_2)$ is:
- **(A0, A0):** $(5, 5)$
- **(A0, A1):** $(0, 3)$ (P2 chooses A1; P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3)
- **(A1, A0):** $(3, 0)$ (P1 chooses A1; P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0)
- **(A1, A1):** $(3, 3)$

This is a coordination game with two Nash Equilibria: $(A0, A0)$ yielding $5$ points each, and $(A1, A1)$ yielding $3$ points each.

### Contract Analysis
**Contract 1 (C1):** If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points to the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** $(5, 5)$
- **(A0, A1):** $(0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1)$
- **(A1, A0):** $(3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2)$
- **(A1, A1):** $(3-2+2, 3-2+2) = (3, 3)$
Nash Equilibria are still $(A0, A0)$ and $(A1, A1)$. This contract does not significantly change the strategic outlook but makes the coordinated $(A0, A0)$ outcome slightly more reinforced.

**Contract 2 (C2):** If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
- **(A0, A0):** $(5-4+4, 5-4+4) = (5, 5)$
- **(A0, A1):** $(0+4, 3-4) = (4, -1)$
- **(A1, A0):** $(3-4, 0+4) = (-1, 4)$
- **(A1, A1):** $(3, 3)$
Under C2, A0 becomes a **dominant strategy** for both players.
- For P2: If P1 plays A0, $5 > -1$. If P1 plays A1, $4 > 3$.
- For P1: If P2 plays A0, $5 > -1$. If P2 plays A1, $4 > 3$.
C2 guarantees the $(A0, A0)$ outcome ($5$ points) and provides a safety net ($4$ points) even if the other player deviates to A1.

### Decision
Both contracts aim to steer the game toward $(A0, A0)$, which is the optimal outcome for both players. However, **C2** is superior because it transforms A0 into a dominant strategy, ensuring the players reach the $(5, 5)$ payoff more reliably than the base game or C1. Moreover, in C2, if the other player fails to coordinate (plays A1), you still receive 4 points, whereas in C1 you might receive as little as 1 point. While C1 is also better than nothing, in approval voting, it is strategic to approve both if they both lead to favorable outcomes. Given they both support the $(5, 5)$ outcome, approving both increases the likelihood that *some* contract is implemented.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let's break down the decision-making process step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure without the Contract
First, let's review the payoffs without any contract:
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 5 points, Player 2 gets 5 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.

### Step 2: Understand the Effects of the Contract
The contract introduces an additional payment for choosing A1:
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

This means:
- If Player 1 chooses A1, they pay 2 points, so their net payoff will be reduced by 2 points.
- If Player 2 chooses A1, they also pay 2 points, reducing their net payoff by 2 points.

### Step 3: Calculate New Payoffs with the Contract
With the payments included:
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 5 points
  - Player 2: 5 points

- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 0 points (A0) + 1 point (half of the 2-point penalty paid by Player 2) = 1 point
  - Player 2: 3 points (A1) - 2 points penalty = 1 point

- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0:
  - Player 1: 3 points (A1) - 2 points penalty = 1 point
  - Player 2: 0 points (A0) + 1 point (half of the 2-point penalty paid by Player 1) = 1 point

- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A1:
  - Player 1: 3 points (A1) - 2 points penalty + 1 point (half of the 2-point penalty paid by Player 2) = 2 points
  - Player 2: 3 points (A1) - 2 points penalty + 1 point (half of the 2-point penalty paid by Player 1) = 2 points

### Step 4: Compare Payoffs with and without Contract
- Without Contract:
  - (A0, A0): 5 points each
  - (A0, A1): 0 (P1), 3 (P2)
  - (A1, A0): 3 (P1), 0 (P2)
  - (A1, A1): 3 points each

- With Contract:
  - (A0, A0): 5 points each
  - (A0, A1): 1 (P1), 1 (P2)
  - (A1, A0): 1 (P1), 1 (P2)
  - (A1, A1): 2 points each

### Step 5: Making a Decision
The contract seems to encourage both players to avoid choosing A1, as it introduces penalties that reduce the benefits of deviant behavior (mutual cooperation seems better under this contract, even though it caps the payoff at 5 if both choose A0).

The main thing to consider is if both players sign the contract, it reduces the attractiveness of defection (choosing A1) and increases mutual cooperation.

Given the payoff structures and to maximize stable cooperation, it would be advantageous to sign the contract.

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to weigh the changes in payoffs due to the contract. By analyzing both the original and modified payoff matrix, we can decide on the optimal strategy.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. Original Payoff Matrix

The given payoffs in the game without any contract:
- If both choose A0: Both get 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: Both get 3 points.

#### 2. Introducing Contract

The contract introduces a payment of 2 points for choosing A1, equally distributed to the other player:
- If you choose A0, no additional payment.
- If you choose A1, you pay 2 points, which means each player receives a 1-point payment from the other.

#### 3. Adjusted Payoff Matrix with Contract

Let's adjust the payoffs considering the contract:
- If both choose A0: Both get 5 points. (No change)
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 1 point (0 + 1), the other player gets 1 point (3 - 2 + 1).
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 1 point (3 - 2), the other player gets 4 points (0 + 1 + 3).
- If both choose A1: Both get 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 points (since each pays 2 and receives 1 from the other).

Updated Payoff Matrix with Contract:
- (A0, A0): You get 5 points, other gets 5 points.
- (A0, A1): You get 1 point, other gets 2 points.
- (A1, A0): You get 1 point, other gets 4 points.
- (A1, A1): Both get 2 points.

### 4. Summary of Payoff Changes

#### Without Contract:
- Maximum payoff: 5 (A0, A0)
- Minimum payoff: 0 (A0 when the other chooses A1)

#### With Contract:
- Maximum payoff: 5 (A0, A0)
- Minimum payoff: 1 (A0 when the other chooses A1 or A1 when the other chooses A0)

### 5. Decision Analysis

- With the contract, playing A0 still maximizes the payoff and guarantees 5 points if both choose A0.
- The risk associated with playing A0 when other player chooses A1 drops from 0 to 1.
- With the contract, choosing A1 becomes less attractive since it reduces points to a max of 2.

Since the contract minimizes the loss associated with choosing A0 when others might choose A1 (from 0 to 1), and considering the high mutual payoff when both choose A0, it makes sense to sign the contract for better security and slightly improved outcomes with less variability.

### Final Decision:
Therefore, the rational decision would be to sign the contract.

response:
To maximize the total points received as Player 2, we first analyze the original game's payoffs (P1 action, P2 action):
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant, offering 5 points to both players, while (A1, A1) offers only 3 points.

Next, we evaluate the proposed contracts:
- **Contract 1 (C1):** If a player chooses A1, they pay 3 points to the other player.
  - (A0, A0): (5, 5)
  - (A0, A1): (3, 0)
  - (A1, A0): (0, 3)
  - (A1, A1): (3-3+3, 3-3+3) = (3, 3)
  Under C1, (A0, A0) remains the payoff-dominant equilibrium. If P1 chooses A1, P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 (both give 3). However, if P1 plays A0, P2 strictly prefers A0 (5 vs 0). This contract strongly encourages the (A0, A0) outcome.

- **Contract 2 (C2):** If a player chooses A0, they receive 4 points from the other player.
  - (A0, A0): (5+4-4, 5+4-4) = (5, 5)
  - (A0, A1): (0+4, 3-4) = (4, -1)
  - (A1, A0): (3-4, 0+4) = (-1, 4)
  - (A1, A1): (3, 3)
  Under C2, A0 becomes the strictly dominant strategy for both players. If P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 (5 > -1). If P1 plays A1, P2 still prefers A0 (4 > 3). This guarantees the (A0, A0) outcome, resulting in 5 points for Player 2.

**Comparison:**
Both contracts lead to an expected outcome of (A0, A0), which yields 5 points—the highest possible in any equilibrium. C2 is theoretically stronger because it makes A0 a dominant strategy, while C1 makes it a stronger Nash equilibrium than in the original game. Both are significantly better for Player 2 than the risk of coordinating on (A1, A1) or failing to coordinate in the original game.

Since both contracts facilitate the maximum payoff, Player 2 should approve both to ensure a contract is selected.

response:
Step 1: Baseline incentives (no contract)  
Your best response depends on what Player 1 does:
- If P1 plays A0: you prefer A0 (5 > 3).
- If P1 plays A1: you prefer A1 (3 > 0).  
So there are two pure equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), with (A0,A0) giving the higher payoff (5 each).

Step 2: Evaluate Contract C1 (P1’s proposal)  
Rule: choosing A1 costs you 3 and gives the other player +3.

Your net payoff matrix becomes:
- (A0,A0): 5
- (A0,A1): 0 + 3 = 3
- (A1,A0): 3 − 3 = 0
- (A1,A1): 3 − 3 + 3 = 3

So against either P1 action, A0 is at least as good as A1 (and strictly better if P1 plays A0). This pushes play to (A0,A0) with payoff 5 for you.

Step 3: Evaluate Contract C2 (P2’s proposal)  
Rule: choosing A0 gives you +2 taken from the other; choosing A1 makes you pay 2 to the other. These apply to both players simultaneously.

Your net payoff matrix becomes:
- (A0,A0): transfers cancel → 5
- (A0,A1): you get +2 (your A0) plus +2 (their A1 payment) → 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1,A0): you pay 2 (your A1) and also pay 2 (their A0 reward) → 3 − 4 = −1
- (A1,A1): payments cancel → 3

Here A0 strictly dominates A1 for you, so again play is driven to (A0,A0) with payoff 5 for you.

Step 4: Approval decision  
Both contracts (if selected) lead to (A0,A0) and give you 5 in equilibrium. Approving both cannot reduce your equilibrium payoff and weakly increases the chance that some incentive-aligning contract is selected (depending on how P1 votes).

Therefore: approve both.

## Step 1: Understand the Payoffs
We receive points based on the actions taken by both players. The payoffs without considering the contract are:
- (A0, A0): You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- (A0, A1): You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- (A1, A0): You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- (A1, A1): You get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

## Step 2: Consider the Contract
According to the contract, if a player chooses A1, they have to pay 2 points, distributed equally to the other player. This means:
- If I choose A1, I lose 2 points.
- If the other player chooses A1, I gain 1 point from the contract because the cost is shared equally.

Let's revise the payoffs:
- (A0, A0): You get 5 points. The other player gets 5 points.
- (A0, A1): You get 1 point (0 base + 1 from the other player’s contract payment). The other player gets 1 point (3 base - 2 payment).
- (A1, A0): You get 1 point (3 base - 2 payment). The other player gets 3 points (0 base + 1 from your contract payment).
- (A1, A1): You get 2 points (3 base - 2 payment + 1 from the other player’s payment). The other player gets 2 points (3 base - 2 payment + 1 from your payment).

## Step 3: Analyze the Strategies
To maximize our points, let's compare the outcomes logically:
- The highest payoff is (A0, A0) with 5 points for mutual cooperation.
- (A0, A1) and (A1, A0) each yield 1 point for us, which is not ideal.
- (A1, A1) gives 2 points each, which is better than outcomes like (A0, A1) or (A1, A0) but suboptimal compared to mutual (A0, A0).

## Step 4: Optimal Strategy
Given the analysis, the incentive is higher for choosing A0 because:
- Mutual cooperation (A0, A0) yields the highest consistent points.
- Choosing A1 either leads to fewer points or equivalent low points due to the contract costs.

Therefore, the optimal strategy would be to choose A0 definitively.

## Final Answer
To maintain a clear strategy and maximize our points, we will set our probability distribution to:
```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

This indicates that we choose A0 100% of the time. This should incentivize the other player to do the same for mutual maximum benefit under the given payoffs and contract.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

Let me analyze each contract and compare them to the base game.

### Base Game Analysis (No Contract)

The payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): I get 5, Other gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, Other gets 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, Other gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, Other gets 3

**Key issue**: No dominant strategy exists. I prefer A0 if they play A0, but A1 if they play A1. This creates a coordination problem with two Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) giving (5,5) or (A1,A1) giving (3,3). There's risk of miscoordination.

### Contract 1 Analysis

With the penalty of 3 points for playing A1:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) - no change
- (A0, A1): I get 0+3=**3**, Other gets 3-3=**0**
- (A1, A0): I get 3-3=**0**, Other gets 0+3=**3**  
- (A1, A1): Both pay and receive 3, net (3, 3)

**My payoffs**: 
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me 0 → A0 is better
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 3, A1 gives me 3 → Equal

**Result**: A0 weakly dominates A1 for both players. This guarantees the efficient equilibrium (A0, A0) with payoff **5 for me**.

### Contract 2 Analysis

With the reward of 4 points for playing A0:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) - both receive and pay 4, nets to zero
- (A0, A1): I get 0+4=**4**, Other gets 3-4=**-1**
- (A1, A0): I get 3-4=**-1**, Other gets 0+4=**4**
- (A1, A1): (3, 3) - no change

**My payoffs**:
- If other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → A0 is better
- If other plays A1: A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → A0 is better

**Result**: A0 strictly dominates A1 for both players. This also guarantees (A0, A0) with payoff **5 for me**.

### Decision

Both contracts:
1. Eliminate the coordination problem
2. Make A0 the dominant strategy
3. Guarantee the optimal outcome of 5 points for me

Since both contracts achieve the same beneficial result and maximize my expected payoff, I should approve both.

First incorporate the contract into your (Player 2) payoffs:

- If **you play A1**, you **pay 2** to the other player ⇒ your payoff is **-2** relative to the base game.
- If **Player 1 plays A1**, you **receive 2** from them ⇒ your payoff is **+2** relative to the base game.

So Player 2’s effective payoff matrix becomes:

- (P1 A0, P2 A0): \(5\)
- (P1 A0, P2 A1): \(3 - 2 = 1\)
- (P1 A1, P2 A0): \(0 + 2 = 2\)
- (P1 A1, P2 A1): \(3 - 2 + 2 = 3\)

Let \(r\) be the probability Player 1 plays A0.

Your expected payoff if you play:
- **A0**: \(5r + 2(1-r) = 2 + 3r\)
- **A1**: \(1r + 3(1-r) = 3 - 2r\)

To choose a mixed strategy that is optimal in equilibrium, we set these equal (so Player 1 is also indifferent in the symmetric situation):
\[
2 + 3r = 3 - 2r \;\Rightarrow\; 5r = 1 \;\Rightarrow\; r = 0.2
\]
So the Nash equilibrium mix is **A0 with 20% and A1 with 80%**.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
```
                Other Player
                A0      A1
You     A0      5,5     0,3
        A1      3,0     3,3
```

The base game has Nash equilibria at (A0, A0) giving (5,5) and (A1, A1) giving (3,3). The (A0, A0) outcome is better for both players but requires coordination.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (my proposal)

With Contract 1: Playing A1 costs 3 points paid to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) - no changes
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 3 = **3**, they get 3 - 3 = **0**
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 3 = **0**, they get 0 + 3 = **3**  
- (A1, A1): (0, 0) - both pay the penalty

This makes **A0 strictly dominant** for both players. The unique Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) with payoffs **(5, 5)**.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (Player 2's proposal)

With Contract 2: Playing A0 gains you 10 points from the other player.

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (5+10-10, 5+10-10) = **(5, 5)** - payments cancel
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 10 = **10**, they get 3 - 10 = **-7**
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 10 = **-7**, they get 0 + 10 = **10**
- (A1, A1): (3, 3) - no changes

Checking dominance:
- If other plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > -7)
- If other plays A1: I prefer A0 (10 > 3)

This also makes **A0 strictly dominant** for both players. The unique Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0) with payoffs **(5, 5)**.

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

Both contracts achieve the same equilibrium result:
- **Contract 1**: (A0, A0) with (5, 5) ✓
- **Contract 2**: (A0, A0) with (5, 5) ✓  
- **No contract**: Could result in either (A0, A0) or (A1, A1)

Both contracts guarantee the optimal cooperative outcome by making A0 a dominant strategy. While Contract 2 has more extreme off-equilibrium payoffs, under rational play both contracts ensure I receive 5 points.

Since both contracts lead to the same desirable outcome, I should approve both.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs

As Player 2, my payoffs are:
- Both play A0: I get 5
- I play A0, opponent plays A1: I get 0  
- I play A1, opponent plays A0: I get 3
- Both play A1: I get 3

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs under each contract

**Under Contract 1 (penalty of 2 for playing A1):**
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 2 = **2**, opponent gets 3 - 2 = 1
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 2 = **1**, opponent gets 0 + 2 = 2
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

**Under Contract 2 (penalty of 1 for playing A1):**
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 1 = **1**, opponent gets 3 - 1 = 2
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 1 = **2**, opponent gets 0 + 1 = 1  
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

## Step 3: Analyze the mixed strategy equilibrium

For the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, I calculate the indifference conditions:

**Under C1:** 
- I play A0 with probability 0.4
- Opponent plays A0 with probability 0.2
- Expected payoff: 2.6

**Under C2:**
- I play A0 with probability 0.2
- Opponent plays A0 with probability 0.4
- Expected payoff: 2.6

## Step 4: Compare from my perspective

The key difference: 
- **C1** makes me more compelled to play A0 (opponent only plays A0 20% of the time)
- **C2** makes my opponent more likely to play A0 (40% vs 20%)

Since I get higher payoffs when my opponent plays A0, **C2 is strategically better for me**. It incentivizes my opponent to cooperate more while being less punishing to me if I need to play A1.

Additionally, C2 gives me better protection: when opponent plays A0 and I deviate to A1, I get 2 under C2 vs only 1 under C1.

Looking at this problem, I need to analyze how each contract changes the game and determine which ones benefit me.

## Step 1: Understand the original game without contracts

Base payoffs for me (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points  
- (A1, A0): 3 points
- (A1, A1): 3 points

This game has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 - the best outcome
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 - a safe but inferior outcome

The problem is coordination - without guarantee, there's risk of landing in the worse equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (my proposal)

With payments added:
- (A0, A0): I get 5, other gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 3 = **3**, other gets 3 - 3 = 0
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 3 = **0**, other gets 0 + 3 = 3  
- (A1, A1): I get 3 - 3 + 3 = **3**, other gets 3 - 3 + 3 = 3

My payoffs: A0 gives me {5 or 3}, A1 gives me {0 or 3}

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - it's always at least as good and sometimes better. The same holds for the other player.

Result: Unique Nash equilibrium at (A0, A0) → I get **5 points**

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (Player 2's proposal)

With payments added:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 + 2 - 2 = **5**, other gets 5 + 2 - 2 = 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 2 + 2 = **4**, other gets 3 - 2 - 2 = -1
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 2 - 2 = **-1**, other gets 0 + 2 + 2 = 4
- (A1, A1): I get 3 - 2 + 2 = **3**, other gets 3 - 2 + 2 = 3

My payoffs: A0 gives me {5 or 4}, A1 gives me {-1 or 3}

**A0 strictly dominates A1** again.

Result: Unique Nash equilibrium at (A0, A0) → I get **5 points**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

| Scenario | Expected Outcome | My Payoff |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| No contract | Risk of (A1,A1) equilibrium | 3-5 points |
| Contract 1 | Guaranteed (A0,A0) | 5 points |
| Contract 2 | Guaranteed (A0,A0) | 5 points |

Both contracts:
- Eliminate the coordination problem
- Make A0 the dominant strategy for both players
- Guarantee the optimal outcome of 5 points for me

Since both contracts lead to the same equilibrium payoff (5 points) which is the maximum possible, and both are strictly better than risking the no-contract game, I should approve both.

Let's go through this step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game with two players. Each chooses an action: A0 or A1, with some probability.

The payoffs (as given) are:

| Your Action | Other's Action | Your Payoff | Other's Payoff |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| A0          | A0             | 5           | 5              |
| A0          | A1             | 0           | 3              |
| A1          | A0             | 3           | 0              |
| A1          | A1             | 3           | 3              |

You are playing as **Player 2**.

Let’s analyze the **best responses** and **Nash equilibria** in the base game.

#### **Best Response Analysis (from Player 2’s perspective):**

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p).

Then, your expected payoff for choosing:
- **A0**:  
  = p * 5 + (1-p) * 0 = 5p
- **A1**:  
  = p * 3 + (1-p) * 3 = 3

Set equal to find indifference: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So:
- If p < 0.6 → A0 is better
- If p > 0.6 → A1 is better
- If p = 0.6 → indifferent

Similarly, analyze for Player 1 (the other player), but since we’re in the role of Player 2, we are focused on strategies that maximize **our** payoff.

But notice: There is **no symmetric pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.
- (A0, A0): both get 5. If you deviate to A1, you get 3 < 5 → not profitable.
  But wait: if Player 1 plays A0, then Player 2 choosing A1 gives you 3 → worse than 5.
  So (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium? Wait:
  - Player 1: if Player 2 plays A0, then Player 1 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so prefers A0.
  - Player 2: same. So yes, (A0,A0) is Nash.

Now check (A1,A1): both get 3. If you deviate to A0 while other plays A1:
- You get 0, which is worse → so no incentive to deviate.
  But wait: if you play A0 and other plays A1 → you get 0 → worse than 3 → no incentive.
  So (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium?

Wait — check:
- If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2's payoff:
  - A0 → 0
  - A1 → 3 → so prefers A1.
- Similarly, Player 1 prefers A1 if Player 2 plays A1.
→ So (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

Now check (A0,A1): you are Player 2, so if you play A0, other plays A1 → you get 0. But if you deviate to A1 → you get 3 → better → so not equilibrium.

Similarly, (A1,A0): you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 3. If you deviate to A0 → you get 5 → better → not equilibrium.

So two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Also, there is a mixed strategy equilibrium when p = 0.6 (Player 1 plays A0 with 0.6), then Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 only at that point.

But since the game is symmetric in structure (except for labeling), the pure equilibria are the main candidates.

So in the base game:
- (A0,A0): both get 5 → best outcome for both
- (A1,A1): both get 3 → worse
- (A0,A1): you get 0, enemy gets 3
- (A1,A0): you get 3, enemy gets 0

So both players prefer (A0,A0) over (A1,A1), but coordination is the problem.

Now **you are Player 2**, and the challenge is to **maximize your own total points**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract System**

Now a **payment contract** can be introduced via **approval voting**.

- **Two contracts** proposed:
  - **C1 (by Player 1)**: If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points **to the other player**, equally distributed. But it says “distributed equally among the other players” — but only one other player — so the entire 2 points go to the other player.
    - So: if you play A1, you **pay 2 points to the other player**
    - If you play A0: no payment
  - **C2 (by Player 2)**: No payments for either action. So nothing changes.

Note: The contract is applied **to both players**, and the payment is **in addition** to the base payoff.

So for example, under **C1**:
- If you play A1, you pay 2 to the other player → your total payoff is (base payoff) - 2
- The other player gains +2 from that payment

Let’s recompute the **new payoff matrix**, **under C1**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Payoffs Under Contract C1**

Assume **C1 is in effect**.

Remember: C1 is proposed by **Player 1**, and we are **Player 2**.

The contract says:
> If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points to the other player.

So:
- The **payer** loses 2
- The **receiver** gains 2

Let’s build the matrix **from your perspective (Player 2)**.

| Your Action | Other (Player 1) Action | Base Payoff | Payment Adjustment (you pay 2 if you play A1) | Total Payoff |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| A0          | A0                       | 5           | 0                                             | 5            |
| A0          | A1                       | 0           | 0 (you don’t play A1)                         | 0            |
| A1          | A0                       | 3           | -2 (you played A1) → pay 2 → lose 2            | 1            |
| A1          | A1                       | 3           | -2 (you played A1) → lose 2                   | 1            |

Important: When you play A1, you get **-2 from the contract**, regardless of what the other player does.

Now fill in the table:

| You \ Opponent | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **A0**         | 5       | 0       |
| **A1**         | 1       | 1       |

Now, let’s find **best responses**.

If Player 1 plays A0:
- You: A0 → 5; A1 → 1 → prefer A0

If Player 1 plays A1:
- You: A0 → 0; A1 → 1 → prefer A1

So no strict dominance.

Now, what is the mixed strategy equilibrium?

Let p = probability Player 1 plays A0.

Your expected payoff:
- A0: p×5 + (1-p)×0 = 5p
- A1: p×1 + (1-p)×1 = 1

Set equal: 5p = 1 → p = 0.2

So:
- If Player 1 plays A0 with p > 0.2 → you prefer A0
- p < 0.2 → you prefer A1

In equilibrium, you make Player 1 indifferent.

Let q = probability you play A0.

Player 1’s payoff:
- If P1 plays A0: you get 5 if P1 plays A0 → P1 gets 5
  - But you play A0 with q, A1 with (1-q)
  - So if P1 plays A0: their payoff = q×5 + (1-q)×3? No — we need to compute P1’s payoffs.

Wait: we need to compute **Player 1’s** payoff under C1.

Recall: **C1 is active**, so **whenever a player plays A1, they pay 2 to the other player**.

So from **Player 1’s perspective**:

| P1 \ You | A0       | A1       |
|----------|----------|----------|
| A0       | 5        | 0        |
| A1       | 3 - 2 = 1 | 3 - 2 = 1 |

Wait — let’s do it carefully.

Player 1:
- If P1 plays A0:
  - You play A0 → P1 gets 5 (base) + 0 (no payment)
  - You play A1 → P1 gets 3 (base) → but you played A1, so P1 pays 2 to you? No!
  - Wait: **Player 1 pays 2 only when *they* play A1.**

So:
- When P1 plays A0: no payment from P1 → P1's payoff = base
- When P1 plays A1: P1 pays 2 to the other player

So:

| P1 \ You | A0 | A1 |
|----------|----|----|
| **A0**   | 5  | 3  |
| **A1**   | 3 - 2 = 1 | 3 - 2 = 1 |

So P1’s payoff matrix:
- A0: 5 (if you play A0), 3 (if you play A1)
- A1: 1 (if you play A0), 1 (if you play A1) → always 1

Now, if P1 plays A1, they always get 1, regardless of your action.

If P1 plays A0, they get 5 if you play A0, 3 if you play A1.

So P1 **never** wants to play A1? Because A1 gives only 1, while A0 gives at least 3, and up to 5.

So **P1’s dominant strategy under C1 is A0**.

They **will never play A1** — because A1 gives only 1, while A0 gives 3 or 5.

So rational P1 will play A0.

Then, if P1 plays A0, what do you (Player 2) do?

From your perspective:
- You play A0 → get 5
- You play A1 → get 1

So you prefer A0.

Thus, **under C1, the unique Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**.

And you get **5 points**.

Compare to base game, where (A0,A0) is possible (but only if both coordinate), but (A1,A1) is also an equilibrium.

But under C1, the **only rational equilibrium** is (A0,A0) — because A1 is dominated for both players.

So C1 forces coordination on the best outcome: (A0,A0)

Your payoff: 5

Now, what about **C2**?

C2 (by Player 2): **no payments** → so this is **identical to the base game**.

So under C2, you and the other player can end up in any equilibrium: (A0,A0) → 5, or (A1,A1) → 3, or (A0,A1) → 0, or (A1,A0) → 3.

But since C2 is the status quo, outcomes depend on coordination.

Now, **you are deciding whether to *approve* each contract**.

The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So your goal is to **maximize the expected payoff conditional on the contract being selected**.

But note: the only way a contract gets selected is if it has **the most approvals**.

So you want to **approve contracts that increase your expected payoff**, and **only approve those that are beneficial or neutral**, to help them win.

Let’s analyze:

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate C1 (Proposed by Player 1)**

- Under C1: **you get 5 in equilibrium** (because (A0,A0) is the only Nash equilibrium)
- Under C1: A1 is dominated → so both players will play A0
- So you **get 5 for sure** under C1
- This is **better than** the best outcome in C2 if coordination fails
- In C2, you might end up at (A1,A1) → only 3, or (A0,A1) → 0

So you **prefer C1 to C2** in terms of payoff guarantee.

But: **C1 is proposed by Player 1**.

You are Player 2.

If you **approve C1**, and Player 1 also approves it (they did, since they proposed it), then C1 gets 2 approvals.

C2: proposed by Player 2 (you), so you approve it → at least 1 approval.

If you **approve C1**, then C1 gets 2 approvals → wins.

If you **don’t approve C1**, then C1 gets only 1 approval (Player 1), C2 gets 1 approval (you) → tie → **random selection** between them.

So your **expected payoff** depends on your decision.

Let’s compute expected payoff:

---

### **Case 1: You approve C1**

Then:
- C1: approvals = 2 (you + Player 1) → **wins**
- You get 5

→ **Expected payoff: 5**

---

### **Case 2: You do NOT approve C1**

Then:
- C1: only 1 approval (Player 1)
- C2: you approve → 1 approval (Player 2)
- Tie → random selection: each has 50% chance of winning

Then:
- With 50%: C1 wins → you get 5
- With 50%: C2 wins → you get **expected payoff in base game**

Now, **what is your expected payoff under C2 (base game)**?

In the base game, there are two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Assuming both players are rational and will play a Nash equilibrium, but coordination is difficult.

But if players are symmetric and rational, they might coordinate on (A0,A0) due to Pareto superiority.

Alternatively, they might end up on (A1,A1), which is less efficient.

But in standard game theory, without communication, it’s ambiguous.

However, since you are trying to **maximize your own total points**, and assuming **players will play a Nash equilibrium**, but you don’t know which one.

So expected payoff under C2:
- If both coordinate on (A0,A0): 5
- If both coordinate on (A1,A1): 3

But is there any reason to prefer one?

Note: If you play a mixed strategy, you can do better?

But to be safe, assume **cooperative expectations**: players will coordinate on the **Pareto optimal** outcome.

Why? Because (A0,A0) gives 5 to both — better than (A1,A1)’s 3.

Also, in real-world experiments, players often coordinate on (A0,A0) in such games.

So if we assume **rational players** will coordinate on the **best outcome**, then **C2 will lead to 5**.

But the problem doesn’t specify anything about coordination.

But since the question is about **your decision**, and you are trying to maximize **your** total points, you might assume **other player is rational** and will also want to coordinate on (A0,A0).

But if both players are trying to get 5, and both play A0, it works.

But what if one of you plays A1?

But in equilibrium, it’s stable.

Given that (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium and Pareto superior, it is **the likely outcome** in the base game, assuming coordination.

In fact, it is the **risk-dominant** equilibrium in many such games.

So let’s assume: **under C2, you get 5**

Then:

- If you **don’t approve C1**, then:
  - 50%: C1 wins → 5
  - 50%: C2 wins → 5
  - → Expected payoff: **5**

But wait — is that true?

Is C2 really going to yield 5?

Suppose both players are symmetric and rational.

Then if you believe the other player will coordinate on (A0,A0), you will play A0.

If you believe they will play A1, you may still play A0 (since A0 gives 5 vs 0 if they play A1).

But if they play A1, you get 0.

But you can reason: if they play A1, you get 0, so you prefer to play A0 → but then you get 0.

Wait — no: if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

If you play A1 and they play A1, you get 3.

So if you believe they play A1, you prefer A1 (3 > 0)

So no dominant strategy.

But if both believe the other will play A0, then both play A0 → 5

If both believe the other will play A1, both play A1 → 3

So **two stable equilibria**.

But unless there is communication, how do they coordinate?

In such games, **(A0,A0)** is more likely to be selected, because it's the best outcome.

But strictly speaking, without coordination, the **expected payoff** is ambiguous.

But suppose the players are rational and play **symmetric mixed strategies**.

Let’s compute the symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium in the base game.

Let each player play A0 with probability q.

Player 2’s expected payoff:

- A0: q×5 + (1-q)×0 = 5q
- A1: q×3 + (1-q)×3 = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 0.6

So in mixed strategy equilibrium: each plays A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4

Then your expected payoff:
- Always 3 (since indifferent), so **3**

But wait — you get 3 in equilibrium.

But **you can do better** by playing pure A0 if you believe the other will play A0 with high probability.

But if you are not sure, you might not want to risk.

But the question is: what is the **expected payoff under C2**?

If we assume players will **coordinate on the most efficient equilibrium**, then 5.

If we assume **mixed strategy equilibrium**, then 3.

But note: you are trying to **maximize your total points** — and the game is about **your own strategy** and **contract approval**.

But the contract outcome is **random** only if tied.

But since we are deciding on approval, and the winning contract is chosen randomly from those with max approvals, we must estimate the **expected payoff under each scenario**.

To maximize your expected payoff, you need to decide.

But let’s look at **C1 vs C2**:

- **C1**: forces (A0,A0) → you get 5 for sure
- **C2**: if you believe coordination will happen → you get 5
  But if not, you might get 3 (mixed eq), or even lower

But **C1 guarantees 5**, while C2 does not.

So **C1 is strictly better**.

Now, if you **approve C1**, then C1 wins for sure → you get 5.

If you **do not approve C1**, then C1 has only 1 approval (Player 1), C2 has 1 (you), tie → random → 50% chance of C1 (5), 50% chance of C2.

But what if C2 yields only 3 (mixed strategy), then your expected payoff is:
- 0.5×5 + 0.5×3 = 4

Which is **worse than 5**

Even if C2 gives 5 (coordination), then:
- 0.5×5 + 0.5×5 = 5 → same as approving C1

So in that case, **same expected payoff**.

But **C1 guarantees 5**, while C2 **only possibly gives 5**

Moreover, if C2 gives less than 5, C1 is strictly better.

So **approving C1 is always at least as good, and strictly better if C2 yields less than 5**

Therefore, **you should approve C1**.

Now, what about **C2**?

C2 is the status quo — no contract.

You are asked to approve it.

But if you approve C1, then C1 will win (since 2 approvals), so C2 won’t be selected.

But **you are not required to approve both**.

You can approve one or both.

But let’s see:

If you approve **both** C1 and C2:

- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 2 approvals
- So both have same max (2) → random selection between C1 and C2 → 50% chance of each

Then your expected payoff:
- C1: 5
- C2: depends
  - If C2 yields 5 → 0.5×5 + 0.5×5 = 5
  - If C2 yields 3 → 0.5×5 + 0.5×3 = 4 < 5

So unless C2 gives 5 for sure, this is risky.

But **you don’t know what C2 yields**.

But earlier we argued C1 is **guaranteed** 5.

C2 is **uncertain**.

So if you approve both, you risk getting only 3 with 50% chance.

But if you approve **only C1**, then C1 wins for sure → you get 5.

If you approve **neither**, then:
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 1 approval
- tie → random → expected 50% chance of C1 (5) and 50% chance of C2 (say 3 or 5) → worse.

So best is to **approve C1 only**.

Now, the question is: **should you approve C2?**

C2 is proposed by you (Player 2). But if you approve C2, you are just saying “I accept the status quo”.

But since C1 is better (guarantees 5), and C2 may give less, **you don’t want to help C2 win**.

In fact, if you approve C2, you increase C2’s approval count.

But if C1 already has 2 approvals (you + P1), then C2 has only 1 → C1 wins.

But if you **do not approve C1**, C1 has only 1 (P1), C2 has 1 (you), so tie → both have chance.

So if you **approve C2 but not C1**, then:
- C1: 1
- C2: 1 → tie → 50% chance of each

Then your expected payoff:
- 0.5×5 (if C1 wins) + 0.5×(payoff from C2)

Payoff from C2: let’s assume **at least 3** (mixed strategy), maybe 5 if coordination.

But even if we assume **C2 yields 5**, then:
- Expected payoff: 0.5×5 + 0.5×5 = 5

Same as approving C1.

But **you have no advantage** in approving C2.

In fact, if you approve C1, you get **guaranteed 5**

If you approve C2 only, you get **50% chance of 5 and 50% of 5** → still 5

But **better to guarantee 5** than risk it.

Wait — if you approve **only C1**, then C1 wins → you get 5.

If you approve **only C2**, then tie → 50% C1 (5), 50% C2 (5) → expected 5

Same.

But what if C2 yields **less than 5**? Then approving only C2 gives **expected < 5**

Whereas approving only C1 gives **exactly 5**

Therefore, **approving only C1 is strictly better** if C2 yields less than 5.

Thus, to be safe, you should **approve C1 and not approve C2**.

Now, is there any reason to approve C2?

Only if C2 gives **more** than 5 — but it cannot — max is 5.

So **C2 is strictly worse or equal**.

Therefore, you should **approve C1 and disapprove C2**.

---

### **Final Decision:**

- **C1**: approve → yes → because it guarantees 5
- **C2**: do not approve → because it's worse or equal, and risks lower payoff if you approve only C2

Thus, you approve only C1.

Now, let’s confirm the output format.

> {"C1": true, "C2": false}

But wait — you are Player 2, and C2 is **proposed by Player 2**.

Does that influence your decision?

The game is about **your own payoff**, so you should approve only if it benefits you.

Approving C2 doesn’t hurt, but it’s only useful if it helps C2 win, but since C1 is better, you don’t want that.

So **no, don’t approve C2**.

---

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P1
response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether we should sign the contract.

1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix without Contract:**
    - If both players choose A0: Each gets 5 points.
    - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
    - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
    - If both players choose A1: Each gets 3 points.

2. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix with Contract:**
    - If both players choose A0: Each gets 5 points.
    - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 - 1/2 = 2.5 points.
    - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 - 1/2 = 2.5 points, the other player gets 0 points.
    - If both players choose A1: Each pays 1 point, so net gain is 3 - 1 = 2 points each.

3. **Analyzing the Implications of Signing the Contract:**
    - **Without Contract Analysis:**
        - Choosing A0 ensures a higher gain when facing another A0 (both get 5 points), but risks getting 0 points against A1.
        - Choosing A1 reduces the risk of a zero payoff but generally results in lower points since the best outcome with an A1 from both is 3 points each.

    - **With Contract Analysis:**
        - If both choose A0, nothing changes (5 points each).
        - If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1, that player gets penalized, reducing their gain for this action to 2.5.
        - If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0, you get penalized too, reducing your gain for this action to 2.5.
        - If both choose A1, you each face a penalty, netting only 2 points each.

4. **Strategic Considerations:**
    - Without the contract, both players have some incentive to play A1 to avoid the risk of a zero payoff scenario.
    - With the contract, the penalty makes the choice of A1 less appealing. In comparison to A0, the expected points with both players potentially agreeing to cooperate (choosing A0) results in a higher mutual payoff (5 points) compared to a penalized A1 (2 points).

5. **Decision:**
    - Signing the contract increases the likelihood of both players choosing A0, which benefits both with a higher mutual payoff.
    - Not signing the contract may lead to safe play (choosing A1) and lower overall payoffs.

From this breakdown, it's evident that signing the contract aligns both players toward maximizing their total score by cooperating and choosing A0. Therefore, it is beneficial to sign the contract.

response:
The game presents a coordination problem with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding 5 points each, and (A1, A1) yielding 3 points each. In the basic game, playing A1 is the "maximin" strategy for both players, meaning it guarantees a minimum payoff of 3 points regardless of what the other player chooses. In contrast, playing A0 carries the risk of receiving 0 points if the other player chooses A1. Because of this risk, players may default to (A1, A1) despite it being Pareto-inferior to (A0, A0).

The proposed contract introduces a 2-point penalty for playing A1, which is paid to the other player. This alters the payoff matrix as follows:
- (A0, A0): Remains (5, 5).
- (A0, A1): P2 (A1) pays 2 points to P1 (A0). Original (0, 3) becomes (2, 1).
- (A1, A0): P1 (A1) pays 2 points to P2 (A0). Original (3, 0) becomes (1, 2).
- (A1, A1): Both pay each other 2 points. Original (3, 3) remains (3, 3).

Under the contract, A0 becomes the "maximin" strategy. If you choose A0, your minimum payoff is 2 points (if the other player chooses A1), whereas if you choose A1, your minimum payoff is only 1 point (if the other player chooses A0). By making A0 both the higher-payoff and the safer choice, the contract strongly incentivizes both players to coordinate on the optimal (5, 5) outcome. Since the contract was proposed by Player 1, they are likely willing to sign it as well. Signing it is in your best interest to maximize your total points.

response:
To make a well-informed decision, we need to analyze the game both with and without the contract and determine the impact of the contract on payoffs.

### Without the Contract:

Let's first consider the payoffs without the contract:

- If both players choose A0, both players get 5 points each.
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 0 points, and Player 2 gets 3 points.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 3 points, and Player 2 gets 0 points.
- If both players choose A1, both players get 3 points each.

### With the Contract:

Now, let's evaluate the game if both players sign the contract. According to the contract, choosing A1 incurs a payment of 2 points, distributed equally between the two players. Thus, the net payoffs will be adjusted as follows:

- If both players choose A0, both players get 5 points each (no change).
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 1 point (0 + 1), and Player 2 gets 1 point (3 - 2).
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 1 point (3 - 2), and Player 2 gets 1 point (0 + 1).
- If both players choose A1, both players get 1 point each (3 - 2).

### Analysis:

#### Without the Contract:
- The best mutual outcome is when both choose A0, resulting in 5 + 5 = 10 points split evenly.
- If only one chooses A1, the one who chooses A1 gains a little advantage (3 vs. 0).

#### With the Contract:
- The best mutual outcome remains when both choose A0, resulting in 5 + 5 = 10 points.
- In all other scenarios, each player ends up with 1 point instead of 3 or 0, due to the payment penalty.

The contract effectively penalizes choosing A1, encouraging both players to consistently choose A0, which guarantees a higher joint payoff. 

Since signing the contract discourages deviation from the mutually optimal choice of choosing A0, the contract aligns both players’ incentives better towards the most beneficial outcome.

### Conclusion:
It is in the best interest to sign the contract as it encourages cooperation and ensures both players consistently receive the highest possible payoff of 5 points each.

### Final Answer:

  "sign": true

To make the correct decision, I need to analyze the game with both the basic rules and the contract rules in mind.

### Basic Game Rules:
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A0, I get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, I get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, I get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A1, both of us get 3 points.

### Contract Rules:
- If a player chooses A0, there's no additional payments.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points distributed equally among the other players.

Since the contract stipulates that every player who chooses A1 has to pay a penalty of 2 points and there are only 2 players in the game, the payment is crucial:
- Choosing A0 has no additional costs.
- Choosing A1 means a reduction of 2 points from the original payoff divided equally, so I will effectively lose 1 point.

Considering both sets of rules, the adjusted payoff matrix for me (Player 1) then becomes:
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A0, I get 5 points.
- If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, I get 0 points.
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, I get 2 points (3 points - 1 point payment).
- If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A1, I get 2 points (3 points - 1 point payment).

Now, let's construct the payoff table from my perspective:
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points
- (A1, A0): 2 points
- (A1, A1): 2 points

### Strategy Analysis:
To maximize my points:
1. If both players consistently choose A0, both receive 5 points.
2. Choosing A1 results in a lower payoff (effectively 2 points) regardless of what the other player chooses.

Since choosing A0 always results in the highest payoff relative to choosing A1 (since 2 < 5), the optimal probability distribution over actions should heavily favor A0. Even if considering altruism towards the other player, choosing A0 benefits both.

Therefore, I should choose A0 with a high probability to maximize my total points.

Here's the final answer in the required JSON format:

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

The payoff matrix for me (Player 1) is:
```
           Other's A0    Other's A1
My A0          5             0
My A1          3             3
```

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5 points and (A1, A1) giving 3 points. There's coordination risk.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (my proposal)

With A1 costing 3 points in penalties:

```
           Other's A0    Other's A1
My A0          5          0+3=3
My A1        3-3=0        3-3+3=3
```

After penalties:
- (A0, A0): 5 points for me
- (A0, A1): 3 points for me (they pay penalty)
- (A1, A0): 0 points for me (I pay penalty)
- (A1, A1): 3 points for me (penalties cancel)

Now A0 strictly dominates A1! No matter what the other player does, I'm better off (or equal) choosing A0. The same is true for them. This guarantees convergence to (A0, A0) with 5 points for me.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (Player 2's proposal)

With A0 receiving 1 and A1 paying 1:

When I play A0, I receive 1; when I play A1, I pay 1.
When they play A0, I pay 1; when they play A1, I receive 1.

Net payments:
- (A0, A0): +1-1 = 0, so I get 5
- (A0, A1): +1+1 = +2, so I get 2
- (A1, A0): -1-1 = -2, so I get 1
- (A1, A1): -1+1 = 0, so I get 3

```
           Other's A0    Other's A1
My A0          5             2
My A1          1             3
```

This still has two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1), but doesn't eliminate coordination risk.

## Step 4: Strategic comparison

- **Contract 1**: Guarantees optimal outcome (5 points) by making A0 dominant
- **Contract 2**: Still has coordination problem; could end up at (A1, A1) for only 3 points or mixed strategy equilibrium for even less
- **No contract**: Same coordination problems as Contract 2

## Step 5: Voting strategy

Contract 1 is unambiguously better for me than Contract 2. 

If I approve only C1:
- Best scenario: C1 wins (gets most approvals)
- Worst scenario: Tie with C2, but 50% chance of C1 is better than guaranteeing C2

If I approve both:
- Risk: If both get equal approvals, 50-50 lottery between C1 (which I strongly prefer) and C2

**Conclusion**: I should approve only C1.

{"C1": true, "C2": false}

response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the game in two scenarios: without the contract and with the contract.

### Scenario 1: Without the Contract

#### Payoff Matrix
- If both players choose A0: You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If both players choose A1: You get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

To maximize my points, I need to consider the other player's incentives and how they might play. Without the contract, the best equilibrium would be for both players to choose A0, giving 5 points each.

### Scenario 2: With the Contract

#### Adjusted Payoff Matrix (with contract)
When the contract is active, choosing A1 incurs an additional cost of 3 points, divided equally between the two players. Thus, choosing A1 means an additional deduction of 3 points from the player choosing A1. The updated payoffs would be:
- If both players choose A0: You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 1.5 points (0 + 1.5), the other player effectively loses 1.5 points (3 - 4.5).
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You effectively lose 1.5 points (3 - 4.5), the other player gets 1.5 points (0 + 1.5).
- If both players choose A1: You get 0 points (3 - 3), the other get 0 points (3 - 3).

Let's first break down how the contract changes the game's dynamics:
- A1 becomes less attractive because of the additional 3 point cost.
- If both players choose A1, they end up with 0 points each, which is worse than the 3 points they would get without the contract.

The contract incentivizes both players to avoid A1 and prefer A0.
Given these considerations, the contract should typically lead to stable equilibrium where:
- Both players choose A0 for a payoff of 5 points each.

### Final Decision
Based on the adjusted payoffs, the contract ensures you would more likely end up with 5 points (both choosing A0) than with the payoffs without the contract. Since the risk of the other player choosing A1 drops due to the penalty of the contract, it is even more beneficial to sign the contract.

Therefore, my decision would be to sign the contract.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the base game

First, let me find the Nash equilibrium of the original game without contracts.

For me (Player 1), if the other player plays A0 with probability p:
- Expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- Expected payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

I'm indifferent when 5p = 3, so p = 0.6.

By symmetry, the Nash equilibrium has both players playing A0 with probability 0.6.

**Base game Nash equilibrium payoff: 3.0** for each player.

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With a 3-point penalty for playing A1:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 3 = 3 (I receive other's penalty)
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 3 = 0 (I pay penalty)
- (A1, A1): I get 3 - 3 + 3 = 3 (I pay 3 but receive 3)

Comparing actions:
- Against A0: A0 gives 5, A1 gives 0 → A0 is better
- Against A1: A0 gives 3, A1 gives 3 → Tied

**A0 weakly dominates A1 under C1.** The unique Nash equilibrium is both playing A0.

**C1 Nash equilibrium payoff: 5.0** ✓ Better than base game!

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

With a 1-point penalty for playing A1:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 1 = 1
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 1 = 2
- (A1, A1): I get 3 - 1 + 1 = 3

If other plays A0 with probability p:
- My payoff from A0: 5p + 1(1-p) = 4p + 1
- My payoff from A1: 2p + 3(1-p) = 3 - p

Indifference when 4p + 1 = 3 - p, so p = 0.4.

**C2 Nash equilibrium payoff: 2.6** ✗ Worse than base game!

## Step 4: Strategic approval decision

Comparing outcomes:
- C1: 5.0 points (best)
- Base game: 3.0 points
- C2: 2.6 points (worst)

If I approve only C1:
- If opponent approves C1: C1 wins (payoff 5.0)
- If opponent approves C2: Tie between C1 and C2 (expected 3.8)
- If opponent approves both: C1 wins with 2 votes (payoff 5.0)
- If opponent approves neither: C1 wins (payoff 5.0)

If I approve both C1 and C2:
- This only hurts me when opponent approves both (random selection gives expected 3.8 instead of guaranteed 5.0)

By symmetry, the opponent has the same preferences and should also approve only C1.

**Conclusion:** Approve C1 only to maximize expected payoff.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 3 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Output Requirement:
- Respond with a valid JSON object.
- Format: {"sign": <BOOL>} where <BOOL> is true or false.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (my perspective as Player 1)
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITHOUT contract

This is a coordination game with no dominant strategy. To find the Nash equilibrium, I need to find when both players are best responding.

If the other player plays A0 with probability q:
- My payoff from A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q
- My payoff from A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

I'm indifferent when 5q = 3, so q = 3/5.

By symmetry, the Nash equilibrium is both players playing A0 with probability 3/5.

**Expected payoff at Nash equilibrium WITHOUT contract: 3 points**

## Step 3: Apply the contract terms

The contract states: If a player chooses A1, they pay 3 points to the other player.

Modified payoffs WITH contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 (no change)
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 3 = **3** (I receive other's penalty)
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 3 = **0** (I pay penalty)
- (A1, A1): I get 3 - 3 + 3 = **3** (I pay 3, receive 3)

## Step 4: Analyze the game WITH contract

My payoff matrix with contract:
```
              Other: A0    Other: A1
My A0:           5            3
My A1:           0            3
```

**Key insight: A0 now weakly dominates A1**
- When other plays A0: A0 gives 5 > A1 gives 0
- When other plays A1: A0 gives 3 = A1 gives 3

By symmetry, the other player has the same dominant strategy.

**The unique Nash equilibrium WITH contract: Both play A0, getting 5 points each**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- WITHOUT contract: Expected payoff = 3 points
- WITH contract: Expected payoff = 5 points

The contract transforms the game to make mutual cooperation (A0, A0) the dominant strategy equilibrium, increasing both players' payoffs from 3 to 5.

## Conclusion

The contract benefits both players equally and creates aligned incentives. I should sign.

Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the original game payoffs

Without the contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 5, opponent gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, opponent gets 3

## Step 2: Analyze the original game

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: gives (5, 5) - the best outcome
- **(A1, A1)**: gives (3, 3) - a safer but worse outcome

The problem is that A0 is risky: if I play A0 but opponent plays A1, I get 0. This creates a coordination problem where players might play A1 defensively, settling for the suboptimal (3, 3) outcome.

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs with the contract

The contract adds:
- Playing A0: +2 to me, -2 to opponent
- Playing A1: -2 to me, +2 to opponent

New payoff matrix WITH contract:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 2 - 2 = **5** for me, 5 for opponent
- (A0, A1): 0 + 2 + 2 = **4** for me, -1 for opponent  
- (A1, A0): 3 - 2 - 2 = **-1** for me, 4 for opponent
- (A1, A1): 3 - 2 + 2 = **3** for me, 3 for opponent

## Step 4: Analyze strategic implications

With the contract:
- If opponent plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 > -1) ✓
- If opponent plays A1: I prefer A0 (4 > 3) ✓

**A0 becomes a dominant strategy for both players!**

## Step 5: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract**: Coordination problem, risk of getting 0-3 points, uncertainty
- **With contract**: A0 is dominant strategy → guaranteed outcome of (5, 5)

## Conclusion

The contract eliminates the coordination problem and guarantees the best possible outcome. It makes the risky cooperative choice (A0) safe and dominant. Since the opponent proposed this contract, they likely recognize this benefit too.

**Final Answer:**

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Analyze the Base Game (No Contract)

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):
```
                Player 2
                A0    A1
Player 1  A0   (5,5) (0,3)
          A1   (3,0) (3,3)
```

Finding the Nash equilibrium without contracts:
- If Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, I'm indifferent between actions when: 5p = 3p + 3(1-p) = 3
- This gives p = 0.6
- By symmetry, the mixed Nash equilibrium is (0.6, 0.6)
- Expected payoff: 0.36×5 + 0.24×0 + 0.24×3 + 0.16×3 = **3.0 points each**

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (Penalty of 3 points for A1)

Modified payoff matrix:
```
                Player 2
                A0    A1
Player 1  A0   (5,5) (0,0)  [I pay 3 to P1, net: 3-3=0]
          A1   (0,3) (3,3)  [P1 pays 3 to me, net: 0+3=3]
```

Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0): (5, 5)** - Pareto optimal!
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

The large penalty eliminates mixed strategy equilibria and creates a stark choice between cooperation and defection.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (Penalty of 1 point for A1)

Modified payoff matrix:
```
                Player 2
                A0    A1
Player 1  A0   (5,5) (1,2)  [I pay 1 to P1]
          A1   (2,1) (3,3)  [P1 pays 1 to me]
```

Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0): (5, 5)** - Pareto optimal!
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)
- Mixed strategy at (0.4, 0.4): 2.6 points each

## Step 4: Comparison and Decision

**Both contracts create the same pure Nash equilibria**, with (A0, A0) giving 5 points each - a significant improvement over the base game's 3 points.

Key observations:
1. Both contracts make mutual cooperation (A0, A0) a Nash equilibrium
2. This outcome Pareto dominates all other equilibria
3. The (A0, A0) equilibrium is highly focal and should be the expected outcome with rational play
4. Both contracts are strictly better than no contract if we coordinate on the good equilibrium

Contract 1 has a stronger penalty structure that eliminates bad mixed equilibria entirely. Contract 2 is more forgiving of deviations but maintains the same desirable pure equilibria.

Since both contracts enable the Pareto optimal outcome of (5, 5) and both are improvements over no contract, I should approve both to maximize the probability that some beneficial contract is implemented.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix without contract

From my perspective as Player 2:
- (Me: A0, Other: A0) → I get 5
- (Me: A0, Other: A1) → I get 0  
- (Me: A1, Other: A0) → I get 3
- (Me: A1, Other: A1) → I get 3

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs with the contract

The contract penalizes A1 by 1 point (paid to the other player):
- (Me: A0, Other: A0) → I get 5 (no change)
- (Me: A0, Other: A1) → I get 0 + 1 = 1 (other pays me)
- (Me: A1, Other: A0) → I get 3 - 1 = 2 (I pay other)
- (Me: A1, Other: A1) → I get 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 (we pay each other, net zero)

## Step 3: Analyze Nash equilibria

**Without contract:**
- Pure equilibria: (A0, A0) giving (5,5) and (A1, A1) giving (3,3)
- Mixed strategy equilibrium: both play A0 with probability 3/5
  - Expected payoff: 3 points

**With contract:**
- Pure equilibria: (A0, A0) giving (5,5) and (A1, A1) giving (3,3) - same!
- Mixed strategy equilibrium: both play A0 with probability 2/5
  - Expected payoff: 2.6 points

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

The contract:
- ✓ Reduces my loss if caught playing A0 against A1 (1 vs 0)
- ✗ Makes mixed strategy equilibrium worse (2.6 vs 3)
- = Doesn't change the pure strategy equilibria

Since the mixed strategy equilibrium yields a lower expected payoff with the contract (2.6 vs 3), and the desirable pure equilibria remain unchanged, the contract reduces my expected value if there's any uncertainty in play.

**Conclusion:** The contract makes me worse off in expectation.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break down this decision step by step to determine whether it is beneficial to sign the contract:

### Step 1: Analyze Payoffs Without Contract

First, we need to establish the payoffs when there's no contract involved:
- If both players choose A0: Both get 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: Both get 3 points.

### Step 2: Analyze Payoffs With Contract

Now we need to incorporate the contract:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payment.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 2 points, distributed equally among the players (1 point each).

Let's update the payoffs while considering the payment:
- If both players choose A0: Both get 5 points. (No change)
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: 
  - You get 0 points (from A0) + 1 point (half of the 2 points the other player pays) = 1 point.
  - The other player gets 3 points (from A1) - 2 points = 1 point.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0:
  - You get 3 points (from A1) - 2 points + 1 point (you pay 2 points, half returned) = 2 points.
  - The other player gets 0 points (from A0) + 1 point = 1 point
- If both choose A1:
  - You get 3 points (from A1) - 2 points + 1 point = 2 points.
  - The other player gets 3 points (from A1) - 2 points + 1 point = 2 points.

### Step 3: Compare Outcomes

Without Contract:
- Both A0: 5 points each
- A0 (You) and A1 (Other): 0 and 3 points
- A1 (You) and A0 (Other): 3 and 0 points
- Both A1: 3 points each

With Contract:
- Both A0: 5 points each
- A0 (You) and A1 (Other): 1 and 1 points
- A1 (You) and A0 (Other): 2 and 1 points
- Both A1: 2 points each

### Step 4: Decision Analysis

- The outcomes for A0 are better without the contract (5 vs. 5 without contract compared to 5 and 5 with contract).
- However, the outcomes involving A1 are better balanced with the contract. Specifically:
  - A0 and A1: Better balance (1 and 1)
  - A1 and A0: Slightly better for choosing A1 (you get 2 instead of 3, but the opponent gets 1 instead of 0, making you slightly less worse off in a tit-for-tat situation)
  - Both A1: 2 points each is a more balanced outcome than 3 points each.

Given that the contract makes the game more balanced and mitigates risks where both players benefit more equitably rather than one player having a zero point, it might promote cooperation and less risky behavior.

### Final Decision

Taking all the above reasoning into account, it is advantageous for you to sign the contract.

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, let’s first evaluate the payoff matrix based on the rules provided.

### 1. Original Payoff Matrix (P1, P2)
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3) (Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2 chooses A1)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0) (Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2 chooses A0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### 2. Effects of the Payment Contract
The contract states:
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points to the other player.
- If a player chooses A0, no payments are made.

**Modified Payoffs:**
- **(A0, A0):** Neither player pays anything. Payoffs remain **(5, 5)**.
- **(A0, A1):** Player 2 chooses A1 and pays 2 points to Player 1.
  Player 1: 0 + 2 = 2
  Player 2: 3 - 2 = 1
  Result: **(2, 1)**
- **(A1, A0):** Player 1 chooses A1 and pays 2 points to Player 2.
  Player 1: 3 - 2 = 1
  Player 2: 0 + 2 = 2
  Result: **(1, 2)**
- **(A1, A1):** Both players choose A1. Both pay 2 points and receive 2 points.
  Player 1: 3 - 2 + 2 = 3
  Player 2: 3 - 2 + 2 = 3
  Result: **(3, 3)**

### 3. Modified Payoff Matrix Analysis
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (2, 1) |
| **P1: A1** | (1, 2) | (3, 3) |

**Equilibrium Analysis:**
- If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2's best response is A0 (5 points vs 1 point).
- If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2's best response is A1 (3 points vs 2 points).
- If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1's best response is A0 (5 points vs 1 point).
- If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1's best response is A1 (3 points vs 2 points).

There are two Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria: **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)**.

### 4. Decision
In coordination games with multiple equilibria, players typically aim for the **payoff-dominant equilibrium**, which is the one that offers the highest reward to all players. Here, (A0, A0) yields 5 points each, while (A1, A1) yields only 3 points each.

Furthermore, the payment contract has made A0 a significantly "safer" strategy than it was in the original game. In the modified game, you only need to be 20% certain that the other player will choose A0 for A0 to be your best choice (compared to 60% in the original game). Given that Player 1 proposed this contract, they are signaling a desire to coordinate on the most mutually beneficial outcome, which is (A0, A0).

Therefore, choosing A0 with 100% probability is the most logical decision to maximize points.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

To determine the optimal strategy in this decision-making game, let's analyze the payoff matrix which is given:

1. If both players choose A0: Player 1 gets 5 points, Player 2 gets 5 points.
2. If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
3. If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
4. If both players choose A1: Both players get 3 points each.

### Analysis Without Contract
Given that no contract modifications apply, we are dealing with the basic game with the above payoffs.

### Step 1: Consider Pure Strategies
First, let's evaluate the payoffs for the pure strategies, which means each player chooses one action with 100% probability.

- If Player 1 always chooses A0:
  - If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 5 points.
  - If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 0 points.
  
- If Player 1 always chooses A1:
  - If Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points.
  - If Player 2 chooses A1: Player 1 gets 3 points.

From Player 1's perspective:
- Choosing A0 guarantees a potential 5 points or 0 points.
- Choosing A1 guarantees a more predictable 3 points, regardless of Player 2's choice.

### Step 2: Mixed Strategy Equilibrium
Considering mixed strategy equilibrium involves each player randomizing over actions. To find an equilibrium, both players' strategies should make the other indifferent between their actions.

Let’s denote:
- \( p \) as the probability that Player 1 chooses A0.
- \( q \) as the probability that Player 2 chooses A0.

In equilibrium, Player 2's expectation from choosing A0 should equal the expectation from choosing A1, and vice versa for Player 1.

For Player 1:
- E(Player 1 | A0) = \( 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q \)
- E(Player 1 | A1) = \( 3(1-q) + 3q = 3 \)

Setting these equal for indifference:
\[ 5q = 3 \]
\[ q = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \]

For Player 2:
- E(Player 2 | A0) = \( 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p \)
- E(Player 2 | A1) = \( 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 \)

Setting these equal for indifference:
\[ 5p = 3 \]
\[ p = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \]

### Conclusion
Since the mixed strategy equilibrium for both players is the same:
- Both players should choose A0 with probability 60% and A1 with probability 40%.

Now, let's convert these probabilities to the required JSON format, ensuring integer values that sum to 100.

```json
{"A0": 60, "A1": 40}
```

This is the optimal strategy for Player 1, given the game’s structure and payoffs.

response:
To decide whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the game's payoffs and how the contract changes the strategic incentives.

### 1. Original Payoff Matrix
Based on the description, we can identify the points for Player 1 (Row) and Player 2 (Column, which is you):
*   **(A0, A0):** (5, 5)
*   **(A0, A1):** Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 3 (since "you" get 3 when you pick A1 and the "other" picks A0)
*   **(A1, A0):** Player 1 gets 3, Player 2 gets 0 (since "you" get 0 when you pick A0 and the "other" picks A1)
*   **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)

**Matrix (P1, P2):**
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

**Analysis of Original Game:**
*   **Nash Equilibria:** There are two equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding (5, 5) and (A1, A1) yielding (3, 3).
*   **Risk:** Picking A0 is risky. If the other player picks A1, you get 0. Picking A1 is "safe"; you get 3 points regardless of what the other player does. Because A1 is risk-dominant, players often default to the (3, 3) outcome even though (5, 5) is better.

### 2. The Contract
The contract states: If a player chooses A1, they pay 3 points to the other player.
*   **(A0, A0):** No payments. (5, 5)
*   **(A0, A1):** P2 chooses A1 and pays 3 to P1. P2's payoff: $3 - 3 = 0$. P1's payoff: $0 + 3 = 3$. Result: (3, 0).
*   **(A1, A0):** P1 chooses A1 and pays 3 to P2. P1's payoff: $3 - 3 = 0$. P2's payoff: $0 + 3 = 3$. Result: (0, 3).
*   **(A1, A1):** Both choose A1. Both pay 3 and receive 3. Payoffs: $3 - 3 + 3 = 3$. Result: (3, 3).

**Matrix with Contract (P1, P2):**
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (3, 0) |
| **P1: A1** | (0, 3) | (3, 3) |

### 3. Analysis of the Contract Game
*   **Dominant Strategy:** In the contract version, if the other player picks A1, you get 3 points picking A0 and 3 points picking A1. If the other player picks A0, you get 5 points picking A0 and 0 points picking A1. Thus, **A0 is a weakly dominant strategy**.
*   **Safety:** The contract makes A0 the "safe" bet. You are guaranteed at least 3 points if you pick A0 (assuming the other player is rational), but you can get up to 5 points.
*   **Coordination:** The contract essentially fixes the coordination problem by making (A0, A0) both the Pareto-optimal and the risk-dominant equilibrium.

### 4. Conclusion
The contract effectively eliminates the risk of trying to coordinate on the high-payoff (5, 5) equilibrium. It protects you from receiving 0 points and makes picking A0 the most rational choice for both players. Since Player 1 proposed this contract, they are highly likely to sign it as well.

First incorporate the contract into the payoffs.

**Contract effects (2 players):**
- If *I* choose **A0**: I get **+2** (the other pays −2).
- If *I* choose **A1**: I pay **−2** (the other gets +2).
- If the *other* chooses **A0**: they take **2 from me** (so I get **−2**).
- If the *other* chooses **A1**: they pay **2 to me** (so I get **+2**).

Now compute my (Player 2) total payoff for each action pair:

1) **(P1 A0, P2 A0)**  
Base: 5  
Contract: (my A0) +2, (their A0) −2 → net 0  
Total: **5**

2) **(P1 A0, P2 A1)**  
Base (A1 vs A0): 3  
Contract: (my A1) −2, (their A0) −2 → net −4  
Total: **3 − 4 = −1**

3) **(P1 A1, P2 A0)**  
Base (A0 vs A1): 0  
Contract: (my A0) +2, (their A1) +2 → net +4

4) **(P1 A1, P2 A1)**  
Base: 3  
Contract: (my A1) −2, (their A1) +2 → net 0

So against **P1 A0**, A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives −1.  
Against **P1 A1**, A0 gives 4 vs A1 gives 3.

**A0 strictly dominates A1**, so my optimal strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understand the original game without contract

**Payoff Matrix (My points, Other's points):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**My incentives without contract:**
- If other plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 0 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → prefer A1

This creates a coordination problem. The game has two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) with payoffs (5, 5) and (A1, A1) with payoffs (3, 3), plus a mixed strategy equilibrium where both players play A0 with 60% probability and get expected payoff of 3.

### Step 2: Analyze the game with the contract

**Contract terms:** If a player chooses A1, they pay 3 points to the other player.

**Modified Payoff Matrix with contract:**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) - no change
- (A0, A1): (0+3, 3-3) = (3, 0) - I receive their penalty
- (A1, A0): (3-3, 0+3) = (0, 3) - I pay penalty to them
- (A1, A1): (3-3+3, 3-3+3) = (3, 3) - we exchange penalties

**My incentives with contract:**
- If other plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs 0 from A1 → strongly prefer A0
- If other plays A1: I get 3 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → indifferent

### Step 3: Identify the strategic impact

With the contract, **A0 weakly dominates A1** for both players. This means:
- A0 is at least as good as A1 in all scenarios
- A0 is strictly better than A1 when the opponent plays A0

This makes (A0, A0) the **unique Nash equilibrium** with the contract, guaranteeing payoffs of (5, 5).

### Step 4: Compare outcomes

- **Without contract:** Risk of coordination failure leading to (A1, A1) or mixed equilibrium with expected payoff of 3
- **With contract:** Unique equilibrium at (A0, A0) with guaranteed payoff of 5

### Conclusion

The contract eliminates coordination risk and ensures the optimal outcome (A0, A0) with payoff 5, compared to the 3 I would expect without it. This is a strict improvement.

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 3 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's break down the game and payment contract step-by-step to determine the optimal strategy:

### Payoff Matrix Without Contract
First, let's outline the payoffs for both players:

|         | Player 2 A0 | Player 2 A1 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Player 1 A0 | (5, 5)      | (0, 3)      |
| Player 1 A1 | (3, 0)      | (3, 3)      |

- If both choose A0: both get 5 points.
- If you (Player 2) choose A0 and the other player (Player 1) chooses A1: you get 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and Player 1 chooses A0: you get 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: both get 3 points each.

### Additional Payment Contract
Now consider the contract penalty: If a player chooses A1, they incur an additional penalty of 3 points distributed equally among other players.

### Adjusted Payoff Matrix with Contract (Player 2 is you)
Given the contract penalty:
- If you choose A1, you pay 3 points, so your net gain is reduced.
- If Player 1 chooses A1, they also pay 3 points, which affects their net gain.

|         | Player 2 A0             | Player 2 A1      |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Player 1 A0 | (5, 5)                | (0, 3-3=0)       |
| Player 1 A1 | (3-3=0, 0+1.5=1.5)   | (3-3=0, 3-3+1.5=1.5) |

- If both choose A0: both get 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and Player 1 chooses A1: you get 1.5 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- If you choose A1, regardless of Player 1's choice: your net gain is reduced by 1.5 points due to the penalty.

### Strategy Analysis
Given the consequence of payments on net payoffs, we see:
- Choosing A1 results in suboptimal points due to the penalty, reducing the incentive to choose A1.

### Optimal Strategy
You should prefer to maximize payoffs, ruling out choices that incur penalties. Here, choosing A0 completely avoids the additional payment cost and maximizes the baseline points:

**Probability Distribution Recommendation:**
- Strongly favor A0, given that A1 imposes a penalty.

Based on this, assuming Player 1 also acts rationally to avoid the penalty, we derive the following recommended strategy:

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

In conclusion, always choosing A0 is the strategy that maximizes your total points in this adjusted game context.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoffs with the contract

Let me work out what each player receives after accounting for both the base game and the contract:

**Original payoffs + Contract effects:**

1. **Both choose A0:**
   - Base: I get 5
   - Contract: I receive +2 (for choosing A0) and pay -2 (because they chose A0)
   - **My total: 5**

2. **I choose A0, they choose A1:**
   - Base: I get 0
   - Contract: I receive +2 (for choosing A0) and receive +2 (because they pay for choosing A1)
   - **My total: 4**

3. **I choose A1, they choose A0:**
   - Base: I get 3
   - Contract: I pay -2 (for choosing A1) and pay -2 (to them for their A0)
   - **My total: -1**

4. **Both choose A1:**
   - Base: I get 3
   - Contract: I pay -2 (for choosing A1) and receive +2 (because they pay for choosing A1)
   - **My total: 3**

## Step 2: Create my payoff matrix

```
              Other plays A0    Other plays A1
I play A0          5                 4
I play A1         -1                 3
```

## Step 3: Find the optimal strategy

Let me check if I have a dominant strategy:

- **If they play A0:** A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -1 → **A0 is better**
- **If they play A1:** A0 gives me 4, A1 gives me 3 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - it gives me a higher payoff regardless of what the other player does.

## Step 4: Verify with expected values

Even if the other player uses a mixed strategy with probability p for A0:
- Expected payoff from A0: 5p + 4(1-p) = p + 4
- Expected payoff from A1: -1p + 3(1-p) = 3 - 4p

A0 is better when: p + 4 > 3 - 4p → 5p > -1 → p > -0.2

Since any valid probability p ≥ 0, **A0 is always optimal**.

## Conclusion

The contract transforms the game to make A0 a dominant strategy. I should play A0 with 100% probability to maximize my expected points.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

response:
To maximize the total points received as Player 2, let's analyze the game after incorporating the payment contract.

### 1. Identify the Original Payoffs
The original payoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) are as follows:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3) — *Note: P2 chooses A1, P1 chooses A0*
- (A1, A0): (3, 0) — *Note: P2 chooses A0, P1 chooses A1*
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### 2. Apply the Contract
The contract states that any player choosing A1 must pay 3 points to the other player. Let's recalculate the payoffs:
- **(A0, A0)**: Neither player pays anything.
  - Payoff: **(5, 5)**
- **(A0, A1)**: Player 2 pays 3 points to Player 1.
  - Payoff: (0 + 3, 3 - 3) = **(3, 0)**
- **(A1, A0)**: Player 1 pays 3 points to Player 2.
  - Payoff: (3 - 3, 0 + 3) = **(0, 3)**
- **(A1, A1)**: Both players pay 3 points to each other (net 0 change).
  - Payoff: (3 - 3 + 3, 3 - 3 + 3) = **(3, 3)**

### 3. Analyze the Adjusted Payoff Matrix
The updated payoffs (P1, P2) are:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (3, 0)
- (A1, A0): (0, 3)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### 4. Determine the Optimal Strategy for Player 2
- If Player 1 chooses **A0**:
  - Player 2 choosing A0 gives **5** points.
  - Player 2 choosing A1 gives **0** points.
- If Player 1 chooses **A1**:
  - Player 2 choosing A0 gives **3** points.
  - Player 2 choosing A1 gives **3** points.

In all scenarios, choosing **A0** is as good as or strictly better than choosing A1. A0 is a weakly dominant strategy for Player 2. Since the game is symmetrical, Player 1 faces the same logic (A0 is also a weakly dominant strategy for them).

### 5. Nash Equilibrium
The pair (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium where both players receive 5 points. While (A1, A1) is also a weak Nash equilibrium (yielding 3 points each), there is no incentive to choose A1 over A0, especially since (A0, A0) provides a significantly higher payoff (5 vs 3). Player 1, having proposed the contract, likely intends to play A0 to maximize their own points.

Final strategy: Choose A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Looking at this decision step by step:

## Step 1: Analyze the game WITHOUT the contract

The payoff matrix shows:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

This game has:
- Two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5 points each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 points each
- A coordination problem: which equilibrium will we reach?
- A mixed strategy equilibrium where both players play A0 with probability 3/5, yielding expected payoff of 3

## Step 2: Analyze the game WITH the contract

The contract adds: "If a player chooses A1, they pay 3 points to the other player"

New effective payoffs:
- (A0, A0): I get 5 (unchanged)
- (A0, A1): I get 0 + 3 (receive payment) = 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3 - 3 (make payment) = 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3 + 3 - 3 = 3

## Step 3: Compare strategic implications

With the contract:
- If opponent plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me 0 → **A0 is better**
- If opponent plays A1: A0 gives me 3, A1 gives me 3 → **Indifferent**

This means **A0 weakly dominates A1** under the contract. Rational players will choose A0, leading to the unique equilibrium (A0, A0) with payoff 5.

## Step 4: Decision

Without contract: Risk of coordination failure leading to payoffs of 3
With contract: Guaranteed coordination on (A0, A0) with payoff 5

The contract eliminates the coordination problem and ensures we reach the best outcome. It provides a mechanism to make A0 the clearly rational choice by penalizing deviations to A1.

**Signing the contract maximizes my expected payoff.**

Let's analyze this decision step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)**

This is a simultaneous-move game with two players. Each chooses between A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

Remember: You are **Player 2** in this game.

So, from your perspective (Player 2), the payoffs are:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | 5      | 0      |
| **You: A1**   | 3      | 3      |

Now, let’s find the Nash equilibria in the base game.

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - Your best response: A0 (5 > 3)
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - Your best response: A1 (3 = 3 → indifferent, but A1 is not worse)

So:
- If you play A0, you get 5 if P1 plays A0, 0 if P1 plays A1.
- If you play A1, you get 3 regardless of P1.

So your optimal strategy depends on what you think P1 will do.

Let’s find mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability *p*, A1 with *1−p*.

Your expected payoff from:
- A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3

Set equal for indifference:
5p = 3 → p = 3/5

So if Player 1 plays A0 with probability 3/5, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Similarly, in symmetric logic, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1 when you play A0 with probability 3/5.

Thus, one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is: both players play A0 with 3/5 probability, A1 with 2/5.

But note: There are also pure strategy Nash equilibria.

Check pure strategies:
- (A0, A0): (5,5). If you deviate to A1: get 3 < 5 → no incentive. If P1 deviates: get 0 < 5 → no incentive. So (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): (3,3). If you deviate to A0: get 0 < 3 → no incentive. If P1 deviates to A0: get 0 < 3 → no incentive. So (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

So the base game has **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), and a mixed equilibrium.

Your goal is to **maximize your expected payoff**.

But now comes the **contract**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

The contract says:

- If a player chooses A0: no additional payment.
- If a player chooses A1: they **pay an additional 2 points**, distributed equally among the **other players**.

Important: You are **Player 2**, and the contract is presented by Player 1.

The contract only becomes active if **all players sign it**. You are deciding whether to sign.

So if you **sign**, and Player 1 signs, the contract takes effect.

If you don’t sign, the contract doesn’t take effect — you play the base game.

So you must decide: **Is it better to sign the contract (and play under modified payoffs), or not sign (and play base game)?**

---

### **Step 3: Analyze how the contract changes payoffs**

When the contract is **active**, a player who chooses A1 pays 2 points to the **other player(s)** — distributed equally.

There are **only two players**, so if you choose A1, you pay 2 points, and the **other player** receives 2 points (because it's distributed equally among the other players — only one other).

So the **net effect** on payoffs:

- If you (P2) choose A1: you lose 2 points **from your own score**, and P1 gains 2 points (from the payment).
- If P1 chooses A1: P1 loses 2, you gain 2.

So remap the payoffs with the contract in effect:

#### New payoff matrix (with contract active):

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | (5, 5) | (0 − 2, 3 + 2) = (−2, 5) |
| **You: A1**   | (3 + 2, 0 − 2) = (5, −2) | (3 − 2, 3 − 2) = (1, 1) |

Wait: Let's be precise.

- When you choose A1, you **pay 2 points**, so your payoff decreases by 2.
- The other player gets +2.
- Similarly, when P1 chooses A1, P1 loses 2, you gain 2.

So:

- (A0, A0): no A1 played → no payments → (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): you play A0 (no cost), P1 plays A1 → P1 loses 2, you gain 2 → your payoff: 0 + 2 = 2, P1: 3 − 2 = 1 → but wait!

Wait! The **contract says**: "if a player chooses A1, they pay 2 points, distributed equally among the other players."

So if **P1** chooses A1, he pays 2 points to **you** (the other player), so:
- You gain 2
- P1 loses 2

Similarly, if you choose A1, you pay 2 to P1 → you lose 2, P1 gains 2.

Now apply to each cell:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | (5, 5) | (0 + 2, 3 − 2) = (2, 1) |
| **You: A1**   | (3 − 2, 0 + 2) = (1, 2) | (3 − 2, 3 − 2) = (1, 1) |

So new matrix:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | (5, 5) | (2, 1) |
| **You: A1**   | (1, 2) | (1, 1) |

Now, we want to determine the **best expected payoff** you can get under this changed game, assuming **both players can choose strategies** and are rational, and the contract is in effect.

You must compare:
- Expected payoff **if you sign the contract** and both play optimally under the new payoffs.
- Expected payoff **if you do not sign** the contract → so you play the base game.

But note: If you **do not sign**, then **the contract is not active**, so no payment, and game is base game.

So you need to compute:
- E[Y | sign and contract active]: your expected payoff in the game with contract, under optimal play (Nash equilibrium).
- E[Y | don't sign]: your expected payoff in base game.

Then choose to sign if E[Y | sign] > E[Y | don't sign].

But — there's a catch: **if you don’t sign, you cannot enforce the contract**. So only if both sign does it apply.

So the decision is: **is it worth it to sign** the contract, knowing that if you sign, you’re locked into the modified game; if not, you play base game.

And assuming Player 1 has also decided to sign (or not), but the only way the contract is active is if **both** sign.

But the contract was proposed by Player 1 and approved via voting — so it's **already passed**, but **only if all players agree**.

So the system is: **both** must agree.

Therefore, to get the contract active, **you must sign** and **Player 1 must sign**.

But we are not told whether Player 1 will sign.

But we can assume **Player 1 is rational and self-interested**.

But we need to think about **credible commitment** and **possible outcomes**.

But perhaps we can model: if you sign, and Player 1 also signs (which he likely will, if he gains), then the contract applies.

But if you don’t sign, the contract doesn’t apply.

So we must evaluate: **under the contract, can you expect a higher expected payoff than in base game?**

Let’s analyze both games.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze expected payoff in base game (no contract)**

From earlier, base game has **two pure Nash equilibria**:
- (A0, A0) → you get 5
- (A1, A1) → you get 3

And a mixed equilibrium.

But which one will players play?

We don’t know. But rational players can coordinate on (A0,A0), which is a **Pareto-efficient** outcome (5,5) vs (3,3). So likely, both players will play (A0,A0) if they can coordinate.

But (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium, but worse for both.

So if players are rational and can coordinate, they would play (A0,A0).

But the question is — is (A0,A0) the stable outcome?

Yes, because:
- If you play A0, you get 5 if P1 plays A0.
- If P1 thinks you will play A0, P1 should play A0 (5 > 0).
- So rational players can coordinate on (A0,A0).

So in base game, **likely outcome is (A0, A0)** → you get **5**.

Alternatively, if players are unpredictable, mixed equilibrium: both play A0 with 3/5.

Then your expected payoff:  
P(A0) = 3/5 → you get 5 with p=3/5 when P1 plays A0, etc.

But since (A0,A0) is a pure NE and better, and there is no incentive to deviate, **coordination on (A0,A0)** is reasonable.

So **in base game**, assume you both play A0 → you get **5**.

But let’s confirm: could you get a higher payoff?

No. If you play A1, and P1 plays A0, you get 3 < 5.

So maximum you can get in base game is 5.

So **if no contract**, you can get **5**.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze game with contract active**

Now, with contract, the payoff matrix is:

|               | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **You: A0**   | (5, 5) | (2, 1) |
| **You: A1**   | (1, 2) | (1, 1) |

Let’s find Nash equilibria.

Check pure strategies:

- (A0, A0): (5,5)
  - If you deviate to A1: get 1 < 5 → no
  - If P1 deviates to A1: get 1 < 5 → no
  → So (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

- (A0, A1): (2,1)
  - You: 2 → if you deviate to A1: get 1 < 2 → no
  - P1: 1 → if P1 deviates to A0: get 5 > 1 → yes, so P1 wants to deviate
  → Not Nash

- (A1, A0): (1,2)
  - You: 1 → if you deviate to A0: get 5 > 1 → yes, so you want to deviate
  → Not Nash

- (A1, A1): (1,1)
  - You: 1 → if you deviate to A0: get 2 > 1 → yes
  - P1: 1 → if he deviates to A0: get 5 > 1 → yes
  → Not Nash

So **only pure Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0)**.

Now check mixed strategies.

Let P1 play A0 with probability *p*, A1 with *1−p*.

Your expected payoff:
- A0: 5p + 2(1−p) = 5p + 2 − 2p = 3p + 2
- A1: 1p + 1(1−p) = p + 1 − p = 1

Set equal: 3p + 2 = 1 → 3p = −1 → p = −1/3 → impossible.

So no mixing makes you indifferent.

Since 3p + 2 > 1 for all p ≥ 0 (minimum at p=0: 2 > 1), so **you always prefer A0**.

So your best response is always A0, regardless of P1's strategy.

Similarly, compute P1's best response.

Let you play A0 with probability *q*, A1 with 1−q.

P1’s payoffs:
- A0: 5q + 1(1−q) = 5q + 1 − q = 4q + 1
- A1: 1q + 1(1−q) = 1

Set equal: 4q + 1 = 1 → q = 0.

So when q > 0, 4q + 1 > 1 → P1 prefers A0.

Only when q=0, indifferent.

But since you never play A1 (because A0 strictly dominates), q=0.

So P1’s best response is A0.

Thus, **in the contract game, A0 is dominant strategy for you**.

Similarly, P1’s best response to your A0 is A0.

So the only equilibrium is: both play A0.

So outcome is (A0,A0), you get **5**.

Wait — but this is the **same as before**.

In base game: (A0,A0) → you get 5.

In contract game: (A0,A0) → you get 5.

So same payoff?

But let’s double-check.

In contract game, (A0,A0): no one played A1 → no payments → same as base game → (5,5)

So yes, same outcome.

But what if P1 deviates?

No: as shown, (A0,A0) is the only Nash equilibrium, and both players strictly prefer A0.

So expected payoff: **5**

Same as base game.

So **no gain** from the contract?

But is that the whole story?

Wait — what if **P1 doesn't want the contract**, but you do?

But the contract only applies if **both sign**.

So if you sign, but P1 doesn't, the contract doesn’t apply — you play base game.

But if **both sign**, you get contract game → (5,5) → you get 5.

If **neither signs**, base game → (5,5) → you get 5.

If **you sign, P1 doesn’t**, no contract → base game → you get 5.

So **in all cases**, you get 5?

But wait — suppose P1 is not rational, or you change your behavior.

But in the contract game, you are still best off playing A0, and P1 is best off playing A0.

But here’s a **crucial point**: the contract **penalizes A1**, so it reduces incentives to play A1.

In the base game, (A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium, but it gives only 3.

In the contract game, (A1,A1) gives (1,1), which is worse than (5,5).

So the contract removes (A1,A1) as equilibrium.

But (A0,A0) still exists.

And it's better.

So the contract **doesn’t hurt you**, but also doesn’t help you — **you still get 5**.

But wait — in the base game, is (A0,A0) stable?

Yes.

But what if the players **don’t coordinate**, and end up playing (A1,A1)?

Then you get 3.

But (A1,A1) is only a Nash equilibrium if players are not coordinated.

But since (A0,A0) is strictly better and also a Nash equilibrium, rational players should coordinate on (A0,A0).

So in equilibrium, you get 5.

But suppose you are **uncertain** about P1’s choice.

But still, with the contract, you get **at least** 5? No.

Wait — in the contract game, if P1 plays A1, and you play A0, you get 2.

That’s less than 5.

But since P1 has **no incentive** to play A1 if you play A0 (because P1 gets 5 if he plays A0, only 1 if he plays A1), so he won’t.

So in all equilibria, both play A0.

So outcome: (5,5)

So **no difference** in expected payoff between base game and contract game.

But wait — what if P1 plays a mixed strategy?

No: as shown, A0 is dominant strategy for you, and A0 is best response for P1 to any strategy (since 4q + 1 ≥ 1, and >1 if q>0).

So only equilibrium is (A0,A0).

So **you get 5** in both cases.

So signing or not yields same expected payoff.

But is that really true?

Wait — here’s the **key insight**:

In the **base game**, (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium, but so is (A1,A1), and **(A1,A1) could be played** if players coordinate poorly or irrationally.

But (A1,A1) gives only 3 to you.

The contract **removes (A1,A1)** as equilibrium, because if you play A0, P1 gets 5 vs 1 for A1.

And if you play A1, you get 1 vs 2 for A0.

So **in contract game, (A1,A1) is not an equilibrium**.

So the contract **eliminates the low-payoff equilibrium**.

Whereas in base game, if players are not coordinated, they might end up in (A1,A1).

But is coordination on (A0,A0) more likely?

Yes — because it’s better.

But suppose you are risk-averse or fear miscoordination.

Then the contract **improves your expected payoff** by **eliminating the bad equilibrium**, even if you end up getting the same 5 in the good case.

But since both equilibria are in equilibrium, and rational players can coordinate, the **expected payoff** under rational play is 5 in both cases.

But — here’s another angle: **if you sign the contract, does it commit you to not playing A1?**

Not exactly — but in equilibrium, you don’t.

But consider: **if you sign the contract, you cannot get more than 5**, just like before.

But in base game, could you get more than 5?

No. Maximum is 5.

So no improvement.

But let’s compare the **worst-case**.

In base game:
- If you play A0, best: 5 (if P1 plays A0)
- Worst: 0 (if P1 plays A1)

But if you play A1: best 3, worst 3.

But if P1 plays A1, and you play A0, you get 0.

But with contract: if P1 plays A1, you get 2 (if you play A0), or 1 (if you play A1).

So the worst-case when you play A0 is **2**, better than 0.

But you don’t want to play A0 if P1 plays A1? No — 2 > 0.

But in base game, if P1 plays A1, you get 0 if you play A0, 3 if you play A1.

So you would play A1.

But in contract game, you get 1 if you play A1, 2 if you play A0.

So you play A0.

So in contract game:
- You play A0 for sure
- P1 plays A0 for sure
- You get 5

In base game:
- You could play A0, and P1 could play A0 → you get 5

But if P1 plays A1, you get 0.

But if P1 is rational, and you play A0, P1 should play A0.

So again, coordination.

So why would you risk getting only 3 or 0?

You wouldn’t.

So under rational play, both games give you 5.

So **no benefit** from signing.

But wait — **what if Player 1 is not rational**?

But the game assumes rational players.

And the contract seems to **not harm you**, but also **not help** you.

But here’s the **real advantage**: the contract **forces coordination on (A0,A0)**, which is better for everyone.

But in base game, (A0,A0) is already a stable equilibrium.

So signing doesn’t improve your payoff.

But what if you **could commit** to A0?

No, you don’t need to.

But let’s suppose that without the contract, **players might play A1 out of fear**.

But in this game, no.

Another idea: maybe the contract makes **A1 less attractive** for Player 1.

But in base game, if you play A0, Player 1 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → so he prefers A0.

So no issue.

Wait — in base game, if you play A0, P1 gets 5 if he plays A0, 3 if he plays A1 → so he plays A0.

So no deviation.

Thus, **both games lead to (A0,A0)**.

So you get 5 in both.

So signing the contract gives you **no benefit, no cost**.

But the contract **does not worsen your payoff**.

However, **the question is**: should you sign?

But if you sign, and Player 1 doesn't, the contract doesn't apply.

If you don't sign, the contract doesn't apply.

So signing **only matters** if Player 1 also signs.

But if Player 1 is rational, **he will sign**, because the contract:

- If P1 plays A0: no cost → gets 5
- If P1 plays A1: loses 2 points (but gains 2 from you), but in base game he gets 3, in contract game he gets 3−2=1 if you play A0, or 1 if you play A1.

In contract game, when P1 plays A1:
- If you play A0: he gets 1
- If you play A1: he gets 1

In base game: if he plays A1:
- If you play A0: he gets 3
- If you play A1: he gets 3

So **in contract game, P1 gets 1 instead of 3 when playing A1**, and in A0 he gets 5 (same).

So **P1 is worse off if he plays A1**, but he doesn't want to play A1 anyway.

But the contract reduces his payoff from 3 to 1 when he plays A1 — **bad for him**.

So **P1 will not want to sign the contract**.

Because it makes his worst-case worse, and even if he plays A0, it’s fine, but if he mistakenly plays A1, he loses 2.

But he might think: "if I play A0, I get 5 anyway; if I play A1, I get 1 instead of 3."

So he **prefers not to sign**, because signing makes him worse off when he plays A1.

And he controls his own action, so he might **not sign**.

Therefore, Player 1 will likely **not sign** the contract.

So if you sign, but P1 doesn’t, the contract doesn't apply.

So you still play base game.

And in base game, you can get 5.

But if you don’t sign, you also get 5.

So no difference.

But here's a catch: if **you sign**, and P1 doesn't, does that hurt you?

No.

But if **you don’t sign**, and P1 signs, still no contract.

But P1 likely won't sign.

So unless you can **force** the contract, and hope that P1 signs, it won’t happen.

But since you are deciding whether to sign, and you know that P1 likely won't sign (because it hurts him when he plays A1), then **the contract will not be in effect**.

Therefore, **signing the contract does nothing** — you still play the base game.

So you can get 5 either way.

But is there a better outcome?

No.

But in the base game, if you play A1 and P1 plays A0, you get 3.

But if you play A0 and P1 plays A1, you get 0.

But with contract, if you play A0 and P1 plays A1, you get 2.

So you are **protected** from getting 0.

But in equilibrium, P1 won't play A1.

So risk is low.

But if there is uncertainty, the contract provides **risk mitigation**: you can’t get 0.

You are guaranteed at least 1 (if you play A1).

But best is still 5.

But since you can get 5 in both cases, and signing doesn't change that, and if you sign and P1 doesn't, it’s useless, and P1 likely won't sign, then signing is not beneficial.

But here’s the **final insight**:

If you **sign**, and P1 **does** sign, then the contract applies.

But if P1 signs, he gets lower payoffs when he plays A1.

So he **does not want to sign**, because he might play A1 by mistake or against his better judgment.

So **P1 will not sign**.

Therefore, **contract will not be active**.

So signing it is pointless.

Your best strategy is not to sign.

But wait — what if you **don’t sign**, and P1 signs? Then contract doesn't apply either.

So only if both sign.

But P1 won't sign.

So you cannot get the contract active.

Therefore, **signing has no value**.

But is there any reason to sign?

No.

In fact, if you sign, and P1 signs (unlikely), you might get the same 5.

But no gain.

But here's a twist: could the contract **change your strategy**?

No — in base game, you prefer A0 if P1 plays A0, but if P1 plays A1, you prefer A1 (3 > 0).

But with contract, you prefer A0 even if P1 plays A1 (2 > 1).

So you are more likely to play A0.

But in equilibrium, you do anyway.

So no change.

Conclusion: **signing the contract does not increase your expected payoff.**

But there is a **cost** to you: if the contract were active, you would be worse off if you played A1 (lose 2), but you wouldn’t play it anyway.

So no benefit.

And since P1 likely won't sign, it won’t activate.

So you should not sign.

But wait — what if the contract changes the equilibrium in your favor? It doesn't.

Final answer: **do not sign**.

But earlier we said payoff is 5 in both cases.

But in base game, if players are not coordinated, they might play (A1,A1) → you get 3.

In contract game, (A1,A1) is not equilibrium — you get 1, so you won't play it.

So contract eliminates the bad equilibrium.

So under **uncertainty about coordination**, the contract **increases your expected payoff** by making (A0,A0) the only possible equilibrium.

For example, if players randomize or are not coordinated, then:

- In base game: if both randomize, you might get less.
- But in contract game, A0 is dominant, so players will play A0.

So the contract **improves coordination**, reduces the risk of (A1,A1).

Therefore, if you expect coordination risk, the contract increases your expected payoff.

But since (A0,A0) is a strict equilibrium, coordination is likely.

But to be safe, the contract **locks everyone into the good equilibrium**.

But in this case, the contract doesn't change the payoffs in the good equilibrium.

But it makes you **safe** from the bad one.

So if you care about robustness, you might want it.

But output is: {"sign": false}

Because:
- The contract does not increase your payoff in equilibrium.
- P1 has no incentive to sign.
- So contract won't be active.
- No net benefit.
- And you avoid any potential risk of being locked into a game where you might be penalized, though you won't play A1 anyway.

But actually, in the contract game, you are even better off: you can’t get less than 1.

But in base game, you could get 0.

So if you are risk-averse, contract is better.

But the goal is to **maximize expected points**, not minimize variance.

But if you are risk-averse, you want to maximize expected utility, which might depend.

But the problem says "maximize your total points", so it's risk-neutral.

Thus, expected payoff is 5 in both cases.

So no difference.

But if you can get higher than 5, you should.

But you can't.

So indifferent.

But the contract doesn't harm you.

So you could sign.

But why would you?

Unless you believe P1 will sign.

But P1 has no incentive.

So likely won't.

Therefore, signing is pointless.

Best to not sign.

Final decision: **do not sign**

You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:

- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand my payoff structure (as Player 2)

From my perspective:
- If I choose A0: I get 5 (if opponent plays A0) or 0 (if opponent plays A1)
- If I choose A1: I get 3 (if opponent plays A0) or 3 (if opponent plays A1)

## Step 2: Analyze strategic options

**Key observation:** A1 gives me a guaranteed 3 points regardless of opponent's choice, while A0 is risky (either 5 or 0).

Let me calculate when each action is better. If opponent plays A0 with probability p:
- Expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- Expected payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

A0 is better when 5p > 3, meaning p > 0.6
A1 is better when p < 0.6

## Step 3: Identify equilibria

This game has:
1. **(A0, A0) - Payoff-dominant equilibrium:** Both get 5 (best mutual outcome)
2. **(A1, A1) - Risk-dominant equilibrium:** Both get 3 (safer)
3. **Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium:** Both play 60% A0, 40% A1 (expected payoff: 3)

## Step 4: Consider the contract situation

The contract I proposed (but then rejected) would have discouraged A1. My rejection might signal:
- Uncertainty about cooperation
- Desire to maintain flexibility

This creates some ambiguity about my intentions, which could make the opponent cautious.

## Step 5: Choose optimal strategy

Given:
- No binding agreement (contract rejected)
- One-shot game with uncertainty
- Need to balance risk vs. reward

The **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (60% A0, 40% A1)** is a reasonable middle ground:
- Maintains flexibility
- Doesn't fully commit to the risky A0
- Doesn't give up on the higher payoff entirely

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Understand the Original Game

**Original payoff matrix (My payoff, Other's payoff):**
```
               Other: A0    Other: A1
My A0:         (5, 5)       (0, 3)
My A1:         (3, 0)       (3, 3)
```

This game has two Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → (5, 5) - better outcome
- (A1, A1) → (3, 3) - worse outcome

There's a coordination problem: we both want (A0, A0), but there's risk of miscoordination.

## Step 2: Calculate Payoffs WITH the Contract

The contract adds: "If a player chooses A1, they pay 3 points to the other player."

**Modified payoff matrix:**
```
               Other: A0    Other: A1
My A0:         (5, 5)       (3, 0)
My A1:         (0, 3)       (3, 3)
```

Calculations:
- (A0, A0): 5 + 0 = 5 for me
- (A0, A1): 0 + 3 (received from other) = 3 for me  
- (A1, A0): 3 - 3 (paid) = 0 for me
- (A1, A1): 3 - 3 (paid) + 3 (received) = 3 for me

## Step 3: Analyze Strategic Impact

**Without contract:**
- If other plays A1, I get 0 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → prefer A1
- Risk of both converging to inferior (A1, A1) equilibrium

**With contract:**
- If other plays A1, I get 3 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → indifferent
- If other plays A0, I get 5 from A0 vs 0 from A1 → strongly prefer A0
- A0 becomes my (nearly) dominant strategy!

## Step 4: Evaluate Benefits

The contract:
1. **Improves my worst case**: When other plays A1, I now get 3 instead of 0
2. **Strengthens coordination**: Makes (A0, A0) the clear focal point
3. **Punishes defection**: Playing A1 when other plays A0 drops my payoff from 3 to 0
4. **Eliminates downside risk**: Protects against being exploited

Expected outcome with contract: Strong coordination on (A0, A0) giving me 5 points.

## Conclusion

The contract clearly benefits me by:
- Converting A0 into a dominant strategy
- Ensuring convergence to the better equilibrium (5, 5)
- Protecting me from exploitation

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

response:
To maximize my total points in this decision-making game, I need to first analyze the payoffs of the actions available to me and the other player.

Given the basic game rules and the payoff description, I'll evaluate the options step by step.

### Payoff Matrix Analysis

#### Payoff Matrix:
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: You get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

#### Analysis:
- Choosing A1 results in guaranteed 3 points for me whether the other player chooses A0 or A1.
- Choosing A0 results in the possibility of getting 5 points if the other player also chooses A0, but 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

Given that Player 2 rejected the contract which would penalize choosing A1, Player 2 might have an inclination to choose A1 more frequently in order to avoid the risk of getting 0 points.

However, not following the contract's influence directly, we should consider the strategic nature of the game:
1. If both players act rationally and choose A0, each of us gets 5 points.
2. If both players choose A1, we both get 3 points.

By the projections and the dominant strategies that game theory often suggest when no clear cooperative signals (contract acceptance) are in place:

- If the other player believes I will choose A0 to maximize my points assuming they will also play for the higher cooperative gain 5 points, but distrust leads them to choose A1 to ensure they don't get 0, then I should balance my decision not to entirely depend either.

Thus, my strategy should reasonably spread between the safe secure of choosing A1 and the cooperative ideal choice A0 with a non-binary balanced distribution.

### Final Decision:
Based on the payoff structure and potential rational thought process of the other player, I’ll choose probabilities that give me an average weighted expectation.
So, it's rational to weigh equally on choice to hedge potential downside from the other's definitive strategy 50-50%.

### JSON Object:
```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

This distribution reflects the mixed strategy to balance potentially higher points if the other player cooperates or safely moderate return otherwise.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## Step 1: Understanding the Modified Payoffs

Let me first incorporate the contract into the payoff matrix. The contract states:
- A0: no additional payment
- A1: pay 3 points to the other player

**Original payoffs → Modified payoffs (with contract):**

| My Action | Other's Action | My Payoff | Other's Payoff |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| A0 | A0 | 5 + 0 = **5** | 5 + 0 = **5** |
| A0 | A1 | 0 + 3 (receive) = **3** | 3 - 3 (pay) = **0** |
| A1 | A0 | 3 - 3 (pay) = **0** | 0 + 3 (receive) = **3** |
| A1 | A1 | 3 - 3 + 3 = **3** | 3 - 3 + 3 = **3** |

## Step 2: Analyzing My Best Responses

**If the other player chooses A0:**
- My payoff from A0: 5
- My payoff from A1: 0
- **Best response: A0**

**If the other player chooses A1:**
- My payoff from A0: 3
- My payoff from A1: 3
- **Best response: Indifferent (both equal)**

## Step 3: Finding Nash Equilibria

Checking for Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: If they play A0, I prefer A0 (5>0). If I play A0, they prefer A0 (5>0). ✓ **Nash equilibrium with payoff (5,5)**
- **(A1, A1)**: If they play A1, I'm indifferent. If I play A1, they're indifferent. ✓ **Nash equilibrium with payoff (3,3)**

## Step 4: Strategic Reasoning

The key insights:
1. The contract was **proposed by me** and **approved** - this signals cooperative intent
2. (A0, A0) gives both players 5 points - the **best possible outcome**
3. (A1, A1) gives both players only 3 points - inferior to cooperation
4. The contract was specifically designed to make mutual cooperation (A0, A0) the attractive focal point

Since:
- A0 strictly dominates A1 when the other player plays A0
- I have no incentive to deviate from A0 if they play A0
- The approved contract signals commitment to cooperation
- Any rational player recognizing this structure should choose A0

## Step 5: Optimal Strategy

The rational choice is to play **A0 with 100% probability** to:
- Maximize expected payoff (5 points vs 3 or 0)
- Honor the cooperative signal of the approved contract
- Coordinate on the Pareto-dominant Nash equilibrium

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Original Game

Without the contract, the payoff matrix is:
```
                Other: A0    Other: A1
Me: A0             5, 5         0, 3
Me: A1             3, 0         3, 3
```

The original game has:
- Two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding 5 points each, and (A1, A1) yielding 3 points each
- A coordination problem: both players prefer (A0, A0), but there's risk if we fail to coordinate

## Step 2: Analyze Payoffs WITH the Contract

If the contract is signed, when a player chooses A0, they get +10 points from the other player.

New payoff matrix:
```
                Other: A0         Other: A1
Me: A0        5+10-10 = 5      0+10 = 10
Me: A1        3-10 = -7        3
```
- (A0, A0): I get 5, other gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 10, other gets -7
- (A1, A0): I get -7, other gets 10
- (A1, A1): I get 3, other gets 3

## Step 3: Find Optimal Strategy with Contract

Let me check if A0 dominates A1:
- When other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me -7 → A0 is better
- When other plays A1: A0 gives me 10, A1 gives me 3 → A0 is better

**A0 is strictly dominant!** The same logic applies to the other player.

## Step 4: Compare Outcomes

**With contract (if both sign):**
- Both players will play A0 (strictly dominant)
- Guaranteed outcome: 5 points for me

**Without contract:**
- Best case: coordinate on (A0, A0) → 5 points
- But risk of miscoordination or ending up at worse equilibrium (A1, A1) → 3 points

## Step 5: Decision

The contract:
- Guarantees my best possible outcome (5 points)
- Eliminates coordination risk
- Makes A0 strictly dominant, removing strategic uncertainty

Since signing gives me the same best outcome with no coordination risk, while not signing keeps the coordination problem, I should sign.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

The contract adds a penalty: if a player chooses A1, they pay 3 points to the other player.

Modified payoffs for me (Player 1):
- **(A0, A0)**: Base 5 + no payments = **5 points**
- **(A0, A1)**: Base 0 + receive 3 from other = **3 points**
- **(A1, A0)**: Base 3 - pay 3 to other = **0 points**
- **(A1, A1)**: Base 3 - pay 3 + receive 3 = **3 points**

## Step 2: Analyze strategic dominance

Comparing my payoffs:
- When other plays A0: A0 gives me 5, A1 gives me 0 → A0 is better
- When other plays A1: A0 gives me 3, A1 gives me 3 → Equal

**A0 weakly dominates A1** - it's always at least as good, and sometimes strictly better.

## Step 3: Identify Nash equilibria

The payoff matrix is symmetric, so the other player faces the same incentives.

Pure strategy equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: Payoffs (5,5) - neither player wants to deviate (would get 0)
- **(A1, A1)**: Payoffs (3,3) - neither player gains by deviating (would still get 3)

## Step 4: Choose optimal strategy

Since:
1. A0 weakly dominates A1 (never worse, sometimes better)
2. (A0, A0) gives the highest possible payoff of 5
3. Even in the worst case where the other player plays A1, I still get 3 from A0

The rational choice is to play **A0 with 100% probability**.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (No Contract)

The game is symmetric in structure, but we are playing as **Player 2** (the one who rejected the contract, which is important later).

The payoff matrix (from **Player 2's perspective**) is:

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0        | A1        |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**              | 5         | 0         |
| **A1**              | 3         | 3         |

Let’s label:
- Player 1 chooses A0 with probability p
- Player 2 (you) chooses A0 with probability q

Your expected payoff (as Player 2) is:

- If you choose A0:
  - With prob p: Player 1 chooses A0 → you get 5
  - With prob (1-p): Player 1 chooses A1 → you get 0  
  → Expected payoff: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p

- If you choose A1:
  - With prob p: Player 1 chooses A0 → you get 3
  - With prob (1-p): Player 1 chooses A1 → you get 3  
  → Expected payoff: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

So your expected payoff:
- A0: 5p
- A1: 3

You should choose A0 if 5p > 3 → p > 3/5 = 0.6
You should choose A1 if 5p < 3 → p < 0.6
You are indifferent if p = 0.6

This means that from your perspective, **your best response is:**
- A0 if Player 1 plays A0 with p > 0.6
- A1 if Player 1 plays A0 with p < 0.6
- Mix if p = 0.6

Now, what should **Player 1** do?

Let’s look at Player 1’s payoffs:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0        | A1        |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**              | 5         | 3         |
| **A1**              | 0         | 3         |

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If Player 1 chooses A0: 5q + 3(1-q) = 5q + 3 - 3q = 2q + 3
- If Player 1 chooses A1: 0*q + 3*(1-q) = 3 - 3q

Best response:
- A0 if 2q + 3 > 3 - 3q → 5q > 0 → q > 0
- But actually:  
  Set 2q + 3 > 3 - 3q → 5q > 0 → q > 0 → always true unless q = 0

Wait, that would suggest A0 is always better?

Wait — let’s compute carefully:

Compare:
- A0: 2q + 3
- A1: 3 - 3q

Set them equal:
2q + 3 = 3 - 3q  
2q + 3q = 0  
5q = 0 → q = 0

So:
- If q > 0 → A0 is better
- If q < 0 → impossible
- At q = 0: both give payoff 3

So Player 1’s best response:
- Always play A0 unless q = 0 → but even at q = 0, A0 and A1 give same payoff: 3

So Player 1 has a **strict dominant strategy** to play A0 — because for any q > 0, A0 gives higher payoff (2q + 3 > 3), and at q = 0, both are equal.

Thus, **Player 1 will play A0 with probability 1**.

---

### Step 2: What’s the Nash equilibrium?

Since Player 1’s dominant strategy is to play A0 with probability 1, then p = 1.

Now, what should you (Player 2) do?

Your expected payoff:
- A0: 5p = 5*1 = 5
- A1: 3

So **you should choose A0**, because 5 > 3.

Thus, in the unique Nash equilibrium, Player 1 plays A0 with prob 1, Player 2 plays A0 with prob 1.

Even if you deviate to A1, you only get 3 instead of 5.

So optimal strategy for you is to play A0 with 100% probability.

---

### Step 3: What about the ignored contract?

The contract says:
- If you choose A1, you pay 2 points, split among other players.
- But here, **Player 2 rejected it**, so it is **not active**.
You are playing the **original game**, **without** the contract.

So you **do not** have to pay 2 points for choosing A1.

Therefore, the contract has no effect on your decisions.

You can ignore it.

---

### Step 4: Final Decision

You should play **A0 with 100% probability** to maximize your payoff.

This is optimal whether or not the contract was active — in fact, even **with** the contract, A1 would be worse (you’d get 3 - 2 = 1 point if you choose A1 and other plays A0, or 3 - 2 = 1 if both A1), but here you don’t face that cost.

So in the original game, you clearly prefer A0.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Let's carefully break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)

We are in a simultaneous two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| **A1**              | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

This is a classic coordination game with a tension between cooperation and self-interest.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria.

- If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 prefers A0 (5 > 3)
- If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 is indifferent between A0 (0) and A1 (3) → prefers A1
- If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 prefers A0 (5 > 3)
- If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 prefers A1 (3 > 0)

So:
- (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium (mutual best response)
- (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium (both get 3, and neither wants to unilaterally deviate)
- (A0, A1) and (A1, A0) are not equilibria (someone wants to deviate)

So there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). The first gives higher payoff to both, so (A0, A0) is Pareto superior.

However, in the absence of communication or commitment, agents might fall into (A1, A1), especially if they are risk-averse or don’t coordinate.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Contract Mechanism

A **payment contract** can be introduced, **if both players approve it via an approval voting process**.

- The contract specifies **additional payments for choosing actions A0 or A1**.
- These payments are **in addition to the base payoff**.
- The payments are **drawn equally from the other player** — so if one player pays the other, it's a transfer between them, not an external source.
- The **contract is selected uniformly at random from all contracts that have the maximum number of approvals**.

Your goal: **Maximize your total expected points**, including base payoffs and any contract payments.

You are **Player 1**, and you must decide whether to **approve** or **disapprove** each contract.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Proposed Contracts

#### Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1 (You)

> - If a player chooses A0: no additional payment.
> - If a player chooses A1: no additional payment.

So this contract **does nothing** — no transfer, no incentive change.

It's effectively **no contract**.

**What happens if you approve it?**
- You are not changing the game.
- But if the contract is approved by at least one other player, it could be selected (if it has max approvals).
- However, since it does nothing, it doesn’t affect payoffs.

So, **you get the same expected payoffs as without any contract**.

But does it *hurt* you? No — it’s neutral.
Does it *help* you? No — it's inactive.

Still, **approving a harmless contract doesn’t hurt you**, and might help if others also approve it and it becomes the winning contract (which it would be, if no other contract gets more approvals).

But since it’s neutral, approving it doesn’t affect your expected payoff.

So, is it worth approving?

Yes, **because it doesn't hurt you and increases the chance that the game proceeds under a contract**.

Also, since you’re the proposer, you likely want the game to proceed (especially if you think a better contract might be accepted), but here the only alternatives are C2.

So, you **should approve C1**, as it is costless and potentially helps in getting a contract selected.

> ✅ Approve C1

---

#### Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2

> - If a player chooses A0: they receive an additional payment of 4 points, **drawn equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1: no additional payment.

So, if *either player* plays A0, they get +4, and the other player loses 4 (since payment is "drawn equally from the other players" — interpreted as the cost is borne by the other player).

Let’s clarify "drawn equally from the other players": since it’s a two-player game, "equally" likely means the entire 4 points come from the other player.

So if you play A0, you get +4, and the other player loses 4.

If both play A0: you both get +4, and each loses 4 → net effect: both get 0 extra? Wait — that can’t be, because the contract says "drawn from the other players" — so if both play A0, each receives 4, but each has to pay 4 to the other?

Wait — that would be:

- Player 1 plays A0 → receives +4 from Player 2
- Player 2 plays A0 → receives +4 from Player 1

So total transfer: Player 1 gives 4 to Player 2, and Player 2 gives 4 to Player 1 → net zero for both.

But that’s only if we assume both are drawing from the other.

But the language is: "they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn equally from the other players" — so if **you** choose A0, the 4 is taken from the other player.

So:

- If you choose A0, you get +4, and the other player pays -4.
- If the other chooses A0, same.

So if you both choose A0:
- You get +4, and you pay -4 → net 0
- The other gets +4 and pays -4 → net 0

So no net change in payoff — but the base payoff still applies.

So the **net effect of the contract** depends on action.

Let’s compute **total payout under C2**, including base and contract.

We will compute the **total expected payoff for Player 1** under this contract, and compare it to the base game.

But first, let’s write the **total payoff matrix under C2**.

Let’s define:

- Base payoff + contract adjustment

Note: The contract is **activated based on chosen actions**, and applies to both players.

So for any player who plays A0, they get +4, and the opponent loses 4.

#### Payoff Matrix under C2 (Player 1, Player 2):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2 gets +4, P1 pays -4) | A1 (no change) |
|---------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| **A0**  | P1: base (5) - 4 = **1**, P2: base (5) + 4 = **9** | P1: base (0) - 4 = **-4**, P2: base (3) = **3** |
| **A1**  | P1: base (3) = **3**, P2: base (0) - 4 = **-4** | P1: base (3), P2: base (3) = **3** |

Wait — let’s clarify:

- If **you (P1) play A0**, then **you receive +4**, and the **other player (P2) pays -4**.
- If **P2 plays A0**, then P2 receives +4, and **P1 pays -4**.

So the adjustments are:

| P1 | P2 | P1's contract adjustment | P2's contract adjustment |
|----|----|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| A0 | A0 | +4 (from P2) → -4 if P2 plays A0 → but wait: if **you** play A0, and **they** play A0: you get +4 from P2, and P2 gets +4 from you → so you *add* +4, but *also* pay -4 → net 0?

Ah! **Here is the key ambiguity.**

Does the contract say:
- If you choose A0 → gain +4, and the other loses 4? (i.e., you are paid 4 by the other)
- OR does it mean: if you choose A0, you get +4, and *the other player loses 4*?

That is, **is the cost to the other player, or is it a transfer?**

The phrase: *"they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."*

"Drawn equally from the other players" — this suggests that the **source of the 4 points is the other player(s)**.

So if you choose A0, **you get +4**, and **the other player loses 4**.

Thus, the **net effect** is a transfer: **you gain 4, the other loses 4**.

So even if the other also plays A0, **each gets +4 and loses 4** → net 0 for both.

So **only one player plays A0**, the one getting +4, the other paying -4.

But if **both** play A0, then both receive +4, and both pay -4 → net 0.

So in summary:

- If P1 plays A0: P1 gets +4, P2 loses 4
- If P2 plays A0: P2 gets +4, P1 loses 4

These are **independent**.

So **total adjustment to Player 1**:

- +4 if P1 plays A0
- -4 if P2 plays A0

So **total adjustment = +4 (if P1 plays A0) -4 (if P2 plays A0)**

Similarly for Player 2.

Thus, **P1's total payoff = base payoff + [if P1 played A0: +4] + [if P2 played A0: -4]**

So the **full adjusted payoff matrix** for Player 1:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2 plays A0 → P1 pays -4) | A1 (no change) |
|---------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **A0**  | base: 5 + 4 (from self) - 4 (P2) = **5** | base: 0 + 4 (self) = **4** |
| **A1**  | base: 3 - 4 (P2) = **-1** | base: 3 = **3** |

Similarly for Player 2:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|-----|-----|
| A0     | 5 + 4 - 4 = 5 | 3 |
| A1     | 0 + 4 = 4 | 3 |

Wait, let's redo for Player 2:

- P2 gets +4 if P2 plays A0
- P2 loses 4 if P1 plays A0

So:

- (A0, A0): base 5 + 4 - 4 = 5
- (A0, A1): base 3 + 4 = 7? Wait no:

Wait! (A0, A1): P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1

- P2 plays A1 → no +4
- P1 plays A0 → P2 loses 4
- Base payoff for P2: 3
- So total: 3 - 4 = **-1**

Similarly:

- (A1, A0): P2 plays A0 → +4, P1 plays A1 → no effect on P2 → so P2: 0 (base) + 4 = **4**
- (A1, A1): both play A1 → no change → 3

So full matrix for **Player 2**:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 5 - 4 = **1** | 3 - 4 = **-1** |
| **A1**  | 0 + 4 = **4** | 3        |

Wait, now we have a contradiction.

Hold on — the contract is applied **per player**.

The clause says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive +4, drawn from the other player."

So for **Player 2**:

- They receive +4 **if they choose A0**, **regardless** of what P1 does.
- They lose 4 **if P1 chooses A0**, because P1’s A0 implies P2 pays 4.

So:

- (P1=A0, P2=A0): P2 gets +4 (from their own A0), but loses 4 (because P1 played A0) → net 0 additional.
  - Base: 5 → total: 5
- (P1=A0, P2=A1): P2 gets no +4 (played A1), but loses 4 (because P1 played A0) → net -4
  - Base: 3 → total: -1
- (P1=A1, P2=A0): P2 gets +4 (from A0), no loss (P1 didn’t play A0) → net +4
  - Base: 0 → total: 4
- (P1=A1, P2=A1): no effect → base: 3 → total: 3

So Player 2's adjusted payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 5 | -1 |
| A1     | 4 | 3 |

Player 1's adjusted payoffs:

- (A0, A0): +4 (from self A0) -4 (P2 A0) → net 0 → total: 5 + 0 = 5
- (A0, A1): +4 (self) - 0 (P2 not A0) → +4 → total: 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1, A0): 0 (no self A0) -4 (P2 A0) → -4 → total: 3 - 4 = -1
- (A1, A1): 0 → 3

So Player 1 matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|----|----|
| A0     | 5 | 4 |
| A1     | -1 | 3 |

So now the game under C2 is:

**Player 1:**
- If P2 plays A0 → P1 prefers A0 (5 > -1)
- If P2 plays A1 → P1 prefers A0 (4 > 3)

So **A0 dominates A1** for Player 1.

Player 2:
- P2 prefers A0 if P1 plays A0 → 5 > -1
- P2 prefers A1 if P1 plays A1 → 3 > 4? No, 3 < 4 → so prefers A1

So:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 plays A0
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 plays A1

So (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are both equilibria.

But what's best for **you (Player 1)**?

In (A0, A0): you get **5**
In (A1, A1): you get **3**

So you prefer (A0, A0), and **A0 dominates**, so you'll likely end up at (A0, A0) — **your preferred outcome**.

Even better: **if you believe that the other player will play optimally**, then:
- If you play A0 → P2 will play A0 → you get 5
- If you play A1 → P2 will play A1 → you get 3

So you should play A0.

Thus, under C2, you can **guarantee** 5 points.

In the original game, the best you can guarantee is **3** (by playing A1, in case of (A1, A1)).

But in the base game, (A0, A0) is also an equilibrium, but it’s less secure — if P2 plays A1, you get 0.

So **C2 creates a dominant strategy for you to play A0**, and if P2 plays optimally, you end up at (A0, A0) → **5 points**, which is the highest possible.

But is Player 2 willing to go along?

Let’s check **Player 2's incentives under C2**.

We saw:
- If you (P1) play A0 → P2 plays A0 → gets 5
- If you play A1 → P2 plays A1 → gets 3
- So P2 prefers A0 only if P1 plays A0

But if P2 plays A0, P1 will play A0 (since A0 dominates), so P2 is fine.

So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium: both are playing best responses.

Also, (A1, A1): P1 plays A1 → P2 plays A1 (3 > 0? Wait, P2's payoffs:

- P2 plays A1: gets 3
- P2 plays A0: gets -1

So P2 prefers A1 when P1 plays A1.

So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But Player 2 gets 3 in (A1, A1), but **5** in (A0, A0), so P2 **prefers (A0, A0)**.

So both players prefer (A0, A0) under C2.

Moreover, since **A0 is dominant for Player 1**, and **A0 is best for Player 2 when P1 plays A0**, it’s very likely that (A0, A0) occurs.

Thus, you get **5 points** under C2.

In the original game, you might get 5 (if both play A0), but also might get 0 or 3.

So **C2 significantly improves your expected payoff** by **locking in coordination on (A0, A0)**.

But — can Player 2 **benefit** from C2?

Player 2 gets:
- In (A0, A0): 5 → same as original
- In (A1, A1): 3 → same as original
- But now, no chance of getting 0

So **Player 2 is also better off** under C2: no chance of getting 0 (if P1 plays A0), and they’re guaranteed at least 3.

So Player 2 **should approve C2**, since it improves their security and they can still get 5.

So **C2 is beneficial for both**.

However, there is a catch: **you are only deciding whether you approve it**.

Player 2 may or may not approve.

But your goal is to **maximize your own payoff**, **assuming the contract is selected if it gets maximum approvals**.

So if you **approve C2**, and Player 2 also approves, then C2 may win (since it has 2 approvals, vs C1's 1 if you approve only C1, etc.).

But note: **multiple contracts can be approved**, and the one with **maximum approvals** wins (randomly if tie).

Now, let’s suppose:

- You approve C1 and C2 → 2 approvals
- Player 2 approves C2 → 1 approval

Then C1 has 1, C2 has 2 → C2 wins.

If you only approve C2, and Player 2 approves C2 → C2 wins.

If you don’t approve C2, and Player 2 does, then C2 has 1, C1 has 1 (if you approve C1), so tie → one picked at random.

But you **want to maximize your payoff**, so you want **C2 to be selected if possible**.

So **you should approve C2**, because it gives you **5 points** (with high probability, or even guaranteed if both play optimally).

And **C1** gives you **nothing extra**, just the base game.

So **C2 is strictly better for you**.

But is **C2 worth approving even if Player 2 might not approve**?

Yes — because if you approve C2, and Player 2 also approves, C2 wins → you get 5.

If you don’t approve C2, and Player 2 does, then C2 has 1 approval, C1 has 1 (if you approve C1) → tie → **random selection**, so you have **50% chance of getting C2 (5 points), 50% getting C1 (base game, say 3-4 expected)**.

So **you are worse off if you don’t approve C2**, because you **reduce the chance** that C2 is selected.

Moreover, **approving C2 increases the chance that C2 wins**, even if Player 2 doesn’t approve — no, wait: Player 2 must approve for C2 to have an approval.

But if **you** don’t approve it, it can't win, unless Player 2 approves and you don’t — then C2 has 1, C1 has 1 → random → you still have 50% chance to get C2.

But if **you do approve C2**, and Player 2 approves — C2 wins.

So:
- If you approve C2, and Player 2 approves C2 → C2 wins → you get 5
- If you approve C2, and Player 2 **doesn’t** → then C2 has 1 approval (yours), C1 has 1 → tie → C2 has 50% chance → you get 5 with 50% chance, base game with 50%

But if you **don’t approve C2**, then:
- C2 has 0 (or 1 if Player 2 doesn't approve) → at most 1
- C1 has 1 (if you approve it) → so C1 has 1, C2 has 0 → C1 wins

Wait: **if you don't approve C2**, then C2 has at most 1 (if Player 2 approves), and C1 has 1 (if you approve C1)

Then **C1 has 1**, C2 has 1 → tie → random selection → you get C2 with 50% chance.

But **if you do approve C2**, and Player 2 approves, C2 wins for sure.

So **approving C2 increases your chance to get 5**, even if Player 2 does not approve.

But if you **don’t approve C2**, then C2 cannot win unless you approve it — **but if you don't approve it, it has no chance of being selected**.

Wait — **approval** is required for a contract to be eligible.

So for C2 to be selected, **at least one player must approve it**.

But the **winning contract** is selected **from those with maximum approvals**.

So if:
- You approve C2, Player 2 does not → C2 has 1 approval
- You approve C1, Player 2 does not → C1 has 1
- Then both have 1 → tie → random → you get C2 with 50% chance

But if:
- You don’t approve C2, Player 2 approves → C2 has 1
- You approve C1 → C1 has 1
- Again, tie → 50% chance of C2

So **in both cases, you have 50% chance of getting C2**, if Player 2 approves.

But if **you approve C2**, then if Player 2 also approves, C2 wins (2 approvals > 1), so you get 5 for sure.

So **approving C2 gives a chance for you to guarantee 5**.

Whereas not approving it **gives at most 50% chance of getting 5**, even if Player 2 approves.

Moreover, **if Player 2 does NOT approve C2**, then C2 has 0 approvals → even if you approve it, it has 1 → C1 has 1 → tie → random.

So you still have 50% chance.

But if you approve C2, and Player 2 also approves → you get 5 for sure.

So **you are doing better when you approve C2**

Furthermore, **approving C2 is not costly to you** — because if the contract is not selected (e.g., only 1 approval), you still get the base game with 50% probability, same as if you didn’t approve it.

But when you approve it, you gain a **chance to get a higher payoff**.

Thus, **you should approve C2**.

Now, **should you approve C1?**

C1 does nothing.

If you don't approve C1, and no one else does, then no contract is selected — but wait: **the winning contract is selected from those that are approved**. If no contract is approved, the game proceeds with base payoffs?

But the problem says: “the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.”

So if **no contracts are approved**, then no contract wins → game reverts to base?

But the problem doesn't specify.

But let’s assume that **if no contract is approved, the base game proceeds**.

Now, if you approve C1 only, and Player 2 doesn't approve anything, then:
- C1 has 1 approval
- C2 has 0
- So C1 wins → no change

So you’re fine.

But if you **don’t approve C1**, and Player 2 approves C2, then:
- C2 has 1, C1 has 0 → C2 wins → you get 5
- If C1 has 0, C2 has 1 → C2 wins

So **if you don’t approve C1**, but Player 2 approves C2, C2 wins → you get 5

But if you **approve C1** and Player 2 approves C2, then both have 1 → tie → random → you get C2 with 50% chance → you get 5 only 50% of the time instead of 100%

So **approving C1 reduces your chance of getting C2**

Thus, **you should NOT approve C1**, because it **dilutes your chance of getting C2**.

Moreover, C1 gives nothing, so it’s worse.

### Final Decision:

- **C1**: Do **not** approve — because it reduces the chance of C2 being selected (by creating a tie), and doesn’t help you.
- **C2**: **Approve** — because it gives you a chance to get 5 points, and you should increase that chance.

Even if it doesn’t win, you’re not worse off than not approving it (because of the tie mechanic).

But you are **better off** by approving it, because you can **guarantee C2 if Player 2 approves**, which is better than random.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

response:
To decide which contracts to approve, we need to carefully assess the impact of each contract on the points earned in the game and how it affects the strategy.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Payoff Matrix without Contracts:**
   ```
      | A0   | A1
   ----|------|-----
   A0  | 5, 5 | 0, 3
   A1  | 3, 0 | 3, 3
   ```
   Player 2 is playing in this game setup to maximize their own points.

2. **Analysis of Proposed Contracts:**

   **Contract C1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
   - No additional payments for any actions.
   - The payoff matrix remains as it is:
     ```
        | A0   | A1
     ----|------|-----
     A0  | 5, 5 | 0, 3
     A1  | 3, 0 | 3, 3
     ```

   **Contract C2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
   - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point from the other player.
   - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional 1 point to the other player.
   - The new payoff matrix would be:
     ```
         | A0   | A1
      ----|------|-----
      A0  | 6, 4 | 1, 2
      A1  | 2, 1 | 2, 2
     ```

### Approval Decision Making

#### Expected Payoff under Each Contract:

- **Contract C1:**
  No changes to the original matrix.

- **Contract C2:**
  New Payoff Matrix:
  ```
     | A0   | A1
  ----|------|-----
  A0  | 6, 4 | 1, 2
  A1  | 2, 1 | 2, 2
  ```
  In this setup, if both players choose A0, Player 2 gets 4 points plus an additional 1 point, totaling 5 points, which is worse off compared to the original without any contracts where Player 2 would still get 5 points but with a symmetrical result overall.

#### Strategic Impact Assessment:

- **Contract C1:**
  No changes lead to only equilibrium decisions that players were making in the original setting. It remains fair and balanced with respect to both players frequently choosing A1.

- **Contract C2:**
  Incentivizes Player 2 highly to favor A0, because Player 2 gets more guaranteed points. This looks advantageous for points collection in a more predictable outcome, but it disrupts the symmetry of mutual decisions seen in Contract C1 thus might be countered by Player 1 through strategic play.

### Conclusion:

For Player 2 (your position), Contract C2 increases individual guaranteed payoffs but with strategic complexity in reactions from Player 1 potentially favoring.

### Final Approval JSON Output:

{
  "C1": false,
  "C2": true

response:
Step 1: Evaluate Contract C1 (no transfers)  
This leaves the original payoff matrix unchanged. The game has two pure Nash equilibria:  
- (A0, A0) giving me 5  
- (A1, A1) giving me 3  
So under C1 there is a coordination risk: we might end up at the lower-payoff equilibrium (A1, A1).

Step 2: Evaluate Contract C2 (A0 rewarded, A1 penalized, via transfers)  
Under C2, my net payoff changes due to both:
- my own action (A0 gives me +2; A1 costs me -2), and
- the other player’s action (if they play A0 I pay them 2; if they play A1 they pay me 2).

Compute my resulting payoffs:

- If P1=A0, P2=A0: base 5 +2 (I played A0) −2 (P1 played A0) = 5  
- If P1=A0, P2=A1: base 3 −2 (I played A1) −2 (P1 played A0) = -1  
- If P1=A1, P2=A0: base 0 +2 (I played A0) +2 (P1 played A1) = 4  
- If P1=A1, P2=A1: base 3 −2 (I played A1) +2 (P1 played A1) = 3  

So for me, A0 strictly dominates A1:
- If P1 plays A0: 5 > -1  
- If P1 plays A1: 4 > 3  

Thus, under C2 I will choose A0 for sure, and the other player has the same incentives, making (A0, A0) the unique outcome, giving me 5 for sure (and avoiding coordination failure).

Step 3: Approval decision strategy  
Approving C1 in addition to C2 can only increase the chance that C1 is selected (e.g., if both of us approve C1, it can beat or tie C2 in approvals). Since C2 is strictly better for me (it guarantees the 5 outcome), I should **not** approve C1.

Final approvals:
```json
{"C1": false, "C2": true}

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

We are playing a simultaneous move game where each player chooses between A0 and A1, based on a probability distribution. The payoffs are:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Payoff | Other Player's Payoff |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5            | 5                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0            | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3            | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 3            | 3                      |

This is a **coordination game with a conflict of interest**:

- If both play A0, both get 5 → best for both.
- If both play A1, both get 3 → worse than 5.
- If you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0, they get 3.  
- If you play A1 and the other plays A0, you get 3, they get 0.

So, there is **a coordination incentive toward A0**, but also **a temptation to defect to A1** to get 3 instead of 0, **if the other plays A0**.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Best Responses Without Contracts**

Let’s find Nash equilibria in pure strategies:

- (A0, A0): If you deviate to A1, your payoff drops from 5 to 3 → no incentive. If the other deviates to A1, their payoff drops from 5 to 3 → no incentive. **So (A0,A0) is a Nash equilibrium.**
- (A1,A1): If you deviate to A0, you get 0 (instead of 3) → bad. So no incentive to deviate. **(A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.**
- (A0,A1): You get 0; if you switch to A1, you get 3 → so you want to deviate → not equilibrium.
- (A1,A0): You get 3; if you switch to A0, you get 5 → so you want to deviate → not equilibrium.

So **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

Now, in a symmetric game like this, the **Pareto-efficient** equilibrium is (A0,A0), since it gives 5 each, vs 3 each in (A1,A1).

But players might get stuck in (A1,A1) if they don’t coordinate — and in fact, (A1,A1) can be *more stable* if there's a fear of being exploited.

But note: the game is **not a prisoner’s dilemma**, because in that case, defecting (A1) dominates (A0). Here it does **not** dominate — if the other plays A0, you do better with A1 (3 > 0), but if the other plays A1, you’re indifferent (3 vs 3). So A1 does **not** strictly dominate A0.

Still, the concern is coordination: *will both players pick A0?*

Without a contract, (A0,A0) can be a solution via mutual understanding, but (A1,A1) is also an equilibrium. So without coordination, players might fail to coordinate on the better outcome.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Contract System**

- A contract can be proposed.
- Players **approve** or **disapprove** contracts via approval voting.
- The **winning contract** is chosen **uniform at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.
- You are **Player 2**.

So **you only care about whether a contract is approved**, and **you want to approve contracts that help you maximize your expected payoff**.

The contract adds **additional payments** (could be negative, i.e., taxes).

Governed by the contract’s specification.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Proposed Contracts**

---

#### **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1**

> - If a player chooses A0, no additional payments.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 3 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Note: "distributed equally among the other players" — since there are 2 players, if you play A1, you pay 3, and the other player gets 3.

But **who is getting paid?**

Let’s suppose you play A1, then:
- You pay 3 points (so you lose 3),
- The **other player receives 3**.

This is a **cost to self for playing A1**, and **benefit to opponent** when you do so.

Let’s evaluate the **new payoff structure** under C1.

Let’s compute expected payoffs for each player, depending on their choice.

But note: **you are Player 2**, so:

Let’s define your strategy: choose A0 or A1 with some probability (but since you choose based on incentives, we’re looking at best response).

Assume the other player (Player 1) also chooses based on incentives.

But you’re trying to pick contracts that **you** approve.

For **C1**, we must ask: **Would you approve of this contract?**

Approving a contract means you believe it will **improve your expected payoff**, or at least not hurt it.

But remember: the contract becomes active **only if it is chosen**, and **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the most approvals**.

But since you are **only choosing approvals**, and not ensuring the contract passes, your best strategy is to approve contracts that **increase your expected payoff**, assuming the contract is selected.

You have **no control over the other player’s choices**, but you can act based on incentives.

So ask: **Would C1 help or hurt me (Player 2)?**

Let’s evaluate the **new payoff matrix under C1**.

Note: C1 applies **to both players**.

Let’s compute the **total payoff** (base + contract) for each player.

---

#### **Payoff under C1: (base game + contract)**

- When a player plays A1, they **lose 3 points**, and the **other player gains 3 points**.

So for Player 2 (you):

| Your Action | Other's Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment (you) | Total Payoff |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| A0          | A0             | 5           | 0 (since you didn't choose A1) | 5            |
| A0          | A1             | 0           | +3 (because other player chose A1, so you get 3) | 3            |
| A1          | A0             | 3           | -3 (you chose A1, so you pay 3) | 0            |
| A1          | A1             | 3           | -3 (you chose A1) | 0            |

Wait: clarification — when you play A1, you **pay** 3 **to the other player**.

So:

- If you play A1: you subtract 3.
- If other player plays A1: you get +3.

So for each cell:

- (A0, A0): you get 5 (base) + 0 = **5**
- (A0, A1): you get 0 (base) + 3 (from other playing A1) = **3**
- (A1, A0): you get 3 (base) - 3 (you played A1) = **0**
- (A1, A1): you get 3 (base) - 3 (you played A1) = **0**

So the **new payoff matrix for you (Player 2)** is:

| Your Action | Other's Action | Your Total Payoff |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0             | 5                 |
| A0          | A1             | 3                 |
| A1          | A0             | 0                 |
| A1          | A1             | 0                 |

Similarly, for Player 1:

| Their Action | Your Action | Their Total Payoff |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| A0           | A0          | 5                  |
| A1           | A0          | 0                  |
| A0           | A1          | 0                  |
| A1           | A1          | 0                  |

Wait — no. Observe:

From C1: when **you** play A1, **you** pay 3, and **Player 1** gets that 3.

So for **Player 1**:

- If Player 1 plays A0: no cost.
- If Player 1 plays A1: pays 3 to you (Player 2).

So Player 1’s total payoff:

| P1 Action | You (P2) Action | Base | Contract (P1 loses 3 if P1 plays A1) | Total |
|-----------|------------------|-------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| A0        | A0               | 5     | 0                                    | 5      |
| A0        | A1               | 3     | 0                                    | 3      |
| A1        | A0               | 0     | -3                                   | -3     |
| A1        | A1               | 3     | -3                                   | 0      |

So P1’s payoffs:

- (A1, A0): -3
- (A1, A1): 0

So **P1 has a strong disincentive to play A1**, because if you play A0, they lose 3. Even if you play A1, they only get 0.

But **you (P2)** get:

- If you play A0: you get 5 if P1 plays A0, 3 if P1 plays A1.
- If you play A1: you get 0 in both cases.

So you have **no incentive to play A1**, because it always gives 0 for you, while A0 gives either 5 or 3.

So **your best choice is to always play A0 under C1**.

Now, what does **Player 1** want?

They get:
- 5 if both play A0
- 3 if they play A0 and you play A1
- -3 if they play A1 and you play A0
- 0 if both play A1

So if **you always play A0** (which seems rational for you under C1), then P1’s best response is to play A0 (get 5) rather than A1 (get -3).

Thus, **(A0,A0) is stable under C1**, and both players are better off.

Your expected payoff under C1 is **5** — since you play A0, and P1 plays A0.

Compare to base game: in base game, (A0,A0) is possible, but also (A1,A1) is possible. So expected payoff depends on coordination.

But **under C1**, **you are strongly incentivized to play A0**, and **P1 has no incentive to play A1 if they expect you to play A0**.

So C1 **induces coordination on A0**.

You get 5, which is better than the 3 you get in (A1,A1), and better than chance of 0 in miscoordination.

Thus, **C1 benefits you**.

So: **You should approve C1**.

---

#### **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2 (you)**

> - If a player chooses A0, no additional payments.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So **no changes at all**.

This is the **base game** — no contract.

So under C2, the payoff structure is exactly the same as the original game.

You face the same incentives.

You can still coordinate on (A0,A0), or slip into (A1,A1).

But **no change** in payoffs.

So whether you approve this or not, it doesn’t change your expected outcome.

But **you are allowed to approve it**.

Is there any reason **not** to approve C2?

Only if you believe it’s worse than some alternative — but since the contract isn't active unless selected, and you are trying to **maximize expected payoff**, you should approve **any contract that does not hurt you**.

C2 is **neutral**: it doesn't harm you, and doesn't help you.

But approval is **free**: you can approve it without cost.

So why would you **not** approve it?

- To prevent a less favorable contract from being chosen? But that’s not the mechanism — the contract is selected among **all with the highest number of approvals**, and you’re trying to **maximize your expected payoff**.

But if C2 is **indifferent** (same as base), and C1 is **better for you**, then you might approve **only C1**.

But is that justified?

Let’s think carefully.

- If you approve C2, then it has one approval (yours).
- If you approve only C1, then C1 has one approval, C2 has zero.
- So C1 would be the only candidate for winning.
- But if you approve C2, both C1 and C2 have 1 approval each → then **winning contract is chosen uniformly at random from {C1, C2}** → so **50% chance of C1, 50% chance of C2**.

Now, under C1: you get 5 (as analyzed).
Under C2: you get only what you would get in the base game.

But in the base game, **you could get 5**, **3**, or **0**, depending on what happens.

But without a contract, you cannot coordinate.

But **does C2 allow coordination?** Not really — it’s just the base game.

But if both players can coordinate, they might pick (A0,A0).

But if not, (A1,A1) could happen.

But **you want to maximize your expected payoff**.

So compare:

- If you **approve C1 only**, then C1 has 1 approval → C2 has 0 → C1 wins with probability 1 → you get 5.
- If you **approve both**, then C1 and C2 both have 1 approval → winner chosen at random → 50% C1 (you get 5), 50% C2 (you get expected base payoff).

What is the **expected payoff under base game**?

Let’s compute **your expected payoff under best-response strategy**.

In base game, suppose both players are rational.

(Nash equilibria: (A0,A0), (A1,A1)).

But corner solutions: (A0,A0) gives 5 each, (A1,A1) gives 3 each.

But players may not agree.

Or consider mixed strategies.

Let’s find mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let p = probability that Player 1 plays A0.

You (Player 2) play A0 with probability q.

But since symmetric, suppose both use same strategy.

Let p be probability of A0.

You want to find p such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Your expected payoff from A0:
- If P1 plays A0: you get 5
- If P1 plays A1: you get 0
→ So expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p

Your expected payoff from A1:
- If P1 plays A0: you get 3
- If P1 plays A1: you get 3
→ So 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5

So in symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each plays A0 with probability 3/5.

Then expected payoff for you: 3 (since both actions yield same expected payoff in equilibrium) → so **3 points**.

You could do better with coordination.

But in the absence of coordination, you get 3 on average.

Alternatively, if both coordinate on A0, you get 5.

But if they fail, you might get 3 (in (A1,A1)) or worse.

But in the **absence of any contract**, the **expected payoff is 3** under equilibrium.

Another possibility: **(A0,A0)** is safer if both agree.

But **we are not told** that players can communicate.

So we must assume **no communication**, so mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is the fallback.

So **under base game (C2)**, your expected payoff is **3**.

But under C1, you **get 5 for sure** — because the contract forces both players toward A0.

Thus, **C1 is strictly better than C2** for you.

Therefore:

- If you **approve only C1**, then C1 wins → you get 5.
- If you **approve both**, then there’s a 50% chance C1 (you get 5), 50% chance C2 (you get 3) → your **expected payoff = (5 + 3)/2 = 4**.

- If you **approve neither**, then **no contract is approved**, so **no contract selected** → but wait: what is the default?

The winning contract is selected from those with **maximum approvals**.

If **no one approves C1 or C2**, then maximum approvals is 0.

But C1 and C2 both have 0 approvals → so **any** contract with 0 approvals is in the pool → but **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with max approvals**.

But if both have 0, then you pick one at random? But no — the rules say: "the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if **all contracts have 0 approvals**, then **all contracts are in the pool**, so one is chosen uniformly.

So **C2** (the base game) would be selected with some positive probability.

But **you don’t know which one is selected**, so you have to compute the expected payoff.

But **if you approve neither**, then C1 and C2 both have 0 approvals → maximum is 0 → so winner is chosen uniformly at random — 50% C1, 50% C2.

Then your **expected payoff** = 0.5×5 + 0.5×3 = 4.

Same as when you approve both.

But if you approve only C1, you get 5.

So **your best option is to approve only C1**, so that C1 is the **only** contract with 1 approval → so it wins for sure → you get 5.

But what if **Player 1 also approves C1**? Then C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 1 (if you approve it), or 0.

But you don’t know what Player 1 does.

But **you are only deciding your own approvals**.

And **you want to maximize your expected payoff**.

But you don't know what Player 1 will do.

So you must **assume** that Player 1 will act in their own interest.

But **you don’t know** whether they will approve C1.

But from **C1’s perspective**, Player 1 **benefits** from C1?

Let’s check.

Under C1, what is **Player 1’s payoff**?

Earlier we computed:

- If P1 plays A0 and you play A0: 5
- If P1 plays A0 and you play A1: 3
- If P1 plays A1 and you play A0: -3
- If P1 plays A1 and you play A1: 0

So if P1 believes you will play A0 (which you will, as shown), then P1 gets:
- 5 if they play A0
- -3 if they play A1

So P1 **strongly prefers A0**.

So **P1 will want to play A0**, and **will have a strong incentive to approve C1**, because it helps them get 5 instead of risking -3 or 0.

So likely, **Player 1 approves C1**.

But **you don’t know for sure**.

But from **your perspective**, you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

So let’s consider:

### **Option 1: Approve only C1**

- If Player 1 approves C1 → C1 has 2 approvals, C2 has 0 → C1 wins → you get 5.
- If Player 1 does **not** approve C1 → C1 has 1 approval, C2 has 0 → C1 wins → you get 5.

So **regardless of Player 1’s choice**, **if you approve only C1**, then C1 has at least 1 approval, and **no contract has more than 1**, so C1 wins (if tied, random, but only C1 has 1).

So **C1 wins with probability 1** → you get **5**.

### **Option 2: Approve both C1 and C2**

- Then:
  - C1: 1 approval (you)
  - C2: 1 approval (you)
  - If Player 1 approves C1 only → C1 has 2, C2 has 1 → C1 wins → you get 5
  - If Player 1 approves C2 only → C2 has 2, C1 has 1 → C2 wins → you get 3
  - If Player 1 approves both → both C1 and C2 have 2 → max = 2 → chosen at random → 50% C1 (you get 5), 50% C2 (you get 3) → avg = 4
  - If Player 1 approves neither → C1:1, C2:1 → max = 1 → random → 50% C1 (5), 50% C2 (3) → avg = 4

So your expected payoff depends on Player 1’s behavior.

But you don’t know it.

So to be **safe**, you might assume **Player 1 is rational** and will approve contracts that are beneficial to them.

And **C1 is beneficial to them** (as shown) → so they will **approve C1**.

They may or may not approve C2.

But C2 is neutral for them — same as base game.

They might approve it, or not.

But if you approve **only C1**, you **guarantee** that C1 wins and you get 5.

If you approve both, you risk C2 being selected, and you get only 3.

So **you should not approve C2**.

Because it reduces your expected payoff.

Even though it’s neutral, it **introduces risk** of getting only 3.

But your goal is to **maximize** your expected payoff.

Approving C2 **does not hurt you**, but it **can lower your expected payoff**.

For example, if Player 1 approves only C1, then C1 wins anyway, so C2 approval is wasteful.

If Player 1 approves only C2, then C2 wins → you get 3, which is worse than 5.

So **approving C2 is strictly worse** than not approving it, **in expectation**.

Therefore, you should **not approve C2**.

---

### **Final Decision:**

- **C1**: Approved → because it guarantees you 5 points and is beneficial.
- **C2**: Not approved → because it offers no benefit and risks lowering your payoff.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether you (as Player 1) should approve each of the two proposed contracts.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without contracts)**

The base game is a symmetric 2-player simultaneous move game with actions A0 and A1. Payoffs:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0       | A1       |
|--------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                         | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| **A1**                         | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

This is similar to a **coordination game with a temptation to defect**, but notice the incentives:

- If you play A0, and opponent plays A0 → 5 (good)
- If you play A0, opponent plays A1 → 0 (bad)
- If you play A1, opponent plays A0 → 3 (better than 0, but worse than 5)
- If both play A1 → 3 each (same as when you play A1 vs A0)

So, **A0 is better if the other plays A0**, but **A1 gives a guaranteed 3** whether the other plays A0 or A1.

In fact, **A1 is a dominant strategy for both players**, because:
- If opponent plays A0: you get 5 (A0) > 3 (A1) → you'd prefer A0
- But if opponent plays A1: you get 0 (A0) < 3 (A1) → so A1 is better

Wait — let's recheck:

- If **opponent plays A0**, your best response:
  - A0 → 5
  - A1 → 3 → so **A0 is better**

- If **opponent plays A1**, your best response:
  - A0 → 0
  - A1 → 3 → so **A1 is better**

So there is **no dominant strategy**.

Now look for equilibria.

Check pure strategy Nash equilibria:

1. (A0, A0):  
   - You: 5  
   - If you deviate to A1: get 3, worse → no incentive  
   - Opponent: same  
   → **Nash equilibrium**

2. (A1, A1):  
   - You: 3  
   - Deviate to A0: get 0, worse → no incentive  
   - Opponent: same  
   → **Nash equilibrium**

3. (A0, A1):  
   - You: 0  
   - You can deviate to A1: get 3 → better → not equilibrium

4. (A1, A0):  
   - You: 3  
   - You can deviate to A0: get 5 → better → not equilibrium

So two pure strategy equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Now, which one is better? (A0, A0) gives 5 each → Pareto superior to (A1, A1) giving 3 each.

But in the absence of coordination, players might end up at (A1, A1) if they’re risk-averse or distrustful.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract proposal mechanism**

- Players can **agree** on a **payment contract** via *approval voting*.
- The contract that gets the **most approvals** is selected **uniformly at random** from that set.
- You are Player 1.
- Contracts modify payoffs via **side payments** based on actions.

You decide whether to **approve** each contract.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1)**

> C1:  
> - If a player chooses A0, no additional payments  
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments

→ This is **no change** to the game.

So the payoffs remain exactly as in the base game.

**Your incentives**: unchanged.

- You are not paying or receiving anything regardless of action.

✅ So this contract **does not hurt you**.

In fact, you **approve of it** because it’s harmless and you’re the proposer.

But note: you only get to propose it — you’re still voting on whether to *approve* it.

Because it has no effect, **you can approve it without risk**.

So: **Approve C1 ≡ true**

---

### **Step 4: Analyze Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2)**

> C2:  
> - If a player chooses A0 → they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other player
> - If a player chooses A1 → no additional payments

So:

- If you play A0 → you get +10 points (from the other player)
- If you play A1 → 0 additional payment

But the 10 is “drawn equally from the other players” — since there are two players, “drawn equally from the other player” likely means: each other player pays 5 to you.

So:
- If you play A0 → +10
- If opponent plays A0 → opponent pays you 10 (i.e., you get +10, opponent loses 10)
- If you play A1 → no payment

So net effect on payoffs:

Let’s compute the **total payoff** (base + contract).

**Case 1: You play A0, Opponent plays A0**

- Base: (5, 5)
- Contract: you get +10, opponent loses 10 → total: (5+10, 5−10) = **(15, −5)**

**Case 2: You play A0, Opponent plays A1**

- Base: (0, 3)
- You play A0 → get +10
- Opponent plays A1 → nothing
- So: (0+10, 3) = **(10, 3)**

**Case 3: You play A1, Opponent plays A0**

- Base: (3, 0)
- You play A1 → no payment
- Opponent plays A0 → loses 10 (to you)
- So: (3, 0−10) = **(3, −10)**

**Case 4: You play A1, Opponent plays A1**

- Base: (3, 3)
- No action triggers payment → (3, 3)

So the new payoff matrix becomes:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0           | A1          |
|--------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **A0**                         | (15, −5)     | (10, 3)     |
| **A1**                         | (3, −10)     | (3, 3)      |

Now, analyze whether this changes your incentives.

### Is A0 now a dominant strategy for you?

Check your best responses:

- If opponent plays A0:
  - A0 → 15
  - A1 → 3 → so you prefer A0

- If opponent plays A1:
  - A0 → 10
  - A1 → 3 → so you prefer A0

✅ So **A0 is a dominant strategy** for you under C2.

You will **always play A0**, no matter what the opponent does.

But what about the opponent?

Opponent's payoffs:

- If you play A0 (which you will), and opponent plays A0 → gets −5
- If opponent plays A1 → gets 3 (from base) + 0 (from C2) = 3

So opponent’s best response to you playing A0 is to play A1 (get 3 > −5)

→ So if you play A0, opponent plays A1.

Now check what happens:

You both choose actions:
- You: A0 (dominant)
- Opponent: A1 (best response)

Result: (10, 3) → you get 10, opponent gets 3

But wait — is this stable?

Yes — you play A0 (best), opponent plays A1 (best given you play A0)

So equilibrium outcome: you get **10 points**

What would happen without contract?

In base game:
- Two equilibria: (A0, A0) with 5 each, or (A1, A1) with 3 each.
- If players are rational and symmetric, they might coordinate on (A0, A0), but if not, they might end in (A1, A1)

But with C2, if both play optimally, you get **10**, opponent gets **3**

But is that what happens?

Wait — but **you are the only one deciding whether to approve C2**.

If you **approve** C2, and **Player 2 also approves**, then C2 is enacted.

But if you **don’t approve**, C2 fails.

Now, if C2 passes (i.e., both approve), then **you get 10 points**.

But is that **guaranteed**?

Let’s suppose C2 is enacted:

- You play A0 (dominant strategy)
- Opponent: if they play A0 → get −5
- If they play A1 → get 3
- So opponent plays A1
→ Your payoff: 10

But could Player 2 be irrational?

No — assuming we assume rational players.

Now: would **Player 2 approve C2**?

Player 2’s incentives under C2:

- If they play A0 → get 10 paid to them from you? No.

Wait — the contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So if **Player 2 chooses A0**, player 2 gets +10 from Player 1.

But in the equilibrium under C2, Player 2 will play A1 (since playing A0 gives them −10).

But **would Player 2 want to approve C2**?

Let’s see: if C2 is enacted, and they play optimally, they get **3 points** in the outcome (when you play A0, they play A1).

But if C2 is **not** enacted, what happens?

In the base game, if both are rational, they might end up at (A0, A0) → 5 each, or (A1, A1) → 3 each.

But **Player 2 has no incentive to approve C2** unless it makes their payoff better.

Wait — suppose C2 is **enacted**.

Player 2’s best response is to play A1, so they get only 3.

But **without** C2, if coordination happens on (A0, A0), they get 5.

So 3 < 5 → **Player 2 is worse off under C2**, so **Player 2 would not approve C2**.

But **your goal is to maximize your payoff**, not Player 2's.

But the **contract needs approval from both players** to pass.

The winning contract is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if:
- C1: approved by you → 1 approval
- C2: approved by you → 1 approval, but **Player 2 won’t approve it**, because they get only 3 instead of 5 in the best scenario

So C2 gets only **1 approval** (yours) → same as C1

But in case of tie in number of approvals, the contract is chosen uniformly at random from those with max approvals.

So possibility exists that **C2 is selected**.

But only **if** you approve C2.

So let’s assess:

### **If you approve C2**, and Player 2 does not:
- C2 has 1 approval → same as C1
- So one of C1 or C2 is chosen at random → you get C2 with 50% chance, C1 with 50% chance

Under C1: no contract → base game. What will happen?

In base game, if both players are rational, they might coordinate on (A0, A0) → you get 5
Or end in (A1, A1) → you get 3

But which is more likely?

Since (A0, A0) is Pareto superior, and both players benefit more, it's plausible they coordinate on it.

But without communication, there's no guarantee.

But note: A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy** only if opponent plays A0. But if opponent plays A1, A1 is better.

But **in the absence of coordination**, players might default to risk-dominant or something.

But let’s assume the players are rational and aim for the best outcome.

Alternatively, suppose they both know the game and believe the other is rational.

Then they might expect (A0, A0), since it’s a good equilibrium.

In game theory literature, sometimes (A0, A0) is selected due to payoff dominance.

So **expected payoff under C1**: likely **5**.

But it could be 3 (if they both play A1).

But since (A0, A0) is better and symmetric, let’s assume it's the focal point.

→ So under C1: you get **5**

Under C2: you get **10** (if C2 is enacted)

So if you **approve C2**, then:
- C2 might be chosen (if no other contracts), but since C2 has only your approval (Player 2 won’t approve), and C1 has your approval, both have 1.
- So C2 is selected with 50% chance → expected payoff: 0.5 × 10 + 0.5 × 5 = 5 + 2.5 = **7.5**

Wait — is that correct?

But if C2 is not selected, the game reverts to base game, and you get **5**?

But you have to ask: what if **no contract is selected**?

But the contract is chosen **among those approved**.

So if only C1 is approved, C1 is selected.

If both C1 and C2 are approved (but C2 has only one approval), then both are candidates, and one is randomly selected.

So: if you approve C2 (so both C1 and C2 have one approval each), then one of them is chosen at random.

→ Your expected payoff:  
- 50% chance: C1 → base game → you get ~5  
- 50% chance: C2 → you get 10  
→ Expected: **(0.5)(5) + (0.5)(10) = 2.5 + 5 = 7.5**

But is the base game payoff really 5?

Wait — what if both players are rational and know that (A0, A0) is the best equilibrium, but also (A1, A1) exists?

But **without contract**, and both players want to maximize payoffs, they might both play A0.

But if they don’t coordinate, they might not.

But in **this game**, (A1, A1) is also an equilibrium, and it’s **risk-dominant**?

Check risk dominance.

- Payoff (A0, A0): (5,5)
- Payoff (A1, A1): (3,3)

But if one player plays A0, the other prefers A0 → if you believe opponent plays A0, you play A0
If you believe opponent plays A1, you play A1

But the **"best response" to a mixed strategy**:

Suppose opponent plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)

Your payoff from playing A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p

Your payoff from playing A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So if p > 0.6, you prefer A0
If p < 0.6, you prefer A1

Similarly for opponent.

So the **risk-dominant equilibrium** is (A1, A1) because the threshold is 0.6, meaning you are more likely to play A1 if you’re unsure.

But (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant.

So without coordination, players might end up at (A1, A1) → you get 3.

But if they **believe** the other will play A0, they play A0.

But there’s ambiguity.

But since the question is about **maximizing your total points**, and you can **influence the outcome via contract approval**, we must make assumptions.

But to be conservative, **if no contract is in place**, you cannot guarantee more than 3, but you might get 5 only if coordination happens.

But for simplicity in such games, often the **payoff-dominant equilibrium (A0, A0)** is assumed when players are rational and symmetric.

So let’s assume that without contract, players will coordinate on (A0, A0) → **5 each**.

So under C1: you get 5

Under C2: if enacted, you get 10

So if you approve C2, and C2 is selected (50% chance), you get 10

If C1 is selected (50% chance), you get 5

→ Expected payoff: 7.5

But what if **Player 2 approves C2**?

Then C2 has **2 approvals** → it would win (since C1 has only 1)

Then C2 is selected → you get 10

But is it likely that Player 2 approves C2?

Player 2’s payoff under C2:

- Their payoffs: as computed earlier: (−5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1) → in equilibrium, they play A1 → get 3
- Under base game: if coordination on (A0, A0): they get 5
- So if they believe C2 will cause them to get only 3, they are worse off → **they would not approve**

Thus, Player 2 will **not approve C2**

Therefore, only you approve C2

→ So C2 has 1 approval, C1 has 1 approval → both have max approvals (1)

→ So **one is selected uniformly at random** → each has 50% chance

Therefore, **your expected payoff = 0.5 × 5 + 0.5 × 10 = 7.5**

Now, what if you **do not approve C2**?

Then only C1 is approved → C1 is selected → you get 5

So by **approving C2**, you get **7.5 expected payoff** instead of 5 → you are better off.

But wait: is there a **risk**?

Yes — there is **no guarantee** you get 10; you only get 10 with 50% chance.

But your **expected value increases** from 5 to 7.5.

Therefore, **you should approve C2**?

But is this correct?

Hold on: **the contract is chosen only from those approved**, and it is **selected uniformly at random if tied**.

But C2 has only your approval, C1 has only your approval → both approved by you.

So both are in the running → random selection → 50% chance.

Yes.

But now ask: **Is there any downside to approving C2?**

Suppose C2 is selected.

You get 10 → good.

Is there any chance you get **less** than 5? No — because even in worst case under C2, you get (3 or 10), both ≥3, but in equilibrium you get 10.

Wait — in C2, you get 10 for sure if selected.

In base game (C1), you get 5.

So yes — approval of C2 gives you **a 50% chance to get 10** and **50% to get 5** → expected 7.5

Whereas not approving C2 → 5 for sure

So **you should approve C2**?

But wait — **is this rational?**

What if **Player 2** is also rational, and knows that **if you approve C2**, and they don’t, then C2 has same # approvals as C1 → so it’s chosen at random.

But Player 2 has a **strong disincentive** to **disapprove** C2 — because if they **approve** C2, then C2 has 2 approvals → it wins → they get **3**, which is **worse than 5**.

So they will not approve.

So your approval is **necessary but not sufficient**.

But you can still vote for C2 to get a higher expected payoff.

But is there a **problem**?

Wait — what if **you approve C2**, and **C2 is not passed**? You get 5.

But if you **don’t approve**, you get 5 — same outcome.

But with approval, you have a chance of getting 10.

So the **expected value increases** from 5 to 7.5

So you should approve.

But let’s double-check: **is the expected payoff really 7.5?**

Yes — with 50% chance → C2 → you get 10  
50% chance → C1 → you get 5  
→ 0.5×10 + 0.5×5 = 7.5

Better than 5

But **is it safe?**

You are not risking anything: you are not paying anything, and the contract only helps you in outcome.

Even if C2 is selected, you are guaranteed to get 10, since you play A0 and opponent plays A1.

No risk.

So you get **a free chance at 10**, at no cost.

Therefore, **you should approve C2**.

But wait — **what if** the contract mechanism works differently?

The problem says:

> "The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

So if you approve C2, and C2 is tied with C1 for max approvals, then C2 is selected with positive probability.

So yes.

But now: **should you approve C2?**

Yes — because **expected payoff increases** from 5 to 7.5.

But is there a **risk** if C2 is chosen?

You get 10 — better than 5

Even if the opponent plays A0, you get 15

In all cases under C2, your payoff is at least 3.

In fact, minimum under C2 is 3 (if you play A1 and opponent plays A1), but you won’t — you play A0.

So under C2, you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 10

No risk.

So **you benefit from C2**.

But **Player 2 is hurt**, so they won’t approve.

But that’s fine — you only care about your payoff.

Therefore: **you should approve C2**

But wait — **is the contract really beneficial?**

Let’s consider a **selfish** player perspective.

You are Player 1.

You want to maximize your total points.

By approving C2, you increase your **expected payoff** from 5 to 7.5

So yes.

But is there a **strategic issue**?

What if **other players (in a multi-round game)** could see your actions?

But this is one-shot.

So no learning.

Therefore, **approving C2 gives you higher expected payoff**.

But wait — **let’s calculate C2 payoff again**:

If C2 is selected:
- You play A0 (dominant)
- Opponent plays A1 (because playing A0 gives them −5)
→ You get 10

So yes — you get 10

If C1 is selected:
- You play A0 (if coordination on (A0, A0)) → get 5

So expected: 0.5×10 + 0.5×5 = 7.5

Yes.

But **can you do even better?**

Not with other contracts.

So **approving C2 is beneficial**.

But now consider: **what if C2 is not chosen?** You get 5 anyway.

But with approval, you get **a 50% chance at 10**.

So **you should approve C2**.

But wait — **is there a possibility that C2 being passed leads to worse outcome?**

No — you get 10 if passed

But Player 2 gets 3 — they are worse off.

But that doesn't affect you.

So yes.

---

### **Final Decision: Approve or not?**

- C1: no cost, gives 5 → you approve → true
- C2: gives 7.5 expected → better than 5 → you approve → true

But wait — **is it really true that C2 has only 1 approval?**

- You approve C2
- Player 2: will not approve, because they are worse off

So only you approve C2 — 1 approval

C1: only you approve → 1 approval

So both have 1 approval → both are in contention → random selection

So you get 7.5 expected

But if you **don’t approve C2**, only C1 is approved → you get 5

So **you should approve both?**

But the question is: **approve C1 and C2**

But wait — is C1 really harmless?

Yes — it does nothing.

But now: **is it possible that approving C2 makes the game worse for you?**

No — it only helps in a 50% case.

But here’s a **critical point**:

> The **contract is selected from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

If you approve **both**, then both have 1 approval → still tied → still 50% chance for each.

But your **expected payoff** is still 7.5 — same as if you approve only C2.

But if you approve **both**, you have the same chance.

But **you have no reason not to approve C1** — it’s harmless.

But **you also have reason to approve C2** — it increases your expected payoff.

So you should **approve both**.

But is there a **downside to approving both**?

No.

So:

- Approve C1: true
- Approve C2: true

But wait — what if **C2 being more attractive** causes more people to approve? But only two players.

But **only you control your vote**.

So yes.

But let’s check the contract description again.

C2 says: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, drawn equally from the other players."

So if you play A0, you get +10

But **what if you play A1?** Nothing.

But under C2, you **play A0**, so you get +10.

So yes.

### ✅ Final Answer:

You should approve **both** contracts.

- C1: harmless, gives you 5 if chosen → approve
- C2: if chosen, you get 10; if not, you get 5 → expected 7.5 → better than 5 → approve

So:

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": true}
```

But wait — **one more thing**:

The problem says: "the winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

If you approve **both**, then both have 1 approval → max is 1 → both are selected → random choice → same as before.

So your expected payoff is still 7.5.

If you **don’t approve C2**, you get 5.

So you **do better by approving C2**.

Therefore, **approve both**.

But is C1 really required? No — but you can approve it.

And it doesn't hurt.

So yes.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

The original payoff matrix (from my perspective as Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5, they get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, they get 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, they get 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, they get 3

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)

With the penalty of 3 points for choosing A1:

Modified payoffs:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5) - no change
- (A0, A1): I get 0+3=3 (they pay me), they get 3-3=0
- (A1, A0): I get 3-3=0 (I pay them), they get 0+3=3  
- (A1, A1): I get 3-3+3=3, they get 3-3+3=3

**Key insight**: Under C1, A0 now **weakly dominates** A1:
- When opponent plays A0: A0 gives 5 vs A1 gives 0 (A0 is strictly better)
- When opponent plays A1: A0 gives 3 vs A1 gives 3 (indifferent)

This means rational players should always choose A0, leading to the (A0, A0) outcome with payoff **5 for me**.

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)

C2 is just the original game with no modifications.

The original game has:
- Two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5, and (A1, A1) giving 3
- A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium giving expected payoff of 3

There's **coordination risk** - we might end up at the bad equilibrium or in the mixed strategy.

## Step 4: Compare Contracts

**C1**: Eliminates coordination problems through dominance → guaranteed payoff of **5**

**C2**: Multiple equilibria with coordination risk → expected payoff between **3 and 5**

## Step 5: Voting Strategy

Since C1 guarantees the best outcome (5 points) while C2 involves risk of lower payoffs, I should approve C1.

Should I also approve C2? No, because:
- If I approve only C1, the worst case is a 50/50 chance between C1 and C2
- If I approve both and Player 2 only approves C2, then C2 wins for certain
- Approving only C1 weakly dominates approving both

```json
{"C1": true, "C2": false}
```

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the modified payoffs with the contract

The contract states that choosing A0 gives +10 points from the other player, while choosing A1 has no payment.

**Modified payoff matrix for me (Player 1):**

| My Action | Other's A0 | Other's A1 |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| A0        | 5 + 10 - 10 = **5** | 0 + 10 - 0 = **10** |
| A1        | 3 + 0 - 10 = **-7** | 3 + 0 - 0 = **3** |

Breaking down the calculations:
- **(A0, A0)**: Base 5 + 10 (I chose A0) - 10 (they chose A0) = 5
- **(A0, A1)**: Base 0 + 10 (I chose A0) - 0 (they chose A1) = 10  
- **(A1, A0)**: Base 3 + 0 (I chose A1) - 10 (they chose A0) = -7
- **(A1, A1)**: Base 3 + 0 - 0 = 3

## Step 2: Determine the dominant strategy

Comparing my payoffs:
- If other plays **A0**: I get 5 from A0 vs -7 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If other plays **A1**: I get 10 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **A0 is better**

**A0 strictly dominates A1** - it gives me a higher payoff regardless of what the other player does.

## Step 3: Verify with expected value

If I play A0 with probability p and other plays A0 with probability q:

Expected payoff = 5pq + 10p(1-q) - 7(1-p)q + 3(1-p)(1-q)
                = 5pq + 7p - 10q + 3

The derivative with respect to p is: ∂E/∂p = 5q + 7

Since this is always positive for any q ∈ [0,1], my expected payoff increases with p. Therefore, I should set **p = 1** (always choose A0).

## Conclusion

The optimal strategy is to choose A0 with 100% probability.

{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate the payoffs WITH the contract

Let me adjust the base payoffs with the contract terms:
- When I choose A1, I pay 3 points to the other player
- When the other player chooses A1, they pay 3 points to me
- A0 has no additional payments

**Modified Payoffs (for me):**

1. **(A0, A0)**: 5 + 0 = **5 points**
2. **(A0, A1)**: 0 + 3 (from other's payment) = **3 points**  
3. **(A1, A0)**: 3 - 3 (my payment) = **0 points**
4. **(A1, A1)**: 3 - 3 (my payment) + 3 (other's payment) = **3 points**

## Step 2: Analyze my expected payoffs

If the other player chooses A0 with probability p and A1 with probability (1-p):

- **Expected payoff for A0**: 5p + 3(1-p) = 2p + 3
- **Expected payoff for A1**: 0p + 3(1-p) = 3 - 3p

## Step 3: Determine optimal strategy

Comparing these:
- When p > 0: A0 gives 2p + 3 > 3, while A1 gives 3 - 3p < 3
- A0 is strictly better for any p > 0
- Even when p = 0, both give 3 (indifferent)

**A0 weakly dominates A1.**

## Step 4: Consider the equilibrium

The contract transforms what was originally a prisoner's dilemma-type game into one where:
- A0 is a weakly dominant strategy for both players
- (A0, A0) is the Nash equilibrium
- Both players get 5 points - the maximum possible

Since:
- A0 weakly dominates A1
- The contract (which I proposed!) was designed to incentivize mutual cooperation
- (A0, A0) gives me the highest possible payoff of 5 points

**My optimal strategy is to play A0 with 100% probability.**

Let's break down the decision-making process step by step.

### 1. Understanding Payoff Matrix Without Contract
We first consider the payoff matrix without considering the additional contract layer.

#### Payoff Matrix

|        | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| You A0 | (5, 5)           | (0, 3)           |
| You A1 | (3, 0)           | (3, 3)           |

### 2. Understanding the Impact of the Contract
Now let's incorporate the contract into our decision-making process. Here's the modified payoff matrix considering the contract, which involves adding or subtracting points based on the choices:

- If you choose A1, you pay an additional 2 points, which means the payoff is reduced.
- If both players choose A1, each pays an additional 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

#### Modified Payoff Matrix Considering the Contract

|        | Other Player A0                 | Other Player A1                 |
|--------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| You A0 | You: 5, Player 2: 5             | You: 0, Player 2: 3             |
| You A1 | You: 3 - 2 = 1, Player 2: 0 + 1 = 1  | You: 3 - 2 = 1, Player 2: 3 - 2 + 1 = 2  |

So, the modified payoff matrix considering the contract becomes:

|        | Other Player A0 | Other Player A1 |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| You A0 | (5, 5)           | (0, 1)           |
| You A1 | (1, 1)           | (1, 2)           |

### 3. Strategy Analysis
Looking at the revised payoff matrix, we can see the following:

- If the other player chooses A0, your best response is to choose A0 to earn 5 points instead of 1.
- If the other player chooses A1, your best response is to choose A0 to earn 0 points instead of 1 (both choices result in low points but A0 is marginally better).

Thus, your best strategy is to choose A0 with a high probability since it dominates in all scenarios above.

### 4. Final Strategy
Given the analysis, here's the optimal probability distribution:

- Choose A0 with a high probability.
- Choose A1 with a very low probability or not at all.

Let's finalize this strategy:

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

### Conclusion
Considering the payoff matrix and additional contract clauses, the resulting strategy to maximize your points is:

```json
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, we need to analyze the payoff structure of the original game and compare it with the payoff structure after the contract is applied.

### Original Game Analysis
The payoff matrix for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2) is:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this game, if P1 chooses A0, P2's best response is A0 (5 vs 3). If P1 chooses A1, P2's best response is A1 (3 vs 0). This is a standard coordination game with two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) yielding 5 points each and (A1, A1) yielding 3 points each. There is a risk that if players fail to coordinate (e.g., one plays A0 and the other A1), they might receive lower payoffs (0 or 3).

### Contract Analysis
The contract specifies:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive +4 points, taken from the other player.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no change.

Let's calculate the new payoffs if both players sign:
1.  **(A0, A0):**
    - P1 receives: 5 (base) + 4 (from P2) - 4 (to P2) = 5
    - P2 receives: 5 (base) + 4 (from P1) - 4 (to P1) = 5
2.  **(A0, A1):**
    - P1 receives: 0 (base) + 4 (from P2) = 4
    - P2 receives: 3 (base) - 4 (to P1) = -1
3.  **(A1, A0):**
    - P1 receives: 3 (base) - 4 (to P2) = -1
    - P2 receives: 0 (base) + 4 (from P1) = 4
4.  **(A1, A1):**
    - P1 receives: 3 (base) + 0 = 3
    - P2 receives: 3 (base) + 0 = 3

### Comparison and Decision
The modified payoff matrix for Player 2 is:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 chooses between A0 (5 points) and A1 (-1 point). A0 is better.
- If P1 plays A1: P2 chooses between A0 (4 points) and A1 (3 points). A0 is better.

With the contract signed, **A0 becomes a dominant strategy** for both players. This ensures the game will result in the (A0, A0) outcome, yielding the maximum possible payoff of 5 points. Without the contract, players might get stuck in the less-optimal (A1, A1) equilibrium (3 points) or fail to coordinate (resulting in 0 points for one player). 

Since you are Player 2 and you proposed this contract, and it transforms a coordination game into a game with a single dominant strategy leading to the best possible outcome, signing it is the rational choice to maximize your total points.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without the contract)

The original game is a symmetric two-player game with the following payoffs (Player 1's payoff in each cell):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 5, 5         | 0, 3         |
| **Player 1: A1** | 3, 0         | 3, 3         |

This is a variant of a coordination game with a slight asymmetry.

- If both play A0: mutual 5 → best outcome for both.
- If one plays A0 and the other A1: A1 player gets 3, A0 player gets 0.
- If both play A1: both get 3.

So:
- A0 is best when the other plays A0.
- A1 gives a guaranteed 3, regardless of the other player’s move.

Let’s analyze possible equilibria.

#### Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria:

- **(A0, A0)**: If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 5 by playing A0, 3 by playing A1 → so A0 is best response.
  Likewise, Player 1 prefers A0 if Player 2 plays A0.
  → So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

- **(A1, A1)**: If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 gets 3 from A1, 0 from A0 → so A1 is best response.
  Similarly for Player 1.
  → So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

So there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

But (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant (5,5 > 3,3), so (A0, A0) is more desirable.

However, playing A0 is risky: if the other plays A1, you get 0.

But if both players are rational and coordinate on A0, it’s better.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

Player 2 proposed a contract:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other player(s).
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment.

Note: The contract is **only active if both players sign it**.

So the contract modifies the payoffs **only** if both sign.

Let’s analyze what happens to the payoffs if **both players sign the contract**.

#### Modified payoffs (with contract, both sign):

- Whenever a player chooses A0, they get +4 points **as a bonus**, and the other player loses 4 points (because “drawn equally from the other players” → since there’s only one other player, they lose 4).
- If a player chooses A1: no change.

So we adjust the payoff matrix:

Let’s compute the **new** payoff matrix under the contract (both players sign):

|               | P2: A0         | P2: A1         |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5+4, 5–4 = **9, 1** | 0+4, 3–4 = **4, -1** |
| **P1: A1**    | 3–4, 0+4 = **-1, 4** | 3, 3          |

Let’s double-check:

- (A0, A0): P1 gets 5 (base) + 4 (from contracting A0) = 9; P2 gets 5 – 4 = 1
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 + 4 = 4, P2 gets 3 – 4 = -1
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3 – 4 = -1, P2 gets 0 + 4 = 4
- (A1, A1): both get 3 (no bonus), so (3, 3)

So updated payoffs:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 9, 1   | 4, -1  |
| **P1: A1**    | -1, 4  | 3, 3   |

Now, we analyze this new game.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the modified game (with contract, both sign)

We now look at best responses.

#### Player 1’s best responses:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - P1’s payoff: A0 → 9, A1 → -1 → so **A0 is best**
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - P1’s payoff: A0 → 4, A1 → 3 → so **A0 is best**

So no matter what Player 2 does, **P1’s best response is A0**.

#### Player 2’s best responses:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - P2: A0 → 1, A1 → -1 → so **A0 is best**
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - P2: A0 → 4, A1 → 3 → so **A0 is best**

So Player 2’s best response is **A0**, regardless of what Player 1 does.

Therefore: **(A0, A0)** is the **unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium** of the game **under the contract**.

Moreover, this outcome is robust: both players have a strict incentive to play A0.

And under (A0, A0), Player 1 gets **9 points** (vs. original 5).

Even if the game were stochastic (mixed strategies), this equilibrium is very strong.

But since both players have strictly dominant strategies to play A0, the outcome will be (A0, A0) with probability 1.

---

### Step 4: Should Player 1 sign the contract?

We have two scenarios:

#### Case 1: Player 1 signs the contract

Then:
- If Player 2 also signs → game becomes the modified one → outcome is (A0, A0) → Player 1 gets **9 points**
- If Player 2 does **not** sign → contract is **not active** → game reverts to original → outcome depends on what both players do.

But **the contract only activates if both sign**.

So if Player 1 signs, but Player 2 doesn’t, the contract does nothing.

So Player 1 must ask: **Is it safe to sign?**

We must consider Player 2’s likely action.

But we are told: “the contract was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)”.

This implies that **Player 2 has approved the contract**, meaning they are likely to sign it.

Moreover, in the modified game, **Player 2 also has a dominant strategy to play A0**, and gets 1 point (from A0, A0) — better than any other outcome.

In fact, under the contract, Player 2 also gets 1 point in (A0, A0), which is worse than the original 5, but still: if they play A1, they can get -1 (if both play A0) or 3 (if P1 plays A1), but if P1 is expected to play A0, P2 gets 1 from A0 and -1 from A1 → so A0 is better.

So Player 2 also has incentive to sign — because it guarantees they can play A0 and avoid bad outcomes.

But more importantly: **Player 2 proposed the contract**, so they are willing to sign it.

We assume rational players, and Player 2 has good reason to sign (since under the contract, they can enforce coordination on A0).

Therefore, it is **very likely** that Player 2 will sign.

Thus, if Player 1 signs, the game becomes the modified one → outcome (A0, A0) → Player 1 gets 9 points.

#### Case 2: Player 1 does not sign

Then even if Player 2 signs, the contract does not activate → original game applies.

In the original game:
- (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are both equilibria.
- But no coordination: if both expect A0, both play A0 → P1 gets 5.
- But if one thinks the other might play A1, they might prefer A1 (safe 3).
- So unless there is coordination, outcomes can vary.

But Player 2 proposed a contract that incentivizes A0. They would only propose it if they expect A0 to be played.

But if **Player 1 does not sign**, and Player 2 signs, the contract is inactive → so no incentive for coordination → we’re back to original game.

In the original game:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → Player 2 prefers A0 → so (A0, A0) if they coordinate.
- But if Player 2 thinks Player 1 might play A1, they might prefer A1.

But if both players are rational and know the game, and there's no communication, the risk is high.

However, (A1, A1) is also an equilibrium: both get 3.

But (A0, A0) gives 5, so players might try to coordinate.

But without a contract, coordination is uncertain.

So Player 1 faces uncertainty.

- If Player 1 plays A0: expected payoff depends on Player 2’s belief.
- If Player 1 plays A1: guaranteed 3 (if Player 2 plays A1) or 0 (if Player 2 plays A0) → risky.

But if Player 2 is rational, and Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 will also play A0 → so (A0, A0) likely.

Alternatively, both might play A1.

So in original game, without contract, Player 1 might get 5 (if coordination on A0) or 3 (if coordination on A1) or even 0 (if mismatch).

But the **expected payoff depends on beliefs**.

However, if both players are rational and symmetric, and know this, they might try to coordinate.

But **no commitment**.

Hence, without the contract, there's **risk**.

In contrast: **with the contract**, (A0, A0) is enforced via dominant strategies → **certain 9 points**.

Therefore, **signing the contract leads to a guaranteed 9 points** (assuming Player 2 signs — which is likely, since they proposed it).

**Not signing** exposes Player 1 to potential lower outcomes (3 or 5), depending on coordination.

Even if coordination on A0 happens, it’s only 5 → less than 9.

And if (A1, A1) happens: only 3.

So **signing the contract is strictly better**.

Moreover, since the contract is beneficial to both players (Player 2 also gets 1 in (A0, A0) vs. 0 or 3), Player 2 has an incentive to sign.

Thus, it is rational for Player 1 to sign the contract.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Calculate payoffs WITH the contract

Let me first determine my actual payoffs considering the contract penalty.

**Original payoffs (I'm Player 2):**
- (P1: A0, P2: A0): I get 5
- (P1: A0, P2: A1): I get 3  
- (P1: A1, P2: A0): I get 0
- (P1: A1, P2: A1): I get 3

**Contract effects:**
- If I choose A1: I pay 3 points to Player 1
- If Player 1 chooses A1: They pay 3 points to me

**Adjusted payoffs for me:**
- (P1: A0, P2: A0): 5 + 0 - 0 = **5 points**
- (P1: A0, P2: A1): 3 + 0 - 3 = **0 points**
- (P1: A1, P2: A0): 0 + 3 - 0 = **3 points**
- (P1: A1, P2: A1): 3 + 3 - 3 = **3 points**

## Step 2: Analyze my best responses

Now I compare my options for each possible action by Player 1:

**If Player 1 plays A0:**
- I play A0 → I get 5 points
- I play A1 → I get 0 points
- **A0 is strictly better**

**If Player 1 plays A1:**
- I play A0 → I get 3 points
- I play A1 → I get 3 points
- **Indifferent (tied)**

## Step 3: Determine optimal strategy

Action A0 **weakly dominates** action A1 because:
- A0 gives me a strictly higher payoff when P1 plays A0 (5 > 0)
- A0 gives me an equal payoff when P1 plays A1 (3 = 3)

Therefore, I should never play A1 since A0 is at least as good in all scenarios and strictly better in some.

## Step 4: Consider the strategic context

The contract was designed (proposed by P1) to transform what was originally a Prisoner's Dilemma into a coordination game favoring mutual cooperation (A0, A0). A rational Player 1 should also recognize that A0 is their weakly dominant strategy under this contract, leading to the (A0, A0) outcome with 5 points for each player.

Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without contracts)**

This is a symmetric two-player game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| **P1: A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) |

We are Player 1.

Let’s analyze the best responses and Nash equilibria:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - P1 gets 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A0.
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - P1 gets 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefers A1.

So no pure strategy dominant strategy.

But notice:
- (A0, A0): both get 5 → is a mutual benefit.
- (A1, A1): both get 3 → both worse off than (A0, A0)
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3
- (A1, A0): P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0

The game resembles a **coordination game** with a Pareto-efficient outcome at (A0, A0), but there is a conflict of interest because:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1, you lose big (0).
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0, you get 3 (better than 0, but worse than 5).

So there is an incentive to coordinate on A0, but uncertainty about the other’s move.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the contracts**

There are two proposed contracts:
- **C1 (proposed by Player 1):**
  - If a player chooses A0 → no additional payments.
  - If a player chooses A1 → no additional payments.

→ This is **a null contract**: no payments are added under any action. **No effect.**

- **C2 (proposed by Player 2):**
  - If a player chooses A0 → no additional payments.
  - If a player chooses A1 → no additional payments.

→ Also **a null contract**: identical to C1.

So both contracts are **identical**: they do nothing.

---

### **Step 3: What does "approval voting" mean?**

- Players vote on contracts.
- The **winning contract** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- You want to **maximize your expected points**, so you should approve contracts that:
  - Are beneficial to you,
  - Or at least do not hurt you,
  - And increase the chance of a good outcome.

But here, **both contracts are identical and do nothing**.

So approving or not approving has no direct effect on payoffs — **they are neutral**.

But since they are neutral, should you approve them?

Yes — **because not approving them might reduce their approval count, possibly causing them to be excluded from the "winner pool"**, and since they are *the only contracts*, if **you don’t approve**, then:
- Each contract gets 1 approval (from the proposer, and possibly you).
- If you don't approve, then:
  - C1: 1 approval (Player 1)
  - C2: 1 approval (Player 2)

→ So both still have the same number of approvals → both are tied for max → random selection from both → still possible.

But if you **approve both**, then:
- C1: 2 approvals (P1 and you)
- C2: 2 approvals (P2 and you)

→ Still both are tied → random selection from both → still possible.

But if you **disapprove** one, say C1, then C1: only 1 approval (P1), C2: 2 (P2 + you), so C2 wins with 2 vs 1.

So your **approval affects which contract wins**.

But since both contracts are the same (no effect), **it doesn’t matter** which one wins — the outcome is the same: the game plays out as originally.

So **the contract has no effect on payoffs**, so it doesn’t change anything.

Therefore, your decision only affects **which contract is selected**, but since both are equivalent, **it doesn’t matter**.

But now the question is: **Do you want to approve a contract?**

Since the contract is **neutral** (no cost, no benefit), and **no risk**, why not approve both?

There is no downside to approving a contract that does nothing.

By approving, you increase the chance that the contract gets selected — but since both contracts are identical, **no impact on outcome**.

In fact, **you should approve both** because:
- There is **no cost** to approving.
- You don’t suffer any loss from approving.
- You don’t benefit directly, but you don’t lose either.
- Not approving might cause **a contract to be excluded** from the winner pool — but since both are equivalent, it doesn't matter.

But here’s a key point:

> The **winning contract** is selected at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve **both**, then both have 2 approvals (you + proposer) → both in the pool → one is picked at random → 50% chance each.

If you approve **only one**, then that one has 2 approvals, the other has 1 → only the approved one is in the winner pool → it wins.

If you approve **neither**, then both have 1 approval → both are tied → one is picked at random → 50% chance.

So you have **no influence** over the final outcome **regardless**, because:
- The contract has **no effect** on the actual game.
- The game is unchanged whether a contract is applied or not.
- So the expected payoff is the same no matter which contract wins.

Therefore, **your approval decision does not affect your expected payoff**.

So should you approve?

Yes — **because approving costs you nothing and might help**.

But in this case, since both contracts are identical and do nothing, the **only consequence** is the chance of **favoring one over the other**.

But since they are the same, you are indifferent.

So the rational decision is to **approve both** — why not?

But wait — is there any reason **not** to approve?

Only if approval somehow causes you harm — but there’s no such mechanism.

So: **Approve both.**

---

### **Step 4: Final decision**

- Contract C1 (Player 1): null → neutral → approve
- Contract C2 (Player 2): null → neutral → approve

Even though both are identical, and approval doesn't affect your payoff, you should approve both because:
- It’s risk-free.
- It ensures the contract has maximum approval possible (2).
- You don’t lose anything.
- You're not blocking the adoption of a contract that might have been useful — but in this case, none are.

So **approve both.**

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which contract(s) you, as Player 1, should approve to **maximize your total expected points**, considering the game structure and the potential effects of the contracts.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game Payoffs**

The base game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| You → | A0 (other) | A1 (other) |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **A0**   | 5, 5       | 0, 3       |
| **A1**   | 3, 0       | 3, 3       |

This is similar to a modified coordination game with a slight incentive to deviate.

Let’s analyze the strategic implications:

- If both play A0: you get 5 – best outcome.
- If you play A0 and other plays A1: you get 0 – worst outcome.
- If you play A1 and other plays A0: you get 3 – okay.
- If both play A1: you get 3 – decent.

So, there’s a strong incentive to coordinate on A0, but if the other player plays A1, then playing A1 gives you 3 instead of 0.

But since both players face the same incentives, we can look for Nash equilibria.

#### Finding Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria:

- (A0, A0): Is it stable? If you deviate to A1, your payoff drops from 5 to 3 → no incentive to deviate. So yes, it’s a NE.
- (A1, A1): If you deviate to A0, your payoff goes from 3 to 0 → no incentive to deviate. So also a NE.
- (A0, A1): You get 0. If you switch to A1, you get 3 → so you’d want to deviate → not a NE.
- (A1, A0): You get 3. If you switch to A0, you get 5 → would want to deviate → not a NE.

So two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

But note: (A0, A0) gives higher payoff to both players (5 each), while (A1, A1) gives only 3 each. So (A0, A0) is Pareto superior.

However, without communication or enforcement, players might fail to coordinate on the better equilibrium due to risk of being exploited.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

Now, contracts modify the payoffs through additional payments, based on action choice.

We must assess whether the contract incentivizes behavior that helps *you* (Player 1) maximize your expected total points — taking into account:
- Whether the contract will actually be enforced (i.e., approved by both).
- The approval process: Only contracts with the **maximum number of approvals** win, and that winner is chosen **uniformly at random** — meaning you don’t know which one wins among top-approved ones.
- Your goal: Maximize your **expected points across all possible outcomes**, including under different contracts.

So, your decision to approve a contract matters not just for its own effect, but also how it influences coordination and the final payoff distribution.

---

### **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1 (Yourself)**

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payment in either direction.  
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payment in either direction.

So **no additional payments** at all. This contract effectively does nothing — it leaves the base game unchanged.

Thus, if this contract is approved and enacted, the game plays out as in the original payoff structure.

You **will always approve your own contract**, because you're free to do so, and it costs you nothing. But is it beneficial?

Since you're proposing it, you don't gain anything extra from it. But it doesn't hurt you either.

So: ✅ Approve C1.

---

### **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2**

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Interpretation:
- When you play A0, you gain +1 point (paid by opponent).
- When you play A1, you lose -1 point (your loss is shared with the opponent? Wait — "distributed equally among the other players" — but only one other player.

Since there are only two players, “the other players” means the single opponent.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get +1 from the other player.
- If you play A1 → you pay -1, and thus give 1 point to the other player.

In other words:
- A0 pays you +1
- A1 costs you -1

This is **symmetric** for both players.

So regardless of who plays what, the contract adds:
- +1 to any player who plays A0
- -1 to any player who plays A1

This modifies the base payoffs by adding:
- +1 to whoever plays A0
- -1 to whoever plays A1

#### Let’s recompute the adjusted payoffs under Contract C2:

| You → | A0 (other) | A1 (other) |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **A0**   | 5+1=6, 5+1=6    | 0+1=1, 3–1=2    |
| **A1**   | 3–1=2, 0+1=1    | 3–1=2, 3–1=2    |

Wait — careful: the cost/payments depend on *your* action only.

So:
- If you play A0: you get +1, opponent gets -1
- If you play A1: you get -1, opponent gets +1

So the total payoff for each cell becomes:

- (A0, A0): You: 5 + 1 = **6**, Opponent: 5 + 1 = **6**
- (A0, A1): You: 0 + 1 = **1**, Opponent: 3 – 1 = **2**
- (A1, A0): You: 3 – 1 = **2**, Opponent: 0 + 1 = **1**
- (A1, A1): You: 3 – 1 = **2**, Opponent: 3 – 1 = **2**

So now the adjusted payoff matrix (for **you**, Player 1) is:

| Your Action → | A0 (opp) | A1 (opp) |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**         | 6        | 1        |
| **A1**         | 2        | 2        |

Now, let’s find the optimal strategy for **you** under C2.

If you play A0:
- Expected payoff depends on opponent’s move.
- If opp plays A0: you get 6
- If opp plays A1: you get 1

If you play A1:
- No matter what opp does, you get 2

So clearly, **A0** gives better outcomes depending on opponent.

But to find optimal mixed strategy, compute best response.

Suppose opponent plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p)

Your expected payoff:
- A0: 6p + 1(1-p) = 5p + 1
- A1: 2p + 2(1-p) = 2

Set A0 = A1: 5p + 1 = 2 → 5p = 1 → p = 0.2

So:
- If opponent plays A0 with p < 0.2, you prefer A1
- If p > 0.2, you prefer A0
- At p = 0.2, indifferent

But **this is only your view**. The key is: does this contract help **you**?

Let’s consider **what happens when C2 is implemented**.

But remember: Player 2 proposed this contract. So their interests may differ.

From **Player 2’s perspective**, playing A0 gives them +1 (they gain from you), A1 gives them -1 (they pay something).

So Player 2 has strong incentive to choose A0.

Similarly, you (Player 1) now have strong incentive to choose A0 too — because A0 gives you 6 vs. 2.

So **both players have incentive to choose A0**.

Is (A0, A0) a Nash equilibrium under C2?

Check:
- If you play A0, opponent gets 6 if they play A0, but only 2 if they play A1 → so they prefer A0
- If you play A1, opponent gets only 1 if they play A0, versus 2 if they play A1 → wait! That’s interesting.

Wait — let’s double-check:

Player 2’s payoff under C2:

| You → | A0 (opp) | A1 (opp) |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **A0** | 6 → opp: 6 → 5+1 = 6? Wait!

No — earlier I misapplied symmetry.

Let me clarify:

- When **a player chooses A0**, they receive +1 **from the opponent**.
- When **a player chooses A1**, they **pay 1 to the opponent**.

So the payments go from one player to the other, **based on one’s own action**.

So:
- If you play A0, you gain +1; opponent loses -1
- If you play A1, you lose -1; opponent gains +1

So in every case, it's symmetric — but directional.

For example:
- (A0, A0): You receive +1 → your total: 5 + 1 = 6; opponent gets +1 → total 5 + 1 = 6
- (A0, A1): You played A0 → get +1 → 0 + 1 = 1; opponent played A1 → pays -1 → their payoff: 3 - 1 = 2
- (A1, A0): You played A1 → pay -1 → 3 - 1 = 2; opponent played A0 → gets +1 → 0 + 1 = 1
- (A1, A1): You pay -1 → 3 - 1 = 2; opponent pays -1 → 3 - 1 = 2

So yes, same as before.

Now, let’s look at **Player 2’s incentives** under C2:

Player 2 (opponent)’s payoff:

| You → | A0 | A1 |
|------|----|----|
| **A0** | 6 | 2 |
| **A1** | 1 | 2 |

So Player 2:
- If you play A0, they prefer to play A0 (6 vs. 1)
- If you play A1, they are indifferent between A0 (2) and A1 (2)

So Player 2 has **no strong incentive to play A0 unless you play A0**.

But if you play A1, they’re indifferent.

Now, from **your perspective (Player 1)**:
You get:
- A0: 6 if opp A0, 1 if opp A1
- A1: 2 regardless

So you strictly prefer A0 whenever opponent plays A0 with probability > 0.2

But if opponent plays A1 often, you might still prefer A0 — because A0 gets you 1, A1 gets you 2, so A1 is better than A0 when opp plays A1.

Wait — hold on.

Compare:
- If you play A0 and opp plays A1 → you get 1
- If you play A1 and opp plays A1 → you get 2 → better

So if opp plays A1 with high frequency, A1 dominates A0 for you.

So your best response depends on opp's mix.

Let’s compute the Nash equilibrium under C2.

Let p = probability you (Player 1) play A0  
q = probability opponent (Player 2) plays A0

Your expected payoff:
- A0: q*(6) + (1-q)*(1) = 6q + 1 - q = 5q + 1
- A1: q*(2) + (1-q)*(2) = 2

So you play A0 if 5q + 1 > 2 → 5q > 1 → q > 0.2  
Indifferent if q = 0.2  
Play A1 if q < 0.2

Now for Player 2:

Their payoff:
- A0: p*(6) + (1-p)*(2) = 6p + 2 - 2p = 4p + 2
- A1: p*(1) + (1-p)*(2) = p + 2 - 2p = 2 - p

Set equal: 4p + 2 = 2 - p → 5p = 0 → p = 0

So Player 2’s best response:
- Play A0 if 4p + 2 > 2 - p → 5p > 0 → p > 0
- Play A1 if p < 0
- Indifferent only at p = 0

So for any p > 0, Player 2 prefers A0
Only at p = 0, they’re indifferent.

But p = 0 means you always play A1 → then Player 2’s payoff from A0: 4(0)+2 = 2, from A1: 2 - 0 = 2 → indifferent

So **in equilibrium**, since p > 0 implies Player 2 plays A0, and if p = 0, they’re indifferent (but would want to play A0 if they think you might play A0 even slightly).

But the only way to have consistent equilibrium is if both players play A0 with some probability such that each is indifferent or best responding.

But from above:
- You play A0 only if q > 0.2
- Player 2 plays A0 only if p > 0

So suppose p > 0 → Player 2 plays A0 → q = p > 0 → you will play A0 if q > 0.2 → so need p > 0.2

But if p > 0.2, then q = p > 0.2 → you're willing to play A0 → consistent

So there can be a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium where q > 0.2 and p > 0.2

But let’s solve for the mixed equilibrium.

Assume:
- You play A0 with prob p
- Opponent plays A0 with prob q

At equilibrium:
- You are indifferent between A0 and A1: 5q + 1 = 2 → q = 0.2
- Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1: 4p + 2 = 2 - p → 5p = 0 → p = 0

Contradiction: q = 0.2 requires p > 0 for Player 2 to play A0, but p = 0 requires Player 2 to be indifferent — but at p=0, Q=q=0.2 → not possible.

Wait — inconsistency here.

Player 2’s indifference condition: 4p + 2 = 2 - p → 5p = 0 → p = 0

But if p = 0, you always play A1

Then Player 2 gets:
- A0: 4(0)+2 = 2
- A1: 2 - 0 = 2 → indifferent

So Player 2 can play any mixed strategy; let's say they play A0 with q

Now your best response:
- You compare: A0 payoff: 5q + 1, A1 payoff: 2
- You prefer A0 iff 5q + 1 > 2 → q > 0.2
- But if p = 0, you are supposed to never play A0 → so you must have A0 payoff ≤ A1 payoff → 5q + 1 ≤ 2 → q ≤ 0.2

So q ≤ 0.2

But for Player 2 to be indifferent, p = 0 — which is allowed only if q ≤ 0.2

So in mixed strategy equilibrium:
- p = 0 (you play A1 always)
- q = ? such that you are indifferent → 5q + 1 = 2 → q = 0.2
- Then Player 2 is indifferent at q=0.2, so they can play A0 with 0.2

Is this stable?
- You play A1 (p=0)
- Opponent plays A0 with q=0.2 → so with prob 0.8, they play A1
- Your expected payoff from A0: 5*(0.2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
- From A1: 2 → so you are indifferent → can play A1
- Opponent: if you play A1 (q=0 → no, p=0) — wait, p=0 means you always play A1

Opponent’s payoff from A0: 4p + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2
From A1: 2 - p = 2 → so indifferent → can play any mix → including q=0.2

So this **is a Nash equilibrium**: (p=0, q=0.2)

What about other equilibria?

Suppose both play A0: (p=1, q=1)
- You get 6 from A0, 2 from A1 → so A0 better → you won’t deviate
- Opponent: if you play A0, they get 6 from A0, 2 from A1 → A0 better → won’t deviate
→ So (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium!

Even though our mixed strategy calculation suggested otherwise, (A0, A0) is stable.

So multiple NE exist under C2.

Now, which one is more likely? We don’t know.

But notice: under C2, you get **higher payoff if both play A0** (6 vs 2 in A1,A1). And both players have incentive to play A0 — especially Player 2.

So perhaps C2 **induces coordination on A0**.

But remember: under C2, payoff for (A0, A0) is 6 for both — very good.

Whereas under base game, it was 5 each.

So C2 makes A0 even more attractive.

Moreover, if both players believe the other will play A0, they are happy to do so.

Also, A1 is punished: if someone plays A1, they pay -1, which lowers their payoff.

So overall, C2 **shifts incentives strongly toward A0**.

And since (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium under C2 (and even stronger than base game), and gives you 6 — better than base's 5 — it seems beneficial.

But **there’s a catch**:

This contract was proposed by **Player 2**.

Would Player 2 approve it?

Well, under C2, Player 2:
- Gets +1 for playing A0
- Gets -1 for playing A1

Same as you.

So both players are affected identically.

So if Player 2 believes playing A0 is better, they will vote for C2.

Moreover, C2 benefits them too.

So likely, Player 2 approves C2.

You (Player 1) also benefit from C2: because you are rewarded for A0, penalized for A1 — aligning incentives.

Also, in many cases (e.g., both play A0), you get 6 — better than 5.

Even in worse-case (A0, A1), you get 1 — worse than 0, but maybe offset by increased likelihood of cooperation?

Wait — but in base game, (A0, A1) gave you 0, now it gives you 1 — better.

(A1, A0): base gave you 3, now gives you 2 — worse.

(A1, A1): base gave 3, now gives 2 — worse.

But only if the other player plays A0 and you play A1, you’re worse off.

But if C2 increases the chance of mutual A0, it might be net positive.

But crucially: **C2 could increase coordination on A0**, avoiding the bad outcomes.

In fact, without contract, there are two equilibria: (A0,A0) gives 5, (A1,A1) gives 3.

With C2:
- (A0,A0) gives 6
- (A1,A1) gives 2

So (A0,A0) is now even better relative to (A1,A1).

Also, deviations are punished — e.g., if you play A1, you pay -1.

So **C2 encourages cooperation on A0**.

Hence, **C2 benefits Player 1**.

Even though Player 2 proposed it, it’s symmetric — so it’s fair.

Therefore, you should support it.

But wait — does supporting it affect your strategy?

Not directly: the contract is voted on, and if it passes, it alters payoffs.

Since you stand to gain from it (more incentives to play A0, higher payoff when both play A0), and since it doesn’t hurt you, you should **approve C2**.

But let’s now compare to C1.

C1 does nothing — so payoffs are original.

C2 improves expected outcome for you, especially if coordination occurs.

So why would you reject C2?

Unless… you distrust Player 2? But there’s no reason.

Also, approval voting: you want contracts that pass.

C2 is symmetric and beneficial to both.

C1 is neutral.

So C2 is **better** than C1.

But the winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with maximum approvals.

So if both C1 and C2 are approved by both players, then both are in the running, and one wins at random.

But if you **reject C2**, then only C1 can win.

But C1 gives you lower expected payoff than C2.

Therefore, **your interest lies in having C2 approved**, so that potentially it wins.

Even if it doesn’t win, if it’s approved and wins among high-approved ones, you get better payoffs.

So **you should approve C2**.

Now, what about **approval of C1**?

C1 does nothing. But it costs you nothing to approve it — and it might help you if C2 fails.

But if C2 is approved and wins, you get better payoffs.

But if C2 fails (not enough approvals), then C1 might be the only one (or tied for most approvals), and you want it to win.

But **approving C1 doesn't hurt you**, and it’s risk-free.

So to increase chances of *some contract* winning, you should approve C1 as well.

But is it necessary?

Suppose we approve only C2 — then C2 has 1 approval (yours), and C1 has 0.

So C2 wins (only one with max approvals: 1).

So C2 is enacted.

If you reject C2 and approve C1: C1 wins.

But C1 is less favorable.

So **best outcome** is if C2 is approved and wins.

But to achieve that, you must **approve C2**.

Can you make C2 win by approving it alone?

Yes — if only you approve C2, and Player 2 approves it too, then C2 has 2 approvals, C1 has 1 — so C2 wins.

But if Player 2 does not approve C2, it might have only 1 approval.

But since C2 is symmetric and beneficial, it’s likely Player 2 **will approve it**.

But you don’t know.

However, **you cannot control Player 2’s vote**, but you can set yours.

To maximize your chances of getting a good contract (like C2), you should **approving C2**.

Similarly, if C1 is the fallback, you shouldn’t block it.

But approving C1 **doesn’t reduce** your benefit from C2.

It only helps in cases where C2 fails to win.

But since C2 is better for you, you want it to win.

So:

- Approve C1: risk-free, no downside
- Approve C2: allows you to get better payoffs if it’s adopted

So you should approve both.

But is there a reason not to approve C1?

No.

C1 is harmless.

Approving C1 gives you no downside — it only gives you more options.

But if C2 is approved and wins, you don’t care about C1.

But by approving C1, you increase the chance that at least one contract wins.

But if you don’t approve C1, and C2 has only 1 approval (you alone), and C1 has 0, then C2 wins anyway.

So only if C2 is rejected by Player 2, then C1 becomes the only viable one.

So approving C1 doesn’t hurt — and might help if C2 fails.

Thus, **approve both**.

But let’s check: is there any danger in approving C2?

Only if it hurts *you*. But we analyzed: it improves your incentives toward A0, and (A0,A0) gives you 6 instead of 5.

Even in worst case, you get at least 1 (vs 0), which is better.

So no downside.

Thus, **you should approve both contracts**.

Wait — but the problem says:

> The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve C1 and C2, and Player 2 only approves C2, then:
- C2: 2 approvals (you + P2)
- C1: 1 approval (only you)
Then C2 is the only one with 2 approvals → wins

Perfect.

If Player 2 approves only C1, then C1: 2 approvals, C2: 1 → C1 wins.

But in that case, you lose — but you had no choice.

But from your perspective, C2 is better.

But you can’t control Player 2.

But if you **do not approve C2**, then C2 has at most 1 approval (Player 2 alone), so if C1 is approved by both, C1 wins.

But C1 gives you worse payoff.

So if you **reject C2**, you ensure that C2 cannot win — even if Player 2 approves it.

But that’s bad for you.

So to maximize your expected payoff, you **must approve C2**.

And approve C1 for safety.

So final answer:

✅ Approve C1 (harmless, safe)
✅ Approve C2 (improves your payoff)

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

agent: openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13(CoT)#P2
response:
To determine whether to sign the contract, let's analyze the original payoffs and the potential impact of the contract.

### Step 1: Analyze the Original Payoff Matrix
The payoffs for each possible combination of actions are:
- If both choose A0: (5, 5)
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: (0, 3)
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: (3, 0)
- If both choose A1: (3, 3)

Here, the best mutual outcome (in terms of total points) occurs when both choose A0, yielding 10 points shared equally.

### Step 2: Analyze the Impact of the Contract
The proposed contract introduces additional payments:
- Choosing A0 gives an extra 1 point (total 6, divided equally, so each gets +0.5).
- Choosing A1 costs 1 point (total 4, divided equally, so each loses -0.5).

Revised payoffs under the contract:
- If both choose A0: (5.5, 5.5) i.e., 5 + 0.5, 5 + 0.5
- If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1: (-0.5, 2.5) i.e., 0 + 0.5 and 3 - 0.5
- If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0: (2.5, -0.5) i.e., 3 - 0.5 and 0 + 0.5
- If both choose A1: (2.5, 2.5) i.e., 3 - 0.5, 3 - 0.5

### Step 3: Evaluate the Expected Outcomes
Let’s consider the rationale:
- With the contract, both choosing A0 results in higher mutual benefits (5.5 each) than before (5 each).
- If one chooses A0 and the other chooses A1, before the contract, Player 2 preferred A1 (as 3 > 0). 
  However, with the contract, it becomes disadvantageous since they would earn only 2.5 points, and Player 1 fared even worse (-0.5).
- If both choose A1, the outcome is slightly worse than without the contract (2.5 each vs. 3 each).

### Step 4: Decision
Given the revised payoffs, the contract makes mutual cooperation (both choosing A0) more attractive and penalizes deviation. This increases the incentive to act collaboratively without significant deviations.

Thus, I should sign the contract to bolster mutual cooperation, raising both personal and combined gains. The payoffs suggest harmonious strategy alignment resulting in optimized total points.

{"sign": true}

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (without contracts)**

This is a game with two players (you are **Player 2**), each choosing between actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0       | A1       |
|------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                            | 5, 5     | 0, 3     |
| **A1**                            | 3, 0     | 3, 3     |

We can analyze the **Nash equilibria** of this game to understand likely behavior.

#### Best responses:

- If Player 1 plays A0:
  - You (Player 2) get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefer **A0**
- If Player 1 plays A1:
  - You get 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefer **A1**

So your best response depends on what Player 1 does.

Now from Player 1’s perspective:
- If you (Player 2) play A0: Player 1 gets 5 (if plays A0), 0 (if plays A1) → prefers **A0**
- If you play A1: Player 1 gets 3 (if plays A0), 3 (if plays A1) → indifferent, but both give same payoff

So Nash equilibria:

1. (A0, A0): Both get 5 → mutual best response
2. (A1, A1): Both get 3 → mutual best response
3. Mixed strategy equilibria?

Let’s check if there’s a mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let P be the probability Player 1 plays A0.
You (Player 2) will be indifferent if:
- Expected payoff from A0: 5P + 0(1-P) = 5P
- Expected payoff from A1: 3P + 3(1-P) = 3

Set equal: 5P = 3 → P = 3/5

So if Player 1 plays A0 with 3/5, you are indifferent.

Similarly, for Player 1 to be indifferent:
Let Q be your (Player 2) probability of playing A0.
Player 1’s payoff:
- A0: 5Q + 0(1-Q) = 5Q
- A1: 3Q + 3(1-Q) = 3

Set 5Q = 3 → Q = 3/5

So (3/5, 3/5) is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

But in all cases, **(A0, A0)** gives the best outcome for both players (5 each), but **(A1, A1)** gives 3 each, which is worse.

So there's a **coordination problem** — both can get 5, but only if both play A0.

But from symmetry, if both are rational and know this, they might end up at (A0, A0). However, the game is **not symmetric in incentives** because:

- If you deviate from A0 to A1 when the other plays A0, you go from 5 to 3 → loss
- But if you play A0 when the other plays A1, you get 0 → very bad

So **A0 is risky** unless you're sure the other player will play A0.

But in (A1, A1), both get 3 — a safer, stable equilibrium if players are cautious.

But 5 > 3, so (A0, A0) is **Pareto superior**.

So the challenge is: how to **coordinate on (A0, A0)**?

---

### **Step 2: Contract Mechanism**

Now, a **contract** can be added **if both players approve it via approval voting**, and the **winning contract** is selected *uniformly at random* from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

Note: The winning contract is chosen **only** from contracts that get the **most approvals**, and if multiple such contracts are tied for max approvals, one is picked uniformly at random.

You are **Player 2**, and you must decide **which contracts to approve** to **maximize your expected payoff**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Proposed Contracts**

#### **Contract C1 (proposed by Player 1):**
- If a player chooses A0 → no additional payment in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1 → no additional payment in either direction.

→ This is **a null contract**: no payments for any action.

So the game remains exactly as is.

#### **Contract C2 (proposed by Player 2):**
- If a player chooses A0 → no additional payment in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1 → no additional payment in either direction.

→ **Same as C1.**

So both contracts are **identical**: **no changes to the game**, no side payments.

---

### **Step 4: Should You Approve These Contracts?**

Both contracts are **identical and neutral**. They don’t change any payoffs.

Now, consider the **objective**: **Maximize your total points**.

But you don’t control the contract outcome — it’s selected **uniformly at random from contracts with the maximum number of approvals**.

So your strategy is to **maximize your expected payoff**, given that:

- You can approve (or not) each contract.
- The winning contract is chosen at random from those with **maximum approvals**.
- If both contracts are approved by you, then:
  - C1: approved by you + Player 1 → 2 approvals
  - C2: approved by you + Player 2 → 2 approvals
  → So both have maximum approvals → one is picked uniformly at random → you get **50% chance of C1, 50% chance of C2**
  → But both are the same → so outcome is the same as base game.

But — here's the key:

- **Contract C1 is proposed by Player 1.**
- **Contract C2 is proposed by Player 2.**
- But they are **identical**.

So, from a **game-theoretic perspective**, there is **no difference** between them.

### But wait: Is there any **strategic difference** in your approval?

Suppose:

- You **approve both**: then both C1 and C2 get 2 approvals (assuming Player 1 approves C1, Player 2 approves C2).
  - Max approvals = 2 → both C1 and C2 are candidates → randomly selected → you get equal chance → final game is unchanged → **your expected payoff = expected payoff of base game under equilibrium**
- You **approve neither**: then both contracts have 1 approval (Player 1 + Player 2) → max approvals = 1 → both are tied → one is randomly selected → again same game → same outcome.
- You **approve only one** (say C1), and not C2:
  - C1: 2 approvals (you + P1)
  - C2: 1 approval (only P2)
  - Max approvals = 2 → C1 wins → you get C1 → but it's same as base game

So **no matter what**, if the contract is implemented (as either C1 or C2), it’s **identical** to the original game.

So **the payoff is unchanged** in all cases.

Therefore, your **expected payoff is the same** regardless of your approval choices.

But **you must choose** whether to approve each contract.

Now, since you are **Player 2**, and you are **only playing the game once**, and contracts are chosen randomly from those with maximum approvals, **you can only affect the outcome by influencing which contract gets chosen**.

But since **both contracts are identical**, you cannot improve outcomes by approving one over the other.

### However, consider this: **the contract is only effective if it changes behavior**.

But since both contracts are **completely neutral**, they do **not change** the incentives in the game.

So **no matter what contract is selected**, the original game remains unchanged.

Therefore, **you should approve both**, to maximize the chance that **a contract is implemented**.

But hold on — is **any contract** implemented?

The rule says: *"The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."*

So, **if no contract gets any approvals**, then there is no winning contract?

But the rule doesn’t specify what happens if no contract is approved.

But in this case, **Player 1 approves C1**, and **Player 2 approves C2** — **each proposed contract is approved by its proposer**.

So even if you (Player 2) don’t approve C1, **C1 has at least 1 approval** (Player 1).

Similarly, **C2 has at least 1 approval** (Player 2).

So **minimum approvals** per contract: 1.

Now, **you** are deciding whether to approve C1 and C2.

Suppose you **approve both**:
- C1: 2 approvals (P1 and you)
- C2: 2 approvals (P2 and you)
→ Max = 2 → both win with equal chance
→ Result: game remains unchanged

Suppose you **approve only C1**, not C2:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 1 approval
→ Max = 2 → C1 wins → game unchanged

Suppose you **approve only C2**, not C1:
- C1: 1
- C2: 2
→ Max = 2 → C2 wins → game unchanged

Suppose you **approve neither**:
- C1: 1 (P1 only)
- C2: 1 (P2 only)
→ Max = 1 → both have max approvals → one picked at random → game unchanged

So **no matter what**, the **contract is always applied**, and since it’s neutral, **the game is unchanged**.

Therefore, **you cannot change the outcome** by approval.

But — is there a possibility of **coordination failure**? Only if **no contract is approved**, but in this case, **each contract is approved by its proposer**, so **at least 1 approval per contract**.

So **the contract will always be selected**.

Thus, **your approval choices have no effect** on the final game.

Hence, the **expected payoff is identical** regardless of your decisions.

But you still have to **answer whether to approve or not**.

Now, since **both contracts are identical and neutral**, and **you cannot change the outcome**, but you are trying to **maximize your expected points**, and the payoff is **independent of your approval**, you should **approve both**, because:

- It does not hurt you.
- It might be **socially desirable** or **consistent** to support both contracts (since they are your own and the other’s).
- You might be seen as cooperative.
- There is **no downside**.

But — here’s a deeper point:

Suppose you **disapprove** C1. Then C1 only has 1 approval (P1). C2 has 2 (you and P2). Then C2 wins.

But C2 is the same as C1 → same outcome.

Similarly, if you **disapprove C2**, then C1 wins (if you approve it) or only has 1 approval.

So **no difference**.

But — could there be a **strategic reason to disapprove**?

Only if **some contract were better or worse for you**, but **both are identical and neutral**.

So **you gain nothing from disapproving either**.

Therefore, the **best strategy is to approve both**, because:

- It keeps the process open.
- It avoids the risk that a contract might not be selected (but that risk is already zero).
- And it doesn’t hurt.
- Since you are **Player 2**, and C2 is **your own proposal**, you are likely to **favor it** (in fact, it’s required to approve it to even participate).

But — the question is: **Do you approve C1 and C2?**

Now, since the **payoff is the same in all cases**, and **you have no incentive to disapprove**, and **approval costs nothing**, **you should approve both**.

But — wait: what if **not approving a contract reduces the chance of a contract being selected**? But in this case, **it's impossible** for a contract to be rejected with zero approvals, because each is approved by its proposer.

So **every contract has at least one approval**, so **a contract will always be selected**.

Hence, **you can safely approve both**, or only one, or none — **the outcome is the same**.

But since you **must** choose, and **no cost to approving**, and **potentially a benefit of being cooperative or consistent**, the **optimal action is to approve both**.

---

### **Final Answer**

Despite both contracts being identical and having no effect, you should **approve both** to maximize the chance that the contract system functions as intended, and because there is **no downside**.

You are Player 2, and Contract C2 is proposed by you. You are likely to approve your own proposal.

Also, approving C1 (Player 1's) doesn’t hurt you, and may reflect goodwill.

So, **approve both**.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Understanding the game without the contract

The payoff matrix without the contract:
- (A0, A0): I get 5, opponent gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, opponent gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, opponent gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, opponent gets 3

This game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria:
1. **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5 points ✓ (better outcome)
2. **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3 points (worse outcome)

There's also a mixed strategy equilibrium where both players play A0 with probability 3/5, yielding expected payoff of 3 points.

### Step 2: Understanding the contract's effect

The contract specifies: If a player chooses A1, they pay 3 points to the other player.

Modified payoffs WITH the contract:
- (A0, A0): 5 for me, 5 for opponent (no payments)
- (A0, A1): 0 + 3 = **3** for me, 3 - 3 = **0** for opponent
- (A1, A0): 3 - 3 = **0** for me, 0 + 3 = **3** for opponent
- (A1, A1): 3 - 3 + 3 = **3** for me, 3 - 3 + 3 = **3** for opponent

### Step 3: Finding the equilibrium with the contract

With the contract:
- If opponent plays A0: I get 5 from A0 vs 0 from A1 → **A0 is better**
- If opponent plays A1: I get 3 from A0 vs 3 from A1 → **Indifferent**

Therefore, **A0 weakly dominates A1** with the contract.

By symmetry, the opponent also has A0 as a weakly dominant strategy.

### Step 4: Comparing outcomes

**Without contract:**
- Risk of (A1, A1) equilibrium: 3 points
- Mixed strategy equilibrium: 3 points expected
- Best case (A0, A0): 5 points (but uncertain coordination)

**With contract:**
- Unique dominant strategy equilibrium: (A0, A0)
- Guaranteed: **5 points**

### Conclusion

The contract eliminates the coordination problem by making A0 the weakly dominant strategy for both players. This ensures we reach the efficient (A0, A0) outcome with 5 points instead of risking the inferior equilibria that yield only 3 points.

**I should sign the contract.**

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contracts)**

The base game is a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0         | A1         |
|-----------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                      | 5, 5       | 0, 3       |
| **A1**                      | 3, 0       | 3, 3       |

This is not a standard prisoner’s dilemma, but it has some similar features.

Let’s analyze the best responses:

- If the other plays A0:
  - You get 5 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefer A0
- If the other plays A1:
  - You get 0 for A0, 3 for A1 → prefer A1

So, your best response depends on what the other player does.

Likewise, from the other player's perspective, same structure.

This game has **two pure strategy Nash equilibria**:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

And one mixed strategy equilibrium.

But note: (A0, A0) is payoff-dominant (both get 5), while (A1, A1) is risk-dominant? Actually, let's check.

In (A0, A0), if you deviate to A1 while the other plays A0, you go from 5 to 3 → worse.
In (A1, A1), if you deviate to A0 while other plays A1, you go from 3 to 0 → worse.

So both are Nash equilibria.

But (A0, A0) is better for both.

However, because of the asymmetry in payoffs when mismatched (you get 0 if you play A0 while other plays A1), players may be wary of playing A0 unless they trust the other.

So the challenge is coordination: both want to play A0, but risk getting 0 if they play A0 and other plays A1.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

Now, contracts modify the payoff **in addition to** the base game.

The contracts define **extra payments** based on your action, paid or received from the other player.

We are to decide which contracts to approve.

We are Player 1. We want to **maximize our expected total points**, so we should approve contracts that increase our expected payoff, or at least not hurt us, especially if they help coordinate better outcomes.

But recall: the **winning contract is selected uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So we must **strategically approve contracts** not just based on personal benefit, but also to **increase the chance** that a favorable contract wins.

But here's the twist: **contract terms are designed to incentivize behavior**, and they are **binding only if both approve**? Wait — no.

Wait: **"a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process"**.

So a contract passes only if **both players approve** it.

But the voting is **approval voting** — each player can approve some or all contracts, and the contract that gets **the most approvals** wins.

But since there are only two players, the **maximum number of approvals for a contract** is 2.

So a contract can only be selected if **both players approve it**.

Because if only one approves it, it gets 1 approval, while others might get 1 or 2.

So the only contracts that can ever win are those approved by **both players**.

Therefore, **to have a chance of a contract being selected, we must approve a contract that the other player also approves**.

But we don't know what the other player will approve — yet we have to decide.

But we are trying to **maximize our expected points**, so we must **choose a set of contracts to approve**, knowing that:

- Only contracts approved by both players become active.
- The winning contract is chosen uniformly at random among **all contracts that are approved by both players**.

Therefore, if we approve a contract, it only has a chance to win if **Player 2 also approves it**.

So we must ask: **which contracts can be made to pass (i.e., be approved by both)**?

And **which of those would be best for us?**

But we are strategic — we can only control our own approvals.

So let's analyze the contracts.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Two Proposed Contracts**

#### **Contract C1: Proposed by Player 1 (Selfish)**
- If you choose A0 → no additional payment
- If you choose A1 → no additional payment

So this contract **does nothing** — it's a null contract. It adds **no extra payments**.

So it's equivalent to the base game.

So this contract **does not change** the payoffs in any way.

But — since it's proposed by us, and we are Player 1, we may want to approve it if we think it might lead to coordination or be used as a fallback.

But it does nothing.

#### **Contract C2: Proposed by Player 2**
- If a player chooses A0 → they get +2, taken from the other player
- If a player chooses A1 → they pay -2 (i.e., pay 2 to the other player)

So this contract modifies the base payoffs:

Let’s compute the **total payoff** (base + contract) when you play each action, depending on what the other player does.

Let’s compute for **Player 1** (us):

We assume that the **contract is applied in addition to** the base game payoffs.

So total points = base payoff + contract adjustment.

We’ll compute for each combination:

---

**Case 1: You play A0, other plays A0**

- Base: you get 5, other gets 5
- Contract: you get +2 (because you chose A0), other gets +2
- So total: you get 5 + 2 = **7**, other gets 5 + 2 = 7

**Case 2: You play A0, other plays A1**

- Base: you get 0, other gets 3
- Contract: you get +2 (A0), other pays -2 (A1) → so other loses 2
- So total: you get 0 + 2 = **2**, other gets 3 - 2 = **1**

**Case 3: You play A1, other plays A0**

- Base: you get 3, other gets 0
- Contract: you pay -2 (A1), other gets +2 (A0)
- So total: you get 3 - 2 = **1**, other gets 0 + 2 = **2**

**Case 4: You play A1, other plays A1**

- Base: both get 3
- Contract: both pay -2 (A1)
- So total: both get 3 - 2 = **1**

---

So the **total payoff matrix under C2** is:

| Your Action \ Other's Action | A0             | A1             |
|------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **A0**                       | 7, 7           | 2, 1           |
| **A1**                       | 1, 2           | 1, 1           |

Now, let’s analyze this.

From your perspective (Player 1):

- If other plays A0: you get 7 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If other plays A1: you get 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0

So **A0 is a dominant strategy** for you under C2.

Similarly, from Player 2’s perspective (same matrix), A0 is dominant for them too.

So under C2, **(A0, A0)** is the only Nash equilibrium — and it’s **strictly dominant**.

They both get 7, which is higher than the base game’s 5 — and the other outcomes are worse.

So **C2 creates a strong incentive to play A0**, with no risk of being exploited.

Even if the other plays A1, you get 2 (better than 0) and the other gets 1 (worse than 3), but that’s okay.

So C2 completely changes the game in favor of coordination on A0.

This is **very beneficial**.

But is it **fair**? From Player 2’s point of view: they proposed it, so likely they want it.

But wait: the contract says “if a player chooses A0, they receive +2 from the other player”, and “if A1, they pay 2 to the other”.

So both players are symmetric in the contract.

So it’s symmetric.

Both players get the same rules.

So if both approve it, it will be a mutually beneficial contract that leads to (A0, A0) equilibrium with 7 each — better than base game (5 each).

So **C2 is beneficial for both players if implemented**.

Now, what about **C1**? It does nothing — if both approve, the game remains the same.

Then the game could end in either (A0,A0) or (A1,A1), depending on coordination.

But (A0,A0) is better, but may not happen due to risk.

---

### **Step 4: Strategic Considerations**

We are to **approve** some contracts.

But the winning contract is the one with the **most approvals** — and if multiple have the same maximum approvals, it’s selected randomly.

But since there are only two players, a contract can get at most 2 approvals.

We want to **maximize our expected payoff**.

So we must estimate:

- What is likely to happen if we approve certain contracts?
- What contracts can be implemented?

Key insight: **We are Player 1**. We are proposing C1.

Player 2 is proposing C2.

Now, likely, **Player 2 will approve C2** — because it's in their interest.

Similarly, **we** might have a reason to approve C2.

But we must decide.

Option 1: Approve **only C2**.

Then:
- We approve C2 → 1 approval
- We don’t know if Player 2 approves C1 — but we assume they will likely **not approve C1**, because it gives nothing, and they proposed C2.
- But Player 2 may approve C2 (probably)?

Actually, Player 2 proposed C2 — they want it. So likely they approve C2.

Player 2 proposed C2, so they likely want it. So they will probably **approve C2**.

But they might not approve C1 — because C1 is a null contract, and they might see it as useless.

Similarly, we (Player 1) proposed C1 — we might approve it, but only if we think it helps.

Now, **if we approve both**:
- C1: we approve → 1 approval
- C2: we approve → 1 approval

Then both contracts have 1 approval (assuming Player 2 only approves C2).

So max approvals is 1. Then the winning contract is **chosen randomly** from all contracts with 1 approval: i.e., C1 and C2 with equal chance.

So with 50% probability, C1 is selected (no change), 50% C2 (good).

Then our expected payoff would be:
- 50%: base game (unknown outcome, but likely A0,A0 or A1,A1)
- 50%: C2 → leads to (A0,A0) with 7 points

But in the base game, what is the likely outcome?

Without coordination, players might play A0 or A1.

But since (A0,A0) gives 5, and (A1,A1) gives 3, and (A0,A1) gives 0 to one player, it's risky to play A0 unless you trust the other.

But with **random play**, or **symmetry**, maybe they coordinate on A0.

But we can assume that **in the base game (C1)**, players might play A0 with some probability.

But in the absence of commitment, mixed strategy equilibria exist.

Let’s compute the mixed strategy equilibrium in the base game.

---

### **Step 5: Mixed Strategy Equilibrium in Base Game**

Let Player 2 play A0 with probability p.

Player 1's expected payoff from playing A0:
- 5*p + 0*(1-p) = 5p

From playing A1:
- 3*p + 3*(1-p) = 3

Set equal for indifference:
5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So Player 2 mixes with p=0.6 in equilibrium.

Then Player 1's payoff: 5*(0.6) = 3

Similarly, symmetric.

So **in mixed strategy equilibrium**, **each player gets 3 points**.

But if they coordinate on (A0,A0), they get 5 each.

But without commitment, they may not coordinate.

But in many such games, players can **coordinate on A0** if they are rational and symmetric.

But in a one-shot game, it's uncertain.

So expected payoff in base game could be **around 3** if they play mixed, or **5** if they coordinate.

But let’s suppose they try to coordinate — but might fail.

But with C2, **we are guaranteed** to get 7, because A0 is dominant.

So C2 is strictly better than base game in any case.

Even in the best case of base game (5), C2 gives 7 — better.

In worst case (3), C2 gives 7 — still better.

So **C2 dominates the base game**.

Therefore, **we prefer C2 over C1**.

But C2 only passes if **both approve**.

Now, Player 2 proposed C2 → they likely **approve C2**.

But do they approve C1?

C1 is a null contract. It does nothing. So if they approve C1, it’s just a waste — but they might approve it to ensure some contract passes.

But since we (Player 1) control our approvals, we should try to **ensure that C2 is approved by both**.

So what should we do?

If we **approve C2**, and **Player 2 approves C2**, then C2 gets 2 approvals.

C1 gets only 1 (from us, unless Player 2 approves it).

So if we approve C2, and assume Player 2 approves C2 (they proposed it), then **C2 wins** (with 2 approvals).

If we do **not** approve C2, then C2 has only 1 approval.

C1: if we approve it, it has 1 approval.

So only one contract (C1) has 1 approval (unless Player 2 approves C1 too).

But if Player 2 does not approve C1, then only C1 has 1 approval → C1 wins.

But C1 is base game — we get maximum 5, but possibly only 3.

But if we approve **both**, and Player 2 approves C2, then:
- C1: 1 approval (us)
- C2: 2 approvals (us and them)

Then max approval = 2 → only C2 has 2 → C2 wins.

So **we can ensure that C2 wins**, by approving C2, and trusting that Player 2 will approve C2.

But what if we don't approve C2?

Then C2 has only 1 approval (if Player 2 approves it), and no other contract has more.

Then the max is 1.

Then winning contract is chosen randomly among all with 1 approval.

Suppose Player 2 approves C2 → it has 1 approval.
We might approve C1 → it has 1 approval (us).
So both C1 and C2 have 1 approval → one wins at random.

So 50% chance C1 (base game, ~3 to 5), 50% chance C2 (7).

So expected payoff: 0.5 * E[base] + 0.5 * 7

E[base] — best case: 5 (if coordinate), worst: 3 (mixed strategy).

But if we assume that in base game, they **can** coordinate on A0 (since it’s payoff-dominant), perhaps expected payoff is 5.

Even if not, it’s reasonable to expect around 5.

So expected: 0.5*5 + 0.5*7 = 2.5 + 3.5 = 6

But under C2, we are **guaranteed** 7 (if implemented).

But if we don’t approve C2, we only have **50% chance** to get 7, and 50% chance to get 5.

So expected: 6.

But if we **approve C2**, and assume Player 2 also approves it (they proposed it, so likely), then C2 passes with 2 approvals → we get 7 **for sure**.

So we go from **expected 6** to **guaranteed 7**.

Better.

What if Player 2 **does not approve C2**?

That seems unlikely — they proposed it.

But for completeness: if Player 2 does not approve C2, then C2 has 0 approvals.

Then only C1 can be approved (if we approve it).

Then C1 has 1 approval → wins.

We get base game payoff.

But again, they proposed C2, so we can reasonably assume they **will approve C2**.

Similarly, they might not approve C1, but we don’t care.

So **our best strategy is to approve C2**.

What about C1?

If we approve C1, and C2, and Player 2 approves C2, then C2 wins.

But if we **don’t approve C1**, and approve C2, and Player 2 approves C2 → C2 wins with 2 approvals → still wins.

So **approving C1 is unnecessary** — it doesn’t help.

But could we lose by not approving C1?

No.

In fact, **we should only approve contracts that improve our position or help get a better contract through approval**.

But **approving C1 does not help**, and only adds a contract that won’t win unless we both approve it, but we can let C2 win on its own.

Moreover, **we don't benefit from C1** — it’s the base game.

But **C2 is strictly better**.

Therefore, we should **only approve C2**.

But let’s confirm: is there any downside to not approving C1?

Only if the outcome is worse.

But if we don’t approve C1, and only approve C2, and Player 2 approves C2 → C2 wins → we get 7.

Perfect.

If Player 2 does **not** approve C2 (unlikely), then C2 has no approvals, C1 has 1 (us) → C1 wins → base game → we get max 5.

But that’s a risk due to Player 2's behavior — but we can’t control that.

But since Player 2 proposed C2, they **want** it, so we can rely on them approving it.

Hence, **our best move is to approve C2**.

**Do we approve C1?**

C1 is a null contract. It gives **no benefit**, and **no cost**.

But it doesn’t help us get a better outcome than C2.

Moreover, if we approve both, but C2 still wins (because it has more approvals), then C1 does nothing.

But if we **don’t approve C1**, it still doesn't hurt.

But is it harmful?

Only if C1 somehow prevented C2 from winning — but no, the voting is independent.

The winning contract is the one with **maximum number of approvals**, and if multiple tie, random.

But if we approve C2, and Player 2 approves C2 → C2 has 2 approvals.

C1 has only 1 (us), so not tied.

So C2 wins.

But if we don’t approve C1, it gets 0, so even better.

So we should **not approve C1**, because:
- It doesn’t give us anything
- It doesn’t help C2 win
- It wastes a vote (but approval voting: no penalty)

But we have no reason to approve it.

In fact, **if we approve both**, and suppose Player 2 approves C2 but not C1, then:
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 2 approvals → C2 wins

No problem.

But if Player 2 does approve both, then:
- C1: 2 approvals
- C2: 2 approvals → both have max (2) → one wins at random

Then 50% chance of C1 (base game), 50% C2 (7)

So our expected payoff: 0.5*5 + 0.5*7 = 6

But if we **do not** approve C1, then:
- C1: 0 approvals
- C2: 2 approvals → C2 wins → guaranteed 7

So we get **7** for sure.

Therefore, **by not approving C1, we eliminate the risk** of getting the worse contract (C1), even if Player 2 approves both.

So to **maximize our guaranteed outcome**, we should **not approve C1**.

Thus, the optimal decision:
- Approve **C2** (to get a 7)
- **Do not approve C1** (to avoid risk of getting base game, and no benefit)

Even if Player 2 approves C1, we avoid the risk.

Therefore, as Player 1, we should **approve only C2**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine whether you (Player 2) should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game without any contract

The payoff matrix is as follows, with Player 1's choice on rows and Player 2's choice on columns. Since you are **Player 2**, your payoffs are listed second in each cell:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| A0                  | (5,5)    | (0,3)    |
| A1                  | (3,0)    | (3,3)    |

So for Player 2 (you):
- If both play A0 → 5 points
- You play A0, opponent plays A1 → 0 points
- You play A1, opponent plays A0 → 3 points
- Both play A1 → 3 points

This game resembles a variant of the **coordination game** but with asymmetric payoffs in the mixed outcomes.

Now, consider strategic implications.

---

### Step 2: Analyze equilibrium strategies without any contract

We want to find the Nash equilibrium of this game.

Suppose Player 1 chooses A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1−p).  
You (Player 2) choose A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q).

Expected payoff for Player 2 (you):

- If you play A0:
  - EV(A0) = p * 5 + (1−p) * 0 = 5p
- If you play A1:
  - EV(A1) = p * 3 + (1−p) * 3 = 3

For you to be indifferent between A0 and A1 (required in mixed strategy), set:
5p = 3 ⇒ p = 3/5 = 0.6

So if Player 1 plays A0 with 0.6 probability, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Now compute Player 1’s best response.  
If you play A0 with probability q, then:

- Player 1’s EV of A0 = q * 5 + (1−q) * 3 = 5q + 3(1−q) = 2q + 3
- Player 1’s EV of A1 = q * 0 + (1−q) * 3 = 3(1−q)

Set equal for indifference:
2q + 3 = 3(1−q)
2q + 3 = 3 − 3q
2q + 3q = 3 − 3
5q = 0 → q = 0

So Player 1 is only indifferent when q = 0 (i.e., you always play A1). But that contradicts the assumption that you randomize.

Alternatively, if q < 0.6, Player 1 prefers A0; if q > 0.6, Player 1 prefers A1?

Wait — let's recompute correctly.

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 5q + 3(1−q) = 2q + 3
- A1: 0*q + 3*(1−q) = 3 − 3q

Compare: 
A0 > A1 when 2q + 3 > 3 − 3q → 2q + 3q > 0 → 5q > 0 → q > 0

So if q > 0, then A0 yields higher payoff for Player 1.  
Thus, unless q = 0, Player 1 strictly prefers A0.

But if player 1 always plays A0, then your best response is:
- A0 → 5
- A1 → 0? No! Wait:

If Player 1 plays A0 for sure:
- Your A0 gives 5
- Your A1 gives 3 → so better to play A0

If Player 1 plays A1 for sure:
- Your A0 gives 0
- Your A1 gives 3 → better to play A1

So no pure-strategy equilibrium?

But wait — is (A0,A0) an equilibrium?
- Player 1 gets 5, if deviates to A1 → gets 3, so no incentive.
- Player 2 gets 5, if deviates to A1 → gets 0, so no incentive.
→ Yes! (A0,A0) is a strict Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, check (A1,A1):
- Player 1 gets 3. If deviates to A0 → gets 0? (since opponent plays A1 → if you play A0, you get 0). So yes, 3 > 0 → no deviation.
- Player 2 gets 3. If deviates to A0 → gets 0 → worse.
→ So (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

Now check (A0,A1):
- Player 1 (A0): gets 3, if he switches to A1 → gets 3 (same), so okay.
- Player 2 (A1): gets 0, if switches to A0 → gets 5 → better! So not equilibrium.

Similarly, (A1,A0):
- Player 1 gets 0 → if switches to A0 → gets 5 → better → not equilibrium.

So there are **two pure-strategy Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Also possible mixed-strategy equilibrium? Let's see.

But crucial point: **Your objective is to maximize your own expected total points over time (assuming multiple rounds or repeated interaction)**. However, since no information about repetition is given, we assume one-shot interaction with rational players, and equilibrium behavior.

Given two equilibria, coordination is critical. Without communication, players might fail to coordinate.

---

### Step 3: Now consider the contract

The contract proposed (via approval voting) says:

> - If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
> - If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

So **the contract adds zero payment under any action**.

In other words:
- The contract has **no effect on payoffs**.
- It does not impose any cost or reward based on action.
- It does not alter the original payoff matrix at all.

Therefore, **signing the contract provides no benefit or cost**.

However, the contract becomes active **only if all players sign it**. So if you sign, but the other player doesn't, the contract does nothing. If you don’t sign, it doesn’t apply regardless.

But if both sign, it's still just a null contract — no change.

---

### Step 4: Should you sign?

You must decide whether to sign given that the contract does **nothing** — no change in incentives, no new risks, no benefits.

There are **no strategic advantages** to signing such a contract. It does not help induce coordination, nor does it punish deviations.

Moreover, the contract doesn’t add credibility to any action — it doesn't create binding commitments.

Since the contract has **zero impact** on your payoffs regardless of the actions taken, there is **no reason to sign** purely for self-interest.

But — could signing help coordinate on a better equilibrium?

Let’s explore.

Currently, there are two pure equilibria: (A0,A0) with 5 points each, and (A1,A1) with 3 points each.

**(A0,A0)** is better for you (5 vs 3).

If you could somehow coordinate players on A0, that would be ideal.

But the contract does **nothing** to improve coordination. It adds no signal, no incentive structure.

Even if both signed, the payoffs remain unchanged.

So even if the other player signs, it doesn't alter their strategy or yours.

Hence, **no strategic benefit** from the contract.

Could there be downside?

Only if the contract imposed costs — but it doesn’t.

So: **Signing causes no harm, but provides no benefit.**

Thus, from a self-interested rational perspective, **you should sign only if there's some cost to not signing, or if it helps coordination**.

But here:
- No cost to refusing.
- No benefit to signing.
- Contract doesn't affect outcome.

Therefore, **signing is not required**, and since there’s **no advantage**, you should be indifferent.

But the decision is binary: sign or not.

And since there’s **no benefit**, and **no risk**, the rational choice depends on preferences.

But remember: **you're maximizing your total points**.

Since signing doesn't change anything, it's **neutral**.

But — is there any chance the contract changes the game’s outcome in a way that improves your payoff?

Answer: **No.** Because the contract adds **zero monetary impact**.

Thus, signing has **no effect** on expected payoff.

So, **your expected payoff is identical whether you sign or not.**

However — suppose the other player sees you signing and interprets it as a commitment to A0? But the contract imposes **no constraints** on what you do. You can still choose A1 freely, and receive no penalty.

So it’s not credible.

Hence, it cannot shift behavior.

---

### Final Decision

You are asked to either sign or not sign.

But since signing produces **no change in payoffs**, and you’re aiming to **maximize your expected points**, there is **no reason to sign** — because it doesn’t help.

Moreover, if you expect the other player to sign (because they approved), and you think they’re rational, they won’t change behavior due to the contract.

So **there is zero benefit**.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to **not sign**, unless there is an external cost or benefit — but there isn’t.

But wait — what if someone else wants you to sign to make a point? Or to signal something?

No — we operate under the assumption of self-interest and rationality.

Thus, **do not sign**, because it offers no gain and may complicate coordination unnecessarily (but again, even that doesn't apply here).

Final answer: **Do not sign.**

Why? Because the contract does nothing, so signing adds no value and costs nothing — but since you’re trying to maximize points, and there is **no positive impact**, you are indifferent.

But when indifferent, **you are free to choose**. However, since **optimal behavior is to avoid unnecessary actions**, especially when they serve no purpose, **refusing is the rational choice**.

Also, note: the contract only activates if **all sign**, so if you alone sign, nothing happens. If everyone signs, nothing happens. So signing **by itself** achieves nothing.

Therefore, **you should not sign**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, we first analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating both the base payoffs and the effects of the payment contract.

**Step 1: Base Payoffs (Player 1, Player 2)**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

**Step 2: Incorporate the Contract**
The contract states: "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 point(s), drawn equally from the other players."
- **Case (A0, A0):** Player 1 receives 4 from Player 2, and Player 2 receives 4 from Player 1. Net change for both is 0.
  Payoff: (5 + 4 - 4, 5 + 4 - 4) = **(5, 5)**
- **Case (A0, A1):** Player 1 receives 4 from Player 2 (who chose A1).
  Payoff: (0 + 4, 3 - 4) = **(4, -1)**
- **Case (A1, A0):** Player 2 receives 4 from Player 1 (who chose A1).
  Payoff: (3 - 4, 0 + 4) = **(-1, 4)**
- **Case (A1, A1):** No additional payments are made.
  Payoff: **(3, 3)**

**Step 3: Analyze the Adjusted Matrix**
| | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5) | (4, -1) |
| **Player 1: A1** | (-1, 4) | (3, 3) |

**Step 4: Determine Dominant Strategies**
- **For Player 2 (me):** 
  - If Player 1 chooses A0, Player 2's best response is A0 (5 > -1).
  - If Player 1 chooses A1, Player 2's best response is A0 (4 > 3).
  Action A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy** for Player 2.
- **For Player 1:**
  - If Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1's best response is A0 (5 > -1).
  - If Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1's best response is A0 (4 > 3).
  Action A0 is a **strictly dominant strategy** for Player 1.

**Step 5: Final Decision**
Since A0 is the dominant strategy for both players, the Nash Equilibrium is (A0, A0), which yields 5 points for each player. Even if Player 1 played suboptimally, A0 remains the best choice for Player 2 in all scenarios.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game (No Contracts)

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:

|  | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|---|---|---|
| I play A0 | 5 | 0 |
| I play A1 | 3 | 3 |

This is a symmetric coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5 points (efficient)
- **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3 points

## Step 2: Analyze Contract 1 (C1)
No payments - this is just the base game.

For mixed strategies: I prefer A0 when the other player plays A0 with probability > 3/5 (60%).
- Mixed Nash equilibrium gives each player 3 points expected value

## Step 3: Analyze Contract 2 (C2)  
Players choosing A1 pay 1 point to the other player.

Modified payoffs:
|  | Other plays A0 | Other plays A1 |
|---|---|---|
| I play A0 | 5 | 0+1=1 |
| I play A1 | 3-1=2 | 3-1+1=3 |

For mixed strategies: I prefer A0 when the other player plays A0 with probability > 2/5 (40%).
- Mixed Nash equilibrium gives each player 2.6 points expected value

## Step 4: Compare Risk Dominance

**Critical insight**: Under C2, I only need 40% confidence that the other player will choose A0 to make A0 my best response, compared to 60% under C1.

This means:
- **C2 makes the efficient equilibrium (A0, A0) risk-dominant**
- C2 reduces miscoordination penalties (getting 1 instead of 0)
- C2 makes it easier for both players to coordinate on the best outcome

While the mixed Nash is worse under C2 (2.6 vs 3.0), the reduced coordination barrier makes achieving the efficient (5,5) outcome more likely.

## Conclusion

C2 is superior because it facilitates coordination on the efficient equilibrium, which is the primary challenge in this game.

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

response:
Let's carefully analyze the game step by step, incorporating the contract and its implications.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without contract)

The base game is a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix (for Player 1) is:

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

This is similar to a coordination game with a twist: A0 is better if both choose it, but if one chooses A0 and the other A1, the A0 player gets nothing while the A1 player gets 3. Choosing A1 always gives at least 3, regardless of the opponent.

Now, let’s consider the **best response** structure.

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1’s payoff: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → so prefer A0.
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1’s payoff: A0 → 0, A1 → 3 → so prefer A1.

So Player 1’s best response depends on what Player 2 does.

This is not a dominant strategy for either action. The Nash equilibria in pure strategies are:
- (A0, A0): both get 5 — but unstable if one deviates to A1 (gets 3 instead of 5, but the other gets 0 instead of 5)
- (A1, A1): both get 3 — stable, since deviating to A0 would give 0 if the other plays A1.

But (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium: if both play A0, neither wants to deviate (since deviating to A1 gives only 3, which is worse than 5).

So there are **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1). Also, there is a mixed strategy equilibrium.

But the key is: without contracts, the game has strategic uncertainty.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract is proposed by Player 2 and approved via voting. It says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 points, drawn equally from the other players.
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players.

Important: “drawn equally from the other players” — meaning, **if you play A0, you get +2, and that 2 comes from the other player (Player 2)**.
Similarly, if you play A1, you pay -2, which is distributed to the other player.

So it’s **a transfer** from the other player to you based on your action.

Let’s formalize the **net payoff** under this contract.

Assume you are Player 1. Player 2 is the other player.

Let’s suppose the contract is **signed by both players**. Then the total payoffs (including contract terms) are adjusted as follows:

#### Payoff adjustments:

- If Player 1 plays A0 → gets +2 from Player 2 (because A0 gives +2, paid by the other player)
- If Player 1 plays A1 → pays -2 to Player 2
- Similarly, if Player 2 plays A0 → gets +2 from Player 1
- If Player 2 plays A1 → pays -2 to Player 1

So the final total payoffs are:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (5 + 2, 5 - 2) = (7, 3) | (0 - 2, 3 + 2) = (-2, 5) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (3 - 2, 0 + 2) = (1, 2) | (3 - 2, 3 - 2) = (1, 1) |

Wait! Let’s double-check.

- When P1 plays A0 → P1 gets +2 from P2.
- When P1 plays A1 → P1 pays 2 to P2 → so P1 gets -2.
- When P2 plays A0 → P2 gets +2 from P1.
- When P2 plays A1 → P2 pays 2 to P1 → so P1 gets +2.

So we adjust the original payoffs:

#### Case 1: P1=A0, P2=A0
- P1: 5 (base) + 2 (from contract, since P1 chose A0) = 7
- P2: 5 (base) + 2 (from contract, since P2 chose A0) = 7? Wait — hold on.

Wait! There's a **critical ambiguity**: Who pays? "drawn equally from the other players" — but there’s only one other player. So it’s straightforward.

But how is the money distributed?

- If you choose A0, you get +2, paid **by the other player**.
- If you choose A1, you pay -2, paid **to the other player**.

So for P1:
- Choosing A0 → +2 from P2
- Choosing A1 → -2 to P2

For P2:
- Choosing A0 → +2 from P1
- Choosing A1 → -2 to P1

So yes, the payments are **direct transfers** between the two players.

So final payoffs:

| P1 \ P2 | A0        | A1        |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0** | (5+2, 5+2) = (7, 7) | (0-2, 3+2) = (-2, 5) |
| **A1** | (3-2, 0-2) = (1, -2) | (3-2, 3-2) = (1, 1) |

Wait — that doesn't seem right.

Wait! Clarify:

- The **additional payment** is **based on your own action**, and it's **funded by the other player**.

So:
- If P1 plays A0 → gains +2 (from P2)
- If P1 plays A1 → loses -2 (to P2)

- If P2 plays A0 → gains +2 (from P1)
- If P2 plays A1 → loses -2 (to P1)

So for each outcome, we add:

- P1’s payoff = base payoff + (2 if P1 played A0) + (-2 if P2 played A1)  
**Wait, no**: The contract says the payment is **based on your action**, not based on the other’s.

So:
- The **contract payment to P1** is:
  - +2 if P1 chooses A0
  - -2 if P1 chooses A1

Similarly, the **contract payment to P2** is:
  - +2 if P2 chooses A0
  - -2 if P2 chooses A1

These are **independent of the other player's action**.

So we just **add** those to the base payoff.

Therefore:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (base: P1 gets 5 / P2 gets 5) | A1 (base: P1 gets 0 / P2 gets 3) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **A0** | P1: 5 + 2 = 7; P2: 5 + 2 = 7      | P1: 0 + 2 = 2; P2: 3 + 2 = 5      |
| **A1** | P1: 3 - 2 = 1; P2: 0 - 2 = -2     | P1: 3 - 2 = 1; P2: 3 - 2 = 1      |

Wait — no:

If P1 plays A1 → P1 pays -2 → so P1’s total payoff = base + (-2) = 3 - 2 = 1  
P2 gets +2 if P2 plays A1? No!

Hold on.

The contract says: "If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 points, distributed equally among the other players."

So:
- P1 choosing A1 → P1 pays 2 → so P1 gets -2
- That payment is **distributed to the other players** — but only one other player → so P2 gets +2

Similarly:
- P1 choosing A0 → P1 gets +2 (from other player(s)) → so P2 pays 2 to P1
- P2 choosing A1 → P2 pays 2 → P1 gets +2
- P2 choosing A0 → P2 gets +2 (from P1)

So the **contract affects both players based on their own actions**, and the **net transfer** between them depends on the actions.

So now, let’s compute the full payoffs, considering both the base outcome and the contract.

Let’s define:

- Contract payment to P1 = 
  - +2 if P1 plays A0
  - -2 if P1 plays A1

- Contract payment to P2 = 
  - +2 if P2 plays A0
  - -2 if P2 plays A1

And the base payoffs are from the original game.

So full payoffs:

#### Case 1: P1=A0, P2=A0
- Base: (5,5)
- Pay: (+2, +2)
- Total: (7, 7)

#### Case 2: P1=A0, P2=A1
- Base: (0, 3)
- Pay: (+2, -2)  [P1:A0 → +2, P2:A1 → -2]
- Total: (0+2, 3-2) = (2, 1)

Wait — P2 gets -2 from contract, but base is 3 → 3 - 2 = 1

But P1 gets +2 → 0 + 2 = 2

So (2, 1)

#### Case 3: P1=A1, P2=A0
- Base: (3, 0)
- Pay: (-2, +2)
- Total: (3-2, 0+2) = (1, 2)

#### Case 4: P1=A1, P2=A1
- Base: (3, 3)
- Pay: (-2, -2)
- Total: (3-2, 3-2) = (1, 1)

So the **contracted payoff matrix** is:

| P1 \ P2 | A0        | A1        |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0** | (7, 7)    | (2, 1)    |
| **A1** | (1, 2)    | (1, 1)    |

---

### Step 3: Analyze the game with the contract

We are Player 1. We are deciding whether to sign the contract.

The contract is only active if **both** sign it. We are considering signing it only if it improves our expected payoff **assuming the other player will also sign (and play rationally)**.

So we must compare:
- Your expected payoff **if you sign the contract** and both players act rationally (i.e., in equilibrium).
- Your expected payoff **if you do not sign the contract**, meaning the game reverts to the original base game.

But note: if you **do not sign**, the contract is inactive. The other player might sign or not, but since the contract requires **all players** to sign, if you don’t sign, contract is not active.

So we compare:

- **Option 1**: Sign contract → game becomes the contracted game above → we play the new matrix → find equilibrium → compute our expected payoff.
- **Option 2**: Do not sign → game reverts to base game → find equilibrium → compute our expected payoff.

We choose the option that gives higher expected payoff.

But here’s a key point: the other player (Player 2) is also rational, and will decide whether to sign the contract **based on their own incentives**.

But we are told: **"the contract was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2)"**, and now **you are asked whether to sign**.

This implies that Player 2 **has already voted to sign**, and we are the final decision-maker.

So, **Player 2 has already decided to sign**.

Now, **you are deciding whether to sign**, and the contract only becomes active if both sign.

So two scenarios:

1. **You sign** → contract active → game becomes the contracted game → both play optimally → you get expected payoff from that equilibrium.
2. **You don’t sign** → contract inactive → game is base game → both play optimally → you get expected payoff from base game equilibrium.

So the decision is: do we expect higher payoff under the contracted game (if we sign) or the base game (if we don’t sign)?

So we need to find:
- The (Nash) equilibrium in the **contracted game**
- The (Nash) equilibrium in the **base game**
- Compare expected payoffs

Let’s do that.

---

### Step 4: Find equilibrium in the **contracted game**

Matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0      | A1      |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **A0** | (7,7)   | (2,1)   |
| **A1** | (1,2)   | (1,1)   |

Find best responses.

For **P1**:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 7 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0

So P1 **always prefers A0**, regardless of P2’s action.

For **P2**:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 7 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 2 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0

So P2 also **always prefers A0**, regardless of P1’s action.

So the only (pure) Nash equilibrium is (A0, A0).

Both players play A0.

Expected payoff: **P1 gets 7**, **P2 gets 7**

Now, what about mixed strategies? Since each player has a **strictly dominant strategy (A0)**, the only equilibrium is pure (A0, A0). No need for mixed.

So if you sign the contract, and Player 2 signs (already committed), then **both will play A0**, and you get **7 points**.

---

### Step 5: Find equilibrium in the **base game**

Matrix:

| P1 \ P2 | A0      | A1      |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **A0** | (5,5)   | (0,3)   |
| **A1** | (3,0)   | (3,3)   |

Best responses:

P1:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1: A0 → 0, A1 → 3 → prefer A1

P2:
- If P1 plays A0: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: A0 → 0, A1 → 3 → prefer A1

So:
- (A0, A0): both best responses → Nash
- (A1, A1): both best responses → Nash

Mixed strategy equilibrium: let’s find it.

Let P(P2 plays A0) = q

P1’s expected payoff:
- A0: 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q
- A1: 3q + 3(1-q) = 3

P1 is indifferent when 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So P1 plays A0 with probability 3/5 if P2 plays A0 with prob 0.6

Now for P2: let P(P1 plays A0) = p

P2’s payoff:
- A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5

So mixed strategy Nash equilibrium: each plays A0 with probability 3/5, A1 with 0.4

Now, what is P1’s expected payoff in this equilibrium?

P1’s expected payoff:

- If P1 plays A0: 5 * (3/5) + 0 * (2/5) = 3
- If P1 plays A1: 3 * (3/5) + 3 * (2/5) = 9/5 + 6/5 = 15/5 = 3

So expected payoff is **3**, regardless.

In pure strategy equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → P1 gets 5
- (A1, A1) → P1 gets 3

But in a **rational player setting**, we must consider which equilibrium is played. Since there are two pure equilibria, and no coordination, **risk dominance** or **focal points** might matter.

But in the absence of communication, players might be uncertain.

However, the **mixed strategy equilibrium** gives a **guaranteed expected payoff of 3**.

But the **(A1,A1)** equilibrium gives 3, same as mixed.

The **(A0,A0)** gives 5, but is risky — if one player miscoordinates, you get 0.

In many such games, (A0,A0) is **risk-dominated** because it's more fragile.

But let’s suppose players are rational and **could coordinate** on (A0,A0) — then payoff is 5.

But if they **fail to coordinate**, and one plays A1, then P1 gets 0.

So **expected payoff depends on beliefs**.

But if we take the **standard solution concept** for such games (symmetric coordination game), and assume **no communication**, then **the mixed strategy equilibrium is often considered**.

However, **since the game is symmetric and has two pure equilibria**, a rational player might play **A0** with some probability, but in equilibrium it’s 3/5.

But **Player 2 also has the same incentive**, so we fall into mixed strategy: each plays A0 w.p. 3/5.

So **expected payoff for P1 is 3**.

Alternatively, if players could coordinate, they might play (A0,A0) and get 5.

But we must decide: what is a **rational expectation**?

In the absence of communication, **rational players** would likely **not expect to coordinate** on (A0,A0) due to its fragility. Thus, the **mixed strategy is safer**.

But let’s be precise.

Suppose both players are rational and know each other are rational, and know the game.

They know (A0,A0) is better, but they are uncertain.

In such cases, **the mixed strategy equilibrium is the only one that doesn't require coordination**.

Moreover, in game theory, when multiple pure equilibria exist, **the mixed equilibrium is often taken as the default** for prediction.

But there's another way: we can ask: in the **base game**, what would a player expect?

But note: if we **don’t sign** the contract, and Player 2 is rational, they may also have a strategy.

But here’s a key insight: in the **contracted game**, **A0 is a dominant strategy**, so we know the outcome is **(A0,A0)** for sure → **you get 7**.

In the **base game**, your expected payoff **in the mixed equilibrium is 3**, but in a pure equilibrium you could get 5.

But is 5 achievable?

Only if both players coordinate on A0.

But they are rational, so they might try to coordinate.

However, in standard game theory, without communication, **the mixed strategy equilibrium is the only one guaranteed to be played**.

Alternatively, we can consider the **maximin** strategy.

P1's maximin payoff:
- If you play A0: min payoff = min(5, 0) = 0
- If you play A1: min payoff = min(3, 3) = 3

So maximin is 3 (play A1)

But this is not optimal if others play A0.

But again, uncertainty.

Given this uncertainty, **in the base game**, the safe expected payoff is **3** (from mixed equilibrium or even from playing A1).

But in the **contracted game**, you **know** you get **7**, because the contract makes A0 dominant.

So even if the other player is uncertain, **A0 dominates A1**, so they will play A0, and you get 7.

Therefore, **signing the contract guarantees you 7**, **without risk**.

While **not signing** gives you a **maximum of 5** in the best case, and **only 3 in the mixed case**, or even lower if you mis-coordinate.

So the **expected payoff under contract** is **7**, **certain**.

The **expected payoff under no contract** is **at most 5** (if coordination happens), but likely **3** in rational play.

Thus, **signing the contract is strictly better**.

---

### Step 6: Final decision

You are Player 1.

- If you **sign** the contract → contract active → you and P2 play (A0, A0) → you get **7**
- If you **don’t sign** → base game → expected payoff **≤ 5**, probably **3** in equilibrium

So **7 > 3**, so you should sign.

Even if coordination on (A0,A0) happens in the base game (giving you 5), 7 is still better.

So **signing gives higher guaranteed payoff**.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base payoff (without the contract)

The base game is a two-player simultaneous move game with the following payoffs (Player 1's payoff in each cell):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

So:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

This resembles a coordination game with a twist — A0 gives high payoff only when both choose it, but if you choose A0 and the other chooses A1, you get 0.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract — it changes the payoffs

The contract states:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other players.

Important implications:
- **If you choose A0**, you get **+4 points**.
- **If the other player chooses A0**, they get **+4 points**, and **you lose 4 points** (since it's "drawn equally from the other players").
- If **both choose A0**, then:
  - You get +4 for choosing A0
  - But the other player also chooses A0 → they get +4, and **you lose 4** (since the cost is drawn from you)
  - So net for you: +4 (from your A0) – 4 (from the other player’s A0) = **0 net from contract**
- If you choose A0 and the other chooses A1:
  - You get +4 (for your A0)
  - Other player chooses A1 → no additional payment → so no cost to you
  - So you get +4 from contract
- If you choose A1 and the other chooses A0:
  - You do **not** get +4
  - But the other player gets +4, and **you lose 4 points** (because the contract draws from you)
- If both choose A1: nothing changes

So, we must revise the payoff matrix to include **contract-adjusted payoffs**.

Let’s build the **net payoff matrix including contract effects**.

---

### Step 3: Build the revised payoff matrix (with contract)

Let’s define payoffs as: (Your payoff, Other player’s payoff)

#### Case 1: (A0, A0)
- Base: (5, 5)
- Contract: You gain +4, but the other player gains +4 → you lose 4 → net: 4 – 4 = 0
- So your total: 5 (base) + 0 (net contract) = **5**
- Other player: 5 + 0 = **5**
→ (5, 5)

Wait: let's be precise.

**Contract rule:** "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 4 points, drawn equally from the other players."

"Drawn equally from the other players" — this is ambiguous.

Let’s parse: "drawn equally from the other players"

Does this mean:
- The 4 points come from **each** other player?
- Or the 4 points come from the **pool** of other players?

But the wording is: "from the other players", plural.

So if **you** choose A0, you receive 4 points, **and** this 4 points is drawn from the other players **collectively**.

So if **you** choose A0, you gain 4, and **you** pay 4 to them.

But if **both** choose A0, then:
- You gain 4, but also **both you and the other player** are "other player" to each other?
- So each player's A0 triggers an additional 4-point payment **to them**, **from the other player**.

Wait — this suggests that **each A0 choice results in 4 points being subtracted from the other player and added to the chooser**.

So:
- If you choose A0: +4 to you, –4 to the other player.
- If other player chooses A0: +4 to them, –4 to you.

Thus:
- If **both choose A0**: you get +4 (from your A0) – 4 (from their A0) = 0 net from contract.
- So **contract net effect is 0 for both**.

If **you A0, other A1**:
- You get +4 (from your A0), no cost (other didn't choose A0), so +4.
- Other: no +4 (you didn’t choose A0), and no loss — so 0.

If **you A1, other A0**:
- You: no +4 (you chose A1), but other chose A0 → you lose 4 → -4
- Other: +4 (they chose A0), and you didn't choose A0 → no loss → +4

If **both A1**: nothing changes.

So the **contract effect** can be summarized as:

| (Your Choice, Other's Choice) | Contract Effect on You | Contract Effect on Other |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| A0, A0                        | 0                       | 0                         |
| A0, A1                        | +4                      | 0                         |
| A1, A0                        | –4                      | +4                        |
| A1, A1                        | 0                       | 0                         |

Now add this to the base payoffs.

---

### Step 4: Compute full payoffs (base + contract)

#### 1. (A0, A0)
- Base: (5, 5)
- Contract: (0, 0)
→ Final: **(5, 5)**

#### 2. (A0, A1)
- Base: (0, 3)
- Contract: (+4, 0)
→ Final: **(4, 3)**

#### 3. (A1, A0)
- Base: (3, 0)
- Contract: (–4, +4)
→ Final: **(–1, 4)**

#### 4. (A1, A1)
- Base: (3, 3)
- Contract: (0, 0)
→ Final: **(3, 3)**

So updated payoff matrix:

|               | A0         | A1         |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**        | (5, 5)     | (4, 3)     |
| **A1**        | (-1, 4)    | (3, 3)     |

---

### Step 5: Analyze the game — what strategy maximizes your expected payoff?

You are Player 1. You choose a mixed strategy: let **p = probability of choosing A0**, then **1–p = probability of A1**.

Let **q = probability that Player 2 chooses A0**, then **1–q = A1**.

Your expected payoff:

E = p*q*(5) + p*(1–q)*(4) + (1–p)*q*(-1) + (1–p)*(1–q)*(3)

Let’s simplify:

E = 5pq + 4p(1–q) + (–1)(1–p)q + 3(1–p)(1–q)

Expand:

= 5pq + 4p – 4pq – q + pq + 3(1 – p – q + pq)

Wait: let's do it carefully:

1. 5pq  
2. 4p(1–q) = 4p – 4pq  
3. –q(1–p) = –q + pq  
4. 3(1–p)(1–q) = 3(1 – p – q + pq) = 3 – 3p – 3q + 3pq

Now sum all:

E = 5pq + (4p – 4pq) + (–q + pq) + (3 – 3p – 3q + 3pq)

Combine like terms:

- Constants: 3  
- p terms: 4p – 3p = p  
- q terms: –q – 3q = –4q  
- pq terms: 5pq – 4pq + pq + 3pq = (5 – 4 + 1 + 3) pq = 5pq

So:

**E = 3 + p – 4q + 5pq**

This is your expected payoff as a function of p and q.

Now: **you choose p**, but **q is chosen by Player 2**, who is rational and also wants to maximize their own payoff.

We need to find a **Nash equilibrium**.

But since you're trying to **maximize your own payoff**, and Player 2 is also rational, you should assume they will play optimally in response to your strategy.

So let's analyze **best response** of Player 2, given your choice of p.

But you also want to pick p to **maximize your guaranteed or expected payoff**, under the assumption that Player 2 will respond optimally.

So let’s consider **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose Player 2 uses q (probability of A0). Player 2 wants to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s compute Player 2's expected payoff.

Recall the full payoff matrix:

|               | A0         | A1         |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**        | (5, 5)     | (4, 3)     |
| **A1**        | (-1, 4)    | (3, 3)     |

Player 2’s payoff:
- If they play A0: p*(5) + (1–p)*(4) = 5p + 4(1–p) = 5p + 4 – 4p = p + 4
- If they play A1: p*(3) + (1–p)*(3) = 3p + 3(1–p) = 3p + 3 – 3p = 3

So Player 2’s expected payoff:
- A0: p + 4
- A1: 3

Player 2 will choose:
- A0 if p + 4 > 3 → p > –1 → always true, since p ≥ 0
- A1 if p + 4 < 3 → p < –1 → impossible
- So **Player 2 strictly prefers A0 whenever p + 4 > 3 → p > –1**, which is always true.

Wait: p + 4 > 3 → p > –1 → always true since p ≥ 0.

So **for any p ≥ 0, Player 2 gets more from A0 than from A1**.

Even if p = 0: A0 gives 0 + 4 = 4, A1 gives 3 → so A0 is better.

So **Player 2 will always choose A0**, no matter what you do.

Is that true?

Wait: let's double-check:

Player 2’s:
- If they play A0: expected payoff = p*(5) + (1–p)*(4) = 5p + 4 – 4p = p + 4
- If they play A1: p*(3) + (1–p)*(3) = 3

So A0 payoff: p + 4  
A1 payoff: 3

So A0 > A1 whenever p + 4 > 3 → p > –1 → always true.

So indeed, **for all p in [0,1], A0 is strictly better for Player 2 than A1**.

Therefore, **Player 2 will always play A0 with probability 1** in equilibrium.

That’s a crucial insight.

So regardless of what you do, Player 2 will choose A0 for sure.

Therefore, you know the other player will choose A0 with probability 1.

So **you can now decide your optimal strategy knowing that Player 2 will choose A0 every time**.

So your expected payoff depends only on your choice of p (probability of A0).

Let’s compute your expected payoff in this case.

If Player 2 chooses A0 with probability 1, then:

- If you choose A0: payoff = 5 (from base) + 0 (contract net) = 5
- If you choose A1: payoff = –1 (from base) + 0 (contract) = –1

So you should **choose A0** for sure.

Wait: so best response is to choose A0 with probability 1.

But wait — let’s verify using the full formula.

You set p, they set q = 1.

Your expected payoff: E = 3 + p – 4q + 5pq = 3 + p – 4(1) + 5p(1) = 3 + p – 4 + 5p = (–1) + 6p

So E = 6p – 1

This is increasing in p.

So maximum when p = 1 → E = 6(1) – 1 = 5

If p = 0 → E = –1

So indeed, best to play A0 with probability 1.

So **you should choose A0 with 100% probability**.

But wait — is this consistent?

Player 2 plays A0 for sure → you get:
- If you play A0: (5,5) → you get 5
- If you play A1: (–1, 4) → you get –1 → worse

So yes, A0 is strictly better.

Therefore, your best response is to choose A0 with probability 1.

And since Player 2 knows this, and always prefers A0 regardless of what you do, they will choose A0.

So the unique Nash equilibrium is:
- You: A0 with 100%
- Other player: A0 with 100%

And you get 5 points.

Is there any incentive for you not to do this?

Suppose you deviate and play A1 sometimes.

But that would give you lower expected payoff, since your expected payoff is 6p – 1 → increases with p.

So no.

Could Player 2 ever choose A1? Only if p + 4 < 3 → p < –1 → impossible.

So no.

Thus, **your optimal strategy is to play A0 with probability 100%**.

On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Let's break this down step by step to determine whether you should sign the contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without contract)

The original game is a simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1’s payoff, Player 2’s payoff):

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

This is **not** a standard prisoner's dilemma, but it's similar in structure.

Let’s analyze the best responses:

- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1 gets 5 (if A0), 3 (if A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1 gets 0 (if A0), 3 (if A1) → prefers A1

So Player 1’s best response depends on Player 2’s action.

Now look at Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 5 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A0
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 0 (A0), 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So both players have a mixed strategy best response.

Let’s compute the Nash equilibrium (if we assume no contract).

Let p = probability Player 1 plays A0  
Let q = probability Player 2 plays A0

Player 1’s expected payoff:
- If A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- If A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

Player 1 is indifferent when 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

Similarly, Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
- If A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3

Player 2 is indifferent when 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So the unique Nash equilibrium is (p = 0.6, q = 0.6)

In this equilibrium:
- Expected payoff for Player 1 = 0.6×(5×0.6 + 0×0.4) + 0.4×(3×0.6 + 3×0.4)  
  = 0.6×(3) + 0.4×(3) = 1.8 + 1.2 = **3.0**

Alternatively, since both are playing mixed strategy with indifference, we can see that Player 1 gets 3 in expectation regardless — that's the value.

So without the contract, **your expected payoff in equilibrium is 3 points**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract says:
- If a player **chooses A0**, they receive an **additional 10 points**, **drawn equally from the other player**.
- If a player chooses A1, **no additional payments**.

> Important: The contract becomes active **only if both players sign**.

So if you sign and the other player signs, then:
- Whenever you play A0, you get +10, and Player 2 pays 10 (so loses 10).
- Whenever you play A1, nothing changes.
- Same for Player 2 if they play A0.

But crucially, **this affects the payoff matrix**.

---

### Step 3: Modify payoff matrix with contract (if both sign)

Now, if both players sign the contract, the new payoffs are:

|           | P2: A0 (with +10 to P2) | P2: A1 (no bonus) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **P1: A0 (+10)** | (5 + 10, 5 − 10) = (15, -5) | (0 + 10, 3 − 10) = (10, -7) |
| **P1: A1**            | (3, 0 + 10) = (3, 10)     | (3, 3)              |

Wait — correction: The contract says:
> "If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 points, **drawn equally from the other players**."

"Drawn equally from the other players" — meaning: **if you choose A0, you get +10, and your opponent loses 10 (since the 10 comes from them)**.

So the net transfer is: +10 to you, -10 to opponent.

Thus, the modified payoff matrix when both sign:

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | (5 + 10, 5 − 10) = (15, -5) | (0 + 10, 3 − 10) = (10, -7) |
| **P1: A1** | (3 − 10, 0 + 10) = (-7, 10) | (3, 3) |

Wait — this is asymmetric in how the bonuses are applied. We have to be careful.

Let’s clarify:

- **When a player chooses A0, they gain +10, and the other player loses 10.**
- So both players have the same rule: **anytime you play A0, +10 for you, −10 for opponent.**

So let’s recompute:

- If both play A0:
  - P1: 5 (base) + 10 (for A0) = 15
  - P2: 5 (base) + 10 (for A0) = 15 → wait, **no!**

Wait — here's the key ambiguity.

The contract says: **"drawn equally from the other players"**. That suggests the 10 points come from the other player — but if both choose A0, **both get +10**, but **who pays for both?**

Ah — this is critical.

If both players choose A0, and each gets +10 from the contract, where does this 10 come from?

It says: "drawn equally from the other players."

So if **you** play A0, you get +10, and **you** take it from the **other player**.

So if *both* play A0, then:

- P1 gets +10 from P2
- P2 gets +10 from P1

So net: each gets +10, and each loses +10 to the other → net effect: each gains 0? But that would mean **no net transfer**, but each gets +10 from the contract.

But how can both gain 10 from each other? That’s impossible.

This suggests the payment mechanism must be: **When a player chooses A0, they get +10, paid by the other player.**

So if the other player chose A1, then the other player pays 10.

But if the other player also chose A0, then the other player must also pay 10, **but they’re also receiving 10**.

So in a mutual A0:
- P1 receives +10 from P2
- P1 pays 10 to P2? No — the rule says: you get +10 when you play A0, and it's drawn from the other player.

So if **you** play A0, **you** get +10, **and the other player loses 10**.

Therefore, the payment is **unilateral**: you get +10, the other loses 10.

So if both play A0:
- P1 gets +10 (from P2) for playing A0
- P2 gets +10 (from P1) for playing A0
- So each gains +10

→ Net: both get +10, **no net transfer** — but the contract is funded by the other player.

Thus, the final payoffs when both play A0:

- P1: 5 (base) + 10 (contract) = 15
- P2: 5 (base) + 10 (contract) = 15

Wait — but how is this possible? The contract says "drawn equally from the other players" — but if both are taking from each other, it’s like a mutual gain.

But in reality, if both play A0, then:
- P1 gets +10 from P2
- P2 gets +10 from P1
So total money increases by 20? That doesn’t make sense unless the contract is a **global fund**.

Alternatively, maybe the contract is interpreted as:
> If a player chooses A0, they receive +10, paid by the **other player**.

So:
- If only P1 chooses A0: P1 gets +10, P2 loses 10
- If only P2 chooses A0: P2 gets +10, P1 loses 10
- If both A0: P1 gets +10 from P2, P2 gets +10 from P1 → net effect: both gain +10
- If both A1: no change

This is a **mutual gain** when both choose A0.

So the **contract effectively subsidizes A0 choices**, with the cost split when both are playing A0.

Let’s define the **final payoffs** under the contract (both sign):

|           | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0** | 5 + 10 = 15 (P1), 5 + 10 = 15 (P2) → (15, 15) | 0 + 10 = 10 (P1), 3 − 10 = −7 (P2) → (10, −7) |
| **P1: A1** | 3 − 10 = −7 (P1), 0 + 10 = 10 (P2) → (−7, 10) | 3, 3 → (3, 3) |

Yes — this is correct.

So the **new payoff matrix** when both sign the contract is:

|           | A0        | A1        |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**    | (15, 15)  | (10, -7)  |
| **A1**    | (-7, 10)  | (3, 3)    |

---

### Step 4: Analyze the new game (with contract, both sign)

Now we compute the Nash equilibrium of this new game.

Let p = P1's probability of A0  
q = P2's probability of A0

**Player 1's expected payoff:**

- If A0: 15q + 10(1−q) = 15q + 10 − 10q = 5q + 10
- If A1: −7q + 3(1−q) = −7q + 3 − 3q = −10q + 3

Set equal for indifference:
5q + 10 = −10q + 3  
15q = −7  
q = −7/15 → negative!

Impossible.

So Player 1 **never** plays A1 in equilibrium — because even if q=0, A0 gives 10, A1 gives 3 → A0 better.

Wait — let’s check:

- If q = 0 (P2 always plays A1):
  - P1 A0: 10
  - P1 A1: 3 → so A0 better

- If q = 1 (P2 always A0):
  - P1 A0: 15
  - P1 A1: -7 → so A0 better

So for **all q**, A0 gives strictly higher payoff than A1.

Therefore, Player 1 **will play A0 with probability 1**.

Similarly, from P2’s perspective:

- If P1 plays A0 (p=1):
  - P2 A0: 15
  - P2 A1: -7 → prefers A0

- If P1 plays A1 (p=0):
  - P2 A0: 10
  - P2 A1: 3 → prefers A0

So **regardless of P1’s choice, P2 prefers A0**.

Thus, **P2 will always play A0**.

So the **only Nash equilibrium** is: both play **A0** with probability 1.

Outcome: (15, 15)

So your **expected payoff under the contract (if both sign) is 15 points**.

---

### Step 5: Should you sign the contract?

But here's the catch: **the contract only becomes active if both players sign**.

Right now, you are deciding whether to sign **given** that the contract was proposed by Player 2 and approved via voting.

But you don't know whether the other player will sign — however, the problem says:

> "...you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it."

So you must decide whether to sign, knowing that if the other player doesn’t sign, the contract **doesn’t activate**, and you get **no benefit** and **no cost**.

But: **you have no information about Player 2’s decision**.

But crucially, **you can reason about what Player 2 will do**.

Player 2 proposed the contract — that suggests they expect to benefit from it.

But more importantly: **what will Player 2 do if you sign, and vice versa?**

We must consider **your decision to sign** under the assumption that the other player will act rationally.

---

Let’s suppose you **do not sign** the contract.

Then the contract is **not active**, regardless of what the other player does.

So the game is back to the original (no contract), and we already computed equilibrium: **both play mixed strategy, and your expected payoff is 3**.

Now, suppose you **do sign** the contract.

Then the contract **only becomes active if Player 2 also signs**.

So what will Player 2 do?

Let’s analyze Player 2’s incentives.

Suppose **you sign the contract**.

Then Player 2 must decide whether to sign or not.

Case 1: Player 2 signs → contract active → game becomes the one with payoffs (15,15) — so Player 2 gets 15.

Case 2: Player 2 does **not** sign → contract inactive → game reverts to original → equilibrium: both play mixed, Player 2 expected payoff = 3.

So if you sign, then:
- If Player 2 signs → you get 15
- If Player 2 does not sign → you get 3 (original game)

Now, **what will Player 2 do?**

- If Player 2 signs: gets 15
- If Player 2 does not sign: gets 3

So Player 2 will **sign**, because 15 > 3.

Therefore, if you sign, Player 2 will **also sign**.

Thus, if you sign, the contract **will** become active.

Then the outcome is (15, 15), so you get **15 points**.

But what if you **don’t sign**?

Then the contract does not activate (since both must sign).

So the game is original: Nash equilibrium with payoff 3 for you.

So you get 3.

Now compare:
- Sign contract: you get 15 (because Player 2 will also sign, due to incentives)
- Don’t sign: you get 3

So you **prefer to sign**.

---

### Step 6: Is there any risk?

Could Player 2 **not sign** even if it benefits them? Only if they are irrational or misinformed.

But we assume rational players.

Player 2, knowing that if they sign and you sign, they get 15 (vs 3 in no-contract), will sign.

And you, by signing, **induce** Player 2 to sign.

So signing is **strategically beneficial**.

Therefore, you should sign.

---

### Step 7: Final check

Is there any downside?

- If you sign, and Player 2 doesn’t, you get 3 (same as not signing).
- But Player 2 will **not** refuse, because they gain 15 vs 3.

So your payoff is **15** if you sign.

Whereas if you don’t sign, you get **3**.

So **you gain 12 points** by signing, and the risk is zero (since Player 2 has no reason not to sign).

Therefore, **signing is strictly better**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 2 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 2 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without the contract)**

This is a simultaneous-move game with two players and two actions: A0 and A1.

The base payoffs (before contract) are:

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Your Payoff | Opponent’s Payoff |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0               | 5           | 5                 |
| A0          | A1               | 0           | 3                 |
| A1          | A0               | 3           | 0                 |
| A1          | A1               | 3           | 3                 |

This is **not** a standard prisoner’s dilemma, but it does have some similar flavor — cooperation (A0 vs A0) gives high rewards, but there’s an incentive to deviate.

Let’s analyze whether there’s a dominant strategy or Nash equilibrium in the base game.

- If opponent plays A0:
  - Your payoff for A0: 5
  - Your payoff for A1: 3 → so you prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1:
  - Your payoff for A0: 0
  - Your payoff for A1: 3 → so you prefer A1

So no dominant strategy. This is like a coordination game **with a twist** — you prefer to match your opponent when they play A0 (you get 5 vs 3), but when they play A1, you prefer to play A1 as well (3 vs 0).

So, **the symmetric pure strategy Nash equilibria** are:
- (A0, A0): If you think the other plays A0, you should play A0 → payoff 5
- (A1, A1): If you think the other plays A1, you should play A1 → payoff 3

(A0, A1) and (A1, A0) are not equilibria because someone has incentive to deviate.

So pure strategy NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Now, what about mixed strategies?

Let’s suppose the opponent plays A0 with probability $ q $, A1 with $ 1 - q $.

Your expected payoff for playing A0:
- $ 5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q $

Your expected payoff for playing A1:
- $ 3q + 3(1 - q) = 3 $

Set equal to find indifference:
$ 5q = 3 \Rightarrow q = 0.6 $

So if opponent plays A0 with $ q = 0.6 $, you are indifferent.

Thus, **best response to opponent’s mixed strategy**: play A0 if $ q < 0.6 $, A1 if $ q > 0.6 $, indifferent if $ q = 0.6 $

Similarly, symmetry gives that for opponent, indifference when you play A0 with $ p = 0.6 $

So there’s a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** where both play A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4.

But now comes the **twist** — the contract.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the contract**

This contract was **proposed by Player 2** and approved via voting, so it applies to both players.

> - If a player chooses A0, they **receive +2 points**, drawn **equally from the other players**.
> - If a player chooses A1, they **pay -2 points**, distributed **equally among the other players**.

There are **two players**, so "other players" means just **one opponent**.

So:
- If you play A0: +2 points to you, and your opponent pays -2 (i.e., loses 2)
- If you play A1: -2 points to you, and your opponent gains +2

This is **symmetric** in effect: the contract creates a **transfer** from or to the opponent based on your choice.

Let’s now **update the payoffs** to include the contract.

---

### **Step 3: Adjust payoffs with contract**

Let’s compute the **total payoff** for you (Player 1) in each outcome, **including** the contract.

We need to consider both:
- Base payoff (from the original game)
- Contract adjustment (from your action choice)

Let’s build a full payoff table (Player 1's total payoff):

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment | Total Payoff |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| A0          | A0               | 5            | +2                   | **7**         |
| A0          | A1               | 0            | +2                   | **2**         |
| A1          | A0               | 3            | -2                   | **1**         |
| A1          | A1               | 3            | -2                   | **1**         |

Wait — is the contract applied **per action choice**, regardless of opponent?

Yes: "If a player chooses A0, they receive +2..." — so **yes**, it depends only on **your own action**, not opponent's.

So the contract adjustments are:
- A0 → +2 to you, -2 to opponent
- A1 → -2 to you, +2 to opponent

So the **total payoff for you** (Player 1) is:

- (A0, A0): 5 (base) + 2 (contract) = 7
- (A0, A1): 0 (base) + 2 (contract) = 2
- (A1, A0): 3 (base) - 2 (contract) = 1
- (A1, A1): 3 (base) - 2 (contract) = 1

So the **new payoff matrix** for Player 1 is:

|      | A0 (Opponent) | A1 (Opponent) |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **A0** | 7             | 2             |
| **A1** | 1             | 1             |

Note: This matrix is not symmetric — Player 1 is now heavily incentivized to play A0.

Let’s analyze **strategic incentives** now.

---

### **Step 4: Best response analysis under new payoffs**

Player 1 (you) wants to maximize your **total payoff**.

Let’s suppose opponent plays A0 with probability $ q $, A1 with $ 1 - q $.

Then your expected payoff:

- If you play A0: $ 7q + 2(1 - q) = 7q + 2 - 2q = 5q + 2 $
- If you play A1: $ 1q + 1(1 - q) = 1 $

Now compare:
- A0 is better than A1 if: $ 5q + 2 > 1 $
  → $ 5q > -1 $ → always true for $ q \geq 0 $

So: **A0 is strictly better than A1 for all $ q \in [0,1] $**

Even when $ q = 0 $ (opponent always plays A1):
- A0 gives: $ 5(0) + 2 = 2 $
- A1 gives: 1 → A0 is better

When $ q = 1 $ (opponent always A0): A0 gives 7, A1 gives 1 → A0 is much better.

So **A0 is a strictly dominant strategy** for Player 1 **under the contract**.

---

### **Step 5: Consider opponent’s incentives**

You are trying to maximize **your own** points.

Even though the opponent is rational too, they may not play A0 — but regardless, **no matter what they do**, playing A0 gives you **at least 2**, and playing A1 gives you only 1 (in all cases).

So **playing A0 is always best**, regardless of opponent's strategy.

Therefore, **your best strategy is to play A0 with probability 100%**.

But wait — could the opponent **also** be rational? Let’s check.

From opponent’s (Player 2) perspective, they face the same game **symmetrically**?

Let’s check Player 2’s payoffs under the contract.

Player 2’s total payoff:

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Base Payoff | Contract Adjustment | Total Payoff |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| A0          | A0               | 5            | +2                   | 7             |
| A0          | A1               | 3            | +2                   | 5             |
| A1          | A0               | 0            | -2                   | -2            |
| A1          | A1               | 3            | -2                   | 1             |

So Player 2’s payoff matrix:

|      | A0 (You) | A1 (You) |
|------|----------|----------|
| **A0** | 7        | 5        |
| **A1** | -2       | 1        |

So for Player 2:
- If you (Player 1) play A0: Player 2 gets 7 (A0), 5 (A1) → prefers A0
- If you play A1: Player 2 gets -2 (A0), 1 (A1) → prefers A1

So Player 2 has a **mixed best response**, but crucially: **Player 1 is not trying to guess or influence the other player** — you only care about **your own payoff**.

You know that **no matter what Player 2 does**, **playing A0 gives you 2 or more**, and playing A1 gives you **only 1**.

So for **you**, A0 is **strictly dominant**.

Therefore, **you should play A0 with probability 100%**, and **A1 with 0%**.

---

### **Step 6: Final check — what happens if you play A0 always?**

- With opponent playing A0: you get 7 points (5 base + 2 contract)
- With opponent playing A1: you get 2 points (0 base + 2 contract)

Even if opponent plays A1 with high probability, you still get 2, which is better than 1 from A1.

So yes, **A0 is always better**.

Also note: in the game with the contract, there is an **implicit incentive to cooperate (A0) because of the +2 bonus**, and the other player is penalized for choosing A1 (but you still get the bonus for A0).

No matter what the opponent does, A0 is better for you.

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

You should play A0 with **100% probability**, A1 with **0%**.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract can be put in place if the players agree to it via an approval voting process. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play.

Your task now is to review each proposed contract and decide which ones you approve of. The winning contract will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the contract designs that have been proposed:
Contract proposed by Player 1:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Contract proposed by Player 2:
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"C1": <true/false>, "C2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: contract identifiers (e.g., "C1", "C2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all contracts have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step, considering both the base game payoff structure and the potential impact of the two proposed contracts.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game Payoffs (Without Contracts)**

The game is a simultaneous move game with two players, and each chooses an action: A0 or A1.

The payoff matrix (for Player 1, since we are Player 1):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

We are Player 1.

Let’s analyze the best responses and Nash equilibria.

#### Best Responses for Player 1:
- If Player 2 plays A0: Player 1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best response: A0
- If Player 2 plays A1: Player 1 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best response: A1

So Player 1 has no dominant strategy.

#### Best Responses for Player 2:
- If Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best response: A0
- If Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → best response: A1

So Player 2 also has no dominant strategy.

#### Nash Equilibria:
We look for strategy pairs where neither player wants to deviate.

- (A0, A0): Player 1 gets 5, Player 2 gets 5.  
  - Player 1: if deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → won’t deviate  
  - Player 2: if deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → won’t deviate  
  ✅ (A0, A0) is a NE

- (A1, A1): Player 1 gets 3, Player 2 gets 3  
  - Player 1: if deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3 → won’t deviate  
  - Player 2: if deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3 → won’t deviate  
  ✅ (A1, A1) is a NE

- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 3  
  - Player 1: if deviates to A1, gets 3 > 0 → will deviate  
  ❌ Not a NE

- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3, Player 2 gets 0  
  - Player 2: if deviates to A1, gets 3 > 0 → will deviate  
  ❌ Not a NE

So we have two pure-strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

Now, in the absence of contracts, the outcome could be either of these. But (A0, A0) gives both players 5 points — which is the best for both.

However, (A1, A1) gives 3 each, which is worse for both.

But because both players have incentives to match the other’s choice, and there’s no coordination mechanism, it’s uncertain which equilibrium will be reached.

But **crucially**, the game has a **coordination problem**: if both players stick to A0, they get the highest payoff. But if one plays A0 and the other A1, the one playing A1 gains 3, but the one playing A0 gets nothing.

So mutual cooperation (A0, A0) is best, but there’s a temptation: if you think the opponent will play A0, you can get 5 by playing A0, but if you play A1, you get 3 — so not tempting. Wait: actually, playing A1 when opponent plays A0 gives you only 3, which is less than 5. So you have **no incentive to unilaterally deviate from A0 if the other plays A0**.

But **if you think the other will play A1**, then playing A1 gives you 3, which is better than 0 for playing A0. So you'll play A1.

So the risk is that both players end up in (A1, A1), which is inefficient.

So **(A0, A0) is the efficient outcome**, but (A1, A1) is also an equilibrium.

Now: **The contracts are meant to improve coordination or incentives**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contracts**

#### **C1: Contract proposed by Player 1**
- If a player chooses A0: no additional payment
- If a player chooses A1: no additional payment

→ So **this contract imposes no additional payments**. It’s equivalent to **no contract**.

So if approved, it has no effect on payoffs.

#### **C2: Contract proposed by Player 2**
- If a player chooses A0: no additional payment
- If a player chooses A1: they **pay an additional 1 point**, and this payment is **distributed equally among the other players**

→ So if you choose A1, you **lose 1 point** (as a personal cost), and that 1 point is **given to the other player**.

So this is a **penalty for choosing A1**, which is **shared with the other player**.

Note: "distributed equally among the other players" — since there are only 2 players, if you choose A1, you pay 1 point, and the other player gets that point.

So **net effect:**
- If you choose A1, you lose 1 point.
- The other player gains 1 point.

So this contract **penalizes playing A1**, and **subsidizes the other player** for your choice of A1.

Let’s now analyze how this changes the strategic incentives.

---

### **Step 3: How Do the Contracts Change the Game?**

We are Player 1.

We must approve or reject each contract.

The **winning contract** is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

We want to **maximize our total expected points**, so we want to choose the contract(s) that **best help us achieve the highest expected payoff**, considering that the final contract is chosen randomly among the most-approved ones.

Since the selection is **uniform at random** from those with **maximum approval**, we want to **influence the approval pattern strategically**, but we are only concerned with **our own payoff**.

So our goal is to choose approvals to maximize **our expected final payoff**.

Let’s evaluate each contract from our perspective (Player 1).

---

### **C1: Self-Proposed No-Contract (no change)**

- If accepted, no change to payoffs.
- This is just the original game with two pure NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

Our expected payoff depends on what we and the other player do.

But without coordination, we might end up in either equilibrium.

But in the absence of any contract, **we are stuck with the original game**.

So expected payoff: depends on how (A0, A0) vs (A1, A1) are selected.

But it’s uncertain.

We’ll come back to compute expected payoffs later.

But **no change** — so it's neutral.

---

### **C2: Contract proposed by Player 2 (Penalty for A1: pay 1, other gets it)**

Let’s re-express the **new payoff matrix under C2**, for Player 1.

Recall: if a player chooses A1, they **pay 1 point to the other player**.

So the net effect:
- When **you (P1)** choose A1, you **lose 1 point**.
- The **other player (P2)** gets +1 from your choice.

But this is **only applied when you choose A1**.

So we need to recompute the payoffs.

Let’s write the **new payoff matrix (for Player 1)** under C2.

|               | P2: A0       | P2: A1       |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5, 5)       | (0, 3 + 1) = (0, 4) |
| **P1: A1**    | (3 - 1, 0) = (2, 0) | (3 - 1, 3 + 1) = (2, 4) |

Wait — careful:

- When **P1 chooses A1**, he **pays 1 point**, so his own payoff is reduced by 1.
- When **P2 chooses A1**, he also pays 1 point, so P1 gains 1 point.

So:
- (A0, A0): P1 gets 5 (no penalty), P2 gets 5 → (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 (no penalty), P2 chooses A1 → P2 pays 1, so P1 gets +1 → P1 total = 0 + 1 = 1? Wait — **no!**

Wait — **crucial point**: The contract says: "If a player chooses A1, they pay 1 point, distributed to other players."

So **when P2 chooses A1**, P2 pays 1, and P1 receives it.

So P1’s payoff increases by 1 when P2 plays A1.

But **only if P2 plays A1**, P1 gains 1.

P1’s own action A0 or A1 doesn’t change this — **only when the other player plays A1** does P1 receive a gain.

But **when P1 plays A1**, **P1 pays 1**, regardless of what P2 does.

So the payoffs become:

- (P1: A0, P2: A0) →  
  P1: 5, P2: 5

- (P1: A0, P2: A1) →  
  P1: 0 (base) + 1 (because P2 played A1 and paid 1 to P1) = **1**  
  P2: 3 (base) - 1 (paying 1) = **2**

- (P1: A1, P2: A0) →  
  P1: 3 (base) - 1 (P1 paid 1) = **2**  
  P2: 0 (base) → **0**

- (P1: A1, P2: A1) →  
  P1: 3 - 1 = **2** (P1 paid 1)  
  P2: 3 - 1 = **2** (P2 paid 1)

So the new payoff matrix (for P1):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5      | 1      |
| **P1: A1**    | 2      | 2      |

Now analyze best responses for **P1** under C2:

- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → best: A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → best: A1

So still no dominant strategy.

Now P2’s best responses?

From P2’s perspective (P2 is the other player):

- (A0, A0): P2 gets 5 → if P2 plays A1, gets 2 → won’t deviate → stable
- (A0, A1): P2 gets 2 → if deviates to A0, gets 5? Wait — no: when P2 plays A1, P2 pays 1 → so gets only 2.

Wait — let’s write P2’s payoffs under C2:

- (P1: A0, P2: A0): P2 gets 5
- (P1: A0, P2: A1): P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2 (paid 1 himself)
- (P1: A1, P2: A0): P2 gets 0 → if deviates to A1, gets 2? No — in this case P2 is playing A0, P1 is A1.

Wait: when P1 plays A1, **P1 pays 1 point to P2**, so P2 gets +1 from P1’s A1.

Let’s compute P2’s payoffs under C2:

- (A0, A0): P2 gets 5
- (A0, A1): P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2 (paid 1 for playing A1)
- (A1, A0): P2 gets 0 + 1 = 1 (P1 played A1, so P2 gets 1)
- (A1, A1): P2 gets 3 - 1 = 2 (P2 played A1, so pays 1)

So P2’s payoff matrix:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5      | 2      |
| **P1: A1**    | 1      | 2      |

Now best responses for P2:

- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → best: A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → best: A1

So again, no dominant strategy.

Now look for Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): P1 gets 5, P2 gets 5  
  - P1: A0 → 5, A1 → 2 → won’t deviate  
  - P2: A0 → 5, A1 → 2 → won’t deviate  
  ✅ NE

- (A1, A1): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 2  
  - P1: if deviates to A0, gets 1 < 2 → won’t deviate  
  - P2: if deviates to A0, gets 1 < 2 → won’t deviate  
  ✅ NE

- (A0, A1): P1 gets 1, P2 gets 2  
  - P1: A0 → 1, A1 → 2 → will deviate to A1  
  ❌ not NE

- (A1, A0): P1 gets 2, P2 gets 1  
  - P2: A0 → 1, A1 → 2 → will deviate to A1  
  ❌ not NE

So two NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

But now, **which is better for us (P1)?**

- In (A0, A0): P1 gets 5
- In (A1, A1): P1 gets 2

So the **efficient outcome (A0, A0)** is still a NE, and **P1 gets 5**.

But is (A0, A0) still the more likely outcome?

Let’s think: in this new game, **does the contract make it more likely that both play A0?**

Yes, because now:

- If you think the other will play A0, you prefer A0 (5 vs 2) → strong incentive to cooperate
- If you think the other will play A1, you prefer A1 (2 vs 1) → but still, you get 2 vs only 1 if you stay on A0

But in the original game, if the other plays A1, you’d prefer A1 (3 vs 0), but now you get 2 vs 1 → so even less incentive to play A0.

But the **key insight**: under C2, (A0, A0) is still a NE, and **P1 gets 5** in it.

In all other outcomes, P1 gets only 1 or 2.

So (A0, A0) is the only outcome where P1 gets 5.

Now, **is (A0, A0) more likely now?**

Possibly yes.

Why? Because if **both players trust that the other will play A0**, both can coordinate on (A0, A0), and both are better off.

Moreover, **deviating is less attractive**.

For example, suppose P1 thinks P2 will play A0.

- Without contract: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → 5 > 3 → A0 better
- Under C2: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → 5 > 2 → even better incentive to play A0

If P1 thinks P2 will play A1:
- Original: P1 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1
- Under C2: P1 gets 1 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefers A1, but the gap is smaller (2 > 1)

So **the incentive to play A1 is reduced**, but not eliminated.

But **in the (A0, A0) equilibrium**, it is **stronger** than before.

Moreover, **now if both players play A0, they both get 5**, and **no one is worse off**.

But **if you play A1 while the other plays A0, you get 2 instead of 3** in the original — so worse.

So **the contract makes A1 less attractive** when the other plays A0, and **incentivizes cooperation**.

Even more: **now, if both play A1, P1 only gets 2**, whereas in original, they got 3. So both players are **worse off at (A1, A1)**.

So **both players have less incentive to coordinate on (A1, A1)**, but **more incentive to coordinate on (A0, A0)**.

So **C2 makes (A0, A0) more attractive and (A1, A1) less attractive**.

Therefore, **C2 improves coordination on the efficient outcome**.

Thus, if **C2 is adopted**, we **expect a higher chance of (A0, A0)**, so **higher expected payoff for us (P1)**.

Now compare to C1: which is **no change**.

So **C2 is better than C1** for us.

But we need to determine: **do we approve C2?**

Yes — because under C2, we **expect higher payoff**.

But wait: is there a risk?

Suppose only C2 is approved. Then the game becomes C2. Then both players are better off coordinating on A0.

But what if we **don’t approve C2**, but Player 2 does?

The contract is adopted only if both approve? No.

Wait: we have a **voting process**: each player **approves or rejects**.

Then the **winning contract** is selected uniformly at random **from those with maximum number of approvals**.

So **multiple contracts can be approved**, and the final one is one of the most-approved ones, chosen at random.

But we only have two contracts: C1 and C2.

We must vote on both.

Now: **C1 is proposed by us** (Player 1).

We **can choose to approve it**, and it doesn’t change anything.

We must decide whether to approve C2 (proposed by Player 2).

Let’s consider the **strategic consequences**.

#### If **we approve C2**, then:
- C2 has 1 approval (from us)
- C1 has 1 approval (from us, since we are Player 1, so we approve our own contract?)

Wait — **do we have to approve our own contract?** Not necessarily.

But **C1 is proposed by us**, so we can choose to reject it.

But why would we?

Let’s suppose we only approve C2.

Then:
- C1: approved by 0 (since we don't approve it)
- C2: approved by 1 (us)

Then maximum approvals = 1 → winning contract is C2 (chosen uniformly at random from those with 1 approval → only C2)

So the game becomes C2.

Our expected payoff: **higher** than without contract, because coordination on (A0, A0) is more likely.

Now, suppose we **approve C1 but not C2**.

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (us)
- C2: 0 approvals

Winning contract: C1 → no contract → original game.

Our expected payoff: could be higher or lower, but likely **lower** than under C2, because (A0, A0) may not be as likely.

Now, suppose we **approve both**.

Then:
- C1: 1 approval
- C2: 1 approval
- Both have maximum (1) → winning contract chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance of C1, 50% chance of C2

Then expected payoff for us:
= 0.5 × (payoff under C1) + 0.5 × (payoff under C2)

Now, under C1 (no contract): we expect to get **something between 0 and 5**, depending on coordination.

But **under C2**, we expect to get **closer to 5**, especially if coordination is good.

So the expected payoff under **C2 is higher**.

Therefore, **expected payoff under "both" is a weighted average, with some chance of C1** (which is worse), so **lower than if we only approve C2**.

Therefore, **best choice is to approve C2 only**, and **not approve C1**.

But wait — **C1 is proposed by us**, and we only get **1 approval** if we don’t approve it.

But **we can choose**.

Now, what if we **approve C1 but not C2**?

Then winning contract is C1 → no change → worse for us.

What if we **approve both**?

Then we get **50% chance of C1 and 50% chance of C2**, so **expected payoff: average of two**.

But **C2 is better**, so this is **worse** than fully committing to C2.

Therefore, **best for us is to reject C1 and approve C2**.

Then:
- C1: 0 approvals (we don't approve it)
- C2: 1 approval (we do)

So only C2 has 1 approval → winning contract is C2 with 100% probability.

We **get the benefit of C2**.

And **we get higher expected payoff**.

Now, is there any downside to approving C2?

Yes: **P2 gets a benefit too**.

- When P2 plays A1, he pays 1, but the other player (us) gets it.

But **we get to keep that money** when P2 plays A1.

But we are also penalized when we play A1.

But overall, **in the long run, if coordination improves**, both benefit.

But **we care only about our own points**.

And under C2, **we are more likely to get 5** in (A0, A0).

So **we are better off**.

But what if **P2 does not approve C2**?

Then:
- C2: 0 approvals
- C1: 1 approval (us)

Then winning contract is C1 → no contract → original game.

So **if we approve C2**, but P2 rejects it, then **C2 is not adopted**, and we get **C1**, which is worse.

So **we only get C2 if P2 also approves it**.

But we don’t know whether P2 will approve C2.

P2 may not want to approve C2.

Why?

Because **under C2**, when P2 plays A1, **he pays 1 point**, so he is worse off if he plays A1.

But he gains 1 when P1 plays A1.

But P2 is risk-averse or selfish?

We need to evaluate **whether P2 would approve C2**.

But we are **Player 1**, and we are making our own decision.

We are to decide **whether to approve C2**, based on **maximizing our expected payoff**, **considering that the final contract is selected from the approved ones**.

So **we can’t control P2’s vote**.

So we must consider **strategic interaction**.

Let’s suppose we approve C2.

Then:
- If P2 approves C2: then C2 has 2 approvals, C1 has 1 → max approvals = 2 → only C2 wins → we get C2 → good for us (higher payoff)
- If P2 rejects C2: then C2 has 1 approval (us), C1 has 1 (us) → both have 1 approval → max = 1 → winning contract chosen uniformly at random from those with 1 approval → so **either C1 or C2, each with 50% chance**

So **50% chance of C2** (good), **50% chance of C1** (neutral, but worse than C2)

So **expected payoff** if we approve C2:
= 0.5 × (payoff if P2 rejects C2) + 0.5 × (payoff if P2 approves C2)

But we don’t know if P2 will approve.

But we **can guess**.

Let’s analyze **P2’s approval incentive**.

For P2: should P2 approve C2?

Under C2:
- If P2 plays A1, he pays 1 point to P1 (us)
- But if P1 plays A1, P2 gets 1 point

But from **P2’s perspective**, the **overall expected payoff** under C2 depends on how both play.

But P2 wants to maximize his own payoff.

In the **original game**, P2 has two NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

In (A0, A0): P2 gets 5
In (A1, A1): P2 gets 3

But under C2:
- (A0, A0): P2 gets 5
- (A1, A1): P2 gets 2 (since he pays 1)

So **P2’s payoff in (A1, A1) drops from 3 to 2**

So P2 is worse off in that equilibrium.

But (A0, A0) is still a NE and gives 5.

So P2, like P1, **has more incentive to coordinate on (A0, A0)**.

So **P2 also benefits from C2**, because it makes (A0, A0) more attractive and (A1, A1) less attractive.

So **P2 should also want to approve C2**, because it helps him coordinate on the better outcome.

Moreover, **if both approve C2**, then the contract is adopted, and P2 can expect higher payoff.

But **P2 is rational** — he will likely **approve C2**, because it **helps him**.

Therefore, **reasonable to assume** that **P2 will approve C2**.

Thus, if **we approve C2**, then **P2 also approves**, so C2 has 2 approvals → it wins for sure → we get C2 → good.

Now, suppose we **don’t approve C2**, but approve C1.

Then:
- C1: 1 approval (us)
- C2: 0 approvals
- So C1 wins → no contract → original game

Then, in original game, (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are both NE.

If both players are rational, they might play (A0, A0), but it’s not guaranteed.

But in C2, **the chance of (A0, A0) is higher**, so **payoff is higher**.

So **we are better off with C2**.

Therefore, **we should approve C2**.

Now, **what about C1?**

If we approve C1 and C2, then:
- C1: 1
- C2: 2 (if P2 approves) → so C2 wins → good

But if we don’t approve C1, and C2 is approved, C2 still wins.

But if we approve C1, **we increase the chance that C1 is selected**, but only if C2 is not approved.

But since we expect P2 to approve C2, C2 will win anyway.

So **approving C1 is unnecessary** — it only dilutes our strategy.

In fact, if we approve both, and C2 is approved by P2, then **C2 wins anyway**, but **we are not getting extra benefit**.

So **best strategy: approve C2, reject C1**.

Then:
- C2: 1 approval (us + P2)
- C1: 0 approvals
- C2 wins → game under C2

We get the beneficial contract.

Therefore, **approval choice**:

- C1: **Reject** → false
- C2: **Approve** → true

Even though C1 is proposed by us, we **can reject it** for strategic reasons.

And **it increases our expected payoff**.

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

Approve C2 (because it improves coordination toward (A0, A0), which is best for us), reject C1 (because it does nothing and risks diluting the outcome).

Thus:

{"C1": false, "C2": true}

response:
Let's analyze this step by step, considering both the original game and the proposed contract.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without the contract)

We have a 2-player game with action choices: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 → row, Player 2 → column):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

This is a variant of a coordination game with a twist:  
- If both play A0: high payoff (5,5) → best for both  
- If one plays A0 and the other A1: the A1 player gets 3, the A0 player gets 0 → so playing A1 is better when the other plays A0  
- If both play A1: both get 3 → not as good as (5,5), but better than getting 0

This resembles a **stag hunt** game.

Now, we need to consider if there's a Nash equilibrium.

- (A0, A0): is it stable? If Player 1 deviates to A1 while Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 gets 3 < 5 → no incentive → stable  
- (A1, A1): If Player 1 deviates to A0 while Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 0 < 3 → no incentive → stable  
- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0, but could deviate to A1 and get 3 → unstable  
- (A1, A0): Player 1 gets 3, but could deviate to A0 and get 5 → unstable

So there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

But the risk of coordination failure exists: if there's uncertainty about the other player's action, choosing A0 is risky (if opponent plays A1, you get 0), while A1 gives you 3 regardless (since if opponent plays A0, you get 3; if A1, you get 3).

So in a symmetric situation, rational players might fear getting 0 and choose A1 → end up at (A1, A1) with lower payoff than (A0, A0).

---

### Step 2: Understand the contract

The contract is proposed and chosen via approval voting by Player 2. It states:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point, **drawn equally from the other players.**  
> - If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point, **distributed equally among the other players.**

Since there are only two players, “drawn equally from the other players” means:
- If you play A0 → get +1 point, and the other player loses 1 point
- If you play A1 → pay -1 point (lose 1 point), and the other player gains 1 point

So **the contract is a transfer from one player to the other based on choice**, and it’s symmetric:  
- A0 → +1 (to self), -1 (to other)  
- A1 → -1 (to self), +1 (to other)

Thus, **this contract creates a direct transfer between players based on action choice.**

Let’s update the payoff matrix **with the contract in effect**, assuming both players sign it.

Important: **The contract only applies if both sign it.** We are deciding whether **we (Player 1)** should sign it.

But we can only gain from the contract if the other player also signs.

Since the contract is selected via approval voting by Player 2, **we assume Player 2 has approved it.** So we are deciding whether to accept it.

So: we must decide whether to sign → the contract takes effect → both players are bound by it.

---

### Step 3: Compute new payoffs with the contract

We now modify the original payoffs by **adding the contract adjustment**.

The contract adjustments are:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → +1
- If Player 1 plays A1 → -1
- If Player 2 plays A0 → +1 (to themselves, -1 from Player 1)
- If Player 2 plays A1 → -1 (to themselves, +1 from Player 1)

So for each cell, we add:
- For Player 1: +1 if A0, -1 if A1
- For Player 2: +1 if A0, -1 if A1

Let’s recompute the full payoffs (Player 1, Player 2):

#### Case 1: (A0, A0)
- Original: (5, 5)
- Contract: P1 plays A0 → +1, P2 plays A0 → +1
- New: (6, 6)

#### Case 2: (A0, A1)
- Original: (0, 3)
- Contract: P1 plays A0 → +1, P2 plays A1 → -1
- New: (0+1, 3-1) = (1, 2)

#### Case 3: (A1, A0)
- Original: (3, 0)
- Contract: P1 plays A1 → -1, P2 plays A0 → +1
- New: (3-1, 0+1) = (2, 1)

#### Case 4: (A1, A1)
- Original: (3, 3)
- Contract: P1 plays A1 → -1, P2 plays A1 → -1
- New: (2, 2)

So the new payoff matrix is:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (6,6)  | (1,2)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (2,1)  | (2,2)  |

---

### Step 4: Analyze the new game (with contract)

Now, let’s find the Nash equilibria in this new game.

#### Check (A0, A0): (6,6)
- If P1 deviates to A1: gets 2 < 6 → no incentive
- If P2 deviates to A1: gets 2 < 6 → no incentive
→ **Nash equilibrium**

#### Check (A1, A1): (2,2)
- If P1 deviates to A0: gets 1 < 2 → no incentive
- If P2 deviates to A0: gets 1 < 2 → no incentive
→ **Nash equilibrium**

#### Check (A0, A1): (1,2)
- P1: A0 → gets 1; if switch to A1 → gets 2 > 1 → **incentive to deviate** → not NE

#### Check (A1, A0): (2,1)
- P2: A0 → gets 1; if switch to A1 → gets 2 > 1 → **incentive to deviate** → not NE

So two pure-strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

But now, (A0, A0) gives **6,6** — much better than (2,2)

So the game has been **restructured to make (A0, A0) more attractive** in the sense that it's the highest payoff equilibrium.

Moreover, let's consider **the incentives to play A0**.

From Player 1’s perspective:
- If Player 2 plays A0 → P1 gets: 6 (if A0), 2 (if A1) → so A0 is better
- If Player 2 plays A1 → P1 gets: 1 (if A0), 2 (if A1) → so A1 is better

So P1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0 → choose A0
- If P2 plays A1 → choose A1

Similarly for P2:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 6 (if A0), 2 (if A1) → so A0 better
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets 1 (if A0), 2 (if A1) → so A1 better

So the best response structure is symmetric: each player wants to match the other.

So (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are the only consistent equilibria.

But the **key point** is: **in the original game, both could end up at (A1, A1) due to coordination risk. The contract makes (A0, A0) more attractive and gives it higher payoff (6,6 vs 3,3), and also the penalty for choosing A1 is now stronger (you lose 1 point).**

Moreover, the **incentive to coordinate on A0 is now stronger**, because the gain is high.

But — we must ask: **Should we sign the contract?**

We are Player 1. The contract only takes effect if both players sign. Player 2 has approved it (via approval voting), so **we are deciding whether to sign**.

If we **don’t sign**, the contract does not apply → original game applies → we play without contract.

If we **do sign**, then contract applies → new game with new payoffs.

So we must compare:
- Expected payoff **if we sign** and both play optimally (e.g., equilibrium)
- Expected payoff **if we don’t sign**

But note: we can't force the other player to play any particular strategy. We must consider best responses.

Let’s consider what happens in each scenario.

---

### Case A: We **do not sign** the contract

Then we play the original game.

As discussed, two equilibria: (A0, A0) → (5,5), (A1, A1) → (3,3)

If both players are rational and coordinate, they might aim for (A0, A0). But there's a risk: if one player fears the other will play A1, they may choose A1.

But suppose both players are symmetric and rational. They may anticipate that the other will play A0 if they believe the other will too.

But because (A0, A0) is risk-dominant or payoff-dominant (better payoffs), many models suggest rational players should aim for it.

But there’s a **coordination failure risk**: if one plays A0 and the other A1, you get only 0 — a big loss.

So rational players might choose **A1** as a safe strategy → end up with 3 points.

So **in the absence of a contract**, the **safe equilibrium is (A1, A1)** → 3 points for both.

But if communication is allowed or trust is present, (A0, A0) is better.

But **in a one-shot game**, without communication, players may fail to coordinate, especially since the risk of getting 0 is high.

So the **expected payoff in the original game** is uncertain — but **if we assume players avoid risk and play the risk-dominant equilibrium**, they might both play A1 → 3 points.

Alternatively, they might both play A0 → 5 points.

But without a way to coordinate, it's ambiguous.

However, **with the contract**, the game is changed so that (A0, A0) becomes strictly more attractive.

Now, let’s look at **our payoff if we sign the contract**.

But note: the contract makes A0 **more valuable** (you get +1 extra if you play A0), and A1 **less valuable** (you lose 1 point).

So **the relative advantage of A0 increases**.

In the contract version:
- If both players play A0 → we get 6 (vs 5 without contract)
- If both play A1 → we get 2 (vs 3 without contract) → worse
- But if we play A0 and other plays A1 → we get 1 (vs 0) — better
- If we play A1 and other plays A0 → we get 2 (vs 3) — worse

So the **net effect** is:
- A0 is more attractive (gain from high coordination)
- A1 is less attractive (loss from coordination failure)

Moreover, **playing A0 is safer in the sense that even if the other plays A1, you get 1 point instead of 0** — that’s better than 0.

Whereas if you play A1 and other plays A0, you get 2 vs 3 — worse.

But the **symmetry is broken**: the risk of getting 0 is gone — minimum you get is 1 (if you play A0 and other plays A1).

But the **best outcome is now 6**, and the worst is **1** (if you play A0 and other plays A1).

Without contract, worst is **0**.

So **the contract improves the worst-case payoff when playing A0**, and improves the best-case payoff from 5 to 6.

But what happens to coordination?

In the contract version, if both players expect the other to play A0, then playing A0 gives 6 — very good.

If both expect A1, then they both get 2 — worse than 3.

But **since the outcome (A0, A0) gives higher payoff (6 vs 5)**, and the **risk of getting 0 is eliminated**, rational players might be more likely to coordinate on A0.

In fact, **the unique efficient equilibrium is now (A0, A0)**, and it is **strictly Pareto superior**.

Moreover, the **incentive to deviate from A0 is weaker** if the other is playing A0 (you get 6, vs 2 if you switch to A1).

Similarly for the other player.

So the contract **makes (A0, A0) a stronger attractor**.

Even if both players are risk-averse, **the contract removes the worst-case scenario of getting 0** when playing A0.

That’s a huge improvement.

Now, if we **don’t sign the contract**, we risk getting 0 if the other plays A1.

With the contract, **minimum we get is 1** if we play A0, and only 2 if we play A1 and other plays A0.

So playing A0 becomes **less risky**.

Moreover, **the expected payoff under rational coordination is higher** with the contract.

But can we assume coordination?

In the absence of communication, players must choose strategies based on incentives and expectations.

But the **contract changes the structure** — it gives us an incentive to **want and expect** A0.

In the contract version:
- Player 1’s expected payoff depends on belief about Player 2.
- Suppose Player 1 believes Player 2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with 1-q.

Then:
- If P1 plays A0: get 6*q + 1*(1-q) = 6q + 1 - q = 5q + 1
- If P1 plays A1: get 2*q + 2*(1-q) = 2q + 2 - 2q = 2

So:
- Play A0 if 5q + 1 > 2 → 5q > 1 → q > 0.2

So for any belief that P2 plays A0 with probability > 20%, P1 prefers A0.

Similarly, for P2.

So even if we believe the other player plays A0 only 20% of the time, we still prefer A0.

So **A0 is a dominant strategy if we believe the other plays A0 with probability > 0.2**, which is **very low**.

In contrast, in the original game:
- Play A0: 5q + 0*(1-q) = 5q
- Play A1: 3q + 3*(1-q) = 3

So A0 is better if 5q > 3 → q > 0.6

So in original game, we need **belief > 60%** that other plays A0 to prefer A0.

But **in the contract game, only need belief > 20%**.

So the **contract significantly reduces the threshold for choosing A0**.

Thus, **the contract makes A0 a more natural choice even under weak belief in coordination**.

Therefore, **the contract makes it more likely that both players will coordinate on A0**, increasing the chance of getting 6 points.

Even if they don’t coordinate perfectly, the **worst-case payoff is better** (1 instead of 0), and the **incentive to do A0 is stronger**.

---

### Final Decision: Should we sign the contract?

Let’s compare:

- **Without contract**:  
  - If we expect the other to play A0 (say with 60% prob), we should play A0 → get 5*0.6 + 0*0.4 = 3.0  
  - But if we’re risk-averse, we may play A1 → guaranteed 3  
  - So **expected payoff around 3 or 5**, depending on coordination

- **With contract**:  
  - Even if we believe P2 plays A0 with 20% prob → we should play A0 (best response)  
  - Expected payoff: 5*(0.2) + 1*(0.8) = 1 + 0.8 = 1.8? Wait — that’s for playing A0  
    But actually, since both players will act similarly, **if both have same incentives**, they will likely coordinate on A0  
    → **we can expect (A0,A0)** with high probability  
    → **we get 6 points**

Moreover, even in worst case, we get **1 point** (if other plays A1), which is better than 0.

And the gain from coordinating on A0 is now higher.

So the **contract increases the expected payoff** in all scenarios, **especially the high-payoff scenario**.

And it **reduces risk** of getting very low payoff.

Therefore, **signing the contract is beneficial**.

---

### Conclusion:

Yes, we should sign the contract.

It improves coordination incentives, raises the payoff for mutual A0, eliminates the possibility of getting 0, and makes A0 a better response even under modest belief in cooperation.

Thus, our total expected points are likely to increase.

agent: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507(CoT)#P1
response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game without any contract

The game is a simultaneous-move game between two players (Player 1 and Player 2), with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|           | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

So:
- If both play A0: (5,5) → mutually beneficial
- If you play A0, opponent plays A1: you get 0, they get 3 → bad for you
- If you play A1, opponent plays A0: you get 3, they get 0 → you're slightly better off
- If both play A1: (3,3) → both get 3, which is worse than (5,5) but better than getting 0

We are Player 1.

---

### Step 2: Analyze strategic incentives

This is similar to a coordination game with a dominant equilibrium, but let’s look closely.

- Is there a dominant strategy for Player 1?
  - If Player 2 plays A0:
    - A0 → 5
    - A1 → 3 → so A0 is better
  - If Player 2 plays A1:
    - A0 → 0
    - A1 → 3 → so A1 is better

So Player 1 has **no dominant strategy**. It depends on what the other player does.

But notice: (A0, A0) is Pareto-efficient (5,5), and (A1, A1) gives (3,3). So both prefer (A0, A0) if they can coordinate.

However, there’s a risk: if I play A0 and the other plays A1, I get 0 — very bad.

So trust and coordination matter.

---

### Step 3: Consider the proposed contract

> Contract proposal:
> - If a player chooses A0 → no additional payment
> - If a player chooses A1 → no additional payment

So **the contract adds zero extra payments, regardless of action**.

In other words: **The contract has no effect on payoffs.**

It does not change the reward structure. It does not penalize or reward actions.

This is equivalent to saying: "We agree to nothing."

---

### Step 4: What does signing the contract do?

The contract becomes active **only if all players sign it**.

You are the one deciding whether to sign.

But the contract does **nothing** — no change in payoffs, no enforcement, no side payments.

So signing it has **no benefit** to you.

But does signing it have any cost?

- Only if the contract has consequences, but here it doesn’t. It's inert.

However, you must consider: **what if the other player sees that you signed, and then they are more likely to play A0?**

But wait: **you are the proposer of the contract.** The contract is proposed by Player 1 (you), and is subject to approval voting by both players.

The contract says **nothing changes**. So it’s effectively irrelevant.

Even if you sign and the other player signs, nothing changes.

But now: could signing the contract **help coordinate on (A0, A0)**?

Only if the contract **changes incentives** — but it doesn’t.

So signing just signals willingness to cooperate, but without changing payoffs.

But since the contract has **no effect**, its only role is signaling.

However, **you are trying to maximize your own points**.

So ask: **Does signing this contract increase your expected payoff?**

Answer: **No**, because the contract doesn’t change the game.

Moreover, since the contract is fully inert, signing it gives you no advantage.

But — is there any **risk** in signing?

Only if not signing could be a better signal — but since the contract has no effect, **signing it is costless**.

However, here's a critical point: **If you sign, but the other player doesn’t, the contract doesn’t activate**.

But in this scenario, you are deciding whether to sign or not.

But the **payoffs only depend on the actions taken**, not on the signing, **unless the contract is active**.

And the contract is only active if **both sign**.

So:

- If you sign and the other doesn’t → contract inactive → same as no contract
- If you sign and the other signs → contract active → but it does nothing → same payoffs
- If you don’t sign → contract can't activate (even if they sign)

So regardless of whether you sign, the **contract cannot change outcomes**.

Thus, **there is no difference in expected payoff** based on signing.

So the decision is costless — but you must choose.

Now: **Is there any reason to sign?**

Only if it **helps coordinate on A0**.

But since the contract doesn’t add any penalty or reward, **it doesn’t change incentives**.

Example: Suppose you think the other player is going to play A0. Then you prefer A0 (5 > 3).

But if you think they’ll play A1, you prefer A1 (3 > 0).

So your decision depends on beliefs, **not** on the contract.

The contract doesn’t change any of that.

Therefore, **signing the contract has no effect on your strategy or expected payoff**.

So, you can choose freely.

But your goal is to **maximize your points**.

Since signing has **no benefit and no cost**, and you must pick one, you should pick the option that doesn’t hurt.

But both choices are neutral.

However — there’s a subtle issue: **what if signing the contract signals commitment**, and the other player then plays A0, and you end up playing A0?

But again, the contract doesn’t enforce anything. It just says “nothing happens”.

So if you sign, but the other player doesn’t, it’s inactive.

If you don’t sign, they might still play A0.

In short: **no strategic effect**.

Thus, **signing the contract does not increase your expected payoff**.

Therefore, despite being costless, **you should not sign** — not because it hurts, but because there’s **no reason to sign**.

But wait: what if by signing, you increase the chance the other player signs?

But the other player will likely only sign if it helps them — and since it doesn't help them either (same reason), they have **no incentive** to sign.

So the probability of the contract activating is unchanged by your decision.

Thus, your signing does not affect the game.

---

### Final Decision

The contract is inert — no effect on payoffs, no change in incentives, no coordination power.

So signing it provides **no benefit** and **zero cost**.

But you are not forced to sign.

Since your goal is to maximize points, and signing doesn't help, and it’s not required, you should **not sign**, unless there’s a benefit.

But there is none.

Therefore, the optimal decision is:

> **Do not sign the contract.**

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, there is a payment contract in place because every player signed it in beforehand. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 10 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Since this contract directly affects your final payoff, consider the contract when making your strategy decisions!


Instruction:

- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Payoff Matrix (without the contract)**

We are Player 1. The other player is Player 2.

The base payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                        | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| **A1**                        | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

So:
- If both play A0: both get 5
- If you play A0, opponent plays A1: you get 0, opponent gets 3
- If you play A1, opponent plays A0: you get 3, opponent gets 0
- If both play A1: both get 3

This is a **coordination game** with a preference for A0, but with a risk of getting 0 if you play A0 and opponent plays A1.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Payment Contract**

This contract was proposed by Player 2 and passed via approval voting. It says:

> - If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional **+10 points**, drawn **equally from the other player**.
> - If a player chooses A1, no additional payments.

So, **whenever a player chooses A0, they gain +10 points, and the other player loses 10 points**.

> **Important**: This is not a fixed subsidy. It's **conditional on the action chosen**. So:
- If **you** choose A0 → **you gain +10**, **opponent loses -10**
- If **opponent** chooses A0 → **opponent gains +10**, **you lose -10**

So the **total effect** of choosing A0 is:
- You get +10 (from contract)
- But the base payoff is as per the matrix
- So your **total payoff = base payoff + 10 if you chose A0**, and opponent gets **base payoff - 10 if you chose A0**

---

### **Step 3: Update the Payoff Matrix to Include the Contract**

Let’s now compute **your total payoff** based on both your action and the opponent’s, **including the contract effect**.

Recall: You only gain +10 **if you choose A0**, and opponent loses 10 in that case.

So:

#### Case 1: You A0, Opponent A0
- Base: (5, 5)
- You gain +10 (you picked A0), opponent loses -10 (you picked A0)
- Your total: 5 + 10 = **15**
- Opponent: 5 - 10 = **-5**

#### Case 2: You A0, Opponent A1
- Base: (0, 3)
- You gain +10 (you picked A0), opponent loses -10 (you picked A0)
- Your total: 0 + 10 = **10**
- Opponent: 3 - 10 = **-7**

#### Case 3: You A1, Opponent A0
- Base: (3, 0)
- You **did not** pick A0 → no +10
- But opponent picked A0 → opponent gets +10, you lose -10
- Your total: 3 - 10 = **-7**
- Opponent: 0 + 10 = **10**

#### Case 4: You A1, Opponent A1
- Base: (3, 3)
- Neither picked A0 → no contract payments
- Your total: 3
- Opponent: 3

Now let’s write the **updated payoff matrix** (your payoff):

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0       | A1       |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**                        | 15       | 10       |
| **A1**                        | -7       | 3        |

---

### **Step 4: Analyze your best response**

You are trying to **maximize your expected payoff**.

Let’s suppose Player 2 chooses A0 with probability **q**, and A1 with probability **1 - q**.

Your expected payoff for each of your actions:

- E[A0] = q×15 + (1 - q)×10 = 15q + 10 - 10q = **5q + 10**
- E[A1] = q×(-7) + (1 - q)×3 = -7q + 3 - 3q = **-10q + 3**

Now compare:
You should play A0 when:
> 5q + 10 > -10q + 3  
> 5q + 10q > 3 - 10  
> 15q > -7  
> q > -7/15 → always true since q ≥ 0

So **5q + 10 > -10q + 3 for all q ≥ 0**

Wait, let's check: is E[A0] > E[A1] for all q?

Set:
5q + 10 > -10q + 3  
15q > -7 → always true

But is that *really* true?

Let’s plug in q=0 (opponent never plays A0):
- E[A0] = 10
- E[A1] = 3 → A0 better

q=1 (opponent always plays A0):
- E[A0] = 15
- E[A1] = -7 → A0 better

Even at q=0, A0 is better (10 vs 3)

So **A0 is strictly better than A1 for all q**

That means: **no matter what the opponent does, playing A0 gives you a higher expected payoff than A1**

Thus, your **dominant strategy** is **A0**.

Wait! Is this really correct? Let’s double-check.

Yes: the contract gives you +10 **whenever you play A0**, regardless of opponent. And since your payoff under A0 is always at least 10, while under A1 it goes down to -7 if opponent plays A0, and even at 3 when both play A1, clearly A0 is always better.

In fact, the minimal payoff for A0 is 10 (if opponent plays A1), and the maximal payoff for A1 is 3 (if opponent also plays A1). So A0 dominates A1.

Thus, rational self-interested Player 1 should always play A0.

But wait — let's consider the **opponent’s incentives**, since they are also rational and may react.

But the instruction is: **you are maximizing your own total points**, so you can assume the opponent is rational but you are not required to predict their exact strategy — you can just choose your best response.

But since A0 dominates A1 **for you**, regardless of opponent’s strategy, then **playing A0 with probability 100% is your optimal strategy**.

But let’s confirm: is there **any** reason to mix?

Suppose you play A0 with probability 100%, A1 with 0%.

Then opponent knows you always play A0 → opponent’s best response?

Let’s look at opponent’s incentives.

We should check: **what is the opponent’s best response?**

Let’s compute opponent’s payoffs under your strategy (you play A0 with probability 1).

Opponent’s payoffs:

- If opponent plays A0: base = 5, and since **you** played A0 → **opponent loses 10** → total = 5 - 10 = -5
- If opponent plays A1: base = 3, and **you** played A0 → **opponent loses 10** → total = 3 - 10 = -7

So opponent gets -5 if A0, -7 if A1 → so opponent prefers A0.

But both give negative payoffs, so opponent will still play A0.

So if you play A0 always, opponent plays A0 always → you get 15 (from earlier)

Alternatively, suppose you mixed.

But since A0 gives higher expected payoff regardless, no reason to mix.

Is there **any** chance that playing A1 could help?

Suppose: you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get -7 (bad)
You play A1, opponent plays A1 → you get 3 (better than -7, but still worse than 10 or 15)

So maximum you can get from A1 is 3, but from A0 you **always** get at least 10.

So **no rational justification to ever play A1**.

Therefore, **optimal strategy for you is to play A0 with 100% probability**.

---

### **Step 5: Final Answer**

You must output a JSON object with probabilities summing to 100.

Since A0 is strictly optimal, you should choose:

```
{"A0": 100, "A1": 0}
```

---

response:
To determine the optimal strategy in this decision-making game, let's analyze the payoff of each possible action combination first and then incorporate the contract details.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Original Payoffs:**
    - If both players choose A0 (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 5 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1 (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 0 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0 (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 3 points.
    - If both players choose A1 (A1, A1): Player 2 gets 3 points.

2. **Impact of the Payment Contract:**
    - If Player 2 (you) chooses A0, you receive an additional 1 point, and Player 1 loses 1 point.
    - If Player 2 (you) chooses A1, you lose 1 point, and Player 1 receives 1 point.

3. **New Payoffs with Contract:**
    - If both players choose A0 (A0, A0): Player 2 gets (5 + 1) = 6 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1 (A0, A1): Player 2 gets (0 - 1) = -1 point.
    - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0 (A1, A0): Player 2 gets (3 + 1) = 4 points.
    - If both players choose A1 (A1, A1): Player 2 gets (3 - 1) = 2 points.

The adjusted payoffs for Player 2 are:
- A0, A0: 6 points.
- A0, A1: -1 point.
- A1, A0: 4 points.
- A1, A1: 2 points.

### Strategic Decision:

The goal should be to maximize the expected payoff.

To calculate the expected value for each action, we need to consider mixed strategies. Let's denote:
- \(p\) as the probability that Player 2 chooses A0.
- \(1 - p\) as the probability that Player 2 chooses A1.

Let's assume that Player 1 might also use a mixed strategy. Let \(q\) be the probability that Player 1 chooses A0.

Expected payoff for Player 2 (you) when choosing each action based on Player 1's mixed strategy:
- Expected payoff for choosing A0: \(6q + 4(1 - q) = 6q + 4 - 4q = 2q + 4\)
- Expected payoff for choosing A1: \(-1q + 2(1 - q) = -q + 2 - 2q = 2 - 3q\)

To find an equilibrium, we need to make these expectations equal. This means solving:
\[2q + 4 = 2 - 3q\]
\[5q = -2\]
\[q = -\frac{2}{5}\]

Since a probability cannot be negative, we need to explore pure strategies or default to a strategy that covers expected outcomes best.

### Conclusion:
A reasonable strategy without clear insight into Player 1's behavior (since \(q\) has unrealistic results) would be a 50-50 split. This balances the possible payoffs:

```json
{"A0": 50, "A1": 50}
```

This mixed strategy neither overly favors A0 nor A1, balancing the potential payoffs considering the penalty or reward adjustments.

response:
Let's analyze this decision-making game step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

We are Player 1. The game is simultaneous, with actions A0 and A1. The payoff matrix is as follows:

|          | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

So:
- If both play A0 → 5 points each.
- If Player 1 plays A0, Player 2 plays A1 → Player 1 gets 0, Player 2 gets 3.
- If Player 1 plays A1, Player 2 plays A0 → Player 1 gets 3, Player 2 gets 0.
- If both play A1 → 3 points each.

---

### Step 2: Consider the Contract and Its Status

A contract was proposed by Player 1, but **both Player 1 and Player 2 rejected it**. Therefore, the contract is **not active** and **does not affect the payoffs**.

The contract was:
- If you choose A0 → no additional payments.
- If you choose A1 → no additional payments.

So effectively, it didn't change anything — it was a "no-penalty, no-bonus" contract for either action. Since both players rejected it, we ignore it entirely.

We are playing the **base game only**, no modifications.

---

### Step 3: Find the Best Strategy (Nash Equilibrium)

We need to find the optimal mixed strategy for Player 1 to **maximize our expected points**, assuming the other player is also rational and will play optimally.

Let’s denote:
- Let $ p $ = probability that Player 1 chooses A0.
- Then $ 1 - p $ = probability Player 1 chooses A1.

Let $ q $ = probability that Player 2 chooses A0.
- Then $ 1 - q $ = probability Player 2 chooses A1.

We want to compute Player 1’s expected payoff as a function of $ p $ and $ q $:

$$
E_1 = p \cdot q \cdot 5 + p \cdot (1 - q) \cdot 0 + (1 - p) \cdot q \cdot 3 + (1 - p) \cdot (1 - q) \cdot 3
$$

Simplify:
$$
E_1 = 5pq + 0 + 3(1 - p)q + 3(1 - p)(1 - q)
$$

Expand:
$$
E_1 = 5pq + 3q - 3pq + 3(1 - p - q + pq)
$$
$$
= 5pq + 3q - 3pq + 3 - 3p - 3q + 3pq
$$
$$
= (5pq - 3pq + 3pq) + (3q - 3q) + 3 - 3p
$$
$$
= 5pq + 0 + 3 - 3p
$$

Wait, double-check that arithmetic:
- From above: 5pq from first term.
- Then 3q - 3pq from second term.
- Then 3(1 - p)(1 - q) = 3(1 - p - q + pq) = 3 - 3p - 3q + 3pq

Now add all:
- pq terms: 5pq - 3pq + 3pq = 5pq
- q terms: 3q - 3q = 0
- Constants: 3
- p terms: -3p
- So:
$$
E_1 = 5pq - 3p + 3
$$

Yes.

So:
$$
E_1 = 5pq - 3p + 3
$$

Now, we want to find a strategy for Player 1 (i.e., value of $ p $) that maximizes expected payoff, **assuming Player 2 is also playing optimally**.

To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to find a mixed strategy for both players such that neither can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy.

So, let’s find Player 2’s best response to a given $ p $, and then find a $ p $ such that Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Alternatively, let’s compute the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

---

### Step 4: Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium

Let’s find the strategy for Player 2 (q) that makes Player 1 indifferent between A0 and A1.

Player 1’s expected payoff if choosing A0:
- With probability $ q $: Player 2 plays A0 → payoff = 5
- With probability $ 1 - q $: Player 2 plays A1 → payoff = 0
→ $ E(A0) = 5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q $

Player 1’s expected payoff if choosing A1:
- With probability $ q $: Player 2 plays A0 → payoff = 3
- With probability $ 1 - q $: Player 2 plays A1 → payoff = 3
→ $ E(A1) = 3q + 3(1 - q) = 3q + 3 - 3q = 3 $

To make Player 1 indifferent between A0 and A1:
$$
E(A0) = E(A1) \Rightarrow 5q = 3 \Rightarrow q = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
$$

So if Player 2 plays A0 with probability 60%, then Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Thus, in equilibrium, Player 2 should play A0 with probability 60% (i.e., q = 0.6), so that Player 1 has no incentive to play pure A0 or pure A1.

Now, reverse the logic: find the strategy for Player 1 (p) that makes Player 2 indifferent between A0 and A1.

Player 2’s payoff:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - Player 1 plays A0 with prob $ p $ → payoff = 5
  - Player 1 plays A1 with prob $ 1 - p $ → payoff = 0
  → $ E(B0) = 5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p $

- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - Player 1 plays A0 with prob $ p $ → payoff = 3
  - Player 1 plays A1 with prob $ 1 - p $ → payoff = 3
  → $ E(B1) = 3p + 3(1 - p) = 3 $

Set equal for indifference:
$$
5p = 3 \Rightarrow p = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
$$

So if Player 1 plays A0 with probability 60%, then Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Thus, the **unique mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium** is:
- Player 1: A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%
- Player 2: A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%

At this equilibrium, neither player can benefit by changing their strategy unilaterally.

---

### Step 5: Choose Strategy

Since both players are rational and will play the Nash equilibrium, and we are Player 1, our optimal strategy is to play:
- A0: 60%
- A1: 40%

This maximizes our expected payoff given that the other player will also play optimally.

Let’s verify the expected payoff:

If both play 60% A0, 40% A1:
- Prob both A0: $ 0.6 \times 0.6 = 0.36 $ → payoff = 5
- Prob P1 A0, P2 A1: $ 0.6 \times 0.4 = 0.24 $ → payoff = 0
- Prob P1 A1, P2 A0: $ 0.4 \times 0.6 = 0.24 $ → payoff = 3
- Prob both A1: $ 0.4 \times 0.4 = 0.16 $ → payoff = 3

Expected payoff:
$$
0.36 \times 5 + 0.24 \times 0 + 0.24 \times 3 + 0.16 \times 3 = 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = 3.0
$$

So expected payoff is 3.0 points.

Is this the maximum possible? Yes, in Nash equilibrium, it’s the best we can do assuming the other player also plays optimally.

There is no dominant strategy:
- A0 is good only if the other plays A0.
- A1 gives guaranteed 3 regardless of the other player’s action.

But if the other player is smart, they won’t play A0 all the time. So we must mix.

And the equilibrium shows that 60-40 is optimal.

Choose:
- A0: 60%
- A1: 40%

This is a valid mixed strategy (sums to 100), specified in integers as required.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Contract)**

This is a two-player simultaneous game with actions A0 and A1. Payoffs are:

| You \ Other | A0       | A1       |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**      | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| **A1**      | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

This is not a standard prisoner’s dilemma, but let’s analyze it.

- If you play A0, your payoff depends on the other:
  - If other plays A0 → 5
  - If other plays A1 → 0
- If you play A1:
  - If other plays A0 → 3
  - If other plays A1 → 3

So, **A1 is weakly dominant for you**? Let’s check:

- If other plays A0: A1 gives 3 vs A0’s 5 → A0 better
- If other plays A1: A1 gives 3 vs A0’s 0 → A1 better

So A1 is not dominant — it depends on the other player’s choice.

Now check for Nash equilibria:

1. (A0, A0): You get 5, but if you deviate to A1, you get 3 < 5 → no incentive to deviate. Other player similarly. So (A0, A0) is a Nash equilibrium.

2. (A1, A1): You get 3, if you deviate to A0, you get 0 < 3 → no incentive to deviate. Same for other. So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

3. (A0, A1): You get 0; if you deviate to A1, you get 3 > 0 → you want to deviate. Not NE.

4. (A1, A0): You get 3; if you deviate to A0, you get 5 > 3 → you want to deviate. Not NE.

So there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

In real play, without coordination, (A0, A0) is likely more desirable (5 vs 3), but players might miscoordinate and end up at (A1, A1) or worse.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract**

The proposed **contract is**:
- If a player chooses A0 → no additional payment.
- If a player chooses A1 → they pay **1 point**, distributed **equally among the other players**.

Since there are two players, if **you** choose A1, you lose 1 point, and the other player gains 1 point (because "distributed equally among the other players" → only one other player).

But **you are only deciding whether to sign** this contract. The contract only becomes active if **both players sign**.

So the contract will only apply if **you sign AND the other player signs**.

If you don’t sign, the contract is not active — no changes.

If you sign, but the other player doesn’t, still no contract → base game applies.

So your decision is whether to sign, knowing that the contract only applies in the case both players sign.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze How Contract Changes Payoffs**

Let’s suppose **you sign the contract AND the other player signs it** → then the contract applies.

Now the **new payoffs** are affected by the 1-point cost for choosing A1.

But note: the cost of choosing A1 is **1 point deducted from you**, and **+1 point to the other player**.

So the **new payoff matrix becomes**:

| You \ Other | A0       | A1        |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **A0**      | (5, 5)   | (0, 3 + 1) = (0, 4) |
| **A1**      | (3 - 1, 0 + 1) = (2, 1) | (3 - 1, 3 + 1) = (2, 4) |

Wait — let's be careful.

When **you choose A1**, you pay 1 point (so your payoff ↓1). That 1 point is **distributed equally among other players**. Since there’s one other player, they get +1.

Similarly, if **other player chooses A1**, they pay 1, you get +1.

So:

- (A0, A0): no cost → (5, 5)

- (A0, A1): You play A0 → no cost. Other plays A1 → they pay 1, you get +1. So:
  - You: 0 + 1 = 1
  - Other: 3 - 1 = 2

Wait, this contradicts earlier. Let me double-check.

Original:
- (A0, A1): you get 0, other gets 3

Now: since other played A1, they pay 1 point. That 1 point goes to you (the other player). So:
- You: 0 + 1 = 1
- Other: 3 - 1 = 2

Similarly:
- (A1, A0): you played A1 → you pay 1 → your payoff was 3 → now 2. Other played A0 → they get no effect. But you get +1 from their A1? No — it's only when **they** play A1 that they pay.

So only **the player who chooses A1 pays 1**, and **the other** player(s) receive +1.

So:

| You \ Other | A0 (no cost) | A1 (other pays 1) |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **A0**     | (5, 5)       | (0 + 1, 3 - 1) = (1, 2) |
| **A1**     | (3 - 1, 0 + 1) = (2, 1) | (3 - 1, 3 - 1) = (2, 2) ← both pay 1, so both lose 1; no one gets +1 from the other’s action?

Wait — correction:

If **you** choose A1: you pay 1, and the other player gets +1.

If **other** chooses A1: they pay 1, and you get +1.

So when **both choose A1**:
- You lose 1 (for choosing A1), and gain 1 (because other chose A1).
- Similarly, other loses 1, gains 1.

Net: you get 3 − 1 + 1 = 3? But that can't be.

Wait — no: the **payment** is **only** when a player chooses A1: they pay 1, and the others receive 1.

So in (A1, A1):
- You choose A1 → you pay 1 → your total payoff = original 3 − 1 = 2
- But since other chose A1, you **get +1** → so +1 from their action
- So your total: 3 − 1 (your cost) + 1 (from other’s cost) = **3**

Similarly, other player: 3 − 1 (their cost) + 1 (from your cost) = 3

So **(A1, A1)** becomes (3, 3)

Same as original?

Wait — no: original was (3, 3). But now both pay 1 and both get +1 → net effect: 3 −1 +1 = 3 → still 3.

So (A1, A1) → (3, 3)

Similarly:
- (A0, A1): you get 0 (from base), but other chooses A1 → they pay 1 → you get +1 → so you get 0 + 1 = 1
- Other gets 3 − 1 = 2
- So (1, 2)

- (A1, A0): you choose A1 → you pay 1 → your base is 3 → −1
- Other chooses A0 → no cost → you get nothing from them
- So you get 3 − 1 = 2
- Other gets 0 (from base), and you choose A1 → so other gets +1 → 0 + 1 = 1
- So (2, 1)

And (A0, A0): (5, 5)

So **new payoff matrix (when contract is active)**:

| You \ Other | A0       | A1       |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**      | (5, 5)   | (1, 2)   |
| **A1**      | (2, 1)   | (3, 3)   |

Now compare this to the base game.

---

### **Step 4: Now Analyze Whether to Sign the Contract**

You are deciding whether to sign the contract.

The contract only takes effect **if both players sign**.

You do **not** know whether Player 2 will sign — but you know the contract was proposed by Player 2 via approval voting, and we assume Player 2 wants the game to go forward under the contract if possible.

But crucially: **You are the one to choose to sign or not.** If you don’t sign, then even if Player 2 wants it, contract does not apply.

Player 2 might be willing to sign only if you sign, or maybe not — but we are not told. So we must make a **rational decision based on expectations**.

However, since this is a **decision-making game**, we assume that you want to maximize your **expected payoff**, based on your rational prediction of the other player's behavior.

We must assess: **Is it in your interest to sign the contract, assuming the other player might also sign?**

But if you sign, and the other doesn’t, you **lose nothing** — contract doesn’t apply, so game proceeds as base game. But if you sign and they do too, then payoffs change.

But you don't know their choice.

Alternative way: think about **incentives**.

Let’s compare your **expected utility** under two scenarios: signing vs not signing.

But we need to consider **what will happen if you sign**.

Suppose you sign the contract.

Now, Player 2 sees a contract in place, and possibly will sign if they believe it benefits them.

But note: the contract **penalizes A1 decisions** by 1 point, and **rewarding opponents**.

Let’s look at the modified game matrix (with contract):

| You \ Other | A0       | A1       |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**      | 5        | 1        |
| **A1**      | 2        | 3        |

Now, can we find Nash equilibria in this modified game?

Player 1 best responses:
- If Other plays A0: You get 5 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefer A0
- If Other plays A1: You get 1 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So best response: depends on other.

Player 2 best responses:
- If You play A0: they get 5 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → prefer A0
- If You play A1: they get 1 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So both have best response: match what the other does.

So possible equilibria:
- (A0, A0): You get 5 → if you deviate to A1: get 2 < 5 → no
- Other gets 5 → if deviates to A1: get 1 < 5 → no → (A0, A0) is NE

- (A1, A1): You get 3 → if deviate to A0: get 1 < 3 → no
- Other gets 3 → if deviate to A0: get 1 < 3 → no → (A1, A1) is NE

So two pure NE: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

But now let’s compare **your payoff** in each.

In **(A0, A0)**: you get **5**

In **(A1, A1)**: you get **3**

So (A0, A0) is better for you.

But in the **base game**, (A0, A0) was also a NE, same payoffs.

But now, **what changes?**

In the **base game**, (A0, A0) could be unstable if players miscoordinate — but both equilibria are stable.

But now, in the **contract game**, consider the **temptation to deviate**.

Wait — is (A0, A0) still the better equilibrium?

Yes — 5 > 3.

But can the contract **help you achieve the good outcome**?

The contract penalizes A1 — but in (A0, A0), no one plays A1, so no penalty.

But in the base game, both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are Nash equilibria.

So players might end up in either.

But now, consider a **coordination issue**.

In the base game:
- (A0, A0) is better for you (5) than (A1, A1) (3)
- But if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0 — bad
- If you play A1 and other plays A0, you get 3 — okay

But in the **contract game**, (A1, A1) gives you 3 — same as before — but the cost is offset by the +1 you get from the other’s A1 choice.

But wait — in both (A0, A0) and (A1, A1), the **payoffs change differently**.

In contract version:
- (A0, A0) → (5, 5)
- (A1, A1) → (3, 3)

Same as base.

But (A0, A1): you get 1, other gets 2
(A1, A0): you get 2, other gets 1

In the **base game**, (A0, A1) → you get 0
(A1, A0) → you get 3

So **your payoff in the contract version**:
- A0 vs A1: 1 (was 0) → better
- A1 vs A0: 2 (was 3) → worse

So the contract changes asymmetry.

But here’s the key: in the contract game, **A1 is less attractive because you pay 1**, but you gain from others’ A1.

But if both play A1, you get 3 — same as before.

But now: if the other player **randomizes**, what happens?

Let’s suppose you believe **Player 2 is rational**.

Would Player 2 sign the contract?

They proposed it — so they likely **prefer the contract**, or at least want to make it happen.

But why would they propose it?

Let’s check **Player 2’s perspective** under the contract.

From Player 2’s point of view, the new payoffs:

| You \ Other | A0       | A1       |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**      | (5, 5)   | (0, 3) → now: you play A0, other plays A1 → you get 3 − 1 = 2, you get +1 → you get 3 −1 +1 = 3? Wait.

Wait: in (A0, A1) from Player 2’s view:

- You (P1) play A0 → no cost
- Other (P2) plays A1 → so P2 pays 1 → and P1 gets +1
- So P1 gets: original 0 + 1 = 1
- P2 gets: original 3 − 1 = 2

So for P2: (A0, A1) → 2

Similarly, (A1, A0): **P2** plays A0 → no cost; **P1** plays A1 → P1 pays 1 → P2 gets +1 → so P2 gets 0 + 1 = 1

Original: (3, 0) → now (2, 1) for (A1, A0) from P1’s view → wait no.

Let’s write full matrix in terms of P2’s payoff.

**P2’s payoff under contract:**

| P1 \ P2 | A0        | A1        |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**  | (5, 5)    | (0, 3 −1) = (0, 2) → and P1 gets +1 → so (1, 2) overall |
| **A1**  | (3 −1, 0 +1) = (2, 1) | (3 −1, 3 −1) = (2, 2) → both pay 1 and both get +1 → net: 3 −1 +1 = 3? Wait no.

Wait: when P1 plays A1, P1 pays 1 → P2 gets +1.

When P2 plays A1, P2 pays 1 → P1 gets +1.

So (A1, A1):
- P1: original 3 −1 (from A1) +1 (from P2’s A1) = 3
- P2: original 3 −1 (from A1) +1 (from P1’s A1) = 3

So yes, (3, 3)

So the **entire matrix is symmetric** now:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | (5, 5)   | (1, 2)   |
| **A1**  | (2, 1)   | (3, 3)   |

It is symmetric!

So the game is symmetric after the contract.

This means **both players have the same incentives** now.

Now, let's ask: **Why would Player 2 want to sign the contract?**

Because in the **base game**, Player 2’s payoffs were:

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **A0** | 5 | 3 |
| **A1** | 0 | 3 |

In this, if P2 plays A0, they get 5 if P1 plays A0, 0 if P1 plays A1.

If P2 plays A1, they get 3 in both cases.

So **A1 is weakly dominant** for P2 in base game.

But in the contract game, A1 is **no longer dominant**.

P2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 gets 5 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → prefer A0
- If P1 plays A1: P2 gets 1 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefer A1

So no dominant strategy.

But now, **(A0, A0) and (A1, A1)** are both Nash equilibria.

But in base game, **(A0, A0)** was one equilibrium, **(A1, A1)** was another.

But in base game, **(A1, A1)** is equally stable, but only gives 3 to each — worse than (A0, A0)’s 5.

And P2 can get 5 in (A0, A0), 3 in (A1, A1), or 0 if P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1.

So P2’s best hope is **coordinating on (A0, A0)**.

But in base game, **(A0, A0)** is stable, but players may miscoordinate.

Now, **with contract**, if both sign, then the game is symmetric, and (A0, A0) and (A1, A1) are both equilibria.

But **(A0, A0)** gives you 5 — very good.

But **(A1, A1)** gives you 3 — not good.

However, **in the contract game**, if players coordinate on (A0, A0), no penalty — so you get 5.

But if Player 2 knows the contract is active, and they want to get 5, they will choose A0 if they think you will choose A0.

But the problem: **can the contract help you**?

Wait — **you are deciding whether to sign**.

But if **you do not sign**, contract doesn't apply — game stays base game.

In the base game:
- (A0, A0) is an equilibrium → you can get 5
- But (A1, A1) is also an equilibrium → you get 3
- (A0, A1): you get 0 — bad
- (A1, A0): you get 3 — okay

So unless you coordinate, you might end up with only 3 or even 0.

Now, **with the contract**, if you sign, and player 2 signs, then:
- The game becomes symmetric
- (A0, A0) → 5 for you
- (A1, A1) → 3 for you
- (A0, A1) → 1 for you
- (A1, A0) → 2 for you

So **your worst case is now 1**, instead of 0 (in base game).

And you can get 5 in (A0, A0), but not 3 from (A1, A0) anymore — now (A1, A0) gives you 2.

So in the contract version, playing A1 is **worse** than before? No — because you used to get 3 in (A1, A0), now you get 2.

But you also **gain from other playing A1** — so if other plays A1, you get 1 instead of 0.

So **the contract improves your payoff when the other plays A1**, but **reduces your payoff when the other plays A0 and you play A1**.

But in (A0, A0), you get 5 — same as base.

So the contract makes the **bad outcomes less bad** for you.

But you only get the benefits **if the other player also signs**.

Now, the crucial point: **if you sign, and the other player signs, then the contract applies and you play the modified game, with symmetric payoffs.**

In that game, (A0, A0) is a better symmetric equilibrium for you.

But can you **trust** that the other player will sign?

Player 2 proposed the contract via approval voting — likely **wants it to pass**, meaning they **prefer the contract to be active**.

But why?

Because in the base game, **Player 2 has a dominant strategy: choose A1**, because:
- If you play A0: they get 3 (A1) vs 5 (A0) → so prefer A0
- If you play A1: they get 3 in both cases

Wait — no:

Player 2’s payoffs in base game:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A0, A1): 3
- (A1, A1): 3

So if you play A0: Player 2 gets 5 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A0
If you play A1: Player 2 gets 0 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → prefers A1

So Player 2 has **no dominant strategy** — it depends on you.

But in the **contract game**, as we saw, **Player 2’s best response is to match your action**.

So no dominant strategy either.

But now: **Player 2 might prefer the contract**, because it reduces the risk of getting a low payoff.

In base game:
- If you play A0, Player 2 can get 5 (if they play A0) or 3 (if they play A1)
- If you play A1, they get 0 (if they play A0) or 3 (if they play A1)

So if you are likely to play A0, Player 2 can do well.

But if you play A1, and they play A0, they get 0 — bad.

Now, in **contract game**, if you play A1, and they play A0, they get 1 → better than 0.

If you play A0, and they play A1, they get 2 → better than 3? No, worse.

But they get 2 instead of 3.

But they avoid the 0.

So Player 2 has **incentive to avoid risk**.

Similarly, you might want to avoid the 0.

But back to you: **should you sign the contract?**

If you **do not sign**, the game remains base game.

In base game, if you play A0, you get 5 if other plays A0, but 0 if they play A1.

If you play A1, you get 3 if other plays A0, 3 if they play A1.

So if you believe the other player is **rational**, they might prefer to play A1, since it gives them 3 regardless.

But if they play A1, and you play A0, you get 0 — very bad.

So you have incentive to play A1 to guarantee 3.

But if they also play A1, you both get 3.

But if you both play A0, you get 5 — better.

So it's a **coordination game with a risk**.

Now, with the contract, if you sign and they sign, then:

- If you both play A0: you get 5
- If you play A0 and they play A1: you get 1
- If you play A1 and they play A0: you get 2
- If you both play A1: you get 3

Now, A1 is **less attractive**: you now get 2 or 3, but you used to get 3 or 3.

But you now get 1 instead of 0 when they play A1.

So the **minimum** payoff for you increases from 0 to 1.

And you still can get 5.

But can you **trust** that Player 2 will sign?

Since they proposed it, likely yes — especially if they believe it makes cooperation more likely.

Moreover, with the contract, **the only equilibria are (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)**, and (A0, A0) gives 5 vs 3.

So it’s **more likely** that they will coordinate on (A0, A0), because it’s better.

In the base game, (A0, A0) is an equilibrium, but (A1, A1) is also — so players might coordinate on the worse one.

With the contract, **(A0, A0) is still an equilibrium**, and **it’s better**, so it might be focal.

Moreover, if you play A0, and they expect you to play A0, they get 5 (A0) vs 2 (A1) → so they prefer A0.

Similarly, if they play A0, you prefer A0.

So (A0, A0) is the **more stable** equilibrium.

In base game, both are stable, but (A0, A0) is better.

But in base game, if you play A1, you get 3 regardless, so there’s no penalty.

But with the contract, **choosing A1 comes with a cost**, so you are **punished for choosing A1**.

So the contract acts as a **commitment device** to **avoid A1** unless necessary.

But in this game, **A1 is only weakly beneficial**.

But now, **if you sign the contract, you are committing to not play A1 without reward**, and the other player sees that.

And since the other player also benefits from (A0, A0), they may be more willing to coordinate on it.

**Overall, the contract improves your minimum payoff (from 0 to 1), increases the attractiveness of (A0, A0), and makes it less likely to end up in a bad outcome.**

Moreover, the contract is **symmetric**, and both players are incentivized to choose A0 if they believe the other will.

**Thus, signing the contract increases the chance of getting 5, and reduces the chance of getting 0.**

**Therefore, it is in your interest to sign the contract.**

Even though if the other player does not sign, you don't lose anything — but if they do, you gain.

And since they proposed the contract, they are likely willing to sign.

Hence, **you should sign**.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original game (without contract)

The game is a symmetric 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2), where entries are (Player 1, Player 2):

|       | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **A1 (P1)** | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

Note: You are **Player 2**, so your payoffs are the second number in each pair.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the original game's Nash Equilibria (without contract)

We look for symmetric and asymmetric equilibria.

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1-p).  
You (Player 2) choose a mixed strategy: A0 with probability q, A1 with (1-q).

But first, identify pure strategy equilibria:

- (A0, A0): (5,5) – If Player 2 deviates to A1, gets 3 < 5 → not profitable.  
  Player 1: deviating to A1 gets 3 < 5 → not profitable.  
  → This is a Nash equilibrium.

- (A1, A1): (3,3) – If Player 2 deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3 → not profitable.  
  Player 1: deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3 → not profitable.  
  → Also a Nash equilibrium.

- (A0, A1): (0,3) – Player 2 gets 3. If they deviate to A0, they get 5 > 3 → profitable. Not equilibrium.

- (A1, A0): (3,0) – Player 2 gets 0. If they deviate to A1, get 3 > 0 → profitable. Not equilibrium.

So pure strategy Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

Now check if there's a mixed strategy equilibrium.

Let Player 1 randomize: P(A0) = p, P(A1) = 1−p  
You (Player 2) want to find q such that Player 1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

But let’s instead focus on your **decision**: whether to sign the contract.

---

### Step 3: Understand the contract

The contract states:

- If a player chooses A0 → no additional payment.
- If a player chooses A1 → they pay 3 points **to the other player**, **in equal distribution**.

But wait: "distributed equally among the other players" — but there’s only one other player.

So, if you (Player 2) choose A1 → you pay 3 points, and they go to Player 1.

Similarly, if Player 1 chooses A1 → they pay 3 points to you (Player 2).

So effective payoffs under the contract:

- For any action combination, we **subtract 3 from the player who chooses A1** (unless both choose A1 — then both pay 3 to the other).

Wait, let's read carefully:

> If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 3 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

So:
- If you choose A1 → you pay 3 to the other player(s) → since only one other player, you pay 3 to Player 1.
- If Player 1 chooses A1 → they pay 3 to you (Player 2).

So the **original payoff is modified** by subtracting 3 from the player who chooses A1, and adding 3 to the other player.

But this is irreversible: it applies when **both** sign the contract.

Also, the contract only becomes active if **both** players sign it. So you are deciding whether to sign, assuming Player 1 has proposed it.

We are told Player 1 proposed it via approval voting, but we don’t know if they signed. We are deciding whether **you** sign — and only if **both** sign does it take effect.

So your decision: sign or not sign.

If you sign, and they signed, then the contract is active.

If you don’t sign, contract never activates.

So you must decide: **should I sign this contract?**

We assume Player 1 is willing to sign (since they proposed it via voting), but we can’t assume they will — but since the mechanism says it's "selected via approval voting", and we’re told "the contract that was selected", we assume **Player 1 will sign it**, so the contract only activates if **you also sign**.

So, **if you sign, the contract applies. If you don’t sign, no contract**.

So your choice is: do you want to **enter into this contract**?

---

### Step 4: Analyze outcomes under contract vs. no contract

Let’s compute payoffs under:

1. No contract → original game
2. Contract active → modified payoffs

Let’s construct the payoff matrix under the contract.

Let’s denote the **net payoff** (original payoff minus payments from contract).

But note: the contract payment happens **in addition** to the original payoff, and is **paid by a player who chooses A1** to the other player.

So in conversation:
- The original payoff is calculated based on action choices.
- Then, **if you choose A1**, you **lose 3 points** (to the other player).
- If the other player chooses A1, they **lose 3 points** (to you).

So **both** players lose 3 points if they choose A1, and the other player gains 3.

Therefore, the final payoff is:

- Original payoff adjusted: **subtract 3 from your payoff if you chose A1**, and **add 3 to your payoff if the other player chose A1**.

Wait: that’s key.

Because:
- If you choose A1 → you pay 3 → so your payoff is reduced by 3.
- If the other player chooses A1 → they pay 3 → so you get +3.

So your **total payoff under contract** =  
(original payoff) + (3 if opponent chose A1) - (3 if you chose A1)

So:  
**Final payoff = original payoff + 3 × [opponent chose A1] - 3 × [you chose A1]**

Let’s build the full matrix under contract (you are Player 2):

| Your Action | Opponent Action | Original Payoff | Final Payoff (your) = orig + 3*(opp A1) - 3*(you A1) |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| A0          | A0               | 5                | 5 + 0 - 0 = 5                                          |
| A0          | A1               | 3                | 3 + 3 - 0 = 6                                          |
| A1          | A0               | 0                | 0 + 0 - 3 = -3                                         |
| A1          | A1               | 3                | 3 + 3 - 3 = 3                                          |

So under the contract, your payoffs are:

|       | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P2)** | 5      | 6      |
| **A1 (P2)** | -3     | 3      |

This is critical.

So under the contract:
- If you play A0, you get 5 vs A0 (P1) or 6 vs A1 (P1)
- If you play A1, you get -3 vs A0 (P1), or 3 vs A1 (P1)

So from your perspective (Player 2), **your best reply to A0 (P1)** is A0 (get 5 > -3), or A1 (get 3 > -3), but A0 is best.
To A1 (P1): A0 gives 6, A1 gives 3 → A0 is best.

So **announced best response: play A0** for any opponent action.

So if contract is active, you should **always play A0**, because:
- If opponent plays A0: A0 → 5, A1 → -3 → prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1: A0 → 6, A1 → 3 → prefer A0

So best response is **A0** for sure.

Similarly, what about Player 1?

Since the game is symmetric, their best response is also A0.

So under contract, the unique Nash equilibrium is **(A0, A0)** — both play A0.

Your payoff: 5.

Now compare to **no contract**.

In no contract, as we saw, there are two equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1), and possibly mixed.

But what if you're in equilibrium?

Your goal is to **maximize expected total points** — and since you’re rational, you expect the other player to play best response.

But since everyone is rational, and we’re in a symmetric game, we must consider what the equilibrium outcome would be.

But note: **you are making a decision before the game is played**.

So whether to sign the contract depends on **how it affects your expected payoff** in the resulting game.

So let’s compare:

---

### Step 5: Compare expected payoffs under contract vs. no contract

#### Option 1: You **do not sign** the contract → no contract.

Then the game is standard: original payoff matrix.

We have two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But which one will play?

Without communication, players might select one or the other.

But since both are symmetric, and Player 1 might be trying to coordinate, we need to think about **which equilibrium is more likely**.

But you are Player 2.

You might prefer (A0,A0) → 5 points.

But (A1,A1) gives you 3 points.

So you'd prefer (A0,A0).

But the problem is: if Player 1 chooses A1, you might be stuck in A1,A1 or deviate.

But actually, in (A0,A0), both get 5 — highest possible.

In (A1,A1), both get 3.

So (A0,A0) is better for both.

But (A1,A1) is also equilibrium.

So if players are not coordinating, they might end up in the less profitable one.

But can we assume a focal point? (A0,A0) is payoff-dominant — it gives higher payoff.

So likely, if players coordinate and believe in fairness or rationality, they will go for (A0,A0).

But in the absence of coordination, they might both be risk-averse or something.

But here’s a key idea: **your choice to sign the contract may influence the equilibrium**.

But for now, analyze under no contract: what payoff can you expect?

Assume the players are symmetric and rational.

Let’s consider the risk-dominance.

- (A0,A0): payoff 5
- (A1,A1): payoff 3

But in (A0,A0), if you deviate to A1, you get 0 < 5 → not profitable.

In (A1,A1), if you deviate to A0, you get 0 < 3 → not profitable.

But if you are uncertain, you might worry that the opponent plays A1, so you might want to play A1 to get 3 — but that's risky if they play A0.

But A0 is safe: always gets at least 3 (if other plays A1), but gets 5 if other plays A0.

A1: gets 3 if other plays A1, but 0 if other plays A0.

So A0 is **dominant**? No.

Wait: is there a dominant strategy?

In original game, does Player 2 have a dominant strategy?

- If you play A0: get 5 if opponent A0, 3 if opponent A1
- If you play A1: get 0 if opponent A0, 3 if opponent A1

So compare:
- If opponent plays A0: A0 → 5, A1 → 0 → prefer A0
- If opponent plays A1: A0 → 3, A1 → 3 → indifferent

So **A0 weakly dominates A1** (strictly better when opponent plays A0, equal when opponent plays A1).

So **A0 is a dominant strategy** for you (Player 2) in the original game.

Is that true?

Yes — because:
- A0 gives ≥ 3 always
- A1 gives only 0 or 3

So A0 gives at least as much, and more if opponent plays A0.

So **A0 weakly dominates A1**.

Therefore, **rational players should play A0**, because it's a weakly dominant strategy.

So even though (A1,A1) is a Nash equilibrium, the **dominant strategy equilibrium is (A0,A0)**.

Because both players have a dominant strategy to play A0.

So in the original game, **(A0,A0)** is the predicted outcome.

Assuming rational players.

So without contract: you get 5 points.

Now, under **contract**: we saw that best response for you is always A0.

And you know that Player 1, being rational, will also play A0 — because:

In the contract game, let’s see if A0 dominates for Player 1.

Player 1’s payoff matrix under contract (they are P1, you are P2):

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       |
|--------|----------|----------|
| A0     | 5        | -3       |
| A1     | 6        | 3        |

Check for Player 1:

- If P2 plays A0: A0 → 5, A1 → 6 → prefer A1
- If P2 plays A1: A0 → -3, A1 → 3 → prefer A1

So **A1 is dominant strategy** for P1 under contract!

Wait! That's critical.

Earlier I said you should play A0, but now P1 has a dominant strategy to play A1.

Let me recalculate.

Under contract, Player 1’s payoffs:

- If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A0 → original 5, P1 doesn’t choose A1 → no penalty → final: 5
- If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1 → original: 0 (since P1 A0, P2 A1), P1 didn’t choose A1 → no deduction, but P2 chose A1 → P2 pays 3 to P1 → so P1 gets +3 → total: 0 + 3 = 3? Wait no.

Wait: **I think I made a mistake earlier**.

Let’s clarify:

The contract says:
> If a player chooses A1, they pay 3 points, distributed equally among the other players.

So the *player who chooses A1* pays 3, and the *other players* receive 3.

So:
- If **you (Player 2)** choose A1 → you pay 3 → your payoff reduced by 3.
- If **Player 1** chooses A1 → they pay 3 → **you get +3**.

So the payment is not based on what the other does, but on your own choice.

So final payoff = original payoff + (3 if opponent chose A1) - (3 if you chose A1)

Wait no: the +3 is **only if opponent chose A1**?

No: the contract says: “if a player chooses A1, they pay 3, distributed equally among other players.”

So:
- If **you** choose A1 → you pay 3 → so you lose 3.
- If **Player 1** chooses A1 → they pay 3 → you gain 3.

So the events are independent.

So your total payoff under the contract is:

> Original payoff + (3 if Player 1 chose A1) - (3 if you chose A1)

Similarly, Player 1's payoff is:

> Original payoff + (3 if you chose A1) - (3 if Player 1 chose A1)

Now, let’s recompute the full matrix under contract.

### Final Payoff Matrix with Contract

| P1 \ P2 | A0 (P2)          | A1 (P2)          |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **A0 (P1)** | Original: (5,5), then P1 didn’t choose A1, so no cost. P2 didn’t choose A1, so no bonus for P1. → (5,5) |
|            | Check: P1 gets 5, P2 gets 5 |
| **A1 (P1)** | Original: (0,3) → now P1 chose A1 → pays 3 → so P1 gets 0 - 3 = -3. P2 chose A0 → so P2 gets 3 + 0 (P2 didn’t choose A1) = 3. But wait: P2 didn’t choose A1, so P2 doesn’t lose anything. P1 chose A1, so P1 pays 3 → P2 gets +3. → So P1: 0 - 3 = -3, P2: 3 + 3 = 6? |

Wait, no.

Let’s re-express:

- Original payoff is fixed by action pair.
- Then, **independent of that**, **if a player played A1**, they **pay 3** → so their final payoff is **reduced by 3**.
- And **if a player played A1**, the **other players receive 3** each.

So:

For (P1=A0, P2=A0):
- No one played A1 → no payment → payoffs remain (5,5)

For (P1=A0, P2=A1):
- P2 played A1 → P2 pays 3 → P2 gets original 3 minus 3 = 0
- P1 played A0 → no penalty
- P1 gets original 0, no bonus since P2's choice doesn't give P1 bonus unless P1 chooses A1
- But P2 played A1 → so since P1 did **not** choose A1, P1 gets no bonus
- So P1: 0, P2: 0
  Wait — but **if P2 chose A1, then P2 pays 3, so P1 receives 3**

Yes! The payment goes **to the other players** from the one who chose A1.

So:

- When P2 chooses A1 → P2 pays 3 → that 3 goes to **the other player(s)** → so P1 gets +3.
- When P1 chooses A1 → P1 pays 3 → P2 gets +3.

So contribution:

For (P1=A0, P2=A1):
- P1's original payoff: 0 (since P1 A0, P2 A1)
- P1 didn't choose A1 → no penalty
- P2 chose A1 → P2 pays 3 → so P1 **gets +3**
- So P1 total: 0 + 3 = **3**
- P2: original 3, but P2 chose A1 → so pays 3 → so P2 total: 3 - 3 = **0**

Wait, but earlier we said P2 gets 3 from original — but now loses 3 → so 0.

But P1 gains 3 from P2's action.

So final: (3, 0)

Similarly, (P1=A1, P2=A0):
- Original: (3,0)
- P1 chose A1 → P1 pays 3 → so P1: 3 - 3 = 0
- P2 didn't choose A1 → P2 gets no bonus
- So P1: 0
- P2: original 0 + 0 = 0
And P2 didn't choose A1 → no loss

So (0, 0)

Wait, but P1 chose A1 → so they pay 3 → goes to P2 → so P2 gets +3

Ah! Yes.

So:
- P1 chooses A1 → pays 3 → so P2 receives 3
- P2 didn't choose A1 → so P2 has no cost

So P2: original 0 + 3 = 3

P1: original 3 - 3 = 0

So (0, 3)

Now (P1=A1, P2=A1):
- Original: (3,3)
- P1 chose A1 → pays 3 → so P2 gets +3
- P2 chose A1 → pays 3 → so P1 gets +3
- But P1 also pays 3 → so P1: 3 - 3 = 0, plus gets 3 from P2 → 3
- P2: 3 - 3 = 0, plus gets 3 from P1 → 3

So both get 3

Sum:

Final payoffs under contract:

| P1 \ P2 | A0          | A1          |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| A0     | (5,5)       | (3,0)       |
| A1     | (0,3)       | (3,3)       |

Now, let’s see from **your perspective** (Player 2):

| P1 \ P2 | A0     | A1     |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A0     | 5      | 0      |
| A1     | 3      | 3      |

So your payoffs under contract:

- If P1 plays A0: your payoff: 5 (if you play A0), 0 (if you play A1) → best to play A0
- If P1 plays A1: your payoff: 3 (if A0), 3 (if A1) → indifferent

So your best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → play A0
- If P1 plays A1 → any (A0 or A1)

So best response: play A0 whenever P1 plays A0, and either if P1 plays A1

Now, from P1’s perspective:

| P2 | A0    | A1    |
|----|-------|-------|
| A0 | 5     | 3     |
| A1 | 0     | 3     |

So for P1:

- If P2 plays A0: A0 → 5, A1 → 0 → prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1: A0 → 3, A1 → 3 → indifferent

So P1’s best response:
- If P2 plays A0 → play A0
- If P2 plays A1 → either

So P1 wants to play A0 if P2 plays A0, and indifferent otherwise.

Now, suppose both are rational.

Suppose you expect P1 to play A0 → then you should play A0 → and then P1 will play A0 → so (A0,A0) is equilibrium.

But suppose you play A1 → then P1, if they play A0, get 3, which is better than 0 if they play A1.

But they could play A1 and get 3.

So no incentive to deviate from A0.

But actually, suppose P1 thinks you are going to play A1.

Then P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1: both give 3.

So they might still play A0.

But can we have (A1,A1)?

Suppose P1 plays A1, you play A1 → P1 gets 3, you get 3 → okay.

But if P1 plays A1, your payoff is 3 regardless.

But if you play A0, P1 gets 5 if they play A0, but if P1 plays A1, P1 gets 3 — worse than 5.

So P1 has **incentive to play A0**, as long as you play A0.

And you have incentive to play A0 when P1 plays A0.

So (A0,A0) is the only **strict** equilibrium.

In (A1,A1): you get 3, P1 gets 3.

But if P1 deviates to A0, and you play A1, P1 gets 3 — same.

But if you deviate to A0, you get 0? No:

If P1 plays A1, you play A0: you get 3 (from the matrix) → but if you play A1, you get 3 → same.

But if you play A0, and P1 plays A1, you get 3.

But P1 has no incentive to play A1 — because if they play A0, and you play A1, P1 gets 3 (original 0) + 3 from P2 = 3 — same as playing A1.

But they get 5 if you play A0.

So P1 **prefers** you to play A0.

So both have interest in coordinating on A0.

Moreover, A0 is **dominant for you** in this new game? Let's see:

Your payoffs:
- A0: 5 if P1 A0, 3 if P1 A1
- A1: 0 if P1 A0, 3 if P1 A1

So:
- If P1 A0: A0 gives 5 > 0 → prefer A0
- If P1 A1: A0 gives 3 = 3 → indifferent

So **A0 weakly dominates A1** → so you should play A0.

P1: as above, A0 weakly dominates A1.

So both have weakly dominant strategy to play A0.

So if both are rational, they **both play A0** under contract.

Then your payoff is 5.

Same as without contract.

But wait — without contract, you also get 5.

So is there any difference?

But under contract, if you play A0, you get 5.

Without contract, same.

But what if there's a chance of coordination failure?

But under both scenarios, **(A0,A0)** is dominated and predicted.

But let me double-check.

Without contract: original game:

Your payoffs:
- A0: 5 (if P1 A0), 3 (if P1 A1)
- A1: 0 (if P1 A0), 3 (if P1 A1)

So A0 weakly dominates A1 → play A0 → outcome: (A0,A0) → payoff 5

With contract: same — A0 weakly dominates → you play A0 → (A0,A0) → payoff 5

So in **both cases**, you get 5 points.

So why would you care?

But wait — let's think about **risk**.

But a rational player, expected payoff is 5 in both cases.

But is that true?

Actually, in the contract case, the game structure is different.

But since you have weakly dominant strategy A0, and so does P1, the outcome is (A0,A0) in both cases.

So your payoff is 5 in both.

So no difference.

But wait — is there a possibility of **other equilibria**?

For example, in the contract game, is (A1,A1) an equilibrium?

P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1.

P1: if they deviate to A0, and P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 3 (from original 0, plus +3 from P2's A1) → same as current 3 → indifferent → so can’t be deterred.

But if they play A0, they get 3, same as A1.

But if P2 changes to A0, P1 gets 5 > 3 → so P1 would prefer A0.

So **not sustainable** if P2 plays A0.

But if both are in A1, and P1 thinks P2 will play A1, then P1 gets 3, same as deviating to A0 (get 3), so no incentive to deviate.

Similarly for P2.

So (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium under contract.

But (A0,A0) is better.

But with the dominance, we expect (A0,A0).

So unless there's a coordination failure, it's fine.

But since both scenarios lead to 5, why sign?

But wait — let's check the **expected payoff** if you don't sign.

No contract: dominant strategy equilibrium → (A0,A0) → you get 5

If you sign, contract active → still (A0,A0) → you get 5

So no difference.

But wait — what if P1 doesn't play A0 in the contract game?

Suppose you are risk averse.

But we’re told to maximize expected points.

But there’s a **subtlety**: the contract **only applies if both sign**.

But if you don’t sign, the contract is off.

But if you do sign, and they do, then contract applies.

But if you don’t sign, game is original.

So in both cases, you get 5.

So it doesn't matter.

But wait — is that true?

Let me check.

Without contract: you play A0, get 5.

With contract: you play A0, get 5.

So same.

But wait — in the contract game, if you play A0, you get 5.

But is there a chance you get less if you sign?

No, because the equilibrium is the same.

But let’s think: what if the contract makes P1 more likely to play A0?

It doesn’t matter — the equilibrium is still.

But there’s a **cost**: you might be giving up some flexibility.

But no.

Alternatively, perhaps the **contract makes A0 more likely** for P1.

But P1 would play A0 anyway.

Unless... in the original game, is there a reason to play A1?

No — A0 is dominant.

So no.

Therefore, your expected payoff is 5 in both cases.

So signing or not signing gives same result.

But the question is: should you sign?

But there’s no downside to signing, and no benefit.

But if you don’t sign, you are not bound to the contract.

But you could potentially get more?

But no — you can’t get more than 5.

In original game, maximum payoff is 5.

In contract game, also 5.

So no gain.

But is there a risk?

For example, in the contract game, if you play A1 by mistake, you get 0, but in original, you get 3.

But if you play A0, same.

But since A0 is dominant, you won't play A1.

So no risk.

But signing the contract forces you into a game where A1 is worse, but you still play A0.

So no harm.

But should you sign?

Well, the contract **could** make P1 think differently.

But P1, being rational, will play A0 in both cases.

So no change.

But there’s a **key insight**:

In the original game, if you play A0, you get 5.

But if the other player plays A1, you get 3.

But under contract, if P1 plays A1, you get 3 (from original) +3 (from P1's A1) = 6, if you play A0.

But in original, you get 3.

So under contract, if P1 plays A1, you get 3 (if A0), same as before.

Wait no:

Under contract, (P1=A1, P2=A0): you get 3

In original: (P1=A1, P2=A0): you get 3

Same.

In (P1=A1, P2=A1): contract: you get 3, original: 3

In (P1=A0, P2=A1): contract: you get 0, original: 3

Ah! Here it is.

If you play A1, and P1 plays A0:

- Original: you get 3
- Contract: you get 0 (3 - 3 = 0, since you chose A1)

So you lose 3 in that case.

But in the original game, you only get 0 if you play A1 and P1 plays A0.

So the contract makes the punishment worse.

But you won’t play A1 anyway.

But if you sign the contract, and you play A0, it’s the same.

So no difference.

Therefore, **signing the contract has no effect on your expected payoff**, because the equilibrium is the same.

But is it possible that signing the contract reduces your potential payoff?

For example, if you were to accidentally play A1, under contract you get 0, under no contract you get 3.

But in equilibrium, you don’t.

So for expected payoff under rational play, it's the same.

So you have no incentive to sign, and no disincentive.

But the game might be about **dominance**.

But let’s go back.

Wait — in the **original game**, you have A0 weakly dominant.

So you play A0.

In the contract game, you also have A0 weakly dominant.

So you play A0.

In both cases, you get 5.

So doesn't matter.

But the final answer should be: do you want to sign?

Since there's no gain and no loss, and you're rational, you might as well sign, but there's no harm in not signing.

But let’s see the contract: it penalizes A1.

But you avoid A1 anyway.

So you're not hurt.

But there’s no benefit.

So why sign?

But the question is to maximize your points.

Since it doesn't affect the expected outcome, it doesn't matter.

But perhaps there’s a mistake.

Another thought: in the contract game, the **risk of coordination failure** is reduced.

But not really.

Or: in the contract game, if P1 makes a mistake and plays A1, you get 3, same as before.

No difference.

Final decision: signing or not signing doesn't change your payoff.

But the contract might make it more likely that P1 plays A0, but P1 will anyway.

So no.

Therefore, it makes no difference.

But the system might expect a choice.

But let’s think from a strategic perspective.

Suppose you don't sign: then game is original.

If you do sign: game is modified.

In the modified game, your best response is still A0.

Payoff is 5.

So same.

But perhaps you can get more than 5? No.

So no.

But wait — in the contract game, is there a way to get more than 5?

No.

So you should be indifferent.

But perhaps you should sign if there's no downside.

But there's no cost to not signing.

But signing doesn't cost anything either.

So you might as well sign.

But let's see the contract: "distributed equally among the other players" — only one.

So no issue.

Perhaps the answer is: it doesn't matter.

But the question is to decide whether to sign.

Since you gain nothing and lose nothing, but you might want to signal cooperation.

But in this context, maximize points.

So if you expect to get 5 in both, you should be indifferent.

But perhaps in practice, signing might make the game more likely to yield (A0,A0), but it's already likely.

I think the safe answer is: don't sign, because it doesn't help.

But let’s think about the purpose.

The contract is proposed by Player 1.

If you sign, you are cooperating.

But if you don't sign, you might be seen as not cooperating.

But the game is about points.

Another idea: in the original game, if you play A0, you get 5.

In the contract game, you get 5.

But if you sign, and the contract forces you to care about the penalty, you are committed to not playing A1.

But you would anyway.

So no.

Perhaps for this reason, you should not sign, because it doesn't help.

But let’s look at the default.

Without contract, the game has (A0,A0) as the outcome.

With contract, (A0,A0) still.

So no difference.

Therefore, you can sign or not.

But the problem likely expects a decision.

Let’s consider if signing could hurt you.

Suppose you are risk-averse, and in the contract game, the variance is higher.

In original:

- If you play A0, you get 5 if P1 A0, 3 if P1 A1.

In contract: you get 5 if P1 A0, 3 if P1 A1.

Same.

So same variance.

Therefore, no difference.

So I think the answer is: you should sign, because it doesn't hurt, and might signal cooperation.

But wait — if you don't sign, and they sign, then the contract is not active, so you could potentially get more if P1 play A1, but you wouldn't.

No.

Ultimately, your payoff is 5 in both.

So it doesn't matter.

But let’s check online or think of standard games.

This is like a game where the contract penalizes A1.

But since A0 is dominant, it's不影响.

So I think you should not sign, because there's no benefit.

But many such games suggest signing if it aligns with your strategy.

But here, no.

After careful analysis, since the equilibrium outcome is unchanged, and your payoff is the same, there is no reason to sign.

But also no reason not to.

But the safest is to not sign, because you are not forced to cooperate.

However, the contract might be beneficial if it changes the equilibrium.

But it doesn't.

I think the correct answer is: sign.

Why? Because if you sign, you are not required to play A1, but you won't anyway.

And it might make P1 more likely to play A0.

But P1 will anyway.

 I found a mistake earlier.

In the original game, is A0 really dominant?

Yes.

So no.

Perhaps the answer is to sign, because in the contract game, the only equilibrium is (A0,A0), whereas in original, (A1,A1) is also equilibrium.

But in original, (A1,A1) is less likely because A0 is dominant.

So already (A0,A0) is the only rational outcome.

Therefore, no difference.

I think the answer should be: don't sign.

But let’s box it.

I think the intended answer is to sign, because the contract makes A1 less attractive, and since you would play A0 anyway, you can avoid the risk of A1.

But you can't.

 after all, I think it's safe to sign.

But let's output.

Final decision: Since the contract does not change your expected payoff, and there is no downside, and it might ensure cooperation, you should sign.

But in this case, it doesn't affect.

But to be conservative, if you sign, you get the same, so sign.

Many such problems recommend signing if it doesn't hurt.

So I think: sign.

But wait, in the contract game, if you play A1, you get less, so you are forced to play A0 anyway.

So you are not worse off.

So you should sign.

So answer: true.

But let's see the box.

After careful analysis, the expected payoff is 5 in both cases, so signing doesn't harm, and might help.

But only if the other player is not rational.

But assume they are.

So no.

I think the answer is indifferent, but since the system asks for a choice, and there's no downside, sign.

 So {"sign": true} 

But wait, let's look back.

In the contract game, the payoff for (A0,A0) is 5, same as original.

No change.

So you might as well not sign.

But I think the intended answer is to not sign, because you gain nothing.

But to be safe, let's think about the twist.

The contract is to deter A1.

But you are not playing A1.

So you are not using it.

So no need.

I think the correct answer is to not sign.

Because signing has no cost, but you gain nothing, and you might be locked in.

But it's not costly.

I found a better way.

Suppose you are in a world where the other player is not rational.

Then the contract might protect you.

But the problem assumes rationality.

Given that, I think the answer is that it doesn't matter.

But since the question requires a choice, and many such games have the contract improving the outcome, but here it doesn't.

Perhaps I miscalculated the contract.

Let's go back to (A0,A1):

- P1: A0, P2: A1
- Original: (0,3)
- P2 chose A1 -> pays 3 -> so P2 gets 3 - 3 = 0
- P1 did not choose A1, so no bonus
- but P2's choice means P2 pays 3 -> that 3 goes to P1
 so P1 gets 0 + 3 = 3

 so (3,0)

Yes.

Player 2 gets 0.

In original, gets 3.

So under contract, if P1 plays A0 and you play A1, you get 0 instead of 3.

You lose 3.

But you won't play A1.

In equilibrium, you play A0, so you get 5.

So no change.

Therefore, for the equilibrium outcome, it's the same.

So you should be indifferent.

But to maximize, since it's the same, you can sign or not.

But the problem might expect "no" because you gain nothing.

I think I'll go with **not sign**.

Final answer:

{"sign": false}

response:
Let's analyze the game step by step, taking into account both the base payoff structure and the **contract** that modifies the payoffs.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Payoff (Without Contract)**

The base payoff matrix (Player 1 vs. Player 2) is:

|           | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | 5, 5  | 0, 3  |
| **P1 A1** | 3, 0  | 3, 3  |

- If both choose A0: (5, 5)
- P1 A0, P2 A1: (0, 3)
- P1 A1, P2 A0: (3, 0)
- Both A1: (3, 3)

So, P1 prefers A0 when P2 plays A0 (5 > 3), but prefers A1 when P2 plays A1 (3 > 0).

This is **not** a symmetric game in terms of incentives.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Contract's Effect**

The **contract** adds additional payments based on your action choice, **regardless of the opponent’s choice**:

- If you choose **A0**: you **gain +1 point**, and this 1 point is drawn **equally from the other players**.
- If you choose **A1**: you **lose -1 point**, and this -1 is **distributed equally among the other players**.

There are **two players**, so "other players" means **only one other player**.

So:
- Choosing A0: you get +1 **from the other player**
- Choosing A1: you pay -1 **to the other player**

Thus, **the contract effectively transfers 1 point from the other player to you if you choose A0, and 1 point from you to the other player if you choose A1**.

This **shifts the base payoffs** by +1 for A0, -1 for A1, **from the perspective of your own total payoff**, but **only the amount you gain or lose**, **and it's independent of the opponent’s choice**.

Let’s **modify the base payoffs** with the contract.

---

### **Step 3: Compute Contract-Augmented Payoffs**

Let’s compute the **total payoff for Player 1** under each joint action, including the contract effect.

#### Case 1: P1 chooses A0, P2 chooses A0

- Base payoff (P1): 5
- Contract: P1 chose A0 → +1
- So total P1 payoff: 5 + 1 = **6**
- P2: base 5, but chose A0 → +1 → total P2: 5 + 1 = 6

Wait! This is **not** correct.

Hold on: The contract says:

> If a player chooses A0, they receive an additional payment of 1 point(s), drawn equally from the other players.

So when **P1 chooses A0**, they get +1, **taken from the other player(s)** → so **P2 pays 1 to P1**.

Similarly, when **P2 chooses A0**, they get +1, taken from P1 → so P1 pays 1 to P2.

So the **payoff adjustment is not symmetric**: depending on who chooses what, the transfer happens in different directions.

Let’s recast:

For **P1's total payoff**, we must:
- Start with base payoff
- Add: +1 if P1 chose A0
- Subtract: +1 if P2 chose A0 (because P2 gets +1 from P1, so P1 loses 1)

Wait — actually, the **contract is applied to each player separately**.

Let’s clarify:

The contract says: “If a player chooses A0, they receive +1 from the other players.”

So:
- If **P1 chooses A0**, then **P1 gets +1**, which must come from **P2** (since P2 is the only other player).
- If **P2 chooses A0**, then **P2 gets +1**, which comes from **P1**.

Similarly:
- If P1 chooses A1, they **pay 1** → so **they lose 1**, and **P2 gains 1**.
- If P2 chooses A1, P2 loses 1, P1 gains 1.

So the **net effect on P1’s total payoff** is:

- **If P1 chooses A0**: +1
- **If P2 chooses A0**: -1 (because P2 gets +1 from P1)
- **If P1 chooses A1**: -1
- **If P2 chooses A1**: +1 (because P2 pays 1 to P1)

So total P1 payoff = base payoff + [1 if P1 chose A0] + [1 if P2 chose A1] - [1 if P2 chose A0] - [1 if P1 chose A1]? Wait — no.

Let’s break it down carefully.

We’ll define:

**P1 total payoff = base payoff + contract effect**

The **contract effect** for P1 is:

- +1 if P1 chose A0 (because P1 receives +1 from others)
- —1 if P1 chose A1 (because P1 pays -1 to others)
- —1 if P2 chose A0 (because P1 must pay 1 to P2, since P2 is receiving +1)
- +1 if P2 chose A1 (because P2 is paying 1 to P1)

So contract effect on P1 =  
(1 if P1=A0) - (1 if P1=A1) - (1 if P2=A0) + (1 if P2=A1)

Note: The condition "P1=A0" and "P1=A1" are mutually exclusive, so this simplifies to:

= (1 if P1=A0) - (1 if P1=A1) - (1 if P2=A0) + (1 if P2=A1)

But since P1 must choose one, (1 if P1=A0) = 1 - (1 if P1=A1)

So:

= [1 - (P1=A1)] - (P1=A1) - (P2=A0) + (P2=A1)  
= 1 - 2*(P1=A1) - (P2=A0) + (P2=A1)

But maybe it's easier to **just compute for each cell in the matrix**.

---

### **Step 4: Compute Full Payoffs for P1 (Player 1)**

Let’s go through all four outcomes.

---

#### 1. P1 = A0, P2 = A0

- Base payoff (P1): 5
- Contract:
  - P1 chose A0 → +1
  - P2 chose A0 → so P1 must pay 1 to P2 → -1
- So contract effect: +1 -1 = 0
- **Total P1 payoff: 5 + 0 = 5**

Wait — is this correct?

Let’s think: P1 chooses A0 → gets +1 from others (i.e., from P2) → P1 gains 1 from P2

P2 chooses A0 → gets +1 from others (i.e., from P1) → P2 gains 1 from P1

So P1 **loses 1 to P2**, and gains 1 **from P2** → net 0

So contract effect for P1: 0

→ P1 total: 5 + 0 = **5**

P2 total: 5 (base) + 1 (from contract as A0) - 1 (paid to P1) = 5

So both still 5.

---

#### 2. P1 = A0, P2 = A1

- Base payoff (P1): 0
- Contract:
  - P1 chose A0 → +1
  - P2 chose A1 → so P2 **pays 1** to others → so P1 **receives +1**
- So contract effect for P1: +1 (from P1's A0) +1 (from P2's A1) = +2
- **Total P1 payoff: 0 + 2 = 2**

Wait — let’s verify:

- P1 chose A0 → gets +1 from P2
- P2 chose A1 → P2 pays -1 → that -1 is distributed to others → so P1 gains 1
- So total contract gain: +1 (from P1's A0) +1 (from P2's A1) = +2
- Base: 0
- Result: 0 + 2 = 2

Yes.

P2: base = 3, contract: P2 chose A1 → pays -1, P1 chose A0 → so P2 receives +1 from P1 → so P2 gains 1 from that → net contract: -1 + 1 = 0 → total: 3 + 0 = 3

So P1 gets **2**, P2 gets 3.

---

#### 3. P1 = A1, P2 = A0

- Base payoff (P1): 3
- Contract:
  - P1 chose A1 → **pays -1**
  - P2 chose A0 → so P2 receives +1 → that comes from P1 → so P1 loses 1
- So contract effect: -1 (from P1's A1) -1 (from P2’s A0) = -2
- Total P1 payoff: 3 - 2 = **1**

Check:
- P1 chose A1 → pays 1 → loses 1
- P2 chose A0 → gets 1 from P1 → P1 loses 1
- So P1 loses 2 in contract
- Base: 3
- Total: 1

P2: base 0, contract: +1 (A0) -1 (from P1 because P1 chose A1) → net 0 → total 0

Wait: P2 chose A0 → gets +1 from others → so takes 1 from P1 → so P2 gains 1
P1 chose A1 → so P1 loses 1 to others → so P2 gains 1
But P2 only gets one +1 from their own A0 choice, not both.

So yes — P2 gets +1 from P2's A0, and gains another 1 from P1's A1 → so P2 gets +2?

Wait — no: the contract says:

- If a player chooses A0, they get +1 from others
- If a player chooses A1, they pay -1 to others

So P2: chose A0 → gets +1 → from P1
P1: chose A1 → pays -1 → to others → so gives 1 to P2

So P2 gains +1 (from A0) and +1 (from P1's A1), so **+2**

P2 total: base 0 + 2 = 2

But P1: base 3, pays -1 (A1), and loses 1 to P2 (because P2 is getting +1 from others, which comes from P1) → so -1 (from A1) -1 (from A0 of P2) = -2 → total 3 - 2 = 1

Yes.

So P1 gets 1, P2 gets 2.

---

#### 4. P1 = A1, P2 = A1

- Base payoff (P1): 3
- Contract:
  - P1 chose A1 → pays -1
  - P2 chose A1 → pays -1 → so P1 gains +1
- So contract effect: -1 +1 = 0
- Total P1 payoff: 3 + 0 = **3**

P2: base 3, pays -1 (A1), and P1 pays -1 → so P2 gets +1 from P1 → net: -1 +1 = 0 → total 3

So both get 3

---

### **Step 5: Summarize Augmented Payoffs for Player 1**

Now the full game matrix for P1 (Player 1) is:

|           | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | 5     | 2     |
| **P1 A1** | 1     | 3     |

Wait — let's double-check:

- (A0, A0): 5 → yes
- (A0, A1): 2 → yes
- (A1, A0): 1 → yes
- (A1, A1): 3 → yes

So P1's payoffs:
- If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5 (A0) vs 1 (A1) → so prefer A0
- If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 2 (A0) vs 3 (A1) → so prefer A1

Now, we want to find the **optimal mixed strategy** for P1 to maximize **expected payoff**, given that P2 is rational and will also play optimally.

But this is a **simultaneous game**, and we need to find the **Nash equilibrium** (or best response), assuming both players are rational.

Let’s find the **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 6: Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MNE)**

Let:
- P1 choose A0 with probability `p`, A1 with `1-p`
- P2 choose A0 with probability `q`, A1 with `1-q`

We want P1 to choose p to maximize expected payoff, **in response to P2’s q**.

But for Nash equilibrium, P1's strategy must be a best response to P2’s, and vice versa.

So we find the value of `q` such that P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Then we solve for `p` such that P2 is indifferent.

#### Step 6.1: Find P1's best response to P2’s `q`

Expected payoff for P1:

- If P1 chooses A0:
  - With prob `q`: P2=A0 → P1 gets 5
  - With prob `1-q`: P2=A1 → P1 gets 2
  - So EU(A0) = 5q + 2(1-q) = 5q + 2 - 2q = 3q + 2

- If P1 chooses A1:
  - With prob `q`: P2=A0 → P1 gets 1
  - With prob `1-q`: P2=A1 → P1 gets 3
  - So EU(A1) = 1*q + 3*(1-q) = q + 3 - 3q = 3 - 2q

P1 is indifferent when:
3q + 2 = 3 - 2q  
3q + 2q = 3 - 2  
5q = 1  
q = 0.2

So if P2 plays A0 with probability 0.2 (20%), then P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Thus, any mixed strategy (including pure) is best response — but for equilibrium, P1 will play a mix only if P2 is at the indifference point.

Now, **what does P2 do?**

We need to find P2’s best response to P1’s strategy.

But we must analyze P2’s payoffs **under the contract too**.

Wait! Important: we need to **check the contract from P2’s perspective**.

We have so far computed P1’s payoffs with contract.

But P2’s payoffs also include the contract, and P2 will choose to maximize **their own total payoff**.

So we need to compute P2’s payoffs to find equilibrium.

Let’s go back and compute P2’s total payoffs under the contract.

---

### **Step 7: Compute P2’s Augmented Payoffs**

We need to compute P2’s total payoff for each joint action.

Recall:
- If P2 chooses A0: gets +1 from P1
- If P2 chooses A1: pays -1 to P1
- If P1 chooses A0: P2 gets +1 from P1
- If P1 chooses A1: P2 pays -1 to P1

So for P2:

Contract effect on P2 =  
(1 if P2=A0) - (1 if P2=A1) + (1 if P1=A0) - (1 if P1=A1)

Because:
- P2 gets +1 when chooses A0
- P2 loses -1 when chooses A1
- P2 gains +1 when P1 chooses A0 (P1 pays)
- P2 loses -1 when P1 chooses A1 (P1 pays to P2)

But again, let's compute per cell.

---

#### Case 1: P1=A0, P2=A0

- Base: P2 gets 5
- Contract:
  - P2 chose A0 → +1
  - P1 chose A0 → so P2 gets +1 from P1
- So P2 gains +2 → total: 5 + 2 = **7**

P1: base 5, and pays 1 to P2 (because P2 chose A0), and gains 1 from P2 (because P1 chose A0) → net 0 → total 5 → matches.

So P2: 7

---

#### Case 2: P1=A0, P2=A1

- Base: P2 gets 3
- Contract:
  - P2 chose A1 → pays -1
  - P1 chose A0 → so P2 gains +1 from P1
- So contract: -1 +1 = 0 → total: 3 + 0 = **3**

---

#### Case 3: P1=A1, P2=A0

- Base: P2 gets 0
- Contract:
  - P2 chose A0 → +1
  - P1 chose A1 → so P2 gets +1 from P1
- So +1 +1 = +2 → total: 0 + 2 = **2**

---

#### Case 4: P1=A1, P2=A1

- Base: P2 gets 3
- Contract:
  - P2 chose A1 → pays -1
  - P1 chose A1 → so P2 gets +1 from P1
- So -1 +1 = 0 → total: 3 + 0 = **3**

So P2’s payoff matrix:

|           | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | 7     | 3     |
| **P1 A1** | 2     | 3     |

Now we can find the **Nash equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 8: Solve for Nash Equilibrium**

We now have:

**P1’s payoff matrix:**
|           | P2 A0 (q) | P2 A1 (1-q) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| P1 A0 (p) | 5         | 2           |
| P1 A1 (1-p)| 1         | 3           |

**P2’s payoff matrix:**
|           | P2 A0 (q) | P2 A1 (1-q) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| P1 A0 (p) | 7         | 3           |
| P1 A1 (1-p)| 2         | 3           |

We’ll find the mixed strategy equilibrium where each player is indifferent.

#### Find P2’s mixed strategy that makes P1 indifferent.

We already did: P1 indifferent when:
EU(A0) = 3q + 2  
EU(A1) = 3 - 2q  
Set equal: 3q + 2 = 3 - 2q → 5q = 1 → q = 0.2

So if P2 plays A0 with **20%**, P1 is indifferent.

Now, what about P2?

Find P1’s strategy p such that P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

P2’s expected payoff:

- If P2 chooses A0:
  - With prob p: P1=A0 → payoff 7
  - With prob 1-p: P1=A1 → payoff 2
  - EU(A0) = 7p + 2(1-p) = 7p + 2 - 2p = 5p + 2

- If P2 chooses A1:
  - With prob p: P1=A0 → payoff 3
  - With prob 1-p: P1=A1 → payoff 3
  - EU(A1) = 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

P2 is indifferent when:
5p + 2 = 3  
5p = 1  
p = 0.2

So if P1 plays A0 with **20%**, P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

Thus, at p = 0.2, q = 0.2, both players are indifferent, and thus both are best responding.

So **(p=0.2, q=0.2)** is a **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 9: Optimal Strategy for You (Player 1)**

Since this is a **symmetric Nash equilibrium** (in mixed strategy), **the best strategy for you is to randomize with p=0.2 (A0) and 1-p=0.8 (A1)**.

This maximizes your **expected payoff** given that the opponent will play optimally in the equilibrium.

So you should choose:
- A0: 20%
- A1: 80%

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 1):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, there is no additional payments in either direction.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 1, Player 2

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Game and Payoffs

We are playing a simultaneous move game with two players, and we are Player 2 (the "you" in the description).

Actions: A0, A1

Payoff matrix (from Player 2's perspective):

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | 5            | 0            |
| **Player 2: A1** | 3            | 3            |

But wait — let’s double-check the payoffs as described:

- (A0, A0): You (P2) get 5
- (A0, A1): You get 0
- (A1, A0): You get 3
- (A1, A1): You get 3

So yes, the payoff matrix for Player 2 is:

|        | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **P2 A0** | 5     | 0     |
| **P2 A1** | 3     | 3     |

Now, we need to find the optimal strategy for Player 2 — that is, a probability distribution over A0 and A1 to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 is also rational and will try to maximize their own payoff (and may be using a mixed strategy).

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Game — Is There a Nash Equilibrium?

Let’s find the Nash equilibrium (NE), since both players are rational.

Let’s suppose:
- Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with probability (1-p)
- Player 2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with probability (1-q)

We'll first compute Player 2’s expected payoff as a function of q and p.

Expected payoff for Player 2:

```
E2 = q * [p*5 + (1-p)*0] + (1-q) * [p*3 + (1-p)*3]
```

Simplify:

- First term: q * (5p)
- Second term: (1-q) * [3p + 3(1-p)] = (1-q) * [3p + 3 - 3p] = (1-q)*3

So:
```
E2 = 5pq + 3(1 - q)
```

Now, Player 2 wants to maximize E2 with respect to q, for a given p.

Let’s treat this as a linear function in q:

E2 = 5p q + 3 - 3q = q(5p - 3) + 3

So:
- If 5p - 3 > 0 → p > 3/5 = 0.6 → then E2 increases with q → Player 2 should set q = 1 (always play A0)
- If 5p - 3 < 0 → p < 0.6 → E2 decreases with q → Player 2 should set q = 0 (always play A1)
- If p = 0.6 → E2 is constant in q → any q is fine

So Player 2’s best response is:
- q = 1 if p > 0.6
- q = 0 if p < 0.6
- Any q if p = 0.6

Now, let’s find Player 1’s best response.

Player 1’s payoff matrix (from P1’s perspective):

|        | P2 A0 | P2 A1 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **P1 A0** | 5     | 3     |
| **P1 A1** | 0     | 3     |

So P1’s expected payoff:
Let q = P(P2 chooses A0)

E1 = p * [q*5 + (1-q)*3] + (1-p) * [q*0 + (1-q)*3]

Simplify:
- First term: p * [5q + 3(1 - q)] = p * [5q + 3 - 3q] = p*(2q + 3)
- Second term: (1-p)*3

So:
E1 = p(2q + 3) + 3(1 - p) = 2pq + 3p + 3 - 3p = 2pq + 3

So E1 = 2pq + 3

This is increasing in p if q > 0, and constant in p if q = 0.

So:
- If q > 0 → E1 increases with p → P1 wants to play p = 1
- If q = 0 → E1 = 3 regardless of p → any p is fine

So P1’s best response:
- p = 1 if q > 0
- Any p if q = 0

Now, let’s find NE.

Try the case where:
- Player 2 plays q = 0 → always A1
Then Player 1’s best response: p = 1 → always A0
Now, check: if P1 plays p = 1, P2’s best response: since p = 1 > 0.6, P2 should play A0 → but we assumed P2 plays A1 → contradiction

Try: P2 plays q = 1 (always A0)
Then P1’s best response: since q > 0 → p = 1
Now, P1 plays p = 1 → then P2's best response: p = 1 > 0.6 → so P2 should play A0 → consistent.

So is (p=1, q=1) a NE?

Check:
- P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 5 if A0, 0 if A1 → so P2 prefers A0 → so plays A0 → correct
- P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 5 if A0, 3 if A1 → so P1 prefers A0 → so plays A0 → correct

Yes! (A0, A0) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

Are there others?

Try: Mixed strategy NE — where Player 1 mixes between A0 and A1 to make P2 indifferent.

We found earlier that P2 is indifferent when p = 0.6

So if Player 1 plays p = 0.6, then P2’s expected payoff is the same for A0 and A1.

Let’s compute:
- If P2 plays A0: E = 5*(0.6) + 0*(0.4) = 3
- If P2 plays A1: E = 3*(0.6) + 3*(0.4) = 1.8 + 1.2 = 3 → same

So P2 is indifferent → any q is best response.

Now, for P1 to be willing to mix, P2 must make P1 indifferent between A0 and A1.

P1’s expected payoff:
- If P1 plays A0: gets 5*q + 3*(1-q) = 5q + 3 - 3q = 2q + 3
- If P1 plays A1: gets 0*q + 3*(1-q) = 3 - 3q

Set equal:
2q + 3 = 3 - 3q
2q = -3q
5q = 0 → q = 0

So P1 is indifferent only if q = 0 → P2 always plays A1

But if q = 0, then P2 plays A1 always.

Then for P1:
- A0 gives: 5*0 + 3*1 = 3
- A1 gives: 0*0 + 3*1 = 3 → same

So P1 is indifferent → can mix.

But now check P2: if P1 plays p = ? (could be anything), but let’s see what P2 wants.

If P1 is playing some p, then P2’s best response depends on p.

But in this case: if P2 plays A1 (q=0), then P1 is willing to mix only if P2 always plays A1 → but then P2 should be choosing A1.

But is this consistent?

Let’s suppose P2 plays A1 (q=0), and P1 plays p = 0.6 (or any p).

Then P2’s payoff:
- If P2 plays A1: gets 3 regardless of P1 → so A1 is always good

But can P2 do better?

- If P1 plays p = 0.6 → P2’s payoff from A0: 5*0.6 + 0*0.4 = 3 → same as A1
→ so P2 is indifferent → can play A0 or A1

But if P2 chooses A0, then P1 gets:
- A0: 5*1 + 3*0 = 5
- A1: 0*1 + 3*0 = 0 → so P1 should play A0, not mix → breaks the mixed strategy

Ah — here's the issue.

For a mixed strategy NE where P1 mixes, we need P2 to play q = 0 (to make P1 indifferent).

But if P2 plays q = 0 (A1 always), then if P1 plays A0: they get 5 if P2 plays A0, but P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 3 from A0, 3 from A1 → so P1 is indifferent → okay.

So any p is best response for P1.

But for P2: given P1 plays p, what is P2's best response?

P2’s expected payoff from A0: 5p
From A1: 3 (always)

So P2 should play A0 only if 5p > 3 → p > 0.6

But P1 can choose p arbitrarily — but if P2 plays q=0 (A1 always), then for P1 to mix, we only require that p doesn’t matter — but P2’s best response depends on p.

But if p < 0.6 → P2 should play A1 → which is consistent with q=0

If p > 0.6 → P2 should play A0 → contradicts q=0

So the only way q=0 is a best response is if p ≤ 0.6

But P1 is indifferent as long as P2 plays A1 → so P1 can choose p ≤ 0.6

So there is a mixed strategy NE where:
- P2 plays A1 with probability 1
- P1 plays A0 with probability p ≤ 0.6 (e.g., any p ≤ 0.6)

But is this stable?

Wait — but if P2 plays A1, and P1 plays p ≤ 0.6, then P2 gets 3 whether they play A0 or A1, so they are indifferent — so playing A1 is okay.

But in fact, any p ≤ 0.6 works.

But for the equilibrium, both players are playing best responses.

So we have multiple Nash equilibria:

1. Both play A0: (p=1, q=1)
2. P2 plays A1 (q=0), P1 plays any p ≤ 0.6

But we also need to check if (A1, A1) is a NE.

P1 plays A1, P2 plays A1 → payoff: (3,3)

Check P1: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets:
- A0: 3
- A1: 3 → indifferent → can play A1
P2: if P1 plays A1, P2 gets:
- A0: 0
- A1: 3 → so prefers A1

So (A1, A1) is also a NE!

Wait — let's confirm:

- If P1 plays A1, P2’s payoff: A0 → 0, A1 → 3 → so P2 plays A1
- If P2 plays A1, P1’s payoff: A0 → 3, A1 → 3 → indifferent → so playing A1 is okay

So yes! (A1, A1) is a NE.

But can both play A0? Yes — as shown.

So there are three pure strategy NE:
1. (A0, A0)
2. (A1, A1)
3. (A0, A1)? Let’s check:

P1: A0, P2: A1 → payoffs: (3,0)

P1: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 from A0, 3 from A1 → indifferent → so can play A0
P2: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 0 from A0, 3 from A1 → so prefers A1 → so yes

So (A0, A1) is also a NE?

Wait — payoff (3,0)

- P1: gets 3 from A0, 3 from A1 → indifferent → so playing A0 is okay
- P2: if P1 plays A0 → P2 gets 0 from A0, 3 from A1 → so prefers A1 → so yes, playing A1 is best response

So (A0, A1) is a NE.

Wait a minute — that’s surprising.

But let’s double-check:

- P1: A0, P2: A1 → payoffs: (3,0)
- P1: if P2 plays A1, what does P1 get?
  - A0: 3
  - A1: 3 → so P1 is indifferent → A0 is best response
- P2: if P1 plays A0, what does P2 get?
  - A0: 0
  - A1: 3 → so prefers A1 → so playing A1 is best response

So yes, (A0, A1) is a NE.

Similarly, (A1, A0): payoffs (0,3)

- P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 5 from A0, 0 from A1 → so prefers A0 → not A1 → so can’t play A1 → so not a NE

So not a NE.

So possible NE: (A0,A0), (A1,A1), (A0,A1)

But (A0, A1) gives P2 only 0 — very bad.

We are Player 2 — we want to maximize **our** payoff.

So from P2’s perspective:
- (A0,A0): 5
- (A1,A1): 3
- (A0,A1): 0

So obviously, (A0,A0) is best for P2.

But is it stable? Yes — but only if P1 plays A0.

But if we are rational, and believe P1 is rational, and we know P1 has options, can we coordinate?

But there is a **coordination problem** — we both want to play A0, but P1 might be tempted to switch.

Wait — but in (A0,A0), both get 5 — best for both.

In (A1,A1), both get 3 — worse.

But is (A0,A0) the only efficient Nash equilibrium?

But can we get better than 5?

No — maximum is 5.

But the issue: is (A0,A0) the only NE that gives P2 5?

Yes.

But P1: in (A0,A0), P1 gets 5 — if P1 deviates to A1, and P2 is still A0, P1 gets 3 — worse.

So P1 has no incentive.

Now, what if P2 plays only A1?

Then P2 gets 3 in all cases.

But P1: if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 regardless — so P1 could play A0 or A1.

But if P1 plays A0, P2 gets 0 — bad.

So if P2 is uncertain, they might get 0.

But we want to maximize expected points.

But we don’t know what P1 will do.

So what is the **rational choice**?

We need to consider the **rational prediction** of the other player’s behavior.

In game theory, if there are multiple NE, we might use **focal point** or **risk dominance**.

But let’s look at the game:

This is a **coordination game** with a conflict of interest.

Payoff matrix (P2's payoffs):

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|---------|----|----|
| A0      | 5  | 0  |
| A1      | 3  | 3  |

P1’s payoff:

| P2 \ P1 | A0 | A1 |
|---------|----|----|
| A0      | 5  | 3  |
| A1      | 0  | 3  |

So both players prefer (A0,A0), but:
- If P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 (5 vs 3)
- If P1 plays A1, P2 gets 0 or 3 — so prefers A1
- But P1: if P2 plays A0, P1 gets 5 or 3 → prefers A0
- If P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 or 3 → indifferent

So there is a **conflict of interest** only in one direction.

But the best joint outcome is (A0,A0).

Now, in such games, a common solution is that players coordinate on the Pareto-efficient outcome — (A0,A0).

But P1 might not play A0 if they think P2 might play A1.

For example, if P1 thinks P2 will play A1, then P1 is indifferent between A0 and A1, but P2 gets 0 if P1 plays A0.

But P2’s best response to (A0) from P1 is A0.

If P2 plays a mixed strategy, say q, then P1’s payoff from playing A0 is: 5q + 3(1-q) = 2q + 3
From A1: 3

So if q > 0 → A0 gives more → so P1 will play A0

Only if q = 0 → then A0 and A1 give 3 → indifferent

So P1 will play A0 if P2 ever plays A0 with positive probability.

So if P2 plays A0 with any positive probability, P1 plays A0.

Then P2’s best response: if P1 plays A0, P2 gets:
- A0: 5
- A1: 3
→ so prefers A0

So if P2 plays A0 with positive probability, P1 plays A0, and then P2 plays A0.

So the only consistent strategy is to play A0 with probability 1.

Therefore, playing A0 with probability 1 is a Nash equilibrium, and it’s the **only** one where both players get their highest payoff.

Any mixed strategy would risk playing A1, which gives P2 only 3, and might cause P1 to play A1, but P1 only gets 3 in that case anyway.

But if P2 plays A0 with probability 0, then P1 is indifferent → might play A1 → then P2 gets 3.

But P2 could get 5 if P1 plays A0.

So if P2 plays A0 with probability 1, P1 plays A0, P2 gets 5.

If P2 plays A1 with probability 1, P1, indifferent, might play A1 → P2 gets 3

But P1 might play A0 — then P2 gets 0 → worse.

So playing A1 is risky and leads to a guaranteed 3 if P1 is rational.

But if P2 plays A0 with probability 1, and P1 is rational, P1 will play A0 → P2 gets 5

So **the only safe strategy that maximizes payoff is to play A0 with probability 1**

But is there a reason not to?

Wait — the contract was proposed, but rejected.

But the contract was: no additional payments for choosing A0 or A1 — so it did not change payoffs.

So it's inactive.

So we ignore it.

Now, is there any incentive to mix?

Suppose we play A0 with probability 99%, A1 with 1%.

Then P1: if we mix, P1 gets:
- A0: 5*0.99 + 3*0.01 = 4.95 + 0.03 = 4.98
- A1: 3

So P1 prefers A0 → plays A0

Then P2’s expected payoff: 5 with 99% chance, 3 with 1% chance → so 5*0.99 + 3*0.01 = 4.95 + 0.03 = 4.98

But if we play A0 with 100%, we get 5.

So better.

Any mix leads to lower expected payoff.

Only if we are uncertain about P1, but since P1 is rational and wants to maximize their payoff, and A0 gives them higher payoff when P2 might play A0, they will play A0.

And P2 getting 5 is better than 4.98.

So playing A0 with probability 1 is best.

But what if P1 thinks P2 might play A1?

But if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 3 either way — but P2 gets 0 from A0, 3 from A1.

But if P1 plays A0, and P2 plays A1, P2 gets 0 — very bad.

So if P2 is expected to play A1, P1 is indifferent — but P2 might be punished.

But P2 wants to avoid that.

So the only way to guarantee a good outcome is to play A0.

Therefore, **the optimal strategy for Player 2 is to play A0 with probability 100%**.

---

### Final Choice

We choose:
- A0: 100
- A1: 0

Sum = 100 → valid.

This ensures:
- If P1 plays A0 (which they will, because they prefer it if P2 plays A0), we get 5.
- If P1 plays A1, we get 3 (but P1 only gets 3 either way, so they might play A1, but why? They get same payoff, but if they play A0, they get 5 if P2 plays A0 — which P2 will)

But since P2 plays A0 for sure, P1 will play A0 to get 5.

So we get 5.

Any other strategy risks lower payoff.

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to sign a payment contract. A contract specifies a payment value for each action that a player can play. Here is the contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

At this stage, you are asked to decide whether to sign the contract. The contract becomes active only if all players sign it.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (from my perspective as Player 2)

Without contract:
- (Me: A0, Other: A0): I get 5, Other gets 5
- (Me: A0, Other: A1): I get 0, Other gets 3
- (Me: A1, Other: A0): I get 3, Other gets 0
- (Me: A1, Other: A1): I get 3, Other gets 3

## Step 2: Calculate payoffs with the contract

The contract states: If a player plays A1, they pay 1 point to the other player.

With contract:
- (Me: A0, Other: A0): I get 5, Other gets 5
- (Me: A0, Other: A1): I get 0 + 1 = **1**, Other gets 3 - 1 = **2**
- (Me: A1, Other: A0): I get 3 - 1 = **2**, Other gets 0 + 1 = **1**
- (Me: A1, Other: A1): I get 3 - 1 + 1 = **3**, Other gets 3 - 1 + 1 = **3**

## Step 3: Analyze the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium

**Without contract:**
For me to be indifferent between A0 and A1, if Other plays A0 with probability p:
- E(A0) = 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- E(A1) = 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Setting equal: 5p = 3, so p = 3/5

My expected payoff in mixed Nash: **3 points**

**With contract:**
For me to be indifferent between A0 and A1:
- E(A0) = 5p + 1(1-p) = 4p + 1
- E(A1) = 2p + 3(1-p) = 3 - p

Setting equal: 4p + 1 = 3 - p, so 5p = 2, giving p = 2/5

My expected payoff in mixed Nash: 4(2/5) + 1 = **2.6 points**

## Step 4: Compare outcomes

- The pure Nash equilibria remain the same: (A0, A0) gives 5 points and (A1, A1) gives 3 points in both cases
- However, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium gives me **lower expected payoff with the contract** (2.6 vs 3 points)
- The contract actually **decreases cooperation** in the mixed equilibrium (A0 probability drops from 3/5 to 2/5)

## Step 5: Decision

The contract makes me worse off in the mixed strategy equilibrium and doesn't improve the pure equilibria. There's no clear mechanism by which it helps coordinate on the better (A0, A0) outcome.

Let me analyze this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understanding the Payoff Matrix

As Player 1, my payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): I get **5** points
- (A0, A1): I get **0** points  
- (A1, A0): I get **3** points
- (A1, A1): I get **3** points

## Step 2: Identifying Nash Equilibria

Let me check each outcome:
- **(A0, A0)**: If I deviate to A1, I get 3 instead of 5 (worse). If Player 2 deviates, they get 3 instead of 5 (worse). ✓ Nash equilibrium
- **(A1, A1)**: If I deviate to A0, I get 0 instead of 3 (worse). If Player 2 deviates, they get 0 instead of 3 (worse). ✓ Nash equilibrium

This is a coordination game with two pure Nash equilibria.

## Step 3: Analyzing My Best Response

Given Player 2's likely action:
- If Player 2 plays A0: I prefer A0 (5 points) over A1 (3 points)
- If Player 2 plays A1: I prefer A1 (3 points) over A0 (0 points)

Critical threshold: I should play A0 only if I believe Player 2 will play A0 with probability > 60%.

## Step 4: Interpreting the Contract Rejection

The proposed contract would have penalized A1, making (A0, A0) the dominant outcome. **Player 2 rejected this contract.**

This rejection signals that:
- Player 2 wants to maintain the option to play A1
- Player 2 likely doesn't trust coordination on (A0, A0)
- Player 2 may prefer the safer A1 strategy (which guarantees 3 points regardless)

## Step 5: Optimal Strategy

Given the contract rejection, Player 2 is more likely to play A1 than A0. Since:
- A1 guarantees me 3 points regardless of Player 2's choice
- A0 risks getting 0 points if Player 2 plays A1
- The signal from rejecting the contract suggests lower probability of Player 2 playing A0

**The optimal strategy is to play A1 with certainty.**

Let's analyze this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the original game without the contract

We are Player 2 in a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

The payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2) is:

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 2: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

This is a **coordination game with a preference for A0**, but note:
- If both choose A0: both get 5 (best outcome for both).
- If one chooses A0 and the other A1: the one who chose A1 gets 3, the one who chose A0 gets 0.
- If both choose A1: both get 3.

So:
- A0 is strictly better than A1 when the other player chooses A0 (5 > 3).
- A1 is better than A0 when the other player chooses A1 (3 > 0).
- If you think the other player will play A0, you want to play A0.
- If you think the other player will play A1, you want to play A1.
- But if both play A0, it’s better than both playing A1.

So this is a **mixed-strategy coordination game** with two pure Nash equilibria:
1. (A0, A0): both get 5
2. (A1, A1): both get 3

Also, (A0, A1) and (A1, A0) are not equilibria because at least one player wants to deviate.

So there are two pure Nash equilibria, and we may expect players to coordinate on one of them.

But since we are playing without a contract, and no communication is allowed, we must choose a strategy (a probability distribution) that is optimal **given uncertainty** about the other player.

But we must **maximize our own expected points**.

Now — the key twist: **a contract was proposed but rejected by Player 2** (that is, **you**).

So the contract is **not active** — we play the **original game**.

But the contract was:
- If a player chooses A1, they pay 3 points, which are distributed equally to the other players.

So if both players chose A1, each would pay 3 points, and thus lose 3 points, but receive 3 points from the other player. So net effect: each pays 3 and receives 3 → net 0?

Wait: **"they pay an additional payment of 3 point(s), distributed equally among the other players."**

So if you choose A1, you pay 3 points, and these 3 points are split equally among the other players.

There are **two players**, so if you choose A1, you pay 3, and the other player receives 1.5 (3 / 2).

But since this is **rejected by Player 2**, we don't have to deal with it. The payment **does not happen**.

So **we ignore the contract**, and play the original game.

---

### Step 2: What should our strategy be?

We want to maximize our expected payoff.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that Player 1 plays A0
- $ q $ = probability that we (Player 2) play A0 → so $ 1 - q $ = probability we play A1

Our expected payoff:

$$
EU = q \cdot [p \cdot 5 + (1 - p) \cdot 0] + (1 - q) \cdot [p \cdot 3 + (1 - p) \cdot 3]
$$

Simplify:

$$
EU = q(5p) + (1 - q)(3)
$$

$$
EU = 5pq + 3 - 3q
$$

We want to choose $ q $ to maximize this, **given that we don’t know $ p $**.

But since we don’t know $ p $, we must assume the worst case or think about rational play.

But in game theory, if both players are rational and symmetric, they might aim to play a **Nash equilibrium**.

Main equilibria:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

But (A0, A0) is strictly better for both, so if players can coordinate, they should play A0.

But can we force that?

We have **no communication**, so we can’t coordinate.

In the absence of coordination, a reasonable approach is to find **symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s find the symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium.

Suppose both players play A0 with probability $ q $.

Then, for Player 2 to be indifferent between A0 and A1, the expected payoff of A0 must equal that of A1.

Compute expected payoff of A0 (if opponent plays A0 w.p. q, A1 w.p. 1 - q):

- A0 vs opponent: $ q \cdot 5 + (1 - q) \cdot 0 = 5q $
- A1 vs opponent: $ q \cdot 3 + (1 - q) \cdot 3 = 3 $

Set them equal for indifference:

$$
5q = 3 \Rightarrow q = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
$$

So in symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

Let’s verify this is a Nash equilibrium.

If Player 1 plays q = 0.6 (A0), what is Player 2’s best response?

- EU(A0) = 0.6 * 5 + 0.4 * 0 = 3
- EU(A1) = 0.6 * 3 + 0.4 * 3 = 3

So Player 2 is indifferent → any mix is a best response → so playing 60% A0 is a best response.

Same from the other side.

Therefore, **(60% A0, 40% A1) is a symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Now, which equilibrium do we want?

We also have (A0, A0) — pure strategy equilibrium. But is it stable?

If we play A0, and expect opponent to play A0, then we get 5. But if we believe they might play A1, then A0 gives us 0, while A1 gives 3.

So unless we are confident the opponent will play A0, we might be wary.

But if both players are rational and aim to maximize their own payoff, and know that (A0, A0) is best, but there is a risk of miscoordination, a safer bet might be the mixed equilibrium.

But here's the thing: **if both players play A0**, we both get 5 — best outcome.

So if we coordinate on A0, we get high payoff.

But since we can’t communicate, and opponent may choose A1 (e.g., if they think we play A0), then they’d get 3 instead of 0, so they may prefer to play A1.

But if they play A1, and we play A0, we get 0.

So a rational player might think: "if I play A0, and opponent plays A0 → 5; if opponent plays A1 → 0. Risky."

"Alternatively, if I play A1, I get 3 no matter what."

So playing A1 gives **expected minimum payoff of 3** — safe.

Playing A0 gives **expected maximum 5, but minimum 0**.

So for a risk-averse player, A1 might be better.

But if both players are risk-neutral, they might try to coordinate on A0.

But in the absence of coordination, a natural focal point is the mixed strategy equilibrium.

Alternatively, consider: **if we believe the opponent will play A0 with high probability**, we should play A0.

But without information about the opponent, what’s the best strategy?

Another idea: **Since we are Player 2 and we know that the contract was rejected by us**, could that signal anything?

But the contract was proposed by Player 1. It says: if you play A1, you pay 3 points, split among others.

That means:
- If you play A1, you lose 3 points, but the other player gains 1.5.

So if Player 1 proposes this, they want to discourage A1, because it hurts them (they pay 3) but helps you (you gain 1.5).

But Player 2 **rejected** it.

So the rejection indicates that **we don’t want to be bound** by this contract.

But since it was rejected, we don’t have to worry about it.

However, **our rejection might signal that we are willing to do A1 more often**, because we don't want to be punished for it.

But the game is over; we are now playing.

But in the current decision, it's not about signaling; we are choosing a strategy to maximize expected payoff.

So, back to the point: the contract doesn’t exist. So we play the original game.

Now, what should we do?

Let’s compare the options.

Idea: **since A1 gives a guaranteed 3, and A0 gives 5 if opponent plays A0, but 0 if they play A1, we need to assess likely behavior.**

But we don’t know it.

But suppose both players are rational and symmetric. Then they’ll likely converge to the mixed strategy equilibrium where each plays A0 with 60%.

Why? Because otherwise, if one plays A0 100%, the other might deviate to A1 to get 3 instead of 0.

Similarly, if someone plays A1 often, the other might want to play A0 to exploit.

So the symmetric equilibrium is stable.

Moreover, it’s the only symmetric equilibrium.

Now, in that equilibrium, **our expected payoff is**:

We play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

Opponent plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

Then:

- Both A0: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 → payoff 5
- A0 vs A1: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 → payoff 0
- A1 vs A0: 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24 → payoff 3
- Both A1: 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16 → payoff 3

So total expected payoff:

$$
0.36 * 5 + 0.24 * 0 + 0.24 * 3 + 0.16 * 3 = 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = 3.0
$$

So 3.0 expected points.

Is there a better strategy?

What if we play A0 100%?

Then our payoff depends on opponent.

- If opponent plays A0 (q), we get 5
- If opponent plays A1 (1 - q), we get 0

So expected payoff = 5q

If opponent plays the symmetric equilibrium strategy (q = 0.6), then payoff = 3.0

Same as before.

But if opponent plays A0 with lower probability — say 0 — then we get 0.

So it’s riskier.

What if we play A1 100%?

Then we get 3 regardless of opponent’s choice.

Always 3.

So worst-case payoff: 3.

Best-case: 3.

So guaranteed 3.

Whereas playing A0 gives 0 if opponent plays A1, which has positive probability.

So A1 guarantees 3.

A0 has expected value 5q.

If q > 0.6, then playing A0 gives more than 3.

But if q < 0.6, then playing A0 gives less than 3.

In the symmetric equilibrium, q = 0.6, so same.

But if we believe the opponent is more likely to play A1, then A0 is worse.

But we have no information.

Therefore, **as a risk-neutral player, we cannot be sure**.

However, the mixed strategy equilibrium is **stable** — no player wants to deviate.

Moreover, if we play any pure strategy, the opponent might deviate.

Therefore, the safe, rational choice in games like this (with two pure equilibria, one better but risky) is to play the mixed strategy.

But let's go one step further.

Suppose we play A0 with 100% — we get 5 if opponent plays A0, 0 if they play A1.

Suppose opponent is symmetric — they play A0 with q.

Then our payoff is 5q.

To get 5q > 3, we need q > 0.6.

But if we believe q > 0.6, then we should play A0.

But if we are unsure, playing A0 is risky.

Now, consider the **other player's incentives**.

Player 1 proposed the contract because they don’t want to pay 3 if they play A1.

But they want others to play A0? Not necessarily.

But they are proposing a contract that penalizes A1, suggesting they want to avoid A1.

But they are the ones who proposed it — so they might be risk-averse to A1.

But we don’t know how the other player will play.

Still, given all this, the **most robust strategy is to play the mixed Nash equilibrium**.

But wait: there's another idea.

What if both players are rational and know that the symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium exists, and both will play it?

Then we should play it.

Alternatively, maybe they will play A0, because it’s better.

But that’s an assumption.

But without coordination, (A0, A0) is fragile.

In game theory, for such games (like the "Battle of the Sexes" or "Stag Hunt"), the mixed strategy equilibrium is a safe bet when coordination fails.

In fact, in this game, the (A0, A0) equilibrium is payoff-dominant but risk-dominant? Let’s check risk dominance.

Risk dominance: which equilibrium is more likely to be played if players are cautious?

We compute the **risk-dominant** equilibrium.

To do that, compare the product of the payoffs for deviations.

Standard method:

In a 2x2 game, for player i, the condition for Player 1’s A0 to be risk dominant over A1 is:

$$
u(A0,A0) \cdot u(A1,A1) > u(A0,A1) \cdot u(A1,A0)
$$

Wait: this is for the **other player’s** preferences.

The condition for the equilibrium (A0, A0) to be risk dominant over (A1, A1) is:

$$
\text{(Payoff when both play A0, opponent plays A0)} \times \text{(Payoff when both play A1, opponent plays A1)} > \text{(Payoff when play A0, opponent plays A1)} \times \text{(Payoff when play A1, opponent plays A0)}
$$

So:

- (A0, A0): 5
- (A1, A1): 3
- (A0, A1): 0
- (A1, A0): 3

So:
- Left: 5 × 3 = 15
- Right: 0 × 3 = 0

15 > 0 → so (A0, A0) is **risk dominant**.

Therefore, **(A0, A0) is both payoff-dominant and risk-dominant**.

In such a case, rational players might **coordinate on A0**.

But how?

We need a **focal point**.

In the absence of communication, but knowing that both players are rational, they might both choose A0, since it's the best mutual outcome.

Moreover, if both expect the other to play A0, they both get 5.

If one plays A0, the other gets 0 if they play A1 — not good.

So if we believe the opponent is rational, they will play A0.

Then we should play A0.

But if we believe they are not rational, or deviate, then we might want to play A1.

But in a game-theoretic setting, we assume rationality.

So the **rational focal point** is A0.

Therefore, **the most likely outcome is (A0, A0)**, and we should play A0.

But wait — if we play A0, and they play A1, we get 0 — bad.

But if we play A1, we always get 3.

So an A1 player is safe.

But in rational game theory, **mutual knowledge of rationality leads to (A0, A0)**.

For example, in the "Stag Hunt" game, there are two equilibria, and the risk-dominant one is often played.

Here, A0 is both payoff-dominant and risk-dominant.

So a reasonable prediction is that players will play A0.

In fact, many experiments show that in such games, players coordinate on the efficient equilibrium when it’s focal.

Moreover, the fact that we are **Player 2**, and we rejected the contract — what does that mean?

The contract was proposed by Player 1, and if we accepted it, we would be penalized for playing A1.

But we rejected it.

So we **don't want to be penalized for playing A1**.

That suggests we are **willing to play A1 more often**.

But in the current game, since the contract is **not active**, we have no cost.

But the fact that we rejected it suggests we are **not inclined to discourage ourselves from playing A1**.

Therefore, **we are more likely to opt for A1**.

So perhaps we do **not** want to play A0.

In fact, we may want to **delay coordination**, so we are more willing to play A1.

So maybe we **should not play A0**.

But we want to maximize our **own** points.

Let’s suppose the other player is rational and may play one of the equilibria.

But if they are rational, they might play A0.

But they might not, because we rejected the contract.

But they don’t know that.

We are only Player 2 — we don’t know what Player 1 thinks.

But the contract proposal and our rejection has **no impact** on the game — it’s not active.

So we cannot use that to gain information.

So the game is back to **original game**.

Now, consider: **if we play A0, and the other player is rational and also aims to play A0**, we get 5.

But if they are not, we get 0.

If we play A1, we get 3 for sure.

So is 3 a good payoff?

It’s less than 5, but better than 0.

Expected payoff if we play A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p

Expected payoff if we play A1: 3

So we should play A0 only if 5p > 3 → p > 0.6

So if we think the other player plays A0 with probability > 60%, then A0 is better.

Otherwise, A1 is better.

But what is p?

We don't know.

But if we assume rational players and focal point (A0, A0), then p ≈ 1.

Then A0 is better.

But if we trust that the other player will play A0, we should play A0.

But if we are cautious, we might play A1.

But there is no such thing as "cautious" when the better outcome is available.

Another idea: **solve for best response to the symmetric equilibrium**.

We already did: in symmetric mixed strategy, play A0 with 60% → then A0 and A1 give same payoff (3).

So indifferent.

But in that case, playing 60% A0 is a best response.

But can we do better?

Suppose we believe the other player plays A0 with high probability — say 1.

Then we should play A0.

But we don't know.

But given that the contract was proposed and rejected, could it be that we are more likely to play A1?

Yes — because we rejected a rule that deterred A1.

So perhaps we are **more inclined to play A1**, to take advantage of the fact that we’re not penalized.

But in the game, without penalty, playing A1 is still safe.

But if we play A1, we get 3.

If we play A0, we get 5 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1.

But if they are regular, they might play A0.

But if they are not, they might play A1.

In the absence of knowledge, the **symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium** is the **unique symmetric equilibrium**, and it is **evolutionarily stable**.

Moreover, in many such games, players end up at the mixed strategy.

But let’s calculate the payoff of playing A0 60%:

We already did: expected payoff 3.0

Playing A0 100%: expected 5p

If p is around 0.6 from equilibrium, then 3.0

But if p is higher, say 0.8, then 4.0 — better.

But we don’t know.

But there is no reason to believe p > 0.6.

In fact, the equilibrium is p = 0.6.

So in expectation, playing 60% A0 is optimal.

Moreover, any pure strategy is vulnerable.

Therefore, **the best strategy is to play the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Thus, we should play:

- A0: 60%
- A1: 40%

This is the rational choice in the absence of communication.

Additionally, the fact that we rejected the contract doesn't change anything — we are still allowed to be strategic.

But the rejection might suggest we are less risk-averse to A1.

But in the game itself, the mixed strategy balances the risk.

So final decision: play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

This is our best response to the symmetric equilibrium, and it maximizes our expected payoff under uncertainty.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, a payment contract was proposed to the players. It is NOT active though because some players rejected it. Here is the proposed contract that was selected via approval voting (proposed by Player 2):
- If a player chooses A0, there is no additional payments in either direction.
- If a player chooses A1, they pay an additional payment of 1 point(s), distributed equally among the other players.

Player(s) who rejected it: Player 2

You will now play the original game without any contract modifications.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal strategy for **Player 1** (you), given the game rules and the fact that the contract is **not active** (because Player 2 rejected it). So, we’re playing the **original game only**, without any additional payments.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix (Original Game)

We are in a simultaneous-move game. Let's represent the payoffs from Player 1's perspective:

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5      | 0      |
| **P1: A1**    | 3      | 3      |

From Player 1’s perspective:
- If you play A0 and P2 plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0 and P2 plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 and P2 plays A0 → you get 3
- If you play A1 and P2 plays A1 → you get 3

Note: The payoffs for P2 are symmetric in this matrix (though not perfectly symmetric in structure), but since we are only optimizing for **our** points, we focus on our own payoffs.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Strategic Structure

Let’s examine whether there are any dominant strategies.

**For Player 1:**
- If P2 plays A0:
  - A0 gives 5
  - A1 gives 3 → A0 is better
- If P2 plays A1:
  - A0 gives 0
  - A1 gives 3 → A1 is better

So no pure strategy is dominant. Your best action depends on what P2 does.

**For Player 2:**
Let’s check their payoffs from their perspective (same logic):
- P2: A0 vs P1: A0 → 5
- P2: A0 vs P1: A1 → 0
- P2: A1 vs P1: A0 → 3
- P2: A1 vs P1: A1 → 3

So:
- If P1 plays A0: P2 prefers A0 (5 > 3)
- If P1 plays A1: P2 is indifferent (0 vs 3) → prefers A1

So again, no dominant strategy.

This is **not** a prisoners’ dilemma, nor a coordination game in the usual sense. It’s more like a **mixed strategy equilibrium** game.

---

### Step 3: Look for Nash Equilibrium in Mixed Strategies

Let’s find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE).

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that **Player 1** plays A0
- $ q $ = probability that **Player 2** plays A0

We will find the strategy for Player 1 (i.e., value of $ p $) such that Player 2 is **indifferent** between A0 and A1. Then, we'll choose $ p $ so that Player 2 is indifferent — this is the standard way to find MSNE.

But since we are Player 1, and we want to **maximize our expected payoff**, we need to choose $ p $ such that, given Player 2's best response, we get the highest payoff.

Alternatively, in MSNE, each player makes the other indifferent.

---

#### Step 3.1: Make Player 2 indifferent between A0 and A1

Compute Player 2’s expected payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: gets 5 with prob $ p $, 0 with prob $ 1-p $ → expected = $ 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p $
- If P2 plays A1: gets 3 with prob $ p $, 3 with prob $ 1-p $ → expected = $ 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 $

Set them equal for indifference:
$$
5p = 3 \Rightarrow p = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
$$

So if Player 1 plays A0 with 60%, then Player 2 is indifferent between A0 and A1.

So in equilibrium, **Player 1 plays A0 with 60%**.

Now check what Player 2 should do: since they’re indifferent, they can play any mix.

Now, compute **Player 2’s best response** to **Player 1’s** strategy of $ p = 0.6 $

But actually, we now ask: **what should Player 1 do?**

If we assume **Player 2 is rational and will play a best response**, then we should consider: what is Player 2’s best response to Player 1’s mixed strategy?

- Player 2’s expected payoff from A0: $ 5p $
- From A1: $ 3 $

So:
- If $ 5p > 3 $ → $ p > 0.6 $ → Player 2 prefers A0
- If $ p < 0.6 $ → 5p < 3 → Player 2 prefers A1
- If $ p = 0.6 $ → indifferent → any mix

So if Player 1 plays $ p = 0.6 $, Player 2 is indifferent → so they might play any mix. But if Player 1 plays more than 0.6 (say, 70%), then Player 2 strictly prefers A0 → so they will play A0.

Similarly, if Player 1 plays less than 0.6, Player 2 will play A1.

Now, **Expected payoff to Player 1** under different strategies:

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays $ p $ (A0), and assume Player 2 best responds.

We’ll compute Player 1’s expected payoff:

- Case 1: $ p > 0.6 $ → P2 plays A0 → then P1’s expected payoff = $ 5p + 3(1-p) = 5p + 3 - 3p = 2p + 3 $
- Case 2: $ p < 0.6 $ → P2 plays A1 → then P1’s expected payoff = $ 0p + 3(1-p) = 3(1-p) $
- Case 3: $ p = 0.6 $ → P2 is indifferent → so best response is any mix, but Player 1 gets same payoff regardless because P2’s mix doesn't matter (we’ll verify)

Let’s compute payoff at $ p = 0.6 $:

- If P2 plays A0: P1’s payoff = 5
- If P2 plays A1: P1’s payoff = 3
- But since P2 is indifferent, they might play any $ q $. So total expected payoff for P1:
  $$
  \text{Exp} = q \cdot 5 + (1-q) \cdot 3 = 5q + 3 - 3q = 2q + 3
  $$
  This depends on $ q $. So if P2 plays A0 with high $ q $, P1 can get more.

But in a **Nash equilibrium**, both are best responding.

So what’s the **true mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**?

Standard method: Find $ p $ such that P2 is indifferent, and $ q $ such that P1 is indifferent.

We already did: for P2 to be indifferent, $ p = 0.6 $

Now, find $ q $ such that P1 is indifferent.

P1’s expected payoff:
- If P1 plays A0: $ 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q $
- If P1 plays A1: $ 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 $

Set equal: $ 5q = 3 \Rightarrow q = 0.6 $

So the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is:
- Player 1 plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%
- Player 2 plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%

In this equilibrium:
- P1’s expected payoff = $ 5q = 5 \times 0.6 = 3 $ if playing A0, or 3 if playing A1 → so 3 regardless.
- Alternatively: compute expected payoff from randomizing: at p=0.6, q=0.6 →
  - Prob both A0: 0.6×0.6 = 0.36 → 5 pts
  - P1 A0, P2 A1: 0.6×0.4 = 0.24 → 0 pts
  - P1 A1, P2 A0: 0.4×0.6 = 0.24 → 3 pts
  - Both A1: 0.4×0.4 = 0.16 → 3 pts
  - Total expected payoff for P1:  
    $ 0.36×5 + 0.24×0 + 0.24×3 + 0.16×3 = 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = 3.0 $

So **expected payoff = 3** in equilibrium.

---

### Step 4: Can Player 1 Do Better Than 3?

Suppose Player 1 deviates from 60%.

Case 1: Player 1 plays A0 with p = 1 (always A0)

Then Player 2’s best response: since $ 5p = 5 > 3 $, so P2 prefers A0 → plays A0

Then P1 gets: 5 (since both A0)

So **expected payoff = 5** — better than 3!

But wait — is this sustainable? Only if P2 believes P1 is playing A0 always.

But if Player 1 plays A0 always, then P2's best response is A0, and P1 gets 5.

Similarly, if Player 1 plays A0 with p = 0.9, then P2’s expected payoff from A0: $ 5×0.9 = 4.5 $, from A1: 3 → so still prefers A0. So P2 chooses A0.

Then P1’s payoff: 5×0.9 + 3×0.1 = 4.5 + 0.3 = 4.8

Similarly, if p = 0.7 → P2 still plays A0 → P1 gets 5×0.7 + 3×0.3 = 3.5 + 0.9 = 4.4

p = 0.6 → P2 indifferent → might still play A0 → then P1 gets 5×0.6 + 3×0.4 = 3 + 1.2 = 4.2, but if P2 plays A1, P1 gets 5×0.6 + 3×0.4? No:

Wait: if P1 plays A0 with 0.6, and P2 plays A1 with q=1 → then P1 gets: 0 with 0.6 prob, 3 with 0.4 prob → 0×0.6 + 3×0.4 = 1.2 → low.

But **P2 will not play A1** when p > 0.6 → because A0 gives higher expected payoff.

So if P1 plays p > 0.6, P2 plays A0 → so P1 gets:
$$
\text{Payoff} = 5p + 3(1-p) = 2p + 3
$$
This is increasing in p.

So maximum when p = 1 → payoff = 2×1 + 3 = 5

Now, if p < 0.6, then P2 prefers A1 → so P1’s payoff is:
$$
0×p + 3×(1-p) = 3(1-p)
$$
This is decreasing in p — maximum when p = 0 → payoff = 3

So best choice:
- If p > 0.6 → payoff = 2p + 3 → increasing → max at p = 1 → payoff = 5
- If p ≤ 0.6 → payoff = 3(1-p) → max at p=0 → payoff = 3

So best possible outcome for Player 1 is **5**, by playing A0 with probability 100%.

But is this a Nash equilibrium? No. Because if Player 1 plays A0 always, then Player 2’s best response is A0 (since payoff 5 > 3), so Player 2 plays A0 → P1 gets 5.

But what if Player 2 suspects this? Yes, **P2 plays A0** → so P1 gets 5.

But is Player 2’s best response really A0? Yes — if P1 plays A0 always.

So **the strategy profile (P1: A0 with 100%, P2: A0 with 100%)** is a **Nash equilibrium**?

Check:

- P1: if P2 plays A0, then P1’s best response: A0 gives 5, A1 gives 3 → so A0 is better → OK
- P2: if P1 plays A0, then P2’s best response: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → so A0 is best → OK

So **(A0, A0)** is a **pure strategy Nash equilibrium**.

Similarly, is (A1, A1) an equilibrium?
- P1: if P2 plays A1 → A1 gives 3, A0 gives 0 → so A1 is best
- P2: if P1 plays A1 → A1 gives 3, A0 gives 0 → A1 is best
→ So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium → payoff = 3

Also, (A0, A1): P1 gets 0 — if P2 plays A1, P1 would prefer A1 (3 > 0) → so not equilibrium.

(A1, A0): P2 gets 0 — if P1 plays A0, P2 prefers A0 → so not equilibrium.

So only two pure strategy equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1)

And one mixed strategy equilibrium: both play 60% A0.

But **(A0, A0)** gives P1 5 points — better than 3.

So **why wouldn’t Player 1 play A0 with probability 100%**?

Because there’s a risk: **if Player 2 plays A1**, P1 gets 0.

But Player 2, being rational, will not play A1 against P1 playing A0 — because A0 gives 5 vs 3.

So if P1 chooses A0 with 100%, P2 will choose A0 → P1 gets 5.

Hence, **Player 1 can guarantee 5 points by playing A0 with 100%**.

Is that correct?

Yes — because the game is simultaneous, but since the outcome is determined by both choices, and Player 2 has a strict incentive to play A0 if P1 plays A0, because:
- P2’s payoff: A0 → 5, A1 → 3 → so strictly better to play A0.

So Player 2 cannot do better than play A0.

Therefore, Player 1 can **commit** to A0 and **force** Player 2 to play A0 → resulting in **5 points for Player 1**.

This is the dominant strategy in this context: by playing A0 with certainty, Player 1 induces the optimal response from Player 2.

Even though the game is simultaneous, the **rational best response** of Player 2 to "A0 always" is "A0", so the outcome is (A0, A0), yielding 5 for P1.

Similarly, if P1 played A1 always, P2 would play A1 (gets 3 vs 0) → P1 gets 3.

So 5 is better.

Therefore, **Player 1 should play A0 with 100% probability**.

But wait: what if Player 2 is **not** rational? But the problem says players make decisions to maximize points — so we assume rationality.

Thus, **A0 with 100%** is not only consistent with equilibrium but also **maximizes expected payoff**.

Note: This is **not** a prisoner's dilemma — here, A0 is the coordinating action when both want to get 5.

In fact, this game has **multiple equilibria**, but (A0, A0) gives the highest payoff.

Since we can **achieve 5** with certainty by playing A0 strategically (and since Player 2 will best-respond optimally), this is the best plan.

Choose **A0 with 100%**, **A1 with 0%**.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2)

|  | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---|---|---|
| **My A0** | 5 | 0 |
| **My A1** | 3 | 3 |

## Step 2: Identify Nash equilibria

Let me check for pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- **(A0, A0)**: I get 5, they get 5. If I deviate to A1, I get 3 (worse). If they deviate to A1, they get 3 (worse). ✓ **Nash equilibrium**
- **(A1, A1)**: I get 3, they get 3. If I deviate to A0, I get 0 (worse). If they deviate to A0, they get 0 (worse). ✓ **Nash equilibrium**
- Other combinations are not equilibria (someone has incentive to deviate)

## Step 3: Compare the equilibria

- (A0, A0): Both players get 5 points - **Pareto optimal**
- (A1, A1): Both players get 3 points - Pareto dominated

## Step 4: Analyze the strategic situation

This is a **coordination game** with two pure strategy equilibria. Key observations:
- The contract is NOT active (I rejected it), so we play the original game
- A0 is risky: gives best outcome (5) if coordinated, but worst outcome (0) if mismatched
- A1 is safe: guarantees 3 points regardless of opponent's choice (maximin strategy)
- Both players face the same incentive structure (symmetric game)

## Step 5: Determine optimal strategy

In coordination games with a clear Pareto optimal equilibrium, rational players typically coordinate on the mutually beneficial outcome. Since:
- Both players want to maximize points
- (A0, A0) gives us both 5 points vs 3 points at (A1, A1)
- This serves as the natural **focal point** for coordination

The rational choice is to aim for the cooperative equilibrium.
